In 1990s he ran the UK comics titles \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" (1991–2002) and \"2000 AD\" (1995–2000).\n\nHe has since become a prolific author and received his first drama scriptwriting credit when BBC Radio 4 broadcast his radio play \"Island Blue: Ronald\" in June 2006. In 2007, he won the PAGE International Screenwriting Award in the short film category for his script \"Danny's Toys\", and was a finalist in the 2009 PAGE Awards with his script \"The Woman Who Screamed Butterflies\".\n\nBishop was sub-editor of the \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" and of \"Crisis\", before becoming the editor of the \"Megazine\" from 1991 to 2002. He became the editor of \"2000 AD\" just before Christmas 1995, staying four and a half years before resigning to become a freelance writer in the summer of 2000.\n\nBishop was responsible for discovering many new British talents, including:\n\nHe also, with collaborator Roger Langridge, contributed the insane asylum-set strip \"The Straitjacket Fits\".\n\nSince leaving \"2000 AD\" in the year 2000, Bishop has enjoyed a successful career as a freelance writer, working on novels of \"Doctor Who\", \"Judge Dredd, Heroes\" and \"Nikolai Dante\", as well as comic strip adventures of \"The Phantom\". His Doctor Who novel \"Who Killed Kennedy\", a journalist's point-of-view on the early Third Doctor stories, is highly popular with fans.\n\nDespite his successes as a comics editor and as a writer of prose, Bishop scripted many extremely unpopular comic strips in \"2000 AD\" and the \"Megazine\", including the comics adaptation of \"A Life Less Ordinary\", with art by Steve Yeowell. \"The Spacegirls\", a badly executed parody of the Spice Girls, is on the list of \"2000 AD\"'s 20 Worst Strips as chosen by fan rating on the official website. His most recent effort — a \"Fiends of the Eastern Front\" series for the \"Megazine\" — has proven much more popular with readers.\n\nAway from British comics, his work on \"The Phantom\" has won awards for the \"Best Phantom story of the year\" for Egmont on several occasions. Bishop introduced several new important characters to the Phantom mythos, such as the pirate queen Kate Sommerset, which grew so popular with readers that Bishop was able to make her the main character of five stories.\n\nIn 2006, Bishop also signed on to participate in the writing of stories for American publisher Moonstone Books' two collections of Phantom short stories, called Phantom Prose Anthologies.\n\nBishop's history of \"2000 AD\", in a series of articles under the banner name of \"Thrill Power Overload\", is the most comprehensive currently available. A revised, expanded and updated book version was published in the summer of 2007 to coincide with the 30th anniversary of \"2000 AD\". After that sold out, a paperback edition was issued in February 2009. An expanded edition with new material by Karl Stock was released in 2017.\n\nIn 2008, he appeared on 23 May edition of the BBC One quiz show \"The Weakest Link\", beating eight other contestants to win more than £1500 in prize money.\n\nIn 2010, Bishop received his first TV drama credit on the BBC medical drama series \"Doctors\", writing an episode called \"A Pill For Every Ill\", broadcast on 10 February.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Victoria Park lies approximately two miles south of Manchester city centre, between Rusholme and Longsight.\n\nIn 1836, a unique enterprise was undertaken by Richard Lane and Partners, architects. This was to establish a residential area to the east of Wilmslow Road, an \"estate\" of substantial houses in spacious grounds, where prosperous business and professional families could live. Lane was already noted for his public work in the neo-classical style, for example his town hall building at Chorlton on Medlock. The facade of this building remains on the Manchester Metropolitan University All Saints' Campus and formed part of the Mabel Tylecote Building.\n\nThe early years of the 'Victoria Park Company' were of mixed fortune. The original plans to develop land in a slightly different area, did not reach complete fruition, largely due to the fraud which led to the Foss v. Harbottle case. A cul-de-sac of villas was built opposite Whitworth Park, and these were later demolished for the construction of the Royal Infirmary. The fraud, or rather a complex connected series of frauds, related to the original development along Moss Lane East. Drainage techniques of the time were insufficient to support the developers' ambitions, and the large tranche of land they owned was not built on until several decades later. Some of the original villas remain on the southern side of Moss Lane East, between Wilmslow Road and Monton Street. They are attractive and spacious buildings.\n\nThe focus of the second, successful phase shifted to the better-quality land now known as Victoria Park. Professional people moved into the large houses, and from the earliest days a wide variety of nationalities was represented, notably a wealthy Prussian and Chinese merchant community. It had its own tollgates, walls and police. By 1850 about 50 houses by various architects had been built. Some villas and the sedate atmosphere of the area began to change at the beginning of the 20th century. After a long period of social disintegration, which began as early as 1920, the area has become more established and is now made up of a mixture of university residences, and rented and private accommodation. In March 1972, Manchester City Council designated a Conservation Area in Victoria Park.\n\nThe area has over 20 listed buildings and among its many significant buildings is the notable Grade I listed \"First Church of Christ, Scientist\" (now the Edgar Wood Centre) in Daisy Bank Road, the work of the Middleton architect Edgar Wood. Also of significance are \"Summerville\" on Daisy Bank Road; Hirstwood by Edward Salomons; Alfred Waterhouse's Xaverian College; and St Chrysostom's Church, the Anglican parish church designed by George T Redmayne at the corner of Oxford Place and Anson Road. St Chrysostom's Church backs onto the University of Manchester's oldest hall of residence, Dalton-Ellis Hall. Redmayne was the architect of the original Dalton Hall.\n\nThe Chinese Consulate-General is also located in a large mansion in Victoria Park, as is that of Pakistan.\n\nVictoria Park Campus of the university comprises several halls of residence. Among these are St Anselm Hall with Canterbury Court, Dalton-Ellis Hall, Hulme Hall (including Burkhardt House), St Gabriel's Hall and Opal Gardens Hall. St Anselm Hall is the only all-male hall left in the United Kingdom.\n\nA church was included in the line drawings issued by Lane in 1836. The building was started in the 1840s but was abandoned because the Victoria Park Company went bankrupt. Victoria Park was from 1850 included in the parish of St James, Birch, until 1878, when the new parish of St John Chrysostom was created from parts of the parish of St James and other parishes.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2167399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167399", "title": "Cookham", "text": "Cookham\n\nCookham is a historic village and civil parish on the River Thames in the north-easternmost corner of Berkshire in England. It is notable as the home of the artist Stanley Spencer. It is north-north-east of Maidenhead on the county boundary with Buckinghamshire and sits opposite the neighbouring village of Bourne End. Cookham forms the southernmost, and most rural part of the High Wycombe Urban Area. Cookham, and its adjoining villages of Cookham Rise and Cookham Dean (locally referred to as 'The Cookhams') have a combined population of 5,519 increasing to 5,779 at the 2011 Census. In 2011 \"The Daily Telegraph\" deemed Cookham Britain's second richest village.\n\nThe parish includes three villages:\n\nThe ancient parish of Cookham covered all of Maidenhead north of the London and Bath Road until this area's severance in 1894. It included the hamlets of Furze Platt and Pinkneys Green. There were several manors: Cookham, Lullebrook, Elington, Pinkneys, Great Bradley, Bullocks, White Place and Cannon Court.\n\nThe village's neighbours are Maidenhead to the south, Bourne End to the north, Marlow and Bisham to the west and Taplow to the east. The River Thames flows past Cookham on its way from Marlow to Taplow. Several islands in the Thames belong to Cookham, such as Odney Island, Formosa Island and Sashes Island which separates Cookham Lock from Hedsor Water. The Lulle Brook and the White Brook are tributaries of the River Thames which flow through the parish.\n\nA good amount of common land remains in the parish, such as Widbrook Common, Cookham Dean Common and Cock Marsh. Winter Hill affords views over the Thames Valley and Chiltern Hills. Cookham has a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) just to the north of the village, called Cock Marsh.\n\nThe area has been inhabited for thousands of years. There were several prehistoric burial mounds on Cock Marsh which were excavated in the 19th century and the largest stone axe ever found in Britain was one of 10,000 that has been dug up in nearby Furze Platt. The Roman road called the Camlet Way is reckoned to have crossed the Thames at Sashes Island, now cut by Cookham Lock, on its way from St. Albans to Silchester. By the 8th century there was an Anglo-Saxon abbey in Cookham and one of the later abbesses was Cynethryth, widow of King Offa of Mercia. It became the centre of a power struggle between Mercia and Wessex. Later King Alfred made Sashes Island one of his burhs to help defend against Viking invaders. There was a royal palace here where the Witan met in 997.\n\nIt is recorded in the Domesday Book as \"Cocheham\". The name may be from the Old English \"cōc\" + \"hām\", meaning 'cook village', i.e. 'village noted for its cooks', although the first element may be derived from the Old English \"cōc(e)\" meaning 'hill'.\n\nAlthough the earliest stone church building may date from 750, the earliest identifiable part of the current Holy Trinity parish church is the Lady Chapel, which was built in the late 12th century on the site of the cell of a female anchorite who lived next to the church and was paid a halfpenny a day by Henry II.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, most of Cookham was owned by Cirencester Abbey and the timber-framed 'Churchgate House' was apparently the Abbot's residence when in town. The \"Tarry Stone\" – still to be seen on the boundary wall of the Dower House – marked the extent of their lands.\n\nIn 1611 the estate at Cookham was the subject of the first ever country house poem, in Aemilia Lanyer's \"Description of Cookham\". In the poem 'Lanyer' pays tribute to her patroness, Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland, through a description of her residence as a paradise for literary women. The estate at Cookham did not actually belong to Margaret Clifford, but was rented for her by her brother while Clifford was undergoing a dispute with her husband.\n\nThe town people have resisted many attempts to enclose parts of the common land, including by the vicar, Rev. Thomas Whateley in 1799, Miss Isabella Fleming in 1869 (who wanted to stop nude bathing at Odney) and the Odney Estates in 1928 who wanted to enclose Odney Common. The Maidenhead and Cookham Commons Preservation Committee was formed and raised £2,738 to buy the manorial rights and the commons which were then donated to the National Trust by 1937. These included Widbrook, Cockmarsh, Winter Hill, Cookham Dean Commons, Pinkneys Green Common and Maidenhead Thicket.\n\nCookham is also home to the Chartered Institute of Marketing, based in Moor Hall.\n\nThe John Lewis Partnership, one of the country's premier retailers, which runs John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, has a residential training and holiday centre based at Odney.\n\nCookham's municipal services are provided by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. Cookham also has a parish council made up of fifteen councillors assisted by a part-time parish clerk and an assistant. The local health services are managed by the East Berkshire PCT (Primary Care Trust) – NHS Services.\n\nCookham village is on the A4094 between Maidenhead and Bourne End. The A404 from Maidenhead to High Wycombe is just to the west of Cookham Dean.\n\nCookham railway station, at Cookham Rise, is on the Marlow to Maidenhead branch line. There are two direct trains to and from London Paddington during the morning and evening rush hour. The rest of the trains require a change at Maidenhead.\n\nAn hourly bus service to Maidenhead, Bourne End and High Wycombe is provided by Arriva Shires & Essex six days a week; The river has a long stretch of moorings above Cookham Bridge.\n\nThe village is a tourist destination as it is a convenient base for a number of walks along the Thames Path and across National Trust property. There is a selection of restaurants and pubs in the High Street. The Stanley Spencer Gallery, based in the former Methodist chapel, also has a permanent exhibition of the artist's works.\n\n\n\nCookham is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

Other common substrings are \"A\", \"AB\", \"B\", \"BA\", \"BC\" and \"C\".\n\nGiven two strings, formula_1 of length formula_2 and formula_3 of length formula_4, find the longest string which is substring of both formula_1 and formula_3.\n\nA generalization is the k-common substring problem. Given the set of strings formula_7, where formula_8 and formula_9. Find for each formula_10, the longest strings which occur as substrings of at least formula_11 strings.\n\nOne can find the lengths and starting positions of the longest common substrings of formula_1 and formula_3 in formula_14 time with the help of a generalized suffix tree. Finding them by dynamic programming costs formula_15. The solutions to the generalized problem take formula_16 space and formula_17·...·formula_18 time with dynamic programming and take formula_19 time with generalized suffix tree.\n\nThe longest common substrings of a set of strings can be found by building a generalized suffix tree for the strings, and then finding the deepest internal nodes which have leaf nodes from all the strings in the subtree below it. The figure on the right is the suffix tree for the strings \"ABAB\", \"BABA\" and \"ABBA\", padded with unique string terminators, to become \"ABAB$0\", \"BABA$1\" and \"ABBA$2\". The nodes representing \"A\", \"B\", \"AB\" and \"BA\" all have descendant leaves from all of the strings, numbered 0, 1 and 2.\n\nBuilding the suffix tree takes formula_20 time (if the size of the alphabet is constant). If the tree is traversed from the bottom up with a bit vector telling which strings are seen below each node, the k-common substring problem can be solved in formula_21 time. If the suffix tree is prepared for constant time lowest common ancestor retrieval, it can be solved in formula_20 time.\n\nThe following pseudocode finds the set of longest common substrings between two strings with dynamic programming:\n\nThis algorithm runs in formula_23 time. The variable codice_1 is used to hold the length of the longest common substring found so far. The set codice_2 is used to hold the set of strings which are of length codice_1. The set codice_2 can be saved efficiently by just storing the index codice_5, which is the last character of the longest common substring (of size z) instead of codice_6. Thus all the longest common substrings would be, for each i in codice_2, codice_8.\n\nThe following tricks can be used to reduce the memory usage of an implementation:\n\n\n"}

Holmesburg was named for the descendants of Judge John Holme (1632–1704) who immigrated to Philadelphia in the 1680s and had no apparent relation to Surveyor General Thomas Holme. John Holme's descendants acquired land in Lower Dublin, north and south of Frankford Avenue and west of the Pennypack Creek. At the turn of the 19th century they began selling numerous small parcels of their holdings in what became a real estate boom. Also at this time, John Holme, the great grandson of the first John Holme, renamed his lumber yard the Holmesburg Lumber Yard. This renaming coupled with the multitude of Holme family real estate transactions identified this area as 'Holmesburg', the title surviving more than two hundred years later. \n\nIt is bordered to the west by Brous Ave. to Ryan Ave. to Sandy Run/Pennypack Creek to Holme Ave. to Holme Circle to Ashton Rd. to Willits Rd, the Delaware River to the east, and Sheffield Street to the south. The border shared with Torresdale to the north is Welsh/Willits/Academy Road and then over to Linden Ave. Holmesburg's zip code is 19136.\n\nThe area around Holmesburg was first inhabited by the Lenape. In 1683 William Penn purchased from the Indians the land between the Pennypack and Neshaminy Creeks. In November 1682, Thomas Holme received a grant from Penn of 1,646 acres on either side of Pennypack Creek to establish Wellspring Plantation. In 1790, his decedents divided the land, and this 26-acre section became known as the Village of Holmesburg.\n\nPenn had the King's Highway Bridge erected over the Pennypack Creek in 1697 to connect his mansion with the new city of Philadelphia. Downstream from the bridge Peter Dale and John Holme built a grist mill. A dam was constructed upstream at \"Rocky Falls\"; water to turn the mill-wheels was brought from the dam through a long mill-race. Welsh farmers from Gwynedd built a road to bring their grain to the mill. At the end of Welsh Road is Mill Street, which leads to where the mills once stood. When Robert Lewis came into ownership, he added a cooperage for the production of barrels and hogsheads, and this required construction of a sawmill, and probably a cider mill. A bit upstream from the sawmill, David Lewis built a textile mill which was burned during the War of 1812, but subsequently rebuilt. The mills contributed to the growth of Holmesburg.\n\nThe first stagecoach service was established in 1756 between Philadelphia and New York. As the trip took three days, this required rest stops. A a blacksmith shop and an inn were established where Welsh Road met the Kings Highway. The Green Tree opened in 1799. U.S. Route 13 between Philadelphia and Morrisville was known as the Frankford and Bristol Turnpike. Ferries had operated near the mouth of the Pennypack from early time. Ferry Lane, (now Pennypack Street) was built to access the Frankford-Bristol Road. In 1803 Holmesburg got its own toll-house and toll-gate, to cover maintenance. \n\nIn 1834 the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad opened. By 1862 a was established at Delaware Avenue (now Rhawn Street). In 1863, the Frankford and Holmesburg Railroad was incorporated to build a line from Frankford to Holmesburg. State Road was opened in 1870. In 1895, the Holmesburg, Tacony and Frankford Company established trolley service; and the road was renamed Frankford Avenue.\n\nHolmesburg native George A. Castor became a successful merchant tailor with large establishments in New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia. He built the eighteen bedroom mansion \"Stoneyhurst\" on Solly Avenue overlooking the Pennypack Creek. As of 2018, the site was occupied by the motherhouse of the sisters of the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, a Roman Catholic women's congregation, that relocated there in 1931. The congregation was founded by Vincentian Father Timothy A. Judge, for whom Father Judge High School is named.\n\nShakespearean actor Edwin Forrest purchased 100 acres of land along Frankford Avenue for a country estate. After his death in 1872, his executors turned it into the Forrest Home for retired actors. It operated from about 1876 to 1927. By 1905 lands along the Pennypack had been acquired for parkland. \n\nAround 1701, Lower Dublin Township was established. In 1853, about half the area of the township was separated out into Delaware Township, which comprised Torresdale and Holmesburg. It was superseded the following year by the 1854 Act of Consolidation, 1854 and incorporated into Philadelphia.\n\nCompleted in 1906, the Thomas Holme Library is the smallest of the Philadelphia branch libraries. It was built through an endowment from industrialist Andrew Carnegie. The funds for construction were contingent on the municipality providing the land. The lot was donated by the local Lower Dublin Academy through an endowment established by the Holme family for educational purposes. While originally providing for a school, a library was considered by the trustees and the community to be a significant educational contribution, a concept shared by the Carnegie Corporation. The Thomas Holme Branch was designed by architect Horace W. Castor, of the firm of Sterns & Castor, in the Beaux Arts style. The Free Library of Philadelphia operates the Holmesburg Branch. \n\n\nThe School District of Philadelphia operates Joseph H. Brown Elementary School in Holmesburg. The original Joseph H Brown Elementary School opened in 1895. Brown feeds into Meehan Middle School. All persons assigned to Meehan are zoned to Abraham Lincoln High School. Lincoln was originally scheduled to be named Mayfair High School, but opposition from other neighborhoods, including Holmesburg, meant that the school was instead named after Abraham Lincoln. In 1949 the school's cornerstone was laid.\n\nSaint Dominic Roman Catholic church and grade school are located in Holmesburg. Father Judge High School is also located in Holmesburg. It was established in 1954 by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia and is run by the Oblates of St. Francis de Sales.\n\nOther private or independent schools in Holmesburg, Philadelphia include Holmesburg Christian Academy, which is affiliated with Holmesburg Baptist Church and includes a preschool, elementary school, and middle school.\n\nHolmesburg Prison opened in 1896. The Philadelphia Prison System is located in Holmesburg. It includes the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility (named for Patrick N. Curran, Warden of old Holmesburg Prison, and Robert F. Fromhold, Deputy Warden, both of whom were murdered in an attack by two inmates on May 31, 1973), the Detention Center, the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center, the House of Correction, Riverside Correctional Facility and The Alternative and Special Detention unit. Curran-Fromhold replaced Holmesburg Prison, which was used from 1896 until 1995. Holmesburg Prison was recently reopened. \"\" is a 1998 book by Allen Hornblum, which documents clinical non-therapeutic medical experiments on prison inmates at Holmesburg Prison from 1951 to 1974. \n\nHolmesburg contains one of the longest continuous African-American communities in the nation, having been founded by runaway slaves prior to and during the Civil War.\n\nHolmesburg is the location of the historic Pennypack Theatre building, built in 1929 in the Art Deco style with a 1,364-seat capacity and designed by acclaimed 20th century theater architect William Harold Lee.\n\nThe Frankford Avenue Bridge and Joseph H.

Interstate 95 is also an easy 10-15 minute drive into downtown, accessible either by the Cottman Avenue (PA-73) entrance to the south or Academy Road entrance to the north.\n\nHolmesburg's main thoroughfare, Frankford Avenue (U.S. Route 13), is a historic byway in use for centuries. Frankford Avenue was used as a route from Philadelphia to points north as far back as the 17th century. The Frankford Avenue Bridge across Pennypack Creek, built in 1697, is the oldest stone arch bridge in continuous use in the country.\n\nHolmesburg Prison was used for three major motion pictures, \"Up Close & Personal\" starring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer, \"Animal Factory\" starring Willem Dafoe, Mickey Rourke, and Edward Furlong, and \"Law Abiding Citizen\" starring Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, and Colm Meany. Parts of the movie \"Fallen\" were also filmed here.\n\n"}

Although traditional shrimp farming has been carried out in Asia for centuries, large-scale commercial shrimp farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply, particularly to match the market demands of the United States, Japan and Western Europe. The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, representing a value of nearly 9 billion U.S. dollars. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico are the largest producers. The largest exporting nation is Thailand.\nShrimp farming has changed from traditional, small-scale businesses in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to growing shrimp at ever higher densities, and broodstock is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are of the family Penaeidae, and just two species – \"Penaeus vannamei\" (Pacific white shrimp) and \"Penaeus monodon\" (giant tiger prawn) – account for roughly 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial monocultures are very susceptible to diseases, which have caused several regional wipe-outs of farm shrimp populations. Increasing ecological problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both NGOs and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulation by governments. In 1999, a program aimed at developing and promoting more sustainable farming practices was initiated, including governmental bodies, industry representatives, and environmental organizations.\n\nShrimp has been farmed in South East Asia and China for centuries, using traditional low-density methods. In Indonesia, the use of brackish water ponds, called \"tambaks\", can be traced back as far as the 15th century. They used small scale ponds for monoculture or polycultured with other species, such as milkfish, or in rotation with rice, using the rice paddies for shrimp cultures during the dry season, when no rice could be grown. Such cultures often were in coastal areas or on river banks. Mangrove areas were favored because of their abundant natural shrimp. Wild juvenile shrimp were trapped in ponds and reared on naturally occurring organisms in the water until they reached the desired size for harvesting.\n\nIndustrial shrimp farming can be traced to the 1930s, when Japanese agrarians spawned and cultivated Kuruma shrimp (\"Penaeus japonicus\") for the first time. By the 1960s, a small industry had developed in Japan. Commercial shrimp farming began to grow rapidly in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Technological advances led to more intensive forms of farming, and growing market demand led to worldwide proliferation of shrimp farms, concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions. Growing consumer demand in the early 1980s coincided with faltering wild catches, creating a booming industry. Taiwan was an early adopter and a major producer in the 1980s; its production collapsed beginning in 1988 due to poor management practices and disease. In Thailand, large-scale production expanded rapidly from 1985. In South America, Ecuador pioneered shrimp farming, where it expanded dramatically from 1978. Brazil had been active in shrimp farming since 1974, but trade boomed there only in the 1990s, making the country a major producer within a few years. Today, there are marine shrimp farms in over fifty countries.\n\nWhen shrimp farming emerged to satisfy demand that had surpassed the wild fisheries' capacity, the subsistence farming methods of old were rapidly replaced by the more productive practices required to serve a global market. Industrial farming at first followed traditional methods, with so-called \"extensive\" farms, compensating for low density with increased pond sizes; instead of ponds of just a few hectares, ponds of sizes up to were used and huge areas of mangroves were cleared in some areas. Technological advances made more intensive practices possible that increase yield per area, helping reduce pressure to convert more land. Semi-intensive and intensive farms appeared, where the shrimp were reared on artificial feeds and ponds were actively managed. Although many extensive farms remain, new farms typically are of the semi-intensive kind.\n\nUntil the mid-1980s, most farms were stocked with young wild animals, called 'postlarvae', typically caught locally. Postlarvae fishing became an important economic sector in many countries. To counteract the depletion of fishing grounds and to ensure a steady supply of young shrimp, the industry started breeding shrimp in hatcheries.\n\nShrimp mature and breed only in a marine habitat. The females lay 100,000 to 500,000 eggs, which hatch after some 24 hours into tiny nauplii. These nauplii feed on yolk reserves within their bodies, and then metamorphose into zoeae. Shrimp in this second larval stage feed in the wild on algae, and after a few days, morph again into mysis larvae. The mysis larvae or myses look akin to tiny shrimp, and feed on algae and zooplankton. After another three to four days, they metamorphose a final time into postlarvae: young shrimp that have adult characteristics. The whole process takes about 12 days from hatching. In the wild, postlarvae then migrate into estuaries, which are rich in nutrients and low in salinity. They migrate back into open waters when they mature.\n\nIn shrimp farming, this life cycle occurs under controlled conditions. The reasons to do so include more intensive farming, improved size control resulting in more uniformly sized shrimp, and better predator control, but also the ability to accelerate growth and maturation by controlling the climate (especially in farms in the temperate zones, using greenhouses). There are three different stages:\n\nMost farms produce one to two harvests a year; in tropical climates, even three are possible. Because of the need for salt water, shrimp farms are located on or near a coast. Inland shrimp farms have also been tried in some regions, but the need to ship salt water and competition for land with agricultural users led to problems. Thailand banned inland shrimp farms in 1999.\n\nSmall-scale hatcheries are very common throughout Southeast Asia. Often run as family businesses and using a low-technology approach, they use small tanks (less than ten tons) and often low animal densities. They are susceptible to disease, but due to their small size, they can typically restart production quickly after disinfection. The survival rate is anywhere between zero and 90%, depending on a wide range of factors, including disease, the weather, and the experience of the operator.\n\n\"Greenwater\" hatcheries are medium-sized hatcheries using large tanks with low animal densities. To feed the shrimp larvae, an algal bloom is induced in the tanks. The survival rate is about 40%.\n\n\"Galveston\" hatcheries (named after Galveston, Texas, where they were developed) are large-scale, industrial hatcheries using a closed and tightly controlled environment. They breed the shrimp at high densities in large (15–30 t) tanks. Survival rates vary between 0% and 80%, but typically achieve 50%.\n\nIn hatcheries, the developing shrimp are fed on a diet of algae and later also brine shrimp nauplii, sometimes (especially in industrial hatcheries) augmented by artificial diets. The diet of later stages also includes fresh or freeze-dried animal protein, for example krill. Nutrition and medication (such as antibiotics) fed to the brine shrimp nauplii are passed on to the shrimp that eat them.\n\nMany farms have nurseries where the postlarval shrimp are grown into juveniles for another three weeks in separate ponds, tanks, or so-called raceways. A raceway is a rectangular, long, shallow tank through which water flows continuously.\n\nIn a typical nursery, there are 150 to 200 animals per square metre. They are fed on a high-protein diet for at most three weeks before they are moved to the grow-out ponds. At that time, they weigh between one and two grams. The water salinity is adjusted gradually to that of the grow-out ponds.\n\nFarmers refer to postlarvae as \"PLs\", with the number of days suffixed (i.e., PL-1, PL-2, etc.). They are ready to be transferred to the grow-out ponds after their gills have branched, which occurs around PL-13 to PL-17 (about 25 days after hatching). Nursing is not absolutely necessary, but is favoured by many farms because it makes for better food utilization, improves the size uniformity, helps use the infrastructure better, and can be done in a controlled environment to increase the harvest. The main disadvantage of nurseries is that some of the postlarval shrimp die upon the transfer to the grow-out pond.\n\nSome farms do not use a nursery, but stock the postlarvae directly in the grow-out ponds after having acclimated them to the appropriate temperature and salinity levels in an acclimation tank. Over the course of a few days, the water in these tanks is changed gradually to match that of the grow-out ponds. The animal density should not exceed 500/litre for young postlarvae and 50/liter for larger ones, such as PL-15.\n\nIn the grow-out phase, the shrimp are grown to maturity. The postlarvae are transferred to ponds where they are fed until they reach marketable size, which takes about another three to six months. Harvesting the shrimp is done by fishing them from the ponds using nets or by draining the ponds. Pond sizes and the level of technical infrastructure vary.\n\nExtensive shrimp farms using traditional low-density methods are invariably located on a coast and often in mangrove areas. The ponds range from just a few to more than 100 hectares; shrimp are stocked at low densities (2–3 animals per square metre, or 25,000/ha). The tides provide for some water exchange, and the shrimp feed on naturally occurring organisms. In some areas, farmers even grow wild shrimp by just opening the gates and impounding wild larvae. Prevalent in poorer or less developed countries where land prices are low, extensive farms produce annual yields from 50 to 500 kg/ha of shrimp (head-on weight). They have low production costs (US$1–3/kg live shrimp), are not very labor-intensive, and do not require advanced technical skills.\n\nSemi-intensive farms do not rely on tides for water exchange, but use pumps and a planned pond layout. They can therefore be built above the high tide line. Pond sizes range from 2 to 30 ha; the stocking densities range from 10 to 30/square meter (100,000–300,000/ha). At such densities, artificial feeding using industrially prepared shrimp feeds and fertilizing the pond to stimulate the growth of naturally occurring organisms become a necessity. Annual yields range from 500 to 5,000 kg/ha, while production costs are in the range of US$2–6/kg live shrimp. With densities above 15 animals per square meter, aeration is often required to prevent oxygen depletion. Productivity varies depending upon water temperature, thus it is common to have larger sized shrimp in some seasons than in others.\n\nIntensive farms use even smaller ponds () and even higher stocking densities. The ponds are actively managed: they are aerated, there is a high water exchange to remove waste products and maintain water quality, and the shrimp are fed on specially designed diets, typically in the form of formulated pellets. Such farms produce annual yields between 5,000 and 20,000 kg/ha; a few super-intensive farms can produce as much as 100,000 kg/ha. They require an advanced technical infrastructure and highly trained professionals for constant monitoring of water quality and other pond conditions; their production costs are in the range of US$4–8/kg live shrimp.\n\nEstimates on the production characteristics of shrimp farms vary. Most studies agree that about 15-20% of all shrimp farms worldwide are extensive farms, another 25–30% are semi-intensive, and the rest are intensive farms. Regional variation is high, though, and Tacon reports wide discrepancies in the percentages claimed for individual countries by different studies.\n\nEyestalk ablation is the removal of one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) eyestalks from a crustacean. It is routinely practiced on female shrimps (or prawns) in almost every marine shrimp maturation or reproduction facility in the world, both research and commercial. The aim of ablation under these circumstances is to stimulate the female shrimp to develop mature ovaries and spawn.\n\nMost captive conditions for shrimp cause inhibitions in females that prevent them from developing mature ovaries. Even in conditions where a given species will develop ovaries and spawn in captivity, use of eyestalk ablation increases total egg production and increases the percentage of females in a given population that will participate in reproduction. Once females have been subjected to eyestalk ablation, complete ovarian development often ensues within as little as 3 to 10 days.\n\nWhile extensive farms mainly rely on the natural productivity of the ponds, more intensively managed farms rely on artificial shrimp feeds, either exclusively or as a supplement to the organisms that naturally occur in a pond. A food chain is established in the ponds, based on the growth of phytoplankton. Fertilizers and mineral conditioners are used to boost the growth of the phytoplankton to accelerate the growth of the shrimp. Waste from the artificial food pellets and shrimp excrement can lead to the eutrophication of the ponds.\n\nArtificial feeds come in the form of specially formulated, granulated pellets that disintegrate quickly. Up to 70% of such pellets are wasted, as they decay before the shrimp have eaten them. They are fed two to five times daily; the feeding can be done manually either from ashore or from boats, or using mechanized feeders distributed all over a pond. The feed conversion rate (FCR), i.e. the amount of food needed to produce a unit (e.g. one kilogram) of shrimp, is claimed by the industry to be around 1.2–2.0 in modern farms, but this is an optimum value that is not always attained in practice. For a farm to be profitable, a feed conversion rate below 2.5 is necessary; in older farms or under suboptimal pond conditions, the ratio may easily rise to 4:1. Lower FCRs result in a higher profit for the farm.\n\nAlthough there are many species of shrimp and prawn, only a few of the larger ones are actually cultivated, all of which belong to the family of penaeids (family Penaeidae), and within it to the genus \"Penaeus\". Many species are unsuitable for farming: they are too small to be profitable, or simply stop growing when crowded together, or are too susceptible to diseases. The two species dominating the market are:\n\n\nTogether, these two species account for about 80% of the whole farmed shrimp production. Other species being bred are:\n\nSeveral other species of \"Penaeus\" play only a very minor role in shrimp farming. Some other kinds of shrimp also can be farmed, e.g. the \"Akiami paste shrimp\" or \"Metapenaeus\" spp. Their total production from aquaculture is of the order of only about 25,000 tonnes per year, small in comparison to that of the penaeids.\n\nThere are a variety of lethal viral diseases that affect shrimp. In the densely populated, monocultural farms such virus infections spread rapidly and may wipe out whole shrimp populations. A major transfer vector of many of these viruses is the water itself; and thus any virus outbreak also carries the danger of decimating shrimp living in the wild.\n\nYellowhead disease, called \"Hua leung\" in Thai, affects \"P. monodon\" throughout Southeast Asia. It had been reported first in Thailand in 1990. The disease is highly contagious and leads to mass mortality within 2 to 4 days. The cephalothorax of an infected shrimp turns yellow after a period of unusually high feeding activity ending abruptly, and the then moribund shrimp congregate near the surface of their pond before dying.\n\nEarly mortality syndrome (EMS) has been linked to a strain of a bacterium called \"Vibrio parahaemolyticus\" which affects the Giant Tiger Prawn and the Whiteleg Shrimp, both shrimp that are commonly farmed around the world. The strains are not harmful to humans, but are economically devastating for shrimp farmers. The spread of the bacteria is more prevalent in warmer and saltier ocean waters.\n\nWhitespot syndrome is a disease caused by a family of related viruses. First reported in 1993 from Japanese \"P. japonicus\" cultures, it spread throughout Asia and then to the Americas. It has a wide host range and is highly lethal, leading to mortality rates of 100% within days. Symptoms include white spots on the carapace and a red hepatopancreas. Infected shrimp become lethargic before they die.\n\nTaura syndrome was first reported from shrimp farms on the Taura river in Ecuador in 1992. The host of the virus causing the disease is \"P. vannamei\", one of the two most commonly farmed shrimp. The disease spread rapidly, mainly through the shipping of infected animals and broodstock. Originally confined to farms in the Americas, it has also been propagated to Asian shrimp farms with the introduction of \"L. vannamei\" there. Birds are thought to be a route of infection between farms within one region.\n\nInfectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis (IHHN) is a disease that causes mass mortality among \"P. stylirostris\" (as high as 90%) and severe deformations in \"L. vannamei\". It occurs in Pacific farmed and wild shrimp, but not in wild shrimp on the Atlantic coast of the Americas.\n\nThere are also a number of bacterial infections that are lethal to shrimp. The most common is vibriosis, caused by bacteria of the \"Vibrio\" species. The shrimp become weak and disoriented, and may have dark wounds on the cuticle. The mortality rate can exceed 70%. Another bacterial disease is necrotising hepatopancreatitis (NHP); symptoms include a soft exoskeleton and fouling. Most such bacterial infections are strongly correlated to stressful conditions, such as overcrowded ponds, high temperatures, and poor water quality, factors that positively influence the growth of bacteria. Treatment is done using antibiotics. Importing countries have repeatedly placed import bans on shrimp containing various antibiotics. One such antibiotic is chloramphenicol, which has been banned in the European Union since 1994, but continues to pose problems.\n\nWith their high mortality rates, diseases represent a very real danger to shrimp farmers, who may lose their income for the whole year if their ponds are infected. Since most diseases cannot yet be treated effectively, the industry's efforts are focused on preventing disease outbreak in the first place. Active water quality management helps avoid poor pond conditions favorable to the spread of diseases, and instead of using larvae from wild catches, specific pathogen free broodstocks raised in captivity in isolated environments and certified not to carry diseases are used increasingly. To avoid introducing diseases into such disease-free populations on a farm, there is also a trend to create more controlled environments in the ponds of semi-intensive farms, such as by lining them with plastic to avoid soil contact, and by minimizing water exchange in the ponds.\n\nThe total global production of farmed shrimp reached 2.5 million tonnes in 2005. This accounts for 42% of the total shrimp production that year (farming and wild catches combined). The largest single market for shrimp is the United States, importing between 500 – 600,000 tonnes of shrimp products yearly in the years 2003–2009. About 200,000 tonnes yearly are imported by Japan, while the European Union imported in 2006 another about 500,000 tonnes of tropical shrimps, with the largest importers being Spain and France. The EU also is a major importer of coldwater shrimp from catches, mainly common shrimp \"(Crangon crangon)\" and \"Pandalidae\" such as \"Pandalus borealis\"; in 2006, these imports accounted for about another 200,000 tonnes.\n\nThe import prices for shrimp fluctuate wildly. In 2003, the import price per kilogram shrimp in the United States was US$8.80, slightly higher than in Japan at US$8.00. The average import price in the EU was only about US$5.00/kg; this much lower value is explained by the fact that the EU imports more coldwater shrimp (from catches) that are much smaller than the farmed warm water species, and thus attain lower prices. In addition, Mediterranean Europe prefers head-on shrimp, which weigh approximately 30% more, but have a lower unit price.\n\nAbout 75% of the world production of farmed shrimp comes from Asian countries; the two leading nations being China and Thailand, closely followed by Vietnam, Indonesia, and India. The other 25% are produced in the western hemisphere, where Latin American countries (Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico) dominate. In terms of export, Thailand is by far the leading nation, with a market share of more than 30%, followed by China, Indonesia, and India, accounting each for about 10%. Other major export nations are Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Ecuador. Thailand exports nearly all of its production, while China uses most of its shrimp in the domestic market. The only other major export nation that has a strong domestic market for farmed shrimp is Mexico.\n\nDisease problems have repeatedly impacted the shrimp production negatively. Besides the near-wipeout of \"P. chinensis\" in 1993, there were outbreaks of viral diseases that led to marked declines in the per-country production in 1996/97 in Thailand and repeatedly in Ecuador. In Ecuador alone, production suffered heavily in 1989 (IHHN), 1993 (Taura), and 1999 (whitespot). Another reason for sometimes wild changes in shrimp farm output are the import regulations of the destination countries, which do not allow shrimp contaminated by chemicals or antibiotics to be imported.\n\nIn the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, shrimp farming promised high profits. The investments required for extensive farms were low, especially in regions with low land prices and wages. For many tropical countries, especially those with poorer economies, shrimp farming was an attractive business, offering jobs and incomes for poor coastal populations and has, due to the high market prices of shrimp, provided many developing countries with non-negligible foreign currency earnings. Many shrimp farms were funded initially by the World Bank or substantially subsidized by local governments.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the economic situation changed. Governments and farmers alike were under increasing pressure from NGOs and the consumer countries, who criticized the practices of the trade. International trade conflicts erupted, such as import bans by consumer countries on shrimp containing antibiotics, the United States' shrimp import ban against Thailand in 2004 as a measure against Thai shrimp \"fishers\" not using turtle excluder devices in their nets, or the \"anti-dumping\" case initiated by U.S. shrimp fishers in 2002 against shrimp farmers worldwide, which resulted two years later in the U.S. imposing antidumping tariffs of the order of about 10% against many producer countries (except China, which received a 112% duty). Diseases caused significant economic losses. In Ecuador, where shrimp farming was a major export sector (the other two are bananas and oil), the whitespot outbreak of 1999 caused an estimated 130,000 workers to lose their jobs. Furthermore, shrimp prices dropped sharply in 2000. All of these factors contributed to the slowly growing acceptance by farmers that improved farming practices were needed, and resulted in tighter government regulation of the business, both of which internalized some of the external costs that were ignored during the boom years.\n\nShrimp farming offers significant employment opportunities, which may help alleviate the poverty of the local coastal populations in many areas, if it is properly managed. The published literature on that topic shows large discrepancies, and much of the available data are of anecdotal nature. Estimates of the labor intensity of shrimp farms range from about one-third to three times more than when the same area was used for rice paddies, with much regional variation and depending on the type of farms surveyed. In general, intensive shrimp farming requires more labor per unit area than extensive farming. Extensive shrimp farms cover much more land area and are often, but not always, located in areas where no agricultural land uses are possible. Supporting industries such as feed production or storage, handling, and trade companies should also not be neglected, even if not all of them are exclusive to shrimp farming.\n\nTypically, workers on a shrimp farm can get better wages than with other employment. A global estimate from one study is that a shrimp farm worker can earn 1.5–3 times as much as in other jobs; a study from India arrived at a salary increase of about 1.6, and a report from Mexico states the lowest paid job at shrimp farms was paid in 1996 at 1.22 times the average worker salary in the country.\n\nNGOs have frequently criticized that most of the profits went to large conglomerates instead of to the local population. While this may be true in certain regions, such as Ecuador, where most shrimp farms are owned by large companies, it does not apply in all cases. For instance in Thailand, most farms are owned by small local entrepreneurs, although there is a trend to vertically integrate the industries related to shrimp farming from feed producers to food processors and trade companies. A 1994 study reported a farmer in Thailand could increase their income by a factor of ten by switching from growing rice to farming shrimp. An Indian study from 2003 arrives at similar figures for shrimp farming in the East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nWhether the local population benefits from shrimp farming is also dependent on the availability of sufficiently trained people. Extensive farms tend to offer mainly seasonal jobs during harvest that do not require much training. In Ecuador, many of these positions are known to have been filled by migrant workers. More intensive farms have a need for year-round labor in more sophisticated jobs.\n\nFor commercialization, shrimp are graded and marketed in different categories. From complete shrimp (known as \"head-on, shell-on\" or HOSO) to peeled and deveined (P&D), any presentation is available in stores. The animals are graded by their size uniformity and then also by their count per weight unit, with larger shrimp attaining higher prices.\n\nShrimp farms of all types, from extensive to super-intensive, can cause severe ecological problems wherever they are located. For extensive farms, huge areas of mangroves were cleared, reducing biodiversity. During the 1980s and 1990s, about 35% of the world's mangrove forests had vanished. Shrimp farming was a major cause of this, accounting for over a third of it according to one study; other studies report between 5% and 10% globally, with enormous regional variability. Other causes of mangrove destruction are population pressure, logging, pollution from other industries, or conversion to other uses such as salt pans. Mangroves, through their roots, help stabilize a coastline and capture sediments; their removal has led to a marked increase of erosion and less protection against floods. Mangrove estuaries are also especially rich and productive ecosystems and provide the spawning grounds for many species of fish, including many commercially important ones. Many countries have protected their mangroves and forbidden the construction of new shrimp farms in tidal or mangrove areas. The enforcement of the respective laws is often problematic, though, and especially in the least developed countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, or Vietnam the conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms remains an issue for areas such as the Myanmar Coast mangroves.\n\nIntensive farms, while reducing the direct impact on the mangroves, have other problems. Their nutrient-rich effluents (industrial shrimp feeds disintegrate quickly, as little as 30% are actually eaten by the shrimp with a corresponding economic loss to the farmer, the rest is wasted) are typically discharged into the environment, seriously upsetting the ecological balance. These waste waters contain significant amounts of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and antibiotics that cause pollution of the environment. Furthermore, releasing antibiotics in such ways injects them into the food chain and increases the risks of bacteria becoming resistant against them. However, most aquatic bacteria, unlike bacteria associated with terrestrial animals, are not zoonotic. Only a few disease transfers from animals to humans have been reported.\n\nProlonged use of a pond can lead to an incremental buildup of a sludge at the pond's bottom from waste products and excrement. The sludge can be removed mechanically, or dried and plowed to allow biodecomposition, at least in areas without acid problems. Flushing a pond never completely removes this sludge, and eventually, the pond is abandoned, leaving behind a wasteland, with the soil made unusable for any other purposes due to the high levels of salinity, acidity, and toxic chemicals. A typical pond in an extensive farm can be used only a few years. An Indian study estimated the time to rehabilitate such lands to about 30 years. Thailand has banned inland shrimp farms since 1999 because they caused too much destruction of agricultural lands due to salination. A Thai study estimated 60% of the shrimp farming area in Thailand was abandoned in the years 1989–1996. Many of these problems stem from using mangrove land that has high natural pyrite content (acid sulfate soil) and poor drainage. The shift to semi-intensive farming requires higher elevations for drain harvesting and low sulfide (pyrite) content to prevent acid formation when the soils shift from anaerobic to aerobic conditions.\n\nThe global nature of the shrimp farming business, and in particular the shipment of broodstock and hatchery products, throughout the world have not only introduced various shrimp species as exotic species, but also distributed the diseases the shrimp may carry worldwide. As a consequence, most broodstock shipments require health certificates and/or to have specific pathogen free (SPF) status. Many organizations lobby actively for consumers to avoid buying farmed shrimp; some also advocate the development of more sustainable farming methods. A joint programme of the World Bank, the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA), the WWF, and the FAO was established in August 1999 to study and propose improved practices for shrimp farming. Some existing attempts at sustainable export-oriented shrimp farming marketing the shrimp as \"ecologically produced\" are criticized by NGOs as being dishonest and trivial window-dressing.\n\nYet, the industry has been slowly changing since about 1999. It has adopted the \"best management practices\" developed by the World Bank program, for example, and others. and instituted educational programs to promote them. Due to the mangrove protection laws enacted in many countries, new farms are usually of the semi-intensive kind, which are best constructed outside mangrove areas anyway. There is a trend to create even more tightly controlled environments in these farms, with the hope to achieve better disease prevention. Waste water treatment has attracted considerable attention; modern shrimp farms routinely have effluent treatment ponds where sediments are allowed to settle at the bottom and other residuals are filtered. As such improvements are costly, the World Bank program also recommends low-intensity polyculture farming for some areas. Since it has been discovered that mangrove soils are effective in filtering waste waters and tolerate high nitrate levels, the industry has also developed an interest in mangrove reforestation, although its contributions in that area are still minor. The long-term effects of these recommendations and industry trends cannot be evaluated conclusively yet.\n\nStill, it was reported in 2012 that one pound of frozen shrimp adds one ton of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, more than ten times that generated to produce the same weight of beef raised on cleared rainforest land.\n\nShrimp farming in many cases has far-reaching effects on the local coastal population. Especially in the boom years of the 1980s and 1990s, when the business was largely unregulated in many countries, the very fast expansion of the industry caused significant changes that sometimes were detrimental to the local population. Conflicts can be traced back to two root causes: competition for common resources such as land and water, and changes induced by wealth redistribution.\n\nA significant problem causing much conflict in some regions, for instance in Bangladesh, are the land use rights. With shrimp farming, a new industry expanded into coastal areas and started to make exclusive use of previously public resources. In some areas, the rapid expansion resulted in the local coastal population being denied access to the coast by a continuous strip of shrimp farms with serious impacts on the local fisheries. Such problems were compounded by poor ecological practices that caused a degradation of common resources (such as excessive use of freshwater to control the salinity of the ponds, causing the water table to sink and leading to the salination of freshwater aquifers by an inflow of salt water). With growing experience, countries usually introduced stronger governmental regulations and have taken steps to mitigate such problems, for instance through land zoning legislations. Some late adopters have even managed to avoid some problems through proactive legislation, e.g. Mexico. The situation in Mexico is unique owing to the strongly government-regulated market. Even after the liberalisation in the early 1990s, most shrimp farms are still owned and controlled by locals or local co-ops (\"\").\n\nSocial tensions have occurred due to changes in the wealth distribution within populations. The effects of this are mixed, though, and the problems are not unique to shrimp farming. Changes in the distribution of wealth tend to induce changes in the power structure within a community. In some cases, there is a widening gap between the general population and local elites who have easier access to credits, subsidies, and permits and thus are more likely to become shrimp farmers and benefit more. In Bangladesh, on the other hand, local elites were opposing shrimp farming, which was controlled largely by an urban elite. Land concentrations in a few hands has been recognized to carry an increased risk of social and economic problems developing, especially if the landowners are non-local.\n\nIn general, it has been found that shrimp farming is accepted best and introduced most easily and with the greatest benefits for the local communities if the farms are owned by local people instead of by restricted remote élites or large companies because local owners have a direct interest in maintaining the environment and good relations with their neighbors, and because it avoids the formation of large-scale land property.\n\nAlthough shrimp farming has disrupted social structures, it is possible for both commercial industries and independent farmers to succeed. Closed system shrimp aquaculture for instance, is becoming widely used in the US and is making its way to Southeast Asia. This system takes place indoors in moderate sized pools which efficiently circulates the water. In some cases filter feeders such as shellfish and other fish are introduced in the system, feeding off nutrients in the water that would otherwise be cycled out. This option is more environmentally safe than large scale intensive farming practices. Unfortunately, this system is capital intensive and would be difficult for small scale, independent shrimp farmers to acquire. However, this would be an excellent alternative for larger shrimp industries in Thailand.\nAnother alternative would be to revert to traditional shrimp farming practices, without overstocking and the use of harmful chemicals. This would be an ideal option for small scale shrimp farmers supplying for their own community as well as creating an independent food source.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2167409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167409", "title": "Freshwater prawn farming", "text": "Freshwater prawn farming\n\nA freshwater prawn farm is an aquaculture business designed to raise and produce freshwater prawns or shrimp for human consumption. Freshwater prawn farming shares many characteristics with, and many of the same problems as, marine shrimp farming. Unique problems are introduced by the developmental life cycle of the main species (the giant river prawn, \"Macrobrachium rosenbergii\").\n\nThe global annual production of freshwater prawns (excluding crayfish and crabs) in 2003 was about 280,000 tons, of which China produced some 180,000 tons, followed by India and Thailand with some 35,000 tons each. Additionally, China produced about 370,000 tons of Chinese river crab (\"Eriocheir sinensis\").\n\nAll farmed freshwater prawns today belong to the genus \"Macrobrachium\". Until 2000, the only species farmed was the giant river prawn (\"Macrobrachium rosenbergii\", also known as the Malaysian prawn). Since then, China has begun farming the Oriental river prawn (\"M. nipponense\") in large quantities, and India farms a small amount of monsoon river prawn (\"M. malcolmsonii\"). In 2003, these three species accounted for all farmed freshwater prawns, about two-thirds \"M. rosenbergii\" and one-third \"M. nipponense\".\n\nAbout 200 species in the genus \"Macrobrachium\" live in the tropical and subtropical climates on all continents except Europe and Antarctica.\n\nGiant river prawns live in turbid freshwater, but their larval stages require brackish water to survive.\nMales can reach a body size of 32 cm; females grow to 25 cm. In mating, the male deposits spermatophores on the underside of the female's thorax, between the walking legs. The female then extrudes eggs, which pass through the spermatophores. The female carries the fertilized eggs with her until they hatch; the time may vary, but is generally less than three weeks. A large female may lay up to 100,000 eggs. \n\nFrom these eggs hatch zoeae, the first larval stage of crustaceans. They go through several larval stages before metamorphosing into postlarvae, at which stage they are about 8 mm long and have all the characteristics of adults. This metamorphosis usually takes place about 32 to 35 days after hatching. These postlarvae then migrate back into freshwater.\n\nThere are three different morphotypes of males. The first stage is called \"small male\" (SM); this smallest stage has short, nearly translucent claws. If conditions allow, small males grow and metamorphose into \"orange claw\" (OC) males, which have large orange claws on their second chelipeds, which may have a length of 0.8 to 1.4 times their body size. OC males later may transform into the third and final stage, the \"blue claw\" (BC) males. These have blue claws, and their second chelipeds may become twice as long as their body.\n\nMale \"M. rosenbergii\" prawns have a strict hierarchy: the territorial BC males dominate the OCs, which in turn dominate the SMs. The presence of BC males inhibits the growth of SMs and delays the metamorphosis of OCs into BCs; an OC will keep growing until it is larger than the largest BC male in its neighbourhood before transforming. All three male stages are sexually active, though, and females which have undergone their premating molt will cooperate with any male to reproduce. BC males protect the females until their shells have hardened; OCs and SMs show no such behavior.\n\nGiant river prawns have been farmed using traditional methods in Southeast Asia for a long time. First experiments with artificial breeding cultures of \"M. rosenbergii\" were done in the early 1960s in Malaysia, where it was discovered that the larvae needed brackish water for survival. Industrial-scale rearing processes were perfected in the early 1970s in Hawaii, and spread first to Taiwan and Thailand, and then to other countries.\n\nThe technologies used in freshwater prawn farming are basically the same as in marine shrimp farming. Hatcheries produce postlarvae, which then are grown and acclimated in nurseries before being transferred into growout ponds, where the prawns are then fed and grown until they reach marketable size. Harvesting is done by either draining the pond and collecting the animals (\"batch\" harvesting) or by fishing the prawns out of the pond using nets (continuous operation).\n\nDue to the aggressive nature of \"M. rosenbergii\" and the hierarchy between males, stocking densities are much lower than in penaeid shrimp farms. Intensive farming is not possible due to the increased level of cannibalism, so all farms are either stocked semi-intensively (4 to 20 postlarvae per square metre) or, in extensive farms, at even lower densities (1 to 4/m²). The management of the growout ponds must take into account the growth characteristics of \"M. rosenbergii\": the presence of blue-claw males inhibits the growth of small males, and delays the metamorphosis of OC males into BCs. Some farms fish off the largest prawns from the pond using seines to ensure a healthy composition of the pond's population, designed to optimize the yield, even if they employ batch harvesting. The heterogeneous individual growth of \"M. rosenbergii\" makes growth control necessary even if a pond is stocked newly, starting from scratch: some animals will grow faster than others and become dominant BCs, stunting the growth of other individuals.\n\nThe FAO considers the ecological impact of freshwater prawn farming to be less severe than in shrimp farming. The prawns are cultured at much lower densities, meaning less concentrated waste products and a lesser danger of the ponds becoming breeding places for diseases. The growout ponds do not salinate agricultural land, as do those of inland marine shrimp farms. However, the lower yield per area means that the income per Ha is also lower and a given area can support fewer humans. This limits the culture area to low value lands where intensification is not required. Freshwater prawn farms do not endanger mangroves, and are better amenable to small-scale businesses run by a family. However, like marine farmed shrimp, \"M. rosenbergii\" is also susceptible to a variety of viral or bacterial diseases, including white tail disease, also called \"white muscle disease\".\n\nThe global annual production of freshwater prawns in 2003 was about 280,000 tonnes, of which China produced some 180,000 tonnes, followed by India and Thailand with some 35,000 tonnes each. Other major producer countries are Taiwan, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. In the United States, only a few hundred small farms for \"M. rosenbergii\" produced about 50 tonnes in 2003.This made been more demand for the foreign culture but not for Indian.It was a big export trade in India from major producer countries.\n\nThe main reference for this article was a comprehensive farming manual \"Farming freshwater prawns\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2167410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167410", "title": "White spot syndrome", "text": "White spot syndrome\n\nWhite spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the lone virus (and type species) of the genus Whispovirus (white spot), which is the only genus in the family Nimaviridae. It is responsible for causing white spot syndrome in a wide range of crustacean hosts. White spot syndrome (WSS) is a viral infection of penaeid shrimp. The disease is highly lethal and contagious, killing shrimp quickly. Outbreaks of this disease have wiped out the entire populations of many shrimp farms within a few days, in places throughout the world.\n\nThe disease is caused by a family of related viruses subsumed as the whitespot syndrome baculovirus complex  and the disease caused by them as white spot syndrome (WSS).\n\nThe first reported epidemic due to this virus is from Taiwan in 1992. Reports of losses due to white spot disease came from China in 1993 where it led to a virtual collapse of the shrimp farming industry. This was followed by outbreaks in Japan and Korea in the same year, Thailand, India and Malaysia in 1994, and by 1996 it had severely affected East Asia and South Asia. In late 1995, it was reported in the United States, 1998 in Central and South America, 1999 in Mexico' in 2000 in the Philippines, and in 2011 in Saudi Arabia. The virus was detected in Queensland, Australia in November 2016. Australia was believed to be the last shrimp-growing region free from the virus.\n\nWhite spot syndrome virus is a species of virus in the genus \"Whispovirus\", in the family\" Nimaviridae\". It is the only species in this family, so serves as the type species.\nWhite spot syndrome virus is a dsDNA virus, which places it in group I of the Baltimore classification system.\n\nGroup: dsDNA\nWSSV is a rod-shaped, double-stranded, DNA virus, and the size of the enveloped viral particles have been reported to be 240–380 nm long and 70–159 nm in diameter and nucleocapsid core is 120–205 nm long and 95–165 nm in diameter. The virus has an outer lipid bilayer membrane envelope, sometimes with a tail-like appendage at one end of the virion. The nucleocapsid consists of 15 conspicuous vertical helices located along the long axis; each helix has two parallel striations, composed of 14 globular capsomers, each of which is 8 nm in diameter.\nThe complete DNA sequence of the WSSV genome has been assembled into a circular sequence of 292,967 bp. It encodes 531 putative open reading frames.\n\nOne of the proteins, WSSV449, has some similarity to host protein Tube and can function like Tube by activating the NF-κB pathway.\n\nViral replication is nuclear; DNA-templated transcription is its method. The virus infects an unusually wide host range of crustaceans. Transmission of the virus is mainly through oral ingestion and water-borne routes in farms (horizontal transmission) and vertical transmission (from infected mother prawns) in the case of shrimp hatcheries. The virus is present in the wild stocks of shrimp, especially in the coastal waters adjacent to shrimp-farming regions in Asian countries, but mass mortalities of wild shrimp are yet to be observed.\nThe virus has a wide host range. While shrimp can survive with the virus for extended periods of time, factors such as stress can cause the outbreak of WSS. The disease is highly virulent and leads to mortality rates of 100% within days in the case of cultured penaeid shrimps. Most of the cultured penaeid shrimps (\"Penaeus monodon\", \"Marsupenaeus japonicus\", \"Litopenaeus vannamei\", and \"Fenneropenaeus indicus\") are natural hosts of the virus. Several nonpenaeid shrimp were also found to be severely infected during experimental challenges. Many crustaceans such as crabs (\"Scylla\" spp., \"Portunus\" spp.), spiny lobsters (\"Panulirus\" spp.), crayfish (\"Astacus\" spp.', \"Cherax\" spp.) and freshwater shrimp (\"Macrobrachium\" spp.) are reported to be infected with variable severities depending on the lifestage of the host and presence of external stressors (temperature, salinity, bacterial diseases, pollutants).\n\nClinical signs of WSS include a sudden reduction in food consumption, lethargy, loose cuticle and often reddish discolouration, and the presence of white spots of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter on the inside surface of the carapace, appendages, and cuticle over the abdominal segments.\n\nIn the host, WSSV infects a wide variety of cells from ectodermal and mesodermal origin. Histological changes are seen in the gill epithelium, antennal gland, haematopoeitic tissue, nervous tissue, connective tissue, and intestinal epithelial tissue. Infected cells have prominent intranuclear occlusions that initially stain eosinophilic, but become basophilic with age; hypertrophied nuclei with chromatin margination; and cytoplasmic clearing. Pathogenesis involves widespread tissue necrosis and disintegration.\n\nWhite spots on the shell of infected shrimp under scanning electron microscope appear as large, dome-shaped spots on the carapace measuring 0.3 to 3.0 mm in diameter. Smaller white spots of 0.02 to 0.10 mm appear as linked spheres on the cuticle surface. Chemical composition of the spots is similar to the carapace, calcium forming 80–90% of the total material, and may have derived from abnormalities of the cuticular epidermis.\n\nSeveral biochemical changes have been reported after infection with this virus: glucose consumption and plasma lactate concentration increase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase activity increases, and triglyceride concentration decreases. The voltage-dependent anion channel of the mitochondrion is also upregulated.\n\nInfection with WSSV differs from other described penaeid infections yellowhead virus (YHV) and infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) in the described histological findings, as YHV has a reduced tissue specificity, infecting only the intestinal epithelial tissues and IHHNV causes intranuclear occlusions that stain eosinophilic, but do not change over the course of the infection.\n\nRapid and specific diagnosis of the virus can be accomplished using nested or quantitative PCR.\n\nNo treatments for WSS are available.\n\nA large number of disinfectants are widely used in shrimp farms and hatcheries to prevent an outbreak. Stocking of uninfected shrimp seeds and rearing them away from environmental stressors with extreme care to prevent contamination are useful management measures. Site selection may be one of the most crucial in preventing WSS. Shrimp farmed in areas with relatively low temperature fluctuations and at water temperatures greater than 29°C had increased resistance to WSSV.\n\n"}
{"id": "2167411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167411", "title": "Taura syndrome", "text": "Taura syndrome\n\nTaura syndrome (TS) is one of the more devastating diseases affecting the shrimp farming industry worldwide. It was first described in Ecuador during the summer of 1992. In March 1993, it returned as a major epidemic and was the object of extensive media coverage. Retrospective studies have suggested a case of Taura syndrome might have occurred on a shrimp farm in Colombia as early as 1990 and the virus was already present in Ecuador in mid-1991. Between 1992 and 1997, the disease spread to all major regions of the Americas where whiteleg shrimp (\"Litopenaeus vannamei\") is cultured. The economic impact of TS in the Americas during that period might have exceeded US$2 billion by some estimates.\n\nThe 1992 Ecuadorian TS epidemic occurred concurrently with an outbreak of black leaf wilt disease in banana plantations.\nThe outbreak of black leaf disease led to an increase in fungicide usage within the Taura River basin district near the city of Guayaquil. The fungicides propiconazole (Tilt, Ciba-Geigy) and tridemorph (Calixin, BASF) used to control black leaf, ran off into nearby ponds and were initially thought to be responsible for the disease. Analytical data demonstrated propiconazole in water, sediments and hepatopancreas tissues of shrimp harvested from affected farms in Ecuador. No other pesticides were discovered.\n\nIn January 1994, at the request of Ciba-Geigy, a workshop on Taura syndrome was held at the Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory of the University of Arizona. Experts from several countries with expertise in shrimp and insect pathology, shrimp nutrition, toxicology, mycology, water quality and farm management participated in the workshop. Industry representatives also participated. The group developed recommendations as to the standardization of the research on TS and suggested that studies be done to evaluate whether fungicides or as-yet unrecognized agents were responsible for the syndrome.\n\nDr. Jim Brock, the aquatic disease specialist for the State of Hawaii during this period, first demonstrated the disease could be transmitted by feeding Taura victims to healthy shrimp in early 1994. The dying test shrimp were then fed to a new set of shrimp, which was dying at the same rate. Rivers' postulates were fulfilled in 1994 by Dr. Ken Hasson and co-researchers at the University of Arizona. This proved the viral etiology of the syndrome. The virus was named Taura syndrome virus, often referred to as TSV. The virus is referred to by the name infectious cuticular epithelial necrosis virus (ICENV) by some authors in Latin America. Taura syndrome is a notifiable disease by the Office international des Épizooties (OIE), which reflects the serious nature and devastating impact of the disease.\n\nTaura syndrome virus was first classified as a possible member of the family Picornaviridae based on biological and physical characteristics. It was later reclassified in the Dicistroviridae family, genus Cripavirus. It has since been reassigned to a second genus in the same family - the Aparavirus.\n\nTSV is a 32 nm nonenveloped particle with an icosahedral morphology and a buoyant density of 1.338g/ml. The genome is single-stranded positive-sense and has 10,205 nucleotides (excluding the 3' poly-A tail). The capsid consists of three major proteins: CP1 (40 kDa), CP2 (55 kDa) and CP3 (24 kDa) alongside a minor protein of 58 kDa.\n\nAudelo-del-Valle in 2003 reported certain primate cell lines could be used to culture TSV. Later studies demonstrated their report was based on misinterpreted data. TSV does not appear to be a potential zoonosis. All virus amplifications require the use of live shrimp, as there is no continuous cell line that supports the growth of shrimp viruses.\n\nRNA viruses such as TSV have high rates of spontaneous mutation. These very high rates might be due to the lack of proofreading function of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and have resulted in the emergence of several genetic variants of the virus. As of May 2009, four genetic clusters are recognized: Belize (TSV-BZ), America (TSV-HI), Southeast Asia and Venezuela. The Belize strain is considered the most virulent. Point mutations in TSV capsid proteins might provide specific isolates with selective advantages such as host adaptability, increased virulence or increased replication ability. Even small variations in the TSV genome can result in substantial differences in virulence.\n\nAll TSV variants are similar in shape and size, with light variations. The average size of TSV-BZ virus particles is 32.693+/- 1.834 nm compared to TSV-HI with a size of 31.485 +/- 1.187 nm. The region of highest genetic difference is within the capsid protein CP2, with pairwise comparison of nucleotide showing a 0 to 3.5% difference amongst isolates. The most variations in CP2 occur at the 3'-terminal sequence; this may be because it is less constrained by structural requirements and more exposed than other regions of the protein.\n\nTSV has been reported from virtually all shrimp-growing regions of the Americas, including Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and Venezuela, as well as from the states of Hawaii, Texas, Florida and South Carolina. Until 1998, it was considered to be a Western Hemisphere virus. The first Asian outbreak occurred in Taiwan. It has more recently been identified in Thailand, Myanmar, China, Korea, and Indonesia, where it has been associated with severe epizootics in farmed \"Penaeus vannamei\" and \"Penaeus monodon\".\n\nThe wide distribution of the disease has been attributed to the movement of infected host stocks for aquaculture purposes. This might have been helped by the highly stable nature of the virus. Importation of TSV-infected \"P. vannamei\" from the Western Hemisphere is thought to have been the origin of the outbreak in Taiwan. This was further suggested by the genomic similarity of the Taiwan and Western Hemisphere isolates. TSV appeared in Thailand in 2003. Due to the similarities in deduced CP2 amino acids sequence and the chronology of the disease outbreaks in relation to imported stocks, at least some of the Thai isolates likely originated from Chinese stocks.\n\nTaura syndrome can spread rapidly when introduced in new areas. A shrimp farmer described the 1995 outbreak in Texas as, \"This thing spread like a forest fire... There was no stopping it. I just sat there and watched it and in a matter of three days, my shrimp were gone. Dead!\" \n\nTSV is known to affect many shrimp species. It causes serious diseases in the postlarval, juvenile and adult stages of \"Penaeus vannamei\". It also affects severely \"P. setiferus\", \"P. stylirostris\", \"P. schmitti\", and \"Metapenaeus ensis\". \"P. chinensis\" is highly susceptible to the disease in experimental bioassays.\n\nVariation occurs within species, and TSV-resistant strains of shrimp have been developed. Wild stocks are showing increased resistance, perhaps through intense natural selection. Reports of TS in the wild are limited, but in February 1995, the Mexican Fisheries Ministry reported the presence of TSV in wild-type shrimp captured on the border of Mexico and Guatemala. As of 2007, no confirmed reports indicated TSV is infectious to other groups of decapod or nondecapod crustaceans.\n\nIn farm situations, TS often causes high mortality during the first 15 to 40 days of stocking into shrimp ponds. The course of infection may be acute (5–20 days) to chronic (more than 120 days) at the pond and farm level. The disease has three distinct phases that sometimes overlap: acute, transition and chronic. The disease cycle has been characterized in detail in \"P. vannamei\".\n\nAfter the initial infection, the acute phase develops. Clinical signs can occur as early as 7 hours after infection in some individuals and last for about 4–7 days. Infected shrimp display anorexia, lethargy and erratic swimming behavior. They also present opacification of the tail musculature, soft cuticle and, in naturally occurring infection, a red tail due to the expansion of the red chromatophores. Mortality during this phase can be as high as 95%. The acute phase is characterized histologically by multifocal areas of nuclear pyknosis/karyorrhexis and numerous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the cuticular epithelium and the subcutis of the general body surface, all appendages, gills, hindgut, esophagus and stomach. The pyknosis and karyorrhexis give a “buckshot” appearance to the tissue and are considered pathognomonic for the disease. In severe infections the antennal gland tubule epithelium, the hematopoietic tissues and the testis are also affected. This occurs mainly in severe infection following injection of viral particles and has not been reported from naturally infected \"P. vannamei\". Shrimp that survive the acute stage enter a transitional stage.\n\nShrimp in the transitional phase show randomly distributed, melanized (brownish/black) lesions within of the cuticle of the cephalothorax and tail region. These foci are the sites of acute lesions which have progressed onto subsequent stages of hemocytic inflammation, cuticular epithelium regeneration and healing and which might be secondarily infected with bacteria. These foci are negative for TSV by \"in situ\" hybridization (ISH) using a TSV-specific cDNA probe. Histologically, these shrimp present focal active acute lesions and the onset of lymphoid organ spheroids (LOSs) development. By ISH with TSV-specific probes, a diffuse positive signal can be observed within the walls of the lymphoid organ of normal appearance with or without focal probe signals within developing LOSs. These shrimp will be lethargic and anorexic, possibly because of the redirection of their energy and metabolic resources toward wound repair and recovery. If the shrimp undergo another successful moult following the transitional phase, they will cast off the melanized lesions and enter the chronic phase.\n\nThe chronic phase is first seen six days after infection and persist for at least 12 months under experimental conditions. This phase is characterized histologically by the absence of acute lesions and the presence of LOS of successive morphologies. These LOSs are positive by ISH for TSV. A low prevalence of ectopic spheroids can also be observed in some cases. LOSs are not by themselves characteristic of TSV infection and can be found in other viral diseases of shrimp such as lymphoid organ vacuolization virus (LOVV), lymphoid parvo-like virus (LPV), lymphoid organ virus (LOV), rhabdovirus of penaeid shrimp (RPS) and yellowhead virus (YHV). Diagnosis of the disease during the chronic phase is problematic, as shrimp do not display any outward signs of the disease and do not show mortality from the infection. Survivors may become carriers for life. Shrimp with chronic TSV infection are not as vigorous as uninfected shrimp, as demonstrated by their inability to tolerate a salinity drop as well as uninfected shrimp. A 2011 study by Laxminath Tumburu looked at the relationship between an environmental stressor (pesticide Endosulfan) and Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and their interactions on the susceptibility and molting of marine penaeid shrimp \"L. vannamei\" and found the interference of endosulfan-associated stress led to increasingly higher susceptibility at postmolt stage during the acute phase of the TSV disease cycle.\n\nThe most likely route for transmission of TSV is cannibalism of dead infected shrimp. The virus can be spread from one farm to another by seagulls and aquatic insects. Infectious TSV has been found in the feces of laughing gulls that fed on infected shrimp during an epizootic in Texas. Controlled laboratory studies have documented that TSV remains infectious for up to one day after passage through the gut of white leghorns chicken (\"Gallus domesticus\") and laughing gulls. Although, vertical transmission is suspected this has not been experimentally confirmed.\n\nShrimp surviving a TSV infection are lifelong carriers of the virus and are a significant source of virus for susceptible animals. It has been hypothesized that TSV was introduced to Southeast Asia with chronically infected shrimp imported from the Western Hemisphere. The ability of TSV to remain at least partly infectious after one or several freeze-thaw cycles might be a contributing factor facilitating its spread in the international commerce of frozen commodity products. Mechanisms by which infected frozen shrimp could spread the virus include: reprocessing of shrimp at processing plants with release of infectious liquid wastes, disposal of solid wastes in landfills where seagulls could acquire the virus and then spread it, the use of shrimp as bait by sport fishermen and the use of imported shrimp as fresh food for other aquatic species.\n\nA presumptive diagnosis of acute TSV infection can be established by the presence of dead or dying shrimp in cast nets used for routine evaluation. Predatory birds are attracted to diseased ponds and feed heavily on the dying shrimp. The unique signs of infection caused by TS, such as the cuticular melanized spots, can provide a strong presumptive diagnosis, but care must be taken as these can be confused with other diseases, such as bacterial shell disease. In general pathognomonic histopathological lesions are the first step in confirmatory diagnosis. Discrete foci of pyknotic and karyorhectic nuclei and inflammation are seen within the cuticular tissues. The lymphoid organ might display spheroids, but is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nThe genome of the virus has been cloned and cDNA probes are available for diagnosis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods have been developed for detection of TSV and are very sensitive. Real-time techniques allow for quantification of the virus. The IQ2000TM TSV detection system, a RT-PCR method, is said to have a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction.\n\nRNA-based methods are limited by the relative fragility of the viral RNA. Prolonged fixation in Davidsons' fixative might result in RNA degradation due to fixative-induced acid hydrolysis. An alternative for virus detection is the use of specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the relatively stable proteins in the viral capsid. Rapid diagnostic tests using MAbs are now in common use for white spot syndrome virus and are being marketed under the commercial name of \"Shrimple\". Similar tests for TSV, yellowhead virus and infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus are currently under development.\n\nManagement strategies for the disease have included raising more resistant species such as the Western blue shrimp (\"Penaeus stylirostris\") and stocking of specific pathogen free (SPF) or specific pathogen resistant (SPR) shrimp. Relatively simple laboratory challenges can be used to predict the performance of selected stocks in farms where TSV is enzootic. The resistant shrimp lines currently raised have reached nearly complete resistance to some TSV variants and further improvement due to breeding for TSV-resistance is expected be minor for these variants. Significant improvements in TSV survival were made through selective breeding despite low to moderate heritability for this trait.\n\nA management strategy used to reduce the impact of TS has been the practice of stocking postlarval shrimp at increased stocking density. Following this strategy, farms would experience mortality due to TS at an early stage of the production cycle, before substantial feeding had begun and the surviving shrimp would be resistant to further TSV challenges. Other techniques used with limited efficacy have been the polyculture of shrimp with tilapia and maintenance of near-optimal water quality conditions in the grow-out ponds with reduction of organic loading. Transgenic shrimp expressing an antisense TSV coat protein (TSV-CP) exhibited increased survival in TSV challenges. The public perception of transgenic animals, as well as current technical limitations, limit the use of transgenic animals as a mean of disease control.\n"}

It occurs in Pacific farmed and wild shrimp, but not in wild shrimp on the Atlantic coast of the Americas. The shrimp-farming industry has developed several broodstocks of both \"P. stylirostris\" and \"P. vannamei\" that are resistant against IHHN infection.\n\nThe disease is caused by a single-stranded DNA virus of the species \"Decapod pestylhamaparvovirus 1\", earlier known as IHHN virus, the smallest of the known penaeid shrimp viruses (22 nm).\n\nThis virus has been classified as Penaeus stylirostris hamaparvovirus. The genome is 4.1 kilobases in length. There are three open reading frames in its genome: a left non structural protein (NS1) of 2001 base pairs (bp), a mid non structural protein (NS2) of 1092 bp and a right capsid protein of 990 bp. NSI appears to be a DNA helicase with ATPase activity.\n\nThe mutation rate in the genome has been estimated to be ~1.4 x 10 substitutions/site/year. This is considerably higher than the rate in the double stranded DNA viruses and similar to that found in RNA viruses.

It appears to have been popular in Norfolk and other parts of East Anglia. Of all the traditional forms of football played in Europe, it appears to have been one of the toughest and most dangerous. This probably explains why it died out during the early 19th century.\n\nThe first-ever English-Latin dictionary, \"Promptorium parvulorum\" (c. 1440), offers the following definition of camp ball: \"Campan, or playar at foott balle, pediluson; campyon, or champion\" \n\nThe game was originally played in the middle of town, where the objective was to take the ball to the opposing side of town. It was later played in the country, often in a special field set aside for the purpose known as a camping-place, camping close or camping \"pightle\". A reminder of this old game can be found in Swaffham where, behind the market place lies the Camping land where the game was played. The custom in medieval times was to play games after church services, and often camping fields were sited near the church.\n\nAlthough this game was rough, it was not without rules. In fact there is evidence from Moore (1823) that there were teams, goals, rules and even ball passing between team members (a development often attributed to much later): \n\nIf the game described by Moore in 1823 was substantially the same as medieval \"camping\", then it is noteworthy that despite the \"Promptorium's\" definition of it as a form of \"foott balle,\" the game apparently involved no kicking and was rather reminiscent of the passing game in rugby.\n\nMatches were often between rival parishes and stirred local passions. According to the historian Moore, writing in 1823, \"amid shouting and roaring of the population the players were not disposed to treat one another gently.\" Some games even turned so nasty that there was serious injury and loss of life.\n\nIt was recorded that a match at Diss Common in the early nineteenth century was so brutal that nine men were killed or died of their injuries. While some people thought that camping was a combination of all athletic excellence others saw it as little more than a stand up fight. The contest for the ball 'never ends without black eyes and bloody noses, broken heads or shins, and some serious mischief,' a writer said in 1830 when camping popularity was at its height.\n\nA modified game called \"civil play\" banned boxing as a component of the game. The game was played by passing the ball from hand to hand. To score, a player had to carry the ball through his own goal. Matches were usually for the best of seven or nine goals or \"snotches\" which normally took two or three hours, but a game of fourteen hours had been recorded in a county match.\n\nA feature of so-called friendly matches were prizes for those who played well. These consisted of money, hats, gloves or shoes. Incidents of violence seem in the end to have turned public opinion against camping and it was gradually replaced by a gentler kicking game. This game had roused great scorn amongst camping enthusiasts when it first began to make its influence felt in the 1830s.\n\n"}

{"id": "2167447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167447", "title": "Pentode", "text": "Pentode\n\nA pentode is an electronic device having five active electrodes. The term most commonly applies to a three-grid amplifying vacuum tube (thermionic valve), which was invented by Gilles Holst and Bernhard D.H. Tellegen in 1926. The pentode consists of an evacuated glass envelope containing five electrodes in this order: a cathode heated by a filament, a control grid, a screen grid, a suppressor grid, and a plate (anode). The pentode (called a \"triple-grid amplifier\" in some early literature) was developed from the tetrode tube by the addition of a third grid, the suppressor grid. This served to prevent secondary emission electrons emitted by the plate from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and parasitic oscillations in the tetrode. The pentode is closely related to the beam tetrode. Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors. Their main use now is in high power industrial applications such as radio transmitters. The obsolete consumer tubes are still used in a few legacy and specialty vacuum tube audio devices.\n\n\nThe simple tetrode or \"screen-grid tube\" offered a larger amplification factor, more power and a higher frequency capability than the earlier triode. However, in the tetrode \"secondary electrons\" knocked out of the anode (plate) by the electrons from the cathode striking it (a process called secondary emission) can flow to the screen grid due to its relatively high potential. This current of electrons leaving the anode reduces the net anode current \"I\". As the anode voltage \"V\" is increased, the electrons from the cathode hit the anode with more energy, knocking out more secondary electrons, increasing this current of electrons leaving the anode. The result is that in the tetrode the anode current \"I\" is found to \"decrease\" with increasing anode voltage \"V\", over part of the characteristic curve. This property (Δ\"V\"/Δ\"I\" < 0) is called negative resistance. It can cause the tetrode to become unstable, leading to parasitic oscillations in the output, called dynatron oscillations in some circumstances.\n\nThe pentode, as introduced by Tellegen, has an additional electrode, or third grid, called the suppressor grid, located between the screen grid and the anode, which solves the problem of secondary emission. The suppressor grid is given a low potential—it is usually either grounded or connected to the cathode. Secondary emission electrons from the anode are repelled by the negative potential on the suppressor grid, so they can't reach the screen grid but return to the anode. The primary electrons from the cathode have a higher kinetic energy, so they can still pass through the suppressor grid and reach the anode.\n\nPentodes, therefore, can have higher current outputs and a wider output voltage swing; the anode/plate can even be at a lower voltage than the screen grid yet still amplify well.\n\n\nPentode tubes were first used in consumer-type radio receivers. A well-known pentode type, the EF50, was designed before the start of World War II, and was extensively used in radar sets and other military electronic equipment. The pentode contributed to the electronic preponderance of the Allies.\n\nThe Colossus computer and the Manchester Baby used large numbers of EF36 pentode tubes. Later on, the 7AK7 tube was expressly developed for use in computer equipment.\n\nAfter World War II, pentodes were widely used in TV receivers, particularly the successor to the EF50, the EF80. Vacuum tubes were replaced by transistors during the 1960s. However, they continue to be used in certain applications, including high-power radio transmitters and (because of their well-known valve sound) in high-end and professional audio applications, microphone preamplifiers and electric guitar amplifiers. Large stockpiles in countries of the former Soviet Union have provided a continuing supply of such devices, some designed for other purposes but adapted to audio use, such as the GU-50 transmitter tube.\n\nA pentode can have its screen grid (grid 2) connected to the anode (plate), in which case it reverts to an ordinary triode with commensurate characteristics (lower anode resistance, lower mu, lower noise, more drive voltage required). The device is then said to be \"triode-strapped\" or \"triode-connected\". This is sometimes provided as an option in audiophile pentode amplifier circuits, to give the sought-after \"sonic qualities\" of a triode power amplifier. A resistor may be included in series with the screen grid to avoid exceeding the screen grid's power or voltage rating, and to prevent local oscillation. Triode-connection is a useful option for audiophiles who wish to avoid the expense of 'true' power triodes.\n\n"}
{"id": "2167450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167450", "title": "Emily Barton", "text": "Emily Barton\n\nEmily Barton (born 1969) is an American novelist, critic, and academic. She is the author of three novels: \"The Testament of Yves Gundron\" (2000), \"Brookland\" (2006) and \"The Book of Esther\" (2016).\n\nBarton was raised in New Jersey, where she attended Kent Place School. She attended Harvard College, from which she graduated \"summa cum laude\" and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society. She also earned an MFA in fiction writing from the Iowa Writers' Workshop.\n\nBarton's first novel, \"The Testament of Yves Gundron\", was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in January 2000. The book's titular character is an inventor in the primitive and isolated farming village of Mandragora. When Gundron invents the harness – a device which alters the nature of farming – the villagers' lives change irrevocably. As Yves begins to recount the story of these changes, Ruth Blum, a Harvard anthropologist, arrives to study the village. Although the novel at first appears to take place in the Middle Ages, Yves's brother tells tales of travels to \"Indo-China,\" and the villagers sing songs that are demonstrably examples of the blues.\n\nSome critics found Barton's technique of juxtaposing cultural milieus jarring. But many appreciated the novel's postmodern gamesmanship. In a rare blurb, the famously reticent writer Thomas Pynchon praised \"Yves Gundron\" as “[b]lessedly post-ironic, engaging and heartfelt—a story that moves with ease and certainty, deeply respecting the given world even as it shines with the integrity of dream,” and John Freeman, writing for \"Time Out New York\", called it “An engrossing folktale that, in our technology-crazed era, ought to be required reading.” \"Yves Gundron\" was named a \"New York Times\" Notable Book of the Year for 2000. It has been translated into Dutch, French, Norwegian, and Greek.\n\nBarton's second novel, \"Brookland\", was published in 2006. \"Brookland\" takes as its basis Thomas Pope's \"Rainbow Bridge\", a bridge that was proposed for the East River nearly a hundred years before the construction of John Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge, but which was never actually built. In \"Brookland\", the bridge is the brainchild not of Pope but of a character invented by Barton: Prudence (\"Prue\") Winship, the proprietor of a successful gin distillery she inherited from her father. The novel is the story of the costs, both financial and personal, that the planning, construction, and ultimate destruction of the bridge exact from Prue and her community. Upon its publication, \"Brookland\" received widespread praise; in a review in the \"New Yorker\" magazine, Joan Acocella wrote that Prue Winship \"is not a 'good-models' feminist heroine, nor is she one of the bad-girl heroines of second-stage feminism. She is a thorny, struggling soul. Together with the book's profound treatment of the spiritual ills born of the Enlightenment, this wonderful character is Barton's main gift to us.” \"Brookland\" was also named a \"The New York Times\" Notable Book, and was named one of the twenty-five best works of fiction and poetry of the year by the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nHer third novel, \"The Book of Esther\", is an alternate history tale in which the sixteen year-old heroine leads the resistance of a Jewish Empire against a German invasion in 1942, using magic and steampunk technology.\n\nBarton's fiction has appeared in \"Conjunctions\", \"Story magazine\", and \"American Short Fiction\", and she has published essays in such venues as Moistworks.com and the \"Boston Review\". She frequently writes book reviews for \"The New York Times Book Review\", the \"Los Angeles Times Book Review\", and \"Bookforum\".\n\nBarton joined the Creative Writing faculty at Oberlin College in 2018. She previously taught at Yale University, New York University, Columbia University, Princeton University, Smith College, Bard College, and Eugene Lang College. She is married to the short-story writer Thomas Israel Hopkins; the couple has two sons.\n\nIn a 2008 essay at Nextbook.org (now Tablet Magazine), entitled \"Eli Miller's Seltzer Delivery Service,\" Barton writes at length of her Jewish upbringing, although in one 2007 article she described herself as “a Jewess who wouldn't leave the house without a stash of Tylenol, safety pins and mints.”\n"}

He had a brief stint at MLS club LA Galaxy, but never officially played for the club, and was a free agent, before retiring in 2010.\n\nBabayaro represented the Nigerian national football team from 1995 to 2004, and was part of two Olympic squads, two World Cup squads and three African Cup of Nations squads.\n\nBorn in Kaduna, Babayaro began his playing career at Nigerian side Plateau United, before moving to Belgian club Anderlecht in 1994, and eventually would make a name for himself, quickly gaining first-choice status although still a teenager. Babayaro set records as the youngest player to make an appearance and to receive a red card in the UEFA Champions League. He was sent off in a match against Steaua Bucuresti in a 1–1 draw, aged 16 years and 86 days.\n\nBabayaro was signed by Chelsea after being spotted by scout Lewis Durkin in April 1997. He moved for a transfer fee of £2.25 million, a club record paid for a teenager at the time. He made his debut in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup against Slovan Bratislava, but an injury sustained in the 6–1 win over rivals Tottenham Hotspur in December 1997 ruled him out for the rest of the season. This meant he missed their victories in the 1998 Football League Cup Final and the 1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. However, with Chelsea he went on to win the 1998 UEFA Super Cup, the FA Cup and Charity Shield in 2000, and reached the 2002 FA Cup Final. He was also instrumental in Chelsea's memorable run in the 1999-2000 UEFA Champions League. It was to end in heartbreak for Babayaro as he was sent off in extra time against Barcelona, as they bowed out of the competition at the quarter final stage. He faced competition from Graeme Le Saux during his seven-year spell, but managed to play over 200 games for the London side. His acrobatic celebrations with backflips were noted and loved by the fans of the club.\n\nThe steady form of Wayne Bridge saw Babayaro start only four FA Premier League matches for Chelsea in 2004–05 under new manager José Mourinho. Chelsea ended the season as Premier League champions.\n\nIn January 2005, he left Chelsea to join Newcastle United on an undisclosed fee, where he established himself as first choice left back. He scored his first and what turned out to be his only Newcastle goal in a 3–1 win over Coventry City in the FA Cup.\n\nIn September 2006, Babayaro was given a three-match ban by The Football Association for slapping Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt in the face, while Liverpool took a corner. The slap was not seen by the referee Mark Halsey, but later footage showed Babayaro punch the Dutchman in the face. Babayaro accepted the allegations and apologised to Kuyt.\n\nOn 10 February 2007, after a 2–1 win over Liverpool, then-Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder revealed that just 12 hours before kick-off, Babayaro had called him saying his younger brother David had died from tuberculosis. Despite this, Babayaro insisted he would still play and put in a solid performance which earned him praise from Roeder and the fans. This fine form continued into United's 3–1 away victory against Zulte Waregem, in the UEFA Cup.\n\nDue to his many injury problems it was mutually decided, on 10 December 2007, that Babayaro should be released from his contract with immediate effect and a compensation figure was agreed.\n\nIn January 2009, former Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd described Babayaro as a \"disgrace\" who \"didn't pull his weight\" during a televised BBC interview.\n\nOn 21 January 2008, 29-year-old Babayaro came to an agreement with the LA Galaxy to join them on a three-year contract, effective immediately.\n\nWith this move, the Nigerian re-joined Galaxy coach Ruud Gullit who previously brought him to Chelsea in 1997 and spent a season coaching him there. This time again, it was the recently hired Gullit who wanted Babayaro at his new club. However, it did not take long for the move to turn sour. Thinking that he had arrived at sort of an American superclub that only a year earlier gave David Beckham what was widely reported to be the $250 million contract, Babayaro was agitated by what he considered to be \"shabby\" accommodations – from having to fly in the economy class to sharing a hotel room on the road. His lack of commitment in training and preseason games reflected those feelings and he soon got on Gullit's and club president and general manager Alexi Lalas's bad side.\n\nOn 3 March, Babayaro was waived by the Galaxy after playing only 45 minutes in a preseason friendly against FC Seoul, receiving a yellow card and conceding a penalty in the process. The reason for this unexpected release was not stated explicitly by Galaxy front office. \"After a period of evaluation, it was decided that it would be in the best interest of the club and the player to part ways,” Lalas said in a statement. “It is unfortunate that it did not work out, but Ruud and our technical staff are hard at work putting together this team and difficult decisions have to be made.\"\n\nDuring pre-season for the 2008–09 English league season, Babayaro trained with Premier League club Portsmouth at the invitation of manager Harry Redknapp with a view to signing for the FA Cup holders. On 14 August 2008 Redknapp revealed that he would not offer Babayaro a contract at Fratton Park.\n\nOn 8 July 2010, Babayaro officially announced his retirement from football.\n\nAfter being part of the victorious Nigerian team at the Under-17 World Championships in 1993, Babayaro made his international senior debut in the Afro-Asian Cup of Nations in 1995, against Uzbekistan. The following year, he was part of the Nigeria Olympic gold medal winning team at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, making the tournament's all-star team. He scored in the Gold Medal game itself against Argentina. After getting a knee injury in December 1997 in the Premier League, Babayaro recovered just in time to make the France 98 squad. He was also Nigeria's captain at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, and took part in the Korea/Japan 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBabayaro was part of Nigeria's squad for the 2004 African Nations Cup in Tunisia, but was controversially sent home, alongside Yakubu and Victor Agali for indiscipline. Although never officially announcing his retirement from international football, his final appearance from the national team was against Morocco in a group stage match.\n\nBabayaro's brother, Emmanuel, a goalkeeper, was also part of Nigeria's 1996 Olympics gold medal winning team.\n\nBabayaro was acquitted of indecent assault in 1999. He later sued the \"Daily Star\" for a headline suggesting he had been charged with rape and won an apology and damages. He was declared bankrupt in 2011.\n\n\"Statistics include 2 Charity Shield appearances in 1998 and 2000.\"\n\nAnderlecht\n\nChelsea\n\nNigeria U17\n\nNigeria U23\n\n\n"}

He also served as head of music at Queen's University, Kingston. His works earned him the reputation of one of the founding fathers of electroacoustic music in Canada. Among his pupils are Kevin Austin, John Fodi, Clifford Ford, Hugh Hartwell, John Hawkins, Alan Heard, Richard Hunt, Donald Patriquin, and Alex Tilley.\n\nIn 2003, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2007, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Selections from his correspondence with American composer George Rochberg were published in 2007.\n\nIstván Anhalt was born in Budapest, Hungary to a Jewish family on April 12, 1919. He was son of Arnold Anhalt and Katalin Anhalt (née Herzfeld), When he was still an infant, Anhalt's parents separated; he lived with his mother until the age of twelve, attending elementary school from 1925 to 1929. Although she had some interest in serious music and opera, his mother was not especially musical, she did have a piano; Anhalt began taking piano lessons at the age of six with a teacher who lived in his neighborhood and later from a family friend until he was twelve years of age. From the age of ten, he attended the Dániel Berzsenyi Secondary school, failing several subjects at first but later excelling and graduating in 1937. He also attended outdoor musical performances on Margaret Island.\n\nAt age twelve, Anhalt went to live with his father, who had remarried in 1931. Encouraged by his father's love of music, Anhalt developed a good ear for harmony, and taught himself to play the violin. Anhalt learned to speak four languages, Hungarian, German, French, and English.\n\nHis father's financial troubles, his half-sister's birth in 1935, and tension between him and his step mother led Anhalt to move again a few years later to stay with his maternal grandparents. At about that time, Anhalt overheard László Gyopár, a peer from a neighboring school, play a piece he had composed himself at the piano. Anhalt recognized the influence of Bach on the piece, and, admiring Gyopár's compositional achievements, decided to learn how to write music and compose his own pieces. Anhalt and Gyopár became good friends, and soon after, Anhalt began to receive private harmony lessons with Géza Falk. Gyopár was attending the Academy of Music at the time, where Anhalt audited Zoltán Kodály's class from 1936 to 1937 before passing the entrance exam and joining his friend at the academy.\n\nAnhalt studied piano with Kodaly at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music; he graduated with exceptional marks in 1941. He also continued his studies for the next year and a half by attending classes from Turkish linguistics to Folklore at Pázmány University and attending a seminar by János Ferencsik for conductors.\n\nAnhalt was drafted into the forced labour service of the Hungarian Army in 1940 during World War II.\n\nIn 1942, during the Second World War, Anhalt and his best friend at the academy were both forced to enter a forced-labour brigade for young Jewish men. Anhalt's friend was killed by a soldier in the unit. Anhalt escaped from the brigade, disguised himself as a seminarian, and hid until the war was over. He then made his way to Paris, where he had access to music teachers and abundant artistic stimulation.\n\nIn the late 1940s, he studied under Louis Fourestier, Nadia Boulanger and Soulima Stravinsky before emigrating to Canada in 1949.\n\nAnhalt emigrated to Canada in 1949, as a recipient of a Lady Davis Fellowship. He settled in Montreal, and soon met Beate Frankenberg, a biochemist. The pair married in 1952, and together they have two daughters, Carol Greaves and Helen Jennifer Marcello, and two grandchildren.\n\nFor twenty two years Anhalt taught analysis and composition at McGill University in the Faculty of Music. He established the Theory and Composition Departments, He established the music composition program for the institution, was chairman for the Theory Department, and developed and directed the McGill University Electronic Music Studio (EMS). He composed continually during that time as well.\n\nAnhalt met George Rochberg at an International Conference of Composers at the Stratford Festival in Ontario during the summer of 1960, and the two became friends. Rochberg was born in New Jersey, and both come from a Jewish background.\n\nAnhalt's mixed work schedule of administration, composition, and teaching was one he carried with him to Kingston, Ontario in 1971 when he became the head of Queen's University's Department of Music. He remained in this position until 1981. He continued to teach at the university until 1984 when he retired. During his years at Queen's University, Anhalt continued to write, compose and teach. His composition \"La Tourangelle\" premiered in July 1975, and soon after he began to work on another piece, which would be his second opera, \"Winthrop\". All the while, he also worked on his monograph \"Alternative Voices\". He became a mentor for a number of his students, many of whom kept in touch with him until the final years of his life.\n\nAfter his retirement, Anhalt continued to composer, and to write scholarly and other articles. He died at the age of 92, on February 24, 2012, in Kingston, at St. Mary's of the Lake Hospital.\n\nAnhalt is one of the earliest serious composers of electronic music. His music underwent changes over the years, and can be divided into four periods. Anhalt has a librettist for his dramatic works, beginning in 1969 with \"Foci\", and ending in 1999 with \"Millennial Mall\".\n\nAnhalt's early composing focused on a variety of works for chorus, solo voice, ensembles, and instrumental soloists. This period ended with the finalization of his work \"Symphony No. 1\", which won Anhalt both a national and an international reputation.\n\nThe next brief period in Anhalt's musical career was entirely dedicated to electronic music where he produced four compositions, and studying first-hand the newest developments and media during that time, in order to establish fresh and current concepts for his original work.\n\nFrom 1962 until 1971 Anhalt reworked, consolidated and expanded his experiences during the two previous periods. He combined electronic sounds with the sounds of the chorus or the orchestra in his \"Symphony of Modules\", \"Foci\", and \"Cento\". Anhalt also adopted a more flexible syntax, as well as a larger musical vocabulary to create new vocal and instrumental sounds. He began to use timbre, timing, and musical densities in new ways in his compositions.\n\n\"La Tourangelle\" is the first of three large scale works created by Anhalt after 1971. It is an hour-long piece that premiered in 1975, in a performance broadcast by CBC Radio. This \"musical tableau\" was composed for an orchestra of 16 players, five singer-narrators, and pre-recorded tapes for five operators. Its theme is the pursuit of God and meaning, and is based on the life of one of the earliest French women to settle in Canada, Marie de l’Incarnation.\n\n\"Winthrop\" is a parallel piece to \"La Tourangelle\", but focused on English Canada. The story is based on John Winthrop, a 17th-century Englishman who was the founder and governor of Boston, Massachusetts. It was completed in March 1983, and calls for a mixed choir, six solo singers, an instrumental ensemble of no less than 30 players, and a boys’ choir. Anhalt described this \"musical pageant\" as an exploration into the spiritual and personal aspects of a man, depicting how these supply meaning and significance to his actions.\n\nPublished in 1984, \"Alternative Voices\" is a written study of linguistics as a way of acquiring an understanding of the human voices’ potential in a choral compositional, as well as a contemporary vocal, context. In about 1967 Anhalt had started studies of the reflection of personalty through the voice in the composition classes he taught; he concentrated on this research while on his first sabbatical leave from 1976 to 1977. The work received favourable reviews, and was included in the list the 1984 outstanding academic books by Choice.\n\nIn \"Alternative Voices\", Anhalt makes recurrent references to some Canadian composers, as well as their music. He discusses the role of Canadian music and composers in the context of present-day thought in contemporary Western art, music, and philosophy. Rhythm, theatre, poetry, performing techniques, sound, speech, and the roots of language and music are explored, their components interconnected, as well as their usage are examined.\n\nThe publication of his work \"Alternative Voices\" and the finalization of \"Winthrop\" occurred in the same year that Anhalt retired from university teaching.\n\n\"Stage\"\n\n\n\"Orchestra\"\n\n\n\"Chamber\"\n\n\n\"Piano\"\n\n\n\"Choir\"\n\n\n\"Voice\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The total global production of farmed shrimp reached more than 2.1 million tonnes in 1991, representing a value of nearly US$9 billion. About 30% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, particularly in China and Indonesia. The other 54.1% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico are the largest producers. The largest exporting nation is Indonesia. \nShrimp farming has changed from traditional, small-scale businesses in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to growing shrimp at ever higher densities, and broodstock is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are of the family Penaeidae, and just two species – \"Litopenaeus vannamei\" (Pacific white shrimp) and \"Penaeus monodon\" (giant tiger prawn) – account for roughly 32.14% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial monocultures are very susceptible to diseases, which have caused several regional wipe-outs of farm shrimp populations. Increasing ecological problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both NGOs and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulation by governments. In 1999, a program aimed at developing and promoting more sustainable farming practices was initiated, including governmental bodies, industry representatives, and environmental organizations.\n\nFreshwater prawn farming shares many characteristics with, and many of the same problems as, marine shrimp farming. Unique problems are introduced by the developmental lifecycle of the main species (the giant river prawn, \"Macrobrachium rosenbergii\"). The global annual production of freshwater prawns in 2010 was about 670,000 tons, of which China produced 615,000 tons (92%).\n\nEyestalk ablation is the removal of one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) eyestalks from a crustacean. It is routinely practiced on female shrimps (or prawns) in almost every marine shrimp maturation or reproduction facility in the world, both research and commercial. The aim of ablation under these circumstances is to stimulate the female shrimp to develop mature ovaries and spawn.\n\nMost captive conditions for shrimp cause inhibitions in females that prevent them from developing mature ovaries. Even in conditions where a given species will develop ovaries and spawn in captivity, use of eyestalk ablation increases total egg production and increases the percentage of females in a given population that participate in reproduction. Once females have been subjected to eyestalk ablation, complete ovarian development often ensues within as little as 3 to 10 days.\n\n"}

After appearing in one story in 1968, the character lay dormant for almost 20 years. In 1984, \"Cobalt 60\" was revived by Vaughn Bodē's son Mark Bodé and writer Larry Todd.\n\nVaughn Bodē reputedly first drew the character Cobalt 60 on a piece of scratch paper in 1959. Nearly ten years later, in 1968, he wrote and drew a ten-page, black-and-white, pen-and-ink \"Cobalt 60\" story for Ken Rudolph's sci-fi fanzine \"Shangri L'Affaires\" (a.k.a. \"Shaggy\") #73. The story did not expound much on the character, instead concentrating on action and a thorough depiction of the story's setting. Bodē wrote a prose follow-up of the story, with pencil illustrations, for \"Shaggy\" #74. Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine Artist largely on the strength of \"Cobalt 60\". In addition, the initial ten-page story was later republished in \"Witzend\" #7 (April 1970), in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine \"Metal Hurlant\" in 1980, and in \"Epic Illustrated\" #27 (Dec. 1984).\n\nAlthough Bodē had created a cast of characters with whom he could populate a more involved story, he never did anything else with the material. (His son Mark Bodé said the project had made him too depressed.)\n\nIn 1984, \"Cobalt 60\" was revived via full-color art by Mark Bodé and a story scripted by Larry Todd (a former friend and collaborator of Vaughn Bodē's from the 1960s). These latter-day \"Cobalt 60\" stories were serialized in the magazine \"Epic Illustrated\" starting with the December 1984 issue. Although the story included all of Vaughn Bodé's original elements, Mark Bodé said the finished product was more \"lighthearted\" than what he felt his father would have done.\n\nIn 1988 The Donning Company/Starblaze Graphics published a 1988 \"Cobalt 60\" book collection. The separate episodes were later gathered in four magazine-sized comics published in 1992 by Tundra Press.\n\nAn additional \"Cobalt 60\" episode by Todd and Mark Bodé, titled \"Da Dust Devil,\" appeared in \"Heavy Metal Overdrive\" (a \"Heavy Metal Special\") vol. 9, #1 (1995).\n\n\"Cobalt 60\" takes place in a post-apocalyptic, \"Mad Max\"-like world inhabited by mutants, aliens, and other fantastic creatures. Its titular character embarks on a quest to avenge the death of his parents, murdered by the evil Strontium 90. After he succeeds in his quest, he inherits his father's kingdom, but prefers to return to his wild ways. \"Cobalt 60\" is very violent and quite graphic in its action scenes.\n\n\nThe visual style of Ralph Bakshi's 1977 animated film \"Wizards\" is heavily indebted to \"Cobalt 60\" and other works by Vaughn Bodē.\n\nOn October 25, 2006, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that Universal Pictures had acquired the rights to adapt \"Cobalt 60\" into a film with director Zack Snyder attached to the project. The director and Debbie Snyder were also set to produce the film.\n"}

In 1970 he pioneered Systems trading by using early punched card computers to test ideas on trading the markets. Seykota resided in Incline Village, Nevada, on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, but recently moved to Texas.\n\nAs a young man he attended high school near The Hague, Netherlands and also lived in Voorburg.\n\nIn 1970, he pioneered a computerized trading system (now known as Trading System) for the futures market for the brokerage house he and Michael Marcus were working for. Later, he decided to venture out on his own and manage a few of his client's accounts.\n\nMuch of Seykota's success was attributed to his development and utilization of computerized trading systems to which he first tested on a mainframe IBM computer. Later on, the brokerage house he had been working for adopted his system for their trades.\n\nHis interest in creating a computerized system was spawned after he read a letter by Richard Donchian on utilizing mechanical trend following systems for trading and also Donchian's 5- and 20-day moving average system. He was also inspired by the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre. His first trading system was developed based on exponential moving averages.\n\n\"Ed Seykota, Market Wizards\"\nSeykota improved this system over time, adapting the system to fit his trading style and preferences. With the initial version of the system being rigid, he later introduced more rules into the system in addition to pattern triggers and money management algorithms.\n\nAnother aspect of his success was his genuine love for trading and his optimistic demeanour. This factor sustained his efforts to continuously improve on his system although he never changed the response indicators of the system and instead fine tuned market stimuli.\n\nIn 1992, Seykota gathered together a group of traders to discuss their emotions, due to his concern that traders often allow their emotions to overrule their logic. They start gathering regularly and Seykota develops methods to support personal growth. Over the years it expands to include Tribes all over the world and people in many professions. Members help to develop a common set of practices Seykota calls TTP, the Trading Tribe Process. He describes these ideas and practices in his book \"The Trading Tribe\" (2005) and its refinement in an online article called \"TTP Extensions: Replacing the Zero-Point Process with the Rocks Process\" (2013).\n\n\nIn \"Market Wizards, Updated: Interviews With Top Traders\", author Jack D. Schwager devotes a chapter to Seykota and writes that his \"achievements must certainly rank him as one of the best traders of our time.\" \nSome of Seykota's students have included Michael Marcus, David Druz, Dean Giordano, Patrick Dougherty, Easan Katir, and Jason Russell of Acorn Global Investments\n\nTrader, instructor, and blogger Michael Martin is known to be one of Seykota's protégés as well.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It shares border with Patiala district of state Punjab and Kurukshetra, Jind and Karnal districts of Haryana. Kaithal district is situated in the North-West of the Haryana state. Its North-West boundaries which include Guhla-Cheeka is attached to Punjab State.\n\nHistorically, it was known as Kapisthal, meaning \"Abode of \"Kapi\"\", another name of Lord Hanuman, and it is said to have been founded by the Pandava Emperor, Yudhishthira of Mahabharata. Later word Kaithal is said to be derived from Kapisthala. It is traditionally connected with Hanuman and has a temple dedicated to Anjani, the mother of Hanuman. It is also said that it is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman and there is a temple constructed at that place known as \"Anjani Tila\" among the residents of Kaithal.\nThe Vridhakedara (Vidkyar) sanctum of Kaithal finds a mention in Vedic texts of Vaman Puran. Kaithal, with many of its temples, is also an important milestone in 48 Kos Parikrama pilgrimage.\n\nTimur stopped here in 1398, before attacking Delhi. Later, the city became a Muslim cultural center, under the rule of Delhi Sultanate. Tombs of several Sufi saints dating from the 13th century can be found in the city today; most important among them is that of Sheikh Salah -ud-din of Bhalkh (1246 CE). The town was renovated and a fort was built during the rule of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar, and as per Ain-i-Akbari, it was a \"pargana\", under the \"sarkar\" of Sirhind, and had developed into an agricultural centre \n\nRazia Sultana, the first woman ruler of India, reigned as the Sultana of Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240. She fled Delhi with Malik Altúniya after they were defeated on the 24th of Rabí'u-l awwal A.H. 638 (Oct. 1240), and reached Kaithal the next day, where their remaining forces abandoned them, and were killed on 13 November 1240. Tomb of Rajia Begam is still found here. This aspect is still not well known outside Kaithal, but residents know about the \"Mazaar\" of Razia Begum even generations later.\n\nTimur took the town in 1398, with his army massacring or plundering the inhabitants and destroying all villages along the way to Assandh. Many of the residents of Kaithal and the other cities had fled to Delhi in fear.\n\nIn 1767, it fell into the hands of the Singh Krora Misl chieftain, Bhai Desu Singh (d. 1781), who led a large Sikh force from his native village of Bhucho. In the Punjab. whose descendants, the bhais of Kaithal, ranked among the most powerful Cis-Sutlej states. The Sikh Chieftains of Kaithal, ruled from 1767 until its fall in 1843. By 1808, it came under British influence. The state was ruled by the Scindhia dynasty of the Maratha Empire and paid tributes to the Marathas, until the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost this territory to the British. Bhai Udey Singh ruled over Kaithal and proved as the last King. Bhai Udey Singh died on 14 March 1843. It became a municipality in 1867. In 1901, the town had a population of 14,408 and was the \"tehsil\" in the district of Karnal. The fort of the Bhais is still extant, and their title \"Bhai\" became common with the primary Sikh rulers. Peoples of Kaithal took active part in freedom struggle in 1857.\n\nKaithal is located at .

Punjabi and English are additional official languages.\n\nThere exist remains of the fort of the Bhais, and several Muslim tombs of the 13th century and later. The Kaithal fort has many gates made by British rulers and used to control the entry of trade goods and other items.\n\nThe fort was restored and renovated in 2016 (as seen in pictures). It now forms one of the most visible and important landmarks of Kaithal.\n\nTomb of Razia Sultana, who gained the throne of Delhi Sultanate under the Mamluk Sultanate, is situated 10 km north-west of the Kaithal city in Siwan on Kaithal-Cheeka-Patiala road. It is close to the jail constructed nearby by the present administration. She and her husband Malik Altunia who was the governor of Bhatinda (Punjab) were decapitated by the local Jat people of area. It is speculated that she might have been disinterred form Kaithal and then reburied at her Delhi's tomb.\n\nRaziya al-Din (1205 in Budaun – 13 October 1240), throne name Jalâlat ud-Dîn Raziyâ, usually referred to in history as Razia Sultana, was the Sultan of Delhi in India from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other Muslim princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary. Razia Sultan was the only woman ruler of both the Sultanate and the Mughal period, although other women ruled from behind the scenes. Razia refused to be addressed as Sultana because it meant \"wife or consort of a Sultan\". She would answer only to the title \"Sultan.\"\n\nIn Kaithal a national flag is hoisted above the ground in Hanuman Vatika.\n\nFollowing two pilgrimage points of Kaithal town form part of Kurukshetra's 48 kos pariktrama.\n\nVriddh Kedaar or Vidkyaar as it is popularly known is an important religious place for Hindus. This is one of the several pilgrimages in 48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra. This pilgrimage has been mentioned in the ancient text of Vamana Purana also.\n\nVaman Purana says : \n\"\"Kapisthaleti vikhyatam sarvapatakanashanam yasmina sthitaha swayam devovridha kedara samgjijitah\"a\" (2)\n\nThe Vridhakedara sanctum changed to \"Vidkyara\" as a result of the philological principle of \"mukhasukha\", or ease of speaking. it is located near pehowa chowk, the central point of Kaithal.\n\nIt is one of the famous temple of city, where divine eleven Rudra were placed long ago and the temple is known for its art, architecture, beautiful scriptures and large area, a big statue of Hanuman complements the beauty of this temple.\n\nAnjani was the name of mother of Lord Hanuman. Kaithal was earlier as Kapisthal, the abode of monkeys (or monkey God, Hanuman).\n\nThis is an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.\n\nOut of 108 Shiva Temples situated in the city, Gyrah-Rudri Temple is the most famous one of its own kind. Legend has it that it is at this place during Mahabharata era, Arjun had been conferred Pashupat Astra by praying to Lord Shiva.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSheikh Tayyab actual name was Lala Maidni Mal and he was one of the advisor to Mughal Emperor Akbar. He converted to Islam at the hands of Shah Kamal Qadri. His descendants from Hindu wife are called \"Qanugo\" and the place where they used to live is called Mohalla \"Qanugoyan\" in Kaithal. There was a tradition when someone from Qanugo used to get married, they used to send one pitcher of sweet drink (sherbat) to sheikh Tayyab masjid (also known as masjid of mirrors) and one pitcher to Shah Kamal shrine.\n\nOnce there was famine in the times of Shah Kamal. When he came to know about it, he asked to prepare Two big pots of special food (Dalya). One was prepared by a Muslim and the other one was prepared by a Hindu Brahman. It was announced that people from all over the city can come and eat day and night and take away this Dalya to their homes as well. There was a miracle that despite thousands of people eating from this langar, big pots were still filled with food. When famine ended, this food was also discontinued.\n\nAfter that incident, it was a tradition that every year in the month of \"sawan\" rainy season, on all four Thursdays of rainy season, people of every religion used to get this special food \"dalya\" prepared and send it to the dargah of baba shah kamal to be distributed among the needful.\n\nThe city have two railway stations named; Kaithal (KLE) and New Kaithal Halt (NKLE). The city had a rail connection to Kurukshetra and Narwana which further went to Jind (local trains only) until 2014, when the government started a rail service between Delhi and Kurukshetra via Kaithal. The move for this service was initiated and pushed by the previous Member of Parliament from Kurukshetra, Naveen Jindal with an aim to give people a convenient mode of transport to reach the capital. Earlier they had to board trains at the Kurukshetra railway station. In 2015, a new express train connecting Chandigarh and Jaipur via Kaithal has been started.\n\nThe city is connected to the state capital Chandigarh through National Highway 152.\nSH-8 to Pundri in the east (NH 44 catches up from Karnal to Delhi).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The team debuted in with a customer Shadow DN1 car, and began racing as a constructor with its own chassis in . The team had limited success in three seasons of racing, but everything was cut short by the death of Hill, Tony Brise and some of the team's top personnel in the crash of a light aircraft in the autumn before the season. The team was sponsored by Imperial Tobacco's Embassy cigarette brand and ran under various names during its time.\n\nEmbassy Racing With Graham Hill first came into being when Graham Hill decided to leave his previous team, Brabham, unhappy with the atmosphere there. He announced in late 1972 he was starting his own team, acting as owner and driver. Setting up shop in a warehouse based on an industrial estate in Hanworth, West London, Hill formed a small team of around 20 engineers and mechanics. \nSecuring sponsorship from Embassy, Hill started operating a team with cars purchased from Shadow. Things did not go well that year: the team's best finish was ninth at Zolder, being the last finisher among 9 cars (the former World Champion also started 23rd of 23 cars that race).\n\nThe chassis for were bought from Lola, and designated as the Lola T370. Graham Hill drove throughout the season and scored a point at the 1974 Swedish Grand Prix, but this was to be the team's only point that season. The second car was driven by Guy Edwards, and later Peter Gethin and Rolf Stommelen.\n\nThe T370 was still being used at the beginning of the season, until the team's new car was ready. The new car for 1975 was initially designated as the Lola T371, but when designer Andy Smallman left Lola to work full-time for Embassy Hill it was renamed the Hill GH1. Smallman's design drew heavily from the design of previous year's Lola cars.\n\nUnfortunately, the second race of the GH1 at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix was marred by the collapse of Rolf Stommelen's rear wing mounting, which pitched his car into the crowd and killed four people. Stommelen was injured in the accident and did not return until the second half of the season. He had been leading the race comfortably before the crash.\n\nAfter failing to qualify at the 1975 Monaco Grand Prix, a race he had won five times, Hill no longer drove the cars himself, and his driving role was taken over by Tony Brise. Brise, considered a rising star, finished sixth in the 1975 Swedish Grand Prix and qualified sixth for the 1975 Italian Grand Prix.\n\nAlan Jones took over the second car for most of the races that Stommelen missed; Jones finished fifth place in the 1975 German Grand Prix.\n\nFrançois Migault and Vern Schuppan were also behind the wheel of the second Hill that year.\n\nThe GH2 was the first Formula One car that Andy Smallman designed from scratch specifically for Graham Hill's team, and it was intended for use in the World Championship season. It was intended to replace the previous model, the Hill GH1, which had started life as the Lola T371. The GH2 used the ubiquitous Cosworth DFV engine, and featured a much smaller and streamlined chassis which resembled the Brabham BT44 and McLaren M23. Tony Brise began testing in the late summer of 1975 at Silverstone, and the times indicated the team could hope for a successful season. During the final test session at Paul Ricard in November 1975, the GH2 was performing well, being much faster than the GH1 and set up changes had made the car easy to drive. The test successful, the team packed up and flew back to England. \n\nAfter the deaths of Graham Hill, Tony Brise, Andy Smallman and Ray Brimble in November 1975, the GH2 project came to a halt. However, a GH2 was still built and is now in a British automobile museum.\n\nOn the evening of 29 November 1975 Graham Hill was piloting an Embassy Hill Piper Aztec light aircraft from France to London. His passengers were team manager Ray Brimble, team driver Tony Brise, designer Andy Smallman and mechanics Terry Richards and Tony Alcock. They were returning from Circuit Paul Ricard where they had been testing the Hill GH2 car being prepared for 1976. They were due to land at Elstree Airfield before onward travel to London to attend a party. Shortly before 10pm the plane hit trees beside a golf course at Arkley in thick fog. In the ensuing crash and fire everyone on board was killed. As the team now only consisted of Allan Turner, the deputy team manager, and two mechanics it was impossible to continue. Most of the team's assets were purchased by Walter Wolf and merged with those of Hesketh Racing and Williams to form Wolf's new team.\n\n"}

{"id": "2167521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167521", "title": "Kemalism", "text": "Kemalism\n\nKemalism (), also known as Atatürkism (), or the Six Arrows (), is the founding ideology of the Republic of Turkey. Kemalism, as it was implemented by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was defined by sweeping political, social, cultural and religious reforms designed to separate the new Turkish state from its Ottoman predecessor and embrace a modernized lifestyle, including the establishment of democracy, secularism, state support of the sciences and free education, many of which were first introduced to Turkey during Atatürk's presidency in his reforms.\n\nMany of the root ideas of Kemalism began during the late Ottoman Empire under various reforms to avoid the imminent collapse of the Empire, beginning chiefly in the early 19th-century Tanzimat reforms. The mid-century Young Ottomans attempted to create the ideology of Ottoman nationalism, or Ottomanism, to quell the rising ethnic nationalism in the Empire and introduce limited democracy for the first time while maintaining Islamist influences. In the early 20th century, Young Turks abandoned Ottoman nationalism in favor of early Turkish nationalism, while adopting a secular political outlook. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, Atatürk, influenced by both the Young Ottomans and the Young Turks, as well as by their successes and failures, led the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, borrowing from the earlier movements' ideas of secularism and Turkish nationalism, while bringing about, for the first time, free education and other reforms that have been enshrined by later leaders into guidelines for governing Turkey.\n\nKemalism is a modernization philosophy which guided the transition between the multi-religious, multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire to the secular, unitary Republic of Turkey. Kemalism sets the boundaries of the social process in the Turkish Reformation. Atatürk is the founder of Kemalism, and his doctrine was implemented as state ideology even after his death. Kemalism has also sometimes been called \"Socialism peculiar to Turkey\" or \"Turkish socialism\".\n\nThere are six fundamental pillars (ilke) of the ideology: Republicanism (), Populism (), Nationalism (), Laicism (), Statism (), and Reformism (or called \"Revolutionism\", ). Together they represent a kind of Jacobinism, defined by Atatürk himself as a method of utilizing political despotism in order to break down the social despotism prevalent among the traditionally minded Turkish-Muslim population, for which he blamed foremost the bigotry of the ulema. The principles came to be recognized as unchangeable and sacrosanct.\n\nRepublicanism () in the Kemalist framework replaced the absolute monarchy of the Ottoman dynasty with the rule of law, popular sovereignty and civic virtue, including an emphasis on liberty practiced by citizens. Kemalist republicanism defines a type of constitutional republic, in which representatives of the people are elected, and must govern in accordance with existing constitutional law limiting governmental power over citizens. The head of state and other officials are chosen by election rather than inheriting their positions, and their decisions are subject to judicial review. In defending the change from the Ottoman State, Kemalism asserts that all laws of the Republic of Turkey should be inspired by actual needs here on Earth as a basic tenet of national life. Kemalism advocates a republican system as the best representative of the wishes of the people.\n\nAmong the many types of republic, the Kemalist republic is a representative, parliamentary democracy with a Parliament chosen in general elections, a President as head of state elected by Parliament and serving for a limited term, a Prime Minister appointed by the President, and other Ministers appointed by Parliament. The Kemalist President does not have direct executive powers, but has limited veto powers, and the right to contest with referendum. The day-to-day operation of government is the responsibility of the Council of Ministers formed by the Prime Minister and the other Ministers. There is a separation of powers between the executive (President and Council of Ministers), the legislative (Parliament) and the judiciary, in which no one branch of government has authority over another–although parliament is charged with the supervision of the Council of Ministers, which can be compelled to resign by a vote of no-confidence.\n\nThe Kemalist republic is a unitary state in which three organs of state govern the nation as a single unit, with one constitutionally created legislature. On some issues, the political power of government is transferred to lower levels, to local elected assemblies represented by mayors, but the central government retains the principal governing role.\n\nPopulism () is defined as a social revolution aimed to transfer the political power to citizenship. Kemalist populism not only to establish popular sovereignty but also the transfer of the social-economic transformation to realize a true populist state. However, Kemalist reject class conflict and believe national unity is above all else. To Kemalist populism envision a sociality that emphasizes work and national unity. Populism in Turkey is to create a unifying force that brings a sense of the Turkish state and the power of the people to bring in that new unity.\n\nKemalist populism is an extension of the Kemalist modernization movement, aiming to make Islam compatible with the modern nation-state. This included state supervision of religious schools and organizations. Mustafa Kemal himself said “everyone needs a place to learn religion and faith that place is a Mektep not a Madrasa\". This was intended to combat the “corruption” of Islam by the Ulema. Kemal believed that during the Ottoman period, the Ulema had come to exploit the power of their office and manipulate religious practices to their own gain. It was also feared that were education not brought under state control, unsupervised Madrasas could exacerbate the rising problem of Tarikat insularity that threatened to undermine the unity of the Turkish state.\n\nKemalist social content (populism) does not accept any adjectives placed before the definition of a nation [a nation of ...]; denies the types of national unity based on racial, religious, totalitarian and fascist ideologies. It strongly opposes any kind of authority, oppression, colonialism, imperialism, etc., against the sovereignty of the people. Sovereignty must belong solely to people without any term, condition, etc.:\n\nKemalist social content (populism) was brought against the political domination of sheiks, tribal leaders, and Islamism (Islam as a political system) of the Ottoman Empire. Initially, the declaration of the republic was perceived as \"\"Returning to the days of the first caliphs\"\". However, Kemalist nationalism aimed to shift the political legitimacy from autocracy (by the Ottoman dynasty), theocracy (based in the Ottoman Caliphate), and feudalism (tribal leaders) to the active participation of its citizenry, the Turks. Kemalist social content wanted to establish the value of Turkish citizenship. A sense of pride associated with this citizenship would give the needed psychological spur for people to work harder and achieve a sense of unity and national identity. Active participation, or the \"will of the people\", was established with the republican regime and Turkishness replacing the other forms of affiliations that were promoted in the Ottoman Empire (such as the allegiance to the different millets that eventually led to divisiveness in the Empire). The shift in affiliation was symbolized with:\n\nThe motto \"Ne mutlu Türküm diyene\" was promoted against the \"long live the Sultan,\" \"long live the Sheikh\", or \"long live the Caliph.\"\n\nThe laicism () of Kemalist ideology aims to banish religious interference in government affairs, and vice versa. It differs from the passive Anglo-American concept of secularism, but is similar to the concept of laïcité in France.\n\nThe roots of Kemalist secularism lie in the reform efforts in the late Ottoman Empire, especially the Tanzimat period and the later Second Constitutional Era. The Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state in which the head of the Ottoman state held the position of the Caliph. The social system was organized according to various systems, including the religiously-organized Millet system and Shari'ah law, allowing religious ideology to be incorporated into the Ottoman administrative, economic, and political system. This way of life is today defined as Islamism (political Islam): \"the belief that Islam should guide social and political as well as personal life\". In the Second Constitutional Era, the Ottoman Parliament pursued largely secular policies, although techniques of religious populism and attacks on other candidates' piety still occurred between Ottoman political parties during elections. These policies were stated as the reason for the countercoup of 1909 by Islamists and absolute monarchists. The secular policies of the Ottoman parliament also factored in the Arab Revolt during World War I.\n\nWhen secularism was implemented in the fledgling Turkish state, it was initiated by the abolition of the centuries-old Caliphate in March 1924. The office of Shaykh al-Islām was replaced with the Presidency of Religious Affairs (). In 1926, the Mejelle and shari'ah law codes were abandoned in favor of an adapted Swiss Civil Code and a penal code modeled on the German and Italian codes. Other religious practices were done away with, including the dissolution of Sufi orders and the penalization of wearing a Fez, which was viewed by Atatürk as a tie to the Ottoman past.\n\nAtatürk was profoundly influenced by the triumph of \"laïcité\" in France. Atatürk perceived the French model as the authentic form of secularism. Kemalism strove to control religion and transform it into a private affair rather than an institution interfering with politics, scientific and social progress. \"Sane reason,\" and \"the liberty of [one's] fellow man,\" as Atatürk once put it. It is more than merely creating a separation between state and religion. Atatürk has been described as working as if he were Leo the Isaurian, Martin Luther, the Baron d'Holbach, Ludwig Büchner, Émile Combes, and Jules Ferry rolled into one in creating Kemalist secularism. Kemalist secularism does not imply nor advocate agnosticism or nihilism; it means freedom of thought and independence of the institutions of the state from the dominance of religious thought and religious institutions. The Kemalist principle of laicism is not against moderate and apolitical religion, but against religious forces opposed to and fighting modernization and democracy.\n\nAccording to the Kemalist perception, the Turkish state is to stand at an equal distance from every religion, neither promoting nor condemning any set of religious beliefs. Kemalist, however, has called for not only separation of church and state but also a call for the state control of the Muslim religious establishment. For some Kemalists, this means that the state must be at the helm of religious affairs, and all religious activities be under the supervision of the state. This in turn drew criticism by the religious conservatives. Religious conservatives were vocal in rejecting this idea, saying that to have a secular state, the state can’t control the activities of religious institutions. Despite their protest, this policy was officially adopted by the 1961 constitution.\n\nKemalism must stamp out the religious element within society. After the Turkish independence of the western powers all education was under the control of the state in both secular and religious schools. They centralized the education system with one curriculum in both religious and secular public school in hope this would eliminate or lessen the appeal of religious schools. The laws were meant to abolish the religious order called Tarikats. Titles like Shirk and dervish were abolished, and their activities banned by the government. The day of rest was changed by the government from Friday to Sunday. But the restrictions on personal choice extended to both religious duty and naming. Turks had to adopt a surname and are not allowed to make a pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nThe Kemalist form of separation of state and religion sought the reform of a complete set of institutions, interest groups (such as political parties, unions, and lobbies), the relationships between those institutions, and the political norms and rules that governed their functions (constitution, election law). The biggest change in this perspective was the abolishment of the Ottoman Caliphate on March 3, 1924, followed by the removal of its political mechanisms. The article stating that \"the established religion of Turkey is Islam\" was removed from the constitution on April 10, 1928.\n\nFrom a political perspective, Kemalism is anti-clerical in that it seeks to prevent religious influence on the democratic process, which was a problem even in the largely secular politics of the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire, when even non-religiously affiliated political parties like the Committee of Union and Progress and the Freedom and Accord Party feuded over matters such as the Islamic piety of their candidates in the Ottoman elections of 1912. Thus, in the Kemalist political perspective, politicians cannot claim to be the protector of any religion or religious sect, and such claims constitute sufficient legal grounds for the permanent banning of political parties.\n\nThe Ottoman social system was based on religious affiliation. Religious insignia extended to every social function. Clothing identified citizens with their own particular religious grouping; headgear distinguished rank and profession. Turbans, fezes, bonnets, and head-dresses denoted the sex, rank, and profession — both civil and military — of the wearer. Religious insignia outside of worship areas was banned.\n\nWhile Atatürk considered women's religious coverings as antithetical to progress and equality, he also recognized that headscarves were not such a danger to the separation of church and state to warrant an outright ban. But the Constitution was amended in 1982, following the 1980 coup by the Kemalist-leaning military, to prohibit women's use of Islamic coverings such as headscarves at higher education institutions. Joost Lagendijk, a member of the European Parliament and chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Turkey, has publicly criticized these clothing restrictions for Muslim women, whereas the European Court of Human Rights ruled in numerous cases that such restrictions in public buildings and educational institutions do not constitute a violation of human rights.\n\nReformism or \"Revolutionism\" () is a principle which calls for the country to replace the traditional institutions and concepts with modern institutions and concepts. This principle advocated the need for fundamental social change through revolution as a strategy to achieve a modern society. The core of the revolution, in the Kemalist sense, was an accomplished fact. In a Kemalist sense there is no possibility of return to the old systems because they were deemed backward.\n\nThe principle of revolutionism went beyond the recognition of the reforms made during Atatürk's lifetime. Atatürk's reforms in the social and political life are accepted as irreversible. Atatürk never entertained the possibility of a pause or transition phase during the course of the progressive unfolding or implementation of the revolution. The current understanding of this concept can be described that active modification. Turkey and its society, taking over institutions from Western Europe, must add Turkish traits and patterns to them and adapt them to the Turkish culture, according to Kemalism. The making of the Turkish traits and patterns of these reforms takes generations of cultural and social experience (which results in the collective memory of the Turkish nation).\n\nNationalism (): The Kemalist revolution aimed to create a nation state from the remnants of the multi-religious and multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire. Kemalist nationalism originates from the social contract theories, especially from the principles advocated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his Social Contract. The Kemalist perception of social contract was effected by the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire which was perceived as a product of failure of the Ottoman \"\"Millet\"\" system and the ineffective Ottomanism. Kemalist nationalism, after experiencing the Ottoman Empire's breakdown into pieces, defined the social contract as its \"highest ideal\".\n\nKemalist ideology defines the \"Turkish Nation\" () as a nation of Turkish People who always love and seek to exalt their family, country and nation, who know their duties and responsibilities towards the democratic, secular and social state governed by the rule of law, founded on human rights, and on the tenets laid down in the preamble to the constitution of the Republic of Turkey. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk defines the Turkish Nation by saying\n\nKemalist criteria for national \"identity\" or simply being Turkish () refers to a shared language, and/or shared values defined as a common history, and the will to share a future. Kemalist ideology defines the \"Turkish people\" as:\n\nMembership is usually gained through birth within the borders of the state and also the principle of jus sanguinis. Kemalist form of nationality is integrated to the Article 66 of the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey. Every citizen is recognized as a Turk, regardless of ethnicity, belief, and gender, etc. Turkish nationality law states that he or she can be deprived of his/her nationality only through an act of treason.\n\nIn 2005, the Article 301 of the Turkish Penal code made it a crime to insult Turkishness (), but under pressure of the EU, this was changed in 2008 to protect the \"Turkish nation\" instead of Turkish ethnicity in 2008, an 'imagined' nationhood of people living within the National Pact () borders.\n\nKemalist nationalism believes in the principle that the Turkish state is an indivisible whole comprising its territory and people, which is defined as the \"unity of the state\". It is a concept of nationalism which respects the right to independence of all other nations.\n\nKemalism had not only displaced \"Pan-Turkism\" as the official state ideology; it also focused on the nation-state's narrower interests, renouncing the concern for the \"Outside Turks\".\n\nPan-Turkism was an ethnocentric ideology [to unite all ethnically Turkic nations] while Kemalism is polycentric [united under a \" common will\"] in character. Kemalism wants to have an equal footing among the mainstream world civilizations. Pan-Turkists have consistently emphasized the special attributes of the Turkic peoples, and wanted to unite all of the Turkic peoples. Kemalism wants an equal footing (based on respect) and does not aim to unite the people of Turkey with all the other Turkic nations. Most Kemalists were not interested in Pan-Turkism and from 1923 to 1950 (the single state period) reacted with particular firmness.\n\nKemalism had not only displaced \"Turanism\" as the official state ideology; it also focused on the Turkish People, within the alive and historical cultures and peoples of Anatolia [an Anatolian-centered view].\n\nTuranism centered the nation as the union of all Turanian peoples (Tungus, Hungarians, Finns, Mongols, Estonians and Koreans) stretching from the Altai Mountains in Eastern Asia to the Bosphorus. Kemalism had a narrower definition of language which wanted to remove [purify] the Persian, Arabic, Greek, Latin, etc. words from the language used in Anatolia. Turanian leaders, such as Enver Pasha, wanted an evolving language common to all Turanian peoples, minimizing differences and maximizing similarities between them.\n\nRegarding expansionism, Kemalist nationalism opposes imperialism and aims to promote \"peace\" in both the domestic and the international arenas. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk wrote in 1930:\n\nStatism (): Kemal Atatürk made clear in his statements and policies that Turkey's complete modernization was very much dependent on economic and technological development. The principle of Kemalist Statism is generally interpreted to mean that the state was to regulate the country's general economic activities and engage in areas where private enterprises are not willing to do so. This was the result of post-revolutionary Turkey needing to redefine the relationship between societal and international capitalism. The revolution left Turkey in ruins as the Ottoman empire was focused on raw materials and was an open market in the international capitalist system. Post-revolutionary Turkey is largely defined by its agricultural society which includes many landlords and merchant. The control of people in the Turkish economy is quite evident from 1923 to 1930s but they still managed, through foreign joint investment, to establish a state economic enterprise. However, after the 1930s depression, there was a shift to more inward-looking development strategies during an era generally referred to as etatism. During this era, the state had an active involvement in both capital accumulation and investment as well as taking the interest of private businesses into consideration. The state often stepped into economic areas that the private sector did not cover, either due to not being strong enough or having failed to do so. These were often infrastructure projects and power stations but also iron and steel industries, while the masses shouldered the burden of the capital accumulation.\n\nThe Republican People's Party (CHP) was established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk on September 9, 1923, not long before the declaration of the Republic of Turkey on October 29. The Republican People's Party did not attempt to update or define the philosophical roots of it party Kemalism from the 1940s to the 1960s. However, since the 1960s, there has being a move to the left-of-center. The supporter of the left-of-center accepts the tented of the Kemalism also entrained the idea that structural changes brought forth by the government are necessary for modernization. Later in the 1970s, the CHP had to make fundamental changes to its party platform as the country Abandonment of Kemalism. The party thought several programs as being labeled the democratic left. Most still believe in the six principles of Kemalism while others seek to reduce the role of etatism in Turkish society.\n\nThe six principles were solidified on 5 February 1937, 14 years after establishment of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nIn the 1924 Constitutional Law Article 2, Clause 1:\n\nBoth the military coup of 1960 and the military coup of 1980 were followed by fundamental revisions of the Turkish Constitution. The texts of the new constitutions were approved by popular referendum in each case.\n\nIn the 1961 Constitutional Law Article 1, Clause 1 states \"The Turkish State is a Republic.\" Article 2, Clause 1:\n\nIn the 1982 Constitutional Law Article 1, Clause 1 states \"The Turkish State is a Republic.\" Article 2, Clause 1:\n\nOnly the principles of secularism, nationalism and democracy were maintained in each change to the constitution. The 1961 Constitution more strongly emphasized human rights, the rule of law, and the welfare state than the original 1924 constitution, while the 1982 constitution focused on the peace of the community and national solidarity, but also explicitly referenced some of Atatürk's principles and included them as well.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Turkey's domestic transformations and the evolution of the Kemalist system of ideological and political principles were closely observed in Germany, France, Britain, the USA, and beyond, including several nations farther East. In recent years, scholarly interest in the transnational history of Kemalism has expanded. Some scholars have focused on the interwar period in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Egypt to reveal how, as a practical tool, Kemalism was relocated as a global movement, whose influence is still felt today. Some scholars have examined the impact of Atatürk’s reforms and his image on the Jewish community in British-ruled Palestine before the establishment of Israel, some went farther East—to Persia, Afghanistan, China, India, and other parts of the Muslim world—to assess the influence wielded by Mustafa Kemal and his modernization project. These works explore perceptions of Kemalism that are mostly positive in their respective countries providing few critical insights into Kemalism’s evolution and its reception as an ideological project. \nAgainst this background, one of the critical partners of Turkey in the interwar period – the Soviet Union, its leaders, Communist Party functionaries, journalists and scholars initially interpreted Kemalism as an ideological ally in the struggle against the West. Since the late 1920s until the 1950s, Kemalism was viewed negatively by the Communists. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Soviet position returned to normalization. Views and analyses of Soviet leaders, diplomats, Communist party functionaries, and scholars helps us grasp the underlying dynamics behind these changing attitudes. Placing them in the larger context of republican history—delineating phases in the Kemalist paradigm of development and discerning its various rises and falls—will enrich our knowledge of the transnational history of Kemalism.\n"}

It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas the Miracle-Worker. It is situated at south of the district of Pechatniki between the Moscow river and the Lublino railroad classification yard.\n\nThe abbey was first mentioned in the city records in 1623, although it is believed that it had existed for more than a century prior to that. Its name (from the Russian verb \"to interrupt\") is explained by the fact that the Moskva River has repeatedly changed its flow at this place. The abbey began to expand in the mid-17th century and grew especially large at the turn of the century, when Patriarch Adrian made the cloister his summer residence and built the so-called Old Katholikon (1696–1700). In 1775, they opened a theological seminary on the premises of the monastery. Its main sources of income were Sukharev Tower, Iverskaya Chapel and other sketes, attached to it by the ecclesiastic authorities. \nIn 1908, the vast New Katholikon was consecrated to the Holy Icon \"Our Lady of Iberia\". The abbey was closed down in 1928. The Russian Orthodox Church resumed divine service in the Old Katholikon in 1991.\n\n"}

It is a major stop on the London–Aylesbury line from via Amersham. It is from Aylesbury to Marylebone. A branch line from on the Chiltern Main Line terminates at the station. It was the terminus for London Underground's Metropolitan line until the service was cut back to Amersham in 1961. The station was also known as Aylesbury Town under the management of British Railways from until the 1960s.\n\nThe first station on the site was opened in 1863 by the Wycombe Railway, which in 1867 was taken over by the Great Western Railway. In 1868 the Aylesbury & Buckingham Railway (later part of the Metropolitan Railway) reached Aylesbury.\n\nWhen opened, the line to Aylesbury from Princes Risborough was broad gauge. To avoid mixed gauge track when the standard gauge Aylesbury and Buckingham arrived at the station in 1868, the section to Princes Risborough was converted to standard gauge, and therefore until the rest of the Wycombe Railway was converted in 1870 there was no access to the rest of the GWR system. The GWR provided motive power and trains to both the Wycombe Railway and the A&B, and ran a shuttle service from Princes Risborough to Verney Junction.\n\nA broad gauge single-road engine shed was provided from the station's opening in 1863; the shed was doubled in length within a year or two, and in 1870 became a two-road shed with a lean-to added to the east side of the original shed. By 1892, with the arrival of the Metropolitan Railway, the shed was converted to a north-light two-road shed using the west wall of the original broad gauge shed and the east wall of the 1870 extension.\n\nThe Metropolitan Railway opened from Chalfont Road in 1892 to a separate station named Aylesbury (Brook Street) adjacent to the GWR station. It closed in 1894 when services were diverted to the GW station. The Great Central Railway reached Aylesbury in 1899 from Annesley Junction just north of Nottingham on its London extension line to .\n\nBecause the station had been a terminus for the Metropolitan Railway the original junction layout on the route to London Marylebone included a sharp curve. This became inconvenient once some Great Central trains began to run non-stop through Aylesbury from 1899 onwards. Rather than change the junction layout to suit faster trains, a speed restriction was applied to the curve.\n\nOn 23 December 1904 at about 3:38 a.m. this curve was the site of the Aylesbury Railway Disaster. The 2:45 a.m. Great Central express newspaper train from London Marylebone consisting of a locomotive, tender, and ten vehicles—three coaches, an assortment of six fish, meat and parcel vans, and a brake van—failed to slow for the curve, and was completely derailed. The locomotive, tender, and the first three or four vehicles mounted the \"down\" platform of the station, two vehicles mounted the \"up\" platform, and the rest of the train was smashed to pieces and scattered over a distance of between the two platforms. The driver of the train, Joseph Barnshaw was seriously injured and died the next day. The fireman George Masters was killed as also were London-based driver David Summers and fireman Josiah Stanton who were travelling as passengers in the first coach on their way to , Manchester.\n\nThere was heavy fog at the time of the accident, and at the subsequent Board of Trade inquiry there was some doubt as to how well driver Barnshaw knew the route. What the inquiry did not touch on was that there had been a history of fast running of these newspaper trains, which had become an important traffic for the Great Central Railway. This dated back to the Boer War which had ended only two years earlier. The \"Manchester Guardian\"s stance on the Boer War had resulted in significant drops in circulation. London newspapers, led by the \"Daily Mail\", saw a significant business opportunity in the Manchester area, and sought to get their morning newspapers to Manchester in time to win a share of this market. These trains recorded fast times for the era, including an authenticated timing of 220 minutes for the journey including stops.\n\nAfterwards in 1908 the station was reconstructed and tracks at the curve were realigned.\n\nThe original station had one platform with a brick-built station building a canopy projected from the building over the platform supported on cast iron pillars. The cost of the station building was shared between the Wycombe Railway and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway; the original plans are in Aylesbury local records office.\n\nThe current station buildings date from 1926, when the station was extensively rebuilt again—this time by the London and North Eastern Railway. Until nationalisation in 1948, Aylesbury station was operated by a joint committee whose constituents were also joint committees: the GWR & GCR Joint and the Metropolitan and GCR Joint; although the LNER had taken on the role of the former Great Central Railway in all three joint committees, these committees were not renamed.\n\nThe Wycombe Railway opened a single-road engine shed fifty feet in length to the west of the station in 1863. This was extended to the rear shortly after and enlarged to a two-road shed by the Great Western Railway in 1871, around 1893 the saw tooth roof was added on the original walls; it was closed on 16 June 1962 and was demolished in 1967.\n\nA wooden water tank was positioned outside the locomotive shed from the station's opening, being replaced by a standard GWR water tank with decorative supports and coaling stage underneath in 1899; this itself was replaced by a Braithwaite tank in the mid-1950s.\n\nThe first mention of a locomotive at Aylesbury was of the broad-gauge loco \"Giraffe\" in 1863, a member of the Sun class.\n\nUntil 1966 Aylesbury was an intermediate station on the former Great Central Main Line between London Marylebone and and on to Manchester London Road via the Woodhead Tunnel. Aylesbury was also on the Metropolitan Railway (later Metropolitan line) and through trains from Baker Street to operated until 1936. From 1948 to 1961 Aylesbury was the terminus of the Met's main line, on which trains had to change between electric and steam locomotives at Rickmansworth. Following electrification from Rickmansworth to Amersham, Aylesbury was no longer served by London Underground trains. In 1966 British Railways closed the Great Central Main Line north of Aylesbury. Aylesbury was thus left with commuter services to London only. From the 1960s until the 1980s, passenger trains at Aylesbury were almost exclusively operated by British Rail Class 115 diesel multiple units.\n\nBy the 1980s the lines serving Aylesbury were in a poor state. Aylesbury station itself was run down and needed refurbishment. Network SouthEast decided to refurbish the lines out of Marylebone, and Aylesbury received a new waiting room, new toilets and better lighting. Platform 4 was closed and the car park was extended. A new driver's staff room was established on platform 3 and a new heavy maintenance depot was built just north of the station. Aylesbury became the headquarters of the operational side of the Chiltern Line. (\"For more information, see: Chiltern Line Modernisation\")\n\nOn 14 December 2008 of the line north of Aylesbury was reopened for passenger service, with regular passenger services running north of the station for the first time since 1966. This serves the new station, which is situated on the northwestern outskirts of Aylesbury and is operated by Chiltern Railways.\n\nAylesbury station is laid out for through traffic, with hourly trains to/from Aylesbury Vale Parkway and waste freight trains to the landfill site at Calvert heading north. On selected days, usually bank holidays, special passenger services run to the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at . In addition there is a major repair and maintenance depot just north of the station, and several sidings.\n\nThere are three platforms. Platform 3 gives access to Amersham and London Marylebone only, whilst platform 1 gives access to Princes Risborough and London Marylebone via only. Platform 2 can serve both routes. There used to be a bay platform (platform 4) that served as the terminus for Metropolitan trains and several freight sidings but the car park now lies on the trackbed and bike racks occupy the platform. The goods depot was to the west of the station and was demolished in the 1960s. Modern apartments now occupy the site.\n\nThe station is managed by Chiltern Railways, which has recently had automatic ticket gates installed. There are two FastTicket self-service ticket machines accepting cash and cards, a permit to travel machine and two ticket windows. There is a taxi rank outside the station. From 21 January 2008 the taxi rank was moved to the car park for 52 weeks as a result of major engineering work on the new Southcourt Bridge and the new Station Boulevard.\n\nSeven first generation DMUs built in the late 1950s are based at Aylesbury. These units are jointly used by Chiltern Railways and Network Rail for route learning and Sandite duties. One unit was used solely for passenger services until 2017 to and from Princes Risborough.\n\nAll three station platforms have step-free access, with access to platforms 1 and 2 via a pair of lifts.\n\nA further expansion of rail services to Bletchley and Bedford is suggested in a consultants' report written to provide regional planning guidance to Bucks County Council concerning the development of Aylesbury Vale. As part of the East West Rail plan to reinstate the Oxford-Cambridge line, these services would be extended from the current freight-only line north of Aylesbury Vale Parkway to the new line via Claydon LNE Junction and terminate at or . The Department for Transport endorsed the scheme in December 2017, with opening planned for 2024. After it is completed, rail passengers between Aylesbury and the Midlands or the North will no longer need to travel via London or Princes Risborough.\n\nAylesbury may also feature in the Croxley Rail Link project which envisages re-routing part of the London Underground Metropolitan line to . Proposals also exist to start direct rail services between Watford Junction and Aylesbury via Rickmansworth and Amersham.\n\nAll services at Aylesbury are operated by Chiltern Railways. Most services operate to London Marylebone although services can take one of two routes running via either on the London-Aylesbury line or via on the Aylesbury–Princes Risborough line and the Chiltern Main Line.\n\nThe current off-peak service is:\n\nDuring the peak hours, additional shuttle services run to and from and there are additional services to/from London via the London-Aylesbury line that do not call at some of the stations nearer London (those shared with the Metropolitan line).\n\nOn Sundays, the services on the London-Aylesbury line are reduced to 1 train per hour.\n\nDuring Bank Holidays in Spring and Summer there is a frequent shuttle service to Quainton Road.\n\nAylesbury bus station is a two-minute walk from the station. Buses, the majority of which are operated by Arriva Shires & Essex, depart to several destinations across Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Oxfordshire, including Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Milton Keynes, Oxford, Tring, Watford, Luton and Leighton Buzzard. Bus departure times are displayed on screens outside the rail station's departure lounge as well as at the bus station itself.\n\nThe Aylesbury - Princes Risborough rail link offers connections to High Wycombe, Bicester, Banbury and Birmingham. This route was greatly improved by \"Project Evergreen\" - the re-dualing and speeding-up of Marylebone - Risborough - Birmingham track and services. Since 2015 Risborough has also had access to direct Oxford trains via a new junction at Bicester Village.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1855, he joined his three brothers in Dubuque, Iowa, where they established a bank. In 1859, he organized and was elected captain of a militia company known as the \"Governor's Grays,\" which Herron offered to President-elect Abraham Lincoln in January 1861, two months prior to Lincoln's inauguration.\n\nIn April 1861, Herron was appointed captain of the 1st Iowa Volunteer Regiment. He served with Nathaniel Lyon's forces in Missouri, participating in the battles of Boonville and Wilson's Creek. In August, Herron was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 9th Iowa Volunteer Regiment and fought in the battle of Pea Ridge, where he was wounded and taken prisoner, but exchanged shortly afterwards. He received a promotion to brigadier general of volunteers for his actions in this battle, and later received the Medal of Honor. He commanded both the 2nd and 3rd Divisions of the Army of the Frontier and made a forced march of in three days to join James G. Blunt's division in western Arkansas. Herron's and Blunt's combined command engaged Thomas C. Hindman in the battle of Prairie Grove and forced the Confederates to abandon western Arkansas. For his actions at Prairie Grove, Herron was appointed major general of volunteers, becoming the youngest major general on either side at the time of his promotion.\n\nHis two divisions were consolidated to form \"Herron's Division\" which was attached to the XVII Corps.

The idea for the JamMan began with modifications Gary Hall had devised for the Lexicon PCM-42 that allowed him to play into a long, looping delay whose clock could be synchronized to an external source. (Hall, who worked for Lexicon in two different periods, was the primary architect of the PCM41 and PCM42, as well as the non-reverberation effects that first appeared in the 224X and became better known in the PCM70.) Bob Sellon extended the concept considerably, starting with elaborate PCM42 modifications and eventually working with several others at Lexicon to arrive at the JamMan.\n\nThe product allowed musicians to record musical phrases at the touch of a button which were then played back, looping indefinitely. The musician would typically use the looping audio as a backing track providing a virtual backing band. The device also allowed MIDI drum machines and sequencers to be synchronized to them providing additional accompaniment. By pressing a button on the floor pedal, the device begins recording a rhythm (8 seconds of memory comes standard, but an upgraded 32-second memory chip is a common upgrade). When the musician is finished playing the part to be looped, simply press the tap button on the floor again and the machine does two things immediately: replays the part from the beginning looping it indefinitely while sending a MIDI clock signal to a drum machine which kicks in right on time and is synchronized to the rhythm part. \n\nThe JamMan is a 1U rack mounted unit that is controlled using 1 or 2 footswitches or via MIDI.\n\n\n\n"}

It is composed of six volcanoes: the oldest ones are at \"Pizzo di Corvo\", \"Monte Rivi\" and close to Capo Faro, although these are barely recognisable from a morphological point of view, while the volcano-layer of \"Monte Fossa delle Felci\" at is the highest peak in the archipelago and \"Monte dei Porri\" are both almost perfectly preserved. A lower crater lies just above sea level near the small village of Pollara, on the north west corner of the island, half of which has fallen into the sea.\n\nThe most recent eruption on Salina occurred on the western part of the island about 13,000 years ago and formed the semi-circular crater of Pollara; its activity was mainly explosive and produced large pumice deposits.\n\nAll that remains of the endogenic activities are some post-volcanic phenomena called “gurgling” and a thermal spring at Pertuso. The gurgling phenomena are at Rinella and are basically caused by the emission of underwater gas (hydrogen sulphate) and vapours. When this phenomenon is at its most active it can lift the sea-bed.\n\nFrom a distance Salina looks entirely green with two rounded high mountains and a smooth coastline. More than 400 different types of plants grow on the island and grapes, olives and capers are cultivated.\n\nSalina was the first among the Aeolian islands to protect its environment with a natural preserve, known as the \"Riserva Naturale del Fossa delle Felci e dei Porri\".\n\nThe mountainsides of the island are covered with ferns, poplars, chestnut trees and typical Mediterranean vegetation including with caper bushes, prickly pear cactus. and a variety of orchards, olive groves and vineyards. The island is particularly notable for Malvasia, a famous white wine that is only produced on Salina. It is golden in colour and has an intense, delicately sweet bouquet. There has also been a local revival of the production of superior-quality low-acid olive oil.\n\nIt is claimed that Salina produces the best capers in the world and during the first weekend of June there is an annual caper festival.\n\nA Greek settlement, from the fourth century BC through to the times of Imperial Rome, once lay on the modern-day site of the small town of Santa Marina. A number of tombs from this era have been discovered further inland. Several traces of Greek and Roman culture have been found on the island.\n\nIn the Hellenic Age the island was named \"Didyme\" (Δίδυμη), a Greek name which refers to the two mountains as \"twins\". The island was inhabited as far back as the Bronze Age and has been developed and then abandoned many times over the subsequent millennia.\n\nAreas on the island, including the two mountain peaks, were designated as a natural reserve in 1981.\n\n\nIn the 18th century the ruins of a typical Imperial Roman villa were noted here but have since sunk into the ground.\n\nSalina has two ports, Santa Marina and Rinella, served by ferries and hydrofoils. Hydrofoil service is active from Naples, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Messina and Milazzo.\n\nThere is a regular bus service connecting all the villages on the island. A main road connects Lingua, Santa Marina, Malfa and Pollara; a side road runs between the two volcanoes to Leni and Rinella.\n\nThe island was the setting of the 1970 film \"Road to Salina \" (in Italy released as \"Quando il sole scotta\" and in France as \"La route de Salina\") directed by George Lautner. Christophe's composition \"The Girl From Salina,\" written for the film's score, became a hit in Europe on its own right. The track was later used by Quentin Tarantino in his 2004 film \"Kill Bill 2\".\n\nThe 1994 Michael Radford film \"\", casting Messinese actress Maria Grazia Cucinotta, was filmed on the island of Procida and on Salina.\nSalina is also a setting in the novels Vango and it’s sequel, both by Timothée de Fombelle.\n\n\n"}

In 1635 he took part in the negotiations with Muscovy following the Smolensk War. In December 1635 he became the Deputy Crown Chancellor and Bishop of Przemyśl. Since then, his influence and wealth grew, and in 1638 he became the Great Crown Chancellor.\n\nHe was a supporter of Habsburgs, which earned him a nickname \"covert Spaniard\", and an opponent of the pro-French faction. He advocated tightening Polish control over the Commonwealth vassal, prince-elector of the Duchy of Prussia. Fighting for power and influence with magnate Jerzy Ossoliński, he became an ally of Adam Kazanowski and opponent of queen Cecilia Renata. In 1642 he lost the political battle and retired from court politics to the see of Bishop of Kraków, passing the chancery to Ossoliński. Since then, he focused mostly on religious matters, coming back into politics only in 1646 with his vocal and strong opposition of King Władysław's planned campaign against the Ottoman Empire, after which he was accused of being a traitor and exiled to the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nHe died in Racibórz on 14 July 1657.

The family farm was located north of Lloydminster, in Alberta; the eastern margin of the farm was the Alberta-Saskatchewan boundary.\n\nHe attended the University of Saskatchewan with scholarships awarded by the Standard Oil Company and the National Research Council, graduating with a B.Sc. in 1952 and a M.Sc. in physics in 1954. Some of his early work was conducted with Harold E. Johns, a pioneer in cobalt-60 radiotherapy. Till proceeded to Yale University, where he received a Ph.D. in biophysics in 1957. He then became a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Toronto.\n\nHarold E. Johns recruited Till to the Ontario Cancer Institute at Princess Margaret Hospital shortly after he completed his work at Yale. Subsequently, Till chose to work with Ernest McCulloch at the University of Toronto. Thus, the older physician's insight was combined with the younger physicist's rigorous and thorough nature.\n\nIn the early 1960s, McCulloch and Till started a series of experiments that involved injecting bone marrow cells into irradiated mice. They observed that small raised lumps grew on the spleens of the mice, in proportion to the number of bone marrow cells injected. Till and McCulloch dubbed the lumps 'spleen colonies', and speculated that each lump arose from a single marrow cell: perhaps a stem cell.\n\nIn later work, Till and McCulloch were joined by graduate student Andy Becker. They cemented their stem cell theory and in 1963 published their results in \"Nature\". In the same year, in collaboration with Lou Siminovitch, a trailblazer for molecular biology in Canada, they obtained evidence that these same marrow cells were capable of self-renewal, a crucial aspect of the functional definition of stem cells that they had formulated.\n\nIn 1969, Till became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.\n\nIn the 1980s Till's focus shifted, moving gradually into evaluation of cancer therapies, quality of life issues, and Internet research, including Internet research ethics and the ethics of List mining.\n\nTill holds the distinguished title of University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto.\n\nRecently, Till has been a vocal proponent of open access to scientific publications.\n\nUntil 2019, Till was an editorial member of the open access journal Journal of Medical Internet Research.\n\nTill was a founding member of the Board of Directors of the Canadian Stem Cell Foundation (no longer active).\n\n\n\n"}

It was aired also in Finland (\"Viimeiseen mieheen\") in 2007. The series did not return for a second season.\n\nThe main characters are three best friends — Adam, Bruno and Cameron — who live and work in Melbourne. Adam is newly single, having come out of a long-term relationship, and is dealing with the dating world for the first time in a long time. Cameron is the sexual predator of the group, although this role has been somewhat lessened by the fact that his ex-wife Zoe — who left when he had an affair — is now part of the group, and is becoming friends with the women he dates. Bruno is a nurse who has a habit of falling for women who don't care for him, while ignoring the many women who do. All three are discovering that, in their late twenties, they are still single and really have no idea about women whatsoever.\n\nIn keeping with the show's distinctly Melbourne feel, iconic Melbourne rock band Dallas Crane recorded a cover of \"Come See Me\", originally by The Pretty Things, for the show's theme tune.

It struggled to find an audience from the beginning, with an average Australian viewership of 750,000 weekly viewers. These low ratings occurred despite the show having \"Desperate Housewives\" as a lead in, which at the time was attracting over 2 million viewers a week.\n\nIt was thought by critics that \"Last Man Standing\" appealed only to \"inner city lefties\", unlike past successful Australian dramas such as \"Blue Heelers\" and \"All Saints\" which have more widespread demographic appeal.\n\nGiven that a full 22 episodes had been filmed before the series began airing, the Seven Network aired consistent repeats to allow the show to find an audience. Ratings didn't climb, however, and in early September, the network announced the show's cancellation. The series finale aired on 25 October. This episode ended in a cliffhanger, which - due to the show's cancellation - will remain unresolved.\n\nThe series began its airing in the UK on the FX channel in early 2006.\n\nThe series began its airing in Finland on the Sub (formerly known as Subtv) channel in June 2007.\n\n\n"}

In 1971, he received a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago. The title of his PhD dissertation was \"Costs and social benefits of agricultural research in Mexico\".\n\nFrom 1968 until 1970 and 1973 until 1978, Barletta was one of General Omar Torrijos's trusted advisers as minister of planning and economic policy, president of the national banking commission and member of Panama's negotiation team on economic aspects, for the Panama Canal treaties. From 1978 to 1984, he was World Bank vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean. In late 1983, he was approached by President Ricardo de la Espriella about running for president as de la Espriella's successor.\n\nIn February 1984, President Ricardo de la Espriella unexpectedly resigned the office and was succeeded by his vice president, Jorge Illueca, who did not enter the race for a full term. Ardito Barletta ran as the coalition candidate backed by the National Guard, and his candidacy had the support of the government. Opposing Ardito Barletta and the Unión Nacional Democrática (UNADE) coalition was the Democratic Opposition Alliance (Alianza Democrática de Oposición, or ADO) and its candidate, the 82-year-old veteran politician Arnulfo Arias, who had previously been president three times, each time being ousted from office by a military coup. \n\nThe election was the country's first after 16 years of military rule, something that had been agreed to during US negotiations that led to the signing of the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977. Ardito Barletta was among the negotiators for Panama. The campaign proved to be bitterly contested, with both sides predicting victory. Arias and his backers claimed that Ardito Barletta was conducting the campaign unfairly. In addition, most of the media—television, radio stations, and newspapers—favored the government coalition. For example, only one of the country's five daily newspapers supported the ADO.\n\nVoting day on 6 May 1984 was peaceful, but violence led by Arias's supporters broke out the next day in front of the Legislative Palace, where the electoral board was meeting. One person was killed. The opposition charged that there was electoral misconduct and fraud. The candidates for congress on both sides challenged the vote count at the district level, delaying the final count. Meanwhile, both sides claimed victory. When the initial results showed Arias, who had the support of much of the opposition, on his way to a landslide victory, Noriega halted the count. After brazenly manipulating the results, the government announced that Barletta had won by a slim margin of 1,713 votes. Independent estimates suggested that Arias would have won by as many as 50,000 votes had the election been conducted fairly. More than 60,000 votes were not included in the final count. On 16 May 1984, the district results were finally tallied by the Electoral Tribunal and Ardito Barletta was declared the winner by 1,713 votes, defeating Arias. The U.S. government was aware of this manipulation, but chose not to comment on it. Noriega's rule became increasingly repressive, even as the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan began relying on him in its covert efforts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The U.S. accepted Barletta's election, and signaled a willingness to cooperate with him, despite recognizing the flaws in the election process. \n\nArias's platform emphasized the need to reduce the influence of the military in Panamanian politics. Ardito Barletta's platform emphasized the reestablishment of democracy, economic development, and honest and efficient government. The US government declared that Ardito Barletta's victory must be seen as an important forward step in Panama's transition to democracy.\n\nArdito Barletta, a strait-laced and soft-spoken technocrat, took office on 11 October 1984. In his inaugural address, the newly elected president pledged to repair the economy, fight corruption, and unite Panama's political parties. He quickly launched an attack on the country's economic problems and sought help from multilateral institutions to support an economic restructuring program. He promised to modernize the government's bureaucracy and implement an economic program that would generate a 5% annual growth rate.\n\nOn 13 November 1984, to meet the IMF's requirements for a US$603 million loan renegotiation, Ardito Barletta announced economic austerity measures, including a 7% tax on all services and reduced budgets for cabinet ministries and autonomous government agencies, including the Defense Forces. In response to massive protests and strikes by labor, student, and professional organizations, he revoked some of those measures ten days later. Ardito Barletta's headstrong administrative style also offended Panamanian politicians, who had a customary backslapping and backroom style of politicking. During his tenure, the Defense Forces promised support to his program but effectively undermined the negotiations Ardito Barletta was pursuing with industrialists, labor leaders, and other business groups to achieve some economic reforms.\n\nWhile Ardito Barletta was visiting New York City, government critic Hugo Spadafora was found brutally murdered and decapitated. Spadafora had revealed that he had evidence linking Noriega to drug trafficking and illegal arms dealing. Relatives of Spadafora claimed that witnesses had seen him in the custody of Panamanian security forces near the Costa Rica border immediately before his decapitated body was found on 14 September 1985. Ardito Barletta promised to bring the killers to justice and recommended an independent commission to investigate the crime. At a meeting at Defense Forces Headquarters between Ardito Barletta and the commanders, serious discrepancies arose, leading to Ardito Barletta's resignation on 27 September 1985, after only eleven months in office. Ardito Barletta was succeeded the next day by his first vice president, Eric Arturo Delvalle, who announced a new cabinet on 3 October 1985.\n\nThe ousting of Ardito Barletta is considered to have been the beginning of the end for Noriega; Ardito Barletta had been considered the best hope for a transition to democracy by Washington. Within four years, Noriega had been thrown out of office by American military intervention.\n\nLater on, Ardito Barletta was General Administrator of the Interoceanic Region Authority (ARI) from 1995 to 2000, an agency in charge of receiving, administrating, planning, and incorporating the former Canal Zone to national development.

The House of Representatives consists of 400 members coming from 204 legislative districts across the state, created from divisions of the state's counties. On average, each legislator represents about 3,300 residents.\n\nDistricts vary in number of seats based on their populations, with the least-populous districts electing only one member and the most populous electing 11. In multi-member districts, voters are allowed to cast as many votes as there are seats to be filled; for instance, in a two-member district, a voter can vote for up to two candidates. This system of plurality block voting often results in one party winning all of the seats in the district, as the (cross-sectional) results below for the current representation attest.\n\nUnlike in many state legislatures, there is no single \"aisle\" to cross per se, as members of both parties sit partially segregated in five sections. The seat section and number is put on the legislator's motor vehicle license plate, which they pay for if they wish to put one on their personal automobiles, or in the case of the chairpersons and party leaders, their title is put on the legislative plate. Seating location is enforced, as seating is pre-assigned, although the personal preference of the legislator is asked, usually chairmen and those with special needs are given the preferred aisle seats. The sixth section is the Speaker's seat at the head of the hall.\n\nThe House of Representatives has met in Representatives Hall of the New Hampshire State House since 1819. Representatives Hall is thus the oldest chamber in the United States still in continuous legislative use. Large arched windows line the walls. On the rostrum hang portraits of John P. Hale, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin Pierce, and Daniel Webster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Secretary for the Civil Service (SCS) is one of the Principal Officials appointed under the Accountability System and a Member of the Executive Council. He heads the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) of the Government Secretariat and is responsible to the Chief Executive (CE) for civil service policies as well as the overall management and development of the civil service. His primary role is to ensure that the civil service serves the best interests of the community and delivers various services in a trustworthy, efficient and cost effective manner. The CSB assumes overall policy responsibility for the management of the civil service, including such matters as appointment, pay and conditions of service, staff management, manpower planning, training, and discipline.\n\nAppointments to the civil service are based on open and fair competition. Candidates have to go through competitive appointment processes and are appointed only if they possess the qualifications and capabilities required for the job. Vacancies can be filled by promotion from within the service. In the case of basic ranks or where promotion is not possible or where there is a special need, vacancies are filled by open recruitment. To achieve the target of reducing the civil service establishment, the Government implemented a general recruitment freeze to the civil service with effect from 1 April 2003, with exemption granted only on very exceptional circumstances. Entry requirements for civil service posts in general are set on the basis of academic or professional qualifications obtainable from local institutions or professional bodies (or equivalent), technical skills, work experience, language proficiency and other qualities and attributes as required. To achieve the aim of a civil service which is biliterate (Chinese and English) and trilingual (generally conversant in spoken Cantonese, English and Mandarin), language proficiency in Chinese and English is also required. From January 2003 onwards, for civil service posts requiring degree or professional qualifications, applicants should pass the two language papers (Use of Chinese and Use of English) in the Common Recruitment Examination before job application. For civil service posts with general academic qualifications set below degree level, applicants should attain at least Grade E in Chinese and English (Syllabus B) in the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination, or equivalent. In accordance with the Basic Law, new recruits appointed on or after 1 July 1997 must be permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, save for certain specified exceptions.\n\nOfficers are promoted on the criteria of character, ability, experience and prescribed qualifications. All eligible officers are considered on an equal basis. The officer selected for promotion must be the most meritorious one who is able and ready to perform duties at a higher rank.\n\nThe commission is an independent statutory body responsible for advising the CE on civil service appointment, promotion and disciplinary matters. In practice, the advice is rendered to the SCS and the CSB deals with the commission on individual cases. The chairman and members of the commission are appointed by the CE. The commission seeks to ensure the impartiality and fairness in appointments to the civil service and also advises on discipline matters. In accordance with the Public Service Commission Ordinance, advice of the commission has to be sought for appointment or promotion of officers to middle and senior ranking posts (excluding the disciplined ranks of the Hong Kong Police Force). The commission is also consulted on changes in appointment procedures applicable to civil service posts.\n\nThree independent bodies advise the Government on matters relating to pay and conditions of service. Their members are selected from outside the Government.\n\nThe objective of civil service pay is to offer sufficient remuneration to attract, retain, and motivate staff of suitable calibre to provide quality service to the public. Both civil servants and the general public should view the pay for civil service fair. Broad Comparability with the private sector is important when considering the pay for the civil servants.  This pay principle was sourced from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service in 1953. In 1965, the Commission further suggested that the principle of fair comparison should be weighted the most among all other considerations, including internal relatives, which is being emphasised too much in the past, commented by the Task Force on the HKSAR Civil Service Pay System.\n\nJob-related training is arranged by departments while induction and grade-specific management training are generally provided by respective grade management. The CSB provides training and development support to departments through its Civil Service Training and Development Institute. There are four core service areas: senior executive development, national studies programmes, human resources management consultancy service and promotion of a continuous learning culture. Senior executive development programmes include leadership development and national studies programmes for directorate and potential directorate officers. Advisory services on Human Resources Development (HRD) and succession planning are also provided. National studies programmes include courses at Mainland institutes such as the National School of Administration, Foreign Affairs University, Tsinghua University and Peking University. There are also local programmes on national affairs and the Basic Law, as well as staff exchange programme with the Mainland. An e-learning portal, the Cyber Learning Centre Plus is intended to promote a continuous learning culture. The Institute also disseminates best practices in HRD through its advisory services in training needs analysis, learning strategies, development of competency profiles, and performance management systems.\n\nThrough the performance appraisal process, staff at different levels are made aware of the standard of performance expected of them. Management of the process helps maximise individual performance and enhance the corporate efficiency and effectiveness of the civil service as a whole. As an integral part of the overall human resource management functions, it is a major tool in human resource planning (e.g. succession planning), development (e.g. training and job rotation), and management (e.g. confirmation, promotion, posting and disciplinary action). Performance appraisal of staff is an ongoing process. Appraisal reports are normally completed annually. Transparency and objectivity of the appraisal process are also emphasised. To improve the system, department management is encouraged to put in place assessment panels to undertake levelling and moderating work among appraisal reports, identify under-performers/outstanding performers for appropriate action, adopt other management tools including target-based assessment and core competencies assessment. The Long and Meritorious Service Travel Award Scheme, the Long and Meritorious Service Award Scheme and the Retirement Souvenir Scheme provide additional rewards. A commendation system also exists to give recognition to exemplary performance.\n\nDisciplinary action may be taken against an act of misconduct to achieve a punitive, rehabilitative and deterrent effect.\n\nThere is both a central and a departmental staff consultative machinery. Centrally, there are the Senior Civil Service Council, the Model Scale 1 Staff Consultative Council, the Police Force Council, and the Disciplined Services Consultative Council. Through these channels, the Government consults its staff on any major changes, which affect their conditions of service. At the departmental level, there are Departmental Consultative Committees which aim to improve co-operation and understanding between management and staff through regular exchanges of views. There are established channels to deal with staff grievances and complaints. Individual members of staff with problems can receive counselling, advice and help. A Staff Suggestions Scheme is run by both the CSB and departments to encourage staff to make suggestions for improving the efficiency of the civil service. Awards are given to those whose suggestions are found useful. A Staff Welfare Fund caters for the interests of staff. A Staff Relief Fund provides assistance to meet unforeseen financial needs to staff.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her drawings and prints of leading cultural figures, dancers and musicians in action, such as Francis Bacon, Mikhail Baryshnikov, T. S. Eliot and Igor Stravinsky.\n\nMilein Cosman was born in Gotha, Germany, in 1921 but spent most of her childhood in Düsseldorf. Because of her Jewish background and the rise of National Socialism, she went to school in Switzerland, at the Ecole d'Humanité and the International School of Geneva between 1937 and 1939. She came to England in 1939.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1942, Cosman studied at the Slade School of Art. The Slade was located in Oxford during the war years and there Cosman studied drawing under Randolph Schwabe and lithography under Harold Jones. In 1943 she attended evening classes at Oxford Polytechnic, where she was taught by Bernard Meninsky. In the same year she started teaching French and Art at a convent school as well as giving lectures on Art for the Workers' Educational Association (WEA).\n\nIn 1946, Cosman moved to London. She began book illustration and working as a freelance artist, while continuing to teach evening classes for the WEA and working for the American Broadcasting Station in Europe. She contributed drawings to national and international magazines and newspapers, including the BBC’s \"Radio Times\". Particularly noteworthy is a commission from \"Heute\" to draw Konrad Adenauer's post-war cabinet in Germany 1949.\n\nIn 1947, Cosman met the Viennese-born musician, writer, broadcaster and teacher Hans Keller (1919-1985), whom she married in 1961. Some books of his writings – \"The Jerusalem Diary\" (2001), \"Stravinsky The Music Maker\" (2010) and \"Britten\" (2013), for example – include many of her drawings and prints.\n\nMilein Cosman made a series of schools programmes on drawing for ITV in 1958. In all, she has had nearly 30 solo exhibitions in the UK and abroad and her work has been acquired by many leading museums including the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Ashmolean Museum, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels and the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin. She was renowned for drawing quickly, and much of her work was done from the wings or auditorium during rehearsals for concerts, theatrical and dance performances, capturing movement “in mid-flight” as Ernst Gombrich put it.\n\nIn 2006, Cosman founded the Cosman Keller Art and Music Trust, which aims to support young musicians and artists as well as publishing, exhibiting and archiving her own and Hans Keller’s work. In 2014, a documentary film on Milein Cosman made by Christoph Böll was premiered in Düsseldorf in her presence.\n\nShe died in November 2017.

{"id": "2167720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167720", "title": "Birmingham Back to Backs", "text": "Birmingham Back to Backs\n\nThe Birmingham Back to Backs (also known as Court 15) are the city's last surviving court of back-to-back houses. They are preserved as examples of the thousands of similar houses that were built around shared courtyards, for the rapidly increasing population of Britain's expanding industrial towns. They are a very particular sort of British terraced housing. This sort of housing was deemed unsatisfactory, and the passage of the Public Health Act 1875 meant that no more were built; instead byelaw terraced houses took their place. This court, at 50–54 Inge Street and 55–63 Hurst Street, is now operated as a historic house museum by the National Trust.\n\nNumerous back-to-back houses, two or three storeys high, were built in Birmingham during the 19th century. Most of these houses were concentrated in inner-city areas such as Ladywood, Handsworth, Aston, Small Heath and Highgate. Most were still in quite good condition in the early 20th century and also prior to their demolition. By the early 1970s, almost all of Birmingham's back-to-back houses had been demolished. The occupants were rehoused in new council houses and flats, some in redeveloped inner-city areas, while the majority moved to new housing estates such as Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the land where the houses are now located was owned by several families. The Inge family, after whom Inge Street is named, owned the land on the west side of the street whilst the Gooch family owned the land to the east side, where the back to backs were built. The plot of land was 50 yards long and 20 yards wide.\n\nIn 1789, Sir Thomas Gooch leased the land to John Willmore, a local toymaker. It was agreed that within a year, Willmore should construct two or more large houses at a total cost, including the outbuildings, of no less than £700. Willmore failed to do this and Court 15, as well as Court 14 adjacent, were built by his successors who remained on the street throughout the 19th century. When John Willmore died, the land was split between his sons Joseph and John Willmore, leading to the constructions looking different.\n\nCourt 14 was completed in 1802 by Joseph Willmore, a silversmith. It consisted of six front and eleven back houses with some workshops on the larger southern end of the building plot. When opened, it was known as Willmore's Court but was later renamed Court 14 Inge Street. It has since been demolished.\n\nAt this time, John Willmore, a carpenter and joiner, constructed a house and workshop for himself. By 1809, the undeveloped remainder of the plot consisted of two nailer's workshops and a cooper's workshop with a knacker's yard behind. The Hurst Street frontage was filled with sheds. By 1821, No. 50 Inge Street/ 1 Court 15 had been converted into a pair of back to backs. No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 and No. 54 Inge Street/3 Court 15 were built about 1830. The terrace along Hurst Street was constructed in 1831.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, the court was occupied by workers who worked in such industries as button making, glasswork, woodwork, leatherwork, tailoring and were also skilled craftsmen in the jewellery and small metal trades. Many of such workers worked from home. Over 500 families have lived in Court 15.\n\nFrom the 1830s to the 1930s, the Mitchells, a family of locksmiths and bellhangers, lived in the court. At one time, they were occupying both No. 55 Hurst Street and No. 54 Inge Street/3 Court 15. The family also worked at the workshop in the court for over 70 years.\n\nIn 1851, Joseph Barnett, a travelling jeweller, lived at number 35 Inge Street, with his wife Hanna, and four children, Samuel, Eli Louis, Rebecca and Henry.\n\nOther people who lived there highlight the crowded conditions of the houses, which were usually occupied by single families. In 1851, for example Sophia Hudson, a widow who worked as a pearl button driller, probably from home, lived at No. 1 Court 15 with her five children and her mother who also a widow. In 1861, Herbert Oldfield, a glass eye maker, occupied the same address with his wife and their eight children. At the same time, the Mitchell family had an apprentice who lived with them. Despite the cramped conditions, some families, such as the one who occupied 61 Hurst Street in 1851, were able to afford a servant.\n\nBy 1900, the ground floors had been converted into shops. Services offered from the buildings were a cycle maker, a hairdresser, a ticket writer, a fruiterer and a furniture dealer. The upper floors of No. 55 and No. 59 Hurst Street, the cycle maker's and the ticket writer's properties respectively, were converted into workshops as opposed to residential.\n\nMost of the buildings remained in residential use until 1966 when they were declared as unfit for habitation. This resulted in those living in the buildings being required to leave.\n\nIn 1988, the court received Grade II listed status from the Department of National Heritage. In 1995, Birmingham City Council commissioned the City of Hereford Archaeological Unit to survey and record them. Funding for this project was provided by the city council and English Heritage.\n\nThe Birmingham Back to Backs were restored by the Birmingham Conservation Trust, in collaboration with architects S. T. Walker & Duckham, and opened to the public on 21 July 2004. Their restoration was the subject of a five-part documentary by Carlton Television. Each of the four houses is decorated and furnished as if in a different era; 1840s, 1870s, 1930s and 1970s. Visits are by pre-booked, timed guided tours only.\n\nThe court consists of three pairs of back-to-back houses on Inge Street and a terrace of five blind back houses on Hurst Street, in the form of an L-shaped footprint. All the buildings are three storeys tall with one room on each floor.\n\nNo. 50 Inge Street/ 1 Court 15, the first to be constructed, is the tallest and the largest in the court. Some evidence exists to indicate that it was originally a single dwelling but it has been occupied for most of its life as a pair of back to backs. Evidence to show that it may have originally been one house is available through the layout of the attic. The attic runs across the whole depth of the pair of houses, but was never divided and can only be reached from the back house of No. 1 Court 15 where the surviving staircase is of much better quality than any remaining in the other houses in Court 15. On the second floor, there is a now-blocked doorway in the spine wall between the two houses indicating that the floors to both houses were both accessible. At this level too, No. 50 Inge Street has been split into two rooms by a partition wall. The smaller of the two rooms is unheated and lit by a casement window. There are two tall chimney stacks, one for each house, in the pair.\n\nThe tunnel entrance to the court runs between No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 and No. 54 Inge Street/ 3 Court 15. Each pair of houses shares a single chimney set on the ridge of the roof. The two back houses each have a bay window to allow more light into the ground floor room. The lower floors to these houses have been divided by two spine walls. The upper floors are divided by one spine wall.\n\nIn No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 only one original stairway remains — from the ground to the first floor in the front house. The stair in No. 54 Inge Street has been removed at ground floor level but in No. 3 Court 15 the complete staircase survives.\nThe rear entrances to Nos. 55, 57 and 59 are gained through a very narrow tunnel entry from Court 15. A staircase on the back wall of each house led up to the first and second floors. The houses were lit by windows on the Hurst Street side and heated by shared chimney stacks. No. 63 Hurst Street shared a chimney with No. 65 Hurst Street, the front house of a pair of back to backs which were part of Court 2 Hurst Street, now demolished. No. 55 Hurst Street has a large bay window at first floor level overlooking Inge Street, which is an early feature. All the houses in the terrace have late 20th century shop fronts, replacing earlier ones which were installed about 1900.\n\nCourt 15 may have originally had a water pump in the courtyard, though this is not known for certain. By the 1880s, a single tap had been installed. The brick paved yard contains an open drain running in front of the three back houses. In the 1930s, the two washhouses and water closets (outdoor flush toilets) were constructed on the site of the workshops and outbuildings in the courtyard.\n\n\n"}

His friends take him to a gypsy on 34th and Vine named Madame Ruth (Anne Bancroft). After reading his palm and seeing absolutely no romance in his life, Ruth gives him a small amount of Love Potion No. 8 on a piece of paper. As a scientist, Paul has doubts and ends up throwing it in the trash when he gets home. Around this time, Paul's friends buy him the services of Marisa, but all they do is talk.\n\nHis cat gets into the trash and eats some of the potion, then meows and attracts all the other cats in the neighborhood. When Paul sees the results, he takes it to Diane, and they find out the \"scientific\" properties of it. After analyzing it, they decide to use themselves as human test subjects. Diane ends up attracting an Italian car mogul and the prince of England, ending up getting a makeover in the process, while Paul has a string of hookups with women in bars, supermarkets, cars, sorority houses (notably Alpha Tau Omega at Georgia Institute of Technology), and female dormitories (notably Balch Hall at Cornell University).\n\nPaul and Diane realize their romantic attraction to each other and become involved. Eventually, Paul plans a proposal to Diane; however, when he comes by her house to do so, she's not there. Later, she tells him she has fallen for Gary (Dale Midkiff). (We have seen Gary before, taking advantage of her loneliness to have sex with her.) Paul is devastated and decides he really wants to get her back.\nMarisa comes to his house to steal his stereo, and after trying the potion in his bathroom, she makes Paul gladly give her all his valuables, including the potion.\n\nAfter \"waking up\" from his infatuation, Paul gets an idea, and Madame Ruth confirms that somebody looking like Gary has bought all the potion No. 8. He phones Diane to tell her Gary is using the potion on her, but Gary forbids her to talk to him. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts, Paul goes back to Madame Ruth, who gives him Love Potion No. 9, which will not create love, but remove things obscuring it (such as potion No. 8). But if Diane was never really in love with him, Paul will love her for his entire life and she will eternally hate him.\n\nPaul asks three friends to help him force Diane to take No. 9, but they can't believe him. Marisa arrives at the house and uses No. 8 to rob all of them, proving the power of the potion.\nWhen they arrive at the house, Diane's friend and matron of honor tells them Diane and Gary are marrying in an hour, but that she suspects something is wrong with Diane. Paul explains, she agrees to give Diane the potion, and things go terribly wrong, but Marisa, having tricked Gary's potion bottle from him, causes havoc and effectively ends the wedding, which gives Paul the chance to drink Potion No. 9, kiss Diane and wait five minutes as per the instructions. The effect kicks in too late but in the end, Diane runs away from Gary into Paul's arms.\n\nThe film gives a pseudoscientific explanation as to how Love Potion No. 8 \"works.\" It's explained:\n\nLove Potion No. 9 prevents love from fading, and overrides the effects of Love Potion No. 8.\n\n\n\"Love Potion No. 9\" received poor reviews from critics, as the film holds a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from a sample of 11 reviews.\n\n"}

Holliday\n\nColonel Cyrus Kurtz Holliday (April 3, 1826 – March 29, 1900) was an American railroad executive who was one of the founders of the township of Topeka, Kansas, in the mid 19th century; and was Adjutant General of Kansas during the American Civil War. The title \"Colonel\", however, was honorary. He was the first president of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, as well as one of the railroad's directors for nearly 40 years, up to 1900. A number of railway locomotives have been named after him, as well as the former town of Holliday, Kansas. He was also the Deputy Grand Master of the Grand Lodge A.F. & A.M. of Kansas. As a Freemason, he was a member of Topeka Lodge #17 and was highly influential in the decision of moving the State Capitol to the city of Topeka. \n\nHe was born on April 3, 1826, to David and Mary (Kennedy) Holliday, in Kidderminster, Pennsylvania (near Carlisle). The younger Holliday received a public school education, graduating from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he studied law, in 1852. Although he moved to Kansas in 1854, Allegheny College's alumni records show Holliday receiving a master's degree in 1855.\n\nWhile he was still in Meadville, he was asked to prepare legal documentation for a new railroad that would connect to the city. The proposed railroad (likely the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad which was sometimes known as \"The Meadville Line\") would almost connect with a larger nearby system (the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad), which meant that it could become a feeder route to the larger railroad. Holliday saw the potential of the line and instead of asking for a standard fee to create the documents, he asked for and was granted a partnership in the new railroad. When this railroad was purchased by the larger system, Holliday earned $20,000 from the sale.\n\nAfter the sale was completed, he married Mary Dillon Jones. He soon followed the many others making the migration to settle land west of the Mississippi River, but Mary stayed behind in Pennsylvania. The two were reunited later in Kansas after the births of their children, Lillie and Charles King.\n\nIn 1854 he moved to Kansas, leaving his wife behind in Pennsylvania to follow later. He first settled in Lawrence in October 1854. On December 10, 1854, after helping to find a location for the new townsite of Topeka, he wrote a letter to his wife saying:\n\nI am now thirty miles above Lawrence on the Kansas River assisting in starting a new town. We are just about in the central portion of the \"settled\" Territory and with perhaps the best landing and the most eligible site for a city in the entire country. ... So I think it must be, and in a few years when civilization by its magic influence shall have transformed this glorious country from what it is now to the brilliant destiny awaiting it, the Sun in all his course will visit no land more truly lovely and desirable than this. Here, Mary, with God's kind permission, we will make our home; and I have every reason to believe a home it will truly be.\n\nIn 1855 Holliday received the honorary title of Colonel for supervising a regiment during the Wakarusa War. He also served as the Adjutant General of Kansas during the Civil War from May 2, 1864, to March 31, 1865. Although his Colonel title was only honorary, he continued to use it long after his military service.\n\nIn 1861, Holliday served in the Kansas State Senate, and although he ran for Congress in 1874, he was defeated in that election. He was a Republican.\n\nHolliday had broad interests in developing the natural resources of Kansas. In the 1890s he became mistakenly convinced that Ellis and Trego counties in central Kansas contained mineral deposits of tin, zinc, and gold. In 1899 his son Charles K. Holliday founded Smoky Hill City, Kansas, near the supposed mineral deposits.\n\nOnce Topeka was founded, it needed transportation to connect it to the rest of the country. Holliday's legal skills were called on again to create the paperwork for a new railroad. In 1859 he singlehandedly wrote the charter for the Atchison and Topeka Railroad Company, which would connect the two cities by rail following the route of the Santa Fe Trail. Kansas Territory governor Samuel Medary approved the charter on February 11, 1859. Holliday was named a director and president of the new railroad on September 17, 1860, which was renamed in 1863 to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. During his tenure as president, Holliday secured land grants from the federal government that would soon be used by the railroad to populate the western portion of Kansas in order to build a customer base for the railroad. He stepped down from the presidency at the end of 1863, but remained on the board of directors until July 27, 1865. He rejoined the board on September 24, 1868, this time serving until his death on March 29, 1900.\n\nHolliday is buried in Topeka Cemetery, Topeka, Kansas. He is memorialized for his contributions to Kansas and the Santa Fe:\n\n"}

The resulting drink is transparent and ranges from pale to bright yellow in color, with a floral aroma. In Chinese tradition, once a pot of chrysanthemum tea has been drunk, hot water is typically added again to the flowers in the pot (producing a tea that is slightly less strong); this process is often repeated several times. Chrysanthemum tea was first drunk during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).\n\nSeveral varieties of chrysanthemum, ranging from white to pale or bright yellow in color, are used for tea.

Churchward for heavy freight work. They were the first 2-8-0 locomotive in Great Britain.\n\nThe prototype, originally numbered 97 but later renumbered 2800, appeared in 1903. Construction of the production series commenced in 1905 and continued until 1919. The 2884 Class which appeared in 1938–1942 was developed from the 2800 class and is sometimes classified with it.\n\nNo.97 undertook two years of trials before going into production. Initial results suggested that only the front end needed further development. Initially the boiler pressure of the 2-8-0 was set at with diameter cylinders. Tractive effort started out at but was increased substantially in the production engines by enlarging the cylinder diameter to and raising the steam pressure to . The piston valves were enlarged to .\n\nThe most visible difference between No.97 and the first of the 1905 production batch was the higher pitch of the boiler ( opposed to ). At first the prototype was given a tender but almost without exception the 2800s were harnessed to the variety throughout their working lives. Superheating was incorporated into the class from 1909 with No.2808 the first to be retro-fitted. Other modifications centred on improving the weight distribution, altering smokebox lengths and fitting larger diameter chimneys. \nThe 84 2800s built by Churchward remained the GWR's principal long haul freight engines throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The only serious problem met with in traffic was with the sealing of the internal steam pipes. Beginning in 1934 most of the class had them replaced with the outside kind.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1947, coal shortages caused GWR to experiment with oil fired 2800 locomotives and 12 of the 2800 class were converted. They were renumbered into the 4800 series, which necessitated re-numbering the entire 4800 class autotanks into the 1400 series, and reclassified as 1400 class. The experiment, encouraged by the government was abandoned in 1948 once the extra maintenance costs were calculated and the bill had arrived for the imported oil.\n\n\nSix 2800 class locomotives survive, these being 2807, 2818, 2857, 2859, 2873, 2874, along with nine 2884 class locomotives. A seventh survivor was used to provide parts for other projects. Only two members of the class have so far operated in preservation, these being: 2807 and 2857, currently only 2857 is operational whilst 2807 is under overhaul which began in early 2020. One of the class, no. 2857, briefly operated on the main line in 1985.\n2861, built in 1918, was one of the \"Barry Ten\" and eventually broken up for parts at the Llangollen Railway in 2014 and the frames scrapped.

Two of her sisters, Maymuna bint al-Harith and Zaynab bint Khuzayma, became wives of Muhammad.\n\nLubaba was a member of the Hilal tribe, a branch of the Banu 'Amir who were prominent in Mecca. (This tribe was distinct from the Quraysh.)\n\nHer father was Al-Harith ibn Hazan ibn Jubayr ibn Al-Hazm ibn Rubiya ibn Abdullah ibn Hilal ibn Amer ibn Saasaa Al-Hilali and her mother was Hind bint Awf ibn Zuhayr ibn Al-Harith. Lubaba had two brothers and a sister from this marriage, and her father also had three daughters by another wife, while her mother had one son by a former husband. Al-Harith died while Lubaba was still a child, and Hind then married Khuzayma ibn Al-Harith Al-Hilali. This marriage produced one daughter but was short-lived, and Hind next married Umays ibn Ma'ad Al-Khathmi, by whom she had three further children.\n\nLubaba married Abbas ibn Abd-al-Muttalib al-Hashimi, who was an uncle of Muhammad. Tabari states that Lubaba was only Abbas's concubine, but this suggestion that she was a slave is at odds with her family's middle-class status. The union produced seven children: Al-Fadl, Abdullah, Ubaydullah, Quthum, Mabad, Abdur-Rahman and Umm Habib. Abbas also had five children by other women.\n\nLubaba claimed to be the second woman to convert to Islam, the same day as her close friend Khadijah. She and her sisters were very prominent in the early Muslim community. Muhammad commented on their family effort: \"The faithful sisters are Asma and Salma, daughters of Umays, and Lubaba and Maymuna, daughters of Al-Harith.\" It is interesting that his observation did not encompass their half-sister, Zaynab bint Khuzayma, who was later to become his own wife.\n\nAbbas was still a pagan in 622, so he and Lubaba remained in Mecca when other Muslims emigrated to Medina.\n\nWhen the news of the Meccan defeat at the Battle of Badr arrived in Mecca in 624, there was general consternation; but Abbas's Muslim freedman, Abu Rafi, could not contain his joy. Abbas's brother Abu Lahab was so furious that he assaulted Abu Rafi, knocking him to the ground and then kneeling on top of him to continue beating him. Several able-bodied men witnessed or were in calling distance of this attack, but it was Lubaba who grabbed a tent-pole and cracked it across Abu Lahab’s head, asking, “Do you think it’s all right to attack him because Abbas is absent?” Abu Lahab's head was split open, exposing his skull; When he died a week later, it was said to be of an infection, ulcer, or the plague.\n\nA few months later, Lubaba was the subject of a love-song by the Jewish poet Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf.\n\nThe song is almost certainly sarcastic, as the Amir tribe were Ka'b's traditional enemies and, in his perception, the reverse of \"honourable\" or \"trustworthy\". The reference to pedlar's products in the third and fourth lines, and to wobbling flesh in the fifth and sixth, presumably indicates that Lubaba was plump, painted and middle-aged (although she was probably under thirty). \n\nAbbas officially accepted Islam just before the conquest of Mecca in 630, twenty years after his wife.\n\nLubaba died during the caliphate of Uthman.\n\n\n"}

Espriella was the general manager of National Bank of Panama from 1970 to 1978, when he became Vice President in 1978, when the all-powerful National Guard pressed then President Aristides Royo (considered a dangerous leftist) to resign before his term ended in 1984. Since de la Espriella was head of the National Finance Commission before Royos's resignation, there was a matter of his involvement with a certain insurance fraud called the \"Seguros Swindle\", which cut of his came to $115,000. Being a competent financial manager, he posed no threat to the dominant influence of the National Guard, and wasted no time in referring to them as \"a partner in power\". Thus, de la Espriella was a type of \"puppet\" president and remained so under the brutal Manuel Noriega (Panama's first Chief of Intelligence, and then Guard commander when Rubén Darío Paredes resigned that title to start his own electoral campaign).\n\nWhen de la Espriella took the oath as Interim President, the then-Commander Paredes immediately decreed that certain Panamanian papers be shut down, including \"La Prensa\", which had become the country's conscience. De la Espriella ordered certain hoodlums to attack the newspaper, smashing the windows, typewriters, the head of a pressman, and an unfortunate unintended victim – the director of the Central American Institute of Business Administration, who had just come by with a press release from his institution. His suit and tie caused him to be mistaken for the \"La Prensa\" director.\n\nIn August 1982, de la Espriella formed a new cabinet that included independents and members of the Liberal Party and the PRD; Jorge Illueca, Royo's foreign minister, became the new vice president. Meanwhile, Colonel Armando Contreras became chief of staff of the National Guard, until December 1982, when Noriega took over that position.\n\nThe country had only a \"democratic façade.\" President Ronald Reagan wrote de la Espriella a response \"thank you\" letter on \"the situation in Central America\", dated 26 July 1983, regarding a letter received by him from de la Espriella and the presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, written regarding a meeting held by the four in Cancún on July 17, 1983. Reagan's \"thank you\" also outlined 4 points the United States expected the \"Contadora Four\" (as they were called) to follow.\n\nDe la Espriella remained public and appeared in \"Time\" magazine, \"Newsweek\", and other magazines - one of which printed a 1983 photo of him sitting next to then-Vice President George H. W. Bush who sat alongside a young, uniformed Manuel Noriega. If a picture is worth a thousand words, de la Espriella not only appeared as President, but as a \"mediator\" or \"interpreter of events\" whenever Noriega hovered.\n\nBut by 1984, de la Espriella was pressured by the National Defense Forces, according to close friends, to reorganize his Cabinet to include supporters of an official candidate. Publicity speculated he stepped down in order to keep the election from being unfairly slanted, or most likely, driven out by the Forces under personal threat. In \"In the Time of Tyrants\" by R.M. Koster & Guillermo Sanchez, 1990, W.W. Norton & Co., N.Y., pages 302-303 state (not verbatim): \" ...de la Espriella was given a list of replacements for his cabinet, but balked at naming them... On February 13, he was with his family in Chiriquí Province. Noriega sent a plane to bring him to an urgent council of state in the capital at which only he and Colonel Díaz Herrera were present. Díaz Herrera talked while Noriega looked on. Why hadn't de la Espriella made the appointments? \"\"They weren't good for the country\"\", de la Espriella replied, and that was surely true...but sixteen years had passed since the good of the country had mattered a fig in the decisions of the Panamanian leaders, and that hadn't bothered de la Espriella before. So he wanted to end his term with a few scraps of dignity, but that wasn't to be and he should have known it. \"\"You should think of your family\"\", said Herrera...\"\"do you know where they are?\"\" \"\n\nRicardo de la Espriella resigned immediately.\n"}

Prince Taka's career path was somewhat unusual for the late Meiji period in several respects. First, unlike his half-brothers and other princes of that generation, he never held a commission in the military.

On his own admission, he gazed at a pretty girl on another camel so intently that Muhammad had to take his chin and turn his face away from her three times.

A total of nine episodes were planned with only the first one released. Developed by Ritual Entertainment and powered by the Source game engine, the first episode \"Emergence\" was the first computer game by a major developer to both be produced episodically and delivered over the Internet without the intervention of a publisher. This was accomplished through Valve's Steam content delivery system.\n\nIn 2007, Ritual was acquired by casual game developer MumboJumbo, stalling the franchise and leaving the future of the series uncertain. With the sale of Ritual to MumboJumbo and departure of several employees, all future development of \"Sin Episodes\" appears to be delayed indefinitely, if not entirely canceled. MumboJumbo has already tasked Ritual to develop \"high-quality casual content.\"\n\nArena Mode is a single player mode and was designed to run a contest at E3 2006 as part of a promotion alongside Vigor Gaming. In this high score mode the objective is to survive as long as possible among the steadily spawning and increasing enemies. There are time limits to the maps and it is possible to survive an entire round. The scoring system is also tied to the Personal Challenge System which runs at a much higher rate than in the main game. The challenge level changes every few seconds depending on the player's performance and the higher the challenge, the higher the rate of points that are accumulated. This mode was introduced into the game on June 26, 2006 with four maps available. An update was released on July 18, 2006 which included three further maps.\n\nFreeport City is a bustling, futuristic megacity with a population of 27,000,000 and described as a mix of New York, San Francisco, and Tokyo. Areas that are featured in \"Emergence\" include the Freeport Docks, Sintek Supremacy Tower, and Radek's hidden drugs lab on board a beached, derelict oil tanker.\n\n\nRitual's original intention was to release an episode every six months that would cost US$19.95 and take around four to six hours to complete. A total of nine episodes were envisioned. Although originally released as a single-player game, various multiplayer modes were planned including co-operative and team based modes.\n\nOne of Ritual's main design goals with \"SiN Episodes\" was to offer interactivity, character-driven gameplay, emergent AI, and a plot reflecting the choices made by players through an opt-in statistics system that aggregates play data to a database: the intention that future episodes would thus depend on the choices that are made by each player.\n\n\"SiN Episodes\" is built on the Source engine with additional technology added by Ritual.\n\n\n\"SiN Episodes: Emergence\" received generally favorable reviews and currently holds the score of 75 on Metacritic. As of January 27, 2007 the game had sold 150,000 units, enough to recoup development costs but not enough to fund a sequel.\n"}

He belonged to the Banu Ghifar, the Kinanah tribe. No date of birth is known. He died in 652 CE, at al-Rabadha, in the desert east of Medina.\n\nAbu Dhar is remembered for his strict piety and also his opposition to Muawiyah I during the caliph Uthman ibn Affan era. He is venerated by Shia Muslims as one of The Four Companions, early Muslims who were followers (Shi'a) of Ali ibn Abi Talib.\n\nHe was regarded by many, including Ali Shariati, Muhammad Sharqawi and Sami Ayad Hanna, as a principal antecedent of Islamic socialism, the first Islamic socialist, or the first socialist altogether.\nHe protested against the accumulation of wealth by the ruling class during ‘Uthmān's caliphate and urged the equitable redistribution of wealth.\n\nLittle is known of his life before his conversion to Islam. Abu Dhar is said to have been a serious young man, an ascetic and a monotheist even before he converted. He was born to the Ghifar clan, found to the western south of Medina. Abu Dhar was apparently typical of the early converts to Islam, described by Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri as \"young men and weak people\". They were a branch of the Banu Kinanah tribe. The Quraysh clan of Muhammad was also a branch of the Banu Kinanah tribe.\n\nPopular accounts of Abu Dhar say that his tribe lived by pillaging caravans, but that he preferred to live a poor but honest life as a shepherd. Having heard the contention that a new prophet had arisen in Mecca, Abu Dhar and his brother travelled to Mecca to find the prophet. The young seeker converted instantly and rushed out to declare his new faith in front of the Kaaba, which at that time was a pagan temple. He was beaten for his religious belief. He did this three days in a row, after which the Prophet Muhammad told him to return to his clan, where he taught his people about Islam. He and his tribe then joined Muhammad after the Hijra, or migration to Medina in 622 CE.\n\nMuhammad once said that \"the sky did not spread its canopy on any man who was more truthful than Abu Dharr.\"\n\nThis seems to be a simplified account of stories reported in these hadiths, , and .\n\nAccording to the early Islamic historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Abu Dhar claimed to have been the fourth or fifth convert to Islam. However, Saad bin Abi Waqqas made the same claim. While the exact order of conversion may never be established, no one doubts that he was a very early convert.\n\nHe participated in the Battle of Badr. Muhammad's forces included Abu Bakr, Umar, Ali, Hamza, Mus`ab ibn `Umair, Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, Ammar ibn Yasir, and Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. The Muslims also brought seventy camels and two horses, meaning that they either had to walk or fit three to four men per camel. However, many early Muslim sources indicate that no serious fighting was expected, and the future Caliph Uthman stayed behind to care for his sick wife Ruqayyah, the daughter of Muhammad. Salman the Persian also could not join the battle, as he was still not a free man.\n\nDuring the Expedition of Ka’b ibn 'Umair al-Ghifari his son Umair al-Ghifari was killed. In this expedition Muhammad ordered an attack on the Banu Quda‘a tribe because Muhammad received intelligence that they had gathered a large number of men to attack the Muslim positions\n\nIn response Muhammad ordered the Third Expedition of Dhu Qarad to take revenge for the killing of the son of Abu Dhar Ghifari at al-Ghaba\n\nAbu Dhar had begun his agitation in Medina after Uthman had given 500,000 dirhams to Marwan I, 300,000 to al-Harith b. al-Hakam, and 100,000 to the Medinan Zayd ibn Thabit from the \"khums\" of the booty seized in Ifriqiya in 27/647. He then quoted relevant Qur'anic passages threatening the hoarders of riches with hell-fire. Marwan complained to Uthman, who sent his servant Natil to warn Abu Dhar, but to no avail. Uthman displayed patience for some time until, in the presence of the caliph, Abu Dhar launched an angry verbal attack on Ka'ab al-Ahbar, who had backed Uthman's free use of public money. Uthman now chided Abu Dhar and sent him to Damascus.\n\nMany hadith, oral traditions, are traced to Abu Dhar. He is respected as an early and observant Muslim, and a man who was honest and direct to a fault. He was, according to the Sunni tradition, a rough, unlettered Bedouin who held no high office, but who served the Muslim community, the Ummah, with everything he had to give.\n\nDuring the caliphate of Uthman, he stayed in Damascus and witnessed Muslims deviating from Islam, going after worldly pleasures and desires.\n\nHe was saddened and repelled by this. So Uthman invited him to come to Madinah. where he was also hurt by people's pursuit of worldly goods and pleasures.\n\nAl-Rabathah\n\nAbu Dhar then asked Uthman for permission to live in al-Rabathah, a small village in eastern Madinah. Uthman approved his request. Abu Dhar stayed there away from people, holding on to the traditions (sunnah) of Muhammad and his companions.\n\nA man visited him once and when he found his house almost bare, he asked Abu Dhar: \"Where are your possessions?\"\n\nAbu Dhar said: \"We have a house yonder (meaning the Hereafter), to which we send the best of our possessions.\"\n\nThe man understood what Abu Dhar meant and said: \"But you must have some possessions so long as you are in this abode.\"\n\n\"The owner of this abode will not leave us in it,\" replied Abu Dharr.\n\nAlso, when the Prince (Amir) of Syria sent Abu Dhar three hundred dinars to meet his needs, he returned the money saying, \"Does not the Amir find a servant more deserving of it than I?\"\n\nAbu Dhar continued in his simple life, and dedicated himself to Allah only until he died, in 32 A.H.\n\nAba Dhar is considered one of the greatest and most loyal sahaba, along with Salman the Persian, Miqdad ibn Aswad, and Ammar ibn Yasir.\n\nImam Ali advanced to see him off. He said:\n\nAbu Dhar, his wife and his daughter went to al-Rabathah Desert. He was recalling our Master Muhammad's words:\nAbu Dhar, may Allah have mercy upon you. You'll live alone, die alone, rise from the dead alone and enter Paradise alone.\nProphet Mohammad said about him \"Aba Dhar is like Issa/Jesus of my nation in his \"zohod\" and \"waraa\"\n\nThere are two Shia shrines to Abu Dhar in Lebanon — in Sarepta and Meiss al-Jabal.\n\nMuhammad is reported to have said, \"Neither has the sky shaded one more truthful and honest than Abu Dhar nor has the earth had anyone walk over it like him. (In these matters) he is like Isa bin Maryam.\" (From Tirmidhi.)\n\nMuhammad also said, \"Abu Dhar walks on earth with the piety of Isa bin Maryam (Jesus, the son of Mary).\" (From Tirmidhi.)\n\nDuring the Battle of Tabouk, Abu Dhar was left behind because his camel was ill or too weak. So he alighted from it and, placing the pack on his back, walked to the rest of the army. Muhammad saw him and exclaimed, \"May Allah have Mercy on Abu Dhar!\" He then said, \"He spends his life all alone. Death will single him out and on the Day of Resurrection, he will stand up all alone!\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Theodore is the subject of an opera by G. Paisiello, \"Il re Teodoro in Venezia\" (1784, Vienna), and one of the six kings in Venice in Voltaire's \"Candide\". \n\nTheodor von Neuhoff was born in Cologne as the son of a Westphalian nobleman. Educated at the court of France, he served first in the French army and then in that of Sweden. Baron de Goertz, minister to Charles XII, realizing Neuhoff's capacity for intrigue, sent him to England, and to Spain to negotiate with Cardinal Alberoni. Having failed in this mission he returned to Sweden and then went to Spain, where he served Alberoni until his exile, then the Baron Ripperda, and was made colonel and married one of the queen's ladies-in-waiting. Deserting his wife soon afterwards he repaired to France and became mixed up in John Law's financial affairs and the Mississippi Company boom; then he led a wandering existence visiting Portugal, the Netherlands, and Italy.\nAt Genoa, Neuhoff made the acquaintance of some Corsican rebels and exiles, and persuaded them that he could free their country from Genoese tyranny if they made him king of the island. With the help of the Bey of Tunis, he landed in Corsica in March 1736 with military aid. The islanders, whose campaign had not been successful, elected and crowned him king. He assumed the title of King Theodore I, issued edicts, instituted an order of knighthood, and waged war on the Genoese, at first with some success. But in-fighting among the rebels soon led to their defeat. The Genoese put a price on his head and published an account of his colourful past, and he left Corsica in November 1736, ostensibly to seek foreign assistance. After sounding out the possibility of protection from Spain and Naples, he set off to Holland where he was arrested for debt in Amsterdam.\n\nOn regaining his freedom, Theodore sent his nephew to Corsica with a supply of arms; he himself returned to Corsica in 1738, 1739, and 1743, but the combined Genoese and French forces continued to occupy the island. After that he fled to the Netherlands again and lived some years in exile in the manor house ‘t Velde near Zutphen. There he made plans for new actions to gain power again as king of Corsica. 1749 he arrived in England to seek support, but eventually fell into debt and was confined in a debtors' prison in London until 1755. He regained his freedom by declaring himself bankrupt, making over his kingdom of Corsica to his creditors, and subsisted on the charity of Horace Walpole and some other friends until his death in London in 1756, aged 62.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes said that he married the daughter of Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan and Lady Honora Burke, his wife Catalina Sarsfield was in fact from a different branch of the Irish Catholic Sarsfield family, and was the daughter of David Sarsfield of County Limerick.\n\nA certain Colonel Frederick (c. 1725–1797), who claimed to be Theodore's son, was known as the Prince of Caprera. He served in the army of King Frederick II of Prussia and afterwards acted as agent in London for the duke of Württemberg. Frederick wrote an account of his purported father's life, \"Memoires pour servir a l'histoire de la Corse\", and also an English translation, both published in London in 1768. In 1795 he published an enlarged edition, \"A Description of Corsica\", with an account of its union to the crown of Great Britain.

It originally aired on ABC on 18 February 1966. The episode was directed by James Hill (known for \"A Study in Terror\" and \"Born Free\") and written by Brian Clemens.\n\nThe episode is widely known for Diana Rigg's risqué \"Queen of Sin\" costume (which she designed herself), and was the most watched episode of \"The Avengers\" on its original showing. There is a publicity still of the \"Queen of Sin\" holding James Hill, the episode's director, on a leash.\n\nThe story is episodic, beginning with a series of pranks on fictional important international figures, an exploding cigar and a collapsing floor under a potentate's box seat in an auditorium. Mrs Peel investigates the Honorable John Cleverly Cartney, a suave, womanizing gentleman who appears to be present before, during or after these events. Lord Darcy arrives and informs Cartney that he has arranged another prank. Meanwhile, Steed sneaks into Lord Darcy's place and, after knocking out Darcy's male housekeeper, finds a pair of fake scissors made of rubber. But real scissors are used by an unnamed, faceless official opening the \"International Friendship Club\" on an electrified ribbon, killing him, and Steed and Mrs Peel can't arrive in time. Lord Darcy did not expect to be involved in murder, and is distraught. Steed gets him drunk and, under guise of knowing him from a party, finds out the truth. Through Darcy, Steed is introduced to the Hellfire Club, responsible for the pranks. Mrs Peel goes to visit Cartney and discovers he is leading the Hellfire Club, an organization based upon dressing up in old costumes and engaging in orgiastic rituals and which thrives in \"ultimate sins\" with the purpose to replicate the historic club as closely as possible. Cartney is fascinated by Mrs Peel and tries multiple times to pursue an intimacy. She refuses this but continues to keep in contact with him.\n\nDuring one of the Club's parties, Darcy arrives and angrily demands a special meeting with the Assembly of Superiors on the \"Circle of Justice\" asking why they plotted a \"filthy rotten murder\" and implicated him. The centre of the circle opens as a trapdoor and Darcy is killed. On Mrs Peel's recommendation to Cartney, Steed stands to join the Hellfire Club and is given two membership tests including drinking an industrial amount of alcohol (which Steed does easily), and removing a pea from the line of an axe wielding member. Rather than trying to take the pea away, like another member who lost two fingers because of it, Steed simply blows the pea off the table as the axe is descending. Steed is welcomed by the group. As he is leaving, Steed overhears the gang and learns that they plan to stage an outrageous coup which will have the \"whole country up in arms\". Steed and Mrs Peel attend an orgy and investigate, spotting a cache of explosives. Steed questions a drunk girl and is told the gang are aiming to blow up Culverston House where a major international meeting is to take place that night. After being led away by some \"ladies in waiting\" at Cartney's request, Mrs Peel re-enters in a \"Queen of Sin\" outfit, holding a snake, and Cartney says to the group \"she's yours to do with what you will\". The members carry Mrs Peel on their shoulders, throwing rose petals on her as Steed watches with anxiety. As the assembled revelers watch a fight, Darcy's housekeeper recognizes Steed and exposes him to the organization as a spy. He wins the ensuing sword duel against the club expert (the man who lost two fingers). Mrs Peel goes underground and defeats the two members laying out the explosives before being attacked with a whip by Cartney, who drops to his death through the circle trapdoor when his whip catches on the hidden switch.\n\nThe final scene shows Steed and Mrs Peel decrying the newfangled \"horseless carriage\" which passes them as they saunter down the road atop a stagecoach being pulled by a team of horses.\n\n\nProduction for the episode was completed from mid-late December 1965. The episode was directed by James Hill.\n\nThe episode is best known for the scene in which Peel dons a revealing, kinky \"Queen of Sin\" costume (which Diana Rigg designed herself), complete with a dog collar with three-inch spikes, whalebone corset, and high leather boots, with a large snake. It is the Hellfire club members who dress her this way; she appears for less than ten minutes of show time in this manner, always demure, though ending with Cartney attacking her with a whip. As a result of this and other elements, the episode was not broadcast when \"The Avengers\" aired on American network television; it did air on British television, but with the whipping scene edited down to one crack of the whip, due to objections made by Associated-Rediffusion Television. James Chapman said of the episode, \"With its visual references to sado-masochistic pornography, 'A Touch of Brimstone' unsurprisingly ran into censorship difficulties with the ITV network; it was not screened in America at all.\" The episode has been cited as one of Diana Rigg's finest. The members of the Hellfire Club have been described as engaging in \"uninhibited debauchery\".\n\nThis episode was Chris Claremont's inspiration for the Hellfire Club in Marvel Comics' \"X-Men\", and in particular the story arc in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #132-134. Hellfire Club member Jason Wyngarde's name and likeness is based on Peter Wyngarde (who was later known for the role of Jason King).\n\nThis episode inspired the band The Electric Hellfire Club's namesake; in addition, the episode is heavily Sampled and used as audio cues/samples in several of EHC's songs, such as: Evil Genius (Queen of Sin) and HellFire!\n\n"}

In Sunni Islam, mostly known for being of the Ten Promised Paradise. Best known for his roles in the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Camel, in which he died, according to Sunnis he was given the title \"The Generous\" by Muhammad.\n\nTalhah was born c.594, the son of Ubaydallah ibn Uthman of the Taym clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. His mother, al-Saaba bint Abdullah, was from the Hadram tribe.\n\nHe is described as a dark-skinned man with a lot of wavy hair, a handsome face and a narrow nose. He liked to wear saffron-dyed clothes and musk. He walked swiftly and, when nervous, he would toy with his ring, which was of gold and set with a ruby.\n\nTalhah was a successful cloth-merchant who eventually left an estate estimated at 30 million \"dirhams\".\n\nIn 612 his kinsman Abu Bakr took him to visit Muhammad, and Talhah became a Muslim. He was said to have been one of the first eight converts.\n\nDuring the persecution of the Muslims in 614-616, Nawfal ibn Khuwaylid tied Talhah to Abu Bakr and left them roped together. Nobody from the Taym clan came to help. Thereafter they were known as \"the Two Tied Together\".\n\nIn September 622 Talhah was bringing a caravan home from Syria when he met Muhammad and Abu Bakr at al-Kharrar. They had escaped from Mecca and were emigrating to Medina. Talhah gave them some Syrian garments and mentioned that the Muslim community in Medina had said that their Prophet was slow to arrive. As Muhammad and Abu Bakr continued to Medina, Talhah returned to Mecca to put his affairs in order. Soon afterwards, he accompanied Abu Bakr's family to Medina, where he settled.\n\nAt first he lodged with As'ad ibn Zurarah, but later Muhammad gave him a block of land on which he built his own house. He was made the brother in Islam of Sa'id ibn Zayd. Talhah and Sa'id missed fighting at the Battle of Badr because Muhammad sent them as scouts to locate Abu Sufyan's caravan. However, both were awarded shares of the plunder, as if they had been present.\n\nTalhah distinguished himself at the Battle of Uhud by keeping close to Muhammad while most of the Muslim army fled. He protected Muhammad's face from an arrow by taking the shot in his own hand, as a result of which two of his fingers were paralysed. He was also hit twice in the head, and it was said that he suffered a total of 75 wounds in the battle.\n\nTalhah also fought at the Battle of the Trench \"and all the battles with Allah's Messenger\".\n\nIn the third week of July 632, Medina faced an imminent invasion by the apostate forces of Tulayha, a self-proclaimed prophet. Abu Bakr scraped together an army mainly from the Hashim clan (Muhammad's), appointing Talhah, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Zubayr ibn al-Awam as Commanders of one-third of the newly organised force each. However, they did not face any combat scenaria during the Ridda Wars.\n\nTalhah had at least fifteen children by at least eight different women.\n\n\"Other Children\"\n\n The Battle of the Camel was fought between Ali on one side and Aisha, Talhah and Zubayr on the other on 10 December 656. During the battle, Marwan ibn al-Hakam, who was fighting on the same side as Aisha, shot Talhah in the thigh. Marwan commented, \"After this I will never again seek a killer of Uthman.\" Talhah hugged his horse and galloped off the battle-field. He lay down using a stone as a pillow, while the auxiliaries tried to staunch the blood-flow. Whenever they stopped pressing, the bleeding resumed. In the end Talhah said, \"Stop it. This is an arrow sent by God.\" He died of this injury, aged 64.\n\nAccording to a hadith, Muhammad named Talhah among the Ten Promised Paradise (Arabic: العشرة المبشرون بالجنة; \"al-`Ashara al-Mubasharūn bi-l-Janna\").\n\nThe tomb of Talha ibn Ubaydullah is located in Basra, Iraq. The tomb is located a large mosque with modern architecture. The grave itself is under the cenotaph under the dome, which is built in a similar style to the cenotaph of Anas Ibn Malik.\n\nThe mosque and tomb of Talha Ibn Ubaydullah was detonated by Shia Muslim militants disguised as photographers. The militants planted bombs in the shrine, destroying the mosque and tomb. The tomb, which is under reconstruction, is still visited by Muslims.\n\n\n"}

The band was composed of Christopher Possanza (vocals, guitar), Josh Rosenfeld (bass guitar), Jason Avinger (guitar, vocals) and Barrett Wilke (drums).\n\nKnown for their unconventional song structures, and eclectic instrumentation (including the use of a clarinet in many tracks), the band released three full-length albums, \"Like Icicles\", \"The Curious Sofa\" and \"Fireworks\", and released many EPs.\n\nThis Busy Monster are also notable for forming the record label Barsuk Records, named after Avinger and Possanza's dog, which can be heard barking in the track \"Song 69\". Initially created in 1994 to release the band's material during their success in the early 1990s, Barsuk Records later became a very successful label in its own right, signing and releasing material from numerous local and internationally-known artists.\n\nThis Busy Monster formed in 1992, taking their name from a poem written by E. E. Cummings, releasing their first tape, \"Ginger\", in early 1992, before they had officially formed the band. With the release of \"Dark Hands\" in April 1993, the group was officially formed and began playing local shows. They performed numerous shows at local Seattle venues, playing with other local bands such as Sick and Wrong and The Thingmakers, and opening for the indie band Treepeople.\n\nIn 1994, the band released two singles, \"Belated\" in April with the help of Egg Studios and members of the band Posies, and \"Swing Dream\" was released in September. The band continued playing small venues with other local acts, often with members of the yet-to-be-formed Death Cab for Cutie. In 1994, they also created the band's record label Barsuk Records.\n\nIn 1995, the band went on a small tour with Built to Spill around the Pacific Northwest. In summer and fall, they finally gained notice from various music publications and touring with Modest Mouse. The \"Rocket\" (a Northwest music-related newspaper), the \"Seattle Weekly\" and the \"University of Washington Daily\" all printed good reviews, the UW Daily saying: \"This four-piece blends the conventions of 'interesting' music, replete with complex structures and difficult-sounding parts, with the undeniable pop-rock sensibility. Thus, they manage to sidestep the ghettoes of prog for something altogether catchier and more satisfying but never let matters become precious or cute. They have an undeniable power when playing live that turns on tightness and the tack-sharp, vaguely dissociative lyrics and vocal lines.\"\n\nIn 1996 and 1997, the band continued touring with Built To Spill and Death Cab for Cutie, with the latter signing to the band's Barsuk Records label. The band began recording its first full-length album, \"Like Icicles\", released in June 1998 on Barsuk Records. The band released two further albums, \"The Curious Sofa\" and \"Fireworks\", in 2000 and 2001, respectively.\n\nThe current status of the band is not known, as they have been largely inactive as a group since 2001.\n\n\nAll releases on Barsuk Records\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2167931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167931", "title": "Eisegesis", "text": "Eisegesis\n\nEisegesis () is the process of interpreting text in such a way as to introduce one's own presuppositions, agendas or biases. It is commonly referred to as \"reading into\" the text. It is often done to \"prove\" a pre-held point of concern, and to provide confirmation bias corresponding with the pre-held interpretation and any agendas supported by it. \n\nEisegesis is best understood when contrasted with \"exegesis\". Exegesis is drawing out text's meaning in accordance with the author's context and discoverable meaning. \"Eisegesis\" is when a reader imposes their interpretation of the text. Thus exegesis tends to be objective; and eisegesis, highly subjective.\n\nThe plural of eisegesis is \"eisegeses\" (). Someone who practices eisegesis is known as an \"eisegete\" (); this is also the verb form. \"Eisegete\" is often used in a mildly derogatory way.\n\nAlthough the terms \"eisegesis\" and \"exegesis\" are commonly heard in association with Biblical interpretation, both (especially exegesis) are broadly used across literary disciplines.\n\nWhile exegesis is an attempt to determine the historical context within which a particular verse exists—the so-called \"Sitz im Leben\" or life setting—eisegetes often neglect this aspect of Biblical study.\n\nIn the field of Biblical exegesis, scholars take great care to avoid eisegesis. In this field, eisegesis is regarded as \"poor exegesis\".\n\nIn the field of \"biblical proof texts\", Christian theologians and missionaries are often accused of practicing eisegesis using isolated, out-of-context quotations from the Christian Bible to establish a proposition or to read Christ into the Hebrew Bible.\n\nWhile some denominations and scholars denounce Biblical eisegesis, many Christians are known to employ it—albeit inadvertently—as part of their own experiential theology. Modern evangelical scholars accuse liberal Protestants of practicing Biblical eisegesis, while mainline scholars accuse fundamentalists of practicing eisegesis. Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians say that all Protestants engage in eisegesis, because the Bible can be correctly understood only through the lens of Holy Tradition as handed down by the institutional Church; this is articulated in the \"Dei verbum\". Protestants and fundamentalist Christians likewise often accuse Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians of eisegesis for viewing Scripture through Holy Tradition, and may accuse Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians of fabricating or distorting tradition to support their view, which they see as opposed to the doctrine of Sola scriptura where the text is believed to be able to speak for itself without Holy Tradition. Jews, in turn, might assert that Christians practice eisegesis when they read the Old Testament as anticipating Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nExactly what constitutes Biblical eisegesis remains a source of debate among theologians, but most scholars agree about the importance of determining the authorial intentions. Determining the author's intent can often be difficult, especially for books which were written anonymously.\n\nIn conducting Bible translation, translators have to make many exegetical decisions. Sometimes the decisions made by translators are criticized by those who disagree, and who characterize the work of the translators as involving \"eisegesis\". Some translators make their doctrinal distinctives clear in a preface, such as Stephen Reynolds in his Purified Translation of the Bible, where he explained his belief that Christians should never drink alcohol, and translated accordingly. Such translators may be accused by some of eisegesis, but they have made their positions clear.\n\n\n"}

It is supposed to be able both to fly and to travel under water. Starting from the surface of water is also intended.\n\nSince the requirements for designing a submarine are practically opposed to those of an airplane, the performance expected from such a construction is usually rather moderate.\n\nThe Soviet Union started building a naval fleet in the mid 20th century, including battleships, aircraft carriers and other ships. Encouraged by this, the leadership became more open to respective proposals.\n\nThe Soviet Union tried to develop a flying submarine during World War II, whose production never exceeded design phase. At the Naval Engineering Institute, a flying submarine project was headed by engineer Boris Ushakov.\n\nDuring his studies at the Dzerzhinsky naval engineers' academy in Saint Petersburg, which he finished in 1937, Boris Ushakov presented a draft for a project, which could unite the capabilities of an aircraft with those of a submarine. To be precise, this draft showed a seaplane able to dive.\n\nIn the following years, the project was revised and presented in multiple variations, enabling him to test the capacity and durability of particular components. In April 1936 the reviewer determined that Ushakov's was interesting and to be implemented. In July 1936 the draft project “Flying submarine” was checked and evaluated positively by the scientific research committee of the forces. The committee recommended to continue the project, to test its realisability using calculations and lab tests.\n\nIn 1937 the project was included into plan “W” (russ. “В”) of the committee. However, the project was cancelled after a reevaluation. Ushakov, by the time a “military technician 1st class” in department “W” of the committee continued the project in his spare time.\n\nIn 1938 the draft and the fundamental tactical-technical elements of Ushakov's flying submarine were evaluated once more by the 2nd department of the committee.\n\nThe design was supposed to be built as an all-metal construction and operate at 100 knots in the air and 3 knots under water. The engines were supposed to be sealed shut by metal plates while under water. The flying submarine was supposed to house six hermetically sealed chambers in its hull and wings: Three chambers to hermetically seal the three aircraft engines (AM-34; 1000 HP; while starting 1200 HP, using the turbo compressor), as well as the hermetically sealed pilot's chamber, a chamber for the accumulator and another one for the electric engine. All the other empty spaces of the aircraft were supposed to be filled with water while submerging. The time for preparation and actual submerging were projected at 1.5 minutes. The hull was to be constructed as a riveted duralumin cylinder, measuring 1.4 m across and 6 mm thick. The cockpit was supposed to be flooded while submerging, after the flying instruments were lowered into a waterproof shaft. The crew was supposed to enter the aft command centre and control the submarine from there.\n\nThe outer skin of the wings and the empennage was to be made of steel, the floats of duralumin. These parts were supposed to be filled with water while submerging, so they did not have to be designed for the water pressure in diving depth. The water was supposed to enter by itself through opened valves.\n\nThe containers for fuel and lubricant were to be placed in rubber reservoirs in the flying submarine's hull.\n\nAs a corrosion prevention, the flying submarine was supposed to be treated with special paints and varnishes.\n\nTwo special mounts for 18 inch torpedoes were supposed to be placed under the hull. The payload was supposed to be 44.5% of the take-off mass. This is a typical value for heavy aircraft of the time.\n\nFor surfacing, the excess water was supposed to be pumped out of the empty spaces. The electric engine was designed as an underwater drive.\n\nThe flying submarine was supposed to be used on the open sea for torpedo attacks on opposing ships. It was supposed to track these ships and await their arrival at the projected course while submerged. In case the opposing ship would not pass closely enough, another trial was supposed to be possible. Therefore the flying aircraft would have had to surface after the opposing ship was out of sight, track them again and await them again at the correct position.\n\nAnother projected use was entering naval areas and naval bases, which were blocked by mine belts. The flying submarine was supposed to pass the mines while in the air and then land inside an opposing restricted area, bay or naval base at night, submerge and act as a submarine. During the day, it would then have been able to gather intelligence on opposing forces, determine navigable water, or use an opportunity to attack.\n\nEspecially the combined use of multiple flying submarines offered great opportunities. In theory, three flying submarines would have been able to form a 15 km long cordon sanitaire, able to block the projected way of opposing ships.\n\nThe project was expected to counter a disadvantage of submarines, their bad manoeuvrability. Expectations were especially high for the ability to repeat attack manoeuvres using a short flight to a different attack location, if opposing ships would not pass closely enough. This was seen as one of the flying submarine's main advantages.\n\nIn 1939 the project was temporarily suspended and classified. In 1943, on the orders of NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria, the project was resumed. In 1947 the first test of the flying submarine was performed. In 1953, the project was closed by order of Communist Party First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. The design never \"got off the ground\".\n\nAs early as 1920, the British trade journal, ″Flying,″ reported conversations between the First Sea Lord and other military leaders and one of the principal aircraft manufacturers concerning a flying submarine (or submersible seaplane). The all-metal craft, its hypothetical design illustrated in the article, was to be a twin-propeller airplane with retractable wings and a hermetically sealed fuselage. There was, however, apparently no further development of the project.\n\nIn 1961 Donald Reid designed and built a single-seat craft (32.83 ft length) capable of flight and underwater movement, the Reid Flying Submarine 1 (RFS-1). A 65 hp (48 kW) engine mounted on a pylon provided propulsion for flight; a 1 hp electric motor in the tail provided underwater propulsion. The pilot used an aqualung for breathing underwater. The first full-cycle flight [underwater at 6.5 feet (2 m) depth, airborne at 33 ft (10 m) altitude] was demonstrated on 9 June 1964. Reid, his craft, and his son (the test pilot) appeared on the U.S. game show \"I've Got A Secret\" on March 15, 1965.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced that it was preparing to issue contracts for a submersible aircraft.\n\nA flying submarine was a feature in:\n\n\n\n"}

The stories were originally published in magazines in the UK and the US between 1924 and 1929.\n\nAll stories are narrated by the inexorable raconteur Mr Mulliner, a fisherman who tells stories at the Angler's Rest about members of his prodigious family, including one who is also a member of the Drones Club. The last three of the stories are about Bobbie Wickham; they were revised and given a Mr Mulliner frame for the book.\n\n\nThe story features Mr Mulliner's nephew Archibald Mulliner, the sock collector who can mimic a hen laying an egg, and his love Aurelia Cammarleigh. They also appear in \"Archibald and the Masses\" and \"The Code of the Mulliners\", both collected in \"Young Men in Spats\" (1936).\n\nAt the Angler's Rest, the subject of the \"Modern Girl\" comes up, and four drinkers believe that girls are smaller than before. They agree that it is impossible to understand why. Mr Mulliner interrupts to disagree with his companions, claiming that the disappearance of the \"dignified, queenly type of girl\" occurred because young men do not have the nerve to propose to them and their disappearance was Nature's method of ensuring the continuation of humanity. He had become convinced that this was the case upon observing the behavior of his nephew Archibald when he was in love with Aurelia Cammarleigh.\n\nArchibald first saw Miss Cammarleigh from out the window of the Drones Club and, though he immediately fell in love, he was careful to mask his feelings when enquiring of a fellow Drone, Algy Wymondham-Wymondham, whether he knew her. Algy does, and informs Archibald of her name as well as her family circumstances: she lives in Park Street with a \"potty\" aunt, who believes that Francis Bacon wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare.\n\nArchibald departs to buy socks and contemplate whether Aurelia would be attracted to him. He thinks she seems very dignified and sophisticated, and concludes that his primary talent, a masterful impression of a hen laying an egg, is insufficient; indeed, he becomes convinced that she would be put off by such a vulgar display. Consequently, when he first meets her at Ascot several weeks thereafter, he denies vehemently the ability to do the impression when she mentions that she heard that he could do the imitation. He reads about Shakespeare and Bacon for two weeks in order to impress Aurelia's aunt with his knowledge of them. This results in the aunt inviting Archibald to her country house.\n\nHe goes to the house, tries to impress Aurelia and her aunt by not smoking or drinking, and endures abstruse conversation with Aurelia's aunt, but is too nervous to speak to Aurelia. At night, Archibald eavesdrops on Aurelia and her friend Muriel. Aurelia tells her friend that she is disappointed that what Algy told her about Archibald's ability to imitate a hen laying an egg is not true, and thinks Archibald is too uptight. He also hears that Aurelia plans to play a prank on him by sending her bulldog into his room through the window. When Archibald hears her outside his window, he starts to give his imitation of a hen laying an egg. Aurelia is awestruck by his performance. She now sees that he is not uptight like she thought and they embrace. Archibald admits that he does smoke and drink, and that he actually dislikes Aurelia's aunt, which pleases Aurelia.\n\n\n\nAn argument in the Angler's Rest about giving up smoking leads to Mr Mulliner telling the following story about his nephew Ignatius Mulliner, a portrait-painter.\n\nIgnatius loves Hermione Rossiter and has proposed to her multiple times, but she has always turned him down. Hoping to find out why she has rejected him, Ignatius asks her brother Cyprian. Cyprian, a haughty art critic, claims that Hermione told him she did not like Ignatius because he was too similar to her other brother George, who does no work and lives on borrowed money. George, on the other hand, says that Hermione told him that Ignatius was too much like Cyprian. The only thing the brothers have in common is that they are heavy smokers, like Ignatius, so he believes that Hermione dislikes his smoking. He decides to give up smoking to win her over.\n\nIgnatius initially tries to cope with the loss of smoking by devoting himself to selfless acts. He invites Cypress to come to his flat to freely criticise his painting, and also invites George in order to give him a loan. Furthermore, he tells Hermione's mother, Mrs Rossiter, that he will paint Hermione's portrait for free. However, Ignatius is very irritable the next day. He threatens Cyprian with an ornamental dagger, kicks George, and insults Hermione's appearance. Afterward, Ignatius smokes his pipe. He becomes amiable again and regrets his words to Hermione. However, she is glad that he insulted her appearance, because she thought he had proposed to her for her looks alone and not for her intelligence, and she wants to be loved for her intelligence. They share an embrace. She explains that she compared Ignatius to her brothers because he plays the ukulele like George and wears sloppy clothes like Cyprian. Ignatius happily gives his ukulele away and goes with Hermione to a new tailor.\n\n\n\nMiss Postlethwaite, the popular barmaid at the Angler's Rest, has severed her engagement to Alfred Lukyn because he wanted to wear yellow shoes to church despite her objection. Mr Mullier remarks that, while a pair of yellow shoes parted Miss Postlethwaite from her fiancé, a similar pair of shoes brought Mulliner's cousin Cedric a bride.\n\nFastidious 45-year-old bachelor Cedric Mulliner lives at the Albany, and has an efficient secretary, Myrtle Watling. At a luncheon in Grosvenor Square, he sees a friend, Lady Chloe Downblotton. After the luncheon, they run into Lady Chloe's fiancé Claude. Lady Chloe is alarmed that Claude is wearing yellow shoes with otherwise correct morning-clothes. She asks Cedric Mulliner to trade shoes with Claude. Cedric is very fashion-conscious and reluctant to do so, but he agrees because Lady Chloe is the well-connected daughter of an earl and Cedric admires the aristocracy. After trading shoes, he immediately gets a cab to return to the Albany. However, he is unwilling to walk into the prestigious building with the wrong kind of shoes. He tells the cab-driver, Mr Lanchester, to go to the suburb Valley Fields, where Cedric's secretary lives, to get her help.\n\nAt the house, Cedric tells the cab-driver to wait, but decides he cannot face Miss Watling in morning-clothes and yellow shoes. He hears someone snoring, and looks through a window to see a man fast asleep in an armchair with black boots beside him. Cedric quietly sneaks through the window and tries to grab the boots. The man wakes up and Cedric only manages to exchange one of his yellow shoes for a black one, and drops his top hat too. Discouraged by the loss of his hat, Cedric gives up and decides to exit the house out the back, but he gets stuck in the sash window, with his head outside the house. Cedric blames Lady Chloe for his situation and now hates the aristocracy. Outside, Miss Watling sees Cedric, and he tells her his story. She states that Cedric needs someone to look after him. She does not mind taking on the job and will marry him. The man who had slept in the chair appears along with Mr Lanchester, and Myrtle tells the former, who is her father, that Cedric is her fiancé. Cedric had never thought of marrying, but he agrees anyway, since Myrtle would at least help keep him from predicaments like this and is not part of the aristocracy.\n\n\n\nMr Mulliner claims that a man who has to overcome obstacles to get married will be less likely to get a divorce, because he will not take his wife for granted. He attributes the happiness of his nephew Osbert's marriage to the difficulties Osbert faced to get married. Mulliner tells the following story.\n\nOsbert Mulliner is courting Mabel Petherick-Soames and she seems to return his feelings. One evening, just after Osbert kisses her, Mabel's cousin, intimidating explorer J. Bashford Braddock, appears. He also loves Mabel and privately threatens Osbert to stop spending time with Mabel. Afraid of Braddock, Osbert writes a letter of farewell to Mabel saying that he has been called away to Australia. The next day, Osbert is visited by Major-General Sir Masterman Petherick-Soames, Mabel's uncle. He will not allow Osbert to trifle with his niece's affections and tells him their engagement will shortly be announced.\n\nOsbert's valet Parker informs him that Braddock has heard about announcement and will shortly visit Osbert. To avoid Braddock's wrath, Osbert tells Parker that he will leave for India and no longer needs domestic staff. Osbert also disguises himself with a wig and false whiskers. He goes to the second-hand clothing establishment of the Bros Cohen for new clothes. Unfortunately for Osbert, both Braddock and the Major-General are there. Having spent years in India, the Major-General offers to see the disguised Osbert off to his ship. Osbert fears he will be recognized out in the sunlight, so he gives up on his plan to sail. Osbert decides to run away to a suburb, but first he returns to his now unstaffed house at South Audley Street. He hides behind some curtains when he realizes two burglars are there. The burglars, Harold and Ernest, drink Osbert's wine and get into an argument with each other about good manners. They knock each other out. Osbert calls the police. Braddock comes, intending to intimidate Osbert again, but is daunted when Osbert claims he overpowered the burglars. Braddock instead asks if Osbert would like a fish-slice for a wedding present.\n\n\n\nA poet staying at the Angler's Rest is made uneasy after a hunter with dead rabbits stops by. Mulliner is reminded of his niece, Charlotte Mulliner.\n\nCharlotte has an ample private income and writes \"Vignettes in Verse\" for artistic weekly magazines for no charge, merely because she likes to see her works published. At a literary luncheon, she meets Aubrey Bollinger, who writes \"Pastels in Prose\" under the name Aubrey Trefusis. Aubrey is compassionate towards animals and does not fit in with the rest of his family, who are enthusiastic about hunting. Charlotte sympathizes with Aubrey. His parents and two brothers live at Bludleigh Court in Bedfordshire, where Charlotte is supposed to visit soon since her mother was a friend of Lady Bassinger. Aubrey warns her that Bludleigh Court exercises a spell and somehow causes its inhabitants to want to hunt. Charlotte is confident she will not be affected. Regardless, Aubrey accompanies her to the house to help defend her from the influence of the house. Charlotte and Aubrey appear to have feelings for each other.\n\nAubrey's gnu-hunting uncle, Colonel Francis Pashley-Drake, annoys Charlotte by talking to her about hunting and insulting Aubrey. Aubrey is about to propose to Charlotte when he suddenly tries to chase a rat with Charlotte's parasol. He then seems to wake from a trance and finishes proposing to Charlotte, but she refuses because he chased the rat. He tells her that the spell of the house overcame him, but she does not believe him. While staying in the house, Charlotte writes a poem for the \"Animal-Lovers' Gazette\", but the editor rejects her poem \"Good Gnus\", which is about hunting gnus. Charlotte wonders why they rejected it, since she now thinks hunting is a good pastime. Followed by Aubrey, who is also eager to hunt, she takes a shot at Colonel Pashley-Drake with an air-gun while he is sunbathing and hits him in the leg. Pashley-Drake is unhappy about being at the other end of a hunt and flees into Lady Bassinger's garden party, surprising the guests. He hides behind a bishop. Charlotte and Aubrey come to their senses, and Charlotte believes the house affected both of them. They agree to leave the house immediately and get married.\n\n\nIn addition to being a Mulliner story, \"Those in Peril on the Tee\" is also one of Wodehouse's golf stories. The story is told by the Oldest Member in the magazine versions. \"Those in Peril on the Tee\" was included in the 1973 Wodehouse collection \"The Golf Omnibus\".\n\n\nMr Mulliner speaks to two young men in golfing attire and tells them he used to play golf before taking up the pastime of fishing. Despite their efforts to get out of listening to the story, Mr Mulliner tells them about the only Mulliner to have attained any real proficiency at golf, Agnes Flack, the daughter of a distant cousin of his.\n\nTwo quiet, timid men, mystery writer John Gooch and cartoonist Frederick Pilcher, often call at Agnes Flack's house. The two men each have a handicap of eighteen. The hearty and athletic Agnes is more skilled and a scratch player (meaning she has a handicap of zero). Sidney McMurdo, a muscular golfer who was once a semi-finalist in the Amateur Championship, loves Agnes, but she merely laughs at him every time he proposes to her. After he proposes to her for the eleventh time, she tells McMurdo she wants to marry someone intellectual. She thinks both Gooch and Pilcher love her. Having been inspired by magazine stories about men playing a match of golf to decide who was to win the heroine, she plans a match of golf between Gooch and Pilcher to determine which one she will marry. Gooch and Pilcher do not actually love Agnes, and only called at her house to draw inspiration from her for their stories and cartoons respectively, but neither are willing to admit this to the intimidating McMurdo.\n\nBoth Gooch and Pilcher hope to lose and plan to play badly in their match, but not obviously enough to be suspected by McMurdo, who will be the referee. Pilcher shows up wearing a glossy top hat and morning-coat, claiming he has to go into the city immediately after the match, and actually hoping the constrictive clothes will make him play worse. Gooch tries to influence Pilcher subconsciously by repeatedly telling him he will play well. However, their efforts backfire. Gooch only influenced his own subconscious and plays well, while the constrictive clothes help correct Pilcher's tendency to over-swing. Both men play better than usual, and begin to think that marrying Agnes is worth playing such a good game, when Agnes arrives and referees the rest of the match. Not wanting to marry her, Gooch and Pilcher manage to play badly. Pilcher picks up his ball, pretending to brush mud off it, and is disqualified. Gooch is irritated, and regrets he did not think of doing this himself. Fortunately for Gooch, Agnes is unwilling to marry anyone who plays golf as badly as he did and will marry McMurdo.\n\n\n\nMr Mulliner returns from visiting his cousin Lady Wickham at her home of Skeldings Hall in Hertfordshire. Lady Wickham is somewhat worried about her daughter, Roberta \"Bobbie\" Wickham, since she does not get married. Roberta is mischievous and gets her suitors into trouble. Sipping his usual hot Scotch and lemon, Mulliner tells the story of one of Roberta's suitors, Roland Moresby Attwater.\n\nRoland, an essayist and literary critic, attends his uncle's dinner with a mud-stained shirt, and is eager to recount how his shirt became muddy, but everyone is too polite to ask about it. His uncle, city magistrate Sir Joseph Moresby, thinks the quiet and sensible Roland should marry Lucy Moresby, who is also quiet and sensible. His uncle finally mentions the mud, and Roland tells him he got dirty by pulling a man out of the way of a car in Duke Street and saved his life. Roland does not want to marry Lucy because he loves Bobbie Wickham, whom Sir Joseph fined at court for speeding. Roland gave a positive review of one of Lady Wickham's books, though he dislikes it, and is rewarded with an invitation to the Wickham home, Skeldings Hall. At his flat, Roland discovers that the man he saved, who owns a bird-and-snake shop, sent him a box with something squishy inside as a gift. To Roland's surprise, it is a snake. Bobbie thinks Roland should use the snake for mischief, but Roland disagrees and wants the snake returned.\n\nAt Skeldings, Roland has a rival for Bobbie's affections, the handsome and dignified Sir Claude Lynn. Bobbie tells Roland that she put the snake, which she named Sidney and had Roland's valet pack in his luggage, in Sir Claude's bed for the fun of it. Roland fears that the snake will be traced back to him, so he goes to Sir Claude's room to retrieve it. While he is in the room, he hears Sir Claude enter, and hides in a large cupboard. However, Sir Claude finds him. Thinking him drunk, he removes Roland from the room. Sir Claude then finds the snake, and alerts the household. Lady Wickham's butler, Simmons, is able to confirm that the snake belongs to Roland since the footman Thomas moved Roland's luggage, including the box with the snake. Roland hides in his room from Sir Claude and Lady Wickham. Simmons knocks on Roland's door, and returns the snake to him on a salver. Bobbie suggests that Roland sneak out and take an early train to London. The next day, Roland tells his new fiancée Lucy about how he saved a man's life in Duke Street.\n\n\n\nMr Mulliner continues telling the patrons of the Angler's Rest about the unfortunate suitors of his cousin's daughter, Bobbie Wickham. The following story concerns Dudley Finch, a cousin of Roland Attwater.\n\nDudley's godfather, Mr Sampson Broadhurst, has offered to take him to Australia to teach him sheep-farming. However, Dudley does not want to leave because he loves Bobbie Wickham, despite the disapproval of his cousin Roland. Bobbie says that Dudley can come to Skeldings. She will send her mother a wire, and states that Lady Wickham will be awfully glad to see Dudley. When Dudley first arrives at Skeldings, Lady Wickham mistakenly thinks he is an interviewer from \"Milady's Boudoir\". He clarifies that he is a friend of Bobbie, who evidently forgot to send her mother a wire. Lady Wickham is not pleased that Dudley is there. To make things worse, he is unable to wear proper dinner clothes since he accidentally switched his suitcase with someone at the Drones Club who was going to a fancy dress party with a boyish sailor suit costume.\n\nFeeling discouraged, Dudley plans to leave and asks about the train schedule. Simmons informs Lady Wickham that Dudley apparently brought a disguise and inquired about the early morning train, and therefore is probably a burglar. Furthermore, Bobbie has not yet arrived, so Simmons thinks Dudley may be lying about being her friend. Simmons keeps watch with a gun and alerts Lady Wickham when Dudley goes to the dining room, not knowing he is merely looking for food. Dudley pretends he wanted a book to read. While talking about books, he insults the works of George Masterman, not knowing this is the pen name used by Lady Wickham. Embarrassed, Dudley returns to his room, and Simmons continues to keep watch. Finally, Bobbie appears. She got into an accident and is in trouble for ruining her car. She told her mother she did not know Dudley to avoid getting in more trouble. Following her directions, Dudley bribes Simmons with five pounds and sneaks out through the window. Dudley is far from the house when he gets shot in the fleshy part of his leg. The next day, Bobbie apologizes for this. She explains Simmons wasn't trying to hit him and just wanted Lady Wickham to hear a shot. Dudley retorts that he hopes Lady Wickham was pleased and that he is going to Australia.\n\n\n\nMr Mulliner remarks that few things are more painful than an argument between boyhood friends, and that such a situation occurred between Algy Crufts and Ambrose Wiffin.\n\nAlgy and Ambrose planned a trip to Monte Carlo together. Although they have bought their tickets, Ambrose wants to put off their trip for a fortnight so he can court Bobbie Wickham. Algy, an old friend of Bobbie's, knows all too well that other fellows who come in contact with Bobbie end up in trouble and warns Ambrose, but Ambrose does not believe him. Algy refuses to wait and will go to Monte Carlo alone if Ambrose will not leave with him in two days. Bobbie Wickham wants to help her friend Jane Falconer choose cushions for her new flat, but her mother insists that she take her young cousin Wilfred and his friend, Esmond Bates (called \"Old Stinker\" by Wilfred), to the movies. Bobbie invites Ambrose to join them. The boys are annoying but Ambrose agrees so that he can spend time with Bobbie. They go to the Tivoli to see a lively film entitled \"Where Passion Lurks\", based (obviously very loosely) on the poem \"We are Seven\". Bobbie leaves before the film starts, claiming to have just remembered an appointment, leaving Ambrose to look after the two boys.\n\nBefore the film, Ambrose dropped his hat and it got stepped on, and the boys mock Ambrose for this repeatedly before and after the movie. Irritated, he smacks Wilfred on the head. A passing elderly lady rebukes Ambrose, embarrassing him. Then the boys want to eat oysters, and after the expenses of transportation and the movie, Ambrose regretfully does not have enough money to tip the waiter at the end of the meal. Next, they take an omnibus. While on the bus, Ambrose realizes that Bobbie lied about having an appointment and never intended to see the movie with him. Chaos ensues when a man is frightened by Esmond's white mouse. At this point, Ambrose has had enough and leaves the bus. The next day, he receives a letter from Bobbie, which expresses her disappointment in him for leaving the boys in London. A policeman brought Wilfred home. Ambrose picks up the telephone and tells Algy that he will meet him the next day for their trip to Monte Carlo.\n\nIn the \"Strand\" (UK), six of the stories were illustrated by Charles Crombie.

{"id": "2167950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2167950", "title": "Antonov A-40", "text": "Antonov A-40\n\nThe Antonov A-40 \"Krylya Tanka\" (, meaning \"tank wings\") was a Soviet attempt to allow a tank to glide onto a battlefield after being towed aloft by an airplane, to support airborne forces or partisans. A prototype was built and tested in 1942, but was found to be unworkable. This vehicle is sometimes called the \"A-40T\" or \"KT\".\n\nInstead of loading light tanks onto gliders, as other nations had done, Soviet airborne forces had strapped T-27 tankettes underneath heavy bombers and landed them on airfields. In the 1930s there were experimental efforts to parachute tanks or simply drop them into water. During the 1940 occupation of Bessarabia, light tanks may have been dropped from a few meters up by TB-3 bombers, which, as long as the gearbox was in neutral, would allow them to roll to a stop.\n\nThe biggest problem with air-dropping vehicles is that their crews drop separately, and may be delayed or prevented from bringing them into action. Gliders allow crews to arrive at the drop zone along with their vehicles. They also minimize exposure of the valuable towing aircraft, which need not appear over the battlefield. So the Soviet Air Force ordered Oleg Antonov to design a glider for landing tanks.\n\nAntonov was more ambitious. Instead of building a glider, he added a detachable cradle to a T-60 light tank bearing large wood and fabric biplane wings and a twin tail. Such a tank could glide into the battlefield, drop its wings, and be ready to fight within minutes.\n\nOne T-60 was converted into a glider in 1942, intended to be towed by a Petlyakov Pe-8 or a Tupolev TB-3. The tank was lightened for air use by removing its armament, ammunition and headlights, and leaving a very limited amount of fuel. Even with these modifications, the TB-3 bomber had to ditch the glider during its only flight, on September 2, 1942, to avoid crashing, due to the T-60's extreme drag (although the tank reportedly glided smoothly). The A-40 was piloted by the famous Soviet experimental glider pilot Sergei Anokhin. The T-60 landed in a field near the airport, and after dropping the glider wings and tail, the driver returned it to its base. Due to the lack of a sufficiently-powerful aircraft to tow it at the required , the project was abandoned.\n\nThe Soviet Union continued to develop methods to efficiently deploy airborne vehicles. By the mid-1970s they were able to para-drop BMD-1 fighting vehicles with their crew aboard.\n\nThe attack plane Ilyushin Il-2 has also been nicknamed \"the flying tank\".\n\n"}

One common theory says the term originates from an acronym that was stamped on the beachgoers' train tickets, representing the city in which they boarded the train to the Jersey Shore: Bayonne, Elizabeth, Newark, and New York City. The term \"Benny\" may also originate from the early 20th century practice of wealthy New Yorkers taking trips to the Jersey Shore as treatment for myriad maladies such as anemia, hemophilia, and hysteria. These therapeutic trips were called \"beneficials\" by doctors and patients. Often, visitors would claim to be at the Jersey Shore on a \"beneficial\", hence the term Benny. Another theory is that \"Benny\" was used to identify New Yorkers who came down the shore flashing wads of $100 bills. \"Benny\" refers to Ben Franklin, whose picture is on the $100 bill. Still another theory refers to off-shore boat racing during the 1970's sponsored by the restaurant chain \"Benihana's\".\n\nThe term 'Shoobie' is used by residents of resort communities in the southern New Jersey Shore, from Long Beach Island to Cape May. The term shoobie was originally used to describe day-trippers who took the train to the shore. The train offered pre-packed lunches that came in shoe boxes; hence the term \"shoobie.\" However, over time the meaning has changed to include tourists who wear sneakers or shoes on the beach, as opposed to most locals who go barefoot on the sand.\n\n"}

The requirements for amateurism have now been dissolved, and professionalism is permitted in the UK, so in 1996 the name was changed to the British Fencing Association. (A membership body for professional fencing coaches, the British Academy of Fencing, was not founded in its current form until 1949).\n\nThe AFA's had combined twin roles as both Home Country Governing Body for England and national governing body. In 2002 in response to public funding frameworks, a new, separate body - England Fencing - was formed specifically to carry out the certain governing body activities for England. Over time, the boundary between the two roles has eroded.\n\nIn recent years, the 'Association' changed its legal status, and the organisation became British Fencing.\n\nIn January 2011 British Fencing announced a five-year sponsorship deal worth £1 million with Beazley Group, the specialist Lloyd’s insurer. Beazley was the principal sponsor – as well as the official insurer – of British Fencing until the end of 2015.\n\nIn 2016 a second major sponsor was announced, and Wilkinson Sword became British Fencing's new principal sponsor.\n\nBF is responsible for all international fencing conducted while representing Great Britain. They control the selection criteria for all relevant competitions. They are responsible for any attendance by fencers at official FIE competitions, including the World Championships and World Cup competitions, and also at the Olympics under the IOC.\n\nBF is also responsible for all national domestic events. It runs British Championships in a variety of age categories and at all three weapons of fencing (foil, épée and sabre). BF licenses member clubs and competition organisers to run fencing competitions some of which earn participants ranking points. These points are used by the BFA to create national rankings at senior, junior (U20) and cadet (U17) level.\n\nBF is responsible for ensuring that the sport has a robust governance structure, appropriately insured, and that those operating within the sport are appropriately qualified.\n\nBF sets out the Safety Standards, rules and guidelines under which the sport operates.\n\nBF also runs coaching schemes, and other activities relating to the promotion of fencing in the UK.\n\nBF run a Talent programme (funded by Sport England) to support young fencers (14-23) demonstrating motivation and capability to represent GBR.\n\nBF publishes a magazine, The Sword.\n\nBritish Fencing currently receives funding from Sport England and UK Sport (international relations funding).\n\nBF collects membership fees on behalf of all the Home Country Associations - 40% of membership fees collected is passed to these associations.\n\nIn December 2015, a five-year sponsorship deal worth £1million with Beazley Group, the specialist Lloyd’s insurer came to an end.\n\nDuring that time the investment from Beazley helped fund Great Britain teams (including Paralympic hopefuls), The National Academy, programs for increased grassroots participation to the sport, British Fencing run events, including World Cup events as well as marketing and promotion of the sport.\n\nBF is currently sponsored by Wilkinson Sword.\n\nUntil March 2017 BF operated a World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) which was a programme, funded by UK Sport, which helped British Fencing to fund those athletes who are likely to achieve podium success at the Olympic Games.\n\nUnder this programme, the Men's Foil Team qualified for Rio 2016 which was the first time that a Fencing team had qualified under the system introduced by the FIE 20 years ago. The team achieved 6th - narrowly losing to Russia, the eventual winners - and Richard Kruse came 4th in the individual event - the best Olympic results in decades.\n\nIn December 2016, UK Sport announced that they had withdrawn funding from fencing. In the funding review, Fencing was banded by UK Sport as Band 4. This means that Fencing was considered a 'possible' not 'probable' medal winning sport for Tokyo 2020. Along with all the other sports in Band 4, Fencing lost its WCP funding.\n\nFencers are ranked by category (Cadet, Junior and Senior), weapon (foil, épée or sabre) and gender.\nRankings are calculated from ranking points earned in competitions attended by the fencers. The number of points earned depends on the strength of the competition as well as how well the fencer did.\n\nCurrent rankings can be found on the British Fencing Website.\n\nThe Board of British Fencing (BF) is responsible for the overall governance, development and management of the sport of fencing in GB. The Board sets the strategic direction of the sport, appoints the CEO and monitors progress and results.\n\nThe Board consists of twelve Board Directors, of whom eight are elected and four appointed by the Board (these four being the Chair of the Board and of British Fencing, an Additional Director and two Independent Directors). The Board’s quorum rules specify that the elected members must always be in the majority. In addition to these voting directors, Board meetings are attended by the BF President and Home Country and athlete representatives. Staff members attend some meetings, or parts of meetings, to brief/advise the Board.\n\nUnder its auspices the six Home Nations (Wales, England, Northern Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey and Scotland) have their own governing bodies.

Thomas played college hockey for the University of Vermont for four years, from 1993–1997, during which he was drafted 217th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He played for several years in the minor leagues and Europe, before making it to the NHL at age 28, with the Boston Bruins. He finally emerged as the Bruins' starting goaltender at age 32. Thomas is a two-time winner of the Vezina Trophy (2009 and 2011) as the NHL's best goaltender, and was a member of Team USA in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Thomas won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player in the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs. He was the oldest player in NHL history to win the award at age 37. Thomas is one of four American-born players to win the Conn Smythe Trophy, along with Brian Leetch, Jonathan Quick, and Patrick Kane.\n\nThomas played four seasons (1993–97) of college hockey for the University of Vermont, posting an 81–43–15 record to go with a 2.70 GAA and .934 save percentage. He ranks third in the NCAA Division I record book in career saves (3,950). He led the nation in save percentage in 1996 (.924) and helped UVM's Catamounts to NCAA tournament appearances in his final two seasons, including a berth in the 1996 NCAA Frozen Four (a program first). He was a two-time All-ECAC Conference selection and a two-time NCAA East All-American. He ranks first all-time amongst Vermont goalies in games played (140), wins (81) and saves (3,950). At Vermont, Thomas played on the same team as former NHL All-Star Martin St. Louis.\n\nCompleting his four-year tenure at Vermont, Thomas played briefly for the Birmingham Bulls of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) and Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League (IHL) in 1997–98, before transferring overseas mid-season to HIFK of the Finnish SM-Liiga. Thomas played 18 games with a save percentage of .947 as the team advanced through the playoffs to defeat Ilves in the finals and win the Finnish championship. After signing with the Edmonton Oilers on June 4, 1998, Thomas initially moved to the American Hockey League (AHL) the following season with the Hamilton Bulldogs, where he played 15 games, before again transferring to HIFK. Thomas recorded a .917 save percentage in 14 games as HIFK made it to the league finals once more but finished as runners-up to TPS.\n\nIn 1999–2000, Thomas returned once again to North America to play for the Detroit Vipers of the IHL, then spent the next season with AIK IF of the Swedish Elitserien. In 2001, he joined the Boston Bruins organization, but chose to continue playing in Europe, spending his first full SM-liiga season in 2001–02 with Kärpät. Although the team did not get far in the playoffs, Thomas played a successful season of 32 games with a .925 save percentage.\n\nBeginning in 2002–03, Thomas played his initial two seasons with Boston's AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut with the Bruins during the 2002–03 season, appearing in four games total, with a .907 save percentage and a 3–1 record. Thomas recorded his first NHL win in his league debut with the Bruins on October 19, 2002, in a 31-save, 4–3 win against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nAs a result of the one-season duration NHL lockout in North America, in 2004–05 Thomas joined Jokerit of the SM-Liiga, his fourth stint in Finland. He played in all games of the season except one, 54 games in total, and posted a league-high .946 save percentage. He also surpassed the previous record of 13 shutouts in the league by achieving 15 shutouts during the regular season. Thomas continued to perform in the playoffs, where he played 12 games with a .938 save percentage. However, the team was unable to defeat Kärpät in the finals, and Thomas was awarded his second silver medal in the SM-liiga. He received the Lasse Oksanen trophy (as the league's best player) and the Kultainen kypärä award (as the league's best player award as voted by the players), becoming the first Jokerit player to win the award since Teemu Selänne.\n\nIn August 2005, Thomas signed to play with Jokerit for the 2005–06 season, but his contract included an NHL option and on September 14, one day before the regular season in the SM-liiga started, Thomas announced he had signed with the Boston Bruins, leaving Jokerit with rookie goaltender Joonas Hallikainen as their sole goaltender. Eventually, Jokerit used three North American goaltenders (Karl Goehring, Steve Passmore and Tom Askey) that season, but missed the playoffs.\n\nWhen he returned to North America, Thomas was assigned to the Providence Bruins of the AHL out of training camp. However, as Boston suffered injuries to their two goaltenders Andrew Raycroft and Hannu Toivonen, Thomas earned his first call-up to the NHL in three years and took over as the Bruins starter, completing the 2005–06 season with a 12–13–7 record, 2.77 goals against average (GAA), .917 save percentage and his first NHL shutout. As a result, Thomas was awarded the Boston Bruins 7th Player Award, voted by the fans as having gone beyond expectations. In the off-season, Thomas was re-signed by the Bruins to a three-year contract.\n\nAlthough Boston's previous starter, Andrew Raycroft, was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the off-season, Thomas began the 2006–07 season as the Bruins' backup, behind Hannu Toivonen instead. However, as Toivonen struggled, Thomas was again promoted as the Bruins' starting goaltender, eventually posting a 30–29–4 record with a .904 save percentage. He won the 7th Player Award for the second consecutive season and became the first goaltender in team history to win the award twice.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, Thomas began a yoga-based physical conditioning program to increase his flexibility and strength, and one that would greatly increase his abilities during the 2007–08 season and onwards.\n\nOn July 1, 2007, the Bruins acquired goaltender Manny Fernandez from the Minnesota Wild and later traded Thomas' previous backup, Toivonen, to the St. Louis Blues. Many hockey analysts presumed Thomas would support Fernandez as a backup goaltender once again for the 2007–08 season. However, as Fernandez went down to injury early in the season, Thomas seized the opportunity and once again emerged as the Bruins' starter. He was selected for his first NHL All-Star Game on January 22, 2008, as a replacement for Martin Brodeur and played in the third period of the game, stopping 14 of 18 shots. Thomas was credited with the win, as the Eastern Conference defeated the Western Conference 8–7.\n\nEarly in the 2008–09 season, Thomas became the first Bruins goaltender to record back-to-back shutouts since Byron Dafoe in 1999, winning 1–0 games against the Edmonton Oilers on October 27, 2008, and the Vancouver Canucks on October 28. His overall shutout streak came to end the next game at 154:43 minutes against the Calgary Flames on October 30. In late November, Thomas missed a few games due to an illness. He was chosen to play in his second All-Star Game in 2009 and was once again the winning goaltender for the Eastern Conference, defeating the Western Conference 12–11 in a shootout (the first time the All-Star Game required the tie-breaker since 2003). One month later, on February 26, 2009, Thomas recorded his 100th NHL win in a 6–0 shutout against the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nOn April 2, 2009 Thomas agreed to a four-year contract extension with the Bruins, through the 2012–13 season. The contract saw him make $6 million the first two seasons, then $5 million and $3 million the final two seasons for an average annual salary of $5 million. Two days later, on April 4, he posted his career-high fifth shutout of the season in a 1–0 win against the New York Rangers, clinching the top spot in the Eastern Conference, Boston's first title since 2001–02. His strong play allowed the Bruins to sweep the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the 2009 playoffs, however the Bruins were defeated by the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games in the second round.\n\nOn June 18, 2009, Thomas was awarded the Vezina Trophy at the NHL awards, edging Minnesota Wild netminder Niklas Bäckström and the Columbus Blue Jackets' rookie goaltender Steve Mason. He led the NHL with his 2.10 GAA and .933 save percentage.\n\nThomas started for the Bruins in the 3rd NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2010. The game, held at Fenway Park in Boston, resulted in a 2–1 overtime victory over the visiting Philadelphia Flyers. But Thomas suffered a drop-off in form during the regular season, posting just a 17–18–8 record, albeit with a still-strong 2.56 GAA. He did not play at all in the playoffs, as Tuukka Rask played all the games for Boston. The Bruins won their First Round series and led the Philadelphia Flyers three games to none in the Conference semi-final. Boston then lost the next four games to drop the series; the Flyers became just the third out of four teams in NHL history (after the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and the 1975 New York Islanders, and before the 2014 Los Angeles Kings) to win a series after losing the first three games.\n\nNamed to his third straight NHL All-Star Game in 2011 – the game was not played in 2010 due to the Winter Olympics – Thomas became the first goaltender in NHL history to earn the win in three consecutive All-Star Games.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, following off-season hip surgery during the summer of 2010, Thomas broke the NHL record for save percentage, beating Dominik Hašek's record of .937, with a .938 percentage. On April 22, 2011, Thomas was named a finalist for the 2010–11 Vezina Trophy, which he won on June 22.\n\nOn May 27, 2011, Thomas posted a shutout victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, sending the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup appearance since 1990. In the Final, Thomas again posted a shutout victory in Game 7 against the Vancouver Canucks. During the Bruins' playoff run, he set the record for most saves in a single post-season with 798 and the most saves in a Stanley Cup series with 238, and broke Frank McCool's 66-year-old record of fewest goals allowed in a seven-game Stanley Cup Final, allowing only eight goals total (for an all-time record .967 save percentage in the Stanley Cup Finals). Thomas also became the first goaltender ever to post a shutout in a Game 7 on the road. He won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, and at 37 years, 62 days, Thomas is the oldest recipient of the award. He became just the second American-born NHL player to ever win the award, 17 years after Brian Leetch did so in 1994, plus Thomas was also the first American-born goaltender to receive this honor.\n\nThomas began the 2011–12 season as a Stanley Cup champion and the defending Vezina and Conn Smythe trophy winner. He played the majority of the 82-game schedule for the Bruins, beating Tuukka Rask for the number one spot for the second consecutive year. Although not completely matching the previous year's record-breaking run, Thomas received the most votes in the 2012 All Star Game Ballot, entering the 2012 NHL All-Star Game as the starting goaltender, and put up another solid year with the Bruins, helping them dominate the NHL with their goal differential for the majority of the year.\n\nThe Bruins ended up losing in seven games to the Washington Capitals in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Every game of the series was won by only one goal. Shortly after the Bruins' season ended, Thomas announced that he would sit out the 2012–13 season. Bruins' general manager Peter Chiarelli confirmed Thomas' decision.\n\nWith the retirement of Adam Foote during the off-season, Thomas became one of only two Quebec Nordiques draft picks still active in the NHL, the other being Milan Hejduk.\n\nThomas was traded to the New York Islanders on February 7, 2013, in exchange for a conditional second-round draft pick in either 2014 or 2015. Before the trade, the Bruins had suspended Thomas for not reporting to training camp. Thomas did not play any games with the Islanders organization before his contract expired.\n\nAfter taking a year off from the NHL, Thomas joined the Florida Panthers on a tryout contract on September 16, 2013. He officially signed a one-year contract with the Panthers on September 26. Thomas has mentioned he chose 34 as his jersey number with the Panthers in honor of John Vanbiesbrouck, a goaltender from Michigan whom he grew up watching.\n\nThomas was acquired by the Dallas Stars on March 5, 2014, in exchange for goaltender Dan Ellis. He went back to number 30 in Dallas and served as backup to Kari Lehtonen.\n\nDuring Thomas' college career with the University of Vermont, he was twice named to the United States squad for the World Championships. Following his sophomore year, he was chosen for the 1995 World Championships, but did not appear in any games as the United States finished in sixth place. He was chosen for the tournament for the second consecutive year in 1996 and made his international debut, playing in 21 minutes for one game, allowing one goal. Thomas picked up his first medal as the United States won bronze.\n\nAfter graduating from the college program, Thomas was named to Team USA for the 1998 World Championships following his rookie professional season and played his first full international game. However, the United States finished a disappointing 12th. Thomas would not make another World Championships appearance until 2005, where he was named to Team USA in another limited role, not appearing in any games behind starter Rick DiPietro as they failed to earn a medal.\n\nEstablished as an NHL starter following the 2007–08 season, Thomas was named to his fifth World Championships in 2008. He appeared in three games before suffering a groin injury, splitting starts with Robert Esche and posting a 1.50 GAA with one shutout against Latvia in the preliminaries. The United States finished in sixth place.\n\nOn January 1, 2010, Thomas was selected to be a member of the United States men's hockey team for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, serving as backup goaltender to the Buffalo Sabres' Ryan Miller.\n\nOn February 26, 2010, Thomas made his Olympic debut in the United States–Finland semi-final, entering the game with approximately 11:30 remaining in the third period and a 6–0 lead. He replaced Ryan Miller to prevent any chance of injury to the American starter.\n\nThomas and wife Melissa have three children: two daughters and a son. Thomas is a Christian and a Libertarian, and has stated that the person he would most like to have dinner with is conservative TV pundit Glenn Beck. After winning the Stanley Cup in 2011, Thomas skipped the traditional victors' meet-and-greet with President Barack Obama at the White House on January 23, 2012; he was the only active Bruin not to attend. He released a statement regarding his absence:\n\nSince retiring from hockey, Thomas has resided in Sandpoint, Idaho.\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\nThomas runs several ice hockey camps in the Northeast United States during the NHL off-season for both goaltenders and skaters.\n\n"}

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Woodbridge north to the Chain Bridge across the Potomac River into Washington from Arlington. It goes by three local names. From its southern terminus to the Occoquan River Bridge, it is known as Gordon Boulevard. From the Occoquan River Bridge to the city of Fairfax it is known as Ox Road. From Fairfax to its intersection with I-495 in Tysons Corner it is known as Chain Bridge Road. East of Tysons, it is known as Dolley Madison Boulevard. SR 123 is a partial circumferential highway in Northern Virginia that connects Woodbridge in eastern Prince William County with the independent city of Fairfax and the Fairfax County communities of Vienna, Tysons Corner, and McLean, the last being the home of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Central Intelligence Agency. The state highway also connects all of the major highways that radiate from Washington, including Interstate 95, I-66, US 29, US 50, SR 267, and the George Washington Memorial Parkway. Furthermore, SR 123 crosses another pair of circumferential highways, I-495 and the Fairfax County Parkway, and SR 7, a major northwest–southeast highway through Northern Virginia. The state highway is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length.\n\nSR 123 begins at an intersection with US 1 (Jefferson Davis Highway) between the Woodbridge Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express station and US 1's bridge over the Occoquan River in Woodbridge. The state highway heads north as Gordon Boulevard, a four- to six-lane divided highway. SR 123 meets I-95 at a partial cloverleaf interchange that contains a reversible ramp to and from the Interstate's HOV lanes in the direction of Washington. There is no access from southbound I-95 to southbound SR 123; that movement is provided indirectly via I-95's interchange with US 1 across the river in Fairfax County. The Route 123 and I-95 Commuter Lot, a park and ride facility, is located within the southeast quadrant of this interchange. Past the interchange, the route heads east of the Occoquan Commuter Lot park and ride. The state highway passes through the eastern edge of the town of Occoquan and crosses the Occoquan River on a six-lane bridge.\nSR 123 continues into Fairfax County as Ox Road, which passes through the western part of Lorton. The state highway passes by the former Lorton Reformatory and reduces to four lanes north of SR 611 (Furnace Road). SR 123 passes northwest along the edge of the suburban communities of Laurel Hill, Crosspointe, and South Run. The state highway serves the park surrounding Burke Lake, then veers north through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 286 (Fairfax County Parkway) to the west of Burke Centre. SR 123 crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Washington District rail line, which also carries the Manassas Line of Virginia Railway Express, at Springfield.\n\nNorth of its intersection with SR 620 (Braddock Road), SR 123 passes along the west side of the campus of George Mason University, which includes the EagleBank Arena. The university's athletic complex, including George Mason Stadium, lies to the west of the state highway south of its intersection with University Drive, which heads east onto the campus as SR 383. North of University Drive, SR 123 enters the city of Fairfax and its name changes to Chain Bridge Road. The highway becomes undivided north of Judicial Drive; the state highway passes the Barbour House, the Historic Fairfax County Courthouse, and the Fairfax County offices and judicial center. North of SR 236 (Main Street), SR 123 reduces to two lanes and passes through an S-curve, then heads through a residential area before expanding to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with US 29 and US 50 (Fairfax Boulevard).\n\nSR 123 leaves the city of Fairfax at its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-66; the interchange includes a flyover ramp from westbound I-66 to southbound SR 123. The state highway curves northeast through Oakton, then enters the town of Vienna and becomes four-lane undivided Maple Avenue just south of its intersection with SR 243 (Nutley Street). SR 123 intersects the Washington and Old Dominion Trail adjacent to the Vienna Town Green. The state highway becomes a divided highway named Chain Bridge Road again on leaving the town limits and entering Tysons Corner, at the southwest edge of which SR 123 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 7 (Leesburg Pike). SR 123 expands to six lanes and begins to parallel Washington Metro's Silver Line and intersects SR 684 (International Drive) before passing between a pair of shopping malls: Tysons Galleria to the north and Tysons Corner Center to the south.\n\nAt the eastern edge of Tysons Corner, SR 123 passes under Westpark Drive has a cloverleaf interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway). The state highway, now named Dolley Madison Boulevard, follows the Silver Line northeast through office parks to a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 267 (Dulles Toll Road), which leads west to the Dulles Access Road (unsigned SR 90004) and Washington Dulles International Airport and east to I-66. There is no access from northbound SR 123 to westbound SR 267; that movement requires using I-495. North of the interchange, in the hamlet of Lewinsville, the state highway reduces to four lanes and intersects SR 694 (Lewinsville Road), which provides access to the National Counterterrorism Center. SR 123 passes through McLean, the center of which is accessed via SR 309 (Old Dominion Drive).\n\nEast of the center of McLean, SR 123 passes by the preserved Salona estate and close to Hickory Hill—a historic house on Chain Bridge Road that was home to Robert F. Kennedy—in Langley, where the state highway meets the eastern end of SR 193 (Old Georgetown Pike). That state highway provides access to the Claude Moore Colonial Farm on the campus of the George Bush Center for Intelligence, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. The agency's southern main entrance is on SR 123. East of its partial cloverleaf interchange with the George Washington Memorial Parkway, the state highway's name becomes Chain Bridge Road and reduces to two lanes as it descends into the valley of the Potomac River. SR 123 passes by the Marden House before entering the northwestern corner of Arlington County and meeting the northern end of SR 120 (Glebe Road). There, SR 123 turns north and crosses the Potomac River into Washington on the three-lane Chain Bridge, which leads to the Clara Barton Parkway into Maryland and Canal Road, which follows the river east to Georgetown.\n\nSR 123, along with SR 120, was SR 25 until the 1933 renumbering and SR 9 from then until the 1940 renumbering.\n\nFairfax County is considering upgrading the intersection between SR 123 and SR 620 to a full interchange. The designs being considered are diamond, modified diamond, single-point urban interchange (SPUI), and tight SPUI. Ultimately, one left turn lane in each direction of SR 123 was added at the intersection, the left turn lane on eastbound SR 620 was extended, and new traffic signals were installed.\n\nVDOT has drafted plans to create an interchange between SR 123 and US 1 in Woodbridge. However, due to budget cutbacks, the project has been put on hold.\n\nDue to work on I-66 in Fairfax County to add express lanes, SR 123 north's entrance to I-66 west has been temporarily changed from a loop ramp entrance to a left-turn entrance. \n\nVDOT is also working on reconstructing the interchange once the I-66 express lanes are complete. The existing interchange will be converted to a parclo-interchange for access to the I-66 express lanes, and a diamond interchange for access to the non-tolled I-66 lanes, with left exits and entrances for each direction of non-tolled I-66. The reconstruction is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. \n\nVDOT is currently working on improving the SR 123 bridges over SR 7. This would improve concrete-deck repairs, new asphalt overlay and paint jobs, and other repairs. The project is expected to cost $2.2 million and will be completed by end of 2020. VDOT started the project to help the bridge reach its expected lifespan, which is expected to be for 10-15 more years. \n\nFairfax County planners are also researching possible new configurations of the intersection in the future. Options include a quadrant roadway intersection and a continuous flow intersection. Fairfax County DOT has also considered building pedestrian space over the intersection, such as a park, to improve walkability in Tysons Corner. \n\n"}

It is sometimes referred to as one of the tallest waterfalls in Europe. The falls are on the Mardøla river which flows out of a hanging valley into the lake Eikesdalsvatnet, about northwest of the village of Eikesdalen. The waterfall was depicted in the coat of arms of the old Nesset Municipality.\n\nThe total fall is according to SSB, according to World Waterfall Database (WWD). WWD reports that the SSB typically includes the head measurement for waterfalls that are situated within a hydroelectric system, resulting in a greater height estimate. Mardalsfossen is a tiered waterfall consisting of two large drops and several smaller ones lower down. It is on average wide, but it can reach up to wide. The highest vertical drop is one of the tallest in Norway. As with figures for the total height, discrepancies have been reported in the estimated height of each vertical drop. According to the SSB, the upper vertical drop is , while the WWD surveyed it as .\n\nThe water, which has been tapped for hydroelectric use, flows over the falls during the summer tourist season of 20 June to 20 August. At other times the water is channeled through the hydroelectric scheme. The highest rate of flow ever recorded in the falls is . Summer flow is currently limited to less than .\n\nIn 1970 Arne Næss, the Norwegian founder of the Deep Ecology movement, tied himself with 300 others in protest against the building of a dam and the subsequent removal of the waterfall.\n\nBetween June 2014 and August 2015 Antony Gormley’s \"Another Time\" was on view in the mist from the waterfall and formed the official start of the Mardalsfossen Art Project.\n\nThe first element is from the name of the valley \"Mardalen\" and the last element is the finite form of \"foss\" which means \"waterfall\". The name of the valley is a compound of an old river name \"Mara\" (now Mardøla) and the finite form of \"dal\" which means \"dale\" or \"valley\". The old name of the river is probably derived from the verb \"mara\" which means \"rub\", \"grave\",\"dig\" or \"die.\"\n"}

The group has three members, (rap, keyboard and turntables), (rap and keyboards) and (rap).\n\nMalk de Koijn was formed on New Year's Eve 1993, when Geolo G proposed that they should make a band which was to become the best in the world. At that time, Tue Track and Geolo G had already worked together on several occasions. Blæs Bukki had been a part of the Danish producer team Madness 4 Real. In the group's first years they became popular among the underground scene with their prods (songs copied on cassette tapes) releasing songs like \"Lortesangen\" and \"Livet På Langestrand\".\n\nIn 1998 their first album \"Smash Hit in Aberdeen\" was launched. The style was different from the usual rap songs at that time - the group rapped about their imaginary universes in Aberdeen (not to be confused with the city in Scotland) and Langestrand, and the (often bizarre) humor was the most essential part of their songs. The critics liked the album and it was nominated for a Grammy - in 1999 the group also won Maarums Lyrikpris, a poetry prize.\n\nTheir second album \"Sneglzilla\" was released in 2002 and once again the album was very well received among fans and critics. The Danish music magazine \"Gaffa\" and two national papers, \"Politiken\" and \"Ekstra Bladet\", wrote that \"Sneglzilla\" was the best album of 2002, and it won two Danish Music Awards, two Steppeulve and six prizes at the Danish Hiphop Awards.\n\nThe band members often have \"alter-egos\" when performing, often wearing creative costumes at their sold-out concerts.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2011 the three members worked on other projects. Blæs Bukki, especially, has made a breakthrough with the Dancehall/ragga group Bikstok Røgsystem. Tue Track is working as producer under the name Track 72, and has released the album titled \"Rockin'\". He is also a part of the band Booty Cologne. Blæs Bukki and Geolo G also was a part of the play Peer Gynt in the Copenhagen Betty Nansen Theatre.\n\nIn 2006 Geolo G announced that he would retire completely from the music industry, thereby rendering a new album from the original Malk de Koijn-crew impossible. This later turned out to be untrue, as Malk de Koijn released a new album in 2011, \"Toback to the Fromtime\".\n\nMalk de Koijn was booked for the 2009 Roskilde Festival, much to the surprise of thousands of fans.\n\nMalk de Koijn played at the Arena Stage at the Roskilde Festival 2009, the night between Saturday and Sunday. The band stated in the Festival Newspaper that they preferred to play at the smaller Arena instead of Orange stage, this meaning an absolutely packed area in front of Arena, already 2 hours before the concert, when Fever Ray went on stage. Thousands of fans were gathered at the entrances to the pits. Some were in queue from 6PM and the field outside the tent was packed when the three rappers went on stage. During the concert, Geolo G started rumors that a new album was on the way by saying \"I think that was a new song we played there, I wonder if that means a new album\".\n\nMany years passed since the release of \"Sneglzilla\", and in 2010-11 the three rappers started getting together again for some jam sessions. Through this work-in-progress they realized they had to release another album, a decision that was hugely praised by fans.\n\nThe album became the latest masterpiece in hip hop, \"Toback to the Fromtime\", released September 19 2011.\nIt went straight to #1 on the Danish record sales chart.\n\nIn 2016 Tue Track recorded the album \"The Unreal Zound\" by using only material from the Danish rock group PowerSolo.\n\n\n\n\"Danish HipHop Awards 2003\"\n\n\"Danish Music Awards 2003\"\n\n\"P3 Guld 2003\"\n\n\"Årets Steppeulv 2003\"\n\n\"Årets Steppeulv 2012\"\n\n\"Danish Music Awards 2012\"\n\n"}

It was the result of a confluence of external and internal causes in what was then a Portuguese colony. The external inspiration was the independence of thirteen of the British colonies in North America following the American Revolutionary War, a development that impressed the intellectual elite of particularly the captaincy of Minas Gerais. The main internal cause of the conspiracy was the decline of gold mining in that captaincy. As gold became less plentiful, the region's gold miners faced increasing difficulties in fulfilling tax obligations to the crown, the tax over gold was one-fifth. When the captaincy could not satisfy the royal demand for gold, it was burdened with an additional tax on gold, called \"derrama\".\n\nConspirators seeking independence from Portugal planned to rise up in rebellion on the day that the \"derrama\" was instituted. However, the conspirators lacked both well-formed plans and an overall leader. Some of the conspirators were republicans, others were monarchists. Some favored the abolition of slavery, while others judged abolition as impractical at that time. The conspirators did put forth a few economic and social ideas: the promotion of cotton production, the exploitation of iron and saltpeter reserves, a proposal to give incentives to mothers to have many children, and the creation of a citizens' militia.\n\nThe conspiracy attracted a great number of military personnel, priests, and intellectuals, as well as the poets Cláudio Manuel da Costa and Tomás Antônio Gonzaga (1744–1807?). Among the best known participants were Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, best known as \"Tiradentes\"; José Álvares Maciel, philosopher and chemistry student; and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco de Paula Freire de Andrade (1756–1792) of the regiment of dragoons. Tiradentes, who came from Andrade's regiment, was the independence movement's most enthusiastic propagandist.\n\nThe Inconfidência was inspired by the ideals of the French liberal philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment and the successful American Revolution of 1776. The conspirators largely belonged to the white upper class of minerals-rich Minas Gerais. Many had studied in Europe, especially in the University of Coimbra, and some had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the ) was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. Many of the conspirators wanted to create a republic in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be São João del Rei, and Ouro Preto would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the right to property and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact. Eventually, three participants in the independence movement revealed the conspirators' plans to the government, and the rebels were arrested in 1789. Among the movement were the lawyer Alvarenga Peixoto, the poets Tomás Antônio Gonzaga and Cláudio Manuel da Costa, the priest José da Silva de Oliveira Rolim, and the \"alferes\" Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (a.k.a. \"Tiradentes\"). After Joaquim Silvério dos Reis (1756–1792), a member of the conspiracy, informed on the movement before it could take place, Peixoto was captured, arrested, and sent to exile in the city of Ambaca, in Portuguese Angola, another colony of the Portuguese Empire, where he remained until the end of his life.\n\nJudicial proceedings against the conspirators lasted from 1789 to 1792. Lieutenant Colonel Freire de Andrade, Tiradentes, José Álvares Maciel, and eight others were condemned to the gallows. Seven more were condemned to perpetual banishment in Africa, the rest were acquitted. Following the trial Queen Maria I commuted the sentences of capital punishment to perpetual banishment for all except those whose activities involved aggravated circumstances. That was the case for Tiradentes, who took full responsibility for the conspiracy movement and was imprisoned in Rio de Janeiro, where he was hanged on 21 April 1792. Afterwards, his body was torn into pieces, which were sent to Vila Rica in the captaincy of Minas Gerais, to be displayed in the places where he had propagated his revolutionary ideas. The anniversary of his death is celebrated as a national holiday in Brazil.\n\nIn 1948 the events were portrayed in a film \"Minas Conspiracy\" directed by Carmen Santos.\n\nIn 1963, Minas Gerais incorporated as its state flag the one designed by the Inconfidência, with an equilateral triangle inspired by the Holy Trinity – albeit supposedly the inconfidentes wanted a green triangle, while Minas' flag uses a red one – and a Latin motto taken out of Vergil's \"Eclogues\".\n\n\n"}

The civil parish lies on a ragstone ridge situated between the North Downs and the Weald of Kent and has commonly been called Quarry Hills. The village itself is located south of the town of Maidstone.\n\nThe village name comes from a corruption of the name of the Norman family given the manor after the Conquest: \"Montchensie\" who held the manor until 1287 and the Anglo Saxon Boc Tun (Beech Tree settlement). The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Boltone, then Bouton, Bocton, and probably via Bocton de Montchensie to the current Boughton Monchelsea. The suffix using the family name seems to have been added in this area of Kent, possibly to differentiate multiple Boctuns.\n\nSome of the earliest history of Boughton Monchelsea is in the Iron Age settlement at Quarry Wood Camp (Camp Field). There are traces of an outer rampart on Parsonage Farm (on the edge of Park Wood) constructed by the Belgae about 40 AD, possibly as a defence against the Roman invasion in 43 AD.\n\nThe foundations of a Roman bathhouse were discovered in 1841 near Brishing Court, also a Roman villa at Brishing and a cemetery at Lockham. The quarries were worked extensively in Roman times and the villa and bathhouse could well have belonged to the quarry owner. Ragstone (a type of sandstone) was worked here; stone for the building of Westminster Abbey, the present-day Houses of Parliament and the repair of Rochester Castle came from here. The last quarry closed in 1960.\n\nThe village church, dedicated to St Peter, was built around 1100.\nThere is a notable fourteenth century Lych-gate at the Churchyard.\nThe village has a village green, a primary school, a village hall, a recreation ground, one public house and a post office among its amenities.\n\nThe 16th-century Elizabethan stone-built former manor house, Boughton Monchelsea Place, is situated in a private deer park and remains a private dwelling although it is occasionally opened for commercial use as a venue for weddings and business conferences.\n\nA similar property at nearby Wierton Place has in recent years operated as a polo and country club as well as an exclusive out-of-town nightclub. Prior to that it was the official residence of judges when on circuit at Maidstone Crown Court.\n\nOther historic houses include the Grade II listed Tanyard, Brishing Court and Lewis Court.\n\nThe Cock Inn, dating back to 1568, is situated at the junction of Heath Road and Brishing Lane. Featured in the classic 1949 film \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" starring Sir Alec Guinness and Dennis Price, The Cock is a typical old English pub featuring inglenooks, exposed beams and low ceilings.\n\nBoughton is also the home of the artist Graham Clarke.\n\n\n\nThe kit car manufacturer GKD Sports Cars is based in Boughton Monchelsea with its workshops in nearby Lenham.\n"}

{"id": "2168055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168055", "title": "Palinopsia", "text": "Palinopsia\n\nPalinopsia (Greek: \"palin\" for \"again\" and \"opsia\" for \"seeing\") is the persistent recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed. Palinopsia is not a diagnosis, it is a diverse group of pathological visual symptoms with a wide variety of causes. Visual perseveration is synonymous with palinopsia.\n\nIn 2014, Gersztenkorn and Lee comprehensively reviewed all cases of palinopsia in the literature and subdivided it into two clinically relevant groups: illusory palinopsia and hallucinatory palinopsia. Hallucinatory palinopsia, usually due to seizures or posterior cortical lesions, describes afterimages that are formed, long-lasting, and high resolution. Illusory palinopsia, usually due to migraines, head trauma, prescription drugs, or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), describes afterimages that are affected by ambient light and motion and are unformed, indistinct, or low resolution.\n\nPeople with palinopsia frequently report other visual illusions and hallucinations such as photopsias, dysmetropsia i.e. Alice in Wonderland syndrome (micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, and pelopsia), visual snow, oscillopsia, entoptic phenomena, and cerebral polyopia.\n\nPosterior visual pathway cortical lesions (tumor, abscess, hemorrhage, infarction, arteriovenous malformation, cortical dysplasia, aneurysm) and various seizure causes (hyperglycemia, ion channel mutations, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, idiopathic seizures, etc.) cause focal cortical hyperactivity or hyperexcitability, resulting in inappropriate, persistent activation of a visual memory circuit.\nIllusory palinopsia is a dysfunction of visual perception, resulting from diffuse, persistent alterations in neuronal excitability that affect physiological mechanisms of light or motion perception. Illusory palinopsia is caused by migraines, HPPD, prescription drugs, head trauma, or may be idiopathic. Trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, topiramate, clomiphene, oral contraceptives, and risperidone have been reported to cause illusory palinopsia. A patient frequently has multiple types of illusory palinopsia, which represent dysfunctions in both light and motion perception. Light and motion are processed via different pathways, suggesting diffuse or global excitability alterations.\n\nPalinopsia is a pathological symptom and should be distinguished from physiological afterimages, a common and benign phenomenon. Physiological afterimages appear when viewing a bright stimulus and shifting visual focus. For example, after staring at a computer screen and looking away, a vague afterimage of the screen remains in the visual field. A stimulus consistently produces the same afterimage, which is dependent on the stimulus intensity and contrast, the time of fixation, and the retinal adaptation state. Physiological afterimages are usually the complementary color of the original stimulus (negative afterimage), while palinoptic afterimages are usually the same color as the original stimulus (positive afterimage). There is some ambiguity between illusory palinopsia and physiological afterimages since there are not concrete symptomatic criteria which determines if an afterimage is pathological.\n\nIllusory palinopsia is due to an abnormality in the original perception of a stimulus and is similar to a visual illusion: the distorted perception of a real external stimulus. Hallucinatory palinopsia is due to an abnormality after a stimulus has been encoded in visual memory and is similar to a complex visual hallucination: the creation of a formed visual image where none exists.\n\nExternal conditions such as stimulus intensity, background contrast, fixation, and movement typically affect the generation and severity of illusory palinopsia but not hallucinatory palinopsia. Illusory palinopsia consists of afterimages that are short-lived or unformed, occur in the same location in the visual field as the original stimulus, and are continuous or predictable. Hallucinatory palinopsia describes formed afterimages and scenes that are lifelike, high-resolution, long-lasting, occur anywhere in the visual field, and are unpredictable. Illusory palinopsia are caused by diffuse neuronal pathology such as global alterations in neurotransmitter receptors, while hallucinatory palinopsia is typically caused by focal cortical pathology.\n\nThe clinical characteristics that separate illusory from hallucinatory palinopsia also help differentiate and assess risk in visual illusions and hallucinations. Complex (formed) visual hallucinations are more worrisome than simple visual hallucinations or visual illusions.\n\nResearch needs to be performed on the efficacy of the various pharmaceuticals for treating illusory palinopsia. It is unclear if the symptoms' natural history and treatment are influenced by the cause. It is also not clear if there is treatment efficacy overlap for illusory palinopsia and the other co-existing diffuse persistent illusory phenomenon such as visual snow, oscillopsia, dysmetropsia, and halos.\n\nFuture advancements in fMRI could potentially further our understanding of hallucinatory palinopsia and visual memory. Increased accuracy in fMRI might also allow for the observation of subtle metabolic or perfusional changes in illusory palinopsia, without the use of ionizing radiation present in CT scans and radioactive isotopes. Studying the psychophysics of light and motion perception could advance our understanding of illusory palinopsia, and vice versa. For example, incorporating patients with visual trailing into motion perception studies could advance our understanding of the mechanisms of visual stability and motion suppression during eye movements (e.g. saccadic suppression).\n"}

Located in the Amhara Region, it sits at a latitude and longitude of , with an elevation between 2,470 and 2,550 metres above sea level.\n\nPrior to Dessie's foundation, the major settlement in this area was Wasal, first mentioned in an early 16th-century Italian itinerary.\n\nEmperor Yohannes IV was camping in the highlands to the west of the Chefa Valley in 1882 on an expedition to forcefully convert the Muslim Wollo who lived in the region to Christianity. As he was looking for a place to centralize his power in the newly conquered region of Wollo, he stayed overnight in a pre-existing town that is now contained within Dessie. While there, he spotted a comet. He was so impressed by the sight of it that he interpreted it to be a sign from heaven to found his capital city there. Thus, he named it Dessie (Amharic \"My Joy\"), as a reference to the elation that the comet had made him feel.\n\nDessie's location led to the telegraph line the Italians constructed between 1902 and 1904 from Asmara south to Addis Ababa passing through the city, and giving it a local telegraph office. Also in 1904, the Italian Giuseppe Bonaiuti took part in constructing a fair-weather road connecting the city to Addis Ababa.\n\nDessie increased in importance when Ras Mikael Ali, son-in-law to Emperor Menelik II, made it his base. The city was where his son, would-be emperor Iyasus V, crowned Mikael negus around 1915. During his residence in Dessie, the Negus built a palace and the church Enda Medhane Alem, said to be placed on the site of a church destroyed by Imam Ahmed Gragn. The church is decorated with paintings which include portraits of Ras Mikael and his son.\n\nAfter the defeat of his father Negus Mikael, Lij Iyasu took refuge in Dessie beginning on 8 November 1916 while unsuccessfully seeking support from Ras Wolde Giyorgis and other major nobles of northern Ethiopia. However, Ras Wolde Giyorgis used these overtures to extract concessions from the central government, then marched on Dessie which Lij Iyasu fled 10 December.\n\nDuring the Italian invasion, Dessie was first bombed 6 December 1935; the American Hospital was one of the buildings damaged in the attack. Emperor Haile Selassie was photographed personally machine-gunning the raiding planes. The city was occupied by the Italians 15 April 1936.\n\nDessie became an important administrative center under the Italian occupation, and the Franciscans established in 1937 the Latin Catholic missionary Apostolic Prefecture of Dessié, which would be suppressed in 1957 after its only prefect's death.\n\nThe Italian garrison of the city surrendered 26 April 1941 to Brigadier Pienaar's 1st South African Brigade and 500 arbegnoch, and after the Second World War, the town continued in importance as the capital of the province of Wollo until the province's abolition in 1995.\n\nIn a decree of 1942, Dessie is listed as one of only six \"Schedule A\" municipalities in Ethiopia, while there were about a hundred in \"Schedule B\". Artist Essaye Gebre-Medhin Fikre was born in Dessie in 1949. He gained a B.A. in Addis Ababa and an M.A. in Paris but was self-taught as an artist. In 1955, a public address system was installed in the central square which was used to re-broadcast announcements on Radio Addis Ababa to the public. In 1957, Dessie had one of 9 provincial secondary schools (excluding Eritrea) in Ethiopia, named after Woizero Sehine the daughter of Negus Mikael.\n\nIn February 1973, a crowd of 1,500 peasants marched from Dessie to the capital to make the authorities notice the famine in Wollo. They were stopped by police on the outskirts of Addis Ababa and forced to return. Following the Ethiopian revolution, one of the few major encounters between rebels and government forces took place north-west of Dessie in October 1976. Instigated by the local landlord, a large group of peasants marched on the city; troops of the Derg fired into the crowd. Reports of the death toll vary widely, from several hundred to nearly a thousand. In October 1989 Dessie was almost captured by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The EPRDF took permanent control of the city on 18 May 1990, as part of Operation Wallelign.\n\nDessie is home to a museum, in the former home of Dejazmach Yoseph Birru. It also has a zawiya of the Qadiriyya order of Islam, which was the first Sufi order to be introduced into north-east Africa.\n\nBased on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), Dessie woreda has a total population of 151,174, of whom 72,932 are men and 78,242 women; 120,095 or 79.44% are urban inhabitants living in the town of Dessie, the rest of the population is living at rural kebeles around Dessie. The majority of the inhabitants were[Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity], with 58.62% reporting that as their religion, while 39.92% of the population said they practiced [Muslim and 1.15% were Protestants.\n\nThe 1994 national census reported a total population for Dessie of 97,314 in 17,426 households, of whom 45,337 were men and 51,977 were women. The two largest ethnic groups reported in this town were the Amhara (92.83%) and the Tigrayan (4.49%); all other ethnic groups made up 2.68% of the population.\nAmharic was spoken as a first language by 94.89% and 3.79% spoke Tigrinya; the remaining 0.67% spoke all other primary languages reported.\n\nThe 2007 national census reported 59% of the inhabitants practiced Christianity with 41% of the population having reported they practiced Islam .\n\nThe 1994 national census reported 63% of the inhabitants professed Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity with 37% of the population having reported they practiced Islam.\n\nThe small Eastern Catholic minority is part of the Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Bahir Dar–Dessie.\n\nDessie is located along Ethiopian Highway 2. It has postal service (a post office was established in the 1920s), and telephone service from at least as early as 1954. The city has had electrical power since at least 1963 when a new diesel-powered electric power station with a power line to Kombolcha was completed, at a cost of Eth$ 110,000. Intercity bus service is provided by the Selam Bus Line Share Company. Dessie shares Combolcha Airport (ICAO code HADC, IATA DSE) with neighbouring Kombolcha.\n\nDessie is located at an altitude of above sea level in low-shrouded mountains and hills. Dessie has a subtropical highland climate (\"Cwb\"). More to the east, there is a hot semi-arid climate (\"Bsh\").\n\nDessie is known to be a part of the Wollo culture, thus having a style of cultural clothing, as well as significant dances. Men's traditional clothing is similar to most of amhara region of Ethiopia. Women's traditional clothing includes a habesha kemis, which is the name of the dress, as well as a matching scarf, sometimes two, one tied around the waist and the other over the hair.\n"}

On 19 November 1989 the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) claimed to have captured Kombolcha. However, the highway from Kombolcha to Assab was not fully brought under TPLF control until the Derg was expelled from Tigray later that year.\n\nBased on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), Kombolcha woreda has a total population of 85,367, of whom 41,968 are men and 43,399 women; 58,667 or 68.72% are urban inhabitants living in town of Kombolcha, the rest of population is living at rural kebeles around Kombolcha.

{"id": "2168087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168087", "title": "History of Marshall, Texas", "text": "History of Marshall, Texas\n\nThe History of Marshall, Texas follows the city; from its founding as an administrative center of the Republic of Texas, through its rise to be one of the largest cities in the early State of Texas, to its emergence as a major Confederate city, to its establishment as a major railroad hub of the United States in the late 19th century, through its national influence on the American Civil Rights Movement, through its steady economic decline in the late 20th century, and to the reemergence of growth in the 1990s and early 21st century.\n\nMarshall's history began when the area that is now Marshall received its first known settlers in 1839. While activities among Caddos, and other Southeastern Native American peoples certainly took place in the area that is now Marshall, no known settlement existed at Marshall, as was the case of the original location of neighboring Elysian Fields.\n\nIn 1841 a new seat was sought for Harrison County, and a local settler named Peter Whetstone, offered some of his land in central Harrison County to build the new city on. He offered to build a church and a school on and the subsequently divide the remaining land into 190 lots. County commissioners were initially concerned that the water in the area would not be good—the reason from moving the county seat from sites on the Sabine River like Pulaski was that they had poor water, were prone to disease, and flooding. Whetstone is alleged to have convinced the commissioners that the water was good by pulling a jug of whiskey out from a hollow in an oak tree in what is now downtown Marshall. He passed around the jug, and convinced the commissioners to build on the site; either by convincing them that the whiskey (and water) were good, getting them drunk, or both. However it is important to note that some historians view this account as embellished or untrue.\n\nWhetstone's friend Isaac Van Zandt, laid out the city and named it in honor of John Marshall. The city was formally incorporated in 1841 by the Republic of Texas. The city quickly became a major city in the state, because of its position as a gateway to Texas on several major stage coach lines. The city's growing importance was strengthened when Marshall was linked by a telegraph line to New Orleans, becoming the first city in Texas to have a telegraph service. Several academies sprang up, many of them supported by Whetstone, who, ironically, was illiterate.\n\nBy 1860 the city was the fifth largest city in Texas, the \"first metropolis of East Texas with a population of about 2,000\", according to Randoph B. Campbell author of \"Gone to Texas\", and the seat of the richest county. The county had more slaves than any other in the state, making it a hotbed of anti-Union sentiment. In the 1850s there were so many skilled slaves in Marshall, that white mechanics organized to protest that work was being taken away from \"free\" workers. When Gov. Sam Houston refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Marshall's Edward Clark was sworn in as governor. Marshall would also produce Texas' third Confederate governor, Pendleton Murrah. Marshall became a major Confederate city, becoming the capital of Missouri's Confederate government-in-exile, producing gunpowder and other supplies for the Confederate Army, and hosting three conferences of Trans-Mississippi and Indian Territory leaders.\n\nMarshall became the seat of civil authority and headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi Postal Department after the fall of Vicksburg. The city would remain influential in the Confederacy throughout the war, as a power center west of the Mississippi, which hosted Confederate governors during the Marshall Conferences in 1862, 1863, and 1865. The city may have been the intended target of a failed Union advance that was rebuffed at Mansfield, Louisiana. Towards the end of the Civil War Richmond had $9 million in Treasury notes and $3 million in postage stamps shipped to Marshall, possibly meaning that Marshall was the intended destination of a government preparing to flee from advancing armies. With high desertion among the Confederate army in the final days of the war, the Confederate powder mill at Marshall was abandoned to looters.\n\nMarshall was occupied by Union forces on June 17, 1865, two days before the force, made famous by Juneteenth, arrived at Galveston. During Reconstruction the city was home to an office of the Freedmen's Bureau and was the base for Union troops. In 1873 The Methodist Episcopal Church founded Wiley College to educate free men. African-Americans came to the city seeking opportunities and protection until 1878, when the \"Citizens Party\", led by former Confederate General Walter P. Lane and his brother George, took control of the city and county governments and ran Unionists, Republicans and many African-Americans out of town. The Lanes ultimately declared Marshall and Harrison County \"redeemed\" from Union and African-American control. Despite this the African-American community would continue to progress with the establishment of Bishop College in 1881 and the certification of Wiley by the Freedman's Aid Society in 1882.\n\nMarshall's \"Railroad Era\" began in the early 1870s. Harrison County citizens voted to offer $300,000 bond subsidy, and the City of Marshall offered to donate land north of the downtown to the Texas and Pacific Railway if the company would move to Marshall. T&P President Jay Gould accepted and located the T&P's workshops and general offices for Texas in Marshall. The city benefited immediately from a population explosion. By 1880 the city was one of the South's largest cotton markets. The city's new prosperity became apparent when the first department store in Texas, J. Weisman and Co., opened in 1878. Many Jews, too, moved to Marshall following the arrival of the railroad and a temple was erected in 1900.\nDuring this period of wealth many of the city's now historic homes were constructed. Homes such as \"Maplecroft\", commissioned by James F. Starr. The 1871 Starr home is a two-story frame, late Greek Revival structure with some Victorian styling. Craftsmen, such as shipwrights, and building materials were shipped from New Orleans to Marshall.\n\nMarshall Pottery was founded by W. F. Rocker in Marshall in 1895. Rocker located the business in East Texas because of its abundant water and white clay deposits.\n\nDespite the prosperity of the railroad era, poverty continued to be a problem in the city among all races, but tensions between whites and African-Americans continued to worsen as segregation crystallized in the city. The rural areas of Harrison County saw greater interaction between white people and African-Americans. There, whites and blacks being neighbors was commonplace. Even though the areas surrounding Marshall were somewhat integrated, racism certainly was still apparent in everyday life. The fact that several planters divided up sizable tracts of land and gave them to their former slaves may also have contributed to these tensions.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, children of both races were raised to accept the status quo of segregation. African American Marshall resident George Dawson later wrote about his childhood experiences with segregation in his book \"Life Is So Good\". He described how, despite African American children's acceptance of segregation, in some instances its demands were too outrageous to follow. For example, Dawson described how he had refused the demand of one employer who expected him to eat with her dogs.\n\n1913-02-25: Two African Americans were lynched in Marshall this date. Robert Perry was shot to death by a mob after being accused of horse stealing. Another African American, by the family name of Anderson, was hanged by a mob for unknown reasons.\n\n1914-04-29: Charles Fisher, a young African-American resident of Marshall, was accused of hugging and kissing the daughter of a white farmer. News of the incident spread widely, and a lynch mob was formed. Fisher was found, kidnapped, and mutilated both physically and sexually, and then released. Fisher was later examined by Sheriff Sanders and County Health Officer Taylor, who found that the mob had sheared off Mr. Fisher's ears, slit his lips, and mutilated his genitals. Fisher survived, but never totally recovered. None of the mob was ever captured.\n\nOther known victims of lynching from this time period include:\n\nIn 1949, Marshall banned the movie \"Pinky\" from the city because it portrayed an interracial couple, a violation of the city's censorship code. The city was sued and the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned the city's censorship law.\nThree graduates of Wiley College, inspired by the teachings of Wiley professor Melvin B. Tolson, helped to dismantle Jim Crow at the county, state, and national levels. Fred Lewis, as the secretary of the Harrison County NAACP, challenged the oldest White Citizens Party in the Texas and the Jim Crow laws it enforced, ultimately abolishing Jim Crow in the county with the \"Perry v. Cyphers\" verdict. Heman Sweatt tried to enroll in the University of Texas Law school, but was denied entry because of the color of his skin; he sued and the Texas Supreme Court ordered the desegregation of postgraduate studies in Texas in the \"Sweatt v. Painter\" decision. James L. Farmer, Jr. became an organizer of the Freedom Rides and a founder of the Congress of Racial Equality.\n\nThe progression of civil rights would continue into the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In the 1960s, students organized the first sit-ins in Texas in the rotunda of the county courthouse on Whetstone Square in a move to end segregation of public schools; in 1970, all Marshall public schools were integrated. Also in that year, Carolyn Abney became the first woman to be elected to the city commission. In April 1975, local businessman Sam Birmingham became the first African-American to be elected to the city commission and, in the 1980s, Marshall's first African-American mayor. Birmingham retired in 1989 for health concerns, and was succeeded by his wife, Jean Birmingham, who became the first African-American woman to serve on the commission.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the Texas & Pacific Railroad experienced its height under the leadership of John L. Lancaster. Marshall's industry picked up with the discovery of what was then the largest oil field in the world at nearby Kilgore in 1930. Marshall's railroad industry subsequently declined with the dieselization of most trains, the proliferation of air travel, and the construction of the Interstate highway system after World War II. The T&P Shops closed in the 1960s and T&P passenger service ceased in 1970. The Texas oil bust of the 1980s devastated the local economy and the city's population declined by about a thousand between 1980 and 1990.\n"}

Known as Georgetown Pike, the state highway runs from SR 7 in Dranesville east to SR 123 in Langley. SR 193 passes through Great Falls and meets Interstate 495 (I-495) in McLean. The state highway was designated the first Virginia Byway for its scenic value in 1974.\n\nSR 193 begins at an intersection with SR 7 (Leesburg Pike) in Dranesville. The state highway heads east as a two-lane road and passes between many of the affluent residential subdivisions of Great Falls. After passing through the village center of Great Falls at Walker Road, SR 193 turns east-southeast and follows the edge of Great Falls Park. The state highway features many sharp curves as it drops into the stream valley of Difficult Run. SR 193 passes through several curves as the highway skirts residential subdivisions, passes the Madeira School, and crosses Bullneck Run and Scott Run. The state highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway around its interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway) in McLean. After passing Langley High School and Chain Bridge Road, the old alignment of SR 123, SR 193 reaches its eastern terminus at SR 123 (Dolley Madison Boulevard).\n\nWhen first constructed, the Georgetown Pike continued through the District of Columbia's Alexandria County (now Arlington County, Virginia) to the banks of the Potomac. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nThe listing describes Georgetown Pike as located in both Fairfax and Arlington Counties, Virginia. Beginning at the boundary of the District of Columbia and Arlington County at Chain Bridge on the south bank of the Potomac River, it extends .4 miles to cross the Fairfax County line, then continues 14 miles in an approximately northwesterly direction to meet the Leesburg Pike near Dranesville in Fairfax County. After beginning the ascent from Chain Bridge, the river is never again visible from the road, although it passes so close to the river at Great Falls that the roar of the water can be heard. The Georgetown Pike roadbed is approximately 20- to 24-feet wide within a 50- to 60-foot-wide right-of-way as built in 1813-1827. A crowned and graduated stone highway, constructed according to a modified Tresauget system, the Georgetown Pike surpassed the standards of the enabling legislation of both the U. S. Congress and the Assembly of Virginia. John Mason, Jr., president of the Falls Bridge Turnpike Company, wrote to the Board of Public Works in 1820 that the roadbed was \"paved with large stone, closely fitted together, 12 inches deep in the centre, falling off to 6 inches on the sides, and covered with broken stone 6 inches deep from side to side; making 18 inches stone in the centre, and twelve inches on the sides; the whole is covered with sand, gravel or clay, as was found most convenient.\"1 This substantial method of construction has served the road well, as it has survived flooding, war, neglect, and adaptation for automobile traffic. The Georgetown Pike is a road built in conformance with the most advanced engineering expertise and construction resources of the early nineteenth century. Men using hand tools and horse-drawn equipment formed the roadbed, clearing, blasting, plowing, scooping, and filling the rough terrain. Stone retaining walls, culverts, arches, and bridges were built where necessary, working within the context of the natural terrain to the extent possible. An original road bridge with stone and brick viaduct at Bull Neck Run, and a massive stone retaining wall at Pimmit Run in Arlington County are notable survivors. John Templeman, builder of the Potomac Chain Bridge in 1808, served as superintendent of the road from December 1, 1817, to April 30, 1818. He designed and built an additional chain bridge to carry the Pike over Difficult Run. Though this bridge is not extant, it was described by Mason as \"220 feet long, and 20 feet wide; it stands on two large stone abutments, and three stone piers 18 feet high; is further supported by three ranges of chains, extending from end to end, resting on the stone piers; and has supports of strong upright timbers between the piers where necessary.\"\n\nFrom 1940 to 1963, Georgetown Pike's eastern terminus was at its intersection with Chain Bridge Road, which then continued east along the Pike's alignment to the Potomac. In 1963, Virginia completed the Dolley Madison Boulevard bypass in the McLean area, as an alternative to widening both the existing Chain Bridge Road and Georgetown Pike. John F. Kennedy, who owned the Hickory Hill property at the intersection of the two roads, requested the alignment south of his property. Georgetown Pike was then extended east along its previous alignment to the new boulevard, which kept the name Chain Bridge Road from there to the Potomac.\n\n"}

Its staff split in 1864 under the leadership of Max Friedländer, Michael Etienne and Adolf Werthner to form the \"Neue Freie Presse\", which later was aryanized by the Nazis in 1938 and effectively closed in 1939. In 1946, after the Second World War, resistance fighter Ernst Molden, who had been vice-editor-in-chief of the \"Neue Freie Presse\" from 1921 until 1939, reestablished the newspaper as \"Die Presse\".\n\nThe \"\"Presse\"\" had been struggling for financial survival for a long time, until during the 1960s, the Austrian Chamber of Commerce became the main shareholder. Since 1999 it has been owned by the Styria Medien AG, a conservative-liberal media group founded by the Catholic Church. Its publisher is Die Presse Verlag GmbH.\n\nThe paper covers general news topics. It is frequently quoted in international media concerning news from Austria. Since March 2009 it has also been operating a weekly newspaper under the name \"\"Die Presse am Sonntag\"\". The daily covers half-page science news each day.\n\nThe political position of the \"\"Die Presse\"\" can be described as classical liberal, with a strong emphasis on free-market economy and small government, traditionally opposing Austria's grand coalition and its neocorporatist tendencies. It therefore stands in contrast to other Austrian newspapers of quality including the more conservative \"Wiener Zeitung\" and the social-liberal \"Der Standard\". Emphasis is put on the 1848 revolutions as the beginning of its tradition as a liberal newspaper, citing it in its slogan \"\"Free since 1848\"\". Despite its liberal free-market orientation, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote a series of articles on the American Civil War for \"Die Presse\" in the early 1860s, which were later collected into the book \"The Civil War in the United States\".\n\nIn 2007 the editor-in-chief of \"Die Presse\" was Michael Fleischhacker who had been appointed to the post in 2004. Next year the paper was named Best Editorial Team in Austria.\n\nIn 2002 \"Die Presse\" was one of four quality daily newspapers with nationwide distribution along with \"Der Standard\", \"Salzburger Nachrichten\", and \"Wiener Zeitung\". The same year its circulation was 120,000 copies. In 2004 the paper had a circulation of 115,000 copies.\n\nThe 2007 circulation of \"Die Presse\" was 121,000 copies. The circulation of the daily was 120,363 copies in 2008 and 102,598 copies in 2009. It was 97,091 copies in 2010. The paper had a circulation of 74,032 copies in 2011. Its circulation was 80,000 copies in 2013.\n\nIn 2009, reports claimed that the \"\"Presse\"\"'s long-time editor, Otto Schulmeister, had been working for the CIA in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n\n"}

Located southwest of Jimma in the Keffa Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region upon a hill in the upper Barta valley, it has a latitude and longitude of with an elevation of 1,714 meters above sea level. It is surrounded by Ginbo woreda. Bonga is the administrative center of the Keffa Zone, with a major market on Saturday and lesser ones on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Note that there is another town in Ethiopia named \"Bonga\", near Gambela.\n\nThe neighboring area is known for hot springs, caves and waterfalls. There are fourteenth century ruins associated with the former Kingdom of Kaffa. As part of the extensive road-building program started before the Italian invasion, the Ethiopian Transport Company built a large steel bridge at Bonga. The all-weather road from Jimma south to Bonga was completed around 1962. The road to Mizan Teferi and Tepi was improved in 1966 by the Highway Authority. The Apostolic Prefecture of Jimma–Bonga is based in this town.\n\nAccording to the SNNPR's Bureau of Finance and Economic Development, Bonga's amenities include digital telephone access, postal service, 24-hour electrical service, a bank and a hospital. The high school draws students from a broad area. The city is a center for the buying of honey, coffee and cardamom.\n\nBonga is thought to be the oldest city in the general region of Welega Province.\n\nThe first European recorded to have visited the capital of the former Kingdom of Kaffa was Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie, who resided for 11 days in the marketplace reserved for Christian traders in 1843. The royal residence at Bonga was not as elegant as those in Gomma, Gera, and Limmu-Ennarea. Capuchin monks founded a mission there in 1845 and discovered some medieval churches which remained as evidence of the early infiltration of Christian influence before the invasion of the Oromo.\n\nWhen Paul Soleillet visited Bonga in the 1880s, he described its trade as primarily slaves, coffee, civet cat oil, coriander and ivory, the turnover amounting between 200,000 and 300,000 dollars a year. Following the conquest of Kaffa by the generals of Menelik II in 1897, Bonga was deserted; governor Ras Wolde Giyorgis made neighboring Anderaccha his capital.\n\nBonga was occupied 13 December 1936 by the Italians under General Malta, who died there the next year on 30 May. He and his successor Colonel Corrado refounded Bonga as a local administrative and commercial center for the production of coffee, hides, wax, maize, tea, etc. By 1938, there were about 3,000 inhabitants in the town, of whom about 200 were Italians, and it was equipped with a post office, telegraph, hospital, pharmacy, and \"spacci\". There were few remains of early constructions, but the new settlement was well built from brick and tufa, covered by clay tiles or corrugated iron. Generals Bortello and Tosti, commanders of the Italian forces south of the Didessa River acknowledged their weak position and along with 2,850 troops on 28 June 1941 surrendered to Lt. Col. McNab of the King's African Rifles.\n\nTelephone service reached Bonga between 1954 and 1967. Around 1970, there lived in Bonga one Idebe Godo who was the chief priest of a spirit possession cult. The high priesthood was hereditary to the family of the former high priests to the King of Kaffa.\n\nBased on the 2007 Census conducted by the CSA, this town has a total population of 20,858, of whom 10,736 are men and 10,122 women. The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 72.53% of the population reporting that belief. 11.17% were Muslim, 9.85% were Protestants, and 6.18% were Catholics.\n\nThe 1994 census reported it had a total population of 10,851 of whom 5,032 were men and 5,819 women.\n\nBonga is also home to many Uduk refugees from South Sudan.\n\nIn 2009, constructions for a National Coffee Museum started. Next to the National Coffee Museum lies the Kafa Biosphere Reserve Information Center where visitors can learn about flora and fauna of the region. \nKafa Biosphere Reserve is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 2010. It is the birthplace of wild Arabica coffee and is very rich in biodiversity. \n\n"}
{"id": "2168145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168145", "title": "Candleston Castle", "text": "Candleston Castle\n\nCandleston Castle is a 14th-century fortified manor house, in ruins since the 19th century. It is southwest of Merthyr Mawr, former Glamorgan, Wales, now Bridgend county borough and just northwest of Ogmore Castle, separated by the River Ogmore. Candleston's original long and narrow rectangular structure lay across the western end of a low narrow promontory, suggesting a defensive position. The castle is believed to be named after the Norman family of Cantilupe, thought to be its first feudal tenants.\n\nThe ruins of Candleston, which had been part of a medieval settlement, stand on the Merthyr Mawr Sand Dunes, on the edge of the Merthyr Mawr Warren. They are east of Porthcawl off of Swansea Bay.\n\nIn the 12th century, Candleston manor passed to the St Quintin lords of Talyfan and Llanbleddian; The Cantilupe family are considered Candleston's first tenants. Although there are no records to show that the de Cantilupes were at the site in the 12th century, it is believed that the name Candleston is derived from their name, variously spelled Cantulupo, Cantilupo, Cantelo. In 1596 it was called Cantelowstowne and in 1635 Cantloston. It was Tregantlow in Welsh, Tref or Tre meaning town.\n\nCandleston Castle, a fortified manor, was built in the 14th century. An enclosure, in the shape of a D, surrounded the structure. The late-medieval manor may have been constructed on the site of a previous building, based upon the presence of remnants of an earlier wall. The castle may have been built by Robert de Canteilupe III, who owned one ploughland at Candleston in 1320 according to the Despenser Survey of Glamorgan of that year. Robert III, who is not recorded after 1320, may have been succeeded by John de Cantilupe, who may have been the Abbot of Margam in 1315. Robert de Cantilupe III's daughter Joan, heiress of Candleston, married Sir William Horton of Tregwynt, Pembrokeshire.\n\nSands from the dunes shifted starting in the late 14th century and encroached on nearby Kenfig Castle, resulting in its evacuation. The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales reported that Candleston's \"elevated position was just sufficient to save it from the encroaching sand dunes on the northern fringe of the Merthyr Mawr Warren, which entirely surrounded the promontory and formed a relatively stable margin close to the southern wall of the castle.\"\n\nCandleston passed through Joan Cantilupe Horton and Sir William Horton's son Jenkin, who may not have resided at Candleston, to Jenkin's daughter Jennet or Janet. The manor then went to the Cradocks when Janet married Richard Cradock about 1468. Nicholas Horton briefly resided at Candleston and paid a small quit rent in 1411 for what is believed to be Candleston to the lord of Merthyr Mawr.\n\nJoan Robert, reported to be the daughter of Margaret Cantilupe, married John Eyre. In 1412 and 1429, Eyre is recorded as Candleston's landholder. Janet Horton and Richard Cradock received Candleston, possibly because the Eyres did not have children or due to the nature of their tenure.\n\nJanet and Richard Cradock's son, Sir Mathew Cradock (about 1468–1531) inherited the property. During his career, he was steward of Gower, Chancellor of Glamorgan and constable for life of the Kenfig and Caerphilly castles. In the late 15th century the manor was refurbished and modified; It is believed that Mathew Cradock was responsible for the construction. His only child, Margaret, was heiress of the manor. Sir Richard Herbert married Margaret. He was from Ewyas, Hereford. In around 1500 alternations were made to the Hall range. It had a four-centred, local green sandstone ogee arch, pointed and chamfered arch tower, parapet corbelling of the roofs, and an \"impressive perpendicular chimneypiece\".\n\nGeorge Herbert of Swansea inherited Candleston from Margaret and Sir Richard Herbert. Mathew Herbert, George's son then held Candleston. Brothers, grandsons of Sir George Herbert, had the manor next. First, Sir William Herbert had the manor in 1598, then Sir John Herbert inherited the manor after his brother's death in 1609. Sir John died in 1617 and Mary, his daughter and heiress, married Sir William Doddington.\n\nRobert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke of Warwick married Doddington's granddaughter. His brother inherited the property upon his death in 1676. Francis Greville, great-grandson of the brother, was Earl of Warwick and 8th Baron Brook. The manor was held by the Grevilles, who visited only occasionally, made only minor modifications, and sold it to the Franklen family in the 18th century. Between 1806 and 1808, Sir John Nicholl resided at the manor while his manor was built. Candleston Castle was sold by Richard Franklen to Nicholl in 1830, when it was said to have included a drawing room, dining room, breakfast rooms, four bedrooms and a coach house. It was evacuated in the 19th century, after having operated as a farm house.\n\nIn the early 19th century modifications included construction of a stable, the castle was crenellated for ornamental purposes and a defensive tower was built. The stepped base of a Calvary cross, of unreported date, with the fallen cross itself lying alongside, was found near the windmill uncovered by sand in 1823.\n\nIn the 21st century, the castle is an \"ivy covered ruin\". Wildfowl, butterflies, moths, autumn gentian, violets and orchids are seen in the area. The area around the castle is woodland and farm land. The nearby Merthyr Mawr dunes are among northwestern Europe's \"highest and most voluminous\" sand dunes, and it is the \"second highest mobile sand dune system in Europe.\" The dunes west of Candleston Castle are more than above sea level and are now fairly stabilised.\n\n"}

Metu was the capital of the former Illubabor Province from 1978 until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.\n\nMetu has been an important market of the coffee trade, with several foreigners residing in the town as early as the 1930s to buy the crops from local farmers. At this early date, the town was connected by telephone to Gore and Addis Ababa. The town's source of electricity is the nearby Sor Hydroelectric Station. The city also has a high school and hospital.\n\nMetu is known for its local waterfalls, the best known being the Sor Falls and their surrounding forest with its wildlife.\n\nOn 9 July 1927, the Greek nationals T.

During the 1960s, experimental tea plantations were started around Gore in the 1960s, and a number of them thrived. The Gummaro plantation near Gore, with 800 hectares, is the largest tea plantation in Ethiopia.\n\nThe town is served by Gore Airport.\n\nGore was founded in the nineteenth century, growing up around \"Ras\" Tessema Nadew's palace. The Russian explorer Alexander Bulatovich stopped here 21 November 1896, expecting to meet \"Ras\" Tessema, who was away campaigning against the Mocha; \"Ras\" Tessema had not returned when Bulatovich left on 31 December. With the growing prosperity of the port town of Gambela, and the growth of the Baro River route to Sudan, Gore likewise prospered, holding two market days a week. Richard Pankhurst describes the pre-World War I community as having five foreign trading concerns -- \"two Greek, one Syrian, one British and one German\"—engaged in the export of coffee, wax, and to a lesser extent animal hides, and the import of cotton cloth, salt, and other manufactured goods. Civet cat oil was also a significant export at the time, Pankhurst noting that \"Ras\" Tessema exported 42 kilos in 1910.\n\nOn 9 July 1927, the Greek nationals T. Zewos and A. Donalis were awarded a contract to link the town and Gore by road with Gambela, a distance of 180 kilometers. However, the road from Jimma to Gore was not yet built by 1935. A trip to Addis Ababa took 20–22 days for pack mules and 14–15 days for riding mules. The mail transport from Gore to the capital departed every Monday at 17.00 while the government telephone line was used also as telegraph connection.\n\nLater Ras Imru Haile Selassie attempted to use Gore as his base to resist the forces of the occupying Italian forces, but hostility from the local Welega Oromo forced him to move from the town late in October, 1936. On 26 November 1936, the Italian 1st Eritrean Brigade occupied the town.\n\nAfter World War II, Gore served as the capital of Illubabor province, until 1978 when Metu became the capital.\n\nBased on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Gore has an estimated total population of 12,708 of whom 6,125 were males and 6,583 were females.

Routes 10, 51, 53, and 54 are either partially or fully funded by Bernalillo County, since these routes largely serve the county's unincorporated areas.\n\nIn addition to its fixed route services, ABQ RIDE also operates a paratransit service called SunVan (known as Mini Ride from 2003–2006) that runs curb-to-curb service.\n\nABQ RIDE operates 21 regular fixed routes, 15 commuter routes, 2 Bus Rapid Transit, and 1 Rapid Ride routes.\n\nRoutes:\n\nThe fare for ABQ RIDE's paratransit service is $2 One-Way, with 10 paratransit fares for $18.\n\nAs of August 13, 2007, all bus routes are now free for University of New Mexico students, faculty, and staff via a sticker on their ID. In October 2007, free ridership was extended to Central New Mexico Community College students as well. In August 2013, UNM Hospital Employees also gained access to the ABQ RIDE sticker program. ABQ RIDE started offering stickers to veterans in the VA health care system on April 21, 2014.\n\nAll buses feature TwinVision LED destination signs. The front destination signs on the New Flyer buses are able to display route numbers in different colors (as the Rapid Ride buses do for the three Rapid Ride routes, the Red Line, Blue Line, and Green Line). All other signs, including the front destination signs on all 300 and 400 series buses, display in orange only. The 300 series buses formerly featured flip-dot destination signs, however, they were retrofitted with the orange TwinVision LED signs in 2004 alongside the automated voice annunciator system. ABQ RIDE did not order the color LED destination signs for the 600 series buses, citing ongoing reliability issues, opting instead to go with orange LED signs.\n\nAll buses are also all equipped with a Digital Recorders automated voice annunciator system, which announces the major intersections (or on the Rapid Ride buses, the stops). The system was first introduced in 2001 on the 400 series buses. The 300 series buses were retrofitted with the system in 2004 (alongside the TwinVision LED destination signs), and all deliveries since then has had the system factory-installed.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, the Federal Transit Administration approved a $3 million grant request from ABQ RIDE to provide money for bus replacement. On February 7, 2014, ABQ RIDE placed an order for 21 New Flyer Xcelisor XN40 CNG Buses, with deliveries starting in the middle of March. 17 of these buses will replace 17 of the 300 series buses, while the remaining 4 have been used to replace the last of the 400 series buses. 300 Series now operate the routes the 400 Series once did.\n\nIn January 2015, bus 617 and bus 747 were involved in separate accidents, resulting in the complete write-off of 747. 617 was repaired at the Yale Transit Yard, and returned to active service in early 2016. Nobody was seriously harmed in either accident, and both accidents were caused by other vehicles failing to stop at a red light.\n\nThe 600-series buses purchased in 2015 (622-641) all have open WiFi networks available for public use. In addition, they have a screen installed behind the driver that displays the current security camera feed from the camera looking down the aisle from the front of the bus.\n\nSource: ABQ Bus Riders\n\nIn addition, the fleet comprises numerous smaller vehicles like the SunVan paratransit vans, and formerly, the Old Town trolley. CNG buses (300- and 600-series buses) and the 900-series buses operate out of the Yale Transit Department on 601 Yale Blvd. SE, while the 700-series buses, Rapid Ride buses (6400-series, 6600-series, and 6900-series), and the paratransit fleet operate out of the Daytona Transit Facility on Daytona Rd near Unser Blvd. and I-40. Daytona operates seven days a week except on city-observed holidays. Yale operates on weekdays only. On May 1, 2015, the 900-series buses were moved temporarily to Daytona due to renovations at Yale; however, they went back to operating out of the Yale facility beginning October 19, 2015. The Yale Transit Department is now equipped with unleaded fuel to fuel shuttle cars.\n\nIn November 2011, ABQ RIDE announced plans for true bus rapid transit service along Central Avenue. The service differs from the Rapid Ride based on the fact that it would be considered a true BRT service based on adding more aspects of BRT service such as a dedicated travel lane or queue jumps, platforms level with the bus floor, and off-board ticketing so that passengers can load at any door.\n\nOn March 24, 2014, ABQ RIDE demonstrated a New Flyer XN60, which was built for RTC in Las Vegas, NV, and was en route for delivery. This type of bus is one of the designs being explored for BRT service, and is the longer 60 foot version of the current XN40 buses being delivered to ABQ RIDE.\n\nOn May 15, 2014, ABQ RIDE introduced a new logo and paint scheme for the organization.\n\nIn October 2014, The City unveiled conceptual designs for construction of Albuquerque Rapid Transit, a true BRT system including dedicated lanes, traffic signal priority, level boarding, and off-bus fare payment. Public input from meetings will allow engineering of the BRT system and redesign of the roads it will travel on.\n\nBRT service started in November 2019.\n\nIn October 2014, ABQ Ride also revealed plans for a transit-oriented development (TOD) on the site of the Uptown Transit Center. The land for the transit center was originally purchased with a grant from the FTA with the intent of someday building a TOD on the site. The plans call for a parking garage above the island where buses stop and will continue to stop, a building with retail on the ground floor and several levels of living units above that, and the possibility of a multi-generational center above the parking garage. These plans were created with the help of a public meeting earlier in 2014. ABQ Ride intends, with FTA approval, to enter into a partnership with a private developer for the actual construction and operation of the building.\n\n\n"}

It is located south of Gondar on the north shore of Lake Tana, in the Semien Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region. Gorgora has a latitude and longitude of .\n\nGorgora refers to a small peninsula jutting into Lake Tana as well as to a small village hosting a harbor. The peninsula was important in the past as the site of an important Jesuit residence: \"Old\" Gorgora was located 5  km northeast, inland from Maryam Gimb, which was called [New] Gorgora, and 5  km west of Debre Sina and its churches (usually not considered a town in its own right). Other notable landmarks include the monastery of Mandaba, located at the headlands of Gorgora peninsula. R.E. Cheesman visited Mandaba in 1932 and described the monastery as being enclosed by a high wall and no woman is allowed inside its gate. There are 150 residents, monks, the monastery is governed by an Abbot who has the power of putting refractory monks in chains, and is all powerful in his own monastery. Cheesman was told that if a man fleeing from justice rings the monastery bell and is given sanctuary, he is safe from even the highest person in the land.\n\nFerries sail from the port to Bahir Dar via Kunzela and Dek Island.\n\nGorgora served as one of the early capitals of Ethiopia during the reigns of Emperor Susenyos I and his son Fasilides before Fasilides founded Gondar. It was selected as a capital as it started with the letter \"gʷa\" (Ge'ez: ጐ), as dictated by a prophecy of the time (the same prophecy led to the rise of Gondar). Gorgora is the Ethiopic bastardization of the Greek name \"Γρηγόριος\" (Gregorios). The city is named after the 4th-century Saint & Church Father Gregory the Illuminator, who is a prominent figure in Ethiopian Orthodox Theology.\n\nRuins of the structures the Jesuits built can still be seen, although most of the buildings fell following an earthquake in the 1950s. Their construction is credited to the missionary Pedro Paez, who also succeeded in converting Emperor Susenyos to Catholicism. The town is known for the Debre Sina church (built in 1608), its many monasteries, the palace of the Emperor Susenyos located nearby, and the Portuguese cathedral that was abandoned after Emperor Fasilides expelled the Jesuits.\n\nGorgora formed part of the defenses of the Italian last stand, under General Guglielmo Nasi, around Gondar. In October 1941, the Italians had one battalion at Gorgora; within a month the garrison was 1500 strong. In 1960 the public health service set up a center in this town, one of the first four in the countryside of Ethiopia. Gorgora was selected due to its proximity to the Public Health College in Gondar.\n\nBased on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Gorgora has an estimated total population of 4783, of whom 2283 are men and 2500 are women. The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 2,768 of whom 1,201 were men and 1,567 were women.\n\n"}

The administrative center of the Semien Mi'irabawi Zone of the Tigray region, this town has a latitude and longitude of with an altitude of 1953 meters above sea level. It was part of Tahtay Koraro woreda.\n\nAn early mention of Shire is in one of the three surviving charters of Emperor Dawit I of Ethiopia (r. 1382-1412).\n\nAs part of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Italian units under General Pietro Badoglio advanced out of Axum on 29 February 1936 to attack the Ethiopian army under \"Ras\" Imru Haile Selassie deployed around Shire in an action known as the Battle of Shire. Despite determined Ethiopian resistance, by 3 March the Italians had resumed their advance and shortly afterwards crossed the Tekezé River.\n\nAfter the restoration of the monarchy in 1941, Shire served as the capital of the Shire sub-region until the administrative reorganization of the nation following the adoption of the 1995 Ethiopian Constitution.\n\nShire once again became a battlefield during the Ethiopian Civil War. The first clash of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF) with government forces occurred 5 August 1975, after Mehari Tekle (\"Mussie\"), a member of the TPLF leadership, was arrested in Addi Daero by government militiamen and taken to prison in Shire. Before he could be transported to a more secure facility in Mek'ele or Addis Ababa, a squad of eleven men burst into the prison, wounding one policeman and scattering the rest, freeing their comrade and 60 other prisoners, and spiriting him away to safety.\n\nDuring the latter part of the war, following the massive Ethiopian army defeat at the Battle of Afabet in March 1988, the TPLF launched a series of offensives, in which they destroyed government forces stationed at Rama, Adwa, Seleh Leha, and Shire. Only about 200 soldiers of the 17th Army Division were able to evacuate Shire and fall back to Gondar. This led to the raising of the Third Revolutionary Army, composed of the 603rd, 604th and 605th core armies. Between 19 June and 3 July 1988 the 604th was able to regain control over 12 districts, and entered Shire with no significant resistance from TPLF forces. However, due to unrest amongst the government soldiers at Addi Hageray, which permitted the TPLF to attack and occupy that town, the 604th was unable to advance again until 28 December. This led to the Second Battle of Shire, which ended on 19 February 1989 as a victory for the TPLF. Although Shire had been the headquarters of the Third Revolutionary Army at the beginning of the battle, at the end the remaining units were retreating towards Enda Aba Guna. The third edition of \"Lonely Planet\" guide to Ethiopia notes that \"war relics\" could still be seen near Shire.\n\nShire has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification \"Aw\") with average rainfall reaching 905 mm.\n\nBased on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town has a total population of 47,284, of whom 21,867 are men and 25,417 women. The majority of the inhabitants said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 85.11% reporting that as their religion, while 14.67% of the population were Muslim.\n\nAccording to the 1994 national census the town had a population of 25,269 of whom 11,360 were men and 13,909 women. In the mid 1980s, the population of the town was below 15, 000.\n\nThe Ethiopian Roads Authority had two roads built to connect Shire to neighboring towns. In June 2009, the authority released a report on their status. The road connecting Shire with Addi Goshu, 156 kilometers in length, was 52% complete, and would be completed by November 2010. The road that would connect to Addi Abun, 92 kilometers in length, would be completed in two years. construction was underway on a road segment 71 kilometers long connecting Shire west to Dedebit, and which will continue on to Adi Remets then terminate at Dejena Densha. The town hosts an airport, Shire Airport (IATA code SHC).\n"}
{"id": "2168191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168191", "title": "Pelican (band)", "text": "Pelican (band)\n\nPelican is a post-metal quartet from Chicago, Illinois. Established in 2001, the band is known for their atmospheric and almost entirely instrumental style. They have released six studio albums and six EPs.\n\nThe band is known for dense combinations of different melodies and extended track lengths. It may be classified as stoner rock, doom metal, or post-rock. Larry Herweg, Trevor de Brauw, and Laurent Schroeder-Lebec are also three members of the band Tusk.\n\nPelican previously signed to Hydra Head Records but is currently signed with Southern Lord Records roster. Pelican toured with Wolves in the Throne Room to support their first EP for Southern Lord, \"Ephemeral\", released on June 6, 2009. \"What We All Come to Need\" was released on October 27, 2009. Greg Anderson and Aaron Turner both appeared on the album. In celebration of the new album, the \"Pelican Burger\" was served at Kuma's Corner for one night.\n\nIn 2012 Pelican announced a new EP, \"Ataraxia/Taraxis\". In April 2012, they began a European tour, playing in England, Italy, Germany, Finland, the Dunk Festival in Belgium and the Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands. The support bands for this tour included Bo Ningen and Tacoma Narrows Bridge Disaster in the UK, and Tombs in continental Europe.\n\nIn June 2012, the band announced an amicable split with guitarist and founding member Laurent Schroeder-Lebec. Schroeder-Lebec had not been touring with the band for the prior two years, with Dallas Thomas of The Swan King performing live in his stead, but not participating in the writing process. On October 15, 2013, Pelican released its fifth studio album and first without Schroeder-Lebec, \"Forever Becoming\".\n\nPelican announced three new upcoming releases in February 2019. The first of which was a remixing/remastering of \"Forever Becoming\". While Pelican was satisfied with the original recordings, Chris Common mixed the tracks in a makeshift studio with \"less-than-ideal circumstances\" that \"varnished the incredible tones generated during tracking\". Southern Lord described the deluxe reissue as bringing \"a new level of low-end depth, atmospheric clarity, and tight, punchy heaviness to the album\". Pelican also announced new album was coming in 2019, and slated a new single from that album \"Midnight and Mescaline\"/\"Darkness on the Stairs\" for release on Record Store Day. Months later in April 2019, Pelican released the track \"Midnight and Mescaline\" for online streaming and formally announced their sixth studio album would titled \"Nighttime Stories\" and would be released on June 7, 2019 through Southern Lord.\n\nRegarding the band's genre, de Brauw said,\n\"I think people use genres and tags to serve a purpose – it gives people a frame of reference to understand music by – but I don’t think any artist feels comfortable being tagged as anything. I have an affinity for metal, but I don’t think of Pelican as a metal band. So when people call us ‘instrumetal’, or post-metal, or metalcore or whatever, I can see why they say that, but it's not something that I feel a close connection with. I feel we’re part of a community with some bands – Mono are good friends of ours, but I don't feel that we’re that similar musically. Their music is more similar to classical music, whereas I feel ours has more in common with punk and hardcore. I feel like we’re part of a trajectory of Midwest bands that kind of blend aggression with a pop sensibility, so while it's easy to classify us with instrumental bands, we’re not instrumental by design. We just didn't know how to put vocals in our music and for it to sound right. When you start a band, you don't have it in mind to be an instrumental band – these things are afterthoughts when your music's out there.\"\n\nSpeaking on the plethora of labels used to describe Pelican's genre, bassist Bryan Herweg states that \"it's flattering, really\", and that \"I take that as nobody being able to classify what we're doing. I really don't want to be fixed in one genre.\"\n\nAs for the instrumental nature of the band, Herweg states that \"I think there are limitations that come with having a vocalist. If we had some big burly man in front screaming, we'd be classified as metal. If we had some scrawny guy we'd be emo. As it is, no one can pin us down.\"\n\nTouring has evolved the band's style from \"drawn-out... slow-building\" to \"more direct and faster, and straight to the point\" material to provide more energy on stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the largest settlement in Ejerie woreda.\n\nAddis Alem is known for the Basilica Church of St Maryam. Its adjacent museum burned to the ground in 1997; however a new one has since opened.\n\nAddis Alem was founded in 1900 by Menelik II as a new capital city; Empress Taytu Betul picked the name. Although at one point he had 20,000 members of the Welega Oromo busy in constructing buildings in the new city, by 1903 he decided to keep the capital at Addis Ababa. However, it was used by the Emperor as his summer palace during the following years. The first paved road in Ethiopia was constructed between Addis Alem and the capital, the work beginning in 1903, and reported in quite usable condition the next year.\n\nAround 1930, most of the wood for the buildings and furniture in Addis Ababa was sawn from the forests near Addis Alem. During the Italian occupation, a factory for the production of slaked lime was established during the Italian time, and in its first year of production it turned out 30,000 hundredweights of the material. On 2 December 1936 the \"Arbegnoch\", led by Admiqe Besha, attacked the Italian garrison. The Italians lost 78 men, and 2,007 rifles, cannons and hand grenades.

{"id": "2168206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168206", "title": "Adigrat", "text": "Adigrat\n\nAdigrat (, \"ʿaddigrat\", also called ʿAddi Grat) is a city and separate woreda in the Tigray Regional State of Ethiopia. It is located in the Misraqawi Zone at longitude and latitude , with an elevation of above sea level and below a high ridge to the west. Adigrat is the last important Ethiopian city south of the border with Eritrea, and is considered to be a strategically important gateway to Eritrea and the Red Sea. Adigrat was part of Ganta Afeshum woreda before a separate woreda was created for the city. Currently, Adigrat serves as the capital of the Eastern Tigray zone.\n\nAdigrat is one of the most important cities of Tigray, which evolved from earlier political centers and camps of regional governors. Antalo, Aläqot and Adigrat were a few of them. The decline of Antalo was followed by the rise of Adigrat as another prominent, yet short-lived, capital of Tigray. It used to serve as the capital of Agame. \n\nTradition attributes the origin of the name Adigrat, which means \"the country of farmland\", to the then popular Tigrayan chief Akhadom. Adigrat seems to have been under cultivation for a long time. It has a settlement history dating back at least to the 14th century.\n\nAdigrat became the center of the Tigrayan chief, \"dejazmach\" Kafle Wahid, the viceroy of atse Fasilides during the first half of the 17th century.\n\nAdigrat emerged as the political capital of Tigray when \"dejazmach\" Sabagadis Woldu of Agame assumed the governorship of the region in the period 1822-30. Sabagadis set up some palaces, churches and markets. This increasingly attracted both natives and foreigners to establish permanent residences and a few shops in the town. Adigrat was an important market-center for salt, which was mined in the Afar districts of Areho and Berale in eastern Tigray. However, it declined after the death of its patron, Sabagadis, in 1830. It was repeatedly attacked, sacked and plundered by the lowlanders and political rivals of Sabagadis. Samuel Gobat had joined countless Ethiopians in fleeing there for safety in the days immediately after Sabagadis' death. \n\nWhen the missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf passed through Adigrat in April 1842, \"almost the whole is in ruins\", and observed that a nearby village, Kersaber, was \"much larger than Adigrat.\" In the late 1860s the town had a rural appearance and much of it is still under cultivation today.\n\nDuring the First Italian-Abyssinian War, the Italians occupied Adigrat on 25 March 1895, and used it as a base to support their advance south to Mek'ele. General Antonio Baldissera refortified the settlement after the Italian defeat at the Battle of Adowa, but Emperor Menelik II insisted on its surrender at the beginning of the peace talks that concluded the war; Baldissera was ordered to evacuate Adigrat, which he did 18 May 1896. Augustus B. Wylde a few years later described Adigrat as having a Saturday market of medium size.\n\nLazarists introduced perhaps the first modern school of northern Ethiopia in Adigrat at the turn of the 20th century. However, like most Ethiopian towns, Adigrat increased its commercial and administrative importance during the period of the Italian occupation. The Italians introduced the first elements of modern infrastructure, including stronger fortresses, restaurants, residential houses, a health center, schools, roads, piped water, an electric generator, etc.\n\nThe Italians again occupied Adigrat at the beginning of the Second Italian-Abyssinian War 7 October 1935. The Italians were met there on the 11th by Ras Haile Selassie Gugsa, who had been courted by the Italians to ignite a widespread defection of the Tigrayan aristocracy; instead, he had been soundly defeated a few days before by Dejazmach Haile Kebbede of Wag, and presented himself to the invaders with only 1200 followers. Anthony Mockler notes that despite the fact the young Ras shook Ethiopian morale, \"this was the first and last open defection to the Italians of an important noble and his men.\"\n\nIn 1938, there were shops and hotel-restaurants (“Bologna”, “Piemontese”, “Centrale”). There was also a post, telephone and telegraph office, a health post and a Catholic Apostolic Prefecture. \n\nAdigrat was captured by rebels in the Woyane rebellion 25 September 1943, forcing the Ethiopian government administrators to flee to neighboring Eritrea. By 1958 the city was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as a First Class Township.\n\nAdigrat's dependence on merchandising and trade meant that the Derg's imposition of commercial and transport restrictions were strongly felt and resented. Under the Derg business licenses became progressively more difficult to get, and traders' trucks were requisitioned for the transport of war-related materials to army bases in Eritrea. Permits of travel were required; convoys were introduced by 1976; and the road links to Asmara were virtually broken, largely by the ELF, by the late 1970s.\n\nDuring the first years of the Ethiopian Civil War, the fledgling Tigrayan People's Liberation Front drew support from these groups. Derg forces took Adigrat during their Operation Adwa in summer 1988. The same day that the Third Revolutionary Army was crushed at Battle of Shire, 19 February 1989, government troops and officials evacuated Adigrat. According to Africa Watch they caused widespread destruction in the town before they left.

He is most famous for his metallic sculptures and colorful sheep paintings.\n\nKadishman was born in the British Mandate Palestine in 1932. His father, who was a pioneer, died when Kadishman was 15 years old. The young Menashe left school to help his mother with housework and to earn money.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1950, Kadishman studied with the Israeli sculptor Moshe Sternschuss at the Avni Institute of Art and Design in Tel Aviv, and in 1954 with the Israeli sculptor Rudi Lehmann in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1959, he moved to London, where he attended Saint Martin's School of Art and the Slade School of Art. During 1959 and 1960 he also studied with Anthony Caro and Reg Butler. He remained here until 1972; he had his first one-man show there in 1965 at the Grosvenor Gallery.\n\nHis sculptures of the 1960s were Minimalist in style, and so designed as to appear to defy gravity. This was achieved either through careful balance and construction, as in \"Suspense\" (1966), or by using glass and metal so that the metal appeared unsupported, as in \"Segments\" (1968). The glass allowed the environment to be part of the work.\nKadishman lived and created in his house in the city center of Tel Aviv.\nKadishman was divorced, has 2 children.

This experience with nature, sheep and shepherding had a significant impact on his later artistic work and career. The first major appearance of sheep in his work was in the 1978 Venice Biennale, where Kadishman presented a flock of colored live sheep as living art. In 1995, he began painting portraits of sheep by the hundreds, and even thousands, each one different from the next. These instantly-recognizable sheep portraits soon became his artistic \"trademark\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2168227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168227", "title": "Debre Tabor", "text": "Debre Tabor\n\nDebre Tabor (,  \"Mount Tabor\") is a town and a woreda in north-central Ethiopia. Located in the Debub Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region of Ethiopia, about 100 kilometers southeast of Gondar and 50 kilometers east of Lake Tana, this historic town has a latitude and longitude of with an elevation of above sea level. The presence of at least 48 springs in the area contributed to the development of Debre Tabor.\n\nDebre Tabor is served by an airport (ICAO code HADT, IATA DBT).\n\nAuthorities differ over the facts of its founding. Mordechai Abir states that it was founded by Ras Ali I; however, Richard Pankhurst gives a detailed account of its foundation by Ras Gugsa, and includes the tradition that the location was selected with supernatural help. In either case, Debre Tabor was the seat of the Regents of the Emperor in the 18th and 19th centuries, from which periods several churches and the ruins of two palaces survive. Debre Tabor was the capital of Ethiopia under two Emperors: Tewodros II, before he moved the capital to Magdala; and Yohannes IV. As a result, in the 19th century the population of this town varied depending on whether the emperor was in residence. If he was present, the population could reach 30,000 as it did under Emperor Yohannes; if he was not, it would be around 5,000 people.\n\nDebre Tabor was sacked by an army from the province of Lasta in 1835. The Battle of Debre Tabor was fought nearby on February 6, 1842; although Dejazmach Wube Haile Maryam and his allies defeated the armies of Ras Ali II and sacked Debre Tabor once again, they were surprised while celebrating their victory by Birru Aligas, an ally of Ras Ali, who captured Wube and his son and extracted concessions from them in return for their release.\n\nRas Ali built four churches in Debre Tabor: Iyasus on the mountain to the southeast, Ennatitu Maryam and Legitu Maryam to the east, and Tegur Mikael to the north. A second palace was built for his mother, the Empress Menen Liben Amede, which was not as large as Ras Ali's.\nAlthough he burnt the town in May 1853, following Ras Ali's defeat, Emperor Tewodros used Debre Tabor as his capital until his situation weakened so badly that he was forced to abandon the town (October 1867) for his stronghold on Maqdala. The Emperor Yohannes IV often resided at Debre Tabor, and during his reign Heruy Giyorgis church was built. Here the Emperor met with General Gordon in October 1878, who was representing the Egyptian government, about Ethiopian demands for access to the Red Sea. It was also in Debre Tabor that Tekle Haymanot was crowned Negus of Gojjam in January 1881.\n\nWhen the Bank of Ethiopia was created in 1931 it opened a branch office with two employees at Debre Tabor. During the Second Italian-Abyssinian War, Debre Tabor was occupied by unit which advanced from Bahir Dar on 28 April. During the occupation, a telegraph office was opened in the town and postal service restored. The Italians also constructed a road from Gondar via Debre Tabor to Dessie. The first mosque in Debre Tabor was constructed and eucalyptus planting extended. Despite these improvements, as early as August 1937, there were almost simultaneous but apparently uncoordinated attacks by \"arbegnoch\" on garrisons near Debre Tabor and near Bahir Dar. After several months of attacks, the British convinced Colonel Angelini to surrender the town 6 July 1941, allowing the British to advance towards the organized Italian resistance around Gondar under the command of Guglielmo Nasi, who by this point was the acting Viceroy and Governor-General of Italian East Africa.\n\nIn 1958, Debre Tabor was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township.\n\nNear the beginning of Derg rule, Debre Tabor was seized by a group of local landlords and their followers in opposition to the government September 1975, killing the provincial governor and expelling both a Chinese road-building team and missionaries of the Seventh Day Adventist Church who ran a local hospital. Government control was reestablished within a month.\n\nIn late December 1989, Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) forces captured Debre Tabor, claiming that they killed or wounded more than 8,000 government troops. Around 20 January 1990, the Ethiopian News Agency announced that government forces had recaptured Debre Tabor. A few days later, the clandestine radio of the TPLF claimed a major victory in battles near Debre Tabor on 22–24 January 1990, claiming their soldiers had killed 3,914 government troops and captured 270. Although the town was retaken by government troops a few days later, the TPLF, announced the recapture of the town after a three-day battle in late February. About a year later, on 23 February 1990, the town was used as the jumping-off point for Operation Tewodros.\n\nBased on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town has a total population of 55,596, of whom 27,644 are men and 27,952 women. The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 96.72% reporting that as their religion, while 2.54% of the population said they were Muslim.\n\nThe 1994 national census reported a total population for Debre Tabor of 22,455 in 4,700 households, of whom 10,564 were men and 11,891 were women. The largest ethnic group reported in this town was the Amhara (98.93%); Amharic was spoken as a first language by 99.26%, while 92.62% of the population practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity and 6.15% of the population said they were Muslim.\n\n\n"}

During the years of the JSDF, Kunihiko Tosa met the founder of Genseiryū, Seiken Shukumine, for the first time.\n\n\"There was a sports day at the JSDF. In the competition of high jumping, a man jumped over the bar after taking just two steps back. He landed with in a cat's stance (Neko-ashi-dachi). The person was Seiken Shukumine, who at that time was an officer of the storage management section. A few days later, Kunihiko Tosa met Shukumine again and asked him if he was doing karate. Shukumine said nothing but took Kunihiko Tosa to the back of a storage. Suddenly Seiken Shukumine jumped over Kunihiko Tosa's head just like in that high jump. When Kunihiko Tosa looked back at Seiken Shukumine, he faced a finger strike (Nuki-te) to his throat. Kunihiko Tosa could not help but ask Seiken Shukumine on the spot to instruct him in karate. At that time Seiken Shukumine had not yet named his style Genseiryū. There was not a well organized dojo, but only a small group of people who recognized Seiken Shukumine's incredibly talented techniques. Seiken Shukumine and his companions created Genseiryū's original katas in those days. Needless to say, that Kunihiko Tosa was one of the participating members.\"\n\nSeiken Shukumine, the founder of Genseiryū accepted his first student, Kunihiko Tosa, in 1952. Seiken Shukumine and Kunihiko Tosa among others worked together on establishing the Genseiryū organization. Seiken Shukumine switched to Taidō in 1962, but Kunihiko Tosa continued promoting Genseiryū in Japan as well as internationally.\n\nThe Ōizumi Gakuen, Tokyo \"honbu dojo\" (\"supreme headquarters\") was established in 1959 by Kunihiko Tosa. This dojo was named Butokukai and became the \"honbu dojo\" of the Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation that same year. In 1965 an additional dojo was built in Asaka, Saitama Prefecture. Although the Ōizumi Gakuen, Tokyo dojo still exists today, the supreme headquarters was moved from Ōizumi Gakuen, Tokyo to the new Asaka building in 1965.\n\nThe Genseiryū organisation founded by Seiken Shukumine in 1953 was dissolved in late 1961 or early 1962. This is also partly the reason for Kunihiko Tosa to establish the new headquarters of the GKIF in Asaka (Japan) in 1965. This building is the official headquarters and honbu dojo of the GKIF.\n\nThe Genseiryū Karate-do International Federation has about 150 dojos worldwide, but most of them are in Japan. Kunihiko Tosa is the \"Saiko-Shihan\" (grand master) and president of the organization. Kunihiko Tosa was awarded the 9th dan by the GKIF, while the Japan Karatedo Federation (JKF) recognizes the 8th dan.\n\nKunihiko Tosa wrote and published a book on Genseiryū in 1984. The book is titled: 玄制流空手道教範２ - 型編 (\"Genseiryū Karatedō Kyōhan 2 - kata hen\" or: \"\"The teachings of Genseiryu Karatedo 2 - kata collection\"\") and contains a preface by Seiken Shukumine (1925–2001). The book contains pictures and detailed descriptions of the nine official advanced kata of Genseiryū (a total of 23 kata are taught and practiced in Genseiryū as part of the official curriculum). The versions of the kata in this book are the versions officially recognized in Japan by the Japan Karate-do Federation (JKF).\n\nThe author, Kunihiko Tosa, initially planned a 2 volume series, one containing the basics of Genseiryū and the other containing the advanced kata. Due to the costs of issuing two volumes at that time (early 1980s), Kunihiko Tosa decided to first issue the sequel considering, that a book containing the advanced kata was much more needed than a book about the basics. Kunihiko Tosa is planning to publish the first volume at a later date, thus completing the Genseiryū volumes 1 and 2. \n\nThe GKIF include the following in its curriculum divided into two sections, one for juniors and one for seniors.\n\n\n\n\nAs officially defined by the Japan Karate-do Federation.\n\n\n\n"}

He is generally acknowledged as the father of the modern round brilliant diamond cut. Many of his family have gone on to become noted diamond cutters, including his cousin Lazare Kaplan and his great nephew Gabi Tolkowsky.\n\nTolkowsky, as part of his PhD topic at the University of London, systematically studied the grinding of diamonds.\nAround the same time, in his book \"Diamond Design\", he published the specifications of what would later be called the \"American Standard\" (also known as the \"American Ideal Cut\", \"Tolkowsky cut\", and \"Tolkowsky Brilliant\"), which is the diamond-cutting benchmark in North America. It was derived from mathematical calculations that considered both brilliance and fire of the stone. Marcel Tolkowsky found that if a diamond was cut too deep or shallow then light would escape out the sides or bottom of the diamond resulting in a loss of brilliance (white light reflected up through the top of a diamond), fire (colored light reflected from within a diamond), and sparkle (combination of fire and brilliance). The original model was intended to be a set of general guidelines; several aspects of a diamond's cut had not been accounted for or explored.

At the end of the meeting, on November 14, the parties signed an agreement promising, among other things, to follow Seiken Shukumine's book \"Shin Karatedō Kyōhan\" (published 1964), which the WGKF considers the original Genseiryū, as a training guideline. \"Ten-i\", \"Chi-i\" and \"Jin-i\" are considered by the WGKF to be among the basic and most essential \"kata\" of the organization's curriculum. Some instructors from within the WGKF have chosen to also practice and teach other kata such as \"Heian\" (basic kata from \"Shotokan\"), \"kata\" that are not included in the official curriculum. None of these instructors have rejected any of the kata mentioned in the book \"Shin Karatedō Kyōhan\".\n\nCurrently, the President of the WGKF is Yasunori Kanai, Vice-President is Rodolfo S.

It was recorded between April and June 1999 and was produced by Mark Trombino. It was released on 3 October 1999 by record label Murmur.\n\nIt peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and, by December of the following year, it received a Platinum certification from ARIA.\n\n\"Of Someday Shambles\" was recorded from April to June 1999 by Jebediah with American producer Mark Trombino (Knapsack, Jimmy Eat World, Blink 182). The group's line-up was Chris Daymond on lead guitar, Kevin Mitchell on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Vanessa Thornton on bass guitar and Kevin's older brother Brett Mitchell on drums. On the choice of Trombino as producer, Kevin explained:\n\nWe chose him because he'd done the last two records by Knapsack... they're kinda like a discordant punk band, this weird indie rock pop punk crossover. We mainly made the decision because of the direction we could see the songs going. They were still pop songs like \"Odway\" but they were getting more complicated, not as straightforward; they had a bit more depth to them.\nWorking with Trombino had Brett Mitchell \"record with a metronomic click track\" for his drum parts. Daymond recalled that Brett would \"keep going, but there would be longer pauses between him being asked, 'Are you OK?' and him replying, 'I'm all right' ... The pauses would get longer and longer. Then eventually he'd go, 'I need a cigarette'.\"\n\n\"Animal\" was the lead single from the album and was released on 9 August 1999. It reached number 16 on the ARIA Singles Charts, which was promoted by an Australian tour supported by New Zealand indie rock band Garageland.\n\n\"Of Someday Shambles\" was released on 3 October 1999 by Murmur. Initial pressings of the album contained a bonus DVD, filmed by the band during the recording of the album. The DVD features footage of the band in the studio and in public, in addition to music videos from the first album, including \"Harpoon\" and \"Teflon\". The album peaked at number two on the ARIA Albums Chart and remained in the top 50 for 25 weeks. By December 2000 \"Of Someday Shambles\" had received a platinum certificate from ARIA.\n\nThe second single released was \"Feet Touch the Ground\", which was released on 22 November 1999 and peaked at number 75. The next single, \"Please Leave\", was released on 13 March 2000 in two versions: a brown version and a blue version. It peaked at number 53.\n\nThe fourth and final single, \"Star Machine\", was released in 2000 as a promotional single only. It received airplay on community radio stations and national youth radio's Triple J. The song was used on the soundtrack for season one of the Australian TV drama series \"McLeod's Daughters\".\n\nAustralian musicologist Ian McFarlane described \"Of Someday Shambles\" as \"brimming with youthful exuberance and feisty, melodic, guitar-based fuzzy punk-pop perfectly suited to the post-grunge alternative generation. It was a more adventurous, varied and assured album in some ways, without the band members getting too clever and too far removed from what they do best.\" Greg Lawrence at WHAMMO.com.au noted that it \"delivers on the promise of \"Slightly Odway\", ... [this] effort has the four-piece sporting tonnes more light and shade than their first effort and stretching out in the studio.\"\n\nKen Taylor of AllMusic rated the album at two-and-a-half stars out of five and felt it \"makes noisy emo-pop that, for the most part, indulges the sweet tooth of younger kids still aiming to assert some type of aggression. The songwriting, though not the strongest suit for these four youngsters, comes across as sophomoric but isn't entirely bad, as some of the changes take unpredictable twists and turns. The biggest problem that Jebediah faces is that they occasionally fall prey to certain Green Dayisms. Structurally, they strike a chord and a drum, and the three beats in between are given to the guitarist to illustrate his rather tepid chops. The nasally vocals are also damagingly pedestrian and taste rather stale at this point.\" PopMatters Jeremy Hart noticed the influence of Jimmy Eat World on this album, but felt that on \"Of Someday Shambles\" Jebediah \"brings the worlds of indie-rock and pop closer together than most bands can ever hope to\".\n\n\n\n"}

Dinko was born in 1558 as the son of Žimun (Simone Slatarich) Zlatarić and Frana, daughter of a very wealthy nobleman by the name of Dominik Kladurobović. Dinko's brother Mihajlo Zlatarić served as a major-lieutenant in the forces of Juraj IV Zrinski, while history didn't remember his other brothers Cvijeto and Nikola. His only sister Kata died by 1597. Dominiko had one son the name Žimun Zlatarić.\n\nLearning Italian and Latin from a young age and writing his first poems when still a child, Dinko showed his talent early. Because of that, his father sent him to Padua, where after completing the famous Gymnasium, he entered the local University, where he learned rhetoric, philosophy and civil law. In 1579 he funded the printing of Italian poems of his close friend Caesar Simonetti and dedicated them to Cvijeta Zuzorić. He also studied Greek in Padua.\n\nBecause of his knowledge and seriousness, the students elected him rector on 13 August 1579. For keeping the peace and order at the university, he was rewarded by the Republic of Venice with the title of \"Golden Knight\" (\"eliues auratis\"). In 1580, a plaque was put at the university in his honor and he returned to his home Dubrovnik.\n\nIn 1587 he married Mara, the daughter of Pero Gomović. He shared his time between writing and running his estates in Cavtat and Konavle. He had friends among poets from Italy and Dubrovnik and admired the famous Renaissance beauty Cvijeta Zuzorić. Zlatarić wrote in Croatian and Italian – love poems, epitaphs and poetic meditations – but his greatest achievements are his translations.\n\nHe held an important place in the historiography of Croatian literature, as he explicitly declared the language of his works under its Croatian name, \"\"iz veće tuđijeh jezika u hrvacki izložene\"\".\n\nHe translated Tasso's manuscript of the pastoral drama \"Aminta\" in Padua in 1580. Later, dissatisfied with his translation, Zlatarić changed it, reworked it and adapted it to a Croatian setting, so it became \"Ljubmir\". Then he published \"Electra, a Tragedy, and Ljubmir, a Pastoral History\" (a collection of his translations) and \"Love and Death of Pyramus and Thisbe, Translated into Croatian from Several Foreign Languages\", in Venice in 1597. Zlatarić dedicated \"Electra\" to Juraj Zrinski, \"Ljubmir\" to Miho Matufić, and \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" to Cvijeta Zuzorić.\n\nHis translations from Greek, Italian and Latin included 26 original \"pjesni u smrt od razlicijeh\" (poems about various people's deaths). After his death, his son Miho Zlatarić collected and published 137 lyrical poems of his father under the title \"Pjesni razlike\" (Various Poems). Most of them are love poems.\n\nZlatarić was one of the most prolific epitaph writers of the Croatian Renaissance. The most effective one is his short epitaph to Dinko Ranjina (\"Nadgrobje Dinku Ranjini\"), followed by the epitaph to Bartolomeo Pescionio, the husband of Cvijeta Zuzorić. Zlatarić's poems are included in the \"Zadar Collection\".\n\nHe wrote under the influence of the first generation of Croatian Petrarchists and Italian Petrarchist schools. His strong links with the local Petrarchist tradition are shown by his rich style. His varied expression, mastery of verse and sound, put Zlatarić among the best Croatian lyrical poets of his time.\n\nZlatarić is also renowned as the best translator of the Croatian Renaissance. He translated Tasso's \"Aminta\" literally, with the necessary changes forced by a different meter. The second version, \"Ljubmir\", is even more refined, literary and pure, with a richer language. His translation of Sophocles' \"Electra\" reveals not only Zlatarić's education, taste and versifying ability, but also his poetic gift. \"Love of Pyramus and Thisbe\" is closer to a prose translation. In general, Zlatarić's translations can be considered independent poetic achievements, widening the range of Croatian Renaissance literature.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168278", "title": "The Stone Tape", "text": "The Stone Tape\n\nThe Stone Tape is a television play directed by Peter Sasdy and starring Michael Bryant, Jane Asher, Michael Bates and Iain Cuthbertson. It was broadcast on BBC Two as a Christmas ghost story in 1972. Combining aspects of science fiction and horror, the story concerns a team of scientists who move into their new research facility, a renovated Victorian mansion that has a reputation for being haunted. The team investigate the phenomena, trying to determine if the stones of the building are acting as a recording medium for past events (the \"stone tape\" of the play's title). However, their investigations serve only to unleash a darker, more malevolent force.\n\n\"The Stone Tape\" was written by Nigel Kneale, best known as the writer of \"Quatermass\". Its juxtaposition of science and superstition is a frequent theme in Kneale's work; in particular, his 1952 radio play \"You Must Listen\", about a haunted telephone line, is a notable antecedent of \"The Stone Tape\". The play was also inspired by a visit Kneale had paid to the BBC's research and development department, which was then located in an old Victorian house in Kingswood, Surrey.\n\nCritically acclaimed at time of broadcast, it remains well regarded to this day as one of Nigel Kneale's best and most terrifying plays. Since its broadcast, the hypothesis of residual haunting – that ghosts are recordings of past events made by the natural environment – has come to be known as the \"Stone Tape Theory\".\n\nPeter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the selfish and petulant head of a research team for Ryan Electrics. His team is developing a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment of one of the rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.\n\nCurious, the researchers explore the room and hear the sounds of a woman running followed by a gut-wrenching scream. Jill Greeley (Jane Asher), an emotionally sensitive computer programmer, has a vision of a woman running up the steps in the room and falling, apparently to her death.\n\nInquiring of old records, Collinson finds records of a young maid who had died in the room in 1890 and that an unsuccessful exorcism had previously been performed on the property. Brock and Jill briefly meet with a local Vicar, who is also an archivist, but he fails to turn up records of the exorcism.\n\nBrock hypothesises that it is not a ghost, but that somehow the stone in the room has preserved an image of the girl's death—this \"stone tape\" may be the new recording medium they have been seeking. Their scientific devices fail to detect any evidence of the phenomena the team experience, and different team members experience different phenomena: most are able to hear sounds, Jill can also see images, but another member of the team experiences no sensory input. Jill hypothesises that the \"tape\" does not produce actual sound or light, but instead interfaces with the human nervous system during to create the sensory impression of sound and vision, and some individuals are more sensitive to this than others. She surmises that the recordings are imprinted in moments of extreme emotion, like a kind of telepathy.\n\nExcited by the possibilities presented by a recording medium which uses a person's own senses as the means of recording and playback, Brock and his team move into the room. They bombard it with their technology, hoping to find the secret of the \"stone tape\" and have it play on demand. Brock is certain that the secret is connected to the walls, but he fails to develop a predictable method of triggering. Under mounting pressure to succeed, Brock uses every available instrumentation, only to be told, by Jill, that the presence she had felt earlier was now gone, apparently meaning that the \"tape\" has been erased. Brock's failures are compounded when his superiors signal their lost confidence in him, requiring him to share Taskerlands with a rival research team working on a new washing machine.\n\nEmbittered, Brock no longer wants anything to do with the stone tape. He disregards Jill's insistence that there is still more to learn about the room and her mounting concerns that it is dangerous to stop their research. As Brock directs the team to resume its past projects, the Vicar reappears claiming to have found records of the unsuccessful exorcism, not in 1892, but much earlier, in 1760, before the house even stood.\n\nRealizing that the phenomenon occurring in the room is far older than the house, Jill theorizes that the stone tape can be recorded over again and again, like magnetic recording tape; the maid's death was simply the most recent and clearest recording. Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.\n\nReturning to the room one last time, Jill's senses are besieged by a powerful, malevolent presence from the much-degraded older recording. Like the maid before her, she dies while frantically trying to escape it.\n\nDuring an inquest, Brock tries to save face by denouncing Jill as having been mentally unstable. Afterwards he orders that all of Jill's research be destroyed without reviewing it. The \"haunted\" room has been declared of historical importance by a preservation society, prohibiting development, destruction, or commercial use. He makes a final visit to the room and discovers to his horror that the stone tape has made a new, crystal-clear recording—that of Jill screaming his name as she dies.\n\nNigel Kneale was a Manx television playwright who had first come to prominence in the 1950s thanks to his three \"Quatermass\" serials and his controversial adaptation of George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", all of which were produced by the BBC. Going freelance in the nineteen-sixties, Kneale had produced scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films. In the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC, writing such plays as \"The Year of the Sex Olympics\", \"Wine of India\" and, for the anthology series \"Out of the Unknown\", \"The Chopper\".\n\nIn the middle of 1972, Christopher Morahan, who was Head of Drama at BBC2 and who had directed Kneale's 1963 play \"The Road\" and the 1965 remake of Kneale's adaptation of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", approached Kneale asking him to write a play to be broadcast over the Christmas period. Accepting the commission, Kneale quickly decided that, in keeping with Christmas tradition, he would write a ghost story, but with a difference – ancient spirits would come into collision with modern science. The concept of mixing the supernatural with high technology had long been a feature of Kneale's work – most notably, his 1952 radio play \"You Must Listen\", which concerned a telecommunications engineer who discovers that a telephone line has somehow preserved the final conversation between a woman and her lover before her suicide, was an important antecedent of \"The Stone Tape\". The science and supernatural theme is also present in Kneale's \"Quatermass and the Pit\" which, in addition, shares similar elements with \"The Stone Tape\" such as an abandoned house with a reputation for hauntings; the collection of documentary evidence of the haunting (also a trademark of M. R. James, a writer much admired by Kneale) and the sensitivity of certain characters to the supernatural. In addition, the relationship between the scientists and the local villagers echoes that seen in \"Quatermass II\".\n\nFor the research facility at \"Taskerlands\", Kneale was influenced by a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, the researchers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal of the members of the Ryan research team in \"The Stone Tape\". Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, \"The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, which is a very clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research ... They were nice chaps – and so we got some very nice chaps for the TV version\".\n\nKneale delivered his script, initially titled \"Breakthrough\" and later renamed \"The Stone Tape\", in September 1972. Because of its subject matter, it was felt that the play would be best handled as an instalment of \"Dead of Night\", a supernatural anthology series produced by Innes Lloyd. In the end, \"The Stone Tape\" was broadcast as a standalone programme but production was handled by the \"Dead of Night\" team under Lloyd. Selected as director was Hungarian Peter Sasdy whose credits included adaptations of \"The Caves of Steel\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" for the BBC and \"Taste the Blood of Dracula\" and \"Hands of the Ripper\" for Hammer. Cast as Peter Brock was Michael Bryant, who had starred in the BBC's 1970 adaptation of Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Roads to Freedom\" and had a reputation for playing \"bad boy\" roles. Jane Asher, playing Jill Greeley, had, as a child, appeared in Hammer's \"The Quatermass Xperiment\", the film adaptation of Kneale's BBC serial \"The Quatermass Experiment\". Iain Cuthberston, playing Roy Collinson, was well known for his role in \"Budgie\" and would go to become the star of \"Sutherland's Law\" while Michael Bates, cast as Eddie Holmes, had appeared in \"Patton\" and would later become known for his roles in the sitcoms \"Last of the Summer Wine\" and \"It Ain't Half Hot Mum\".\n\nRecording of \"The Stone Tape\" began on 15 November 1972 with the exterior scenes of the house, \"Taskerlands\". These were shot at Horsley Towers, East Horsley in Surrey. This was once owned by Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and sponsor of computer pioneer Charles Babbage. Production then moved to BBC Television Centre between 20 November 1972 and 22 November 1972. Not all scenes were recorded in time and a remount was required on 4 December 1972. Michael Bates was not available on this day and his lines had to be redistributed among the other cast members. Incidental music and sound effects were provided by Desmond Briscoe of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and these proved significant in setting the mood of the play – sections were later used in a BBC educational programme on the effectiveness of incidental music.\n\n\"The Stone Tape\" aired on 25 December 1972 on BBC2 to an audience of 2.6 million. The \"Evening Standard\" praised the play, describing it as \"one of the best plays of the genre ever written. Its virtues aren't just the main spine of the story, but the way the characters shift, as in real life, the bitter comic conflict between pure and impure science\". Viewers were similarly impressed: a panel questioned for an audience report praised \"The Stone Tape\" as \"thoroughly entertaining\" and \"both gripping and spine-chilling\".\n\n\"The Stone Tape\" was one of the last plays Nigel Kneale wrote for the BBC. He had become increasingly disenchanted with the organisation, mainly as a result of the rejection of several scripts such as \"Cracks\", a proposed \"Play for Today\", and a fourth \"Quatermass\" serial. Moving to Independent Television, he wrote and created series such as \"Beasts\" and \"Kinvig\" and succeeded in getting his rejected \"Quatermass\" scripts produced in 1979. He died in 2006.\n\nThe script of \"The Stone Tape\" was published, along with the scripts of \"The Road\" and \"The Year of the Sex Olympics\" in 1976 by Ferret Fantasy under the title \"The Year of the Sex Olympics and Other TV Plays\".\n\nOne of the first to promulgate the hypothesis of residual haunting, that ghosts may be recordings of past events made by the physical environment, was T. C. Lethbridge in books such as \"Ghost and Ghoul\", written in 1961. Since the broadcast of the play, this hypothesis has come to be known as the \"Stone Tape Theory\" by parapsychological researchers.\n\n\"The Stone Tape\" was a significant influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film \"Prince of Darkness\" in which a group of scientists investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered in the basement of a church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym \"Martin Quatermass\", and included a reference to \"Kneale University\". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in \"The Observer\", \"For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it. It sounds pretty bad. With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [a reference to \"\" for which Kneale wrote an early draft] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust\". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film \"Poltergeist\". In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial \"Ghost Zone\", a character refers explicitly to the \"Stone Tape theory\" as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is \"replaying\" scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.\n\n\"The Stone Tape\" remains well-regarded to this day. Roger Fulton, writing in \"The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction\", calls it \"arguably the most creepy drama ever seen on television\". The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as \"one of the masterpieces of genre television, an authentic alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics\". Writer and member of \"The League of Gentlemen\", Jeremy Dyson feels that \"The Stone Tape\" \"strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it just has this impact on you, rather like being in the room itself. Extraordinary piece of work\". Writer Grant Morrison recalled \"The Stone Tape\" as \"really creepy and very memorable. Just brilliant images. That scared the hell out of me!\". Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that \"\"The Stone Tape\" stands as perhaps his (\"Nigel Kneale's)\" finest single work in the genre\". Lez Cooke, in his book \"British Television Drama: A History\", has praised the play as \"one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of \"Play for Today\"\".\n\nA BBC radio play was produced in 2015 written by Matthew Graham and Peter Strickland. It features a cameo from Jane Asher.\n\nA DVD was released by the British Film Institute in 2001 with a commentary by Nigel Kneale and critic Kim Newman, sleeve notes by Kim Newman and the script of the play as well as the script of \"The Road\". This edition is now out of print, but in 2013 the DVD was re-released with new cover art by 101 Films, which also included the commentary by Kneale and Newman. It was also included in a two-disc edition with the BBC's \"Ghostwatch\" programme from 1992.\n\nThe soundtrack from this film, composed by Desmond Briscoe at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, was released on 13 April 2019 on 10\" green vinyl for Record Store Day 2019. It was reissued as a bonus disc in the Record Store Day exclusive 6-CD box set \"Four Albums 1968 - 1978\" 20 June 2020.\n\n\n\n"}

He was succeeded by Díaz Arosemena's Second Vice President, Roberto Chiari. He belonged to the Liberal Party.\n\nChanis earned his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1917, practicing medicine in both Panama and Scotland. Chanis published a paper in the American Urological Association's \"Journal of Urology\" in 1942 titled \"Some Aspects of Hermaphroditism: Report of a Case of Female Pseudohermaphroditism\" in 1942. He also served as General Council of Panama in Liverpool and London, and as Treasury Minister.\n\nNational police forces, under the command of Remón, were called in ostensibly to maintain the monitor the elections, though in reality their presence was intended to sway the voting to Diaz Arosemena, the preferred candidate of the United States. Chanis ran as the First Vice-Presidential candidate with Díaz Arosemena. Though Arias appeared to have 1,500 more votes than Díaz Arosemena following the May 9 election, the Panamanian national elections jury declared Díaz Arosemena the winner on August 6 by a margin of approximately 2,400 votes. Arias fled to Costa Rica following the decision. Chanis assumed the duties of First Vice=President on October 1, 1948.\n\nChanis was sworn in as acting chief executive on July 28, 1949, when then president Domingo Diaz Arosemena took a six-month leave for health reasons. Chanis became president following Arosemena's death on August 23, 1949.\n\nChanis's presidency came to an end on November 20, 1949. Panamanian Police Chief José Remón led a coup d'état in response to Chanis's refusal to overturn a Panama Supreme Court decision invalidating a contract between an abattoir that was \"part of Remón's business empire\" and several powerful Panamanian families. Chanis had asked for Remón's resignation previously, and, when Remón refused, tendered his own resignation in protest. Whether this resignation was voluntary or forced by Remón is unclear, although it would appear that foreign diplomatic pressure, not wanting to see full out bloodshed, encouraged the resignation. Chanis was replaced by Second Vice-President, and Remón's cousin, Roberto Chiari.\n\nShortly after his resignation, Chanis had a change of heart and withdrew his resignation, claiming it came under duress, and delivered a \"blistering attack\" on Remón before the General Assembly. The Assembly, at the behest of former president Harmodio Arias, supported Chanis, and prepared for confrontation with the national police. Chiari forced his hand, however, and demanded the Panama Supreme Court rule on who, he or Chanis, was the constitutional president; the Supreme Court came back in favor of Chanis by a 4-1 vote. This misstep, and his desire to avoid violence, led Remón to replace him with his former \"bitter political enemy\" Arnulfo Arias, with the approval of the Panama Congress. To legitimize the presidency, the national election jury, who had in 1948 ruled against Arias, \" found pro-Arias votes it had been unable to find in weeks after the 1948 balloting\".\n"}

After Gorilla Biscuits broke up, he formed the short-lived Moondog. In October 2006, the band's self-titled EP was officially released for the first time ever on Anthology Recordings. It was previously available only as a bootleg 7\" record. Moondog would transition into the more metal-oriented post-hardcore band Quicksand. He also collaborated with his former Gorilla Biscuits bandmates in the melodic hardcore band CIV, writing much of their first LP and one song on their follow-up LP despite not actually playing on the record. He went on to start World's Fastest Car, a relatively short-lived project. The band recorded a demo and an EP, neither of which have been officially released. The EP was supposed to be released by Revelation Records, but that never came to fruition due to their breakup. Later, he helped create the melodic indie rock-styled band Rival Schools. After Rival Schools' dissolution, he went on to form Walter and the Motorcycles, who recorded but never released a self-titled LP and played a few shows but quickly broke up. Walking Concert, his next project, was heavily influenced by classic British acts such as Elvis Costello, The Kinks, Syd Barrett, David Bowie and The Smiths. In addition to a new solo acoustic LP scheduled for release in 2008, Schreifels reformed Rival Schools in June 2008 with plans to release a new album. In October 2009, he appeared on \"Memoria : A Tribute to the Alternative 90s\" (Yr Letter Records) with \"When You Sleep\", a My Bloody Valentine cover. In 2014, Schreifels joined a blues rock band that would come to be known as Dead Heavens.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, Rival Schools released the deluxe single for \"Shot After Shot\" on iTunes from the forthcoming record \"Pedals\", which was released in March 2011.\n\nAs a producer, he has worked with such hardcore-related bands as Hot Water Music, Sinch , The First Step and Title Fight. He produced the EP \"Deer Strutter\", the first from the UK band Cars As Weapons, and a full length titled \"Days Above Ground\" from Australian post-hardcore band, Paper Arms. He is also part owner of the record label Some Records. He produced hardcore/pop punk act Title Fight's first full length titled Shed.\n\nOn May 4, 2010, Schreifels released his first solo album, \"An Open Letter to the Scene\" on Big Scary Monsters Recording Company (UK), Academy Fight Song (U.S.), Dine Alone Records (Canada) and Arctic Rodeo (Europe). In support of the album release, Schreifels announced a 12-date UK tour. The album features 10 tracks on CD and 11 on vinyl, including covers of songs by Agnostic Front, CIV, and My Bloody Valentine (vinyl version only). The CIV song he covered, \"Don't Gotta Prove It\", was written by Schreifels.\n\nIn an interview with \"Alter The Press!\", Schreifels confirmed his follow-up solo record was 85% complete and would be titled \"Jesus Is My Favorite Beatle\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her father, Rutger Smith, was a retired sea captain who had settled down as a small merchant, and she often accompanied him on the voyages he made along the coast. She thus came in frequent contact with the seafaring folk, fishermen, and smugglers who were to populate her later stories. At the age of twenty, she married a local physician, Axel Flygare, and went with him to live in the province of Småland. She was widowed in 1833, returned to her old home, and decided to devote herself to literature.\n\nShe moved to Stockholm some years later, and in 1841 she married a lawyer, publicist and poet of that city, Johan Gabriel Carlén (1814–1875). Her house became a meeting place for Stockholm men of letters, and for the next twelve years she produced one or two novels annually. The premature death of her son Edvard Flygare (1829–1853), who had already published three books, showing great promise, was followed by six years of silence, after which she resumed her writing until 1884.\n\nShe founded charitable endowments in aid of students and of teachers, and of fishermen and their widows. She is best known by the hyphenated name \"Flygare-Carlén\". Her daughter, Rosa Carlén (1836–1883), was also a popular novelist.\n\nHer first novel, \"Valdemar Klein\", was published in 1838. In that and several later novels, such as \"Rosen på Tistelön\" (1842; Eng. trans. \"The Rose of Tistelön\", 1842), \"Pål Värning\", \"Enslingen på Johannisskäret\" (1846; Eng. trans. \"The Hermit\", 4 vols., 1853), \"Jungfrutornet\", and \"Ett köpmanshus i skärgården\" (1859; \"The Merchant's House on the Cliffs\"), she wrote about life in the archipelago and the sea, while the stories of novels such as \"Fosterbröderna\", \"Fideikommisset\", \"Ett år\", \"En nyckfull kvinna\", \"Kamrer Lassman\", and \"Vindskuporna\" take place in the middle or upper classes.\n\nHer novels were collected into 31 volumes (Stockholm, 1869–1875). In 1878, she published an autobiography, \"Minnen af svenskt författarlif 1840–1860\" (\"Reminiscences of Swedish Literary Life\"). She was translated into Danish, Norwegian, German, Russian, French, English, Italian, Dutch, Hungarian and Czech, and was the most widely read Swedish novelist of her time.\n\nIn 2007, Valancourt Books released a new scholarly English edition of \"The Magic Goblet\" (\"Kyrkoinvigningen i Hammarby\", 1841), edited by Amy H. Sturgis.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also Emeritus Professor of Urban Education, University of California, Los Angeles, and Emeritus Professor of Educational Leadership, Miami University of Ohio. He is also Honorary Director of Center for Critical Studies in Education in Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China.\n\nHe is the author and editor of over forty-five books and hundreds of scholarly articles and chapters. His writings have been translated into over 20 languages.\n\nMcLaren is married to Yan Wang from Northeast China. They currently live in Orange, California. He has a son and daughter from previous marriages.\n\nMcLaren is known as one of the leading architects of critical pedagogy and for his scholarly writings on critical literacy, the sociology of education, cultural studies, critical ethnography, and Marxist theory. Paulo Freire, a founding figure of critical pedagogy, stated: \"Peter McLaren is one among the many outstanding 'intellectual relatives' I 'discovered' and by whom I in turn was 'discovered.' I read Peter McLaren long before I ever came to know him personally (...) Once I finished reading the first texts by McLaren that were made available to me, I was almost certain that we belonged to an identical 'intellectual family.'\"\n\nDuring a keynote address at Chapman University on October 25, 2014, Dr. Nita Freire, eminent educational scholar and widow of Paulo Freire remarked: \"It is ... a huge thrill for me to see Peter McLaren and Donaldo Macedo, who ever since through discussions and dialogue became old friends of work and friendship, partners of ideological and theoretical ideas of Paulo. They along with Henry Giroux formulated the critical pedagogy as we know of today.\"\n\nHe has developed a reputation for his uncompromising political analysis influenced by a Marxist humanist philosophy and a unique literary style of expression. He has worked with Abahlali baseMjondolo, in South Africa; the landless workers’ movement, Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra – MST, in Brasil, the Zapatistas in Mexico, and members of the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela.; and with the left education workers union in Turkey where in the midst of a demonstration he was teargassed and hurled to the ground by a police's riot shield.\n\nProfessor McLaren is a faculty member at the Institute of Critical Pedagogy at The Global Center for Advanced Studies and he lectures worldwide on the politics of education. In Finland he gave an Opening Lecture in Paulo Freire Center–Finland in November 20, 2007. La Escuela Normal Superior de Neiva in Colombia has named one of its buildings after Peter McLaren.\n\nPeter McLaren was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1948 and raised in Toronto and also, for a 4-year period, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He is the only child of Frances Teresa Bernadette McLaren and Lawrence Omand McLaren, from Canada. McLaren's early family life was working-class until his father, a WWII war veteran with the Royal Canadian Engineers, returned from battle in Europe and began work as a television salesman, eventually rising to the rank of General Manager of Phillips Electronics, Eastern Canada. McLaren's mother was a homemaker before working as telephone operator.\n\nMcLaren used to read voraciously in literature, philosophy, poetry, social theory, and literary and art criticism, was making creative 35 mm. movies at 16, and dreamt of being an artist or film director. McLaren's father had one sister, Bonnie, who married Terry Goddard, a WWII Royal Airforce pilot who is credited with helping to sink the German battleship, Bismark. McLaren's mother had four sisters and two brothers. McLaren compensated for being an only child by spending time with his many cousins, and with engaging in creative writing. McLaren's first writing award was during middle school where he won top writing honors by producing a science fiction story.\n\nAt 19, McLaren hitchhiked throughout the US, met with Black Panthers in Oakland, lived in San Francisco and Los Angeles where he participated in anti-Vietnam war protests, met with Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg and began writing poetry and short stories. His first commercial publication was about his great Aunt, Irma Wright, who won the competition of the world's fastest typist in 1928. \n\nHe earned a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature at University of Waterloo in 1973 (specializing in Elizabethan drama), attended Toronto Teachers College and went on to earn a Bachelor of Education at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Education, a Masters of Education at Brock University’s College of Education, and a Ph.D. at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto (where he worked with the late Richard Courtney, a leading international authority in children's drama).\n\nMcLaren taught elementary and middle school from 1974-1979. Most of that time was spent teaching in Canada's largest public housing complex located in Toronto's Jane-Finch Corridor. \"Cries from the Corridor\", McLaren's book about his teaching experiences, made the Canadian bestseller list and was one of top ten bestselling books in Canada in 1980 (\"Maclean's Magazine\", \"The Toronto Star\"), initiating a country-wide debate on inner-city schools. (Later McLaren would harshly criticize this book and go on to transform it into the highly acclaimed pedagogical text, \"Life in Schools\").\n\nAfter earning his doctorate in 1983, he served as Special Lecturer in Education at Brock University where, as a one-year sabbatical replacement, he specialized in inner city education and language arts. After the Dean did not follow through on his promised extension of McLaren's contract, McLaren decided to pursue an academic appointment in the United States. However, he remains on good terms with faculty at Brock University, with whom he remains in a relationship of solidarity and friendship.\n\nMcLaren left Canada in 1985 to teach at Miami University's School of Education and Allied Professions where he spent eight years working with colleague Henry Giroux during a time when the epistemology known as critical pedagogy was gaining traction in North American schools of education. McLaren also served as Director of the Center for Education and Cultural Studies, and held the title of Renowned Scholar-in-Residence at Miami University before being recruited by the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California, Los Angeles, in 1993.\n\nIn 2013, McLaren was appointed Distinguished Fellow in Critical Studies at Chapman University Orange, California.\n\nIn 2019, The Griffith Journal of Law and Human Dignity, affiliated with the top-ranked law school in Australia, published an extensive interview with McLaren. And the same year the OC Weekly featured commentary on two articles featured by McLaren on the fight against fascism in the United States, and McLaren published a graphic novel of his life with an artist Miles Wilson.\n\nFirst Phase, 1980-1993\n\nThe theoretical orientations of the first ten years of McLaren's research and writing can be traced to his early undergraduate work in Elizabethan drama, theater arts, and from there to his graduate studies in symbolic anthropology, critical ethnography and social semiotics. As a young man, McLaren had always admired the life and work of William Morris author, poet, artist and craftsman, printer and calligrapher, formidable socialist and activist, businessman and private individual. At the time that he enrolled in doctoral studies at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (Institut d'Etudes Pedagogiques de L'Ontario), Victor Turner, the world-renowned symbolic anthropologist, was conducting path breaking transdisciplinary work at the University of Virginia, bringing dramaturgical theory and anthropology into close collaboration, particularly as this applied to the study of ritual. McLaren soon became a scholar of Turner's work. After auditing a course at the Toronto Semiotics Institute taught by philosopher Michel Foucault, and another by Umberto Eco, McLaren began to develop a transdisciplinary approach to the study of ritual. He found a rich transdisciplinary milieu in which to conduct his studies at Massey College, University of Toronto. Modeled after Balliol College, Oxford University, England, Massey College facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration among high achieving graduate students from various departments on campus. Looking back at his educational experiences at Massey, it is not surprising that the work of performance theorists, political economists, anthropologists, dramaturgical theorists, literary critics, and symbolic interactionists informed the theoretical basis of his first major scholarly publication, Schooling as a Ritual Performance Towards a Political Economy of Educational Symbols and Gestures (first edition, Routledge, 1986; revised editions, 1994, 1997) which was based on his Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nMcLaren's early work from 1984-1994 spanned diverse intellectual and empirical terrains. He remained steadfast in his interest in the contemporary themes of the Frankfurt School: social psychology in the context of a lack of revolutionary social protest in Europe and the United States; a critique of positivism and science; developing a critical theory of art and representation; an interrogation of the mass media and mass culture; investigating the production of desire and identity; and the globalization of capitalism and forms of integration in neoliberal societies. In other words, when viewed against the major themes of the Frankfurt School, there was a fundamental coherence to his work as a whole.\n\nFurther, each of McLaren's scholarly projects attempted to explore the construction of identity in school contexts within a neo-liberal society. This meant engaging in numerous critical projects: exploring the debilitating effects of logical positivism in the social sciences and the assault on critical theory and critical ethnography; exploring the increasing colonization of the lifeworld by the mass media and developing a critical pedagogy of media literacy and a political aesthetics of pedagogical experience; analyzing the decline of critical rationality in postmodern societies and the development of critical literacies; advancing in specific pedagogical terms the struggle to redefine the meaning of liberation and empowerment in an age of despair and cynicism; investigating the politics of post-liberal societies with specific reference to the practices of cultural racism and sexism, and developing an analysis of the production, distribution, consumption, and exchange of cultural objects in schools and larger social sites with an emphasis on the social construction of subjectivity.\n\nIn this early period, McLaren's research emphasized the development of a critical emancipatory consciousness, self-conscious reason, and the centrality of nonidentity thinking towards a non essentialist view of revolutionary consciousness grounded in a theory of intersubjective understanding through language. Practically, his work attempted to create an oppositional cultural politics that enabled teachers and students to analyze how the dominant and negotiated meanings that inform classroom texts were produced and to uncover the ideological and political meanings that circulated within them. McLaren attempted through critical reading strategies to illuminate the dominant pedagogical codes of teachers as well as the normative codes within classroom cultures of students. His purpose was to create alternative readings as well as new pedagogical practices. In this sense, critical pedagogy, as McLaren was formulating it, attempted to re engage a social world that operates under the assumption of its collective autonomy and so remains resistant to human intervention.\n\nIn his early work, McLaren engaged four main strands in educational theory and studies: critical ethnography, critical pedagogy, curriculum studies and critical multiculturalism.\n\nSecond Phase, 1994–present\n\nMcLaren work during the past several decades is not so much a break from his early work, as an extension of it. A discernible shift occurred in the sense that he now focuses more on a critique of political economy. But his early work also included a critique of capitalism, except during that time McLaren operated from primarilya Weberian understanding of class and was concerned at that time with the politics of consumption and lifestyle/identity. McLaren's new turn saw him focus on the social relations of production and its relation to the production of subjectivity and protagonist agency. Between 1994 up to the present, McLaren's work is less directed at the classroom per se, and more focused on issues such as a critique of political economy, cultural contact and racial identity, anti-racist/multicultural education, the politics of white supremacy, resistance and popular culture; the formation of subjectivity, the coloniality of power and decolonial education; revolutionary critical pedagogy informed by a Marxist humanist analysis and liberation theology.\n\nDuring this time McLaren began spending time in Latin America—working with Chavistas in Venezuela and with labor and union leaders in Mexico and Colombia and becoming more interested in Marxist critique of political economy. McLaren came to believe that postmodern theory could be quite a reactionary approach in so far as it failed to challenge with the verve and sustained effort that is demanded of the times the social relations of capitalist production and reproduction. While McLaren adopted the term, critical postmodernism, or resistance postmodernism, to describe his work up until the late 1990s, he recognized that he needed to engage the work of Marx and Marxist thinkers.\n\nThe more McLaren began engaging in the work of Marx, and meeting social activists driven by Marxist anti-imperialist projects throughout the Americas, he no longer believed that the work on ‘radical democracy’ convincingly demonstrated that it was superior to the Marxist problematic. It appeared to McLaren that, in the main, such work had despairingly capitulated to the inevitability of the rule of capital and the regime of the commodity. That work, along with much of the work in post-colonialist criticism, appeared to McLaren as too detached from historical specificities and basic determinations. McLaren believed that Marxist critique more adequately addressed the differentiated totalities of contemporary society and their historical imbrications in the world system of global capitalism. Rather than employ the term critical pedagogy, McLaren now uses the term that British educator Paula Allman has christened “revolutionary critical pedagogy.” McLaren describes his current work as Marxist humanist, a term developed by Raya Dunayevskaya, who once served as Trotsky's secretary in Mexico and who developed the tradition of Marxist humanism in the US. McLaren's work constitutes counterpoint to the way social justice is used in progressive education by inviting students to examine critically the epistemological and axiological dimensions of democracy in the light of a Marxist critique of political economy and the coloniality of power (a term developed by Anibal Quijano). McLaren's work today comprises poetry, reflections on his activist work in Venezuela, Mexico and other countries, contributions to critical theory and Marxist analysis as applied to current educational policy and reform initiatives.\n\nMcLaren's Critical Pedagogy\n\nMcLaren's work has broken new ground in education. He is considered one of the architects of critical pedagogy, having been influenced early in his career by Paulo Freire and Henry Giroux. He also has been credited with laying the groundwork for performance studies in education with the publication of his book, Schooling as a Ritual Performance. The Peter McLaren Upstander Lecture was recently announced as part of the Annual International Critical Research in Applied Theater Symposium, Auckland, New Zealand. The lecture is to be presented each year by a graduate student in education from the School of Critical Studies in Education at the University of Auckland. Currently McLaren is known as one of the leading exponents of revolutionary critical pedagogy, an approach to everyday life influenced by Marxist humanist philosophy, also known as a “philosophy of praxis.” McLaren's work is controversial for its uncompromising politics of class struggle. McLaren is also a gifted orator and social activist, and his academic writing has been both praised and criticized for its unique blend of poetry and literary tropes and cutting-edge theoretical analysis. At least one documentary is in the planning about McLaren's life.\n\nMcLaren approaches critical pedagogy as a praxiological effort to develop a politics of everyday life in a number of ways. First, it situates its critical analyses within the realms of popular culture. Secondly, it pays close theoretical attention to the ways in which everyday discourses and social practices both constitute and reinforce relations of power as well as serve as sites for struggle, resistance, and transformation. Thirdly, critical pedagogy as developed by McLaren attempts to seize opportunities to make links between new social movements and the networks of power associated with \"school life.\" It does this by attempting to link the micropolitical (everyday lives of teachers and students) with the macropolitical (larger economic, cultural, social, and institutional structures).\n\nCritical pedagogy, as McLaren develops it, seeks to analyze the possibilities for the resistance and transformation of social life, both individual and collective, personal and macropolitical. It engages in such an analysis by attempting to understand how wider relations of power are played out in the agential spaces of classroom and community life but also by attempting to investigate how wider structures of mediation at the level of the economy are able to \"take root\" in the everyday lives of students and teachers who operate at the level of common sense actions. This means constantly reflecting on the cultural construction of the identities of teachers, students, researchers and also connecting such critical reflection to a wider terrain of political action and class struggle. McLaren takes critical pedagogy beyond a discursive politics that sees politics as merely a text to be deconstructed and interpreted. Instead, McLaren approaches cultural politics as a terrain that operationalizes the textuality of political life by linking textuality to materiality. That is, McLaren seeks to make connections between the texts that we read (cultural artifacts) and those that read us (the realm of language and discursive structures in general) in light of current modes and social relations of production and the political consequences that these connections bring about in our pedagogies, curricula, and policies.\n\nBetween 1994–present, McLaren revised and extended some of his earlier insights in Schooling as a Ritual Performance, and Life in Schools, and other works, through an engagement with Marx and leading Marxist philosophers and theorists.\n\nWhile anti-capitalist struggle and Marxist analysis has an indistinct and relatively undigested place in the field of educational theory, there is some movement towards Marx in the social sciences here in North America. Marx is being revisited by social scientists of all disciplinary shapes and sizes – even, and perhaps most especially and urgently today, when capitalism is in a state of severe crisis. While hardly on their way to becoming entrenched and pervasive, Marx's ideas are taking their significance most strikingly from the particular and varied contexts in which his ideas are being engaged. Thank to McLaren's work, Marx's ideas are gaining traction in education.\n\nIn McLaren's post-1994 phase, Marxist theory has provided McLaren with an approach to praxis that is fundamentally necessary to better contextualize changes in the socio-political and economic sphere as it relates to education. Through McLaren's current reengagement with Marx, and the tradition of historical materialism, McLaren supports the work of colleagues whose work is paving the way for new generations of educationalists to encounter Marx. Marx is being reevaluated on numerous fronts today: sociology, political science, philosophy, economics, ethics, history, and the like.\n\nMcLaren is the author, co-author, editor, and co-editor of approximately forty books and monographs. Several hundred of his articles, chapters, interviews, reviews, commentaries, and columns have appeared in dozens of scholarly journals and professional magazines worldwide.\n\nHis most recent books include:\n\nHe is also author of \"Life in Schools: An Introduction to Critical Pedagogy in the Foundations of Education\" (Allyn & Bacon) which is in its fifth edition (2006). \"Life in Schools\" has been named one of the 12 most significant writings worldwide in the field of educational theory, policy and practice] by an international panel of experts assembled by the Moscow School of Social and Economic Sciences; other writers named by the panel include Paulo Freire, Ivan Illich, and Pierre Bourdieu. In 2011, Instituto Peter McLaren was established in Ensenada, Mexico.\n\nProfessor McLaren's work has been the subject of three recent books: \"Teaching Peter McLaren: Paths of Dissent\", edited by Marc Pruyn and Luis M. Huerta-Charles (Peter Lang, 2005) [translated into Spanish as \"De La Pedagogia Critica a la pedagogia de la Revolucion: Ensayos Para Comprender a Peter McLaren\", Mexico City, Siglo Veintiuno Editores], Peter McLaren, \"Education, and the Struggle for Liberation\", edited by Mustafa Eryaman (Hampton Press, 2008), and \"Crisis of Commonwealth: Marcuse, Marx, McLaren\", edited by Charles Reitz (Lexington Books, 2013).\n\nMcLaren has also recently debuted as a poet with his poem \"The Despoiling of the American Mind\" in \"MRZine\". His works have been praised, among others, by Slavoj Žižek and Paula Allman. Žižek comments McLaren's book \"Che Guevara, Paulo Freire and the Pedagogy of Revolution\" as follows: \"\"Che Guevara is usually perceived as a Romantic model whom we should admire, while pursuing our daily business as usual—the most perverse defense against what Che stood for. What McLaren's fascinating book demonstrates is that, on the contrary, Che is a model for our times, a figure we should imitate in our struggle against neoliberal global capitalism.\" Allman notes that the book is \"brilliant blend of passion, commitment, and critical analysis and insight. (...) It is also one of the most important books on critical education, and thus also education and social justice, to have been written in the twentieth century.\"\" \n\nPeter McLaren was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Lapland, Finland in 2004 and by Universidad del Salvador, Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2010 and by the Universidad Nacional de Chilecito in La Rioja, Argentina. He also received the Amigo Honorifica de la Comunidad Universitaria de esta Institucion by La Universidad Pedagogica Nacional, Unidad 141, Guadalajara, Mexico.\n\nIn 2005, a group of scholars and activists in Northern Mexico established La Fundacion McLaren de Pedagogía Critica to develop a knowledge of McLaren's work throughout Mexico and to promote projects in critical pedagogy and popular education. On September 15, 2006 the Catedra Peter McLaren was inaugurated at the Bolivarian University of Venezuela.\n\nPeter McLaren's webpages and CV\n\nPeter McLaren's text\n\nTexts on Peter McLaren\n\nInterviews\n"}

It is built on the same platform as used on the Camry.\n\nAnnounced in April 2000 at the New York International Auto Show and arriving in late 2000 in Japan and January 2001 in North America, the Highlander became one of the first car-based mid-size SUV or mid-size crossovers. The Highlander is the crossover counterpart to the more rugged, truck-based mid-size 4Runner and became Toyota's best-selling SUV before being surpassed by the smaller RAV4 in 2006. In Japan, the Kluger is exclusive to dealership network called \"Toyota NETZ\" as a larger alternative to the RAV4.\n\nUnable to use the Highlander nameplate in Japan and Australia because of a trademarked Hyundai Terracan trim line, Toyota calls the vehicle the Toyota Kluger (pronounced \"Klu-ger\") there. The name is derived from the German word klug, which means smart or clever (\"Kluger\" meaning \"one who is smart\").\n\nThe Highlander (or Kluger in Japan and Australia) shared a platform with its XU30 series Lexus RX/Toyota Harrier cousin. It came in five (2001–2007) and seven-seat (2004–2007) configurations and became a sales success for Toyota in a number of markets across the world. The Highlander came standard with front wheel drive and offered all wheel drive (50:50 front:rear fixed torque split). Unlike Toyota's own 4Runner and other mid-sized competitors such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, or Chevrolet TrailBlazer, the Highlander aimed for on-road comfort with its unibody construction and independent rear suspension. Although it was longer than the 1996–2002 4Runner available at the time it was launched, the Highlander was surpassed in length by the redesigned 4Runner in 2002.\n\nThe Highlander was available in three trim lines in the United States: the base model, the Sport model, and the Limited model. The base and Limited models were present when the Highlander was initially introduced, while the Sport model was introduced in March 2006. In Japan, it is regarded as a luxury vehicle as the Kluger exceeds Japanese Government regulations regulating engine displacement and exterior dimensions.\n\nIn 2004 the wheels on the Limited trim changed from a six-spoke to a five-spoke alloy. The base-model Highlander wheels also changed from steel-rims to the alloy wheels that were on the 2001–2003 model year Highlander Limited and B-Package. The Sport models had a distinctive grille design, differentiating themselves from the non-Sport models. Wheel styling also serves to differentiate the various models—the hybrid sports a unique twin-spoke design.\n\nThe Kluger was introduced to Australia in October 2003. It was available in three guises: CV, CVX, and Grande. A limited edition CV Sport model was also released in 2006. There was no hybrid model available in Australia. The only engine offered was the 3.3-liter \"3MZ-FE\" V6. Typical fuel economy using the Australian standard testing regime is .\n\nEngines:\n\nThe 3.0-liter engine was able to propel the Kluger from 0–60 mph in approximately 8.8 seconds. In 2004 the Kluger was given a new 3.3-liter V6 engine to compete with the more powerful V6 offerings from its competitors, mainly the Nissan Murano and the Honda Pilot. The larger engine made it possible for the Kluger to reach 0 to in 7.8 seconds.\n\nThe Japanese and Australian Kluger was released with a center console integrated with the dashboard, while the North American Highlander initially lacked this integrated center console. The integrated center console was introduced in all US Highlanders and in Canadian Limited Highlanders in 2001, for the 2002 model year, and in all Canadian Highlanders in 2003, for the 2004 model year. However, for these early Highlanders without the integrated center console, a smaller non-integrated stand-alone center console was available as an option, which was installed at the factory or could be installed by the dealer.\n\nIn 2003, for the 2004 model year, in addition to the 3.3-liter engine, V6-powered models were equipped with a new five-speed automatic transmission, replacing the four-speed automatic transmission, while the inline-four models continued to use the old four-speed. This year also saw the introduction of the optional third row seat allowing for two additional passengers. The center console, which was previously exclusive to the top trim level, is now standard across all trims. The unibody was slightly modified behind the second row seats to include a depression in the trunk floor able to accommodate the optional third row seating. On models without third row seating, this depression was turned into a storage compartment (prior to 2004 the spare tire was accessible from inside the vehicle where the third row seating would subsequently be located; beginning in 2004 the spare tire is accessible from underneath the vehicle). Subtle changes to the front grille, front and rear bumpers, headlights and taillights (LED taillights on later hybrid models) round-out the major changes for the 2003 mid-cycle refresh.\n\nIn 2005, for the 2006 model year, Highlanders sold in Canada were offered only in a V6 all-wheel drive configuration. Hybrid models were available with part-time four-wheel drive, which Toyota refers to as 4WD-i whereby the rear wheels are powered by a separate electric motor. This system is intended for use on snow and ice and is prone to overheating the rear electric motor off-road.\n\nAnti-lock brakes, brake assist and electronic brakeforce distribution were standard, Vehicle Stability Control w/traction control optional on 2001–03 models became standard for 2004 models (Hybrids come standard with VDIM). Also standard for 2004 was a tire pressure monitor. Front seat-mounted side torso airbags were optional on 2001–06 models, while front and second row side curtain airbags were optional on 2004–06 models. Side airbags became standard on 2007 models and the curtain airbags gained a rollover sensor that year as well.\n\nIn Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests the Highlander was rated \"Good\" overall in the frontal offset crash test. The IIHS reported the Highlander had one of the lowest driver fatality rates among all vehicles, and amongst SUVs, only the Toyota 4Runner had a lower driver fatality rate. This report looked at 2001–2005 model year vehicles in the US.\n\nInitially, the Kluger was a regular, non-hybrid SUV driven by an internal combustion engine, but later Toyota introduced a hybrid version, the Kluger Hybrid that utilizes the company's Hybrid Synergy Drive technology combined with the company's \"3MZ-FE\" 3.3-liter V6 engine offered in either FWD or AWD trim. The hybrid drivetrain was unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, and was offered to the public in July 2005 as a 2006 model. The power steering pump, water pump and AC compressor were changed from belt-drive to electrically powered versions. A modified alternator was incorporated into the hybrid system.\n\nIn North America, the hybrid version was called the Highlander Hybrid. It was also the first seven-seat hybrid vehicle. With the electric motors providing power including lower speeds overall acceleration is improved particularity at passing speeds. Other additions include Toyota's Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB). The California Air Resources Board gave it a SULEV emission rating. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (revised standards) rated it at City/ Highway for FWD models and / for AWD models. This system is near identical to that of the Lexus RX 400h. All-wheel drive models were rated to tow .\n\nToyota revealed the second generation Highlander and Highlander Hybrid at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show, with American sales beginning in July and hybrids in late September. But the second generation Highlander and Highlander Hybrid are not sold in Japan. The five-seat Highlander for the United States and Canada was dropped as the Venza replaced it.\n\nInitially the sole powertrain for the 2008 Highlander was a 3.5-liter \"2GR-FE\" V6 mated to a five-speed automatic. The four-cylinder model had been discontinued but added again in 2009. While the 3.5-liter engine has 55 more bhp than the previous 3.3-liter V6 and dimensional increases along with increased sound proofing added nearly 500 pounds to the vehicle's curb weight of approximately 4,000 lbs, fuel economy is slightly improved. The EPA estimated fuel economy for front-wheel drive models is at\n\nFor 2009, Toyota again offered a 4-cylinder for 5-passenger front-wheel drive models with the all-new ULEV-II certified 2.7-liter \"1AR-FE\" I4 paired to a six-speed automatic. It generates at 5,800 rpm and of peak torque at 4,100 rpm on regular 87 octane fuel. The four-cylinder delivers an EPA estimated fuel economy of city and highway. This is better than the previous model's four-cylinder with /.\n\nThe same three trim levels were offered (Base, Sport and Limited) until early 2010 when the SE model replaced the Sport model, buyers are still able to choose between front-drive or all-wheel drive on V6 platforms. Also new is an Electric Power Steering (EPS) system. Sport and Limited models get a standard backup camera using a 3.5-inch LCD display. Major options include leather seats, heated seats, a touchscreen DVD based navigation system, a new Smart Key System, an upgraded JBL Synthesis stereo, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with 9-inch screen, and a towing package that increases towing capacity to 5000 pounds.\n\nThe XU40 was initially produced exclusively at the Miyata plant in Miyawaka, Fukuoka, Japan for all global markets beginning in May 2007. Production in China for local sales was started on 25 May 2009 by GAC Toyota in Nansha District, Guangzhou, Guangdong. Toyota had intended on building the Highlander in Blue Springs, Mississippi for the North American market in the 2011 model year. However, the Corolla was built there instead, and the Highlander is being built at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana in Princeton, Indiana, from the 2010 model year onward for a majority of North America, replacing Tundra production. TMMI Highlander production began in October 2009 for gasoline engine models only; hybrids continued to be imported from Japan until the release of the third generation XU50, where all production except for China was consolidated at TMMI.\n\nIn Australia, the new generation Kluger was launched in August 2007. There are three grades available, KX-R, KX-S and Grande. All grades are available with either 2WD or AWD. The base model KX-R is also available with either five or seven seats, whilst the latter grades are seven seaters only. Specifications are mostly similar to the US Highlander, sharing the same 3.5-litre V6 \"2GR-FE\" engine and five-speed automatic transmission. However, there are no plans at present to introduce a hybrid version of the Kluger into the Australian market.\n\nIn 2010, for the 2011 model year, Toyota made some changes to the Highlander and Highlander Hybrid. While the general design remains similar to the 2010 model, the Highlander's front end has been significantly revised, now featuring new headlights, a new black with chrome accent rocker panel, and new front grille. The non-hybrid engines for 2011 remain the same, although now the 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine may be had on the SE trim level, previously only available on the base model. More standard features are now equipped on all trim levels, with the base model receiving front and rear air conditioning, power locks/windows, cruise control, and a multi-function keyless entry control.\n\nPre-facelift styling\nPost-facelift styling\n\nAll models come standard with enhanced Vehicle Stability Control which immediately alters electric powering steering assist w/traction control (hybrids come standard with VDIM), anti-lock brakes, brake assist and electronic brakeforce distribution. Also standard is a tire pressure monitor, a driver's knee airbag, front seat-mounted side torso airbags, side curtain airbags for all three rows which includes a rollover sensor and active front headrests. Hill Start Assist Control (HAC) is also standard which prevents rolling backwards on slopes, and Downhill Assist Control (DAC) is standard on AWD trims.\n\nThe IIHS rates the Highlander \"Good\" overall in their frontal offset crash test, and good in all subcategories except for \"Head/neck,\" which is rated as \"Acceptable.\" And \"Good\" overall in the side impact crash test, with \"Good\" rating in all nine measured categories. The Highlander is also rated \"Good\" in the roof strength test, giving it a \"top safety pick\" rating.\n\nIn Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) testing the Kluger is given a rating but only a rating for pedestrian protection.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of the Highlander/Kluger's Vehicle Stability Control system has been questioned by some motoring journalists. During testing for\" Wheels\" magazine Car of the Year in 2007, the magazine's editor rolled the vehicle during high-speed gravel road testing. Noting that it was the first such event in the magazine's 45-year history, he criticised the vehicle's stability system stating that \"Deficiencies in the Kluger's ESP contributed to the crash\". Six of the seven other judges also stated that they felt \"\"the vehicle's ESP performance was sub-standard\"\", and remarked that the vehicle was \"\"almost dangerous on dirt [roads]\"\". In a written response, Toyota disputed the circumstances of the accident and criticised the testing procedures as \"unscientific\".\n\nThe Kluger Hybrid features Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive which continues to allow an electric only powered mode for short distances and speeds. Weight and cost have been improved over the previous hybrid.\n\nThe expanded size and new features have led to an increase of 500 pounds to its curb weight. All Highlander Hybrids are all-wheel drive, and the EPA has rated the hybrid at for the city and for the highway, same as the previous model. The Highlander's fuel economy, while better than the Lexus RX 400h's, lags behind the compact 4cyl Ford Escape Hybrid, which ceased production in 2012, and the latest RX 450h, but still produces significantly fewer emissions than the non-hybrid version with a CARB SULEV rating.\n\nThe Highlander Hybrid continues to use the same 3.3-liter \"3MZ-FE\" V6 (208 hp) offered in AWD from the prior model, net power is . VDIM and Electronically Controlled Brake remain new features include a driver selectable electric only EV mode (when possible) and another ECON mode which restricts acceleration and minimizes air conditioning during acceleration. The Highlander Hybrid Hybrid uses a 1.9 kWh sealed nickel-metal hydride traction battery.\n\nFor the 2011 model year the Highlander Hybrid received styling changes and was upgraded with the 3.5-liter \"2GR-FXE\" V6 (245 hp), increasing net power by , and a powertrain similar to the RX450h. The vehicle is now rated at for the city, highway and combined cycles.\nThe Highland FCHV was a test vehicle using compressed hydrogen gas, with average fuel economy of (approximate mpg equivalent).\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the 2007 LA Auto Show.\n\nThe Chinese version of the Highlander (ASU40/GSU45) was unveiled in 2009 at the 13th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition.\n\nOn 27 March 2013, Toyota unveiled the third generation XU50 series Highlander at the New York International Auto Show, with plans to have the vehicle reach dealerships in early 2014. Production began on 5 December. This version is longer and wider than the outgoing generation and its design has changed from its boxy look to one that is similar to other mid-size crossover SUVs.\n\nIn addition to the changes, this one will feature seating for eight people with a sliding second-row point of entry that gives it 4.3 inches of added width space, soft-touch materials on the instrument panel, lane-departure warning, pre-collision warning and blind spot monitoring systems. HD Radio and Bluetooth will become a standard on all trims for the US version, which will also come equipped with Toyota's Entune multimedia system along with a 6.1-inch touchscreen display audio system. An eight-inch touchscreen system and Toyota's Entune app suite with 12 JBL speakers will be offered as an optional feature. The three powertrain trims that will be offered include a 2.7-liter, six-speed automatic, front-wheel drive base model, a 3.5-liter, six-speed automatic model in both front- or all-wheel drive, and the AWD-only Hybrid trim with a 3.5-liter V6 mated to an eCVT.\n\nThe Highlander is also approved for use as a New York City taxicab.\n\nA refreshed 2017 model year Highlander appeared at the New York International Auto Show in March 2016 with sales starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. In V6 powered models, an eight-speed automatic replaced the six-speeder and the revised V6 engine (now designated \"2GR-FKS\") added Toyota's D4-S direct injection fuel system. The new Highlander has a new fascia with restyled headlights and taillights, new SE grade, and XLE and LE Hybrid grades plus new exterior and interior colors.\n\nPre-facelift styling\nPost-facelift styling\nChinese market facelift styling\n\nThe fourth generation Highlander was unveiled at the New York International Auto Show on 17 April 2019. It is based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA-K) platform. It is offered in five model grades which include the L, LE, XLE, Limited and Platinum. In the United States, the fourth generation Highlander gasoline model went on sale on 18 December 2019 for the 2020 model year. The hybrid model went available in February 2020. The Highlander/Kluger for European/Australian markets will be available in early 2021, a year late from the US models due to the extensive engineering work for right-hand-drive models.\n\nAll models come equipped with Toyota Safety Sense 2.0.\n\nToyota set a Highlander sales record in the US in 2018, selling 244,511 Highlanders.\n\n"}

{"id": "2168301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168301", "title": "In the Woods", "text": "In the Woods\n\nIn the Woods is a 2007 mystery novel by Tana French about a pair of Irish detectives and their investigation of the murder of a twelve-year-old girl. It is the first book in French's Dublin Murder Squad series. The novel won several awards such as the 2008 Edgar Award for Best First Novel by an American Author, the 2008 Barry Award for Best First Novel, the 2008 Macavity Award for Best First Mystery Novel, and the 2008 Anthony Award for Best First Novel. \"In the Woods\" and \"The Likeness\", the second book of the Dublin Murder Squad series, are the inspiration for the BBC and Starz's 2019 \"Dublin Murders\", an eight-episode series.\n\nTwenty-two years prior to the novel's events, twelve year-old Adam and his two best friends failed to come home after playing in the familiar woods bordering their Irish housing estate. The Gardaí find Adam shivering, clawing the bark of a nearby tree, with blood in his shoes and slash marks on his back. His friends are never found. He is unable to say what happened to them. Now using his middle name, Rob, he is a detective with the Murder Squad. His amnesia holds to the present day.\n\nThe plot of the novel circles around the murder of a twelve-year-old girl, Katy Devlin, whose case Rob and his partner Cassie Maddox are assigned to investigate. The body is found in the same woods where Rob's friends disappeared, at an archaeological dig site; and the coincidence is enough to make Rob nervous, though he insists to his partner that he is fine.\n\nCassie and Rob have been partners for a few years and get along famously, teasing one another and completing one another's thoughts. Cassie is one of the few people who knows the truth about Rob's past. There are many rumours that they are romantically involved, though both of them scoff at the idea, despite the fact that they live almost like a married couple, spending a lot of time at Cassie's cooking dinner for one another, drinking wine, and having Rob crash on Cassie's couch across the room.\n\nKaty's murder takes the pair along many lines of investigation. Her death might be related to her father's protests against the new motorway meant to go straight through the dig site, or one of the students on the dig might have attacked her. She might have been abused by her father or someone else (her mother, twin sister, or older sister) in the family. She might have been previously poisoned over time. Or it might be related to the disappearance of Rob's friends, as a hair clip that one of his friends was wearing that day appeared near the crime scene.\n\nThese possibilities are investigated, but the detectives come up frustratingly empty-handed at every turn. The case messes with Rob's psyche as he tries to remember details about the two previous disappearances in case it would help. He tries spending the night in the woods, but freaks out and calls Cassie to pick him up. He's afraid to sleep again, thinking that he'll just have nightmares, so Cassie allows him into her bed, where they make love.\n\nRob feels immensely awkward after and can't go back to their normal jokey-insult ways, but he also feels that he can't start a relationship with her. Their partnership deteriorates just as they start to uncover new leads in the case, and they are unable to discuss the case and get along the way they used to.\n\nRob goes back to the dig site alone, where all the students are frantically digging before the site is shut down for the construction of the motorway. He comes to a realisation and calls in the forensics team again, who discover the location of the murder in a shed to which only three people have the key. After some heavy interrogation, one of the suspects confesses, though his motive is far from clear.\n\nIt becomes clearer when the suspect contends that he had been dating Katy's older sister, Rosalind. When questioned by Cassie, Rosalind denies it and any involvement in Katy's death, but she also makes a comment that Cassie is obviously sleeping with Rob. Cassie takes it in stride; \nbut, after the interrogation, she has an idea of how to get a confession out of Rosalind: Go to her and admit sleeping with Rob and promise to keep her updated on the case if she promises not to tell.\n\nRosalind’s psychopathic tendencies get the better of her; and, once she knows that she has Cassie in her debt, she brags about the whole thing and how she got the murderer to come up with the idea by telling him that all three girls were being sexually abused by their father, but that Katy liked it and was therefore their father’s favourite. Rosalind also told him that Katy told their father lies to make him beat them and would watch and laugh and that, if Katy were gone, then they would be happy. She also admitted to Cassie that Katy was strong-willed and wouldn’t always do as Rosalind told her, so she had poisoned her to make her sick. After this confession, recorded on a wire, Cassie arrests her and takes her in; but, because Rosalind was a few months from turning 18 (though she had told Rob previously that she was already 18), the confession is invalid. She is released with a smug smile.\n\nThe Murder Squad Superintendent has learned that Rob is actually Adam Ryan and transfers him to menial desk work in the General Unit. He never returns to the Murder Squad. Cassie starts dating another member of the squad and eventually becomes engaged. Rob is heartbroken and calls her, but it's too late. He goes to the dig site to see the motorway construction has begun and thinks that he'll never regain his lost memories of that night.\n\nThomas Gaughan of \"Booklist\" gave \"In the Woods\" a starred review and hailed it as “...a superior novel about cops, murder, memory, relationships, and modern Ireland. The characters of Ryan and Maddox, as well as a handful of others, are vividly developed... Equally striking is the picture of contemporary Ireland, booming economically and fixated on the shabbiest aspects of American popular culture. An outstanding debut and a series to watch for procedural fans.\" \"Publishers Weekly\" praised author French, saying she “... expertly walks the line between police procedural and psychological thriller in her debut\" and that \"Ryan and Maddox are empathetic and flawed heroes, whose partnership and friendship elevate the narrative beyond a gory tale of murdered children and repressed childhood trauma.\" \"Kirkus Reviews\" said of the novel, \"When not lengthily bogged down in angst, a readable, non-formulaic police procedural with a twist. It's ultimately the confession of a damaged man.\"\n\n\n\n"}

They held that the holding of secular office by a cleric was against the canons of the Church. The Synod released an announcement reporting the position of the bishops, and stating that the Archbishop would announce his response at a later time.\n\nMakarios issued his response on 19 March. In it he accused the three bishops of having conspired among themselves and with other people outside the church, hinting at the Junta of the Colonels ruling Greece at the time, and at George Grivas, leader of the EOKA guerrilla organization, who had secretly returned to Cyprus. Makarios argued that the office of President of the Republic of Cyprus could not be called secular at a time when the Orthodox Greeks of Cyprus were struggling for their national survival, and that in the circumstances the holding of secular office did not confer on the Archbishop any personal reward, but was an onerous and bitter duty which he could not shirk.\n\nThe bishops maintained their position and the crisis continued. It finally came to a climax after the unopposed re-election of Makarios to the Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus on 8 February 1973. The three bishops summoned Makarios to account for himself before an extraordinary session of the Holy Synod which they called for 7 March 1973. Makarios replied on 6 March, stating that the Synod the three bishops had called was unconstitutional and therefore any decision it reached would be invalid. The three bishops met among themselves and decided to defrock Makarios.\n\nMakarios called a Major Synod comprising representatives from all Orthodox Patriarchates. They all responded, except the Church of Greece and the Ecumenical Patriarchate whose seat is in Istanbul, Turkey. The Major Synod convened on 5–6 July 1973. It decided to annul the defrocking of Makarios, and to call the three bishops to audience so they could express their views. The three bishops refused to attend the Major Synod, which convened again on 14 July and defrocked them.\n\nWhen Makarios was forced to flee the island after the military coup of 15 July 1974, the three defrocked bishops entered the limelight again. The coup leaders, having appointed Nikos Giorgades Sampson as President of the Republic, also installed Gennadios as the new Archbishop of Cyprus. Sampson was sworn in as president in a ceremony conducted by Gennadios in the presence of Kyprianos and Anthemos. However, the coupist government collapsed on 23 July as a result of the Turkish military invasion of Cyprus on 20 July. Glafkos Klerides, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, constitutionally took over the powers of the President in the absence of Makarios, but agreed to be sworn in as President before Gennadios, an action which Klerides's detractors suggest was indicative of a pro-coupist orientation on his part at the time.

Her performance in \"After Miss Julie\" at the Donmar Warehouse made her a star of the London stage and earned her a nomination for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress of 2003.\n\nReilly was born and raised in Chessington, London, England, the daughter of a hospital receptionist mother and a police officer father. She attended Tolworth Girls' School in Kingston, where she studied drama for GCSE. Her grandparents are Irish.\n\nReilly wrote to the producers of the television drama \"Prime Suspect\" to ask for work, and six months later she auditioned for a role in an episode of \"Prime Suspect 4: Inner Circle\", which was broadcast on ITV on 7 May 1995. Six years later, she again appeared alongside Helen Mirren in the film \"Last Orders\".\n\nHer first professional role was followed by a series of parts on the English stage. She worked with Terry Johnson in four productions: \"Elton John’s Glasses\" (1997), \"The London Cuckolds\" (1998), \"The Graduate\" (2000) and \"Piano/Forte\" (2006). Johnson wrote \"Piano/Forte\" for her and said, \"Kelly is possibly the most natural, dyed-in-the-wool, deep-in-the-bone actress I've ever worked with.\" Reilly has stated that she learned the most as an actor from Karel Reisz, who directed her in \"The Yalta Game\" in Dublin in 2001. She said, \"He was my masterclass. There is no way I would have been able to do \"Miss Julie\" if I hadn't done that play.\"\n\nBy 2000, Reilly felt she was being typecast in comedy roles, and actively sought out a role as the young Amy in \"Last Orders\", directed by Fred Schepisi. This was followed by a role in the Royal Court's 2001 rerun of Sarah Kane's \"Blasted\". \"The Times\" called her \"theatrical Viagra\". In 2002, Reilly starred alongside Audrey Tautou and Romain Duris as Wendy, an English Erasmus student, in the French comedy \"L'Auberge espagnole\" (\"The Spanish Apartment\"). She reprised her role in the 2005 sequel, \"Les Poupées russes\" (\"The Russian Dolls\") and the 2013 follow-up, \"Casse-tête chinois\" (\"Chinese Puzzle\"). Also in 2005, Reilly had roles in such films as \"Mrs Henderson Presents\" and \"Pride & Prejudice\".\n\nReilly's first lead role came in 2008 in the horror film \"Eden Lake\" and, in 2009, she had a high-profile role on prime-time British television in \"Above Suspicion\". Reilly also appeared in three major films: \"Sherlock Holmes\", \"Triage\", and \"Me and Orson Welles\".\n\nIn 2011, Reilly reprised her role as Mary Watson in \"\". In 2012, Reilly appeared opposite Sam Rockwell in \"A Single Shot\" and had a leading role in Robert Zemeckis' \"Flight\" opposite Denzel Washington. In 2014, Reilly starred with Greg Kinnear in the film \"Heaven is for Real\" and in the John Michael McDonagh film \"Calvary\". The same year Reilly starred in the short-lived ABC series \"Black Box\", as Catherine Black, a famed neuroscientist who explores and solves the mysteries of the brain (the black box) while hiding her own bipolar disorder from the world.\n\nIn 2015, Reilly starred in the second season of HBO's \"True Detective\" as Jordan Semyon, the wife of Vince Vaughn's character Frank Semyon. The same year, Reilly made her Broadway debut opposite Clive Owen and Eve Best in Harold Pinter's play \"Old Times\" at the American Airlines Theatre.\n\nKelly was cast in the leading female role in the sweeping Western-style U.S. series \"Yellowstone\", a Paramount Network drama that debuted on 20 June 2018. Reilly plays Beth Dutton, daughter to John Dutton, played by Kevin Costner. Reilly's and Costner's characters are constantly at war with several outside parties who want to gain control of the Duttons' family land.\n\nReilly's performance in \"After Miss Julie\" at the Donmar Warehouse made her a star of the London stage and earned her a nomination for a Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actress of 2003. Aged 26, she was the youngest person ever nominated for that award. In 2005, she won Best Newcomer Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her role as Wendy in \"The Russian Dolls\" (\"Les Poupées Russes\"). In 2006, Reilly won the Empire Award for Best Newcomer for her role in the British comedy film, \"Mrs Henderson Presents\". She was nominated once again for an Olivier Award for her performance as Desdemona in the acclaimed production of \"Othello\" at the Donmar Warehouse in 2009. Reilly was nominated for Best Actress at the British Independent Film Awards for \"Eden Lake\" in 2010. She won the Spotlight Award at the 2012 Hollywood Film Festival, for her performance as Nicole in \"Flight\".\n\nReilly was engaged to actor Jonah Lotan from 2007 to 2009. Reilly married Kyle Baugher, a financier, in 2012.\n"}

Her father Tsuneo Matsudaira (1877–1949) was Japanese ambassador to the United States (1924) and later to Great Britain (1928), and still later, Imperial Household Minister (1936–45, 1946–47). Her mother was the former Nobuko Nabeshima.\n\nAlthough technically born a commoner, she was a scion of distinguished aristocratic families with close ties to the Japanese Imperial Family on both sides. Her paternal grandfather, Katamori Matsudaira, was the last \"daimyō\" of Aizu, a cadet branch of the Tokugawa dynasty. Her maternal grandfather was Marquis Naohiro Nabeshima, former \"daimyō\" of Saga. Her mother's elder sister, Itsuko (1882–1976), married Prince Morimasa Nashimoto, an uncle of Empress Kōjun.\n\nIn 1925, while her father was ambassador to the United States, Setsuko was educated at the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. (1925–1928). Upon her return to Japan, Empress Teimei chose Setsuko to marry her second son, Prince Chichibu. She married the Prince after her uncle, Viscount Morio Matsudaira, formally adopted her, thus removing the status incongruity between the prince and his bride, by making Setsuko the adopted daughter of a viscount.\n\nOn 28 September 1928, aged 19, she wed Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, and became Princess Chichibu. The bride and groom were eighth cousins, thrice removed, as both were descended from Nabeshima Katsushige, the first lord of Saga. Prince and Princess Chichibu had no children, as Princess Chichibu's only pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. But by all accounts their marriage was filled with love and happiness for each other.\n\nIn 1937, the prince and princess were sent on a tour of Western Europe which took several months. They represented Japan at the May 1937 coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey and subsequently visited Sweden and the Netherlands as the guests of King Gustav V and Queen Wilhelmina, respectively. Princess Chichibu stayed in Switzerland while her husband met Adolf Hitler in Nuremberg at the end of the trip. She felt a great love for the United States and for England and, as an anglophile, was greatly saddened by Japan's entry into the Second World War on the side of the Axis powers.\n\nAfter the Prince's death of tuberculosis in 1953, Princess Chichibu became president of the Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, honorary president of the Britain-Japan Society, the Sweden-Japan Society, and an honorary vice president of the Japanese Red Cross. The Princess, who was fluent in English, made several semi-official visits to Great Britain and Sweden.\n\nPrincess Chichibu died before her 86th birthday of heart failure on 25 August 1995.\n\nHer autobiography, which was published posthumously as \"The Silver Drum: A Japanese Imperial Memoir\", was translated in English by Dorothy Britton.\n\nSetsuko was styled as \"Her Imperial Highness The Princess Chichibu\". Prior to her marriage she was styled as \"The Honourable Setsuko Matsudaira\".\n\n\nKing Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden invested her with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Seraphim on 8 April 1969. On 23 July 1962, she became an Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. On 9 October 1978, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II) invested Princess Chichibu as an Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.\n\n\nSetsuko's patriline is the line from which she is descended father to son.\n\nThe existence of a verifiable link between the Nitta clan and the Tokugawa/Matsudaira clan remains somewhat in dispute.\n\n\n"}

Since its inaugural year in 2002, it has become an outlet for independent filmmakers in all genres to release their work to a broad audience.\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, the festival received over 8,600 film submissions and held 1,500 screenings. The festival's program line-up includes a variety of independent films including documentaries, narrative features and shorts, as well as a program of family-friendly films. The festival also features panel discussions with people in the entertainment world and a music lounge produced with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) to showcase artists. One of the more distinctive components of the festival is its artists awards program in which emerging and established artists celebrate filmmakers by providing original works of art that are given to the filmmakers' competition winners. Past artists of the artists award program include Chuck Close, Alex Katz, and Julian Schnabel.\n\nThe festival now draws an estimated three million people—including often-elusive celebrities from the worlds of art, film, and music—and generates $600 million annually.\n\nThe Tribeca Film Festival was founded in 2002 by Jane Rosenthal, Robert De Niro, and Craig Hatkoff, reportedly in response to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the consequent loss of vitality in the Tribeca neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, although there are reports that its founding was underway prior to the events of 9/11.\nThe inaugural festival launched after 120 days of planning with the help of more than 1,300 volunteers. It was attended by more than 150,000 people and featured several up-and-coming filmmakers. The festival included juried narrative, documentary and short film competitions; a restored classics series; a best of New York series curated by Martin Scorsese; 13 major panel discussions; an all-day family festival; and the premieres of studio films \"\", \"About A Boy\", the American remake of \"Insomnia\", \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\", and \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\".\n\nThe 2003 festival brought more than 300,000 people. The festival showcased an expanded group of independent features, documentaries and short films from around the world, coupled with studio premieres, panel discussions, music and comedy concerts, a family festival, sports activities, and outdoor movie screenings along the Hudson River. The family festival featured children's movie screenings, storytelling, family panels, workshops, and interactive games culminating in a daylong street fair that drew a crowd estimated at 250,000 people.\n\nAt the end of 2003, De Niro purchased the theater at 54 Varick Street which had housed the recently closed Screening Room, an art house that had shown independent films nightly, renaming it the Tribeca Cinema. It became one of the venues of the festival.\n\nIn an effort to serve its mission of bringing independent film to the widest possible audience, in 2006, the festival expanded its reach in New York City and internationally. In New York City, Tribeca hosted screenings throughout Manhattan as the festival's 1,000-plus screening schedule outgrew the capacity downtown. Internationally, the Festival brought films to the Rome Film Festival. As part of the celebrations in Rome, Tribeca was awarded the first-ever \"Steps and Stars\" award, presented on the Spanish Steps. A total of 169 feature films and 99 shorts were selected from 4,100 film submissions, including 1,950 feature submissions—three times the total submissions from the first festival in 2002. The festival featured 90 world premieres, nine international premieres, 31 North American premieres, 6 U.S. premieres, and 28 New York City premieres.\n\nIn 2009, Rosenthal, Hatkoff and De Niro were named number 14 on \"Barron's\" list of the world's top 25 philanthropists for their role in regenerating TriBeCa's economy after September 11.\n\nAs of 2010, the festival is run as a business by Tribeca Enterprises. Andrew Essex has been the CEO of Tribeca Enterprises since January, 2016.\n\nIn 2011, \"L.A. Noire\" became the first video game to be recognized by the Tribeca Film Festival. In 2013, \"\", featuring Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe, became only the second game to be premiered at the festival.\n\nThe 19th Tribeca Film Festival, originally scheduled for April 15–26 2020, was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Organizers told ticket holders to monitor its website for ticket refund information, implying the event will not be rescheduled. Organizers also asked people to monitor its website for more on how they are “moving forward”, without making any statements or commitments on holding future editions of the film festival.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is usually for the purpose of gaining an advantage from the marriage.\n\nDefinitions of sham marriage vary by jurisdiction, but are often related to immigration. The essential point in the varying definitions is whether the couple intend to live in a real marital relationship, to establish a life together. A typical definition by the UK Home Office in 2015:\n\nWhile referred to as a \"sham\" or \"fake\" because of its motivation, the union itself is legally valid if it conforms to the formal legal requirements for marriage in the jurisdiction. Arranging or entering into such a marriage to deceive public officials is in itself a violation of the law of some countries, for example the US.\n\nAfter a period, couples often divorce if there is no purpose in remaining married.\n\nSham marriages are distinct from marriage fraud, which is a type of romance scam, in which one spouse is unwittingly taken advantage of by the foreign spouse who feigns romantic interest, typically in order to obtain a residence permit or for money.\n\nCommon reasons for sham marriages are to gain immigration, residency, work, or citizenship rights for one of the spouses.\n\nThere have been cases of people entering into a sham marriage to avoid suspicion of homosexuality or bisexuality. For example, Hollywood studios had allegedly requested homosexual actors, such as Rock Hudson, to conceal their homosexuality in a so-called lavender marriage.\n\nSince the introduction of stricter modern immigration laws in First World countries, sham marriages have become a common method to allow a foreigner to reside, and possibly gain citizenship, in the more desirable country of the spouse. The couple marries with knowledge that the marriage is solely for the purpose of obtaining the favorable immigration status, and without intending to live as a couple. This is frequently arranged as a business transaction with payment of a sum of money, and occurs more commonly with foreigners already in the country.\nIn the UK the Border Agency issued guidance to clergy in April 2011 to help prevent sham marriages intended only to gain the right to reside. English and Welsh clergy may perform a marriage, according to the law there. They have been advised not to offer to publish banns for any marriage where one partner is from outside the European Union. Instead, the couple were to be asked to apply for a licence; if a member of the clergy is not satisfied that a marriage is genuine, they must make that clear to the person responsible for granting the licence.\n\nSince the Home Office hostile environment policy started in 2012, there has been criticism in the UK of heavy-handed action affecting genuine marriages. Genuine weddings have been interrupted, and dawn raids have been made to check whether couples are sharing a bed. People have been detained for months on wrongly being accused of being in a sham marriage. In 2018, 1,618 marriages reported by registrars as being suspicious were investigated; the Home Office refused to say how many were found to be sham.\n\nIn August 2010, a senior registrar in Ireland estimated that 15% of civil marriages were bogus, for the purpose of gaining residency.\n\nIn United States immigration law, marriage not made in good faith and for purposes of immigration fraud is a felony, subject to a penalty of a US$250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence on the citizen, and deportation of the foreigner. The INS and the Justice Department said that they did not have accurate numbers on the rate of attempted marriage fraud. In the 2009 fiscal year, 506 of the 241,154 petitions filed were denied for suspected fraud, a rate of less than 0.09%.\n\nIn Canada, legislation on sham marriages was strengthened in 2012. Continuous controversy arose regarding the issue; Canadian officials have been accused both of being too harsh and harassing couples and of being too lenient in deciding what is a genuine relationship. In addition, there have been objections to the policy from women's organizations, which argued that the new policy which requires the sponsor and the new spouse to live in a \"genuine relationship\" for two years endangers women who are victims of domestic violence. Although there is an exception to this rule in cases of abuse, the policy has been accused of being too weak (as abuse is difficult to prove).\n\n\n"}

Located in Administrative Zone 3 of the Afar Region, above a gorge on the Awash River, after which the town is named, the town lies on the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway, which crosses the gorge by a bridge there. It is the largest settlement in Awash Fentale woreda.\n\nAwash lies outside the Awash National Park, which is known for its wildlife, for the Mount Fentale caldera and for the Filwoha Hot Springs. Its market is held on Mondays, where Afar and Kereyu crafts can be found.\n\nAn iron bridge over the Awash had been built at the present location of Awash by Emperor Menelik II's favorite, Alfred Ilg, around 1890; this bridge replaced an earlier wooden one. The construction had to face the great difficulty of transporting the girders from Djibouti, but once the material had arrived, the structure had been finished in ten days; however Emperor Menelik had used for other purposes the cement imported from Europe to build the bridge with. When Count Gleichen encountered the bridge in 1897, during his mission to Emperor Menelik, he found \"the bridge would be too weak to stand anything but ordinary pack-animal traffic. For nine months in the year it is blocked at each end by a broad abattis of thorn-bush, - to prevent people from using it when the river is fordable, - but during the rains it is left open.\"\n\nAwash grew up around the railroad station, which was opened not long after 1917 when the railway had reached this far into Ethiopia. A hotel for passengers was built in Awash about that time. The fourth post office in Ethiopia (after Harar, Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa) was established in Awash on 1 September 1923, but it may not have been much of a point of origin and arrival but rather a place on the line between the capital and the coast.\n\nDuring the Italian occupation, Awash still provided a post office, a telegraph station, the hotel, and restaurant. The town was occupied in April 1941 by the 22nd East African Brigade of the King's African Rifles, who had advanced for three days from Dire Dawa. Elements of this brigade afterwards continued their advance across the Awash at this point on 3 April 1941, although the road and rail bridge had been demolished by the retreating Italians. By 1953, the bridge had been rebuilt.\n\nOne of the five camps to train conscripts of the People's Militia (reconstituted in the spring of 1977 as the \"Red Army\") was located at Awash.\n\nOn January 13, 1985 a train derailed at Awash on the Ethio-Djibouti Railways plunging four of its five carriages into a ravine; the crash was estimated to have killed at least 428 and injured 500 of the estimated 1,000 on board. It was the worst rail accident in African history. It is believed that the cause of the crash was the excessive speed of the train round a curve on a bridge across the ravine. The derailment happened at 13:40 between Arba and Awash.\n\nBased on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Awash has an estimated total population of 11,053, of whom 5,748 are men and 5,305 were women. According to the 1994 national census, the town had a population of 8,684.\n"}
{"id": "2168353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168353", "title": "Adrenergic nerve fibre", "text": "Adrenergic nerve fibre\n\nAn adrenergic nerve fibre is a neuron for which the neurotransmitter is either adrenaline (epinephrine), noradrenaline or dopamine. These neurotransmitters are released at a location known as the synapse, which is a junction point between the axon of one nerve cell and the dendrite of another. The neurotransmitters are first released from the axon and then bind to the receptor site on the dendrite. Adrenergic nerve terminals are found in the secondary neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, one of two deviations of the autonomic nervous system which is responsible for the fight-or-flight response. This system increases heart rate, slows digestion, dilates pupils, and also controls the secretion of apocrine sweat glands in the dermal layer of skin, in addition to other responses.\n\nThe nerve fibre is a thread-like extension of a nerve cell that includes the axon which may or may not be encased in a myelinated sheath. The androgenic nerve fibre when myelinated increases the speed of transmission for an action potential across the length of the cell. The gaps in the sheath along the axon are call the node of ranvier.\n\nThere are several types of adrenergic receptors which are identified by their differing sensitivities to various drugs. Neurons in the central nervous system contain α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors and β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. All four kinds of receptors are also found in the various organs of the body aside from the brain. They are responsible for the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine when they act as hormones outside the central nervous system. In the brain, all autoreceptors appear to be of the α2 type. (The drug idazoxan blocks α2 autoreceptors and hence acts as an antagonist.) All adrenergic receptors are metabotropic, coupled to G proteins that control the production of second messengers. Adrenergic receptors can produce both excitatory and inhibitory effects. In general, the behavioral effects of the release of norepinephrine are excitatory. In the brain the α1 receptors produce a slow depolarizing (excitatory) effect on the postsynaptic membrane, while α2 receptors produce a slow hyperpolarization (inhibitory) effect. Both types of β receptors increase the responsiveness of the postsynaptic neuron to its excitatory inputs, which presumably related to the role this neurotransmitter plays in vigilance.\n\nAdrenergic fibres innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, visceral glands, and various central nervous system structures and sense organs. Their function is enhancing, compared to the inhibiting action of the cholinergic fibres of the parasympathetic system. Peripheral adrenergic neurons integrate signals from other nerves of the central nervous system and peripheral sense organs. An adrenergic nerve impulse is triggered when one nerve fires repeatedly or when several nerves fire simultaneously which can cause an additive effect leading to a greater stimulus. Adrenergic neurons, in particular the α2 autoreceptors found in the brain, are also involved in sexual behavior and in the control of appetite.\n"}

Alfaro\n\nRicardo Joaquín Alfaro Jované (August 20, 1882 – February 23, 1971), served as 16th President of Panama from January 16, 1931 to June 5, 1932. He belonged to the Liberal Party.\n\nDr. Alfaro was born in Panama.\n\nHe began a career in the diplomatic service in 1905 as under-secretary for foreign affairs. He was first assigned to the U.S. in 1912 as legal counselor of the Panamanian legation for the Panama-Costa Rica border dispute. Dr. Alfaro was also involved in settling numerous disputes arising from the construction of the Panama Canal. From 1915 to 1918, he was judge of a joint commission between Panama and the United States for settling claims relating to expropriations for the construction of the Canal. Later, in 1934 to 1936 and again, in 1953, Dr. Alfaro was involved in critical negotiations relating to Panama-U.S. relations concerning the Canal.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1930, and from 1933 to 1936, Dr. Alfaro was Panamanian envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the U.S.. In 1946, he was appointed Panama's minister of foreign relations; however, he resigned in 1947 to protest a proposed agreement with the U.S. relating to the Panama Canal.\n\nHe was elected as the first presidential designate by the National Assembly for the term 1928-1930. In 1931, after a revolution in Panama, Dr. Alfaro was invited to become his country's president, a position he accepted and held from January 16, 1931 through June 5, 1932. In 1940, he was defeated in the presidential election; however continued to serve his country by helping to draft a new constitution for Panama in 1944.\n\nA significant portion of Dr. Alfaro's service to his country related to his work in the United Nations. In 1945, he headed the U.N. Relief and Recovery Administration mission to ten Latin American republics. He was also Panama's delegate to the U.N. conference on international organization in San Francisco and chairman of the special committee that drafted the Spanish text of the United Nations Charter of 1945.\n\nIn 1949, Dr. Alfaro was chairman of the legal committee of the third session of the U.N. General Assembly that drew up the text of the Convention on Genocide. From 1949 to 1953 served as member of the International Law Commission. In that capacity, he promoted the Declaration on the Rights and Duties of States, and his draft became the basis of the version eventually approved by the commission. On June 3, 1949, he was appointed by that commission as rapporteur on the desirability of establishing a permanent court to try persons guilty of genocide.\n\nIn addition to his governmental and diplomatic experience, Dr. Alfaro's professional acumen derives from a background in law. He was formerly a professor of civil and international law in Panama universities. He was also a member of the subcommittee that drafted treaties and arbitrated for the Inter-American Conference on Conciliation and Arbitration held in the U.S. in 1929. From 1959 to 1964, Dr. Alfaro was a judge in the International Court of Justice, serving his last three years as vice-president. In 1964, Dr. Alfaro retired from his official duties.\n\nDr. Alfaro was the author of many articles and books on Panama, and was the recipient of numerous awards and citations for a career dedicated to improving conditions both in his country and globally.\n\nDr. Alfaro died in his eighty-ninth year in Panama City on February 23, 1971. He was survived by his wife, Amelia Lyons de Alfaro; three sons, Dr. Victor Ricardo of Washington, Ivan Jose of Lima, Peru, and Rogelio Edwin of Panama City; two daughters, Mrs. Frank H. Weller (née Amelia or Amelita Victoria) of Potomac, Maryland, and Mrs. H. Cabell Maddux (née Yolanda Maria) of McLean, Virginia; and many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, among them the singer Nancy Ames, and attorney and TV personality Elbert Alfaro in Miami Lakes, Florida.\n\nThroughout his activities as professor of law and member of various judicial bodies, Alfaro promoted the notion of universal criminal jurisdiction and government accountability at all levels. An example to that effect can be seen in that during the deliberations on the law of treaties at the ILC, he opposed the notion that an international agreement reached by exchange of notes did not require ratification by the state legislature of the contracting states.\n\nHe held the Nuremberg Principles in high esteem and viewed them as an integral part of the principles of world order and world peace.\n"}

On January 1, 2011 Backa merged with two other districts of Gothenburg, Kärra-Rödbo and Tuve-Säve, to form the district of Norra Hisingen. This change was part of a larger reorganisation, reducing the number of districts in Gothenburg from 20 to 10.\n\nBacka is predominantly a residential area, featuring mostly high and low rise apartment buildings, many built during the Million Programme. These are made up of a mix between rented apartments and privately owned condominiums. Backa also features several villa areas. Backa had a population of 23,570 at the 2008 census. The demographics are slowly changing, and an ageing population has led the local government to focus increasingly on accommodation for the elderly. There were approximately 160 associations in Backa, ranging from sports clubs, such as the football club Hisingsbacka FC and Backatorps IF, handball club Backa HK Sharks and floorball club IBF Backadalen Red Lions, to ones associated with cultural and religious questions.\n\nThe first time Backa is mentioned is in Röde bok, a record of the properties of the Bishop of Oslo in the 1390s. Backa belonged to Norway in the 13th century, and due to the many wars between Norway, Denmark and Sweden during that period, Backa was a strategically important area. The mouth of the Göta Älv river was a particularly strategic point. Backa became a part of Sweden in 1658.\n\nIn 1938 the decision was made to incorporate Backa into Gothenburg. Due to opposition from the residents and from the local government, this process was not completed until 1948.\n\nDue to its fertile soil, Backa remained a rural area up until the 1960s, but during the Million Programme, a project which involved the building of one million apartments between the years of 1965 and 1975, large residential areas were constructed in Backa, which led to a rapid increase in population. Between 1963 and 1965, Bunnsbo Torg, a town square with surrounding apartment buildings, was constructed in southern Backa, and Northern Backa expanded between 1968 and 1971.\n\nBacka Kyrka is a church, constructed in 1864. It was not inaugurated until four years later, in 1868. According to blue prints by the architect J F Åbom, the construction costs were estimated at 40,453 SEK. Many reparations and changes have been made to the church since its construction, and the originally tall tower was replaced with the current, shorter, one in 1927; the current retable was installed in 1906; and the cross on top of the building is from 1955. For the 100th anniversary in 1964, the church received generous allowances, which were used to repaint the roof and the benches.\n\nBacka Kyrka stands in the spot of two earlier churches. The first was Medeltidskyrkan, which was constructed in 1692, and the second was 1700–tals kyrkan, an 18th-century church which was demolished to accommodate the construction of Backa Kyrka.\n\nSelma Lagerlöfs Torg is a town square, featuring shops, a library, a school, a kindergarten, a post office, and other services. There is also a cultural centre, Backa Kulturhus, where children can playact and dance.\n\nBacka Folkets Hus, which was previously known as Tingstads Folkets Hus, was inaugurated in 1924 after years of collecting funds. It was built as a meeting hall for the people of Backa and the outlying areas, where they could come together for dances, chess, and film screenings. In 1971, the building was sold to the City of Gothenburg, dissolving the association which had run the building's services and events. After some years, however, demands for a meeting hall increased, and the association was reinstated, with the building open to the public. In the early 1990s, the meeting hall became an important location for local youths, where they could engage in such activities as graffiti and break dancing.\n\nBacka is connected to central Gothenburg through Göta älvbron, a bridge with sections for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as for cars, busses and trams. By car one can also reach Backa by following motorway E6 through the Tingstadtunneln tunnel.\n"}

{"id": "2168393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168393", "title": "Lanthanide contraction", "text": "Lanthanide contraction\n\nThe lanthanide contraction is the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii of the elements in the lanthanide series from atomic number 57, lanthanum, to 71, lutetium, which results in smaller than otherwise expected ionic radii for the subsequent elements starting with 72, hafnium. The term was coined by the Norwegian geochemist Victor Goldschmidt in his series \"Geochemische Verteilungsgesetze der Elemente\".\n\nThe effect results from poor shielding of nuclear charge (nuclear attractive force on electrons) by 4f electrons; the 6s electrons are drawn towards the nucleus, thus resulting in a smaller atomic radius.\n\nIn single-electron atoms, the average separation of an electron from the nucleus is determined by the subshell it belongs to, and decreases with increasing charge on the nucleus; this in turn leads to a decrease in atomic radius. In multi-electron atoms, the decrease in radius brought about by an increase in nuclear charge is partially offset by increasing electrostatic repulsion among electrons. In particular, a \"shielding effect\" operates: i.e., as electrons are added in outer shells, electrons already present shield the outer electrons from nuclear charge, making them experience a lower effective charge on the nucleus. The shielding effect exerted by the inner electrons decreases in the order \"s\" > \"p\" > \"d\" > \"f\". Usually, as a particular subshell is filled in a period, atomic radius decreases. This effect is particularly pronounced in the case of lanthanides, as the 4\"f\" subshell which is filled across these elements is not very effective at shielding the outer shell (n=5 and n=6) electrons. Thus the shielding effect is less able to counter the decrease in radius caused by increasing nuclear charge. This leads to \"lanthanide contraction\". The ionic radius drops from 103 pm for lanthanum(III) to 86.1 pm for lutetium(III).\n\nAbout 10% of the lanthanide contraction has been attributed to relativistic effects.\n\nThe results of the increased attraction of the outer shell electrons across the lanthanide period may be divided into effects on the lanthanide series itself including the decrease in ionic radii, and influences on the following or post-lanthanide elements.\n\nThe ionic radii of the lanthanides decrease from 103 pm (La) to 86 pm (Lu) in the lanthanide series.\n\nAcross the lanthanide series, electrons are added to the \"4f\" shell. This first \"f\" shell is inside the full \"5s\" and \"5p\" shells (as well as the \"6s\" shell in the neutral atom); the \"4f\" shell is well-localized near the atomic nucleus and has little effect on chemical bonding. The decrease in atomic and ionic radii does affect their chemistry, however. Without the lanthanide contraction, a chemical separation of lanthanides would be extremely difficult. However, this contraction makes the chemical separation of period 5 and period 6 transition metals of the same group rather difficult.\n\nThere is a general trend of increasing Vickers hardness, Brinell hardness, density and melting point from lanthanum to lutetium (with europium and ytterbium being the most notable exceptions; in the metallic state, they are divalent rather than trivalent). Lutetium is the hardest and densest lanthanide and has the highest melting point.\n\nThe elements following the lanthanides in the periodic table are influenced by the lanthanide contraction. The radii of the period-6 transition metals are smaller than would be expected if there were no lanthanides, and are in fact very similar to the radii of the period-5 transition metals, since the effect of the additional electron shell is almost entirely offset by the lanthanide contraction.\n\nFor example, the atomic radius of the metal zirconium, Zr, (a period-5 transition element) is 159 pm and that of hafnium, Hf, (the corresponding period-6 element) is 156 pm. The ionic radius of Zr is 79 pm and that of Hf is 78 pm. The radii are very similar even though the number of electrons increases from 40 to 72 and the atomic mass increases from 91.22 to 178.49 g/mol. The increase in mass and the unchanged radii lead to a steep increase in density from 6.51 to 13.35 g/cm.\n\nZirconium and hafnium therefore have very similar chemical behaviour, having closely similar radii and electron configurations. Radius-dependent properties such as lattice energies, solvation energies, and stability constants of complexes are also similar. Because of this similarity, hafnium is found only in association with zirconium, which is much more abundant. This also meant that hafnium was discovered as a separate element in 1923, 134 years after zirconium was discovered in 1789. Titanium, on the other hand, is in the same group, but differs enough from those two metals that it is seldom found with them.\n\n\n"}

However in the following few years he came to be overshadowed by his Australian contemporary Adam Scott, who is less than a year older than Baddeley but reached the world top 10 in 2005.\n\nIn 2002, Baddeley played on the second tier Nationwide Tour in the U.S. and placed tenth on the money list to earn a PGA Tour card for 2003. He had second-place finishes on the PGA Tour in 2003 at the Sony Open in Hawaii and 2004 at the Chrysler Classic of Tucson. However he struggled for consistency, and after a solid rookie season, when he finished 73rd on the money list, he only just retained his card in 2004, when he came 124th. In 2005 he moved back up the rankings to 78th and in 2006 he won his first PGA Tour title at the Verizon Heritage.\n\nBaddeley won his second PGA Tour tournament in early 2007 and reached the top 50 of the world rankings. By September, he had entered the top 20. His career high ranking was 17th in 2008.\n\nBaddeley was the leader after the third round of the U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club on 16 June 2007 with a two over par score of 212 (72-70-70). He finished with an 80 and ended T-13.\n\nAfter a lull in form over the following few seasons, where he was finishing only in the lower reaches of the top-125 on the money list, Baddeley returned to the winner's circle when he won the 2011 Northern Trust Open in California. He defended a one-shot third round lead over Kevin Na and veteran Fred Couples, completing a steady closing round of 69 to beat another veteran, Vijay Singh, by two strokes.\n\nIn October 2011, Baddeley was selected by Greg Norman as one of his two wildcard picks for the 2011 Presidents Cup team. He was selected along with fellow Australian Robert Allenby to compete at Royal Melbourne in November.\n\nStatistically speaking, Baddeley frequently ranks as one of the very best putters on the PGA Tour. As of 2010, he has qualified for the Tour's end-of-season statistical rankings 8 times; of those, he finished among the circuit's top 10 in putts per green in regulation five times, and among the top 15 seven times. The only qualified season in which Baddeley was not among the PGA Tour's top 15 putters by that metric came in 2004, when he finished 64th out of 196 players.\n\nBaddeley started the 2015–16 season playing out of the Past Champions category after finishing 157th in the FedEx Cup and failing to regain a PGA Tour card through the Web.com Tour Finals. He earned his first win in five years at the 2016 Barbasol Championship, beating Kim Si-woo in a four-hole playoff.\n\nBaddeley is a committed Christian and has confessed that it was his faith that prevented him giving up professional golf on numerous occasions. \n\nBaddeley's wife Richelle, whom he married on April 15, 2005, sums up Baddeley's faith in God, saying: \"It never faltered. He never asked, 'What are you trying to teach me? I want you to be the man you want me to be. I will go through these [bad] times if that is Your will'.\"\n\nRichelle has also been pivotal to Baddeley's resurgence. \"I had to learn the balance of letting him be alone when he comes home sometimes upset. It's sheer frustration from him. He's played his best, and it just hasn't happened,\" she said.\n\nBaddeley and his wife have five children: Jewel, Jolee, Jeremiah, Josiah and Crew.\n\n\"this list may be incomplete\"\n\nPGA Tour playoff record (1–1)\nCo-sanctioned by the PGA Tour of Australasia\n\nEuropean Tour playoff record (2–0)\nCo-sanctioned by the European Tour\n\nPGA Tour of Australasia playoff record (2–0)\n\nCUT = missed the half-way cut<br>\n\"T\" = tied for place\n\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nDQ = Disqualified<br>\nQF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play<br>\n\"T\" = Tied<br>\nNote that the HSBC Champions did not become a WGC event until 2009.\n\n\"* Through the 2019 season.\"<br>\n\"Note: Baddeley did not join the PGA Tour until 2003 so he was not ranked on the money list until then.\"\n\nAmateur\n\nProfessional\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2168402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168402", "title": "The Night in Lisbon", "text": "The Night in Lisbon\n\nThe Night in Lisbon () is a novel by Erich Maria Remarque published in 1962. It revolves around the plight of two German refugees in the opening months of World War II. One of the refugees relates their story during the course of a single night in Lisbon in 1942. The story he recounts is mainly a romantic one, and also contains a lot of action with arrests, escapes and near-misses. The novel is realistic, Remarque was himself a German refugee (although the novel is fictional and only loosely based on the experience of Remarque's friend, novelist Hans Habe), and provides insight into refugee life in Europe during the early days of the war. The book completed what was known as Remarque's \"emigre trilogy\" along with \"Flotsam\" and \"Arch of Triumph\". It was Remarque's last completed work.\n\nThe story takes place in the opening months of World War II. Josef Schwarz is a refugee who offers his visa and tickets for America to another refugee desperate to leave Lisbon. He does this in exchange for keeping him company throughout one night, a night in which he relates the story of his and his wife's frantic flight from Nazi Germany to Lisbon.\n\n\"The Night in Lisbon\" became an immediate bestseller in America and Britain when published in English in 1964, remaining on the \"New York Times\" Top Ten list for five months. In his review for the \"Times\", Maxwell Geismar called it a \"most brooding and thoughtful novel… it may not quite be a great novel, but it is surely one of the most absorbing and eloquent narratives of our period.\" In a 1964 book review, \"Kirkus Reviews\" called the book \"limp with romantic despair and frayed cynicism making the experience of dislocation and the concentration camps more acceptable to an audience which has avoided it before... Remarque's old following will find that it has a certain urgency without perhaps pausing to wonder whether it is as real as it is readable.\" Charles Poore wrote in his review for \"The Times\"; \"It is a brilliant novel and a strange one, not completely successful but hauntingly moving.\"\n\nWith an expected release during October, 2020, a film based on \"The Night in Lisbon\" is being produced. Ian Stokell is the author of the screenplay.\n"}

It is also called Pakawle by some of the neighboring inhabitants.\n\nIn 1897, Menelik II took over the city.\n\nKonso and its culture were gradually uncovered by Europeans during the XXth century. Father Azaïs presented the Waga (wa'kka) statues in 1931. In 1956, Murdock associated the archeological megaliths of the town to a cushitic signature. In Kluckhohn's \"Markets of Africa\" published in 1962, the author traces high levels of ancient economic developments in the city. In 1984, Amborn studied the historic labor-intensive agricultural techniques of the region.\n\nThe site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on September 30, 1997 due to its purported universal cultural significance and official made a World Heritage Site in 2011.

He became well known in 1944 through his series of paintings depicting some of the great famines in Bengal during its British colonial period. After the Partition of Indian subcontinent he moved to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In 1948, he helped to establish the Institute of Arts and Crafts (now Faculty of Fine Arts) at University of Dhaka. The Indian Express has described him as a legendary Bangladeshi painter. Like many of his contemporaries, his paintings on the Bengal famine of 1943 are viewed as his most characteristic works. His homeland honored him with given the title “Shilpacharjo” () “Great teacher of the arts\" for his artistic and visionary attributes. He was the pioneer of the modern art movement that took place in Bangladesh and was rightly considered by Syed Manzoorul Islam as the founding father of Bangladeshi modern arts, soon after Bangladesh earned the status of an independent republic.\n\nAbedin was born in Kishoreganj on 29 December 1914. Much of his childhood was spent near the scenic banks of the Brahmaputra River. The Brahmaputra would later appear in many of his paintings and be a source of inspiration all throughout his career. Many of his works framed \"Brahmaputra\" and a series of watercolors that Abedin did as his tribute to the river earned him the Governor's Gold Medal in an all-India exhibition in 1938. This was the first time when he came under spotlight and this award gave Abedin the confidence to create his own visual style.\n\nIn 1933, Abedin was admitted to the Government School of Art in Calcutta (now Government College of Art & Craft, Kolkata, India). Here for five years he learned British/ European academic style and later he joined the faculty of the same school after his graduation. He was the first Muslim student to obtain first class distinction from the school. He was dissatisfied with the oriental style and the limitations of European academic style and this led him towards realism. In 1948, with help from a few colleagues, he founded an art institute in Dhaka. Back then, there were no art institutes in the city. Soon after, it went on to be considered the best art institute in Pakistan during its early years. He worked in the Pakistani government for a while. He taught at the institute and among his students was Pakistani artist Mansur Rahi. He also taught Bangladeshi artists such as Monirul Islam and Mohammad Kibria.\n\nAfter completing his two years of training from Slade School of Art in London, he began a new style, the 'Bengali style', where the main features were: folk forms with their geometric shapes, sometimes semi-abstract representation, and the use of primary colors. But he lacked the sense of perspective. Later he realized the limitations of folk art, so he went back to the nature, rural life and the daily struggles of man to make art that would be realistic but modern in appearance.\n\nAmong all the contemporary works of Abedin, his famine sketches of the 1940s are his most remarkable works. His famine painting set which, exhibited in 1944, brought him even more critical acclaim. The miserable situation of the starving people during the Great Famine of Bengal in 1943 touched his heart. He made his own ink by burning charcoal and used it on cheap, ordinary packing paper. He depicted those starving people who were dying by the road-side. Abedin not only documented the famine, he also revealed the famine's sinister face through the skeletal figures of people fated to die of starvation.\nAbedin depicted this inhuman story with very human emotions. These drawings became iconic images of human suffering. These sketches helped him find his way in a realistic approach that focused on the human suffering, struggle and protest. He was more socially aware focusing on the working class and their struggles. The Rebel Cow marks a high point of that style. This particular brand of realism combines social inquiry and the protest with higher aesthetics. He was an influential member of the Calcutta Group of progressive artists and was friends with Shahid Suhrawardy and Ahmed Ali of the Progressive Writers' Movement. He made modernist paintings of Santhal people. Notable among them is \"Two Santhal Women\".\n\nHe visited Palestinian camps in Syria and Jordan in 1970 and made 60–70 paintings of the refugees there. He also painted the 1970 Bhola cyclone that devastated East Pakistan.\n\nHe was involved in the Bengali Language Movement of East Pakistan. Abedin was involved in the Bangladesh liberation war movement. He was at the forefront of the cultural movement to re-establish the Bengali identity, marginalized by the Pakistan government. In 1969, Abedin painted a scroll using Chinese ink, watercolor and wax named Nabanna. This was to celebrate the ongoing non-cooperation movement.\n\nIn 1974 he received Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of Delhi, India. In 1975, he founded the Folk Art Museum at Sonargaon in Narayanganj, and Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala, a gallery of his own works in Mymensingh. In 1982, 17 of the 70 pictures housed in Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala were stolen. Only 10 were later recovered. His famous painting \"Study of a Crow\" (Ink Wash) in the collection of Professor Ahmed Ali is listed in the book \"Arts in Pakistan\" by Jalaluddin Ahmed, 1952, including an exclusive monologue on him published by FOMMA, Karachi, along with his many Famine Series paintings of 1943.\n\nAbedin was married to Jahanara Abedin. He developed lung cancer and died on 28 May 1976 in Dhaka. \"Two faces\" was his last painting, completed shortly before his death. He was buried beside the Dhaka University Central Mosque.\n\nIn 2009, a crater on the planet Mercury was named Abedin after the painter. His birthday was celebrated in Bangladesh, with a festival in Dhaka University and children's art competition in Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala (art gallery). His sketch was auctioned at auction house Bonhams. Zainul Abedin Museum in Mymensingh, Bangladesh is dedicated to his work.\n\nOn December 29, 2019, Google celebrated his 105th birthday with a Google Doodle.\n\n"}

An alternative name for this town is Obda, which is also the name of a nearby mountain. Located northwest of Moyale in the Borena Zone of the Oromia Region (or \"kilil\"), this town has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation of 1857 meters above sea level. It has been the administrative center of the Borena Zone since its division from Guji Zone in September 2002, as well as Yabelo woreda.\n\nThis town is reported to have two gas stations, telephone service, a post office and a commercial bank, as well as at least one primary and one secondary school.\n\nYabelo was entered by the Italian Laghi Division on 11 July 1936, but more formally occupied on 6 August 1936 by troops under the command of Giorgio Pollera. 15 tanks from the Yabelo garrison attempted to break through the Allied defenses around Mega, but failed; Yabelo was occupied by the Allies two days after the armored assault on 22 February 1941. The hangar the Italians had built at Yabelo was dismantled in 1952, and transported to Debre Zeyit by air, where it was re-erected to house the newly acquired Fairey Firefly airplanes from Canada.\n\nThe Norwegian Lutheran Mission started a missionary station at Yabelo in 1950, although the staff was reported to have made little headway in converting the locals, similar to the other Christian missionaries. In 1992, Yabelo was the site of a feeding station to combat a local famine. Conditions had grown so severe that the local Borena Oromo decided to eliminate competition from their neighbors the Gabbra. The Gabbra were killed, their livestock was stolen, and the survivors were moved from the area by CARE. In June 2004, a Rally of Pastoral Clans was held under the acacia trees of the SARDU compound in Yabelo, which included representatives from the Borena, Guji, Gabbra, Arsi and Marian clans in Dire, Liben and Moyale woredas; other attendees included government officials such as Obbo Kibre Jimmera, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Pastoralist Affairs Standing Committee. Economic and social issues were discussed, with an emphasis of finding areas of agreement rather than discussing specific disputes.\n\nLand clashes in June 2006 between the rival Guji and Borena Oromo clans left about 100 people dead in and around the towns of Yabelo, Arero and Shakiso. According to an aid worker in the area, between 37,000 and 39,000 people had fled from the environs of Yabelo.\nCurrently one of the Borana clan called Wayu Oromo/Wayu Bano stated themselves to Oromia Regional state as some unawaredly Borana clan previously hindering them from many development activities in which the Derg regime computed to divide and rule system. But currently in 2014 the struggle continued not to be biased once the government of Ethiopia stated human right. This is through peaceful way actions with government strategy/policies and almost all locations where Wayu clan live in Ethiopians participated on this issue. The goal of this issue is only equality.\n\nRights activists in southern Oromia reported to Human Rights Watch that students, farmers, and businesspeople had been detained in Yabello. As of January 25, 2010 over 150 people, mostly affiliated with the Oromo People's Congress, were said to be still incarcerated in Yabello jail. These arrests reportedly were in response to protests about the activities of mining companies in the region, which the authorities attributed to the opposition.\n\nThe water supply for the town comes from a borehole constructed in 1986, a few miles out of the town. This borehole was designed to accommodate the population of the time, which was reported to be 15,000; however, by 1996 the population had grown much larger and was estimated at 35,000. In addition, it was reported that of the two boreholes only one was functional, and the town had 7 water points at different locations. To alleviate the problem of perennial shortages and improve the provision of water, it was proposed to construct additional boreholes the following year. Yabelo is also near the Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary, known as a habitat of rare birds, including the endemic Stresemann's bushcrow and white-tailed swallow, as well as Swayne's hartebeest.\n\nBased on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Yabelo has an estimated total population of 18,478 of whom 9,551 are men and 8,927 are women. The 1994 national census reported this town had a total population of 10,322 of whom 5,180 were men and 5,142 were women.\n"}

The administrative center of the Gedeo Zone in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR), it is located on the main road from Addis Ababa to Nairobi. The town has a longitude and latitude of , with an elevation of 1570 meters above sea level. It was part of Wenago woreda and is currently surrounded by Dila Zuria woreda.\n\nUntil the completion in the early 1970s of the tarmac road to the Kenya border, Dilla had been located at the southern end of the all-weather road from Addis Ababa and thus became the major transfer and marketing point for coffee grown farther south, particularly of the much-prized Yirga Cheffe varietal (see coffee varietals). It remains a major center of the coffee trade.\n\nAccording to the SNNPR's Bureau of Finance and Economic Development, Dilla's amenities include digital telephone access, postal service, 24-hour electrical service, numerous banks, and a hospital. Dilla is the site of the Dilla College of Teachers' Education, which was founded in 1996 and was part of Debub University. The college become a full flagged University since 2007 and composed of more than 30 programs to Masters and bachelor's degree. A number of archeologically significant stelae fields are in the surrounding area, the most notable groups being those at Tutu Fella and Tutiti.\n\nAround 1930, groups of Guji Oromo migrated into the area, and by the time a German ethnological expedition arrived, they had begun the process of becoming settled farmers. Shortly after the capture of Shashemene in May 1941, a mobile force, consisting of one company of the Natal Mounted Rifles and the 6th KAR, with light tanks and armoured cars, moved forward towards Dilla. Almost to its own surprise, this scouting operation cut off the retreat of the 21st and 24th Italian Divisions, pinning them against the east side of Lake Abaya.\n\nBy 1958 Dilla was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. The Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia carried out surveys for extending the railway with a 310 km line from Adama to Dilla between 1960 and 1963. The government formed a Nazareth-Dilla Railway Development Corporation to support this new branch. Although the French government offered a loan to fund this new branch in 1965, and Yugoslav experts had studied and thought the project would be worthwhile, this project was never carried out.\n\nOutside Dilla is Michille (ሚችሌ) hill, where a peasant uprising by the Gedeo people was crushed in 1960. Gedeo elders, invited by \"Afanegus\" Eshate Gada to meet him and discuss their grievances with the feudal system they lived under, were ambushed and slaughtered by the army.\n\nOn 22 July 1998 there were violent clashes near Dila. The press published conflicting statements about who the parties were and how many had been killed. Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse said that about 140 people were killed and large numbers at least temporarily displaced.\n\nOn October 12, 2008, Bekele Girma, an All Ethiopian Unity Party (AEUP) activist, left AEUP's head office in Addis Ababa to open an office in Dila. Despite having a letter from the National Election Board of Ethiopia requesting regional government officials to assist him in opening a local office, Dilla police chief Obsa Hundessa detained Bekele and refused to allow him to open an office in that town. Bekele was released in November.\n\nBased on the 2007 Census conducted by the CSA, this town has a total population of 59,150, of whom 31,068 are men and 28,082 women.

{"id": "2168428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168428", "title": "Riviera Country Club", "text": "Riviera Country Club\n\nThe Riviera Country Club is an exclusive private club with a championship golf course in the western United States, located in southern California in Pacific Palisades, a community within the city limits of Los Angeles. It's in Santa Monica Canyon, just below the Santa Monica Mountains and a block south of Sunset Boulevard. Designed by golf course architects George C. Thomas, Jr. and William P. Bell, it has been the primary host for the Genesis Invitational (originally the Los Angeles Open), an annual event on the PGA Tour in February. The 2020 edition was the 57th held at Riviera.\n\nRiviera has also hosted three major championships: the U.S. Open in 1948, and the PGA Championship in 1983 and 1995. In addition, it was site of the U.S. Senior Open, a senior major, in 1998 and the U.S. Amateur in August 2017. The club is scheduled to host the Olympics in 2028.\n\nWhen the country club and course opened in 1926, it was known as the Los Angeles Athletic Club Golf Course. William P. Bell helped Thomas in the design and planning of the course. They were in charge of assembling a labor force to build the course from scratch in the Santa Monica Canyon. The entire country club and golf course cost $243,827 to build; at the time, it was one of the most expensive in golf history. The course has been modified a few times, most notably in 1992 when Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore redesigned the bunkers to look as they did when the course opened.\n\nThe country club prospered in the 1930s. It hosted the dressage equestrian and the riding part of the modern pentathlon events for the 1932 Summer Olympics. The Riviera Equestrian Center was where prominent riders like Egan Merz trained younger people like Elizabeth Taylor how to ride; Taylor, then a child star, was preparing for her role in the 1944 movie \"National Velvet\".\n\nThe 1952 movie \"Pat and Mike\", starring Katharine Hepburn and Babe Zaharias, was filmed at Riviera, as was \"The Caddy\", starring Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, with a cameo appearance by Ben Hogan, and \"Follow the Sun\", about Hogan, starring Glenn Ford and Anne Baxter. During the silent era, the 1927 movie \"Spring Fever\" was filmed at the new club, in which it was called Oakmont Country Club.\n\nRiviera has had many famous members, which included Humphrey Bogart, Glen Campbell, Vic Damone, Peter Falk, Jack Ging, Dean Martin, Gregory Peck, Walt Disney, Hal Roach, Douglas Fairbanks, and Mary Pickford. The actor Conrad Veidt died suddenly of a heart attack in 1943 while playing golf at the club. \n\nWillie Hunter, the 1921 British Amateur champion and six-time PGA Tour winner, served as the head professional from 1936 to 1964. His son, Mac Hunter, was head pro from 1964 to 1973. Willie Hunter helped save the course from severe flooding in 1939, and helped rescue the club from bankruptcy during World War II. \n\nRiviera hosted the Los Angeles Open in 1929 and 1930, then nine consecutive years from 1945 through 1953. It returned where it has remained, with the exception of 1983 and 1998, for a total of 75 times through 2020.\n\nThe course is well known for Ben Hogan, and the course has been called \"Hogan's Alley\" (a moniker shared with Colonial Country Club in Texas). Hogan won the L.A. Open three times (1942, 1947, 1948), finished second once (1946), and won the U.S. Open in 1948; all were at Riviera except the 1942 event (at Hillcrest). Other notable winners at Riviera include Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Hale Irwin, Tom Watson, Johnny Miller, Ben Crenshaw, Bubba Watson, Mark Calcavecchia, Fred Couples, Corey Pavin, Craig Stadler, Nick Faldo, Ernie Els, Mike Weir, and Phil Mickelson. Hal Sutton won the PGA Championship in August 1983, and Steve Elkington in 1995. More than 22 years after his win in 1976, Irwin won the U.S. Senior Open at Riviera in July 1998.\n\nMore recent winners at Riviera include Rory Sabbatini in 2006, and Charles Howell III, who won in 2007 in a sudden-death playoff against Phil Mickelson. In 2008, the first as the Northern Trust Open, Mickelson hung on for a two-shot win over Jeff Quinney to win for the first time at Riviera. This win gave Mickelson at least one win in every West Coast Swing event.\n\nNotable exceptions to the list of winners are Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Nicklaus' best finish in the L.A. Open was at age 38 in 1978, two strokes back as solo runner-up after an uncharacteristic stumble late in the final round. Five years later at the PGA Championship, he was one stroke behind champion Sutton.\n\nAs a high school sophomore from Cypress in neighboring Orange County, Woods played his very first PGA Tour event, on a sponsor's exemption (as an amateur) at Riviera in 1992; he shot 72–75 and missed the cut by six strokes. His best finish at L.A. was in 1998, when the Nissan Open was held at the Valencia Country Club (Riviera was being prepared for the U.S. Senior Open). Woods shot 65–66 on the weekend, but lost in a playoff to Billy Mayfair, one of only two playoff losses on tour (15–2 through February 2014). Woods finished tied for second in 1999 and had top-10 finishes in 2003 and 2004. The 2005 event had only two rounds due to rain; Woods finished 13th. He played at Riviera in 2006, also rain-plagued, but withdrew after two rounds due to illness, missed the next eleven editions, then returned in 2018 \n\nBolded years are major championships on the PGA Tour.\n\nThe greens at Riviera are \"Poa annua\", common for the West, but the fairways and rough are Kikuyu grass. A tough, dense pasture grass originally from East Africa, it had been used at a nearby polo field in the 1930s and was also planted on hillsides to prevent erosion. Over the years, it gradually invaded the course and became the dominant species. Kikuyu provides optimal lies on close-mown fairways, but is very challenging in the spongy rough.\n\nGuests at Riviera must play the course with a member. For the dress code, denim is not allowed; a collared shirt and either Bermuda shorts or slacks are required.\n\nThe course is a par 71, at a length of from the back tees (which has been lengthened to for Tour play), from the middle tees, and from the forward tees. The men's slope ratings are 74.6/135 and 72.2/130 for the back and middle tees, respectively. The ladies' slope rating is 74.3/142 for the forward tees.\n\nThe course record for competitive play is 61, ten under par, shot by Ted Tryba in 1999 in the third round of the Nissan Open, and included a bogey on 18. Tryba was the runner-up that year to Ernie Els. The course record for the lowest nine holes is 28 (seven under par on the front nine), shot by Andrew Magee in the opening round in 1991 (followed by a 38 on the back nine for a 66). He finished the tournament four strokes back, tied for eighth.\n\nThe first hole, a short Par-5, is an easy beginning hole. The tee is elevated above the fairway, tempting players to hit driver but out of bounds on the left side and a barranca crossing the fairway make players cautious. Scores range from eagle to double bogey. The second hole is a long par four that plays uphill and into the wind. It's the number one handicap hole. The third hole is a medium-length Par-4 that also plays into a breeze.\n\nThe fourth hole is a very long Par-3, which Hogan called the \"best par three in America.\" The par four fifth hole plays into the wind and is almost on the side of the hill. The par three sixth hole is world-famous for having a bunker in the middle of the green. If a player is on the wrong side of the green, they will have to make a tough decision to either putt around or chip over the bunker.\n\nThe narrow fairway at the seventh hole, a par four, is difficult to hit. The eighth hole, a long par four, has two fairways separated by a dry ditch. The ninth, a long, uphill Par-4, is known for its well-placed fairway bunkers.\n\nThe tenth hole is a very short, 315 yard Par-4 known as a risk-reward hole. Longer hitters can try to drive the green but an accurate drive will be needed since several bunkers surround the green. The 11th hole is a long Par-5 where eucalyptus trees and a barranca come into play. The 12th is a long Par-4, often into the wind, that plays to a narrow green surrounded by the barranca, bunkers and trees. One, Bogey's Tree, is named after Humphrey Bogart.\n\nThe 13th hole is a tough driving hole, with the barranca on the left side and eucalyptus along the right. The 14th is an easy Par-3 with the largest green on the golf course but the green is multi-tiered, which makes putting difficult. The 15th hole is a dogleg Par-4 to the right that features another large green but it's two-tiered so golfers must make sure their ball is on the proper tier. This hole plays into the breeze of the Pacific Ocean so it's a pivotal hole in the tournament.\n\nThe 16th hole is the last Par-3 on the course and can yield birdies, however players will need to hit the small green that is surrounded by bunkers. The 17th hole is a long, uphill Par-5 that is the longest hole on the course. The final 18th hole is a world-famous Par-4. The tee shot is blind and the ball must find the fairway to have any chance of reaching the green, which is surrounded by a natural amphitheater with a beautiful view of the clubhouse.\n\n"}

His party was called Hezb-i-Islami (\"Party of Islam\"), the same as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's party. The two are commonly differentiated as Hezb-e Islami Khalis and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin.\n\nHaving introduced the radical Islamist thinker Sayyid Qutb in Afghanistan by translating his book \"Social Justice in Islam\" into Dari in the 50s, he was a staunch conservative fundamentalist and virulently anti-Shia, though not—unlike Gulbadin Hekmatyar, his original commander with whom he severed his ties for being too extreme—a hardliner, and wrote the 1991 treatise \"An Appeal to Support the Holy War in the Sudan\". After the fall of the communist government in 1992, his forces controlled Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nBelonging to the Khugiani tribe of Pashtuns, Maulvi Mohammad Yunus Khalis was born in 1919 in Khogyani District, Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan and became a powerful figure in his country’s turbulent modern history. Educated in Islamic law and theology at the Darul Uloom Haqqania in Pakistan, Khalis exercised influence through his conservative vision of Islamic society. Sometimes referred to as the don of Nangarhar, he was also a shrewd politician who wielded considerable power behind the scenes during one of the most turbulent and violent periods in his country’s history.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Mohammad Zahir Shah by Mohammad Daoud in 1973, Khalis fled to Pakistan and joined Hekmatyar's Islamic Party (Hezb-e Islami). After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Khalis broke with Hekmatyar and established his own party (Hezb-e Islami Khalis).\n\nKhalis reportedly entered Afghanistan many times to join his forces in waging war against the Soviets and their local proxies. Many prominent mujahideen commanders including Abdul Haq, Amin Wardak Faisal Babakarkhail and Jalaluddin Haqqani were affiliated with Hezb-e-Islami Khalis.\n\nAfter the fall of the Communist regime in 1992, Khalis participated in the Islamic Interim Government. He was a member of the Leadership Council (Shura-ye Qiyaadi), but held no other official post. Instead of moving to Kabul, he chose to remain in Nangarhar. His party controlled major parts of this politically and strategically important province. The Taliban brought Nangarhar under their control in September 1996 and Khalis was supportive of the Taliban movement and had a close relationship with Taliban commanders. \n\nKhalis resided in Pakistan in the late 1990s. After the fall of the Taliban, his supporters regained their stronghold in Jalalabad where Khalis exerted considerable influence, although he held no official post. Two of his close associates, Haji Abdul Qadir and Haji Din Mohammad served as governors of Nangarhar Province after the fall of the Communist regime.\n\nAccording to a statement from his son Anwar ul Haq Mujahid, leader of the insurgent group Tora Bora Military Front, Khalis died on 19 July 2006.\n\nThe author of many essays and poetry collections, his publications include:\n"}

He was educated in Zaostrog monastery and Buda. He used to teach philosophy in Zaostrog and Sumartin on Brač.\n\nHis most important work is \"Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog\" (\"Pleasant Conversation of Slavic People\", 1756), a history in verse, in which Kačić Miočić, influenced by the ideals of the Enlightenment, tried to spread literacy and modern ideas among common people. It was the most popular book in the Croatian-speaking lands for more than a century. It also played a key role in the victory of the Shtokavian dialect as the standard Croatian language. It contain poems about Skanderbeg which were basis for tragedy \"Skenderbeg\" written by Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski in the 19th century. They were also basis for \"Život i viteška voevanja slavnog kneza epirskog Đorđa Kastriota Skenderbega\" written by Jovan Sterija Popović in 1828.\n\nUsing the ten-syllable verse of folk poetry and relying on Mavro Orbini and Pavao Ritter Vitezović, Kačić Miošić narrates and sings about the history of the Slavic peoples from the antiquity to his age. He, like Ivan Gundulić, describes the Slavic peoples from the Adriatic to the North Sea as one people. The book exalts many heroes from the famous Croatian families of the age of the Ottoman wars. His most important work also contained a lot of references and praise for the Bosniak nation and its historical events. Since the book includes some important folk poems, many readers considered it a folk songbook.\n\n\"Pleasant Conversation\" is mostly didactic in tone and of little artistic value, but later it served as a valuable source of historic data. It gave inspiration for future Croatian writers.\n\nHis other works are a philosophical study in Latin and a chronicle called \"Korabljica\" (1760), where he used passages from other writers, including Vitezović.\n\n"}

Located in the West Shewa Zone of the Oromia Region, west of Addis Ababa, this town has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation of 2101 meters.\n\nAmbo is known for its mineral water, which is bottled outside of town; it is reportedly the most popular brand in Ethiopia. Nearby attractions include Mount Wenchi to the south with its crater lake, and the Guder and Huluka Falls. Ambo is also the location of a research station of the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research; initiated in 1977, this station hosts research in protecting major crops in Ethiopia. The town's market day is Saturday.\n\nAfter Lij Iyasu was captured, he was held for a while at Ambo, before being transferred to house arrest at Fiche. In the early 1730s, Mahtama Selassie Walda Mesqal, who had studied agriculture in France and Spain, started an agricultural station near the town. By 1933, Ambo had started to be a recreation place with the construction of some bath cabins with cisterns of concrete, and a couple of European-type hotels, as well as simple villas for the Emperor and important persons.\n\nBy 1938, the \"Guida\" described improvements to Ambo which included a post office, telephone service, a clinic for outpatients, restaurants, and a hotel under construction. Two Italian forts were constructed, and in a cave the Italians had erected a monument for casualties of the Pusteria Division. The approach to Ambo was still over an old bridge, and below it a natural bridge used by caravans.\n\nWhen the Allies reached Ambo with a South African armored car patrol in early 1941, they had to evacuate 140 \"utterly panicked Italians\". The British operated an improvised camp for prisoners-of-war at Ambo until 1942.\n\nAt least as early as 1955, there was a 170 kW hydro-electric power station in the town; by 1965 the installed electrical capacity was 210 kVA, with annual production of 132,000 kWh. In 1958 Ambo was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. That same year, the Ambo Agricultural School and Ambo Forestry School had 150 students. A light earth tremor was felt in the evening of 23 January 1968; its epicenter was somewhere near Ambo but no damage occurred.\n\nIn the last weeks of the Ethiopian Civil War, military units of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front captured Ambo on 25 April 1991 from the disintegrating units of the Derg. This was part of their strategy to avoid a direct assault on the capital, Addis Ababa, and instead surround the city and isolate it from the rest of the country.\n\nA prominent Oromo businessman, Daraaraa Kafani, was murdered in front of his home; eyewitnesses said he was slain by a man wearing a military uniform. His funeral was attended by thousands of Oromos in Ambo; police arrested more than 37 people, stating that they were supporters of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) on 3 September. In the following February, 70-year-old Oromo elder Dandana Gurmu was arrested on the accusation that he was a supporter of the OLF.\n\nOn 24 April 2003, a Tigrayan student was shot and killed and two others injured in a clash between Oromo and Tigrayan students at the Ambo Agricultural College. The killing was believed to be retaliation for the severe beating of an Oromo student in Mek'ele in December 2002. By the year's end, five persons were in police custody awaiting trial.\n\nThe 2007 national census reported a total population for Ambo of 48,171, of whom 24,634 were men and 23,537 were women. The majority of the inhabitants said they observed Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 65.18% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 27.45% of the population were Protestant.\n\nThe 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 27,636 of whom 13,380 were males and 14,256 were females.\n\nResidents of the town are usually considered as being \"extreme Oromo Nationalists\" and Pro-OLF.\n\nAmbo Comprehensive Senior Secondary School, with its large library and modern laboratory has been one of the best high schools in the country. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary (Golden Jubilee) in 2006. Prominent alumni include poet Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin and former Ethiopian Prime minister Tesfaye Dinka. Ambo students' movement played notable role in the Ethiopian student movement, particularly during the final years of the feudal regime and the recurring student unrest of the current administration.\n\nAmbo High School absorbs students from surrounding woredas which extends as far as East Wollega Zone. The concentration of young students in the town has been significant contributor for the city's high political consciousness.\n\nThe city is the home of Ambo University.\n\nOn 18 December 2006, the Oromia Region government signed an agreement with Henan in China to establish a sister city program with Xuchang.\n\n\n"}

It was formerly known as Debre Zeyit (Amharic: ደብረ ዘይት) however since the late 1990s it has been officially known by the Oromo name, Bishoftu, which was its name until 1955. \n\nBishoftu is located southeast of Addis Ababa along its route 4 highway.\n\nNearby points of interest include Mount Yerer, Green Crater Lake and Lake Hora Kiloli.\nIt is a resort town, known for five crater lakes: Lake Bishoftu, Lake Hora (a base for watersports, many water birds and an annual festival), Lake Bishoftu Guda, Lake Koriftu and the seasonal Lake Cheleklaka. Bishoftu is also home to the Ethiopian Air Force and the Harar Meda Airport (ICAO HAHM, IATA QHR), as well as a station on the Addis Ababa – Djibouti Railway. It has had telephone service since 1954. The city is home for the National Veterinary Institute of Ethiopia, established in 1963, the leading veterinary vaccine research and production center currently producing more than 20 livestock vaccines. Next door to the national veterinary institute is the scholl of veterinary medicine of Addis Ababa University. The Gafat Armament Engineering Complex is located here. According to the Nordic Africa Institute website, other major businesses in Bishoftu include the Ada Flour and Pasta Factory, the Pasqua Giuseppe PLC, the Salmida Leather Products Manufacturing, Ratson (Women Youth Children Development Programme), and Winrock International Ethiopia. The Debre Zeyt Research Center, founded in 1953, is run by the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, specializing in agricultural research, which includes acting as the national center for research to improve the yield of teff, lentils, chickpeas, and poultry. In 2007 Bishoftu became the new home of Meserete Kristos College, a Christian college owned by the Meserete Kristos Church.\n\nBishoftu, as a definite entity, did not come into existence until after the Second World War. Accounts of earlier travelers call the region \"Adda\", although one Swedish memoir from 1935 mentions a village named \"Bishoftu\"; the future minister Makonnen Habte-Wold was born in this village. At about from Adda, on land that had been owned partly by Emperor Haile Selassie I, the Italians started \"Azienda Agraria di Biscioftu dell'Opera Nazionale per i Combattenti\" on 15,000 hectares, intending to create a center of colonization as well as an experimental agricultural station. The first foundation stone for the houses was laid 9 December 1937, but only 21 dwellings were ready by May 1938. Various administrative and service buildings were also built.\n\nThe history of the Ethiopian Air Force is tightly woven with the history of Bishoftu. In 1946, the beginnings of what would become the Ethiopian Air Force was moved from Lideta airport in Addis Ababa, which was needed by Ethiopian Airlines, to Bishoftu. The initial group of 19 Swedes under Count Carl Gustaf von Rosen, who were to train the pilots and support personal, arrived there after leaving Sweden between 9 January and 16 July 1946. Both Ethiopian cadets and the Swedish instructors took part in constructing the first buildings on the base. Six Saab 91 Safir training airplanes were bought in Sweden and flown to the new airbase 24 December 1946, and on 10 November 1947 a fleet of 16 Saab-built B-17s were landed at Bishoftu by Swedish pilots.\n\nBishoftu Technical High School was established in 1958 with a 5-year course for boys 12–15 years of age. An Evangelical College had been founded two years before, which was a joint undertaking of Swedish, Norwegian, and German Evangelical missions. The Evangelical College's first headmaster was Sven Rubenson. The Animal Health Assistants Training School was established in Bishoftu in 1963, with financial support by the United Nations Special Fund.\n\nThe artist Lemma Tesefa Kesime was born (1956) in Bishoftu. He studied at the Art School 1972-1974 and received his M.A. from the Soviet Union in 1983. Returning to Ethiopia, Lemma Tesefa became a teacher at the art school in Addis Ababa. Bishoftu was also the favored weekend retreat of Emperor Haile Selassie, who built a palace in the town, named \"Fairfield\" after his wartime home in exile in the town of Bath, England.\n\nArmed forces of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front bypassed the capital and occupied Bishoftu in May, 1991, bringing order to the area after the collapse of the Mengistu government, taking control of what remained of the Soviet-supplied Air Force. The airbase was also used to detain several dozen senior military officers after the capture of the capital.\nOn 2 October 2016 at Irreechaa celebration security forces fired tear gas at protesters forcing them to panic and as a result 52 people lost their lives after falling into ditches around Lake Hora.\nOn 10 March 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed near the town of Bishoftu.\n\nThe 2007 national census reported a total population for Bishoftu of 99,928, of whom 47,860 were men and 52,068 were women. The majority of the inhabitants said they practised Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 79.75% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 13.82% of the population were Protestant, and 4.98% of the population were Muslim.\n\nThe 1994 census reported Bishoftu had a total population of 73,372 of whom 35,058 were men and 38,314 were women. The three largest ethnic groups reported for this town were the Amhara (42.86%), the Oromo (39.4%), and the Gurage (8.3%); all other ethnic groups made up 9.44% of the population. Amharic is spoken as a first language by 71.95%, and 20.12% spoke Oromiffa; the remaining 7.93% spoke all other primary languages reported. Concerning religious beliefs, 87.87% of the population said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 6.93% were Protestants, and 4.02% observed Roman Catholicism.\n\n"}

Richard Pankhurst notes that during this period Dembidolo was \"a great commercial centre for coffee, where by the 1930's perhaps 500,000 kilos of beans, besides large quantities of wax and skins, were exported every year to the Sudan.\" Emperor Iyasu V visited Dembidolo around 1912, and was welcomed by Dejazmach Jote.\n\nBy 1958 Dembi Dollo became one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township.

Afterwards, the OLF assumed civilian control of Dembi Dollo and its surrounding territory. However, when the OLF found that their efforts to field candidates in the rest of the Oromia region were frustrated by the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization the OLF withdrew from the government in 1992.

He founded the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) and was an emeritus professor at Université de Montréal and a professor at McGill University . Genest was best known for founding and leading several organizations related to clinical research in Québec and for his work on arterial hypertension.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Genest received his medical degree from the University of Montreal. He completed his residency in internal medicine and pathology at the Hôpital Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal before heading to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland for a research fellowship. He was then a research associate and assistant physician at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, which later awarded him an honorary degree in 1986.\n\nUpon returning to Quebec, he was asked by the provincial government to perform a study of the state of research in the province. Following his visits to major universities and research institutions of the United States and Europe, he concluded that Québec lagged behind in this sector. He therefore founded the first department of clinical research at Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal in 1952. Though he had the confidence on the administration, this move was poorly received by his colleagues, who disapproved of a physician being salaried and freed from clinical tasks to devote himself to the study of hypertension. However, the lack of financing and of laboratory space complicated the growth of the department. In 1955 the department was recognized by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada for basic science training, leading to an improvement in his colleagues' opinions. The department became the only place offering both clinical and research education for physicians. Jacques Genest acceded to the presidency of the medical council of Hôtel-Dieu in 1958. Furthermore, he created the Club de Recherches Cliniques du Québec (CRCQ), a place for discourse between francophone researchers.\n\nNow more firmly established, the department recruited dozens of researchers between 1952 and 1967. The department established close ties with J.S.L. Browne, director of the department of Investigative Medicine at McGill University, who offered interns the opportunity to round out their clinical studies with a solid theoretical foundation. In 1964, Jacques Genest was named director of the Department of Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Montréal. He continued at the same time to work towards the elaboration of a council of medical research in Québec which would permit governmental finance of research. Indeed, today the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec (FRSQ) awards scholarships and grants to researchers in the health sciences. Also in 1964, McGill offered Genest the post of Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. This position offered him support sufficient to lay the cornerstone for a research institute. With the help of noted lawyer Marcel Piché, they founded the Claude Bernard Medical Center, which is known today as the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM). The provincial minister of health Alphonse Couturier allocated critical funds towards the foundation of this institution. Genest guided this foundation from 1967 through 1984. He also contributed to the establishment of a center for the study of bioethics within the IRCM.\n\nHe died on 5 January 2018 at the age of 98.\n\nHis interests in arterial hypertension led him to uncover the role of sodium, aldosterone, and angiotensin II in the renin-angiotensin system. He established tests for renin activity in plasma, which were important for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension and as a predictor of the efficacy of surgical intervention. Additionally, he worked on the natriuretic factor present in heart atria.\n\n\n"}

Lotti rose to fame in the skateboarding world in the late 1980s while riding for H-Street Skateboards. He is known for his fluid skateboarding style and inventing the \"Bigspin\" skateboard trick.\n\nLotti's popularity peaked in the early 1990s while he was sponsored by skateboard company Planet Earth and appeared in the 1991 Planet Earth video \"Now N' Later\". After moving on to ride for Blind Skateboards, Lotti left the world of professional skateboarding and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nFollowing his return to the skateboarding industry, Lotti completed filming a part in the 2007 Santa Cruz Skateboards \"Legends\" video. In 2009 Lotti founded his own company, Telegraph Skateboards, and all of the skateboard decks featured original design work by Lotti and his associates. However, as of March 2014, the brand is no longer operational—its web-site is nonexistent and its products are no longer sold.\n\nAs one of the originators of today's technical street-skating, Lotti brought several tricks to the forefront of skateboarding such as the frontside bluntside. He also invented the backside tailslide flip-out and the Bigspin. The Bigspin was done by skateboarders before Lotti but the catchy name caught on. The name was derived from a Californian lottery at the time with the name Bigspin. The person who named the trick the Bigspin saw Lotti do one and chose the name because his last name sounds like the word lottery.\n\nFollowing his initial departure from professional skateboarding, Lotti became an attendant for Roshi Robert Aiken at the Palolo Valley sangha. There he studied Buddhism and went on to further his education at the University of Hawaii. Lotti then moved back to the mainland and attended California State University at San Francisco, where he graduated with a degree in art.\n\nFollowing university, Lotti moved to Northern California to concentrate on his art career. After a few years of living on the San Juan Ridge, he moved to Los Angeles. Lotti has designed board graphics for skateboard companies and brands, such as Cartel, Cliche, Listen, Stereo, Death Skateboards, Almost, and the now-defunct Adio Skateboards.\n\nIn early 2016, Lotti participated in \"The Art of a Political Revolution,\" an event in Los Angeles which showcased art that supported the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. Lotti designed new cover artwork for the 10-year anniversary reissue of Midlake's album \"The Trials of Van Occupanther\".\n\nIn September 2018, Lotti collaborated with Adidas Skateboarding to reissue the brand's Campus 80s sneakers with his label and apparel.\n\nLotti's most recent appearance in the skateboarding world has been as the director of a film called \"1st and Hope\" about a day devoted to skateboarding in the streets of downtown Los Angeles.

{"id": "2168500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168500", "title": "Patristics", "text": "Patristics\n\nPatristics or patrology is the study of the early Christian writers who are designated Church Fathers. The names derive from the combined forms of Latin \"pater\" and Greek \"patḗr\" (father). The period is generally considered to run from the end of New Testament times or end of the Apostolic Age () to either AD 451 (the date of the Council of Chalcedon) or to the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.\n\nAmong those whose writings form the basis for patristics, (i.e., prominent early Church Fathers), are:\n\n\nMajor focuses for these theologians during the period are in chronological order: Christianity's relationship with Judaism; the establishment of the New Testament canon; apologetics (the 'defense' or 'explanation' of Christianity); and doctrinal discussions that sought to achieve consistency of faith, in particular within the Christianised Roman Empire. Following the scholar of Christianity Alister McGrath (1998), several major areas of theology can be seen to have developed during the Patristic Period: the extent of the New Testament canon, the role of tradition, the fixing of the ecumenical creeds, the two natures of Christ, the doctrine of the Trinity, the doctrine of the Church, and the doctrine of divine grace.\n\nThe church fathers are generally divided into the Ante-Nicene Fathers, those who lived and wrote before the Council of Nicaea (325) and the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, those who lived and wrote after 325. Also, the division of the fathers into Greek and Latin writers is also common. Some of the most prominent Greek Fathers are Justin Martyr, Athanasius of Alexandria, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, John Chrysostom, Cyril of Alexandria, and Maximus the Confessor. Among the Latin Fathers are Tertullian, Cyprian, Jerome, Ambrose of Milan, Augustine of Hippo, and Gregory the Great.\n\nThere were also church fathers who wrote in languages other than Greek or Latin, such as Coptic, Syriac, Ge'ez, and Armenian, among others. Historically, Chalcedonian Christians have had less interest in these authors since the associated churches ended up rejecting the councils of Chalcedon (becoming Oriental Orthodox), or Ephesus (becoming the Church of the East). Recently this has begun to change, with the cooling of tensions between these branches of Christianity and the Western and Byzantine ones. There are Eastern Catholics who follow Oriental rites while remaining in communion with Rome, and at least one organization argues that Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christians now share the same faith.\n\nThe major locations of the early Church fathers were Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and the area of western north Africa around Carthage. Milan and Jerusalem were also sites.\n\nAlister McGrath notes four reasons why understanding patristics can be difficult in the early 21st-century:\n\nThe terms neo-patristics and post-patristics refer to recent theologies according to which the Church Fathers must be reinterpreted or even critically tested in light of modern developments since their writings reflected that of a distant past. These theologies, however, are considered controversial or even dangerous by orthodox theologians.\n\nSome scholars, chiefly in Germany, distinguish patrologia from patristica. Josef Fessler, for instance, defines patrologia as the science which provides all that is necessary for the using of the works of the Fathers, dealing, therefore, with their authority, the criteria for judging their genuineness, the difficulties to be met within them, and the rules for their use. But Fessler's own \"Institutiones Patrologiae\" has a larger range, as have similar works entitled Patrologies, for example, that of Otto Bardenhewer (tr. Shahan, Freiburg, 1908). Catholic writer Karl Keating argues that patrology is the study of the Early Fathers and their contemporaries as people, and the authenticity of the works attributed to them. Patristics, on the other hand, is the study of their thought.\n\nOn the other hand, Fessler describes patristica as that theological science by which all that concerns faith, morals, or discipline in the writings of the Fathers is collected and sorted. The lives and works of the Fathers are also described by a non-specialized science: literary history. These distinctions are not much observed, nor do they seem very necessary; they are nothing else than aspects of patristic study as it forms part of fundamental theology, of positive theology, and of literary history.\n\nMost patristic texts are available in their original languages in Jacques Paul Migne's two great patrologies, \"Patrologia Latina\" and \"Patrologia Graeca\". For Syriac and other Eastern languages the \"Patrologia Orientalis\" (\"Patrologia Syriaca\" earlier) is less complete and can be largely supplemented by the \"Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium\".

It was established in 1993 after an intensive campaign by Canadian and American conservation organizations to halt mining exploration and development in the area, and protect the area for its strong natural heritage and biodiversity values.\n\nThe park is situated in the very northwestern corner of British Columbia, bordering the American state of Alaska and the Canadian Yukon Territory. It nestles between Kluane National Park and Reserve in the Yukon and Glacier Bay & Wrangell–St. Elias National Parks and Preserves in Alaska. It is part of the Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek park system, and in 1994 was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nOver the centuries, numerous indigenous peoples lived in this area, including the historic Tlingit and Southern Tutchone, who built fishing villages along the rivers. The eastern edge of the park follows an ancient trade route used by the Chilkat (a Tlingit people) to barter with the Tutchone.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the sudden breakup of a natural dam on the Alsek River caused a severe flood. The dam had been formed by the advance of a glacier across the entire Alsek River channel; the obstructed river formed a large temporary lake upstream of the blockage. A wall of water  high and  wide swept an entire Tutchone village into the sea at Dry Bay, killing all the inhabitants.\n\nTatshenshini-Alsek was one of the last areas of British Columbia to be mapped and explored. In the 1960s the first geological exploration for minerals took place in the area. Significant copper deposits were found in the vicinity of Windy Craggy Mountain, in the middle of the Tatshenshini region. In the mid-1970s two companies began rafting the Tatshenshini (aka \"the Tat\", a term also used to refer to the region) and Alsek rivers for the first time. In the mid-1980s a proposal surfaced to develop Windy Craggy peak into a huge open-pit mine.\n\nIn 1991 Tatshenshini International was established, linking together the top 50 conservation organisations in North America. An extremely intensive campaign followed in Canada and in the United States, particularly the U.S. Congress and eventually the White House, when the active involvement of then Vice-President Al Gore was enlisted. Eventually, BC Premier Mike Harcourt responded by undertaking a review of the issues surrounding Tatshenshini-Alsek by the Commission on Resources and the Environment (CORE). BC government under Premier Harcourt decided in June 1993 to protect Tatshenshini-Alsek as a Class A park. The owners of the Windy-Craggy mineral claims were given a $103.8 million settlement.\n\nIn combination with the adjoining national parks, this completed protection of the world's largest international park complex. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) proposed the area for protection as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek transfrontalier park system comprising Kluane, Wrangell-St Elias, Glacier Bay and Tatshenshini-Alsek parks, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 for the spectacular glacier and icefield landscapes, in addition to the importance of its habitat for grizzly bears, caribou and Dall sheep.\n\nIn 1999, a party of sheep hunters found artifacts and remains of a young male at the foot of a glacier in the park; he was later called Kwäday Dän Ts’ìnchi, or \"Long Ago Man Found\". The well-preserved frozen body turned out to be between 300 and 550 years old. Representatives of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations were consulted for this find on their historic territory, and they named the young man. In addition, they agreed to scientific and DNA testing of the remains. Researchers recruited volunteers to see if people could be found who were genetically related to the \"iceman\". Some 241 volunteers were tested from the area Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, and related peoples in Yukon, British Columbia and Alaska. Seventeen living relatives, including two sisters, were found in the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations who are related through a mitochondrial DNA match of the direct female line. Fifteen of these 17 identify as Wolf clan, suggesting the young man also belonged to that clan. In the matrilineal kinship system, children are considered born into their mother's clan, and descent is figured through the mother's line.\n\nThe Alsek and Tatshenshini rivers flow through the park in glacier-carved U-shaped valleys. These valleys through the coastal mountains allow cool, moist ocean air into the cold interior. The quick change from ocean to interior environment, frequent floods, landslides and avalanches, a varied geology and great elevation changes have together created an exceptionally diverse range of habitat conditions.\n\nTatshenshini-Alsek Park supports a large grizzly bear population. A green area that cuts through a barrier of mountain and ice connects coastal and interior grizzly bear populations and provides a perfect habitat. The park is the only Canadian home of the glacier bear. This extremely rare blue-grey colour phase of the black bear is found only within the park and just over the border into the United States.\n\nAs well as bears, Tatshenshini-Alsek Park also supports Dall's sheep, and exceptional numbers of mountain goats, Kenai moose, grey wolves, eagles (bald and golden), falcons (peregrine and gyr), and trumpeter swans.\n\nAlong the coastline, sea lions and humpback whales can be seen.\n\nAlsek Ranges are situated there and Mount Fairweather, at is the province's highest peak. The Tatshenshini-Alsek area lies in a region of high earthquake activity. Slippages along the Fairweather and Hubbard/Border Faults to the west and the Denali Fault to the north cause regular quakes.\n\n\n"}

It currently includes all of Cleveland, Gaston, Lincoln, Polk, and Rutherford counties, and part of Catawba, Iredell, and Buncombe counties.\n\nRepublicans have won the district continuously since 1969. Republican Patrick McHenry has represented the district since 2005. Jeff Gregory (D) was defeated in the 2010 election to represent this district. The 10th district was part of the controversial statewide redistricting by the Republican-led state legislature in 2011. The district's northwest border was redrawn to include most of heavily Democratic Asheville, long the heart of the 11th District. At the same time, some heavily Republican areas in the 10th were shifted to the 11th. While this made the 10th approximately seven points more Democratic, it was not nearly enough to overcome the heavy Republican tilt in the western Charlotte suburbs.\n\n\n\n"}

The sixth chapter of it is named after her. She is also known as the Safflower Princess. In some English translations she appears as Princess Hitachi. Prince Genji was briefly attracted to her, until she lowered her fan to reveal her nose. However, he eventually felt sorry for her and helped support her.\n\nThe incident with the Safflower Princess's nose has always been a source of comic relief for readers of the \"Tale of Genji\". In the \"manga\" comics, the extremely shy princess is always depicted as being quite unattractive, the amorous prince having fallen in love first because of her voice and the way she plays the \"koto\". The arrangements of her \"jūnihitoe\" robes were, however, described as fitting those of an older lady. (She was hidden in the beginning behind the \"sudare\" screen, however, as part of the courtly Heian rituals, the 12-layered sleeves were allowed to peek from under the screen. Based on the colour-arrangements, the suitor could see what kind of taste and status his lady had.) \n\nModern scholars, however, speculate that Suetsumuhana's nose, which was described in the \"Genji\" as being red and that of an elephant, probably resembles today's European noses. The ideal of female beauty in Heian was to have very fine, thin noses, as depicted in the painted scrolls. Anything that fell outside this courtly beauty ideal must have been seen as utterly obscene.\n\n\n"}

After a GTHL career mostly in AA hockey, Metropolit played two seasons for the Richmond Hill Riots Jr.B. hockey club (OHA) before heading west to play for the Vernon Vipers of the BCHL.\n\nAfter graduating Tier II Jr.A. hockey, Metropolit started out playing for the Nashville Knights in the ECHL in the 1995–96 season. He also played for the Pensacola Ice Pilots and Grand Rapids Griffins before making his NHL debut in 1999–2000 for the Washington Capitals. For the next three seasons, he alternated between the Capitals and the AHL's Portland Pirates, and also played two games for Tampa Bay in 2001–02.\n\nIn 2003 Metropolit crossed the Atlantic to play in Helsinki with Jokerit for the 2003–04 season. In a brilliant first season, he scored the most points on the team, 50, with 15 goals and 35 assists, the fifth-highest total during the regular season. He scored six goals during seven playoff games that year, but Jokerit were eliminated in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season Metropolit and Marko Jantunen were the team's best goal scorers during the regular season, both scoring 16 goals, and Metropolit scored the most points on the team with 31 assists, totalling 47 points; the eighth-highest total in the league. In the playoffs, he scored five goals and six assists, including a 3-on-5 shorthanded goal against Ilves's Vesa Toskala in the quarterfinals. The team went on to win the silver medal.\n\nMetropolit became a very popular player with the Jokerit fans, who had a number of chants dedicated to him. He is remembered as a gifted playmaker, with one of his favorite spots, on the outside of the left faceoff circle in the offensive zone, being called \"Metro's office\" by TV commentators and fans, in honour of Wayne Gretzky's \"office\" behind the goal. He and Marko Jantunen formed a memorable duo on the penalty kill, scoring several short-handed goals. His player number in Jokerit was #50.\n\nAfter two years with Jokerit, Metropolit moved to Switzerland where he won the Nationalliga A championship with HC Lugano. He also led the league in scoring during the regular season, which is where his infamous nickname \"The Underlying Theme\" was born by announcer Darren Bavister.\n\nIn 2006, Metropolit returned to North America when he was signed by the Atlanta Thrashers. After limited playing time with Atlanta, Metropolit was dealt near the trade deadline to the St. Louis Blues, along with a package of draft picks, in exchange for Blues centre/wing Keith Tkachuk.\n\nMetropolit became a free agent at the end of the season before being invited by the Boston Bruins to the team training camp. Just prior to the 2007–08 season on October 3, 2007, he signed a one-year contract with the Bruins. Having established a role within the checking lines and on the powerplay he excelled with the Bruins posting a career high 33 points in 82 games.\n\nMetropolit signed a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers as a free agent on July 1, 2008. He was placed on waivers and picked up near the trading deadline on February 27, 2009, by the Montreal Canadiens in need of a veteran centreman. He trained with the Philadelphia Flyers on the morning of February 27 before being claimed in the afternoon. Later that night, he played against his former team with the Montreal Canadiens. He scored his first goal with Montreal on March 10 against Dwayne Roloson from the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season on March 30, 2010, it was announced that Metropolit would miss the final 6 games of the season with a torn shoulder muscle, after enjoying a career high 16 goals with Montreal. An extremely speedy recovery allowed him to be back on the ice on April 19, 2010, for the third game of the playoff series against the Washington Capitals.\n\nOn August 2, 2010, Metropolit left the NHL as a free agent and signed a two-year contract to return the Swiss NLA with EV Zug. Upon completion of his contract with Zug, Metropolit moved to return to sign a two-year contract with HC Lugano. In the 2013–14 season, on February 5, 2014, Metropolit was traded to SC Bern in exchange for Mikko Lehtonen. After four years in Switzerland, he moved to Germany, spending a two-year stint at Adler Mannheim, capturing the German national championship in 2015.\n\nOn October 20, 2016, he signed with Italian club HC Bolzano, a member of the Austrian top-flight EBEL.

{"id": "2168511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168511", "title": "Nekemte", "text": "Nekemte\n\nNekemte (; ), also called Nakamti, is a market town and separate woreda in western Ethiopia. Located in the East Welega Zone of the Oromia Region, Nekemte has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation of 2,088 meters.\n\nNekemte was the capital of the former Welega Province, and is home to a museum of Wollega Oromo culture. It is a burial place of Onesimos Nesib, a famous Oromo who translated the Bible to Oromo Language for the first time, in collaboration with Aster Ganno. It is also the seat of an Apostolic Vicariate of the Roman Catholic Church. Nekemte is host city to the newly built Wollega University as of 2007. It is served by an airport that is not currently open to commercial flights.\n\nNekemte is at the center of the road network for south-western Ethiopia. The first major road dates to the early 1930s, with a road that extended from the capital Addis Ababa west through Addis Alem, although the road was passable only by lorries for the 255 kilometers between Addis Alem and Nekemte. A road connecting Nekemte to Gimbi, 110 kilometers in length, was part of the first stage of the Third Highway Program in 1963. Postal service for this city has been present as early as 1923. A branch of the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority began providing electricity to the city by 1960. By 1957, phone service extended to the city.\n\nNekemte like most of the towns of the Welega Province grew as a result of the rise of agricultural surplus after the Oromo became permanently settled in the early in the late 16th-century. Its rise was also closely connected with the rise of the Oromo institution of gada, a system where every 8 years leadership in the community was transferred to a new age class of leaders.\n\nNekemte was formerly overshadowed by nearby Lieka and Bilo, the former regional markets. Nekemte acquired some importance when Bekere Godana in 1841 extended his rule of Nekemte over more area to form a new polity. and later his son Moroda Bekere made it the capital of their kingdom of Welega in the mid-19th century. Under Mereda's son Kumsa Moroda (Gebregziabher Moroda after converting to Christianity), the town continued in its importance as it submitted to Shewan rule. The Russian explorer Alexander Bulatovich visited Nekemte 13 March 1897; in memoirs he describes its marketplace as \"a very lively place and presents a motley mixture of languages, dress, and peoples\", and carefully described the paintings in the town's newly constructed Ethiopian Orthodox church. In 1905, a central government customs office was officially opened in Nekemte. Construction on a hospital began in 1927, and was completed in 1932 with Swedish funds as well as contributions from \"Ras\" Tafari (who later became Emperor Haile Selassie). It formally opened 16 February 1932, although it had already been in operation for eight months.\n\nThe artist Daniel Twafe was born in 1934 in or near Nekemte. He studied in the United States in 1955-1957 and in Paris in 1971. He made more sculptures than paintings and became employed at the National Museum in Addis Ababa. Another from in this area was Mamo Tessema, who was born in 1935. He was trained at the Handicraft School in the school and went to the US for higher studies in 1958. He designed ceramics and also wrote some publications.\n\nBy 1935 Nekemte had become the most important town in Welega. There were nearly 70 foreign residents before the Italian occupation, mostly merchants and missionaries. 23 importers-exporters had agencies there, most of whom were Indians, but these also included two Greeks, a Lebanese, and an Armenian. The British explorer Dunlop, who spent four days of the same year in that town, noted that its central location on the main trade route between Addis Ababa and the Anglo-Sudan led to it having \"developed enormously during the preceding few years, as the new school, warehouses, stores, and hospital testified\".\n\nDuring the Italian invasion, Nekemte was bombed by the Italians 5 July 1936; this included dropping 19 bombs on the recently constructed school complex of the local Swedish mission. \"Dejazmach\" Habte Maryam, governor of Welega, accepted the Italians and received Colonel A. Marone who arrived by air on 14 October and the troops of Colonel Malta who reached the town on 24 October, after having marched by foot and mule for twelve days from Addis Alem, which weakened \"Ras\" Imru Haile Selassie's attempts as Prince Regent to establish a center of resistance at Gore. After his successful return to Ethiopia, on 20 May 1941 Emperor Haile Selassie visited Welega where fighting still continued and where Kebede Tesemma was in charge of the \"Arbegnoch\". When he attempted to visit Nekemte, his party came under artillery fire.\n\nA public address system was installed in the central square in Nekemte (and in ten other towns) in 1955, used for receiving transmission from Radio Addis Ababa and re-broadcasting it. In 1957 Haile Sellasie I School was opened, one of nine provincial secondary schools in Ethiopia and outside Eritrea. At that time Nekemte was still the end point of the telephone line westward. The Tafari Makonnen Leprosarium (founded that year) also had a home-school for children of leprous parents.\n\nHead of State Mengistu Haile Mariam visited Nekemte during a formal tour in March–May 1979. In that same year, over 300 Evangelical Christians had been imprisoned for political reasons.\n\nEarly in 1991, the Ethiopian Fourth Revolutionary Army had its headquarters at Nekemte. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front captured Nekemte on 2 April 1991, as part of Operation Freedom and Equality (\"Duula Bilisummaa fi Walqixxummaa\"). In response, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) said in a broadcast on the Radio Voice of Oromo Liberation (Frankfurt am Main) on 15 April 1991: \"The OLF strongly opposes the phrase: liberating Wellega or the Oromo nation. It is false for any alien force to say that it will liberate the Oromo nation.\"\n\nAfter the Ethiopian trade mission in the Somaliland city of Hargeisa was hit by a suicide bomb attack, which killed at least four Ethiopian civilian lives on 29 October 2008, three human rights activists working for the Ethiopian Human Rights Council in Nekemte were arrested, but were released by 27 November.\n\nThe city has a mil highland subtropical climate (Köppen: \"Cwb\"). With a higher elevation less than Adis Ababa, Nekemte has a slightly higher average temperature, differing mainly in the low averages. The average annual temperature is 18.3 °C (high: 24 °C and low: 12.6 °C), although to the north of Equator March is the warmest month and July the coldest month. It has one of the highest rainfall in Ethiopia in a short time. With more than 2080 mm, it is one of the rainiest places in the country. Nekemte is on an imaginary line where the western winds give places to the orient winds. It is one of the seven rainiest cities in the country. Recently in the last decade the annual average temperature of single meteorological station had a reduction of the average annual temperature to the value of the beginning of the decade of 1990, but are still higher than since the beginning of the record: around the year of 1970. The last few years of record had a greater precipitate at the same time as during a period of the 1980s there was one of the most sealed years of record history.\n\nThe 2007 national census reported a total population for this woreda of 75,219, of whom 38,385 were men and 36,834 were women. The majority of the inhabitants were Protestant, with 48.49% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 39.33% of the population said they observed Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 10.88% were Moslem.\n\nBased on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, this city has an estimated total population of 84,506 of whom 42,121 were males and 42,385 were females. The 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 47,258 of whom 22,844 were males and 24,414 were females. Nekemte is the largest city in Guto Wayu woreda.\n\nAssociation football is the main sport in Nekemte. The Welega Stadium, which has a capacity of 50,000, is the largest sports venue by capacity in Nekemte. It opened in 2019 and the stadium is also mainly used for football, and also for athletics.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Celine Goričke, a village near Marija Gorica.\n\nHis parents were Ana Vugrinec and Ivan Kovačić (1826–1906). They were married in Marija Gorica. Ivan was also called Janko and dreamed that Ante would become a priest.\n\nIn 1857, Ante and his parents went to Oplaznik.\n\nKovačić began to write in 1875. While his early works have Romantic tendencies, in later years he was influenced by Realist literature. His stories and novels often had strong satiric overtones and represent harsh criticism to injustice in Croatian society of his time. One of his novels, \"Među žabari\", remained unfinished because citizens of Karlovac protested after reading its first paragraphs in a local newspaper.\nThe best known work of Ante Kovačić is semi-autobiographic novel \"U registraturi\" (1888). In it he expressed great deal of sympathy for common Croatian people, most notably peasants whom he saw as superior to snobbish citizenry.\n\nKovačić was known as a staunch supporter of Ante Starčević and his Croatian Party of Rights. As such he was bitterly opposed to Ivan Mažuranić and wrote literal travesty of Mažuranić's poem \"The Death of Smail-aga Čengić\".\n\nIn his later years, Kovačić began to show symptoms of mental disorder which gradually affected his work, including the last chapters of \"U registraturi\".\n\n\"U registraturi\", combining biting social satire, naturalist descriptions of Croatian bureaucracy and peasantry, as well as fascination with the supernatural inherited from Romanticism, nevertheless remained the most powerful 19th century Croatian novel and one of the most enduring novels in Croatian history. In 1974 it was adapted into popular television mini-series starring Rade Šerbedžija.\n\nKovačić died of pneumonia in psychiatric hospital in Vrapče, Zagreb. He was insane at the moment of his death.\n\nHe was buried at Mirogoj Cemetery.\n\nKovačić's wife was called Milka Hajdin, with whom he had six children. Ante and Milka were married in Mala Gorica. Their daughters Olga and Marija were teachers, while their son Krešimir was a journalist, who died in 1960.\n\n"}

Many of the artists and dancers from said documentary, including Ice-T (who makes his film debut as a club MC), and Michael \"Boogaloo Shrimp\" Chambers, went straight from \"Breakin' 'n' Enterin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" to star in \"Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\".\n\nThe musical score featured the hits, \"Breakin'... There's No Stopping Us\" by Ollie & Jerry and \"Freakshow on the Dance Floor\" by The Bar-Kays.\n\n\"Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" was the final Cannon film production released by MGM/UA. After release, MGM and Cannon dissolved their distribution deal, reportedly over the potentially X-rated content in John Derek's film \"Bolero\" and MGM's then-policy of not theatrically releasing X-rated material, forcing Cannon to become an in-house distribution company once again. Because of this, \"Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" is considered to be the final financially profitable film released by Cannon.\n\n\"Breakin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" was followed by a sequel entitled \"\", released later in 1984.\n\nProtagonist Kelly Bennett (Lucinda Dickey) is a young dancer training under the supervision of a traditionalist choreographer, Franco (Ben Lokey). Through her friend Adam, Kelly is introduced to two street dancers, Ozone (Adolfo 'Shabba Doo' Quiñones) and Turbo (Michael 'Boogaloo Shrimp' Chambers) on the boardwalk at Venice Beach. Kelly becomes enamored with their dancing and becomes friendly with the men, dancing and talking with them. Eventually, the three form a team after dancing together. Kelly eventually leaves her studio as her choreographer does not respect breakdancing and makes unwanted advances towards her. Later, Kelly attends a dance audition and is shut down by harsh directors. Kelly then wanders to a breakdancing event where she finds Ozone and Turbo in the midst of a dance battle that they eventually lose against rivals \"Electro Rock\". A very defeated Ozone is consoled by Kelly. She convinces him and Turbo to enter a dance competition. Kelly's agent friend, James (Christopher McDonald), sees what the group can do and agrees to back them. However, the group is technically not allowed to perform in the dance audition because they only want \"respected\" forms of dance. Kelly and the crew dress up in black tie clothes to fool the judges and then start their audition. When the judges see their breakdancing, they are initially shocked and disapproving. However, the three eventually win over the judges and are chosen from the audition. The group goes on to be popular, remain friends, and dance in the community.\n\nAccording to the 2014 documentary \"\", Menahem Golan of Cannon Films was inspired to create this film after his daughter saw a breakdancer perform in Venice Beach, California. Golan pressured the production crew to complete the film before Orion Pictures released their breakdancing film \"Beat Street\".\n\nErik Abbey was the choreographer for the breakdancing scenes.\n\nThe soundtrack of the film was released by Polydor Records in 1984. The album contains the first performance on an album by rapper Ice-T (who had previously released some 12\" singles), produced by DJ Chris \"The Glove\" Taylor & David Storrs.\n\nDespite not being included on the official soundtrack, the film also features the previously released songs \"Boogie Down\" by Al Jarreau, \"Tour de France\" by Kraftwerk, \"Beatbox\" by Art of Noise and \"Tibetan Jam\" by Chris \"The Glove\" Taylor.\n\n\"Breakin\"' opened in 1,069 venues on May 4, 1984 and outgrossed \"Sixteen Candles\", which had more screens (1,240).

{"id": "2168551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168551", "title": "Grain Belt (beer)", "text": "Grain Belt (beer)\n\nGrain Belt is a brand of beer brewed in the American state of Minnesota, by the August Schell Brewing Company. The beer has been produced in a number of varieties. Grain Belt Golden was the original style introduced in 1893. The current offerings are: Grain Belt Premium, first introduced in 1947; Grain Belt Premium Light; Grain Belt Nordeast, introduced in April 7, 2010; and the newest offering, Grain Belt Lock & Dam, introduced in 2016. It was originally produced by the Minneapolis Brewing Company which formed with the merger of four smaller brewers in 1891. Soon after introduction, Grain Belt became the company's flagship product. It was brewed at the original Grain Belt brewery in Minneapolis, Minnesota until 1976. A series of other owners followed, and Schell took over the product line in 2002.\n\nThe name refers to the \"Grain Belt\" of the American Midwest where much of the world's supply of barley, corn, soybeans and other grains are produced. The diamond-shaped logo was introduced early on, though it wasn't until the late 1930s that a rendering of a bottlecap was added in the background.\n\nGrain Belt Golden, a traditional golden German-style lager, was popular, but Prohibition halted production from 1920 until 1933. The company temporarily changed its name to Golden Grain Juice Company and, like many other brewers, turned to making near beer and soft drinks until repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. Grain Belt Beer returned to taverns in October 1933 with bottled beer reappearing in December 1933.\n\nWorld War II brought rationing, and the company briefly had to drop cans altogether and resort to using green glass in its bottles, rather than the standard amber color which offered better protection from light. Sale of beer in bottles and cans had become dominant over draft sales in drinking establishments, so the brewer experimented with all sorts of packaging innovations, expanding the line after the war ended. A premium beer, called Grain Belt Premium, entered production in 1947. Conetop cans sealed with caps disappeared in the 1950s in favor of flat-top steel cans.\n\nMinneapolis Brewing company officially changed its name to Grain Belt Breweries in 1967 after purchasing the Storz Brewing Company of Omaha, Nebraska, United States, which marketed Storz Beer and Storz Tap Beer in bottles, cans and draft. Grain Belt also took over the line of the New Ulm, Minnesota-based Hauenstein Brewery two years later. The company's main slogan — intoned by a deep male voice on TV ads — was, \"Been a long time a-brewing.\" Eventually Grain Belt introduced a new beer called GBX Malt Liquor. For many years, the company also brewed Grain Belt Bock Beer for limited release in the spring. Grain Belt billboard signs could be seen on the scoreboard at Minnesota Vikings games and the beer was a popular choice in the stands at Minnesota Twins games. The label featured the image of a bubbling water fountain, which had been built on the park-like grounds of the brewery to tout the pure water used in the brewing process. Another ad slogan was, \"From perfect brewing water...\" \n\nAt the end of the 1960s, Grain Belt was the 18th-largest brewing company in the US, and a major force in the Midwest. Primary competitors up to this point had been local rivals, Theodore Hamm and Jacob Schmidt, both in St. Paul, Gluek Brewing Company, in Minneapolis, Cold Spring Brewing Company in Cold Spring, Minnesota and a few other regional brewers. Business began to decline as better-capitalized national brewing companies such as Anheuser-Busch, Schlitz and Miller began targeting the markets of regional brewers like Grain Belt. These companies swooped into markets, often advertising heavily, dropping prices and forcing regional brands like Grain Belt into the background since the smaller regional brewers were unable to match the big brewer's advertising and promotional budgets. In 1975, stockholders decided to sell the Grain Belt company to area businessman Irwin Jacobs, and operation ceased by the end of the year.\n\nIn 1976 the remains were sold to G. Heileman Brewing Company (based in La Crosse, Wisconsin), which closed the original Minneapolis brewery and moved production to the former Jacob Schmidt brewery in St. Paul, Minnesota, which Heileman had purchased only a few years before. At the St. Paul facility, former rivals Grain Belt and Schmidt were brewed side by side with Heileman stablemates Old Style and Special Export for many years. Heileman also launched a low calorie version of Grain Belt called Grain Belt Light.\n\nIn 1989, G. Heileman, citing over-capacity, closed the St. Paul brewery and moved production of Grain Belt to its La Crosse, Wisconsin brewery, taking production of the Grain Belt (and Schmidt) brands out of the Twin Cities for the first time. G. Heileman found itself faltering within a decade because of many of the same market pressures Grain Belt Breweries had faced in the 1970s. A group of investors was formed to purchase the Schmidt plant from Heileman. They also negotiated with Heileman to obtain the Schmidt brand, but Heileman declined to sell it. Instead, it offered the investors the rights to the Grain Belt brand. The investors accepted the counter offer, as it was a recognizable, established Twin Cities brand which it could market. The new company was called the Minnesota Brewing Company 1991. It thrived during the 1990s with sales peaking in 1996. Minnesota Brewing also performed extensive contract brewing for other beverage companies to improve efficiency and keep the plant operating closer to capacity.\n\nIn 2001, the company launched a line of specialty craft beers under the \"Brewer's Cave\" and \"Grain Belt Archive Series\" brand names. These beers were high quality, all-malt products brewed without adjunct grains such as corn or rice. Most were highly hopped and very flavorful to appeal to the new breed of craft beer drinkers. Unfortunately, in a classic case of \"too little, too late\", these fine Grain Belt beers came a bit late to save the company, which was facing financial problems. \n\nHistory repeated itself yet again, and by 2001 sales were off 50% from their 1996 highs. \nThe company's debt deepened, and Minnesota Brewing filed for bankruptcy in February 2002. On June 24, 2002 the brewery's doors were closed. The Grain Belt brand was bought in August 2002 by a longtime rival Minnesota brewer, the August Schell Brewing Company of New Ulm. Schell's brews and packages Grain Belt Premium, Grain Belt Premium Light, Grain Belt Nordeast, and Grain Belt Lock & Dam, primarily for the Minnesota market. Grain Belt Premium has since become Schell's most popular brand, and has earned an especially strong following in the younger demographic of the region. On February 16, 2018, Schell's announced that it would be adding to the Grain Belt family by canning its Grain Belt BLU variety (previously a Minnesota State Fair and limited release variety). Starting in 2015, Grain Belt released limited-edition 12 packs featuring football-themed labels and bottle cap games. \n\nThe former brewery building in Northeast, Minneapolis, located north of Broadway Street Northeast on the east bank of the Mississippi River, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was renovated and redeveloped by Ryan Companies for multiple tenants. The contributing structures include the Brewhouse, currently the home of RSP Architects, which was designed by the architectural firm of Wolff and Lehle; the power station (Boiler House); the Wagon Shed and Shops (Gasthaus), which has become the Pierre Bottineau Branch of Hennepin County Library; the Grain Belt Office Building (designed by Carl F. Struck); the Bottling House, including the 1969 addition, which now serves as a space for artist studios; the 1910 Warehouse, including its 1949 and 1957 additions, but not its 1964 addition, which has been developed into office and light industrial space; and a railroad spur. The Keg House is also part of the complex, but not part of the Registered Historic Place entry. The renovation has won the National Preservation Award from the American Institute of Architects. The area forms an anchor to the Northeast Minneapolis Arts District, including many members of the Northeast Minneapolis Arts Association. The 1964 addition to the warehouse will be demolished as part of the development of Sheridan Memorial Park.\n\nIn 1941, a 48-foot-high sign with the Grain Belt logo, illuminated by a mix of neon tubes and incandescent bulbs, was placed on the roof of the Marigold Ballroom in downtown Minneapolis. In 1950, the sign was moved to Nicollet Island, next to the Hennepin Avenue Bridge, and an illuminated green frame added around the logo. The sign sits on Nicollet Island, an island in the Mississippi, and is part of the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District. </ref> The sign was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.\n\nThe sign's illumination failed sometime after 1966; it was restored in 1989 and the sign lit intermittently until 1996. On December 30, 2017, the sign was again relit following a 15-year restoration campaign and the replacement of all the neon tubes and incandescent bulbs with LEDs.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2168556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168556", "title": "English Reformed Church, Amsterdam", "text": "English Reformed Church, Amsterdam\n\nThe English Reformed Church is one of the oldest buildings in Amsterdam, situated in the centre of the city. It is home to an English-speaking congregation which is affiliated to the Church of Scotland and to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (formerly Dutch Reformed Church). It comes under the Church of Scotland's International Presbytery, and is also known as the Scots Kirk in Amsterdam. The current minister is Rev. Lance Stone.\nThe address of the church, Begijnhof 48, indicates its origins. The Begijnhof, an enclosed courtyard, was a 14th-century residence for the sisterhood of the Catholic Beguines, and the church was originally established as their chapel. It was confiscated from the Catholic lay sisterhood during the Reformation. For this reason, the church is invisible from the street and can only be discovered by entering the courtyard through an inconspicuous archway.\n\nAs with other city churches, the keys of the chapel were surrendered to the Municipality when Amsterdam sided officially with the Prince of Orange and formally adopted Calvinist doctrines in 1578. The church, controlled by the Beguines, was taken by the city council and closed. In 1607, the church was re-opened for worship when the Municipality presented it to the English-speaking Protestants living in the city. Since then, services in English have continued practically without interruption to the present day. \n\nThe Catholic Beguines, deprived of their former oratory and daily Mass, who continued to live in several houses of the Begijnhof, refused to re-enter the chapel as they considered it \"desecrated by heresy\".\n\nThe dissenting English Protestants in Amsterdam in the early days of the English Church included a number, who, within a few years of their arrival in the city, left to form a separate congregation in Leiden and to sail via Delfshaven and Plymouth (in England) on the Mayflower to the New World in 1620. These Pilgrim Fathers are remembered in stained glass and memorials both within and outside the church.\n\nIn 1817—in the immediate aftermath of Napoleon's defeat and the restoration of rule by the House of Orange—ownership of the building was formally passed to the congregation, by then known as the English Reformed Church (\"ERC\"). It holds a regular Sunday morning service as well as other services and activities in the church. The ERC currently has 320 members from 30 nationalities. The church can seat 385 and attracts congregations of over 250 on a regular basis. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the church has provided Amsterdam with an important platform for the performance of chamber music of all periods and styles with over 70 concerts a year. In particular, it has given many young artists the opportunity to launch their careers. The Academy of the Begijnhof, founded by a former church organist, is now one of Amsterdam's premier baroque orchestras.\n\nTo mark the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the English Reformed Church Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited the church on 5 February 2007. She attended a normal church service, accompanied by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. \n\n\n"}

He was senior in rank to the Solicitor-General for Ireland: both advised the Crown on Irish legal matters. With the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, the duties of the Attorney General and Solicitor General \"for\" Ireland were taken over by the Attorney General \"of\" Ireland. The office of Solicitor General for Ireland was abolished at the same time, for reasons of economy. This led to repeated complaints from the first Attorney General of Ireland, Hugh Kennedy, about the \"immense volume of work\" which he was now forced to deal with single-handed.\n\nThe first record of the existence of the office of Attorney General in Ireland, some 50 years after the equivalent office was established in England, is in 1313 when Richard Manning was appointed King's Attorney (the title Attorney General was not widely used until the 1530s). The Attorney General was, initially, junior to the serjeant-at-law, but since the titles King's Serjeant and King's Attorney were often used interchangeably, it can be difficult to establish who held which office at any given time. From the early 1660s, due largely to the personal prestige of Sir William Domville, (AG 1660-1686), the Attorney General became the chief legal adviser to the Crown. In certain periods, notably during the reign of Elizabeth I, who thought poorly of her Irish-born law officers, the English Crown adopted a policy of choosing English lawyers for this office.\n\nThe Attorney General was always a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, and a strong Attorney, like Philip Tisdall, William Saurin, or Francis Blackburne, could exercise great influence over the Dublin administration. Tisdall (AG 1760-1777), was for much of his tenure as Attorney General also the Government leader in the Irish House of Commons, and a crucial member of the administration. Saurin (AG 1807-1822) was regarded for many years as the effective head of the Dublin Government. In 1841 Blackburne (AG 1830-1834, 1841-1842), on being challenged about a proposed appointment within his own office, said firmly that he \"would not tolerate a refusal to ratify the appointment\". The office of Attorney General was described as being \"a great mixture of law and general political reasoning\"\".\n\n\n\n\nincomplete\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office was vacant from 16 November 1921 and succeeded by the Attorney General of the Irish Free State on 31 January 1922.\n\n"}

It lost CBS to WTWO (channel 2) in 1955; that station had been founded by Carpenter. It lost DuMont soon afterward when that network shut down. After Carpenter sold WTWO to the Rines-Thompson family in 1959, the new owners changed that station's calls to WLBZ-TV and swapped affiliations with WABI-TV, making channel 5 a primary CBS affiliate. The two outlets then began to share ABC programming, which had previously been exclusive to WABI. This ended when WEMT (channel 7, now WVII-TV) signed-on in 1965 and took the affiliation. During the late 1950s, WABI was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.\n\nThe only other station that the Community Broadcasting Service would build and sign on was WMTW in Poland Spring, Maine. This was because the ownership of that station's founder Mount Washington Television, partially overlapped with Community Broadcasting Service. (WMTW was sold in 1964.) In 1957, it purchased WAGM-TV-AM in Presque Isle, Maine; it sold off WAGM-AM in 1981 and sold off WAGM-TV in 1984. Community Broadcasting Service merged with Journal Publications to form Diversified Communications in 1971; after the merger, it acquired such stations as WCTI-TV in New Bern, North Carolina, WYOU in Scranton–Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, WPDE in Florence–Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida. Most of these stations were sold off by the late 1990s; by 2017, it was down to two stations: WABI-TV and WCJB-TV.\n\nThe radio stations were eventually spun off in 1993 and are currently under the ownership of Blueberry Broadcasting.\n\nOn July 15, 2014, WABI-TV's contract with Dish Network expired, and both the station and WABI-DT2 were blacked out early on July 16, 2014. Among the issues WABI-TV cited included financial terms, customer service issues between the station and Dish Network, and switching viewers in several counties to another CBS station outside the Bangor designated marketing area (DMA) location (such as WGME in the Portland area). After a breakdown of contract talks which picked up slowly, an agreement was reached October 8, 2014, allowing both stations to return to Dish Network later that day.\n\nWABI-TV entered into an additional affiliation agreement with \"retro\" TV network Decades (a network co-owned by CBS) in 2015. The official launch date was announced as October 1, 2015; but the network soft-launched on a new third subchannel on September 24 at 2:30 p.m., a week prior to that date. However, WABI-DT3 experienced some technical difficulties that first week, losing video that night and again the following afternoon. The problem with the station's receiving satellite dish was, however, diagnosed and repaired, and no further difficulties occurred. WABI-DT3 is available to Spectrum customers in the Bangor DMA on digital channel 1255. Moosehead Enterprises also provides the channel to select customers in Greenville, Rockwood, Guilford and Monson, passing the signal through as channel 5.3. Bee Line Cable provides the channel to its subscribers on channel 5-13. There are no other announced prospective cable or satellite service pick-ups at this time.\n\nOn February 16, 2017, it was announced that WABI and its sister station WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida would be sold to Gray Television for $85 million. The deal reunited WABI with its former Diversified-owned station in Presque Isle, WAGM-TV. The sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on April 18, and the sale was completed on May 2. WABI-TV was the last station in the market to be locally owned.\n\nWABI-DT2, branded on-air as Eastern and Central Maine's CW, is the CW+-affiliated second digital subchannel of WABI-TV, broadcasting in 720p high definition on UHF channel 13.2 (or virtual channel 5.2 via PSIP).\n\nWABI-DT2 started broadcasting in late-1998 and had the fictional call letters \"WBAN\". It was part of The WB 100+ cable group as The WB required over-the-air affiliates above the top 100 markets to be on cable. \"WBAN\" gradually replaced low-powered WBGR-LP as the WB affiliate in Bangor. That station is now with America One and Ion Television. On Adelphia systems, this station was on channel 4 and known on-air as \"Bangor's WB 4\". In early 2006, it swapped channel positions with low-powered Fox affiliate WFVX-LP but continued using the same branding. On January 24, 2006, The WB and UPN announced the two networks would end broadcasting and merge. The new combined service would be called The CW. The letters would represent the first initial of corporate parents CBS (the parent company of UPN) and the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner. There was no UPN station in the market so Boston's WSBK-TV and Portland's WPME were piped in through cable.\n\nOn July 28, WABI announced it was creating a new second digital subchannel to become part of The CW. On the station's website, an announcement said Time Warner Cable (which was in the process of taking over cable coverage in the Bangor area for bankrupt Adelphia) would have \"WBAN\" on its system. WABI-DT2 would then become a simulcast of \"WBAN\" to provide over-the-air viewers access to the new network. The arrangement was part of a three-year deal with WABI which also let the main station be on the system as well. The CW launched on WABI-DT2 (call sign used officially) September 18. On January 10, 2007, WABI introduced redesigned websites for itself and WABI-DT2.\n\nIn addition to morning and prime time preemptions designated for local news, WABI-DT2 preempts the allowed two hours in daytime (noon to 2:00 pm) for syndicated fare. The channel also preempts some CW Plus overnight infomercials in order to provide additional syndicated shows and movies. It occasionally preempts on Saturday afternoons in the fall to air \"SEC on CBS\" college football games preempted for local programming on the main station. On June 15, 2012, WABI-DT2 upgraded to high definition as part of a national upgrade of The CW Plus.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nAt one point, WABI operated an analog repeater (W61AO channel 61) licensed to Calais with a transmitter in Meddybemps. The transmitter tower was shared with W57AQ channel 57 which repeated WLBZ. Until the mid-1990s, W61AO was used to feed cable systems across the border to the Canadian Maritimes. With the advent of CANCOM, however, WABI's cross-border carriage declined. It is not offered on any systems across the border today including those in St. Stephen, New Brunswick within W61AO's former signal range. Most cable systems in Atlantic Canada now carry WBZ-TV from Boston for CBS programming. The W61AO license was canceled by the FCC at WABI's request on November 9, 2009.\n\nWABI's broadcasts became digital-only, effective on June 12, 2009. On January 4, 2010, the FCC issued a \"Report & Order\" allowing WABI to move from this allotment to VHF channel 13. The station made this move to be consistent with other full-power stations in the market (which are also on the VHF dial) to save on energy costs as well as improve reception of the station. At 2:00 pm in the afternoon on December 13, 2010, WABI turned off channel 19 and commenced operations on channel 13.\n\nWhile WABI's past practice was to preempt the \"CBS Overnight News\" in favor of syndicated programming, as of 2016 the station generally carries the full slate of CBS programming. Syndicated programming on WABI includes \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", and \"The Dr. Oz Show\" among others. WABI-TV also airs first-run episodes of \"The Big Bang Theory\" through CBS.\n\nAt one point, it did not carry all of the network's Southeastern Conference (SEC) college football games on weekends. For several years, the games that were not shown appeared on low-powered Ion affiliate WBGR-LP. WABI preempted CBS games that conflicted with local sports programming and/or its weekend 6 p.m. news and 7 p.m. programming during Nielsen ratings periods. The national games were moved to CW outlet WABI-DT2 effective with the 2009 season. As of 2016, WABI carries all SEC football games cleared by CBS, with the local newscasts airing on WABI-DT2.\n\nThe station often preempted CBS programming to air University of Maine sports. It usually rescheduled network prime time to air late-night or the next morning. WABI ended its longtime carriage of UMaine sports in 2013 after failing to reach a new contract with Learfield Sports (which handles marketing for UMaine sports broadcasts); it had been the television flagship of the Black Bear Sports Network for the bulk of its history, with the only break between 1989 through 1997, when WLBZ-TV held the rights. WABI now airs a package of six high school football games on Friday nights during the season (in addition to its long-standing coverage of the championship games). Black Bear sports telecasts would subsequently move to WVII-TV and WFVX-LD.\n\nFor its entire existence, WABI has often earned more viewership than competitors WLBZ and WVII combined.. Of the big three network-affiliated television stations in the area, it offers the most live newscasts originating from Bangor. WLBZ serves as a semi-satellite of sister station WCSH in Portland and all newscasts originate from the WCSH studios. WVII only airs four newscasts a day, and its late newscast is pre-taped in advance.\n\nWABI's longtime dominance can also be attributed to its status as the market's last locally owned-and-operated commercial station (prior to the sale to Gray Television). Furthermore, some of its main personnel have remained employed at the station for more than 20 years, which is unusual since Bangor has always been a fairly small market.\n\nOn October 11, 2010, WABI became Maine's first station to upgrade newscasts to high definition level. Unlike sister station WCJB-TV in Gainesville, Florida which revamped its on-air appearance when it converted to high definition newscasts back in January 2009, WABI's newscast elements stayed the same except for slightly updated on-screen graphics. Newscasts seen on WABI-DT2 were not included in the upgrade because the subchannel only aired in standard definition. WABI-DT2 upgraded to HD on June 15, 2012, at which point all local newscasts on the subchannel were also upgraded to HD. In addition to its main studios, WABI operates a Central Maine Bureau on Main Street in Waterville.\n\nCorresponding with the launch of The CW on September 18, 2006, WABI-DT2 added local news and weather cut-ins during its airing of the nationally syndicated morning show \"The Daily Buzz\" from 6:00 am until 8:00 am. A simulcast of the weekday noon news was also added. This was subsequently shifted to a rebroadcast at 12:30 pm in September 2008. A new half-hour weeknight newscast at 10:00 pm known as \"WABI-TV 5 Prime Time News on The CW\" debuted on its schedule featuring a modified set and \"CW\" labeled mics. That show competes with a one-hour broadcast seen at the same time on low-powered Fox affiliate WFVX-LD which is produced by WVII. In January 2008, WABI-DT2 replaced the first half hour of the second hour of \"The Daily Buzz\" with a thirty-minute extension of the main station's weekday morning show (and that 7:00 am–7:30 a.m. morning newscast of WABI-DT2 is now an hour later re-airing of the 6:00 am—6:30 a.m. segment). Known as \"WABI-TV 5 Morning News on The CW\", this production is taped in advance and competes with live local news seen at the same time on WFVX-LD (which is also produced by WVII).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168566", "title": "Ysopet", "text": "Ysopet\n\nYsopet (\"Little Aesop\") refers to a medieval collection of fables in French literature, specifically to versions of Aesop's Fables. Alternatively the term Isopet-Avionnet indicates that the fables are drawn from both Aesop and Avianus.\n\nThe origin of the term 'Ysopet' dates back to the twelfth century, where it was first used by Marie de France, whose collection of 102 fables, written in Anglo-Norman octosyllabic couplets, she claims to have translated from an original work by Alfred the Great. Since there is no evidence of any such Old English material, this has been disputed.\n\nThe fables come from a variety of sources and feature not simply animals (and insects) but human beings as well. The first forty correspond to one of the Romulus collections of Aesop but even here there are variations. The story she calls \"The Dog and the Cheese\" differs from Classical versions of \"The Dog and its Reflection\" precisely in the detail that it is cheese rather than a bone or piece of meat that it is carrying. Many other stories make their first appearance in the \"Ysopet\", particularly those featuring human beings. One at least, \"The Mouse Takes a Wife\", only appears for the first time in the West but has earlier eastern analogues. Others still fit into well established categories of folk tale and suggest an oral transmission.\n\nIt is in drawing moral conclusions from the behaviour of the characters involved that Marie is at her most individual, reflecting the realities of 12th century feudal society at the same time as concern for the individual welfare of those within it. While she accepts its stratification, her criticism of those who abuse their position is sharp and her sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden is obvious. In particular she criticizes the inequalities of the legal system (\"The Wolf and the Lamb\", \"The Dog and the Sheep\"), injudicious choice of deputy and betrayal of faith.\n\nMarie's portrayal of women in particular is two-edged and not always consistent. In the tale of \"The Wife and her Husband\", where a resourceful wife persuades the husband that he has not really seen her in bed with another man, Marie remarks that 'good sense and imagination are more valuable and useful to many people than their money or their family'. But in the similar situation of \"The Wife and Her Husband in the Forest\" she concludes that 'for this reason women are criticized for their deceptiveness: these lying tricksters have more art than the devil.' The humorous ending of the otherwise horrifying story of \"The Man and the Wife Who Quarreled\", in which a husband cuts out the tongue of his wife only to have her continue their quarrel in sign language, draws from Marie the wry comment that 'This fable shows what one can often see: if a fool talks foolishness and someone else comes along and speaks sense to him, he won't believe it but gets angry instead. Even when he knows he is absolutely in the wrong, he wants to have the last say, and no one can make him shut up.' The change of gender at the end indicates that for Marie, as for Jean de la Fontaine five centuries later, 'Many men are women too' (Fables VI.6). Her main concern is not gender politics but, as throughout the \"Ysopet\", the wise, foolish or vicious use of the tongue.\n\nThe introduction and the first few fables in Mary Lou Martin's translation can be found in the limited preview on Google Books \n"}
{"id": "2168573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168573", "title": "Mono (Japanese band)", "text": "Mono (Japanese band)\n\nMono (stylised as MONO) is a Japanese instrumental band, formed in 1999 in Tokyo. The band consists of Takaakira \"Taka\" Goto (electric guitar, glockenspiel), Hideki \"Yoda\" Suematsu (electric guitar, glockenspiel), Dahm Majuri Cipolla (drums), and Tamaki Kunishi (bass guitar, electric guitar, piano, glockenspiel).\n\nMono has released nine studio albums. The band spent their early years, from 1999 to 2003, touring Asia, Europe, and America continuously, and released two studio albums, \"Under the Pipal Tree\" (2001) and \"One Step More and You Die\" (2002) on the Tzadik Records and Music Mine Inc. record labels, respectively. From 2004 to 2007, Mono signed to Temporary Residence Limited, released two more studio albums, \"Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined\" (2004) and \"You Are There\" (2006), and toured worldwide in their support. In 2008, the band took a break, returning one year later with a new studio album, \"Hymn to the Immortal Wind\" (2009), also on Temporary Residence Limited. During the tour that followed they recorded a live album, \"Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra\" which was released in 2010. In October 2016 the band released their ninth studio album, titled \"Requiem for Hell\". Their most recent effort, 'Nowhere Now Here' was released on January 25, 2019 through Pelagic Records, and was produced by the band's longtime friend Steve Albini at Electrical Audio, Chicago. It also contains Tamaki's first vocals for the band on the track 'Breathe'.\n\nThe band have cited a variety of experimental, avant-rock and classical music artists as inspirations but stated that their aim is to transcend genre, rejecting the post-rock label which has often been applied to them. Mono's sound is characterised by the lead and rhythm guitars of Goto and Yoda respectively, both of whom make extensive use of reverb, distortion and delay effects. The band's live performances are noted for their intensity, both in the playing and in the dynamics.\n\nIn January 1999, Tokyo native electric guitarist Takaakira \"Taka\" Goto began composing music and spent the remainder of the year searching for other musicians with which to form an instrumental rock band; eventually recruiting long-time friend and fellow electric guitarist Hideki \"Yoda\" Suematsu on rhythm guitar. By December 1999, Tamaki Kunishi and Yasunori Takada had joined Mono on bass guitar and drums, respectively. The band played their first show in late January 2000, at Club 251 in Setagaya, Tokyo. In May 2000, the band entered Rinky Dink Studio in Tokyo and recorded their first extended play with engineers Tetsuya Morioka and Toshiro Kai, which was later self-released in September 2000: a Japan-only release titled \"Hey, You\" on their own independent record label, Forty-4. The band spent the bulk of the year composing more music and performing at various houses around Tokyo, in the neighbourhoods of Setagaya, Shimokitazawa, and Shibuya. Mono also travelled to the United States to play a one-off show in November at the Mercury Lounge in New York City; a show which was later described by Paul Wheeler of rockofjapan.com as having a \"big beautiful sound that [...] naturally [expanded] through each song.\"\n\nFollowing the release of the \"Hey, You\" extended play, Mono spent the next year playing shows throughout their native Japan, as well as playing several shows in New York City and Sweden. The band also made an appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas. Between performing in Japan, Mono recorded their first studio album, \"Under the Pipal Tree\" at Studio Take-1 and Forty-4 in Tokyo. The majority of the tracks were recorded live (a trend which the band would adopt for all subsequent studio albums) in one day, the recording session of which was funded by experimental American musician John Zorn, with the band handling production duties. The album featured two previously released tracks (from the \"Hey, You\" extended play), as well as six original compositions. The album was released worldwide through New York City record label Tzadik, owned and operated by John Zorn.\n\nAfter the release of \"Under the Pipal Tree\", the band spent the next year touring Japan and the United States, also visiting Germany and Taiwan in support of the album, as well as composing new material inspired by the tour. In June 2002, between shows in Japan, the band recorded their second studio album, \"One Step More and You Die\" at Little Bach and Sound City studios in Tokyo, with Mono again handling production duties. The album was released in Japan in October of that year on Japanese record label Music Mine Inc. The band spent most of 2003 touring in support of the album, returning to Japan, the United States, Sweden, and visiting Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom for the first time.\n\nMono's next release was a collaboration with Japanese musician Aki Onda; whom the band met while touring New York in 2002. The band, Onda, and several notable members of the New York experimental music scene (including DJ Olive, Jackie-O Motherfucker, and Loren Connors) remixed \"One Step More and You Die\". The album, titled \"New York Soundtracks\", was released in February 2004 on Human Highway, Mono's own record label, and a successor to Forty-4.\n\nIn January 2004, the band began a long partnership with Chicagoan recording engineer Steve Albini, recording their third studio album at Electrical Audio Engineering in Chicago, Illinois. The album, titled \"Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined\" was released in April 2004 on Human Highway in Japan, and on Rykodisk in Europe and Temporary Residence Limited in the United States later in the year. After the album's release, the band embarked upon a year-long tour of America, Asia, and Europe.\n\nThe band also spent 2005 touring Asia, America, and Europe composing music, and eventually returning to Electrical Audio Engineering in February and September to record their fourth studio album with Steve Albini. The album, titled \"You Are There\" was released in Japan in March 2006 on Human Highway, and on Temporary Residence Limited in the United States and Europe. Mono also collaborated with Japanese musician World's End Girlfriend in 2005, releasing a collaboration studio album in December of that year, on Human Highway, and with American band Pelican, releasing a split album with the band through Temporary Residence Limited in October 2005.\n\nMono spent 2006 and 2007 touring Asia, America and Europe in support of \"You Are There\". In October 2006, the band returned to Electrical Audio Engineering and recorded a four-track extended play, which was released in April 2007 as part of Temporary Residence Limited's Travels in Constants series, titled \"The Phoenix Tree\". In November 2006, the band released a two-track extended play titled \"Memorie dal Futuro\" through Vinyl Films, and also contributed a track to a Temporary Residence Limited compilation album, \"Thankful\". In September 2007, the band released their first compilation album, compiling material from all previous extended plays, split albums, and compilations, titled \"Gone: A Collection of EPs 2000–2007\", as well as the music documentary DVD, \"The Sky Remains the Same as Ever\", documenting the worldwide tours of 2006 and 2007 and the recording of \"The Phoenix Tree\" extended play.\n\nIn 2008, the band took a year-long break from touring, spending the time composing new music and playing a handful of shows throughout the year, including an appearance at All Tomorrow's Parties in Somerset, England, curated by Explosions in the Sky in May. Mono returned to Electrical Audio Engineering in June and November 2008 to record their fifth studio album, \"Hymn to the Immortal Wind\", which was later released in March 2009, and followed by a year-long tour of America and Eurasia. The band played a ten-year anniversary show at the Society for Ethical Culture Hall in New York, United States on 8 May 2009, accompanied by the 24-piece Wordless Music Orchestra. The performance was recorded and later released as both a live album and a DVD, named \"Holy Ground: NYC Live With The Wordless Music Orchestra\", through Temporary Residence Limited in Europe and America, and Human Highway in Asia. The band then took another year-long break and went into \"hibernation mode\", returning to Japan to work on songs for a new album.\n\nMono spent early 2012 recording a new album at Waterfront Studios in Hudson, New York, with recording engineers Henry Hirsch, accompanied by the Wordless Music Orchestra. The album was mixed by Fred Weaver at his studio, Apocalypse the Apocalypse, in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. \"For My Parents\" was MONO's first record in eight years not to be recorded by Steve Albini at Electrical Audio Studios in Chicago. \"For My Parents\", was released on 4 September 2012, through Temporary Residence Limited. The band's press release for \"For My Parents\" states \"We hope that this album serves as a gift from child to parent. While everything else continues to change, this love remains a constant throughout time.\"\n\nMono released a double album on 24 October 2014, two contrasting records: The Last Dawn, being a more traditional Mono record; and Rays of Darkness, some of their heaviest material, even more notable for the first use of vocals on \"The Hand That Holds The Truth\".\n\nMono announced the forthcoming release of Requiem For Hell on 19 July 2016, their ninth studio album. It reintroduces strings to their sound. It was also their first full album under the newly formed label Pelagic Records. Prior to the full release of Requiem For Hell they did a split album with The Ocean (\"Transcendental\") to commemorate this event. Later it was known that it was actually a sneak peek of the first two songs of their upcoming album.\nOn December 9, 2017 they announced via their social media pages that Yasunori Takada (drum kit, glockenspiel, synthesizer), who has been a member since the start, will leave the band due to \"personal reasons.\" He was replaced by Dahm Majuri Cipolla beginning with the band's live performance on August 9, 2018.\n\nStarting in August 2018, they worked on their next project with Steve Albini at Electrical once again. On September 25, 2018, the new album was revealed to be called \"Nowhere Now Here,\" their first with Cipolla, it was released January 25, 2019.\n\nTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of MONO, and the 10th anniversary of \"Hymn to the Immortal Wind\", Temporary Residence Ltd. released \"Hymn to the Immortal Wind - Anniversary Edition\". Featuring remastered versions of the original.\n\nAlthough Mono's musical style has developed throughout their career, it has primarily been characterised by dynamic, guitar-based instrumental soundscapes, the majority of which are composed by lead guitarist Takaakira Goto, in an attempt to channel and express the emotions of joy and sorrow. The band's style of music originally featured elements of minimalism and noise, and later developed to integrate more complex, orchestral arrangements and instrumentation. Mono's music has been categorised as both contemporary classical and post-rock, but Goto has stated:\n\nMono has toured worldwide several times. Their live show tends to feature intense and emotional playing by the band members, as well as using extreme dynamics (in crescendos as well as diminuendos) in their attempt to create an \"unforgettable\" live performance. When recording their music, the band has always played live in the studio and, from 2004's \"Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined\" to 2009's \"Hymn to the Immortal Wind\", worked with Chicagoan recording engineer Steve Albini, whom they feel accurately captured a live band's \"raw emotion to [magnetic] tape.\"\n\nMono has drawn influence from various musical and non-musical sources throughout their career. When the band first formed, their main influences were American experimental rock band Sonic Youth and Anglo-Irish shoegaze band My Bloody Valentine when making \"Under the Pipal Tree\" and \"One Step More and You Die\". As the band broadened their musical tastes, starting with the album, \"Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined\", they began to be influenced by music from sources such as German classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven, Italian film score composer Ennio Morricone, and later Polish minimalist composer Henryk Górecki, among others. Lead guitarist Takaakira Goto has also acknowledged Danish film director Lars von Trier (in particular the 1996 film, \"Breaking the Waves\") as a major influence since the band's formation, in terms of expressing the different depths and heights of emotion.\n\nIn terms of instrumentation, Mono is a four-piece instrumental rock band. Goto, the group's lead guitarist, uses a 1966 Fender Jazzmaster through Boss, Danelectro, SiB, and Morley effects pedals, into a Fender Twin, a Marshall JCM 2000 head, and a Marshall cabinet for amplification. Yoda, the rhythm guitarist, uses a 1974 Fender Stratocaster through Boss, Tech 21 and Pro Co effects pedals, into a Fender Twin for amplification. Kunishi, the group's bass guitarist, pianist and occasional guitarist uses a 1966 Gibson EB-3 through Boss, TC Electronic, and Tech 21 effects pedals, into an Ampeg B2-R head and a Sunn bass cabinet, as well as a Fender Rhodes, and a Fender Jazzmaster. Takada, the drummer, uses a four-piece 1970s Ludwig drum kit, with Zildjian, Sabian, and Paiste cymbals, as well as a Korg microKORG synthesizer.\n\nAs the band's career has progressed, they have incorporated string sections on record, beginning with \"Under the Pipal Tree\", which featured use of cello, continuing with \"One Step More and You Die\" and \"Walking Cloud and Deep Red Sky, Flag Fluttered and the Sun Shined\" which both featured string quartets, and \"You Are There\", which featured a string quintet. On \"Hymn to the Immortal Wind\", the band made use of a 28-piece chamber orchestra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168575", "title": "Maalox", "text": "Maalox\n\nMaalox was a brand of antacid owned by Sanofi. Their main product was a flavored liquid containing aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide, which acts to neutralize or reduce stomach acid, for the purpose of relieving the symptoms of indigestion, heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and also stomach or duodenal ulcers. In large doses, it can act as a laxative. The trademark is owned by Novartis International AG, and was first produced commercially in 1949.\n\nThe acronym ‘MAALOX’ refers to the solution’s compositional elements: MAgnesium and ALuminium as OXides of hydrogen, in an anionic, aqueous hydroxide solution. This reacts with cationic, aqueous hydrochloride found in the gut, resulting in ion-exchange neutralisation of the acid base into water and/or salt. \n\nSome may find certain Maalox medications, such as Maalox Multi-Action, to be a successful anti-diarrhea treatment due to the aluminium hydroxide content, which in normal situations has a tendency to result in constipation. Maalox may also be used to treat nausea and stomach cramps associated with dyspepsia, diarrhea, or constipation.\n\nMaalox was developed in a collaboration between William H. Rorer, Inc., and a medical doctor and researcher specializing in gastrointestinal issues, Alison Howe Price from Philadelphia. The collaboration occurred after World War II when Claude Newhart, a salesman and pharmacist for the company, had an idea that he thought might change the company's fortunes. According to the Rorer family, he suggested that instead of selling pain relievers manufactured by others, they should create their own products. Gerald Rorer, then President of Rorer, told Newhart to \"go and find something.\" Newhart took up the challenge and contacted an old acquaintance from his student days working at a Philadelphia drugstore, Martin H. Rehfuss, who happened to be chief of medicine at Thomas Jefferson Hospital. It was Rehfuss who introduced Newhart to Price. Soon thereafter, Newhart convinced Price to become a consultant for the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania based Willam H. Rorer, Inc. In the end, Maalox became the first product the partnership produced. Maalox eventually became the world's best selling antacid and forever changed the company's fortunes.\n\nLiquid Maalox contains aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and simethicone.\n\nMaalox Regular Strength chewable tablets contain 600 mg of calcium carbonate. Maalox Extra Strength + Anti-Gas tablets contain 1000 mg of calcium carbonate and 60 mg of simethicone.\n\nMaalox is used to treat moderate dyspepsia, which includes symptoms of a burning sensation in the stomach or chest area, bloating, and/or gas pain, especially occurring after meals. It is used in combination with oxycodone to treat esophageal pain in cancer therapy patients. It is also a common component of a GI cocktail used in emergency rooms.\n\nMaalox is used in scientific research to simulate for silt/mud/soil in water, along with other dissolved particulates. The particulate size exceeds 11 micrometres.\n\nMaalox can be used as a standalone antacid treatment or in conjunction with prescription strength medication such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers.\n\nActivists in the United States, the Czech Republic, Venezuela, and Turkey have reported using Maalox or other antacid solutions diluted with water as a home remedy for tear gas attacks.\n\nMaalox generally doesn’t produce serious side effects in individuals who use it for less than two weeks, but some mild side effects may appear. Possible side effects of Maalox include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and headaches. These symptoms generally go away without further treatment. It may be necessary to contact a doctor if these symptoms become severe or persist for long periods of time. Maalox has been linked to phosphate deficiencies in some individuals as a result of the aluminum binding to phosphate in the stomach. This causes the body to flush out this important chemical which can lead to a deficiency. \n\nWomen who are pregnant can, with the permission of a health care provider, use this product as the aluminum content is deemed safe for the developing or nursing child. Individuals who suffer from kidney issues, however, should not take this product unless advised to do so by a doctor.\n\nIn February 2012, Novartis Consumer Health announced that they were temporarily, voluntarily suspending operations at the Novartis Consumer Health Lincoln facility that produces Maalox as well as suspending shipments.\n\nThe shutdown was a result of inspections in 2011. \"Two FDA inspections that year, about five months apart, noted numerous instances of the company not addressing consumer complaints and, in some cases, ignoring them.\" At that time, Novartis decided to stop manufacturing Maalox at their Lincoln plant and to have third parties produce it. The problems at the Lincoln plant included the possibility of chipped particles from one medication being mixed into the bottles of other medications as well as 1,300 other consumer complaints.\n\nIn August 2013, there was a recall of Maalox products. \"The recall encompasses 9 different types of its Maalox chewable tablets, including more than 3.4 million bottles of Maalox Advanced Maximum Strength Antacid & Antigas.\" They planned to restart production on a line-by-line basis, but the Maalox line had not by then been restarted.\n\nAs at 2014, Novartis's Maalox brand was to be merged, along with other consumer brands, with the consumer brands of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). This was part of a $20 billion exchange of business units between the two companies.\n"}

Lina and Ignas are quite popular Lithuanian names.\n\nArcheological findings and artefacts - mounds show that people lived in the territory of Ignalina already in 9th century. It is supposed that the territory of Ignalina earlier belonged to the ancient land of Nalšia, which was mentioned in 1229–1298. The toponyms and hidronyms demonstrate that it was inhabited by the Baltic tribe Selonians.\n\nEven though there is archeological evidence that people lived in Ignalina area in the Stone Age, Ignalina was mentioned only in 1810.

It was the first half-hour \"Garfield\" TV special. It is directed by Phil Roman and features Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield the house cat, as well as the voices of Sandy Kenyon, Henry Corden and Gregg Berger.\n\nThe special was first broadcast October 25, 1982 on CBS. It was a Nielsen ratings success and was nominated for two Emmy Awards. It was accompanied by a soundtrack album and a children's book adaptation and has been released on VHS and DVD.\n\nThis was the first of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991.\n\nGarfield and Odie are outside harassing a neighbor's dog when the owner, Hubert, calls the pound to capture them. When the dogcatcher arrives at the scene, Garfield flees, but Odie is too stupid to run away and is captured. Garfield decides to go home, but he is unable to talk to Jon Arbuckle that Odie is in peril. Garfield soon realizes how boring life is without Odie around, so that night, Garfield decides to rescue him from the pound. Although Garfield successfully makes it to the pound, the dogcatcher captures him and later puts him behind bars, where Garfield learns from another cat, Fast Eddie, that Odie is going to be euthanized the next day.\n\nDuring the night, Garfield has a series of flashbacks of all the good times that he and Odie had playing together. The next day, Garfield tearfully watches the dogcatcher take Odie down the hall to be euthanized. Meanwhile, a girl arrives at the pound for a pet and chooses Garfield. Garfield sees his chance to escape and when the cell opens, he runs out the door and past the girl. The rest of the animals flood out of the cell, rescue Odie, and break down the pound door, with the knocked-out dogcatcher on it.\n\nAs the animals run to freedom, Garfield and Odie return to Jon's house and later knock down its front door. Jon bets that Garfield and Odie were having fun during the night while he was worried about them, and Garfield and Odie are bemused and indicate this is correct. The next morning at breakfast, things are back to normal as Garfield derides Odie's begging at the table, but decides to try it himself after seeing Odie get a steak from Jon. All Garfield gets from Jon is a plate of bacon and eggs which he angrily throws back in to Jon's face before admitting \"I'm only human,\" as the special comes to a close.\n\nA soundtrack album for \"Here Comes Garfield\" was released on LP and cassette on Epic Records in 1982. It featured songs from and inspired by the television special, composed by Ed Bogas and Desirée Goyette and performed by Goyette and Lou Rawls. Some of these songs were released in re-recorded versions on the 1991 \"Am I Cool or What?\" album.\n\n\n\"Here Comes Garfield\" was \"Garfield\" creator Jim Davis' first television special, coming after his 1980 book \"\" topped \"The New York Times\" bestsellers list. For the opening sequence, Garfield dances to the theme song. In 1981, Davis was working in a California studio on how to convincingly depict this, as in previous comics, the fictional cat always walked on all four feet. \"Peanuts\" creator Charles M. Schulz was in the same studio that day, and redrew Davis' work, advising him, \"The problem is, you've made Garfield's feet too small. Little tiny cat feet\". \"Peanuts\" TV special producers Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelson also produced \"Here Comes Garfield\", a consequence of the two comics sharing the same syndicate, United Media.\n\nLou Rawls, who had just completed a USO tour at army bases, joined the \"Garfield\" franchise with this project, and finished recording the soundtrack in the summer of 1982. He explained his decision, \"I figured if Bill Cosby could do \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" and live forever on the earnings, why can't I do \"Garfield\"?\"\n\nBesides her contribution to the music, Desirée Goyette was also the performance model for Garfield's dance during the title song.\n\n\"Here Comes Garfield\" was first aired by CBS, on October 25, 1982, along with the 1966 \"Peanuts\" special \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\". It was viewed by an audience of 50 million people. This was considered a good rating, leading to speculation CBS could launch a successful series of \"Garfield\" specials similar to the \"Peanuts\" specials.\n\nBallantine Books published a 64-page illustrated book adaptation in September 1982. In July 2004, \"Here Comes Garfield\" was released on the DVD \"Garfield as Himself\", along with \"Garfield on the Town\" (1983) and \"Garfield Gets a Life\" (1991).\n\nAt the 35th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1983, \"Here Comes Garfield\" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and Phil Roman was nominated for the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animated Programming. In 2004, DVD Talk critic Randy Miller judged the \"Garfield as Himself\" specials to be \"quite enjoyable,\" highlighting \"a daring dog pound rescue\". The DVD debuted 35th in sales.\n\n"}

Southern limits are the Vindhyas and Chota Nagpur Plateau. On the east the Ganges merges with the Brahmaputra through a complex system of common distributaries into the Bay of Bengal. Its catchment lies in the states of Uttar Pradesh (294,364 km²), Madhya Pradesh (198,962 km²), Bihar (143,961 km²), Rajasthan (112,490 km²), West Bengal (71,485 km²), Haryana (34,341 km²), Himachal Pradesh (4,317 km²), Delhi, Arunachal pradesh(1,484 km²), the whole of Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.

The basin has a population of more than 500 million, making it the most populated river basin in the world.\n\nThe basin comprises semi-arid valleys in the rain shadow north of the Himalaya, densely forested mountains south of the highest ranges, the scrubby Shiwalik foothills and the fertile Gangetic Plains. Central highlands south of the Gangetic Plain have plateaus, hills and mountains intersected by valleys and river plains. The important soil types found in the basin are sand, loam, clay and their combinations such as sandy loam, silty clay etc.\n\nThe annual surface water potential of the basin has been assessed as 525 km³ in India, out of which 250 km³ is utilisable water. There is about 580,000 km² of arable land; 29.5% of the cultivable area of India.\n\nWater-related issues of the basin are due to both high and low flows. In India, the states of Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal are affected by floods. Bangladesh – at the confluence of Brahmaputra River and Ganges River – suffers from severe floods almost every year. Northern Ganges tributaries such as Kosi, Gandak and Mahananda are the most flood-prone, but southern tributaries also contribute. Low flows are caused by scarcity of rainfall outside the summer Monsoon, and sometimes by failure of this monsoon to develop to its normal extent.\nThe Ganges is joined by Kosi, Ghaghra, Gandak from the Himalayas and by Chambal, Betwa, Son from the peninsular region.\n\n"}

Unlike almost all their forebears, they had outside cylinders, Walschaerts valve gear, and a very short wheelbase of to go round curves of . Above footplate level they were very similar to the 9400 class, and shared the same Standard no.10 boiler. The surprises were below the (very small) footplate, where they resembled the USATC S100 Class that the GWR and other railways had used during the Second World War. \n\nAlthough a sound design, the class had limited usefulness as they were route-restricted by their high weight and were unsuitable for fast running because of their short wheelbase. Largely confined to empty stock workings at London Paddington station, their lives were short; for example 1509 lasted barely ten years in BR service. Four of the class, 1506 to 1509, were based in Wales, Newport Pill, Ebbw Junction & Cardiff Canton, 1508 was withdrawn from that last shed. Like the 1600 and 9400 classes, their construction now appears to have been of doubtful value.\n\nThe onset of dieselisation and the decline in traffic on the railway network consigned the 1500s to scrap long before they were life-expired. However 1501 has enjoyed regular use at the Severn Valley Railway in preservation for far longer than its life in BR ownership.\n\n1501 was one of the first of the class to be withdrawn in 1961, but was sold along with 1502 and 1509 to the National Coal Board for use at Coventry Colliery. The three locos were sent to Andrew Barclay Sons & Co., in Kilmarnock, Scotland for overhaul before delivery to the NCB. All three locomotives were purchased in 1970 by the Severn Valley Railway. Locomotives 1502 and 1509 were used as sources of spares for the restoration of 1501. The remains of 1502 and 1509 were cut up and scrapped at Cashmore's, Great Bridge in October 1970. \n\nIn 2006 No. 1501's boiler certificate expired and it was withdrawn from traffic. The locomotive was overhauled and steamed again in August 2012 and is now in revenue earning service.

For example, one manufacturer gives the shelf life of its pasteurized milk as 12 months. It must be used in conjunction with sterile fill technology (similar to aseptic processing) to prevent post-pasteurization contamination.\n\nThe liquid moves in a controlled, continuous flow while subjected to temperatures of 71.5 °C (160 °F) to 74 °C (165 °F), for about 15 to 30 seconds Followed by rapid cooling from 4 °C (39.2 °F) to 5.5 °C (42 °F).\n\nThe standard US protocol for flash pasteurization of milk, 71.7 °C (161 °F) for 15 seconds in order to kill \"Coxiella burnetii\" (the most heat-resistant pathogenic germ found in raw milk), was introduced in 1933, and results in 5-log reduction (99.999%) or greater reduction in harmful bacteria.

By the time he was 21 years old he had accumulated a prison sentence of 362 years.\n\nLittle is known about Hamilton's childhood. He was born in Oklahoma and raised in Dallas, Texas, where he received his minor public education. He met Clyde Barrow who lived in the same neighborhood when they were boys, and later joined the \"Barrow Gang\". Hamilton was involved in the killing of Deputy Sheriff Eugene C. Moore when Moore and Sheriff Charlie Maxwell became suspicious of the men at an outdoor country dance in Stringtown, Oklahoma. Sheriff Maxwell also sustained six gunshot wounds in the exchange, but survived. It was Barrow's and Hamilton's first murder of a police officer.\n\nHamilton's presence in the group was often problematic, with Clyde Barrow and other members of the gang commonly referring to his girlfriend Mary O'Dare as \"the washerwoman.\" When Hamilton was imprisoned at the Eastham prison farm north of Huntsville, Texas, Bonnie and Clyde raided the farm to free him and four other prisoners on January 16, 1934. One of the other escapees, Joe Palmer, mortally wounded guard M. J. Crowson and caused a series of events which led to Texas Prison System chief Lee Simmons to issue a shoot to kill order against Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. Simmons hired ex-Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, who formed a six-man posse in order to execute this order. Hamilton left the Barrow Gang after a fight about O'Dare and was recaptured on April 25, 1934. He was in prison when Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker were ambushed and killed by Hamer's posse on May 23, 1934.\n\nHamilton was executed on May 10, 1935 at the Texas State Penitentiary, Huntsville, Texas, by electric chair. Hamilton walked calmly and firmly to the chair and seated himself with the words \"Well, goodbye all.\" He was preceded to the electric chair by Joe Palmer.\n\nRaymond Hamilton never publicly admitted killing anyone, although to his brother, Floyd, he admitted that in the case of the killing of Undersheriff Eugene Moore (August 5, 1932, Stringtown, Oklahoma) he was not so sure. \"Clyde and I were both shooting,\" Raymond told Floyd. \"It could have been either one of us. Or both.\" Raymond Hamilton was convicted of the murder of John Bucher of Hillsboro May 1, 1932, though he had nothing to do with it. The actual killer was Ted Rogers. Clyde Barrow and Johnny Russell (not to be confused with \"Uncle Bud\" Russell) were accomplices.\n"}

Wodehouse. First published in the United Kingdom on 27 September 1927 by Herbert Jenkins, and in the United States on 2 March 1928 by Doubleday, Doran. The short stories were originally published in magazines, mainly \"The Strand Magazine\" in the UK and \"Liberty\" in the US.\n\nThe collection introduces the irrepressible pub raconteur Mr. Mulliner, who narrates all nine of the book's stories. The last story, \"Honeysuckle Cottage\", was not originally a Mr. Mulliner story; it was given a Mulliner frame for the book, and is the only one of the stories which is not explicitly narrated from the bar-parlour of the Angler's Rest public house.\n\n\nSee \"The Truth about George\".\n\n\nSee \"A Slice of Life\".\n\n\nSee \"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\".\n\n\nSee \"The Bishop's Move\".\n\n\nA man at the Angler's Rest recounts how his dog won a prize after being mistakenly entered in a local cat show, and notes how mistakes can lead to unexpected good results. Mulliner is inspired to tell the following story, which he claims also shows that you can never tell what will happen in the end and that it is always darkest before the dawn.\n\nMr Mulliner's nephew Lancelot Bassington Mulliner wants to be a poet, though Lancelot's maternal uncle Jeremiah Biggs, the proprietor of Briggs' Breakfast Pickles, wants him to work in the pickle business. Lancelot falls in love with Angela, the beautiful daughter of the Earl of Biddlecombe, who has little money. While they are dancing, Lancelot says he wants to marry her. Angela admires Lancelot's excellent dancing, but her father wants her to marry someone wealthy, so she is thinking of marrying Slingsby Purvis, of Purvis's Liquid Dinner Glue. Hooping to get a job from his uncle, Lancelot writes a poem praising Briggs's pickles for advertising. Lancelot goes to his uncle's Putney house and reads his poem to his uncle. The poem, titled \"Darkling (A Threnody)\", is extremely somber, and Briggs has his butler throw Lancelot out.\n\nLancelot goes to Lord Biddlecombe's residence in Berkeley Square, and asks for Biddlecombe's consent to marry her daughter. Biddlecombe sells some things to Lancelot to make some money, then has his butler throw Lancelot out. A stout man with horn-rimmed spectacles tries to talk to Lancelot, but Lancelot ignores him. Having been unsuccessful with Biggs and Biddlecombe, Lancelot heads to Angela's club, the Junior Lipstick Club (also mentioned in \"The Reverent Wooing of Archibald\"), in order to plead with Angela to marry him even though he is not rich. She is unwilling to marry a poor poet and says she will marry Purvis. She tells the club's hall-porter to throw Lancelot out. Lancelot is dejected, but the stout man with horn-rimmed spectacles from before appears again and knows all about Lancelot's situation because he has read everything in Lancelot's expressive face. The man, Isadore Zinzinheimer, represents a motion picture company in Hollywood and wants to hire Lancelot as an actor since he registers emotion so well. Lancelot no longer loves Angela and happily agrees to go to Hollywood.\n\n\n\nAn American gentleman visits the Angler's Rest. He speaks highly of California, where he is from. Mr Mulliner remarks that California is fine except for the earthquakes. The American asserts that California is perfect and free of earthquakes. Mr Mulliner argues the contrary, and says that his uncle, William Mulliner, experienced the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. He tells the following story about his uncle'x experience, despite the American insisting that what happened in 1906 was only a fire.\n\nWilliam Mulliner loves Myrtle Banks, but she is impressed with the bravery of William's rival, Desmond Franklyn, who claims to have killed sharks and lions. She and Franklyn get engaged. William tries to argue that Franklyn is cruel to animals, but Myrtle is not swayed. William is disappointed, and a hall-porter at the hotel he is staying at suggests he get a drink at a local establishment called Mike's Place. William, until now a teetotaler, follows the hall-porter's advice. He ends up drinking too much and gets thrown out after starting a fight. He falls asleep outside a boarding house for theatrical performers. When he wakes up, he looks inside and sees some unusually small men eating a meal. William, unaware that these men belong to a performing group called Murphy's Midgets, believes he is hallucinating due to the alcohol.\n\nBack at his hotel, William goes to bed. He sees a part of the ceiling fall and hears shouts and crashes, but assumes he is still hallucinating. He falls asleep, and when he wakes up, he sees that the room has in fact largely fallen apart. Myrtle, who was staying at the same hotel, notices William from the exposed hallway and is surprised that he is still in bed. He tells her he noticed the walls falling at night and went to sleep anyway. She calls him the bravest man in the world. She already ended her engagement to Franklyn, who hastily fled when the earthquake started without stopping to help Myrtle. William and Myrtle get married, and name their first son John San Francisco Earthquake Mulliner. \n\n\nMr Mulliner, just returned from visiting his old nanny, remarks that a nanny will always view a boy she looked after as a boy even after he becomes an adult. He tells the following story about his nephew, Frederick Mulliner.\n\nFrederick Mulliner's brother, Dr George Mulliner, wants Frederick to visit their old nanny, 85-year-old Nurse Wilks. Frederick is reluctant, remembering how she once shut him up in a cupboard for stealing jam. George remarks that she is still inclined to be autocratic. However, her heart is weak. For the sake of her health, Frederick must agree to do whatever she wants him to, including eat boiled eggs, though Frederick tries to protest. She has already been visited by George and the Oliphants, who were also looked after by Nurse Wilks as children. Frederick was recently engaged to Jane Oliphant but she ended the engagement without explanation and got engaged to a man named Dillingwater. Frederick arrives at Nurse Wilks's house in Bingley-on-Sea. She initially seems frail, but soon orders Frederick to take off his boots and makes him feel like a small child.\n\nTo Frederick's surprise, Jane Oliphant is at the house. Frederick and Jane argue with each other. Nurse Wilks tells Frederick to apologize to Jane and give her a kiss. He apologizes though he refuses to kiss her. Nurse Wilks orders him to go into the cupboard and stay there until he is good. Frederick hesitates, but he remembers George's warning about Nurse Wilks's heart, so he obeys and goes into the cupboard. Shortly afterward, Jane is sent into the same cupboard for smoking a cigarette. After they argue more, Jane reveals that she ended their engagement because she knew Frederick lied to her about having lunch with another woman. Frederick explains that he was buying the woman's Pekingese dog, which Jane had adored, as a surprise gift for Jane. He still has the dog, which is now in his flat. Jane is delighted. She already broke up with Dillingwater, since she did not love him and only got engaged to him to score off Frederick. They happily embrace. From outside the cupboard, Nurse Wilks asks if Frederick will be good now and kiss Jane. Frederick replies that he will do so, and also bravely faces Nurse Wilks's boiled eggs.\n\n\nMr Mulliner is inspired by a photograph in an illustrated weekly paper to tell the following tale about his cousin Clarence.\n\nThe mayor of Tooting East, Jno. Horatio Biggs, O.B.E., wants aspiring photographer Clarence Mulliner to take his photograph. However, the mayor is ugly and Clarence refuses to take his picture. Clarence makes Biggs leave his studio by prodding him with a tripod, for which Biggs sues him. Clarence's lawyer successfully defends him in court and the jury decides in Clarence's favour. The publicity of the trial makes Clarence a famous and fashionable photographer. Mr Mulliner hears of Clarence's success and visits his studio, but finds Clarence listless and moody. Many beautiful women have had him take their picture and he is now tired of seeing beautiful women. In a traffic jam at the top of Whitehall, Clarence sees a girl in another cab. She does not have a conventionally attractive face. Clarence falls in love with her on sight, but soon the traffic jam clears and she disappears. Clarence is upset about losing her, which makes him seem like a more solemn, profound photographer and enhances his prestige further. The doors of Society open to anyone photographed by him. However, Clarence does not care about his fame and only wants to see the girl in the cab again.\n\nOne night, he is visited by a man with a black mask who claims to be a British agent and asks Clarence to come with him to take a photograph of an important visiting dignitary. Clarence follows him but is kidnapped and tied up. The man in the mask was actually the secretary of Biggs, the Mayor of Tooting East, who had Clarence kidnapped. He has given up on having his own photograph taken by Clarence, but insists that Clarence take his daughter's photograph. Clarence breaks free and is also helped by Biggs's daughter, Gladys, who disapproves of her father kidnapping Clarence. Clarence is stunned to see that she is the girl from the cab. She had also seen Clarence in his cab and loves him. Clarence declares that he will take a photograph of her and her father, which makes the mayor sob with joy. Clarence happily retires from commercial photography. Clarence and Gladys's wedding is attended by many important people and they walk out of church under an arch of crossed tripods.\n\n\nSee \"Honeysuckle Cottage\".\n\nAll the stories, except \"Honeysuckle Cottage\", were illustrated by Charles Crombie in the \"Strand\", and by Wallace Morgan in \"Liberty\".\n\nWodehouse dedicated the book \"To the Earl of Oxford and Asquith\" (H. H. Asquith).\n\n\"The Truth about George\", \"A Slice of Life\", and \"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\" were included in the 1932 collection \"Nothing But Wodehouse\", edited by Ogden Nash and published in New York by Doubleday, Doran & Company. The same three stories were also included in \"The Most of P. G. Wodehouse\", published in October 1960 by Simon and Schuster, New York.\n\nAll of the stories were included in the \"Mulliner Omnibus\", published in October 1935 by Herbert Jenkins Limited. They were also included in \"The World of Mr. Mulliner\", published by Barrie & Jenkins in June 1972 and issued in the US in 1974 by the Taplinger Publishing Company.\n\n\"The Romance of a Bulb-Squeezer\" was included in the 1981 collection \"Wodehouse On Crime\", edited by D. R. Bensen and published by Ticknor & Fields, New York. It was printed in the Northwest Airlines magazine \"Northwest\" in February 1988.\n\n\"The Truth About George\", \"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\", and \"Portrait of a Disciplinarian\" were adapted for television in the series \"Wodehouse Playhouse\" (1974–78).\n\nMultiple Mulliner stories were adapted for radio from 2002 and 2004 with Richard Griffiths as Mr Mulliner, including \"The Truth About George\", \"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\", \"A Slice of Life\", \"The Bishop's Move\", \"Came the Dawn\", and \"Honeysuckle Cottage\".\n\n\n\n"}

Vinh Tra existed until 1954 (however, as North Vietnam never administered the area for a significant period of time, this arrangement was not enforced). In 1957, the South Vietnam formed Vĩnh Long Province, consisting of six districts: Châu Thành, Chợ Lách (now part of Bến Tre Province), Tam Bình, Bình Minh, Sa Đéc, and Lấp Vò. In 1961, Cái Nhum District was split from Chợ Lách. Đức Tôn District and Đức Thành District were added in 1962, but joined the newly formed Sa Đéc Province in 1966. As of 1975, the province had seven districts: Châu Thành, Chợ Lách, Tam Bình, Bình Minh, Minh Đức, Trà Ôn, and Vũng Liêm.\n\nAfter the fall of South Vietnam, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam merged Vĩnh Long with Trà Vinh Province, forming Cửu Long Province in 1976. In 1991, Cửu Long was again split into Vĩnh Long and Trà Vinh. At the time of the split, Vĩnh Long Province consisted of one city (Vĩnh Long) and five districts: Long Hồ, Vũng Liêm, Bình Minh, Tam Bình, and Trà Ôn.\n\nIn 1992, Mang Thít District was re-split from Long Hồ District. In 2007, Bình Tân District was created.\n\nLying between the Hau and Tien rivers in the center of the Mekong Delta, Vĩnh Long is a province well known for fishing.\n\nVĩnh Long is subdivided into eight district-level sub-divisions:\n\n\n\n\nThey are further subdivided into five commune-level towns (or townlets), 94 communes, and 10 wards.\n\nPrawns and the Basa and Tra catfish are among the many types of fish that exist in abundance in the waters of Vĩnh Long. Its rich, fertile soil makes Vĩnh Long an ideal location for the growing of many exotic and delicious fruits, including the strange-looking mangosteen, the spikey rambutan and the pungently fragrant durian. Because of Vĩnh Long's extensive network of waterways, these fruits and many other items can be purchased for mere pennies from the huge water-based squadron of floating merchants.\n\nTraveling by water is a common practice here for such mundane tasks as grocery shopping as well as getting to restaurants and tourist attractions located on small islets accessible only by boat. Tourist infrastructure is still in its infancy here, but comfortable lodging and great food can be had for very reasonable prices.\n\nLocated approximately southwest of Hồ Chí Minh City, Vĩnh Long is easily accessible by bus, van or car using National Route 1A and the Mỹ Thuận Bridge.\n\n"}

Mewati dialect, a slight variant of the Haryanvi and Rajasthani dialects of Hindi, is spoken in rural areas of the region. Mewati Gharana is a distinctive style of Indian classical music.\n\nMeo Muslims of Mewat region, Numbering around 400,000 in 2016, consider themselves to descendants of lord Rama, lord Krishna and Arjuna. They are Hindus who converted to Islam. They practice syncretic Hindu-Muslim religion and celebrate several Hindu festivals such as Holi, Diwali and Dussehra. Their ballads are based on the Hindu epics and their marriage combine both Islamic and Hindu rituals. But due to various social reasons they have moved towards Islam, and are living Muslim life with other communities in harmony \n\nThe title of Wali-e-Mewat was used by the Khanzada Rajput rulers of Mewat State from 1372 till 1527, who ruled Mewat as an independent state. In 1372, Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq granted Raja Nahar Khan of Kotla Fort, the Lordship of Mewat. He established a hereditary polity in Mewat and proclaimed the title of Wali-e-Mewat.

The Meos are the predominant population group and are all agriculturists. Agriculture is mostly rain fed except in small pockets where canal irrigation is available. Agriculture production measured in terms of crop yield per hectare is low in comparison to the other districts of the State. Animal husbandry, particularly dairy, is the secondary source of income for the people and those who live closer to the hilly ranges of Aravali also keep sheep and goats. Milk yields are not so low, however, due to heavy indebtedness most of the farmers are forced to sell the milk to the lenders at lower than normal price, which drastically reduces their income from the milk. Towns like Punhana, Pinangwan, Ferozepur Jhirka, Taoru and Nuh are major hub of retail shops and acts as backbone of day to day life in area.

In the same year of 1945 Cox became the editor of \"Biometrics Bulletin\" and of \"Biometrics\" and she held this editorship for 10 years. In 1947 she was a founder member of the International Biometric Society.\n\nIn 1960 she took up her final post as Director of Statistics at the Research Triangle Institute in Durham, North Carolina. She held this post until she retired in 1965. After retirement, then worked as a consultant to promote the development of statistical programs in Egypt and Thailand.\n\nIn 1950 she published a joint work with William Cochran, \"Experimental Design\", which became the major reference work on the design of experiments for statisticians for years afterwards.\n\nCox received many honors. In 1949 she became the first woman elected into the International Statistical Institute. In 1956 she was elected President of the American Statistical Association while in 1975 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\nShe was also a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.\n\nThe University of North Carolina system named her an O. Max Gardner Award recipient in 1959. North Carolina State University honored Cox by naming Cox Hall in her honor in 1970, and awarding her a Watauga Medal in 1977. The Caucus of Women in Statistics also established a Gertrude M. Cox Scholarship fund in recognition of her work in 1986.\n\n"}
{"id": "2168691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168691", "title": "Shades of Death Road", "text": "Shades of Death Road\n\nShades of Death Road, sometimes referred to locally as just \"Shades\", is a two-lane rural road of about in length in central Warren County, New Jersey. It runs in a generally north-south direction through Liberty and Independence townships, then turns more east-west in Allamuchy Township north of the Interstate 80 (I-80) crossing. South of I-80 it runs alongside Jenny Jump State Forest and offers access to it at several points. The road is the subject of folklore and numerous local legends.\n\nAccording to \"Weird NJ\", these rumors have drawn more visitors to the area, to the annoyance of residents, who have in the past gone so far as to smear the pole holding the street sign (pictured) at the road's southern end with grease or oil to prevent theft (Other signs along the road are in vertical type on poles and thus harder to remove and less desirable to display).\n\nThe road in New Jersey is not the only one with this unusual name. Another Shades of Death Road exists in Washington County, Pennsylvania north of Avella between Bethel Ridge Road and Cole School Road.\n\nShades of Death's southern end is at County Route 611 (CR 611), or Hope Road, in Liberty Township one mile (1.6 km) north of the junction with CR 617 (Mountain Lake Road) and two miles (3.2 km) north of where Hope splits off from U.S. Route 46 (US 46) at Marble Hill, just west of Great Meadows. From that point it meanders along between the base of the Jenny Jump ridge and the low-lying flatlands of the Pequest River valley. About half a mile (almost 1 km) north of the interstate, in Allamuchy, it turns to the east and enters those flatlands, continuing all the while to weave back and forth through some sharp turns, until it reaches its northern terminus at Long Bridge Road.\n\n\"Weird NJ\" suggests several theories for the road's macabre name.\n\nAccording to \"Weird New Jersey\", ghosts or other supernatural phenomena are said to have been reported at points along the road.\n\nGhost Lake (unnamed on U.S. Geological Survey maps) is just off the road, in the state forest south of the I-80 overpass. It was created in the early 20th century when two wealthy local men dammed a creek that ran through the narrow valley between houses they had just built. They gave it its name from the wraithlike vapor formations they often saw rising off it on cooler mornings. They further named the pass Haunted Hollow.\n\n\"Weird NJ\" writes that visitors have told them that no matter what time of night they visit the lake at, the sky above it always seems as bright as if it were still twilight and several have reported ghosts in the area, especially in a deserted old cabin across the lake from the road, supposedly victims of the murders once believed to have given the road its name.\n\nTo the right of Ghost lake, there is a small cave, once used by the Lenape. \"Weird NJ\" says that though the cave is now easily accessible, and also covered in graffiti, archaeologists who surveyed the area in 1918 found pottery shards, flint, and broken arrow heads. From their findings, the archaeologists concluded that \"The Fairy Hole\" was not often visited. It may have been used as a simple resting point for traveling or hunting Lenape, but with its close proximity to several known burial sites, it is said to be a sacred or religiously important site. This survey was conducted before the creation of Ghost Lake.\n\nLenape Lane is an unpaved one-lane dead-end street about three-quarter mile (1.1 km) in length running eastward off Shades just north of I-80. It ends at a farmhouse for which it is little more than a driveway, but halfway down there is space to park or turn around next to a wooden structure described as looking like an abandoned stable.\n\n\"Weird New Jersey\" writes that visitors to this stable site at night have reported extremely local fogs surrounding it and seeing apparitions in it, or sometimes even in clear weather, and also claimed the air is sometimes unusually chilly, and feeling general unease in the area for no immediately apparent reason. An additional legend claims that sometimes nocturnal visitors to Lenape see an orb of white light appear near the end of the road which chases vehicles back out to Shades Of Death, and if it turns red in the process, those who see it will die. This may be due to an old tree near the end of Lenape that was never cut down when the road was built. As a result, the road forks right before the tree, and a big red reflector has been nailed to the tree to warn drivers. Another legend says that if one circles around the tree and drives down the road again at midnight, a red light will shine and the driver will never survive.\n\nThere are some legends concerning a Native American spirit guide who supposedly takes the shape of a deer and appears at various points along the road at night. If drivers see him and do not slow down sufficiently enough to avoid a collision, they will soon get into a serious accident with a deer.\n\nAnother legend tells of a bridge where, if drivers stop past midnight with their high beams on and honk their horns three times, they will see the ghosts of two young children who were run over while playing in the road. This legend actually refers to a bridge over the Flatbrook on Old Mine Road, not far from Shades of Death. The bridge is no longer accessible by car as a newer, larger bridge has been built next to it. The original bridge can still be reached on foot.\n\n\"Weird NJ\" published correspondence from two anonymous readers who said they found hundreds of Polaroid photographs, some of them showing the blurred image of a woman, possibly in distress, scattered in woods just off the road during the 1990s. The magazine claims the local police began an investigation but the photos \"disappeared\" shortly afterward.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168700", "title": "F-algebra", "text": "F-algebra\n\nIn mathematics, specifically in category theory, \"F\"-algebras generalize the notion of algebraic structure. Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of morphisms eliminates all references to quantified elements from the axioms, and these algebraic laws may then be glued together in terms of a single functor \"F\", the \"signature\".\n\n\"F\"-algebras can also be used to represent data structures used in programming, such as lists and trees.\n\nThe main related concepts are initial \"F\"-algebras which may serve to encapsulate the induction principle, and the dual construction \"F\"-coalgebras.\n\nIf C is a category, and \"F\": C → C is an endofunctor of C, then an \"F\"-algebra is a tuple (\"A\", α), where \"A\" is an object of C and α is a C-morphism \"F\"(\"A\") → \"A\". The object \"A\" is called the \"carrier\" of the algebra. When it is permissible from context, algebras are often referred to by their carrier only instead of the tuple.\n\nA homomorphism from an \"F\"-algebra (\"A\", α) to an \"F\"-algebra (\"B\", β) is a C-morphism \"f\": \"A\"→\"B\" such that \"f\" ∘ α = β ∘ \"F\"(\"f\"), according to the following commutative diagram:\n\nEquipped with these morphisms, \"F\"-algebras constitute a category.\n\nThe dual construction are \"F\"-coalgebras, which are objects \"A\" together with a morphism α : \"A\" → \"F\"(\"A\").\n\nClassically, a group is a set \"G\" with a binary operation \"m\" : \"G\" × \"G\" → \"G\", satisfying three axioms: \n\nNote that the closure axiom is included in the symbolic definition of \"m\".\n\nTo treat this in a categorical framework, we first define the identity and inverse as morphisms \"e\" and \"i\" respectively. Let C be an arbitrary category with finite products and a terminal object *. The group \"G\" is an object in C. The morphism \"e\" sends each element in * to 1, the identity element of the group \"G\". The morphism \"i\" sends each element \"x\" in \"G\" to its inverse \"x\", satisfying \"m\"(\"x\", \"x\") = \"m\"(\"x\", \"x\") = 1. Then a group \"G\" can be defined as a 4-tuple (\"G\", \"m\", \"e\", \"i\"), which describes a monoid category with only one object \"G\". Each morphism \"f\" in this monoid category has an inverse \"f\" that satisfies \"f\" ∘ \"f\" = \"f\" ∘ \"f\" = \"Id\".\n\nIt is then possible to rewrite the axioms in terms of morphisms:\n\nThen remove references to the elements of \"G\" (which will also remove universal quantifiers):\n\nWhich is the same as claiming commutativity for the following diagrams:\n\nNow use the coproduct (the disjoint union of sets) to glue the three morphisms in one: α = \"e\" + \"i\" + \"m\" according to\n\nThis defines a group as a \"F\"-algebra where \"F\" is the functor \"F\"(\"G\") = 1 + \"G\" + \"G\" × \"G\".\n\nNote 1: The above construction is used to define group objects over an arbitrary category with finite products and a terminal object *. When the category admits finite coproducts, the group objects are \"F\"-algebras. For example, \nfinite groups are \"F\"-algebras in the category of finite sets and Lie groups are \"F\"-algebras in the category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps.\n\nGoing one step ahead of universal algebra, most algebraic structures are \"F\"-algebras. For example, abelian groups are \"F\"-algebras for the same functor \"F\"(\"G\") = 1 + \"G\" + \"G\"×\"G\" as for groups, with an additional axiom for commutativity: \"m\"∘\"t\" = \"m\", where \"t\"(\"x\",\"y\") = (\"y\",\"x\") is the transpose on \"G\"x\"G\".\n\nMonoids are \"F\"-algebras of signature \"F\"(\"M\") = 1 + \"M\"×\"M\". In the same vein, semigroups are \"F\"-algebras of signature \"F\"(\"S\") = \"S\"×\"S\"\n\nRings, domains and fields are also \"F\"-algebras with a signature involving two laws +,•: \"R\"×\"R\" → R, an additive identity 0: 1 → \"R\", a multiplicative identity 1: 1 → \"R\", and an additive inverse for each element -: \"R\" → \"R\". As all these functions share the same codomain \"R\" they can be glued into a single signature function 1 + 1 + \"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\" → \"R\", with axioms to express associativity, distributivity, and so on. This makes rings \"F\"-algebras on the category of sets with signature 1 + 1 + \"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\" + \"R\"×\"R\".\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the functor \"F\"(\"R\") = 1 + \"R\"×\"R\" in the category of abelian groups. In that context, the multiplication is a homomorphism, meaning \"m\"(\"x\" + \"y\", \"z\") = \"m\"(\"x\",\"z\") + \"m\"(\"y\",\"z\") and \"m\"(\"x\",\"y\" + \"z\") = \"m\"(\"x\",\"y\") + \"m\"(\"x\",\"z\"), which are precisely the distributivity conditions. Therefore, a ring is an \"F\"-algebra of signature 1 + \"R\"×\"R\" over the category of abelian groups which satisfies two axioms (associativity and identity for the multiplication).\n\nWhen we come to vector spaces and modules, the signature functor includes a scalar multiplication \"k\"×\"E\" → \"E\", and the signature \"F\"(\"E\") = 1 + \"E\" + \"k\"×\"E\" is parametrized by \"k\" over the category of fields, or rings.\n\nAlgebras over a field can be viewed as \"F\"-algebras of signature 1 + 1 + \"A\" + \"A\"×\"A\" + \"A\"×\"A\" + \"k\"×\"A\" over the category of sets, of signature 1 + \"A\"×\"A\" over the category of modules (a module with an internal multiplication), and of signature \"k\"×\"A\" over the category of rings (a ring with a scalar multiplication), when they are associative and unitary.\n\nNot all mathematical structures are \"F\"-algebras. For example, a poset \"P\" may be defined in categorical terms with a morphism \"s\":\"P\" × \"P\" → Ω, on a subobject classifier (Ω = {0,1} in the category of sets and \"s\"(\"x\",\"y\")=1 precisely when \"x\"≤\"y\"). The axioms restricting the morphism \"s\" to define a poset can be rewritten in terms of morphisms. However, as the codomain of \"s\" is Ω and not \"P\", it is not an \"F\"-algebra.\n\nHowever, lattices in which every two elements have a supremum and an infimum, and in particular total orders, are \"F\"-algebras. This is because they can equivalently be defined in terms of the algebraic operations: \"x\"∨\"y\" = inf(\"x\",\"y\") and \"x\"∧\"y\" = sup(\"x\",\"y\"), subject to certain axioms (commutativity, associativity, absorption and idempotency). Thus they are \"F\"-algebras of signature \"P\" x \"P\" + \"P\" x \"P\". It is often said that lattice theory draws on both order theory and universal algebra.\n\nConsider the functor formula_2 that sends a set formula_3 to formula_4. Here, formula_5 denotes the category of sets, formula_6 denotes the usual coproduct given by the disjoint union, and formula_7 is a terminal object (i.e. any singleton set). Then, the set formula_8 of natural numbers together with the function formula_9—which is the coproduct of the functions formula_10 and formula_11—is an \"F\"-algebra.\n\nIf the category of \"F\"-algebras for a given endofunctor \"F\" has an initial object, it is called an initial algebra. The algebra formula_12 in the above example is an initial algebra. Various finite data structures used in programming, such as lists and trees, can be obtained as initial algebras of specific endofunctors.\n\nTypes defined by using least fixed point construct with functor \"F\" can be regarded as an initial \"F\"-algebra, provided that parametricity holds for the type.\n\nSee also Universal algebra.\n\nIn a dual way, a similar relationship exists between notions of greatest fixed point and terminal \"F\"-coalgebra. These can be used for allowing potentially infinite objects while maintaining strong normalization property. In the strongly normalizing Charity programming language (i.e. each program terminates in it), coinductive data types can be used achieving surprising results, e.g. defining lookup constructs to implement such “strong” functions like the Ackermann function.\n\n\n\n"}

In one instance, the ADA entered into contract with InfoCision, a telemarketing firm that works closely with nonprofits, whereby only 15% of the expected funds raised would be given to the ADA with the other 85% being kept by the telemarketing firm. Furthermore, the telemarketers were instructed to lie to prospective donors regarding how much of their donation will go to the ADA.\n\nThe ADA works with experts to publish a variety of informational books, magazines and journals for both medical professionals and consumers including \"Diabetes Forecast\" magazine ().\n\nThe ADA was founded in 1939 by six leading physicians − including Dr. Herman O. Mosenthal, Dr. Joseph T. Beardwood Jr., Dr. Joseph H. Barach, and Dr. E. S. Dillion − at their 1939 meeting of the American College of Physicians. \n\nIn September 1946, they hosted a meeting in Toronto, Canada to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the discovery of insulin. The meeting served as a successful forum for hundreds of physicians and leading figures interested in the studies of diabetes and carbohydrate metabolism. The organization is now a national nonprofit with 40 affiliate organizations, more than 800 individual chapters, over a million volunteers, and almost 1,000 staff members − including officer and a board of directors.\n\nIn 2017, the ADA's total revenue was $150 million − approximately 70% of which was from corporate and private contributions and grants while the remaining 30% from sales and investments. In addition, the ADA also encourages supporters to organize “Do-It-Yourself” fundraisers in the form of local events, such as a game night or community walk.\n\nIn 2017, the ADA spent $49 million on research, $49 million on information, $31 million on advocacy and public awareness, $10.7 million on management, and $35.8 million on fundraising.\n\nThe ADA aims to give individuals with diabetes access to the care they need to optimize their health. To work towards achieving this mission, the organization places effort into funding research projects that help minority groups navigate diabetes. The ADA works with various colleges, local governments, and companies to promote healthy lifestyles. They also fund research looking to control risk factors associated with diabetes, as seen in a recently published article discussing the role of microglia immune cells in diet-induced obesity.\n\nThe ADA has had several accomplishments in the policy arena, including gathering advocates at Call to Congress (a lobbying event on Capitol Hill) to raise awareness for ADA's legislative priorities, calling for regulations on insulin prices, and helping to improve Medicare's coverage policy for the National Diabetes Prevention Program. On the legal front, the ADA has supported appellate litigation regarding employer discrimination of employees with diabetic conditions, including cases involving both government employers (\"Atkins v. Salazar\") and private companies (\"Darnell v. Thermafiber\").\n\nThe ADA has provided diabetes education to the workforce of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), raised funding for diabetes prevention programs throughout the United States, and taken steps to prevent diabetes discrimination through developing materials on the care of students with diabetes to be used in educational institutions. Additionally, the ADA holds events for local diabetic community, including programs such as \"Step Out\" that support walk events to stop diabetes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168709", "title": "Point Lobos Ranch", "text": "Point Lobos Ranch\n\nPoint Lobos Ranch is an parcel of land in the northern region of Big Sur, California, United States. It is owned by the California State Park System which since acquiring the land in 2001 has stated that the land is being held for possible use as a state park.\n\nPoint Lobos Ranch is located south of Carmel by the Sea and east of Point Lobos State Reserve. It contains one of the world's largest stands of native Monterey Pines, endangered Gowen cypress, and rare maritime chaparral plant community.\n\nThe Ohlone people harvested shellfish including abalone from the waters around Point Lobos. Evidence has been found of seasonal camp sites on the San Jose Creek for about 2,500 years. The village, named Ichxenta, was occupied until the end of the Carmel Mission era, when the native population was decimated by disease and forced assimilation. In about 1770, Spanish Vaqueros from the nearby Carmel Mission ran cattle on Point Lobos.\n\nGovernor Juan Alvarado granted two square leagues of land named Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito in 1839 to Marcelino Escobar. It was briefly owned in turn by Doňa Maria Josefa de Abrego, who may have held it for her husband, Monterey Alcalde José Abrego. In 1843, Doňa Abrego deeded the land to a group of about 10 soldiers from the Monterey Presidio. It appears that the soldiers paid nothing, and a legend attached to the transfer says a gambler lost a rancho in a card game. On June 7, 1844, the soldiers turned the Rancho over to their superior officer, Colonel José Castro, former Governor Alvarado's brother-in-law.\n\nWhen Mexico ceded California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. But the Land Act of 1851 required owners to prove their ownership, and Castro filed a claim for Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito with the Public Land Commission in on February 2, 1853. While waiting for his case to be decided, Castro sold his 8,876 acres of land in 1854 to Joseph S. Emery and Abner Bassett for $700, leaving to them the legal fight for ownership. The litigation lasted for 38 years, during which thirty-two others eventually asserted that they owned a portion of the land. Thirty-five years later, in 1886, Castro's successors finally obtained clear title, forcing all other claimants out.\n\nIn 1874, a seam of low grade bituminous coal was found in upper Malpaso Canyon. On September 6, 1888, shortly after the patent for Rancho San Jose y Sur Chiquito was approved, almost all of the claimants banded together to form the Carmelo Land and Coal Company. But by 1896, the coal mine was unprofitable.\n\nIn 1862, Antonio Victorine, a Portuguese whaler from the Azores, arrived at Point Lobos, following the whale population. Other whaler's from the Azores followed him. Some built cabins on land east of Point Lobos, and old houses on the ranch property still bear Portuguese names, like Victorine and Morales.\n\nAlexander MacMillan Allan, a successful race track architect and real estate developer from Pennsylvania, purchased 640 acres of Point Lobos from the Carmelo Land and Coal Company in 1898. He preserved Point Lobos and established the Point Lobos Dairy at the mouth of San Jose Creek which was operated from 1903 until 1954.\n\nThe land was acquired by the Big Sur Land Trust in 1993 for $4.25 million. It held onto the land until 2003, when it sold the land to California State Park System for $3 million in funds from Proposition 117 funds and a $1 million grant from the Coastal Conservancy. Although owned by a public agency and purchased with public funds, the public is not allowed to access the property.\n\nPoint Lobos Ranch was seen in an episode of Bay Area Backroads.\n\n"}

It features the voice acting of Bruce Campbell as main character Jake Logan in a 3-D space simulator. Tachyon was developed by Randy Casey, who had previously written two other titles for Novalogic: \"F-22 Lightning II\" and \"F-22 Raptor\".\n\nThe story of \"Tachyon: The Fringe\" is set in the 26th century, where mankind has left Earth to colonize the far reaches of space, and has many characteristics of a space opera. The Sol system is a place of relative peace, which is kept by the police force called Star Patrol. Out on the Fringe where Star Patrol has little presence megacorporations, pirate clans and colonist groups clash, frequently violently.\n\nYou take the role of Jake Logan, a mercenary fighter pilot working comfortably in the Sol system. Early in the campaign you are framed for the terrorist bombing of a starbase and are exiled to the Fringe, barred forever from your home. The primary conflict in the Fringe is between the Galactic Span (GalSpan) corporation and the Bora colonists for mining rights in the Fringe, and they each offer a new start. The Bora want to declare independence in the Bora sector, threatening GalSpan's profits in the region.\n\nIf the player sides with the Bora, they fight to stymy the \"Spanner\" attempts to demoralise and displace the Bora, and sabotage GalSpan operations. After many setbacks, Jake overcomes overwhelming odds to destroy the massive new Hephaestus mining station live in front of the Tachyon News Service, humiliating GalSpan and tanking their share price, forcing them to shut down their operations in the fringe and leave the Bora alone.\n\nGalSpan meanwhile offers the chance to work for them, defending GalSpan interests and destroying Bora \"terrorists\". After many successes GalSpan completes their new Hephaestus station, causing the Bora to launch an all-out assault, which Jake defeats. Jake then escorts the defecting Bora leader to the GalSpan side, who urges the Bora to abandon their homes in the face of the unstoppable GalSpan to resettle further out in the frontier.\n\nTachyon: The Fringe is a first-person space combat simulator. Among several features, (such as power and shield management), the game implements \"sliding\", where the player can maintain a constant velocity while having free control over the orientation of their spacecraft. This is intended to provide an ease-of-motion where the player can strafe, fly backwards and otherwise maintain a higher level of control over their spacecraft.\n\nIn story mode, the player chooses missions from the Job Board. Some missions are offered by neutral parties and do not drive the main storyline (though they do occasionally affect the TNS News bulletins). Eventually, the story will reach a point where it becomes necessary for the player to ally with either the Bora Colonies or the Galactic Spanning Corporation. The Bora missions are usually higher in difficulty and less rewarding monetarily. GalSpan pays well and often has missions in tandem with other pilots. Since the two factions offer different fighters and different weapons, they encourage different play styles, as well as different storylines. The GalSpan missions generally are higher paid than the Bora ones, and the Bora missions tend to get more difficult in the end.\n\nKevin Rice reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"This is a solid space-simulation game; it just doesn't offer much in the way of anything new.\"\n\nAccording to Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter, \"Tachyon: The Fringe\" was a commercial flop, with sales of 20,385 copies and revenues of $778,095 in the United States by July 2000. He cited this performance as part of a trend of falling sales for space flight simulators and the wider flight simulator genre.\n\nThe editors of \"Computer Games Magazine\" nominated \"Tachyon\" for their 2000 \"Sci-Fi Simulation of the Year\" award.\n\n\n"}
