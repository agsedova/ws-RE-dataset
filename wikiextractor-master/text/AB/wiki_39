He is the drummer and backing vocalist for the rock band Coldplay.\n\nWilliam Raymond Champion was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England, and was brought up in the Highfield suburb of the city, close to the University of Southampton, where his father, Timothy Champion, is a professor of archaeology; his mother, Sara Champion, was also an archaeologist.\n\nAs a youth, Champion's musical influences included Tom Waits, Nick Cave and traditional Irish folk music. He learned to play piano and violin when he was 8 and he learned to play the guitar when he was 12. He also has experience on the bass, and tin whistle. Before he joined Coldplay, Champion performed in a band called Fat Hamster.\n\nChampion attended primary school at Portswood Primary School, secondary school at Cantell Maths and Computing College, and college at Peter Symonds College. He attended Highfield Church. As a youngster he also played cricket for Chandler's Ford CC along with his older brother. He studied anthropology at University College London, where he met his future bandmates.\n\nEnglish comedian Ricky Gervais is Champion's former boss.\n\nChampion was the last of the four band members to join the ensemble on 31 July 1997. He took up the position as drummer with no prior experience, but quickly adjusted to fill the role. In 1999, lead singer Chris Martin sacked Champion, but the band asked him to return soon after. His previous experience on other instruments has been praised by Martin: \"Will is like a human jukebox. He knows more songs than anyone. You name it, he'll play it.\"\n\nIn Coldplay, Champion is often regarded as the rationality of the band. They say of him: \"Will does have a very sensible head on his shoulders and when it comes to making band decisions he's really good at putting valid points across and keeping everyone focused. He frequently has the casting vote and his decision can sometimes override the consensus!\" As Chris Martin has said in multiple interviews, \"We [Coldplay] are all just working for Will Champion.\"\n\nWhile all four members have sung backing vocals, Champion has been the most prominent. During the Viva la Vida Tour, Champion sang and performed an acoustic version of the song \"Death Will Never Conquer\". A version of the song was included on Coldplay's live album \"LeftRightLeftRightLeft\". He has also performed lead vocals on the \"Life in Technicolor II\" B-side \"The Goldrush\", on a live version of \"Til Kingdom Come\" and on the live version of \"In My Place\" performed during the A Head Full of Dreams Tour and included in \"Live in Buenos Aires\".\n\nIn the autumn of 2004, Champion and Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman guested on A-ha keyboardist Magne Furuholmen's first solo album \"Past Perfect Future Tense\". Champion made a cameo appearance in \"The Rains of Castamere,\" an episode of the HBO series \"Game of Thrones,\" where he portrayed a musician during the Red Wedding.\n\nChampion's mother, Sara, a doctor of prehistoric archaeology, died from cancer in 2000. The album \"Parachutes\" was dedicated to her. In 2003, Champion became the first Coldplay member to marry after becoming engaged to Marianne Dark, a teacher. The first child of the couple, a girl named Ava, was born on 28 April 2006. On 7 May 2008, Marianne gave birth to fraternal twins Juno and Rex. Champion is a lifelong fan of Southampton F.C. and has had a season ticket for many years.\n\nAccording to an article released by Quartz in May 2018, Champion has an estimated wealth of £82 million.\n\nChampion currently uses a Yamaha drum kit with Zildjian cymbals. In the music video for \"Christmas Lights\", he uses a \"Slingerland\" drumkit and Ludwig Supraphonic Snare 14x6.5 inches. For sticks, Champion looks to Pro-Mark's American Hickory 5A stick with a wooden tip.\n\nIt wasn't until A Head Full Of Dreams Tour (which started in March 2016 and concluded in November 2017) that Champion owned his own drum kit, as all the other drum kits he used were either from the band or from the company.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963588", "title": "Goobacks", "text": "Goobacks\n\n\"Goobacks\" is the seventh episode of the eighth season of the animated television series \"South Park\", and the 118th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 28, 2004.\n\nIn the episode, people from a poverty-stricken future year of 3045 travel back in time to find work, via a recently discovered time portal. When the boys try to earn some extra money, the time-traveling immigrants are willing to do the same work for next to nothing, causing the boys to lose their jobs. This affects the town's economy and the employment of the original occupants.\n\n\"Goobacks\" serves as a satire of illegal immigration, and mocks both sides of the debate concerning it. The episode is widely remembered as the origin of the catchphrase \"\"They took our jobs!\"\".\n\nEarly in the morning, a mysterious man appears in South Park, entering from some kind of portal. Unfamiliar with his surroundings, he is hit lightly by a car. After shovelling snow, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny watched a report on CNN about the mysterious arrival. The mysterious person, who has come from over a thousand years in the future, is looking for work because of the overpopulation and poverty in his time, and he learns that the money that he earns in the 21st century will be enough to feed his family in 3045. Soon enough, large numbers of immigrants begin to come through the portal. The future people are described by CNN as \"a hairless, uniform mix of all races\" with the same skin color, while their language is a guttural mixture of all world languages; also, the immigrants are referred to as \"Goobacks\" due to having some kind of goo attached to them after exiting the portal (a satire of the modern slur \"Wetbacks\" referring to Mexican immigrants). As the boys return to offer to shovel snow again the next day, they find that the newly arrived time-immigrants have shoveled all driveways on the street for very low pay. As the immigrants are willing to accept jobs for that kind of pay, the original workers throughout South Park are replaced, thus resulting in massive unemployment throughout the town.\n\nAt a meeting to discuss their concern with the Goobacks, construction worker Darryl Weathers complains that they have worked hard to get their pay high enough to make a living, but now are being ousted by the time-immigrants. The other workers voice their own complaints, with each sentence finishing off with an increasingly slurred and garbled exclamation of \"They took our jobs!\", which later becomes their slogan. Later at that meeting, Weathers has the audience suggest ideas for stopping the immigrants from arriving at the town. One man suggests everyone start stripping and engaging in a gay orgy; Weathers likes the idea, as it is the only way to stop the immigrants from coming because homosexual couples cannot spawn offspring. The protesters reluctantly agree with the exception of Jimbo Kern; and begin the orgy.\n\nMeanwhile, Stan's father Randy - despite initially being sympathetic to the Goobacks - loses his job to a Gooback and becomes the spokesperson of the protesters. Randy is interviewed by CNN while still naked. Next to him is a very embarrassed and disturbed Stan, who explains that he understands that the immigrants are living in poverty and they are just trying to get by, but realizes that poor societies often hurt other societies instead of helping them. He suggests that the people of the present should try to make the future better so the immigrants will not need to come. The entire town begins to recycle, install solar and wind power devices, plant trees, give to the poor, etc., hoping to cause the Goobacks to disappear. Although the townspeople's efforts are successful and the Goobacks begin to fade away, the boys observe that the work is \"gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other\", and with an exclamation of \"We're sorry, back in the pile!\", the male adults including the boys happily resume their orgy.\n\n\"Goobacks\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.\n\n"}

{"id": "1963613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963613", "title": "WBAL-TV", "text": "WBAL-TV\n\nWBAL-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 11, is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is the flagship station of the Hearst Television subsidiary of Hearst Communications (founded by newspaper chain titan William Randolph Hearst), and is co-owned with the company's sole radio properties, WBAL (1090 AM) and WIYY (97.9 FM). The three stations share studios and offices on \"Television Hill\" in the Woodberry section of Baltimore, west of the Jones Falls stream valley, near the landmark \"candleabra\" transmission tower that WBAL-TV also shares with WIYY and several other Baltimore TV and radio broadcast outlets.\n\nOn cable, WBAL-TV is carried on Comcast Xfinity channels 21 (standard definition) and 811 (high definition). On Verizon FiOS, DirecTV and Dish Network and in most outlying areas of the market, the station is carried on channel 11.\n\nWBAL-TV began operations on Channel 11 on March 11, 1948, from its original studios on North Charles Street in Downtown Baltimore. It was the second station in Baltimore, signing on five months after WMAR-TV on Channel 2 in October 1947, and eight months ahead of WAAM-TV (now WJZ-TV) on Channel 13 later that year. The station's parent, the Hearst Corporation (founded by newspaper chain syndicate titan William Randolph Hearst, 1863-1951 of San Francisco and New York City) also owned WBAL radio and two local newspapers, the largest circulation in town, the afternoon daily \"\"Baltimore News-Post\"\" (and \"\"The Baltimore American\"\" on Sundays - which later merged as the \"News American\" in 1965 before shutting down in 1986, as one of the city's later then three daily papers). \n\nWBAL-TV is one of two Hearst-owned broadcast properties to have been built and signed on by the company (the other being WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh), and the oldest to be continuously owned by Hearst through its various television subsidiaries through the years. At its launch, WBAL-TV was an NBC affiliate, owing to its radio sister's long affiliation with the NBC Red Network.\n\nEarly programming on channel 11 included \"Musical Almanac\", \"Look and Cook\" and \"Know Baltimore\", along with news and sports productions. In the 1950s, the station introduced \"Romper Room\", a children's program produced locally by Bert and Nancy Claster that eventually became a nationally franchised and syndicated program. Another long-running show of the 1950s was the weekday \"Quiz Club\", co-hosted by local personalities Brent Gunts and Jay Grayson. \"Baltimore Sun\" local history columnist Jacques Kelly described it at the time of Grayson's death in June 2000, as \"pure 1950s live television ... executed on a low budget ... the genial hosts ... ruled the 1 p.m. airwaves\".\n\nWBAL-TV produced several local bowling shows in the 1960s and early 1970s, including \"Strikes and Spares\", \"Pinbusters\", \"Duckpins and Dollars\", \"Bowling for Dollars\" and \"Spare Time\". The station even went as far as building and installing several \"duckpin\" bowling alleys at its studios. It also launched several children's entertainment shows during this period, such as \"Rhea and Sunshine\", \"Pete the Pirate\", \"P.W. Doodle\", \"Heads Up\", and the teen-oriented rock and roll music and the mid 1960s teen dancing on the \"Kerby Scott Show\" which introduced its \"mod\" fashions and \"hippie\" culture style of rock music to the area. \n\nWBAL-TV has boasted many television firsts, including becoming the first Baltimore television station to broadcast in color, the first station in Maryland (and the eighth in the world) to acquire a videocassette machine (of the U-Matic format); the first station in Baltimore to acquire a mobile satellite news-gathering system (dubbed \"NEWSTAR 11\") and the first Baltimore station to hire an African-American news anchor and a Black news director.\n\nIn the late 1970s, ABC steadily rose in the ratings to become the number one network in primetime. Accordingly, the network began to seek upgrades to its slate of affiliates, which included some stations that either had poor signals or poorly performing local programming. WBAL-TV had been invited to switch to ABC in 1977, but opted to remain with NBC out of concerns about the poor ratings for ABC's then-recently revamped evening newscasts.\nOn March 3, 1981, CBS announced that it would be ending its 33-year affiliation with WMAR-TV (channel 2), then owned by the A. S. Abell Company (then-publishers of the \"Baltimore Sun\"), and moving its programming to WBAL-TV. Among its reasons for making the switch, CBS cited channel 11's strength in local news ratings and overall non-network programming as opposed to WMAR-TV, which heavily preempted the network in favor of syndicated programs, local public affairs and sports coverage; CBS also cited low ratings for WMAR's newscasts. WBAL-TV's first stint as an NBC affiliate ended on August 30, 1981, when the two station exchanged networks–the first affiliation swap to occur in Baltimore. The last NBC program to air on channel 11 until 1995 was a rerun from the evening before the switch of the first episode of \"Saturday Night Live\", with host George Carlin.\n\nOn June 16, 1994, the E. W. Scripps Company, present owners of WMAR-TV, negotiated with ABC to affiliate with its Baltimore station as part of a multi-station deal. ABC agreed to the deal as a condition of retaining its affiliations with WXYZ-TV in Detroit and WEWS-TV in Cleveland; CBS was seeking to affiliate with both of those stations, as it was about to lose its affiliates in Detroit and Cleveland to Fox in a separate affiliation deal with New World Communications. One month later, CBS and Westinghouse Broadcasting formed a partnership which renewed the network's affiliations with Westinghouse-owned stations in Pittsburgh and San Francisco and caused WJZ-TV (channel 13, Baltimore's longtime ABC affiliate) and two other Westinghouse-owned NBC affiliates to switch their affiliations to CBS (Westinghouse would eventually acquire CBS in November 1995). Largely by default, channel 11 rejoined NBC on January 2, 1995. The final CBS program to air on channel 11 before it rejoined NBC was the made-for-TV movie \"A Father for Charlie\" at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time; this was directly preceded by an hour-long program explaining the switch, which preempted an airing of the \"Chicago Hope\" episode \"Heartbreak\" (which could still be viewed in much of the market via WUSA).\n\nThe station was a prominent feature in the 1982 movie \"Diner\", set in Baltimore. One of the main characters' girlfriends worked at the station, and another character watches \"College Bowl\", an NBC program that aired on WBAL-TV. It was also the primary setting for the 1991 film \"He Said, She Said\", in which two newspaper columnists for the \"Baltimore Sun\" (Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Perkins) serve as hosts of a fictional opinion/debate program on the station.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWBAL-TV carries a digital subchannel on 11.2, which launched in August 2005 as \"11 Insta-Weather Plus\", an affiliate of NBC Weather Plus until the network dissolved in November 2008; after that, the subchannel carried automated local and regional weather information provided by NBC Plus until April 2009, when an alternate programming format was adopted featuring local weather information, newscasts and other special programming. On March 5, 2012, WBAL launched a 10 p.m. newscast on the subchannel (which was renamed \"WBAL Plus\" the previous year).\n\nOn July 24, 2012, Hearst Television renewed its affiliation agreement with MeTV through 2015, to maintain existing affiliations with eight Hearst-owned stations that were already carrying the digital multicast network. As part of the renewal, Hearst also signed agreements to add the network as digital subchannels of WBAL-TV and four other Hearst stations in Sacramento, Boston, Oklahoma City and Greensboro. MeTV was added to subchannel 11.2 on September 10, 2012.\n\nWBAL-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 59, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era assignment of VHF channel 11. Several VHF digital stations received permission for a power increase later that month after stations experienced signal problems as a result of changing their digital channel from UHF to VHF. WBAL-TV chose to test its equipment before making a commitment.\n\nAs a part of the repacking process following the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction, WBAL-TV will relocate to VHF channel 12 on May 1, 2020, using PSIP to display its virtual channel number as 11. After the switch, WJZ-TV will then use channel 11 as their new VHF digital channel.\n\nOutside of the NBC network schedule, syndicated programs seen on WBAL-TV include \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"The Dr. Oz Show\", \"Inside Edition\", \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" and \"Access\", which is distributed by NBC's sister company NBCUniversal Television Distribution. WBAL-TV is one of the few NBC affiliates that does not air the fourth hour of \"Today\" (which can be seen in the area via NBC O&O WRC-TV in Washington).\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, channel 11 preempted an hour of the network's daytime schedule everyday, as well as half of its Saturday morning cartoon lineup. Channel 11 also did not run CBS' late night programming. Baltimore viewers who wanted to see the entire CBS lineup could be able to view those programs through WDVM-TV/WUSA in Washington, which was available over-the-air in most of the adjacent Baltimore area and preempted little network programming.\n\nIn 1970, when the then-Baltimore Colts moved to the newly-formed and realigned American Football Conference as part of the AFL–NFL merger of professional football of 1970, WBAL-TV displaced WMAR-TV (which had aired most of the team's games since 1956) as the station of record for the team (as NBC was the rightsholder for all AFC games). During its first season as such, the station provided coverage of the Colts' victory in Super Bowl V in 1971. This partnership continued until 1981, when WMAR-TV became the team's unofficial home station again for their last three seasons in Baltimore (although the station continued to air Colts games in those three seasons, they were limited to home interconference contests). When the reorganized Baltimore Ravens began play in 1996 after moving the old Cleveland Browns franchise to Maryland, WBAL-TV became the new team's station of record, but only for two seasons; in 1998, most games were moved to WJZ-TV. Presently, WBAL-TV airs any Ravens games when they play on NBC's Sunday Night Football.\n\nThe station aired any Baltimore Orioles baseball games as part of NBC's broadcast contract with Major League Baseball from the establishment of the new Orioles franchise in 1954 (move of the old St. Louis Browns to the city) until 1981; it also aired all of the Orioles' postseason games through NBC's limited contract from 1995 to 2000. During its time as a CBS station, WBAL-TV also broadcast select games involving the Orioles through CBS's MLB broadcast contract from 1990 to 1993.\n\nWBAL-TV presently broadcasts 35 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday, 4½ hours on Saturdays and 5½ hours on Sundays); the station also produces a weekly public affairs program on Sunday mornings called \"11 TV Hill\".\n\nAppropriately for a station with roots in a newspaper, channel 11 has a rich news tradition. WBAL's newscasts have spent the better part of its history in either first or second place in the ratings. It led the ratings from the 1960s until WJZ-TV passed it in the early 1970s. However, for the better part of the last 40 years, WBAL-TV had waged a spirited battle for first place in the ratings with WJZ-TV. In recent years, WBAL-TV's newscasts placed first at 5, 6 and 11 p.m. However, in the November 2009 Nielsen ratings sweeps period—the first since the debut of \"The Jay Leno Show\"—WBAL's 11 p.m. newscast fell precipitously from first to a distant second behind WJZ (by contrast, the 11 p.m. newscast on WRC-TV in nearby Washington, D.C. was one of the least affected late-night newscasts of any NBC affiliate or owned-and-operated station in the country; it continued to dominate its competitors). WBAL still continued to lead at 5 and 6 p.m. until the November 2011 sweeps period. Since NBC took Leno off of primetime in February 2010—in part due to complaints from WBAL and other affiliates about effects on its newscasts—viewership of channel 11's late newscast has often come close to the WJZ newscast. However, since the November 2011 sweeps period, WJZ's newscasts took the lead in nearly all time slots but WBAL is still a strong second.\n\nIn 1974, WBAL introduced the \"Action News\" format to Baltimore. Characterized by short, usually 90 second, news \"packages\" and upbeat introductory news themes, Baltimore's \"Action News\" briefly replaced WJZ as the number one news station in Baltimore during the mid-1970s. The architect of the success was news director Ron Kershaw, who had come to Baltimore from Texas and was considered somewhat ahead of his time. He brought in talented anchors like Sue Simmons and Spencer Christian but also replaced long-time local news anchor Rolf Hertsgaard with controversial out-of-towner Don Harrison and streamlined the news operation. Kershaw later brought other innovations to WNBC-TV in New York City and WBBM-TV in Chicago as news director at those stations.\n\nWBAL-TV lent then-meteorologist Sandra Shaw to Hearst sister station WDSU-TV in New Orleans on September 1, 2008, to assist with the Louisiana station's coverage of Hurricane Gustav.\n\nOn January 3, 2009, WBAL-TV became the second station in Baltimore (behind WBFF-TV) to begin broadcasting its local news programming in high definition. Only the in-studio cameras and footage from the station's helicopter were in HD at the time of the switch. For over a year, most field reports were still in pillarboxed standard definition. Most field reports are switched from widescreen enhanced definition to 16:9 high definition in March 2012. On March 5, 2012, WBAL debuted a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast on its WBAL Plus digital subchannel, which competes against an hour-long newscast on WBFF.\n\nOn January 12, 2015, WBAL-TV expanded their morning newscast \"11 News Today\" to 4:30 a.m.\n\nNews Anchor Rod Daniels retired from WBAL-TV in 2015 after more than 30 years with the station.\n\nIn addition, WBAL-TV became the first Baltimore television station to win a Peabody Award for local news coverage, specifically of their Chesapeake Bay pollution investigation (and the first Baltimore television station to win the award in any category in more than fifty years). WBAL's news department was also awarded as one of the top three Best Television Newscasts by the National Headliners Association, alongside WFAA-TV in Dallas, and WBAL's Boston sister station WCVB-TV. The station has also won regional Edward R. Murrow Awards, the George Polk Award and the American Bar Association Gavel Award for excellence in reporting and journalism; it has also been rated the most outstanding television news operation in Baltimore (by the Associated Press and United Press International).\n\n\n\nOutside of the Baltimore market, WBAL-TV can be seen on Maryland's Eastern Shore from Dorchester County to Worcester County, and Sussex County, Delaware. Both Comcast and Mediacom systems in the Salisbury, Maryland/Dover, Delaware market carry WBAL-TV along with that market's NBC affiliate, WRDE-LD (Comcast's system in Sussex County, Delaware carries both WRDE-LD and WBAL-TV, as well as NBC's Philadelphia owned-and-operated station WCAU). \n\nWBAL-TV is also viewed in many parts of southern Pennsylvania such as Gettysburg in Adams County, and Hanover and York as well as the majority of York County due to its proximity to Baltimore. In Lancaster County, WBAL is only available in Marietta, Columbia, and Elizabethtown mainly because of competition and prevalence of Philadelphia and local television stations in the area that are more well-known such as WGAL and WCAU.\n\nIn Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, WBAL-TV can be seen in Frederick, Clarke and Warren counties along with the independent city of Winchester.\n\nThe station also live streams its newscasts on the internet several times a day.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963626", "title": "Monmouth School", "text": "Monmouth School\n\nMonmouth School is an independent boys' boarding and day school in Monmouth, Wales. The school was founded in 1614 with a bequest from William Jones, a successful merchant and trader. The School is run as a trust, the William Jones's Schools Foundation, by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers, one of the livery companies, and has close links to its sister school, Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls. In 2018, the Haberdashers renamed their group of schools in the town, the Monmouth Schools, and made corresponding changes to the names of the boys' and girls' schools.\n\nThe school is situated on the eastern edge of the border town of Monmouth, adjacent to the River Wye. Nothing of the original school buildings from the 17th century remains as the school was completely rebuilt in the mid to late 19th century. Later developments have included the Science Block (1981–1984) and the William Jones Building of the early 21st century (2014). In 2014, the quatercentenary of the school's foundation was celebrated with a service at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nEstablished originally as a grammar school, by the early 1870s Monmouth was a member of the recently formed Headmasters' Conference and had acquired the status of a public school. Between 1946 and 1976 it was part of the direct grant scheme, returning to full independence in 1976. A member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the school has a roll of approximately 650 pupils. The fees for 2017/2018 are £15,354 for day boys, and £28,827 for boarders. The William Jones Foundation's accounts for 2016 showed an income of £22.2M against an expenditure of £23.4M.\n\nIn 1613, William Jones, a prominent merchant and haberdasher, gave the Haberdashers’ Company £6,000, followed by a further £3,000 bequeathed in his will on his death in 1615, to \"ordaine a preacher, a Free-School and Almes-houses for twenty poor and old distressed people, as blind and lame, as it shall seem best to them, of the Towne of Monmouth, where it shall be bestowed\". Jones was born at Newland, Gloucestershire and brought up in Monmouth, leaving to make a sizeable fortune as a London merchant engaged in the cloth trade with the continent. The motivations for his bequest appear partly philanthropic and partly evangelical; the county of Monmouthshire in the early 17th century had a significant Catholic presence and the local historian Keith Kissack noted, \"the priority given to the preacher illustrates [Jones's] concern to convert an area in the Marches which was still, when the school opened in 1614, strongly recusant\". The order for the establishment of the school was made, retrospectively by James I in 1616 and decreed \"for ever in the town of Monmouth, one almshouse and one free grammar school\".\n\nThe Haberdashers purchased four fields as the site for the school before Jones's death, paying the sum of £100. Royal permission for this charitable purchase was required under the Statute of Mortmain, which was granted in 1614. By Jones's death in Hamburg in 1615, the almshouses, and the schoolroom and headmaster's house had been completed, although nothing now remains of the original school buildings. The bulk of Jones's considerable bequest was used for the purchase of lands at New Cross, in South-East London, and the rent rolls from that estate provided the money for the salaries and running costs associated with the school, as well as the payment of pensions to the residents of the almshouses. \n\nThe first headmaster was John Owen, M.A. of Queens' College, Cambridge, appointed on a salary of £60 per annum. Neither Owen, nor many of his 17th and 18th century successors, lasted very long unlike the school day which ran from 7–11 a.m., followed by an afternoon session from 1.30–5.00 p.m.\n\nThe mid-twentieth-century historian of the school, H. A. Ward, described its early history as \"the precarious years\". Continuing religious controversy, coupled with the English Civil War, made the town of Monmouth a divided and uncertain setting for the school. Divisions between staff, and the financial instability, and remoteness, of the Haberdashers Company, which was compelled to make substantial loans to the Parliamentary government that went unpaid for decades, and was then required to finance the rebuilding of their livery hall which was destroyed during the Great Fire of London, contributed to internal weaknesses. These difficulties continued well into the 18th century, and at one point, during the headship of the \"morose and tyrannical\" John Crowe, who was removed from his post after becoming insane, the school roll fell to just three boys. A source for information regarding the school in the mid-17th century is the diary of the school's usher, More Pye. The diary, extracts from which were published in the Monmouthshire Beacon in 1859 but which is now lost, records Pye's experiences in great detail from the date of his appointment in 1646 until his resignation in 1652.. An example is Pye's entry for February 18, 1647; \"Pd (paid) 6d ffor (for) wormeseedes and triacle for ye boys\". A less parochial entry for November 11, 1647, records Pye's monarchist sympathies, \"Ye King's Magy (Majesty) made an escape from Hampton Court, out of ye Armye's power. Vivat, vivat in aeternum\".\n\nWard described the early 19th century period of the school's history as years of \"controversy\". These focused mainly on three issues; relations between the school and the town, relations between the school, the town and the Haberdashers Company and the Court of Chancery, which together were responsible for the school's funding and oversight, and attempts to expand the school's curriculum beyond the traditional study of Latin and Greek. The first issue saw the school perceived as part of the faction of the Dukes of Beaufort, the premier landowners in the county, and directors of the town's politics from their regional base at Troy House. Early 19th century Monmouth had a strong Radical tradition led by burgesses such as Thomas Thackwell, and fuelled by the liberal positions of the local newspapers, the Monmouthshire Beacon and the Monmouthshire Merlin. The school's leadership was perceived in the town to be too close to the Beauforts, and Thackwell ran an almost fifty-year campaign against their attempts to defend the established order. The second controversy related to the governance of the school and another long campaign of attrition saw the school's Lecturer lose the responsibility for preparing an annual report on the school, this being transferred by the Court of Chancery to a Board of Visitors. The last area of conflict arose between the school's leadership, which wanted to maintain the tradition of a curriculum that involved the study solely of Latin and Greek, and the Court and the Haberdashers who wanted expansion to cover such areas as writing and arithmetic. In a damming report in 1827 they condemned \"the present Masters, though so liberally paid, and having so little to do, consider themselves engaged only to teach Latin and Greek. A school teaching those branches of learning only will never be useful to a place of such confined population as Monmouth\". Reforms introduced by John Oakley Hill in 1852, saw the establishment of Upper and Lower Schools, the former continuing to provide a classical education, while the latter had a curriculum focused on writing and arithmetic. William Coxe, who undertook extensive tours of Wales in the very late 18th and early 19th centuries in the company of his friend, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, recorded his impressions of the school in the second volume of his \"An Historical tour in Monmouthshire\", published in 1801. Describing the school as enjoying \"a high reputation under the care of (the headmaster) the Rev. John Powell\", Coxe retells the mythical story of the school's establishment and records a \"portrait of the founder, habited in the costume of the age of James the First, with an inscription 'Walter William Jones, haberdasher and merchant of London etc.' is preserved in the school room\".\n\nIn the early 1850s the Court of Chancery insisted on the appointment of an external examiner. His report of 1852 was not encouraging; \"many of the boys appear so ignorant as to be a disgrace to their parents, still more than to their teachers\". If the academic outlook remained bleak, the financial position of the school was transformed in this period. The sale of part of the New Cross estate to railway developers, and the vastly increased rents accruing from the development and expansion of London saw the Haberdashers' fortunes dramatically increase. The availability of funds led to the complete rebuilding of the school on its original site between 1864, the school's 250th anniversary, and the end of the century. The school's expansion was undertaken during the long reign of the Rev. Charles Manley Roberts, headmaster for 32 years from 1859 to 1892. During Roberts's time Monmouth became an early member of the prestigious Headmaster's Conference (created by Edward Thring of Uppingham in 1869), a mark of its increasing reputation and status as a public school. The school's reputation for sporting prowess also rose, its rugby teams and rowers enjoying particular success. As a result of rising revenues from rents and investments, by the mid-19th century, Monmouth's endowment was one of largest of any school in England and Wales. To use the resulting surpluses, the original foundation was reorganised in 1891 to support a new girls’ school and an elementary school in the town, as well as a boys' grammar school (West Monmouth School) in Pontypool. As importantly for the school's development, the rule that limited applications to boys from Monmouthshire and the neighbouring counties was set aside, and applications were opened to the entirety of Wales and England.\n\nMonmouth School's Combined Cadet Force was reportedly the last CCF in the country to change its uniforms to khaki from the traditional blue at the outbreak of war in August 1914. The conflict brought the award of the school's only Victoria Cross, to Angus Buchanan in 1916 for conspicuous bravery in the Mesopotamian campaign. Blinded by a bullet to the head the following year, he returned to Monmouthshire and worked as a solicitor in Coleford, unveiling the school's war memorial in 1921. In total, seventy-six old boys from the school were killed in the war. The school's Bricknell Library, founded in 1921, commemorated one of them, Ernest Thomas Samuel Bricknell, who died in October 1916 from wounds received at the Battle of the Somme. \n\nFurther loss of life occurred in 1921, when the Head of School, G. H. Sutherland, drowned in the Wye during a rowing match between the school and Hereford Cathedral School. Sutherland is commemorated by the sundial in the school's cloister. The Second World War added the names of a further sixty-one Old Monmothians to the lists of the dead inscribed on the school's war memorial. During the war, the school hosted the entire school and staff from King Edward VI Five Ways School, Birmingham, who were evacuated due to German bombing of the Midlands.\n\nInternal conflict within the school's management continued in the mid-twentieth century, with the governors sacking two headmasters within three years. This led to the school's expulsion from the Headmasters Conference, and to that body's advising any of its members against applying for the vacant headship. The impasse was resolved in 1959, with the appointment of Robert Glover. Reorganisation of the Haberdashers' endowments also occurred at this time. The elementary school, founded with Haberdashers' funds in 1891, was transferred to County Council control in 1940 with West Monmouth School at Pontypool following in 1955. This left the William Jones's Schools Foundation responsible for Monmouth School and Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls – also known as HMSG – both of which joined the Direct Grant scheme in 1946.\n\nAnother significant development for the school's location was the building of the A40, which \"severed (Monmouth) ruthlessly from the river on which in the past it had depended\" and cut off the school from its historic frontage onto the River Wye. This led to the permanent closure of the school's ceremonial entrance, the Wye Bridge Gate, constructed by Henry Stock in the 1890s. The direct impact on the school was perhaps less significant, Ward had recorded an early comment on the entrance, \"that ancient gate which never opened is but thrice a year on notable occasions, such as when the coal cart comes\".\n\nIn 1976, with the ending of the Direct Grant system, the school returned to full independence. Having argued strongly against the ending of the grant system, the headmaster at the time, Robert Glover, gave a warning as to the likely consequences, \"if direct grant goes, the school which has served the boys of Monmouth for four hundred years, will suddenly become for many families financially prohibitive\". In response, a committee of the Old Monmothian Club, headed by Lord Brecon and Sir Derek Ezra undertook a campaign to raise funding for scholarships which accumulated £100,000 in ten weeks. During his tenure Glover also secured re-admittance to the Headmasters' Conference. To mark the school's four hundredth anniversary a service of thanksgiving was held at St. Paul's Cathedral, on 19 March 2014, attended by some 2,200 pupils and staff from the school and from Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, as well as Haberdashers and friends of the Schools.\n\nIn 2018, the Haberdashers rebranded their group of schools in the town as \"Haberdashers Monmouth Schools\" and renamed the senior schools as Monmouth School for Boys and Monmouth School for Girls respectively.\n\nThe Monmouthshire antiquarian Charles Heath described the traditional, and almost certainly inaccurate, story of the school's foundation in his \"Accounts of the Ancient and Present State of the Town of Monmouth\", published in 1804. Heath records that William Jones, now established as a successful and wealthy merchant, returned to his home town of Newland disguised as a beggar. Receiving a hostile reception, he travelled to Monmouth, where he was more warmly received and where, as a consequence, he funded the construction of the school and associated almshouses. The story is taken from an earlier oral tradition, also recorded in Archdeacon Coxe's \"An Historical Tour in Monmouthshire\", published three years before. In 1899, the Rev. W. M. Warlow published his \"History of the Charities of William Jones at Monmouth and Newland\". His fellow cleric and master, the Rev. K. M. Pitt wrote a more focused account, \"Monmouth School in the 1860s\". H. A. Ward published \"Monmouth School: 1614–1964: An Outline History\" to commemorate the school's 350th anniversary. In 1995, Keith Kissack published his history, \"Monmouth School and Monmouth: 1614–1995\" and in 2014, in celebration of the school's quatercentenary, two masters at the school, Stephen Edwards, who wrote the text, and Keith Moseley, who took the photographs, published a new history, \"Monmouth School: The First 400 Years\".\n\nWilliam Jones's original foundation provided for a schoolroom, on the site of the present chapel, houses for the Headmaster and Lecturer, and almshouses segregated by sex.. A painting by J.A. Evans, of later date and purchased on behalf of the school by the then Headmaster Lionel James in 1921, shows the buildings and is titled \"The Old School Room. Built A.D. 1614. Pulled down to make room for the present school room, 1865\". Nothing of these buildings remains. The local writer and artist Fred Hando records that the bell, which hung above the schoolroom, was cast at the Evan Evans foundry at Chepstow in 1716.\n\nIn 1864 the Haberdashers undertook a substantial rebuilding of the school. Funded by the rising fortunes of Jones's bequest on the back of the Victorian expansion of London, the work was mostly undertaken by William Snooke and Henry Stock, of the firm Snooke & Stock, surveyors to the Haberdashers' Company. Snooke built the chapel, two schoolrooms and a classroom in 1864–1865, followed in the 1870s by the library, Headmaster's House and the buildings which now form Monmouth House and Hereford House. These buildings are all Grade II listed. The Monmouth Alms Houses, on Almshouse Street, were rebuilt by J. B. Bunning in 1842, and redeveloped by William Burn in 1895–1896. They now form part of the school and incorporate a large inscription panel describing the benefactions of the Jones Foundation. The almshouses are also Grade II listed. The chapel was further extended in 1875. Snooke's work was not universally praised; a report from the School's Commissioner commenting, \"the architect has arranged the buildings in a most inconvenient manner, and the ventilation is deficient.\" School House, with its ceremonial arched entrance and coat of arms facing the Wye Bridge, and the adjacent technology block, were designed by Henry Stock in 1894–1895. They are Grade II listed buildings as of 8 October 2005. The style of the School House block mirrors that of the main block of Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls, which Stock designed at the same time. The war memorial was dedicated in 1921, Angus Buchanan (VC) attending the ceremony. The memorial is a Grade II listed structure. To the west of Stock's School House block, and set into the wall previously facing the Wye, and now completely overshadowed by the A40 by-pass, is a pair of iron gates, of 18th century date and installed at the school in 1941, that come from the Haberdashers' Hall in London which was destroyed during the Blitz.\n\nThe school's building of greatest architectural merit is the Grade II* listed Chapel House. The architectural historian John Newman describes the 18th century building, situated on the Hereford Road away from the main school site, as \"the best house in the entire street\". More modern developments include the Hall of 1961, redeveloped in the early 21st century and now the Blake Theatre, the Red Lion Block of the same date and the Science Block of 1981–1984. In 1985–1986, two ceramic murals were designed for the chapel by the Polish religious artist Adam Kossowski, a friend and wartime colleague of the school's Head of Art from 1947–1978, Otto Maciag. Executed by Maciag, and another art master at the school, Michael Tovey, the murals were dedicated at a service conducted by the Bishop of Monmouth, the Rt Rev Clifford Wright on 3 October 1987. He described them as \"masterpieces of twentieth-century religious art”. In November 2008, a £2.3 million sports pavilion was completed and opened by the former British Lions player and Welsh captain, Eddie Butler, an old boy of the School. It was designed by the architects Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams. In 2011 the school began the \"Heart Project\". This led to the sale of some outlying sites, such as St. James's House, and the re-organisation of others, to assist in the raising of funds for the redevelopment of the main school site. Further funds came from the Haberdashers' Company, and the first phase was completed with the rebuilding of the Red Lion Block, now renamed the William Jones Building.\n\nWith 650 pupils, the school offers boarding and day places as well as preparatory departments in a single-sex environment. A range of GCSE, A and AS level subjects are offered, with the Sixth Form having some collaborative teaching with pupils from the sister school, Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls (HMSG). Tatler magazine's 2017 Schools Guide noted its strong academic performance. The school charges fees for attendance. From September 2017, the annual fees are: day pupils, £15,354, boarding pupils, £28,827. The school operates a substantial bursary programme. In September 2018, Monmouth School was renamed Monmouth School for Boys after a merger of all five Haberdashers' Company schools in Monmouth. The Foundation now operates under the name Haberdashers' Monmouth Schools and consists of: Monmouth School for Boys (formerly Monmouth School), Monmouth School for Girls (formerly Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls or HMSG), Monmouth School Boys' Prep (formerly The Grange), Monmouth School Girls' Prep (formerly Inglefield House) and Monmouth Schools Pre-Prep and Nursery (formerly Agincourt School). \n\nThere are three age divisions in the school; lower (forms I and II) middle (forms III, IV, and V) and sixth form (forms VI.1 and VI.2). Within these divisions, the school operates a House system. As at 2018, the houses are:\n\nThe school has its own theatre, the Blake, opened in 2004. Funded by Bob Blake, a former pupil, it is used as a venue for performances by both the school and the girls' schools, and by external performers. The Glover Music School has an auditorium and teaching and practice rooms. The strong musical tradition owes much to Michael Eveleigh, director of music at the school from 1950–1986, and his successors, there having been only five directors of music since the Second World War. Other extra-curricular activities include foreign expeditions, music and drama events as well as a newspaper, \"The Lion\", a creative writing leaflet, \"The Lion's Tale\", and an annual magazine, \"The Monmothian\", first published in 1882. The Combined Cadet Force, founded in 1904, which has both Army and RAF sections, is operated in collaboration with HMSG.\n\nThe school has a notable sporting tradition, with a high number of successful sportsmen amongst its alumni. The main sports are rugby, rowing and cricket, with rowing in particular achieving notable success in recent years. Facilities include a boathouse, a sports complex which houses a six-lane swimming pool, indoor facilities including a weights and fitness suite, tennis courts, and a full size astroturf pitch. The Hitchcock sports pavilion, completed in 2008, stands on the playing fields, on the other side of the Wye from the school's main site. In addition to rugby, rowing and cricket, the school offers a range of other sports which include soccer, cross-country, tennis, basketball, golf, athletics, swimming, water polo, canoeing, and squash.\n\nThe school has an alumni society, the Old Monmothian Club, founded in 1886.\n\nIn June 2009, the school paid out £150,000 to settle a landmark pensions rights case brought by female catering and support staff who claimed that, as part-time workers, they had been unjustly excluded from the school's pension scheme.\n\n style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n\n\n\n style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963654", "title": "Mark Fowler", "text": "Mark Fowler\n\nMark Fowler is a fictional character in the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\". Mark, an original regular character when the series started in February 1985, became a semi-regular after his original portrayer David Scarboro was written out of the role in April 1985. Scarboro made brief returns to the role in 1986 and 1987. Scarboro committed suicide in April 1988 and his body was found at the bottom of Beachy Head, East Sussex. Mark was recast in 1990, with former Grange Hill regular Todd Carty taking on the role. From this point the character was a permanent fixture in the series and Carty remained in the role until the character was written out of the series in early 2003.\n\nInitially a delinquent teenager, he became a changed man when he returned to Albert Square as a 22-year-old in 1990. Following his return, Mark was featured in some of the most prominent storylines during his tenure on the soap. He announced that he had been diagnosed with HIV, which forced him to grow up fast and accept his responsibilities. He frequently found it difficult to accept the restrictions of the illness, which finally caused his death in April 2004. Other storylines included marriages to Gill Fowler (Susanna Dawson), who had also contracted HIV and died the day after their wedding, Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson), arguably the most problematic of them all which ended in 1999, and his marriage to Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin).\n\nMark is first of three children born to Albert Square residents Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) and his wife Pauline (Wendy Richard). Initially, a teenage Mark gets involved in drugs with local thug Nick Cotton (John Altman), attempts to join a racist organisation known as The New Movement, is a suspect in Reg Cox's (Johnnie Clayton) murder, and generally clashes with his parents. With no solution to these problems in sight, he abruptly leaves home without telling anyone. He is not seen again until eight months later when he contacts his parents through a runaways' agency and Pauline and Arthur find him in Southend-on-Sea. Mark is living with an older Swedish woman named Ingrid (Sally Faulkner) and her two children, John (Anthony Short) and Melanie (Vanessa Short), who call Mark \"Daddy\". He and Ingrid split up soon afterwards and Mark moves around the country.\n\nMark returns to Walford several times for brief visits. In July, he brings his Welsh friend Owen Hughes (Philip Brock). The duo cause problems after Cassie Carpenter (Delanie Forbes) steals their cannabis and her parents, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) and Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe), catch her smoking it; the Carpenters refuse to speak to the Fowlers for some time afterwards. In November, Pauline receives news that Mark is in Borstal detention centre for drug offences, burglary, and assaulting a policeman. Visiting him, Pauline finds him unrepentant but due for release in a few weeks. After his release he briefly returns to Walford, but refuses to stay despite Pauline's pleas. He is not seen again until Christmas the same year, when he visits unexpectedly to spend the day with his family. Mark astutely guesses that Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) is his niece's father but keeps this to himself. This is the last time Mark is seen for over two years.\n\nMark returns to Albert Square in September 1990 as a changed man. He is more caring and stable, having grown out of his rebellious stage. His new maturity is due to the fact that he has contracted HIV, which has forced him to become more responsible. Mark develops a close friendship with Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) and initially doesn't tell anyone about his HIV status. But as he and Diane grow closer, he finally tells her the truth. He believes that he contracted the virus from Gill Robinson (Susanna Dawson), his girlfriend in Newcastle, who visits briefly later that year but leaves when she sees him kissing Diane. Mark initially tells Gill that he isn't infected but later tells the truth. Mark's relationship with Diane never becomes serious but she is a good friend and confidante and persuades Mark to have counselling at the Terrence Higgins Trust. Mark initially turns on his male counsellor, relaying his bitterness at being a potential AIDS victim, but later feels the benefits of the counselling. Mark loves Diane for keeping his secret and he asks her to marry him but she gently refuses and leaves Walford to live in France.\n\nLater that year, following the example of a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV-positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By now, he is dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing Day Mark tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. They sit in stunned silence while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes away for a while. On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's ignorance is apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home sends Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies.\n\nMark later befriends local teenage tearaway Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) but their friendship is severely tested when she becomes obsessed with him. Mark, still grieving for Gill, is horrified when he discovers that Mandy has been reading his late wife's diary and has dressed up in her clothes. Despite this, he invites Mandy to live with him after Den's friend Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) throws her out. On Christmas Day, Mandy goes to visit her mother but is attacked by her stepfather; Mark arrives just in time to rescue her and invites her for Christmas dinner at the Fowler household.\n\nMark takes over running the family fruit and vegetable stall in the market after his uncle, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), leaves. He also begins casually dating his sister's housemate Shelley Lewis (Nicole Arumugam), but is reluctant to tell her about his HIV status. Whilst on a trip to Amsterdam, Shelley makes it clear to Mark that she wants to sleep with him, forcing him to admit his HIV status. Shelley is furious that he did not think to tell her this before and tells him she never wants to see him again. Mark takes the rejection badly and stops taking his HIV medication. During Christmas that year, he is rushed to hospital after collapsing. Mandy visits him in hospital and learns that he has HIV. When Shelley finds out that Mark is ill, she returns and admits that she really cares for him and they reconcile. However, Shelley tries to rush things by asking Mark to meet her family and go on holiday with her parents. She becomes infatuated and tries to spend as much time with him as she can. Mark fears that the relationship is moving too quickly and Mark decides to end it. When he tries to tell Shelley this, she uses emotional blackmail to stop him, saying that she has risked her health being with him so he owes her. When this doesn't work, she threatens to tell everyone about his HIV status, but leaves Walford when her bluff doesn't work.\n\nFollowing Joe's death of an AIDS-related illness, Mark meets a Scottish woman named Ruth Aitken (Caroline Paterson), who is also visiting a friend. After a brief conversation, the two decide to go for a drink together. They start dating and Ruth copes with his HIV status but her father, a strict Presbyterian minister, refuses to give his blessing to her relationship with Mark and disowns her when she announces her plans to marry Mark. They marry in Scotland but problems surface in their marriage. She persuades Mark - and herself - that she is happy about not having children (due to the inevitable spread of the AIDS virus to herself and the baby), but it is soon clear that she is fooling herself.\n\nMark is injured in a pub brawl during which he saved the square's local hardman, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), from getting glassed by a punter. However, after calling the ambulance, Grant overhears Ruth telling the paramedics about Mark's HIV status. Around this time, Mark wins money at an illegal poker match that takes place at the Bridge Street Cafe run by Steve Elliot (Mark Monero) and gives the money to Arthur. However, Arthur is arrested and asked where he got the money. Mark tells the police but he needs a witness. He asks Steve to help, but Steve is not willing to help due to fear of repercussions with the two gangsters who organised the game. Arthur spends a stretch in prison, leaving Mark devastated. Steve eventually decides to help but leaves Albert Square when he is threatened by the criminal firm. Arthur is eventually released.\n\nTo add to his problems, Mark is further devastated when Arthur dies of a brain haemorrhage in May 1996, after being injured in a prison riot several weeks earlier and the Fowlers are in mourning. During this time, Mark's HIV issues escalates when Kathy's infant child Ben (Matthew Silver) becomes seriously ill, and Grant informs his brother Phil (Steve McFadden) - the child's father - about the situation. Grant blackmails Ruth, telling her that she has until Arthur's funeral to give up babysitting Ben or he will tell the whole square about Mark. Phil and Kathy soon learn about Mark's condition, which causes Ruth to lose her job as a child minder. Mark confronts Grant after learning he blackmailed Ruth about his HIV status but Grant reassures Mark that he won't tell anyone else. On the day of his father's funeral, Mark becomes angry that Willy Roper (Michael Tudor-Barnes) had framed Arthur for embezzlement and assaults Willy at the cemetery. He believes that he was the one who caused Arthur's death.\n\nMark's HIV status becomes public knowledge after an argument in the Queen Victoria between Pauline and Ted Hills (Brian Croucher) is overheard by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). She hears Ted tell Pauline that he knows that Mark has AIDS. Peggy spreads the gossip around the Square and the residents begin to boycott Mark's fruit and vegetable stall, fearing they will catch the virus, showing their ignorance on their knowledge of HIV or AIDS. Pauline springs to her son's defence and she and Peggy have a vicious fight, but even Pauline cannot defuse the prejudice, and Mark comes home to find the words \"AIDS scum\" graffitied on his wall. This is too much and he decides to present his neighbours with a few facts about his illness in The Queen Victoria; firstly by telling them that he does not have AIDS but is HIV positive, which is a non-contagious virus, forcing them to acknowledge their bigotry. Grant speaks to Mark the next day and tells him that no one is barred from The Queen Victoria unless he says so. Peggy remains uncertain, but is forced to realise that Mark might appreciate some support when she is diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nMark and Ruth foster a six-year-old girl named Jessie Moore (Chelsey Paden), but returning her to her mother proves too heartbreaking and their marriage goes into crisis. When Mark's cousin Conor Flaherty (Seán Gleeson) shows an interest in Ruth, Mark becomes jealous and the relationship falls apart. After they split, Ruth succumbs to Conor's charms and becomes pregnant by him. She leaves Walford with Conor.\n\nIn 2000, Mark's past troubles resurface when Nick returns to the square and the two embark on a longstanding feud. This soon gets Mark's younger brother, Martin (James Alexandrou), involved when Nick attempts to ensnare him with drugs - as he once did with Mark. Towards the end of the year, Nick gets one over Mark after giving Martin ecstasy. When Mark discovers this, he decides to settle the score with his tormentor once and for all. Mark spikes Nick's drink, leads him up to the Walford viaduct, and watches delightedly as the intoxicated Nick falls - just as midnight strikes and 2001 commences. Nick survives the fall, but is left severely crippled and vows revenge against Mark. He enlists his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald), who had recently befriended Martin, to take revenge on Mark. However, when Ashley is hesitant to kill Mark himself, Nick takes matters into his own hands and drains the brake fluid on his motorbike. The next day, Ashley - not knowing that his father had done - steals Mark's motorbike and attempts to run him over in a last-ditch attempt to impress his father, but is killed after he ends up crashing into the launderette. On the eve of Ashley's funeral, Mark and Nick have their final showdown when Nick attempts to kill Mark with a knife. Mark overpowers Nick, who then blurts out that he should've been the one on the motorbike instead of Ashley - thus exposing his involvement in his son's death. Mark berates Nick for causing his own son's death, then leaves him to be disowned by his mother Dot (June Brown) - who had just overheard Nick confess to his role in Ashley's death. At the end of Ashley's funeral, Mark watches as Nick leaves the square shortly afterwards and mutters to himself \"Some people you're just glad to see the back of\"; their rivalry is brought to an end as Nick leaves the square and never sees Mark again.\n\nBy 2001, Nick wasn't the only enemy Mark had been clashing with throughout the year. He embarked on a conflict with Phil after learning that he had been mistreating his girlfriend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin), whom Mark has been growing fond of from that point. Mark soon takes Lisa to live with him after she leaves Phil, and they start dating - much to Pauline's horror. Mark also defends Kathy's son Ian (Adam Woodyatt) from Phil on several occasions, particularly when Mark witnesses Phil attacking Ian and is forced to separate them. When Phil is shot on the night his nemesis Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Lisa's best friend Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite) get married, Mark becomes a prime suspect as the police gather information on his hatred for Phil - which leads his godson Jamie (Jack Ryder) and cousin Billy (Perry Fenwick) to each separately accuse Mark of shooting Phil. One month later, Mark learns that Phil has recovered and checked himself out of the hospital to exact revenge - prompting him to find Lisa in order to protect her from Phil. When he finds them at her house, Mark learns from Phil that it was Lisa who shot him. Lisa confesses to shooting Phil. Despite this, Mark continues to defend Lisa and tells Phil that she isn't totally responsible for the crime - stating that the abuse Phil had inflicted upon Lisa is what set the course of his shooting in the first place. Phil grudgingly comes to accept these terms, and decides to cover Lisa's involvement by framing his ex-business partner Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for the crime. Mark and Lisa observe Phil planning to incriminate Dan in the shooting, even going as far as to get Steve and Mel involved with his plan. However, Dan is found not guilty and he takes revenge on Phil and Steve by kidnapping Mel and fleeing the country with a money ransom - all the while believing that Steve had shot Phil, meaning that Dan was never aware that Lisa had shot Phil in the first place.\n\nAt the point Phil's actions have resulted in Dan fleeing the country and Steve's marriage with Mel were left on the verge of facing jeopardy, Mark and Lisa conduct a plan to pretend that she is expecting Mark's baby - as he had grown to love Lisa so much ever since her troubles with Phil had started. To facilitate their lie, Mark insists that he'd taken all necessary precautions in relation to his HIV and they fool everyone for a while. He later proposes to Lisa shortly after her baby Louise is born. However, Mark is devastated to learn that Phil is actually the child's biological father. This Phil discovers when Grant's former wife Sharon (Letitia Dean) informs him about Louise's true parentage, and Phil vows to take an active role in his daughter's upbringing. Mark and Lisa marry, but their happiness is short-lived: Lisa is still very much in love with Phil and Phil knows it so he seduces her in order to get more access to Louise. After Sharon discovers Phil's intentions, she talks him out of his plan and he ends the affair with Lisa, but Mark finds out and after just five months of marriage Lisa leaves Mark and resumes her affair with Phil. This causes Mark to break down by the time he eventually discovers this. After confronting Phil about the discovery, Mark almost rapes Lisa. Horrified by his actions, Mark leaves Walford for a short while. However, Lisa soon realizes her mistake living with Phil and wants to reconcile with Mark, but Pauline refuses to tell her where Mark has gone. Mark eventually returns at Christmas.\n\nIn January 2003, Mark's doctor tells him that his body is rejecting the medication that will prolong his life and slow down the onset of AIDS. Accepting that he will not live for much longer, he decides to leave rather than let his family see him endure a slow, painful death. On 14 February 2003, he makes a tearful farewell to his family and friends and rides off on his motorbike, although he remains in contact with family. In April 2004, Martin receives a telephone call from Mark's nurse, informing him that Mark has died from an AIDS-related form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His body is returned to Walford and he is given a heart-felt send-off by the residents. Following his death, Mark would be referenced by his own family and friends during the subsequent years that go on in the square; particularly in 2015 when Nick returns and, after recalling Dot about the time he tried to kill Mark, ultimately dies from a drug overdose.\n\nMark Fowler was one of the original 23 characters invented by the creators of \"EastEnders\", Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mark was a member of the first family of \"EastEnders\", the Beales and Fowlers, and Holland took the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background. Mark's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\".\n\nSeveral young actors were seen and read for the part of Mark (including Gary Hailes, who would later play the gay barrow boy, Barry Clark). On paper, David Scarboro was the least likely to get the job as he was relatively inexperienced, having previously only appeared in a little-known made-for-television film and \"Grange Hill\". His reading was not a huge success as he mumbled most of his lines. However, Holland and Smith were taken with his appearance, particularly his \"piercing eyes\", which reminded them of James Dean. They felt that he would be \"dynamite on-screen\", and his likeness to their vision of the character was uncanny, so they offered him the role.\n\nMark was originally scripted to be a wayward delinquent and was due to feature heavily within the first year of the series. However, as soon as the regular gruelling schedule of \"EastEnders\" production established itself, it became clear that Scarboro was not happy in the role. The stress of the heavy workload and the sudden fame that came to all the actors became difficult for him to cope with. He became unhappy with the schedule and his scripts and refused to play Mark as a racist as was intended. Holland and Smith decided to write the character out of the show to allow the actor to come to terms with the situation better. On-screen, Mark was being implicated in the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton) and was being tempted into heroin by Nick Cotton (John Altman).\n\nFearing Nick Cotton and the police, Mark ran away from home in April 1985. As this had not been the original plan for the character, it meant a hectic period of re-writing early in 1985. The first 50+ scripts were reworked to accommodate this major change. Many of the stories intended for Mark were subsequently given to Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Mark's sister Michelle (Susan Tully) - which partially explains why her character became so prominent in the first year. It still left a gap though, because several of Mark's functions in the serial, as slightly the eldest of the youngsters, could not have been taken over by the others. A new character needed to be introduced to restore the balance to its original shape, which is why the character of Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) was introduced later in 1985. This meant introducing the audience to a character and a story approximately a year before it had been originally intended - \"Wicksy\" had originally been scheduled to join the series around the same time as his mother Pat, who arrived in June 1986. Scarboro returned to the show briefly in December 1985 in a storyline that saw Mark's parents, Pauline (Wendy Richard) and Arthur (Bill Treacher) search for him in Southend. The storyline's intention was to help highlight the problems some parents face when their teenage children disappear from home. He returned again for brief stints in 1986 and 1987. His final appearance as Mark was on Christmas Day 1987.\n\nScarboro was never to make a return due to his suicide in April 1988. However, BBC bosses decided not to kill off the character, and later set out to find a new actor to reprise the role. Subsequently, the role was recast in 1990 to actor Todd Carty, renowned for his role as Tucker Jenkins in \"Grange Hill\". At this time, Mark returned to the series as a permanent character. Carty later reported that he enjoyed playing Mark because it gave him \"good dramatic stuff to get his teeth into.\" The most notable storyline involving Mark after his return to Albert Square was the revelation that he had contracted HIV. Mark discovered he was HIV positive in 1991, and informed his family of this on Boxing Day that year. There then followed a traumatic journey as he struggled first to come to terms with the news, then track down his previous partners to inform them that he was infected with the virus. The problems didn't end there, however, as Mark then had to battle with the fear and ignorance of those living around him - including his parents. Many of Albert Square's residents initially rejected him when they found out that he was HIV positive. Mark married one of his ex-partners Gill (Susanna Dawson), who had also been infected with the virus but in her case it had progressed to AIDS, and she subsequently died the day after the wedding in 1992.\n\nThe episode in which Gill died (written by Debbie Cook and directed by Leonard Lewis) has been chosen by writer Colin Brake as one of the most memorable episodes of 1992. In his book, \"EastEnders: The First Ten Years\" Blake comments, \"Although in many ways the episode was sad and downbeat it was not without its positive aspects, as Mark talked to his sister about his own mortality.\" Susanna Dawson, the actress who played Gill, found the experience of playing a person living with, and dying from, AIDS so intense that she co-produced an educational video based on the subject for use in schools and wrote a book, \"The Gill and Mark Story\", to accompany it.\n\nMark became the first mainstream soap character to be diagnosed as HIV-positive. The storyline came after a government request to \"spread the word\". Mark lived with the condition for 13 years before dying of an AIDS-related illness. The Terrence Higgins Trust worked with the production team for the duration of Mark's story. Despite all the public health campaigns concerning HIV transmission, the biggest peak in requests for testing in Britain was seen in January 1991 when Mark Fowler was diagnosed HIV-positive. Carty has commented: \"I feel that the storyline educated people at a time when there were lots of misconceptions about HIV and AIDS…My main concern was that they'd get it right and, overall, I think they did - because it showed someone living with HIV, as opposed to dying of it.\"\n\nThe storyline was widely applauded for the way it handled the plot and the following issues that the scriptwriters explored, from anti-retroviral drugs, safe sex and prejudice. The storyline was so successful in raising awareness that a 1999 survey by the National AIDS Trust found teenagers garnered most of their information about HIV from the soap.\n\nThe character of Mark remained in the show for a further 13 years after his re-introduction, and featured in an array of storylines including two failed marriages, which were scripted to highlight the difficulties that can occur in a relationship when one partner has HIV and the other does not. Ultimately Mark overcame the stigma and he enjoyed several years of happy, healthy living before finally succumbing to an AIDS-related illness and dying in April 2004 off-screen. \"EastEnders\" executive producer Louise Berridge said Carty had made a \"fantastic contribution\" to the soap and Mark has been a \"pivotal figure\" on Albert Square, but the character had finally run its course.\n\nCampaigners have since suggested that Mark's HIV storyline could have been handled better in the latter years. Lisa Power, head of policy at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said \"in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community\". She also said \"he was perhaps killed off too early as advancements in drugs are helping people live for much longer... Saying that, one decent soap episode is worth a thousand leaflets in schools. That is why we would always go out of our way to help scriptwriters. TV and films can be very powerful.\"\n\nOn 1 July 2002, it was announced that Mark Fowler had been axed from \"EastEnders\" and that the character was set to depart in early 2003. Carty said, \"I've had 12 brilliant years on \"EastEnders\", and they've been fantastic to me [...] I'll deeply miss all the cast and crew and everyone involved on the show.\" \"EastEnders\" executive producer Louise Berridge said that Carty had made a \"fantastic contribution\" to the soap and Mark had been a \"pivotal figure\" on Albert Square, but the character had finally run its course. She went on to say \"Todd and I have discussed this at some length and agreed that it was time for Mark to hang up his leather jacket for the last time [...] We will all miss Todd, who is one of our best-loved actors, and wish him every success in the future.\" BBC One's head of drama John Yorke said, \"We want to thank Todd for his great contribution to \"EastEnders\" over the last 12 years.\" Some reports disclosed that Carty was \"upset and angry\" by the decision to axe Mark. According to Carty, the decision was \"a bolt from the blue\" from the producers.\n\nOn 16 December 2002, it was reported that Mark was to be killed-off. It was also announced that the character's death would be shown off-screen. A spokesperson for the show said, \"There is now nothing more he can do medically to stop the advancement of the infection [...] Rather than see his family suffer from the deterioration of his health and eventual death, Mark decides to leave Walford to spend his remaining days seeing the world and coming to terms with his fate.\" Carty said: \"Portraying someone with HIV has been very challenging at times but to learn Mark has been inspirational to real-life people with HIV is really humbling.\" Reflecting on his time in the soap, Carty went on to say \"I've had great fun, made some lovely friends and have been very lucky working with terrific scripts and storylines.\" Mark's off-screen death aired in April 2004.\n\nCarty had said that the late EastEnders star Wendy Richard was like a mother to him. \"When I was filming my goodbye scenes, those tears were real. Seeing Wendy break down was one of the most poignant moments. The whole day was so emotional - I had to hold it together and stay strong for Wendy\". Carty had also told the \"Daily Mirror\" that the pair had struck up a 20-year friendship after they were cast.\n\nFollowing Mark's departure in February 2003, the BBC was accused of \"killing\" HIV victims' hopes. Edinburgh-based HIV charity Waverley Care reacted negatively to scriptwriters for \"scaring\" victims away from seeking treatment by \"painting a bleak picture\". Real-life HIV survivors also hit out at the BBC for destroying their hope by failing to give an accurate view of the range of treatment now available. However, soap bosses hit back and defended the storyline as an \"accurate portrayal\" of many real victims' experiences. They also pointed out that they had the backing of AIDS charity The Terence Higgins Trust. David Johnson, director of Waverley Care, said \"Scriptwriters for \"EastEnders\" - and other soaps - carry a huge burden of responsibility. The current story is a difficult one because, although drug treatments are not straightforward for everyone, many people do very well on them. Encouraging people to come forward for testing is a key issue - the earlier an HIV diagnosis is made, the greater the likelihood of staying well on treatments. Our concern with the Mark Fowler storyline is that it will increase the fear associated with HIV, potentially discouraging people from being tested at all or from starting on drug treatments if they feel there is little hope for the future.\"\n\nA real-life HIV victim had been on a variety of combination therapy treatments since he was diagnosed HIV-positive. Mark’s departure from \"EastEnders\" left the victim \"outraged\". He said, \"I’m a big soap fan and, until now, feel that the HIV issue had been handled sensitively in \"EastEnders\" [...] I was very hurt and upset by the Mark Fowler story. He’d been told that there wasn’t another combination of drugs available - even though he’d only had three. There are new developments in drug therapy all the time and I’m worried that this storyline will make people give up hope. Or that they won’t start treatments in the first place.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1963655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963655", "title": "Football in Scotland", "text": "Football in Scotland\n\nAssociation football (, ) is one of the national sports of Scotland and the most popular sport in the country. There is a long tradition of \"football\" games in Orkney, Lewis and southern Scotland, especially the Scottish Borders, although many of these include carrying the ball and passing \"by hand\", and despite bearing the name \"football\" bear little resemblance to association football.\n\nFounded in 1873, Scotland has the second oldest national Football Association in the world (behind England's FA), and has various professional and amateur levels. The trophy for the national cup, the Scottish Cup, is the oldest national sporting trophy in the world. Scotland and Scottish football clubs hold many records for football attendances.\n\nA game known as \"football\" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century. It was prohibited by the Football Act 1424, as it distracted men from their marital duties, and although the law fell into disuse, it was not repealed until 1906. The sport was played by commoners and royalty, such as King James VI and Mary, Queen of Scots, alike. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. In the 1700s, Football was known to cause riots and severe damage to both property and players. Football in general had almost an ill repute. Football was mainly played during times of festival like New Years Day or Fastern's E'en. During these events, football was a \"mass participant, low regulation event\". There were also separate matches for men and women. Association Football's use as a leisure sport started in the 1840s as working schedules started to shift with the introduction of the half day work schedule on Saturdays. This search for \"rational recreation\" was brought upon by the temperance movement along with city municipal and philanthropic projects. By the late 1800s, Association Football was one of the major cultural activities among the male population of Western Scotland, both as player and as spectator. Railroads helped with accessibility for travel to games in other cities, making a professional league viable. Of the thirty seven football grounds in existence in 1987, twenty of them were within one hundred yards of a railroad station.\n\nIt is clear that the game was rough and tackles allowed included the \"charging\" and pushing/holding of opposing players (\"drive that man back\" in the original translation, \"repelle eum\" in original Latin). It has been suggested that this game bears similarities to rugby football. Contrary to media reports in 2006 there is no reference to forward passing, game rules, marking players or team formation. These reports described it as \"an amazing new discovery\" but has actually been well documented in football history literature since the early twentieth century and available on the internet since at least 2000. English public schools, such as Eton and Harrow, \"civilised\" the game by drawing up rules that encouraged players to kick the ball and forbid them from carrying it.\n\nThe Scottish Football Association (SFA) is the principal organising body for Scottish football. Members of the SFA include clubs in Scotland, affiliated national associations as well as local associations. It was formed in March 1873, making it the World's second oldest national football association. The founding clubs were Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern Granville and Kilmarnock.\n\nThe SFA is responsible for the operation of the Scotland National Football Team, the annual Scottish Cup and several other duties important to the functioning of the game in Scotland.\n\nProfessional league football in Scotland is run by the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) comprising 4 tiers. Feeding into the bottom tier of the SPFL is the Scottish Highland Football League, and the Scottish Lowland Football League. Other leagues - East of Scotland League, South of Scotland League and the North Caledonian League are deemed to be \"senior\" and are administered by the Scottish Football Association. Administered separately are clubs in the Scottish Junior Football Association and Scottish Amateur Football Association. In 2014-15 season, a promotion and relegation scheme between the SPFL and the Highland and Lowland Leagues came into operation.\n\nRangers' record attendance of 118,567 is a British record for a league match.\n\nThe Scottish Professional Football League is a four tier football league system consisting of 42 teams. There are 12 team in the top tier, the Scottish Premiership, and 10 in each of the lower three tiers, named the Scottish Championship, Scottish League One and Scottish League Two.\n\nThe Scottish Premiership is the top league in Scotland, and consists of 12 teams. It has existed since 2013, when the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish Football League merged into the SPFL. The top tier of Scottish football is traditionally home to one of the world's most famous football rivalries, between Rangers and Celtic. Together the two clubs are known as the Old Firm, by virtue of the profitability of their rivalry. Rangers have won more top-flight, national league championships than any other club in the world (54 titles). Celtic were the first non-Latin and first team from Great Britain to win the European Cup, in 1967. The Old Firm rivalry was interrupted in 2012, when the company running Rangers went into liquidation and the club was forced to restart in the fourth tier of Scottish Football. The rivalry was resumed in September 2016, after Rangers had been promoted into the Scottish Premiership.\n\nThe second, third and fourth tiers in the league structure are called the Scottish Championship, Scottish League One and Scottish League Two respectively, each consisting of 10 teams. Teams are relegated and promoted between the divisions. Relegation from the fourth tier may occur at the end of every season (from 2014-15 thereafter); the last placed team in the fourth tier will enter a play-off with a team nominated by the SFA from outside the SPFL to determine which team enters League Two for the next season. Dismissal from the fourth tier is still possible, however, if a club finishes bottom three seasons in a row. In case of dismissal or withdrawal of a team (such as for economic reasons, etc.) a senior non-League level side can be elected in its place.\n\nThe top team in the Championship is eligible for promotion to the Premiership. Since the 2013-14 season, a second promotion place is available via play-offs between 3 Championship sides and 1 Premiership side. Falkirk were refused possible entry to the top tier in 2000 and 2003 due to not meeting the stadium requirements. Previously, requirements were that clubs had to have 10,000 seats in their ground, but this was changed to 6,000. Clubs must also have under-soil heating systems to prevent cancellation of matches caused by frozen pitches.\n\nQueen's Park, uniquely, is the only true amateur (players are not paid) member of the League still standing, having been a League member since 1900. In theory the club could qualify for Premiership promotion due to its use of Hampden Park, but they have not played in Scotland's top flight since the 1957–58 season.\n\nImmediately below the SPFL are two regionalised leagues:\n\n\nAt the end of the season a play-off is held between the champions of the Highland League and the Lowland League. The winner plays the bottom club in the SPFL League 2 for a place in League 2 in the following season.\n\nOther \"senior\" leagues are \n\nThere is no automatic promotion between these leagues and the Lowland or Highland Leagues, however a play-off takes place between the champions of the East of Scotland and South of Scotland for promotion to the Lowland League, if both clubs meet the licensing criteria.\n\nClubs at level 6 automatically enter the Scottish Cup Preliminary Rounds provided they are members of the Scottish Football Association.\n\nOperating separately from the SPFL professional leagues and the three 'senior' leagues, are the 'junior' leagues. Although called junior, this refers to the level of football played, not the age of the participants. The junior leagues are organised by the Scottish Junior Football Association and are regionalised into three areas, North, East and West. There is a Scottish Junior Cup which all members of the association participate in, having done so since the Nineteenth century.\n\nJunior clubs, unlike those in the senior non-league level, were not in the main eligible to participate in the Scottish Cup until 2007–08. The one previous exception to this rule, Girvan, participated in the Scottish Qualifying Cup (South) by virtue of the fact that they opted to switch from the senior level to the junior level, but still retained their right to attempt to qualify. From the 2007–08 Scottish Cup however, the winners of each of the three regional leagues and the winner of the Junior Cup will enter the first round of the Scottish Cup proper, following a decision by the SFA to allow them entry at their previous Annual General Meeting. Additional junior clubs (Linlithgow Rose, Banks o'Dee) have received an SFA licence which permits them to participate in the Scottish Cup.\n\nThere are a vast number of amateur footballers in Scotland. They play in leagues across the country of varying standard, usually confined to a specific localised geographic area. Many amateur clubs run teams in more than one of the amateur leagues. Some of the teams are well known with a history of success and producing players who go on to a higher level, such as Drumchapel Amateur. The activities of clubs at the amateur level are co-ordinated by the Scottish Amateur Football Association.\n\nThe winner of the Scottish Amateur Cup enters the Scottish FA Cup in the following season.\n\nThere are three categories of amateur football administered by the SAFA - \"Winter\" Saturday, \"Winter\" Sunday and Summer football. Summer football tends to be popular in the Northern and Western Isles and in the north of the mainland. In addition to the Scottish Amateur Cup (for 'Saturday' teams) there is the Scottish Sunday Amateur Trophy and the Highland Amateur Cup for summer teams.\n\nThe Scottish Cup is the world's oldest national cup but not the oldest competition, first contested in 1873 and being predated only by England's FA Cup. It is a pure knockout tournament with single matches, with replays being held if the first match is a tie. All 42 SPFL clubs automatically enter the tournament. A number of non-league clubs used to participate by virtue of having qualified through one of two regionalised qualifying cups (since 2007–08 they have qualified automatically for the First Round); or since 2007–08 by having won the Scottish Junior Cup or one of the three regionalised Junior leagues. The final is usually played at Hampden Park. The attendance of 146,433 for the 1937 Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and Aberdeen at Hampden Park is a European record for a club match.\n\nThe Scottish League Cup is open to members of the SPFL and the Highland League and Lowland League champions, and has been contested since the 1946–47 season.\n\nThe Scottish Challenge Cup is open to members of the SPFL clubs contesting in the Championship, League One & League Two and the top four clubs in the Highland League and Lowland League, and has been contested since the 1990–91 season.\n\nThe Scottish Junior Cup is contested by all members of the SJFA and has been competed for since the 1886–87 season. Currently, 163 teams are eligible to take part.\n\nThe Scottish Amateur Cup is the principal competition for amateur clubs, competed for since 1909-10. Currently around 600 clubs enter.\n\nThe Scottish Irn Bru Schools Cup is contested by Scotland's Schools and has been done since 1999. Currently 190 schools can take part.\n\nThree Scottish clubs have won UEFA competitions. Celtic won the 1967 European Cup Final, then lost the 1970 European Cup Final. The highest ever attendance for a UEFA competition match was in the 1969–70 European Cup semi-final at Hampden Park, Scotland's National stadium. A record 136,505 people attended that Cup semi-final played between Celtic and Leeds United. Celtic also reached the 2003 UEFA Cup Final, which they lost after extra time. Rangers won the 1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, and have also reached other finals, most recently the 2008 UEFA Cup Final. Aberdeen won the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final and then also won the consequent 1983 UEFA Super Cup. Both Celtic and Rangers have qualified for the knock out stages of the UEFA Champions League. Dundee United reached the 1987 UEFA Cup Final, which they lost to IFK Gothenburg, but their fans won an award for their good behaviour from UEFA. Celtic won a similar award after the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.\n\nThe Scottish national team represents Scotland in international football and is controlled by the Scottish Football Association. The team has played international football longer than any other nation in the world along with England, whom they played in the world's first international football match at Hamilton Crescent, Partick, Glasgow in 1872. Scotland have qualified for eight World Cups and two European Championships, but have never progressed beyond the first round.\n\nThe majority of Scotland's home matches are played at Hampden Park in Glasgow, opened in 1903. The Scottish team have become famous for their travelling support, known as the Tartan Army, who have won awards from UEFA for their combination of vocal support, friendly nature and charity work. The attendance of 149,415 for the Scotland vs. England match of 1937 at Hampden Park is also a European record.\n\nThe following articles detail the major results and events in each season since 1871-72. Each article provides the final league tables for that season, with the exception of the current one, as well as details on cup results, Scotland national football team results and a summary of any other important events during the season.\n\nAs in the men's game, the women's league structure consists of a Premier League and a Football League with Divisions One and Two, but the second division is split into North, West, and Central & East regions. In the women's SFL, reserve and youth squads may compete as long as they do not compete in the same division as the titular club. There are also four cup competitions, the Scottish Cup, Scottish Premier League Cup, Scottish First Division Cup and the Scottish Second Division Cup.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1963662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963662", "title": "Steve Long", "text": "Steve Long\n\n\"Big\" Steve Long (died October 28, 1868) was a western lawman and outlaw, achieving notoriety in the Wyoming Territory during the late 1860s. He was one of the earliest examples of an Old West gunman. Because of their lawlessness, he and two half-brothers were lynched by a posse put together by a newly appointed sheriff in 1868. \n\nLittle is known about Steve Long's early life or childhood. After the American Civil War, he had settled in Laramie, Wyoming. He and his half-brothers, Ace and Con Moyer, established a saloon together in the railroad town. Both Ace and Con helped found Laramie. Long reportedly had spent several years as an early version of a gunfighter before being elected in 1867 as Deputy Marshal of Laramie. \n\nIt is believed that Long had served during the Civil War, in the Confederate States Army, but under a different name. He migrated to Wyoming around 1866.\n\nLong soon earned a reputation as a particularly violent lawman, killing eight men in gunfights within two months. On October 22, 1867, Long opened fire on eight men during a street brawl after his orders to cease were ignored, killing five of the men. He rarely arrested anyone, choosing instead to either intimidate them with the threat of force or shoot them.\n\nLong and his brothers used their forceful personalities and his position as the Deputy Marshal to their own financial advantage. Within months of his gaining that position, they had forced several local ranchers to sign over to them the deeds to their properties. Several of those who refused were later confronted while alone by Long, who killed them, always claiming later that the other man had reached for a weapon. If the victim was not carrying a pistol or rifle, Long would place one on his person after killing him. There were never any witnesses. It is alleged that Long killed at least nine men in that fashion during a four-month period. Local residents called the saloon the \"Bucket of Blood\" because of the violence that often happened inside. \n\nBy October 1868, Long had killed thirteen men. Another seven men had been killed under suspicious circumstances, with Long suspected, but his role was never confirmed. There was no evidence to support his being named as the killer in these incidents. Long made little effort to find the alleged murderers, leading to speculation that he had committed those murders. Each of the seven men had been known to have refused to sign over land deeds to Long and his brothers. \n\nA local rancher and the first sheriff of Albany County, N. K. Boswell, organized several other ranchers to conspire against the three brothers. Boswell insisted that if they could watch Long closely enough, eventually they could catch him in the act of committing a crime. Then they could act against him with the law on their side. On October 18, 1868, Long attempted to rob a prospector named Rollie \"Hard Luck\" Harrison. Harrison drew a pistol, and a gunfight erupted between the two. Long was wounded and retreated. Harrison was killed, dying from his wounds before naming his assailant. .\n\nLong confessed to his fiancee how he became wounded, and she told N. K. Boswell. Boswell organized several men in the town. They entered the saloon owned by Long and his brothers on October 28. The posse overwhelmed the three and led them to an unfinished cabin in town. Long was quiet throughout the process. He asked only to be allowed to remove his boots, saying, \"My mother always said I'd die with my boots on\". He was lynched barefoot, hanged along with Con and Ace Moyer from the rafters of the cabin. There were no legal actions taken against the members of the lynch mob. A photograph of the three men after they were hanged was taken, and on the back was written, \"(1) Gunfighter \"Big\" Steve Long, (2) Con Moyer, (3) Ace Moyer, A lynching in Laramie Wyo. -1868- Con & Ace were founders of Laramie Wyoming!\". Following his death, Long's fiancee erected a marker in his memory.\n\n"}

{"id": "1963670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963670", "title": "Yixian Formation", "text": "Yixian Formation\n\nThe Yixian Formation () is a geological formation in Jinzhou, Liaoning, People's Republic of China, that spans 11 million years during the early Cretaceous period. It is known for its exquisitely preserved fossils, and is mainly composed of basalts interspersed with siliciclastic sediments.\n\nThe potential importance of the Yixian Formation was initially recognized during the time the Empire of Japan occupied China's Rehe (\"Jehol\") Province after the First battle of Hopei in 1933. Many Japanese scientists had noticed fossil remains of extinct fish and reptiles, possibly the champsosaurs. These initial fossil discoveries made by Japanese scientists vanished once World War II ended in 1945.\n\nBy 1949, when administration of the area passed to the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, the fossils of Yixian were studied only by Chinese scientists. It was not until the 1990s when remarkable fossils of birds and dinosaurs were excavated. Since 1996, a number of dinosaur fossils that have revolutionized knowledge of these animals have been found at Yixian; among them are the first known non-avian theropods with feathers. See Jehol Biota.\n\nFor some time, the formation was believed to be from the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous boundary, some 145 mya (million years ago). Radiometric dating has since resolved it to be younger; it is now considered to have been deposited in the Barremian to early Aptian, some 125–121 mya.\n\nThe Yixian Formation forms the lowest part of the Jehol group, defined by Gu (1962 and 1983) as a group of geological formations including the Jehol Coal-bearing Beds, the Jehol Oil Shale Beds, and the Jehol Volcanic Rocks. The Yixian Formation is preceded by the older Daohugou Beds, of uncertain Jurassic or Early Cretaceous age, which are sometimes considered part of the Jehol group. The Yixian Formation (including the synonymous Jingangshan, Tuhulu, Jianchang, Lower Volcanic and Volcanic Rock formations) is followed stratigraphically by the slightly younger Jiufotang Formation and the Fuxin Formation. Chiappe \"et al.\" argued in 1999 that the oldest beds of the Yixian (those bearing a fauna dominated by confuciusornithid birds) were best separated as a distinct formation, called the Chaomidianzi Formation, with a type locality at the village of Sihetun, approximately 25 km south of Beipiao City. However, this classification has fallen out of favor, and the Chaomidianzi Formation is disused as a synonym for the Jianshangou Bed of the Yixian Formation.\n\nThe Dabeigou Formation in Fengning, Hebei Province may immediately precede the Yixian, or it may be equivalent to the oldest Yixian beds. The Yixian also overlies the Tuchengzi Formation in places.\n\nThe Yixian Formation is divided into the following subunits, from most recent to oldest: (ages when available from Chang et al., 2009)\n\nNew high-precision 40Ar/39Ar dating provided ages of 125.8 ± 1.0 Ma and 126.0 ± 0.8 Ma for two basaltic samples from the Lujiatun Unit.\n\nThe Yixian Formation represents the second of three major faunal phases that characterize the Jehol Biota, mainly based on changes in invertebrate diversity. In the Yixian, ostracods (seed shrimp) had diversified considerably, despite a very low diversity in the earlier Dabeigou Formation. Other major invertebrate groups in the Yixian include clam shrimp and insects. Insects, as a group, experienced their largest diversification of the entire Mesozoic era in the Yixian. On the other hand, some invertebrate groups, such as bivalves and gastropods (snails and slugs), were numerous but low in diversity, being mainly represented by one or two dominant species (\"Arguniella\" in the case of the bivalves).\n\nStudies of vertebrates have shown support for the division of the Jehol into phases, and the diversity of fish in the Yixian was distinct from older and younger formations, with \"Lycoptera\" as the dominant species. The Yixian preserves the first Jehol dinosaurs and pterosaurs (which have not been found in the older Dabeigou Formation), and the first major radiation of birds (only one bird species is known from the Dabeigou). The Yixian also preserves the largest (and only) mammal radiation so far known from the Jehol group. Most vertebrates showed a tendency to climb trees or become arboreal, including many tree-dwelling birds, and climbing mammals and lizards.\n\nPlant life reached its Jehol biota peak in the Yixian. Five species of flowering plant were present (three of \"Archaefructus\", one of \"Archaeamphora\" and one of \"Hyrcantha\" (formerly \"Sinocarpus\"), as were a variety of horsetails that closely resembled modern species. It is possible that increasing animal and plant diversity were linked. The Yixian is characterized by extensive forests, dominated by trees such as ginkgoes, conifers, cycads, and seed fern trees. Ground cover plants included lycopods, horsetails, ferns, and primitive flowering plants, which were rare compared to the others.\n\nThis plant life grew around a series of freshwater lakes, provided with abundant minerals thanks to periodic volcanic eruptions. Volcanic activity, along with periodic wildfires, and noxious gasses released from the lake bottoms caused the ecosystem to be continually destroyed and regrown. This, along with the wide diversity of habitats in the surrounding region, may have contributed to the fast diversification of life forms present in the Yixian ecosystem.\n\nWith the diversity of plant life in the Yixian well known, including examples of a variety of petrified wood and growth rings, and with the help of chemical analysis, scientists have been able to determine the climate of the formation. The Yixian flora was dominated by conifers closely related to modern species that are found mainly in subtropical and temperate upland forests. The presence of ferns, cycads, and horsetails indicates a generally humid climate. However, evidence from the growth rings of petrified wood indicates that the humidity and water supply dropped regularly. This shows that the wet, humid conditions were punctuated by dry seasons, in which the environment became more arid. Evidence from the study of oxygen isotopes has shown that the average yearly temperature during this time period was 10 degrees celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit), significantly colder than once thought. This indicates a temperate climate with unusually cold winters for the generally warm Mesozoic era, possibly due to northern China's high latitude during this time. A study by Wu et al. (2013) concluded that orbital forcing, which is the effect on climate caused by shifts in the tilt of the Earth's axis and by the shape of the Earth's orbit, contributed to the climate fluctuations of this formation.\n\nThe Yixian Formation is well known for its great diversity of well-preserved specimens and its feathered dinosaurs, such as the large tyrannosauroid \"Yutyrannus\", the therizinosaur \"Beipiaosaurus\" and various small birds, along with a selection of non-theropod dinosaurs, such as \"Bolong\", \"Dongbeititan\" and \"Psittacosaurus\". Despite popular assumption, \"Microraptor\" does not hail from this formation, instead hailing from the younger Jiufotang Formation. However, other microraptorines, such as \"Sinornithosaurus\" and \"Graciliraptor\", did indeed inhabit the Yixian. Other biota included the troodontid \"Mei\", the dromaeosaurid \"Tianyuraptor\", the large compsognathid \"Sinocalliopteryx\" and the tyrannosauroid \"Dilong\".\n\n"}

At the beginning of the \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" TV series, Amuro is merely a 15-year-old civilian, along with his friends Fraw Bow and Hayato Kobayashi, living in Side 7, one of the few space colonies untouched by the One Year War at the time. Amuro is a talented amateur mechanic, which would be called an Otaku nowadays, and as a hobby designed the basketball-sized talking robot Haro. Born on Earth in Prince Rupert, Like his rival Char Aznable, Amuro got his own nickname during the One Year War: the . He was given this moniker after defeating 14 MS-09R Rick Doms in the Battle of Solomon. Amuro and Char Aznable faced off several times during the course of the One Year War, but it was not until when Lalah Sune was killed during one of their battles that this rivalry turned into a fierce hatred of one another. \n\nWhen Char Aznable attacks the colony, Side 7, all the officers on the \"White Base\" are incapacitated, leaving Ensign with the highest seniority on the ship, and he assumes command from the wounded Captain Paolo Cassius. After a series of close calls and with help from Amuro Ray and the Gundam, Bright brings the \"White Base\" safely to Federation headquarters at Jaburo. Because of the Zeon forces obsession with the \"White Base\", the Federation allows Bright to remain in command and sends the ship out as a decoy. Bright commands the \"White Base\" through several major operations in The One Year War, including the last stand of Zeon at asteroid A Baoa Qu. \n\n is Amuro's close friend and confidante, and devoted to his welfare. With Amuro's parents separated and his father Dr. Tem Ray frequently away on business for the Earth Federation's Project V, Fraw takes it upon herself to make sure that the perhaps charitably-described \"engineering nerd\" or \"mecha otaku\" eats, sleeps, bathes, lives in some degree of cleanliness, and—in her initial appearance—follows military evacuation orders. Fraw and Amuro become crew members of \"White Base\", along other Side 7 civilians. Becoming the primary caretaker of three young children, Katz Hawin, Letz Cofan, and Kikka Kitamoto, in addition to Amuro. As the distance between her and Amuro grows, Fraw joins the medical staff to help distract herself. She is married to Hayato some time after the One Year War. Fraw finishes the war serving on the ship's bridge as \"White Base\"s communications officer. \n\n is one of Amuro Ray's neighbors on Side 7. Short and stocky and with a tendency towards insecurity, Hayato often measures himself against his friend Amuro's accomplishments. After surviving the attack on his Side 7 home, Hayato becomes the co-pilot for the RX-75 Guntank alongside Ryu José, largely out of a sense of rivalry with Amuro. After Ryu sacrifices his life to save Amuro from Hamon Crowley, Hayato continues to pilot the Guntank after it is modified for use by a single person. \n\nAt the onset of the One Year War in UC 0079, Kai Shiden was living in the space colony Green Oasis in Bunch 1 of Side 7. Kai Shiden is tall and lanky in stature with a mop of gray hair, and his snarky and sarcastic personality often gets him scolded or slapped. After surviving the Zeon attack on Side 7, Kai became one of the many evacuees escaping on the Pegasus class assault carrier \"SCV-70 White Base\". However, due to a shortage of crew and soldiers to staff the warship, Kai was asked to become a pilot to help defend the \"White Base\" from frequent Zeon attacks. Kai was assigned to pilot the RX-77 Guncannon mobile suit, the unit he would remain in charge of for the rest of the One Year War.\n\nA natural coward, cynic, and pessimist, Kai could often be found on the sidelines making smart-alecky comments. His fighting style leaned towards bombarding foes with the Guncannon's long-range armaments, but when he got in a fix he was able to pull off hand-to-hand attacks with the Guncannon. He dislikes it when things move slowly. However, Kai quickly became disenchanted with war and he decided to desert the \"White Base\" when it was docked for repairs in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In Belfast, Kai meets a young girl named Miharu Ratokey who lives just outside the city, and agrees to sneak her onto the \"White Base\" and take her to the Earth Federation headquarters in Jaburo, located along the Amazon River in South America. Kai soon figures out that Miharu was actually a hired Zeon spy sent to infiltrate the \"White Base\" and discover Jaburo's location.\n\nDuring a sudden Zeon attack on the White Base while traveling over the Atlantic Ocean, Kai and Miharu go out in a Gunperry transport plane. During the battle, controls in the cockpit get stuck and Miharu goes down to help fire the plane's missiles manually. But she is knocked from the Gunperry by the missiles' exhaust blast, and falls out of the plane over the Atlantic Ocean. Miharu's death marks a turning point in Kai's development as he works through his grief.\n\n is one of the three White Base crew to display Newtype abilities, along with Amuro Ray and Sayla Mass. Mirai is a civilian who joins the White Base crew after the attack on Side 7. Her training as a space glider pilot makes her the best choice to take the White Base's helm, and Mirai soon becomes both Bright Noa's trusted deputy and a surrogate mother to the ship's young crew. She is also the daughter of a powerful and well-connected family, which causes complications later in the series when she is reunited with her fiancée Side 6's district attorney Cameron Bloom, whom she disliked as all he cared about was avoiding the war by fleeing to Side 6. Mirai was also briefly attracted to Sleggar Law but Sleggar pointed out that she was just too good for someone like him and Sleggar gave her the ring that belonged to his mother shortly before he died.\n\n is a medical student from the incomplete single space colony of the Earth Federation's Side 7 who ends up on the \"White Base\" along with other civilians including Amuro Ray, Fraw Bow, Hayato Kobayashi, Kai Shiden and Mirai Yashima. She would later be revealed to be ), the daughter of the Zeon Republic's founder Zeon Zum Deikun and the younger sister of Char Aznable. Sayla is almost immediately recruited as a soldier, and set to the task of watching over the civilian refugees. With the near total lack of experienced personnel to defend \"White Base\" (most original crew members were killed in the Principality of Zeon's attack on Side 7), Sayla first serves as acting captain Bright Noa's communications officer and later as a combat pilot.\n\n A large, stocky Latino man with a dusky complexion, Ryu was a test pilot-in-training for the Earth Federation on Side 7. When the colony was attacked by Char Aznable, Ryu took control of the Core Fighter jet to protect the White Base. Being a gentle, caring, considerate comrade, Ryu was the best mediator to ease the tension between the uptight Bright Noa and the young civilian recruits.\n\nRyu is killed during the White Base's attack from Crowley Hamon. Though critically wounded in firefights during Ramba Ral's attempted boarding attack, Ryu drives his Core Fighter kamikaze-style into Hamon's fighter in order to save the life of Amuro Ray and the crew of the White Base.\n\nHis death moves the entire crew of White Base to tears and the reality of war truly began to sink in, as everyone felt responsible for his death. Several crew members even try to call to his spirit for advice later on. Amuro is enraged when the only reward for Ryu's heroism is a three rank posthumous promotion at Jaburo.\n\nSleggar Law joins the \"White Base\" crew after they arrive at Jaburo. Sleggar initially looks down at the \"White Bases\" young crew, but soon develops a respect for them. He has a brief romance with Mirai Yashima. However, Sleggar feels that Mirai is too wonderful and deserves better than someone like him, so he rejects further advancement in their relationship. Shortly before his final sortie against the MA-08 Big Zam at the Battle of Solomon, Sleggar gives Mirai a ring that he inherited from his mother.\n\n is the commanding officer of the Earth Federation's \"Medea\" supply corps. At times Matilda also serves as a personal envoy for General Revil, carrying messages and orders from him to other ships. When the \"White Base\" is trapped in Zeon-controlled airspace over North America, it is the vital supplies delivered by the \"Medea\" supply corps, which has allowed the beleaguered assault carrier to make desperately needed repairs and escape over the Pacific Ocean. Due to her habits of showing up when the \"White Base\" is in a bind and helping them in whatever way she can, Miss Matilda has been looked to as the guardian angel of the vessel. Also due to her stunning beauty she becomes the dream girl of many of the young male crew members staffing the \"White Base\", especially the young Amuro Ray. Miss Matilda is engaged to Lieutenant Woody Malden, who was a chief military engineer stationed in the Earth Federation headquarters of Jaburo. When the ship reached Asia, Miss Matilda gave the \"White Base\" orders to head to Ukraine to take part in Operation Odessa, a large-scale military operation to wrest control of the mining facilities at Odessa away from the Principality of Zeon. However, en route to participate in the battle the \"White Base\" is attacked by the Zeon ace pilot trio, the Black Tri-Stars. In order to protect the \"White Base\", Matilda rammed her \"Medea\" into one of the Black Tri-Stars' MS-09 Doms, in an attempt to knock it down. But Dom pilot Ortega hit back, smashing the \"Medea\"'s cockpit so the transporter crashed into the ground exploding and killing Matilda instantly. Lieutenant Junior Grade Matilda Ajan was later listed as killed in action on November 6, U.C.0079. Afterwards, Amuro meets Matilda's fiance Lieutenant Woody in Jaburo and apologizes for not being able to protect Matilda, but Woody forgives him, since it was war, and she died protecting her friends' ship, \"The White Base\". During Char's assault on Jaburo Lieutenant Woody also dies while protecting the ship like his girlfriend did, as he attacked Char using a simple attack hoverfighter that was easily destroyed by Char's Z'Gok, but gave \"White Base\" crew members enough time to escape. \n\nAdmiral Revil (also referred to as General Revil) is one of the Earth Federation's leading Space Force commanders. He is mentioned often, but does not make any personal appearances until the latter half of the series. Before his appointment as head of the Earth Federation Space Force Revil was a Lieutenant General from the Earth Federation Ground Force. Revil's biggest claim to fame came after being captured by the Zeon's Black Tri-Stars after his flagship \"Ananke\" was sunk by Zeon's mobile suit attack forces during the Battle of Loum. Shortly thereafter, Revil, aided by Federal agents and sympathizers within Zeon, escaped to Side 6 and returned to the Federation. Broadcasting from Luna II, he made his famous \"\" speech from what he saw in Zeon during his capture. This speech boosted the morale of the Federation Forces, caused the Federation to toughen their stance, and resulted in the rejection of the terms of their surrender (it was said that Kycilia Zabi smashed the table in rage after hearing the news). Although this, both sides agreed to a ban on NBC weapons, colony drops and maltreatment of POWs by signing the Antarctic Treaty.\n\nLongtime friend of Zeon Zum Deikun, took in Deikun's two children, Casval and Artesia, after Deikun was assassinated. In order to protect them, the Ral family later sent them to live on Earth under the names Edward and Sayla Mass. Ramba Ral joined the Zeon military in Universal Century 0064. He quickly made himself known as a great tactician, and a master of guerrilla warfare. Ramba Ral first made a name for himself as an ace pilot in the Zeon mobile suit forces during the Battle of Loum where his impressive combat abilities and blue MS-04 Zaku I earned him the nickname . Ramba Ral is also sometimes referred to as the \"Great Blue Star\",\"guerrilla guy ral\" or the \"Blue Nova\". Ramba Ral stayed in space for the majority of the One Year War, however after the death of Garma Zabi during the pursuit of the Federation assault carrier \"White Base\" Ramba Ral is assigned to lead a Special Pursuit Force and is sent down to Earth on a \"Zanzibar\" mobile cruiser. Ramba Ral is ordered to avenge the death of Garma Zabi, and is given a new prototype ground-type mobile suit, the MS-07 Gouf, to do the job with. Soon after arriving on Earth, Ramba Ral decides to have a reconnaissance in force and attacks the \"White Base\" on an island in the North Pacific. Soon after gauging the attack strength of the warship and the Gundam, with guerrilla tactics, Ramba Ral retreats. The sheer power of Ramba Ral and his Gouf leave Gundam pilot Amuro Ray terrified. Traveling in a Gallop-Class Land Battleship, Ramba Ral continues to harass the \"White Base\" as it journeys across the vast deserts of Central Asia. During the second attack on the \"White Base\", Ramba Ral's wingmate Akos is killed, and Cozun is captured when his Zaku II is disabled and taken back on board the \"White Base\" by Amuro Ray piloting the Guncannon. When Cozun escapes from \"White Base's\" brig he contacts Ramba Ral and Ramba again attacks the \"White Base\" in his Gouf to conduct a rescue. However, Cozun is killed before he can safely escape and Ramba Ral's Gouf is disabled by the Gundam, forcing Ramba Ral to retreat. Not soon afterwards Ramba Ral meets Amuro Ray again (but did not recognize Amuro), who had deserted the \"White Base\" with the Gundam after dispute with the captain Bright Noa, and Fraw Bow (who came to drag Amuro back) in a small cafe in the desert town of Sodon. After recognizing Fraw Bow as a Federation soldier, Ramba Ral decides to release her and assigns his men to follow her back to the \"White Base\". When Ramba Ral's forces pinpoint s location they launch a surprise attack using guerrilla tactics. Amuro sees the Zeon mobilizing to launch their attack and he decides to come back with the Gundam for rescue. Amuro attacks Ramba Ral's Gouf and the two slash each other's cockpits open, the two of them realizing that they had just met each other in the cafe. Amuro is able to destroy the Gouf, but Ramba Ral is able to escape by leaping out of the gash in the cockpit hatch and swinging out of the way of the explosion on a grappling hook he had attached to the Gundam's arm. Following his defeat Ramba Ral is contacted by Dozle Zabi and told to contact M'Quve to receive support. However M'Quve refuses to supply Ramba Ral with the new Dom mobile suits he was instructed to give him. Realizing he is alone, Ramba decides that it is his duty as a soldier to do whatever he can to carry out his mission including the use of guerrilla tactics. While the Gallop and a Zaku II distract the White Base's mobile suits Ramba Ral and several of his soldiers attack the White Base in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat and successfully invade the ship. On board the ship Ramba Ral finds Sayla Mass and immediately recognizes her as Artesia Zum Deikun, and he tells her that he was a servant of her father. As Ramba Ral lets his guard down by talking he is shot by Ryu José, whom he also wounded. Wounded, Ramba Ral retreats into the White Bases secondary bridge and locks himself in. Captain Bright orders Amuro to destroy the secondary bridge, and Amuro tears a hole in the wall. Realizing he is trapped, Ramba Ral arms a grenade and leaps out of the hole, exploding in the Gundam's hand. Ramba Ral was killed in action on the 05th of November, Universal Century 0079.\n\nThe elegant and attractive serves as an aide to Ramba Ral. Crowley is also Ramba Ral's lover and he affectionately refers to her as \"Lady Hamon\". Crowley Hamon mainly stays on the bridge of the Gallop and helps to coordinate Ramba Ral's attacks during battle. After Ramba Ral's death, Hamon decides to attack the \"White Base\" and comes close to destroying the Gundam. However, a wounded Ryu Jose crashes his Core Fighter into the Magella Top, killing them both. \n\nComposing of three veteran pilots, , , and , the are one of Zeon's most famous group of ace pilots after Char Aznable. Prior to the beginning of the series, the Black Tri-Stars were responsible for the capture of Federation General Revil using their \"Jetstream Attack.\" Prior to the Earth Federation's assault on Odessa, the Black Tri-Stars were sent to Earth to reinforce Zeon's defenses. Despite being equipped with new MS-09 Dom mobile suits, each of the Black Tri-Stars were defeated by Amuro and the Gundam, however not before they managed to kill Matilda Ajan.\n\n was formally one of Zeon Zum Deikun's trusted allies, but apparently masterminded Deikun's death and used the murder his son Sasro to take over Zeon and establish it into a Principality to unite his people and achieves their ideals. However, Garma's death caused a despondent Degwin to gradually lose power to Gihren, who orchestrated his father's death when he attempted a final plea with the Federation's General Revil for peace.\n\n is the oldest son of Degwin and one of the heads of the Principality of Zeon, effectively taking over Zeon when his father withdraws from his daily duties following the death of Garma while warping Deikun's ideals to motivate the Zeon people into believing that they are the master race. After killing his father with the Solar Ray Cannon to keep the war going, Gihren is executed during the Battle of A Baoa Qu by Kycilia after admitting his act of patricide. Gihren's most notable scene is his speech at Garma's state funeral, possibly being the debut of the trademark salute \"Sieg Zeon!\" American Rock musician Andrew W.K. dubbed a famous speech of this character in his cover album \"Gundam Rock\" released during the 30th anniversary of the Gundam franchise.\n\nSasro Zabi, introduced in \"Gundam: The Origin\", is the 2nd born son of Dewgin who considered one of his family's prized members for being an adept manipulator of public opinion. This was shown by him using Deikun's death to stir anti-Federation propaganda among the Munzo citizens. Sasro was later killed in the car explosion that scarred his young brother Dozle. This incident was apparently caused by Kycilia in retaliation for Sasro slapping her earlier for allowing Deikun's family to take refuge in the Ral household. Sasro's death ultimately enabled the Zabis' rise to power.\n\n is Degwin's third born son and Zeon's Space Attack Force Commander, tasked during the One Year War to move fleets to and from various points in space to secure victory. Tall and burly, his face scarred from the explosion that killed his brother Sasro, Dozle casts a fearsome appearance at first glance but he is actually one of the more likable of the Zabi family as he a good man to his troops along with being devoted to his wife Zena and their baby daughter Mineva Lao Zabi. Dozle is closest to his younger brother Garma and actually looks forward to the day when Garma becomes an admiral in his own right. Dozle dismisses Char Aznable from his division, blaming him (though not suspecting him of foul play) for incompetence in the battle that resulted in Garma's death. Dozle especially despises his sister Kycilia and this feeling is only increased when she takes Char under her wing.\n\nDozle is revered by his troops in the Space Attack Force for personally leading them in battle. He and his bodyguard and close friend Shin Matsunaga were known to stage frontline \"inspections\" in his custom MS-06F Zaku II mobile suit, which typically became impromptu raids on nearby Earth Federation forces. Dozle's command center is located in the heart of the asteroid Solomon (later renamed Konpei Island by the Federation), and it is here that Dozle made his last stand. Late in UC0079 the Federation launched an offensive against Solomon, utilizing their remaining \"Salamis\" and \"Magellan\" class vessels.\n\nWhen the Federation's \"Public\" class assault ships successfully deployed their beam dispersion smoke, Dozle ordered the mandatory evacuation of all non-essential personnel. At the same time the Federation deployed its first Solar System array at Solomon, which destroyed anything attempting to leave.\n\nDozle mounted his own mobile armour, the MA-08 Big Zam, and flew out to buy time for the evacuees, and shortly thereafter was engaged by the Federation's Gundam mobile suit. During battle his Big Zam's I-Field generator is disabled by a kamikaze attack from a core fighter, and his Big Zam is finally disabled by the Gundam. Dozle then exists the Big Zam's cockpit and fires a machinegun at the Gundam, causing Amuro to temporarily be stricken with fear and doubt. He was caught in the subsequent explosion of the Big Zam and killed. His death marked the beginning of the end for Zeon forces in space.\n\n is the only daughter of Degwin Sodo Zabi who desires to be taken seriously, fiercely loyal to her people and subordinates yet an utterly merciless manipulator. Initially a security official in the Zeon homeland at the time of Zeon Zum Deikun's death, having her older brother Sasro Zabi killed for him slapping her over letting Deikun's children be sheltered by the Ral family, Kycilia is tasked with eliminating Deikun's family and loyalists. During the One War Year, placed in charge of Zeon's Mobile Suit Forces, Kycilia shows herself able to adapt to the changing technology while equally proficient in intelligence gathering while establishing numerous elite mobile suit units. She would later take Char Aznable under her wing, unaware that he is actually Casval Deikun whom she assumed to have killed. During the Battle of A Baoa Qu, Kycilia took full command of Zeon after executing Gihren upon learning that he killed their father. Losing the support of Gihren's loyalists, Kycilia orders her remaining forces to fall back and ends up being killed when Char fires a rocket launcher at her through the window of her flagship \"Chimera\", which the Federation warships destroyed moments after.\n\n is the youngest son of Degwin Sodo Zabi, commander of Zeon forces in North America, and academy classmate and friend of Char Aznable. Garma first appears after Char forces the Federation ship \"White Base\" off course during reentry into Earth's atmosphere and landed the heart of Zeon-controlled territory. Eager to prove himself to his older sister Kycilia, Garma pursues \"White Base\" with the full support of Char, unaware of Char's treachery. In a last attempt to prevent \"White Base\" from escaping, Garma personally leads another attack to capture the Federation ship. However, Char intentionally misdirects the Zeon forces, allowing \"White Base\" to attack Garma's Gaw air carrier from behind. Shocked by Char's treachery, Garma turns the Gaw around and attempts to ram \"White Base\", only to fall short. Garma's death sends shock waves though the Zeon forces, especially his father, Degwin Sodo, and older brother, Dozle. During Garma's state funeral, eldest brother Gihren uses Garma's death as propaganda to rally the Zeon forces to continue fighting.\n\nLalah is a young woman who is the \"star student\" of Professor Flanagan due to her strong Newtype abilities, and as such is also one of the key test subjects in the development of Newtype-related weaponry. Being one of the earliest and most successful known Newtypes, her powers are accompanied by a profound spiritual awareness.\n\nDespite her gentle nature, Lalah is fiercely loyal to the man who saved her life —- Char Aznable, the scheming \"Red Comet\". In the novel he found her in an Indian brothel where she worked after losing her parents in the war. In the MSG:Origin, episode 7:Encounter with Lalah, her parents were alive and she was sending money to them from her work helping a mobster win at gambling, this attracts a mob called Manaus, and Char takes her away using a Mobile worker. She was assigned to pilot the Newtype use mobile armor MAN-08 Elmeth as a part of the Newtype research project conducted by the Flanagan Institute. Lalah is ranked as an ensign under Char.\n\nLalah and Amuro Ray first met on Side 6, where Amuro found Lalah in front of a lakeside house. They spoke briefly and Amuro was attracted to her with his Newtype powers. They met again sometime later when Amuro's car got stuck in the mud. Another vehicle pulled over and offered to help him, aboard it was Lalah and Char Aznable, Amuro's archrival (the two had not yet seen each other face to face). Amuro immediately recognised both of them, but Char and Lalah had yet to figure out Amuro's identity.\n\nLalah left a profound impact on Amuro and was considered his first great love. During the Elmeth's test run which saw its Newtype \"bits\" weaponry wreak havoc on the Federal Fleet guarding the newly captured Zeon base Solomon, Amuro in the Gundam engaged the Elmeth but found out the pilot was Lalah. Both then realized they were soulmates and shared a \"Newtype bonding\", a sort of telepathic bond. Unfortunately Char arrived and chastised Lalah for \"consorting with the enemy\" and raised his beam naginata to strike down Amuro's wingman Sayla Mass, piloting the CoreBooster jet. Lalah told Char to stop; for she sensed the pilot was Char's sister Artesia (Sayla Mass is her adopted name since young). Char hesitated but this gave Amuro the opportunity to sever the weapon arm of Char's Gelgoog, rendering it incapacitated. Amuro went for the killing blow but Lalah knocked away Char and took the fatal strike. This has a profound effect on both men, as their rivalry escalates from a professional to a very personal one which culminated in the movie \"Char's Counterattack\".\n\nAlthough she died before the end of the One Year War, Lalah Sune's spirit occasionally returns from beyond the grave to haunt both Char and Amuro Ray, as seen in \"Char's Counterattack\".\n\n is a colonel for the Zeon ground forces under the command of Kycilia Zabi and supervises mining operations and supplies for the war effort. Decadent and amoral, M'quve fancies crystal vases, which he collects, in particular a Song Dynasty porcelain vase he acquired (which he intended to give to Kycilia Zabi as a present). He sees Char Aznable as somewhat of a rival and upstart. Upon destruction of his Odessa Base operating in Europe by the Earth Federation Forces, M'quve flees to space where he eventually meets the \"White Base\" and Amuro Ray's Gundam in battle at Texas Colony. There, M'quve pilots a melee-customized mobile suit, a prototype YMS-15 Gyan, and faces Amuro personally, only to be defeated and killed.\n"}
{"id": "1963675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963675", "title": "Nightingale (band)", "text": "Nightingale (band)\n\nNightingale is a Swedish progressive rock/metal band from Örebro in Sweden.\n\nNightingale began in 1995 as a solo goth rock project of Dan Swanö, designed to explore his brief fascination with the genre, also evident on Edge of Sanity tracks such as \"Sacrificed\". The first album \"The Breathing Shadow\" was recorded and mastered by Swanö alone in the space of a week at his home Unisound studio, and has been described by some as a tribute to legendary goth rock band The Sisters of Mercy, whose sound it does indeed resemble. The second album \"The Closing Chronicles\" was recorded in April 1996 with his brother Dag acting as producer and contributing some guitar parts. Unlike the first album, it is somewhat influenced by progressive rock and heavy metal, and continues the conceptual storyline that began in \"The Breathing Shadow\" to the logical conclusion of the central characters' death, as it was intended to be the last Nightingale album.\n\nAfter this the band went on semi-hiatus, playing a couple of live concerts in small venues around Örebro with future permanent band member Erik Oskarsson on bass and Ari Halinoja playing the drums. The second concert, in October 1998 is remarkable because it was one of the few times Edge of Sanity songs were performed live by Swanö, the band adding two lighter tracks to bulk out their set (Swanö scarcely performed live with Edge of Sanity, citing his inability to sustain death metal vocals for long enough).\n\nThe band returned to Unisound in April 1999 to expand upon a lost demo of the track \"I Return\" recorded by Dan and Dag in September 1998. The album \"\"I\"\" from 2000 is a prequel to the first two albums, half composed by Dan and half by Dag, several of the tracks, such as \"Alonely\" and \"Dead or Alive\" being recycled by Dag from previously abandoned projects and given new lyrics (the originals being both written in Swedish and outside the conceptual storyline). For the recording of \"Alive Again\" in May 2002 (a sequel to the original Breathing Shadow Trilogy of \"I\", \"The Breathing Shadow\" and \"The Closing Chronicles\") the band was filled out with Tom Björn on drums and Erik Oskarsson returning as a permanent member. This record received the most critical acclaim yet upon its release in February 2003, partly owing to the increased exposure caused by their signing of a distribution deal with American label The End Records. They played a series of live shows before travelling to Västerås in June 2004 to record \"Invisible\", which is the band's first departure from their conceptual storyline approach, dealing with a wide array of topics from love to history. Before going on their first major tour, the band re-recorded a set of tracks for a best-of album, \"Nightfall Overture\", containing songs from their first four conceptual albums, an Edge of Sanity track and one new Nightingale song.\nIn 2006 the band concluded the second and last day of the international progressive rock festival, InProg 2006. \n\nLater that year Dag stated on his website that he will no longer be using his alias Tom Nouga;\nThe band's sixth album \"White Darkness\" was released 4 June 2007.\n\nOn October 19, 2014, Nightingale released their seventh studio album entitled \"Retribution\", a follow-up to 2007's \"White Darkness\" through the band's new worldwide label InsideOut Music on November 10, 2014 in Europe and January 25, 2015 in North America.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1963680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963680", "title": "Pauline Fowler", "text": "Pauline Fowler\n\nPauline Fowler is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", a long-running serial drama about working class life in the fictional London borough of Walford. She was played by actress Wendy Richard between the first episode on 19 February 1985 and 25 December 2006. Pauline was created by scriptwriter Tony Holland and producer Julia Smith as one of \"EastEnders' \"original characters. She made her debut in the soap's first episode on 19 February 1985, and remained for twenty-one years and ten months, making her the second longest-running original character, surpassed only by her nephew, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt).\n\nPauline is a member of the Beale family. Her storylines focus on drudgery, money worries and family troubles. The matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London community of Albert Square, she is portrayed as a loving, doting mother who is very family-oriented. In later years however, she becomes a more stoic, opinionated battle-axe who alienates her relatives through overbearing interference. Pauline is married to the downtrodden Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), though she finds out he has had a one-night stand with Christine Hewitt (Elizabeth Power) which leads to her hitting him with a frying pan. Their marriage remains rocky until his death in 1996. She is used for comedic purposes in scenes with her launderette colleague, Dot Cotton (June Brown), and scriptwriters included many feuds in her narrative, most notably with her daughter-in-law, Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), a family friend who got her daughter, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), pregnant at 16. A famous episode in 1986, which includes Pauline discovering that Den is the father of Michelle's baby, drew over 30 million viewers, and was listed at number 36 in \"The Times\"' 1998 list of \"Top 100 cult moments in Film\". Richard announced Pauline's retirement from the serial in July 2006, and the character was killed off in a \"whodunnit?\" murder storyline, with Richard making her final appearance on 25 December 2006.\n\nPauline was a staple in the UK press during her time in \"EastEnders\", representative of the symbiosis between Britain's soaps and tabloid newspapers. Widely read tabloids, such as \"The Sun\" and \"Daily Mirror\", would routinely publish articles about forthcoming developments in Pauline's storylines. Critical opinion on the character differs. She has been described as a \"legend\" and a television icon, but was also voted the 35th \"most annoying person of 2006\" (being the only fictional character to appear on the list). The character is well-known even outside of the show's viewer-base, and away from the on-screen serial, Pauline has been the subject of television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books, tie-in novels, and comedy sketch shows.\n\nPauline Fowler is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of \"EastEnders\", Tony Holland (1940–2007) and Julia Smith (1927–1997). Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming three of the original characters after his own relatives, specifically his aunt Lou and her children, Holland's cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline. This family setup of a woman named Lou Beale, with twin children Pete and Pauline, was recreated on-screen as the first family of \"EastEnders\", the Beales and Fowlers.\n\nPauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appears in an abridged form in their book, \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\".\n\nFrom the beginning, Smith considered the role ideal for Wendy Richard, with whom she had worked on the 1960s BBC soap, \"The Newcomers\"; Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use \"stars\"—Richard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as Shirley Brahms in the successful sitcom \"Are You Being Served?\" At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not \"duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects.\" In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that \"powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened\" had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, \"If I accepted, my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the launderette, voted Labour and supported Arsenal. She was married to Arthur, who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life.\" Richard thought it sounded like a challenging role.\n\nThere were initial fears that Richard's glamorous image would not work for the character and Smith also feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. Richard has commented, \"although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever ... I knew right away I would be mad to turn down the part of Pauline.\"\n\nAfter she accepted the role, Richard was told by Julia Smith that she would have to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, \"I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed ... I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut.\" From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: \"It was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations' ... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have.\" Richard's casting was considered to be \"a giant leap of faith\" by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately \"landed on its feet\", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in \"EastEnders\"' history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.\n\nThe character of Pauline was a cornerstone of \"EastEnders\"; the lynchpin of the Fowler/Beale family around whom the soap was originally structured. At the beginning of the serial in 1985, Pauline was a 40-year-old married mother with two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, and another child on the way. The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\", and the second tie-in novel by Hugh Miller, \"Swings and Roundabouts\", which explains that Pauline was born and raised at 45 Albert Square, where she lived for her entire life. She married Arthur Fowler in 1965, raising her own children in the same house where she grew up.\n\nWhereas most of the other female characters in \"EastEnders\" were portrayed in a somewhat more glamorous working class way, Pauline Fowler was the exception to the rule, being the sole character to represent the \"homely and domestic\" side of the Beale family. As the serial progressed, the character altered from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre battle-axe, hardened by a life of misery in Albert Square. Other characters refer to her as \"Fowler the growler\", and in the \"Evening Gazette\" she was described as \"the Boadicea of battle-axes.\" The initial change in her demeanour is traced back to the death of her mother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing), a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a \"rod of iron\". Following Lou's screen funeral in July 1988, Pauline retorts, \"Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow,\" a line that was used similarly by Lou in the episode that preceded her own death. This parallel symbolised the transference of the family's matriarchal role from Lou to Pauline. Wendy Richard has indicated that both she and show creator, Julia Smith, had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother, and former \"EastEnders\" executive producer John Yorke has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: \"[Pauline] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as her mother did before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death.\"\n\nIn the first episode, it is revealed that Pauline, aged 40, is pregnant with her third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother's opposition, is determined to keep the baby. The storyline was used to spread a public message on the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing amniocentesis tests. The storyline culminates with the birth of the serial's first baby, Martin, in July 1985.\n\nPauline's early storylines concentrate on family and money troubles: coping with her husband Arthur's redundancy, mental breakdown and imprisonment; eldest son Mark's delinquency; and daughter Michelle's teenage pregnancy.\nIn 1989, the character was used to highlight another important gynaecological health issue, fibroids. The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as chronic fatigue, and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when the character Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) knocks her down in his Austin Mini. In the 1989 Boxing Day episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary hysterectomy. Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision that had been made by the show's boss, Mike Gibbon, to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, Michael Ferguson, decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.\n\nPauline's marriage to the luckless Arthur is central to her character, remaining one of her defining traits even after his death in 1996. The dynamics of the relationship were clear from the beginning of the programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that holds the Fowler family together, while Arthur is depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the programme, has commented that \"[Pauline and Arthur] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man ... Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy, while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression.\"\nPauline and Arthur were generally seen as the most stable couple in the show, so Arthur's affair with Christine Hewitt (Lizzie Power) came as a shock to viewers. The storyline was long-running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employs Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance between Arthur and Christine steadily develops throughout the year, facilitated by Pauline's lengthy absence—she is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother Kenny in early June, and she does not return until late September—in reality, Wendy Richard had to be temporarily written out of \"EastEnders\" to allow her to act in \"Grace and Favour\". The build-up to the affair contains many twists and turns, starting with Arthur's rebuff of Christine's advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinces Pauline of Arthur's innocence and leaves her feeling \"strangely sorry for the pathetic, lonely figure, who obviously drank too much\". The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992.\n\nThe storyline continued throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater demands on Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless he does so himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; \"should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?\" In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, \"an act of betrayal on a massive scale.\" Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this \"iconic\" scene: \"It was one of the few times when you saw Pauline really, really let rip ... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did.\" This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in \"EastEnders: The First Ten Years\" and is described by Wendy Richard as \"Pauline's crowning moment.\"\n\nFor a while it seems that \"EastEnders\"' \"most solid\" marriage is over, but Arthur spends the rest of 1993 trying to convince Pauline that it is worth saving and they eventually reconcile. However, more tragedy follows, when Arthur is framed by a conman, Willy Roper (dubbed \"Wicked Willy\" by the British press), and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995. The storyline captured the public's imagination and a nationwide \"Free Arthur Fowler\" campaign was launched. \"Arthur Fowler Is Innocent\" T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the UK singles chart promoting the campaign.\n\nArthur's imprisonment was a precursor to the final exit of actor Bill Treacher, who decided to leave \"EastEnders\" after 11 years playing Arthur. While Arthur goes to pieces in prison, Pauline is heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovers his deception and then resorts to uncharacteristic seduction to gain his confession. A critic for the \"Sunday Mirror\" commented, \"Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in \"EastEnders\". The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole was nothing short of brilliant.\" Arthur is exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline is brief, as an injury he sustained in prison leads to a brain haemorrhage and he dies shortly after his release. His death ends an 11-year screen marriage, the longest run of any marriage in the serial.\n\nPauline remains a family-oriented character throughout the course of the show. A \"fiercely loyal, but overbearing mother\"; sheltering and taking on the major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing the importance of family. She is portrayed as a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs—the first to criticise, but also the first to defend her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. The quintessential matriarch, she has also been compared with Queen Elizabeth, with the storylines in the fictional Albert Square, mirroring the troubles of England as a whole. In \"Monarchies: What Are Kings and Queens For\", the author points out similarities between the matriarchal nature of Pauline's character, and that of the Queen. \"Both exhibit a rich mix of suffering and duty. Pauline has tried to bring up her family as best she can, even though it hasn't always been easy. Her offspring have caused her nothing but trials and tribulations; her husband has been wayward at times and caused her several eyebrow-raising moments. But Pauline has steadfastly carried on ...\"\n\nEarly storylines between Pauline and her two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, show her to be a doting mother, forgiving of Mark's wayward behaviour, and supportive when Michelle decides to become a teenage mum. Pauline is devoted to her twin brother Pete, dutiful to her mother Lou, allegiant to her husband Arthur, and a shoulder for her nephew, Ian, to cry on. Wendy Richard commented in 1990, \"It's important for her to keep the family together. That's why when her problem son Mark suddenly came home [in 1990], it was like her winning the pools ... She had to take a lot of shocks from Michelle and I think she coped remarkably well.\"\n\nAs the serial progressed, Pauline contends with a plethora of family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, attracting 19 million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: \"To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment.\" The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles to come to terms with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when \"EastEnders\" tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: \"The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS are not exactly the same thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across.\"\n\nThe HIV storyline came to an end on-screen in 2003, when executive producer Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: \"I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go.\" Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.\n\nIn the latter years of her time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more inflexible battle-axe. Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to release control over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's \"dutiful son\", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality Paul O'Grady addressed Pauline's refusal to \"share her son like a normal mother\", commenting, \"she's suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's hanging onto the last [son] like a mother tiger with her cub.\"\n\nThe character's narrative also included various feuds, most notably with the soap's lothario Den Watts, a family-friend who gets Pauline's daughter Michelle pregnant at the age of 16. \"EastEnders\" pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when over 30 million people watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode in which Pauline discovers that Den is the father of her granddaughter, Vicki. Wendy Richard has commented on the hostility between the characters \"once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was out to get him one way or another\" and actor Leslie Grantham, who played Den, added \"from then on it was out and out war, which was great!\" An array of confrontations between Den and Pauline occur, as she tries to force him to leave Walford and keep him away from her family. The feud appears to end in 1989 when the character Den is shot and presumed dead, but it is ignited once again in 2003 when Den is re-introduced, 14 years after he supposedly died. 2005 saw Den killed off for the final time, and although Pauline is not directly responsible for killing him, the item used to bludgeon him to death turns out to be her dog-shaped iron doorstop, which has been described as \"a nice touch of pathos\".\n\nA large proportion of the character's scenes take place on the set of Walford's launderette, where Pauline works as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in \"EastEnders\". Here, Pauline is frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Dot Cotton. The two characters share one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together are often used to provide humour. Particular emphasis is placed on their differences, which lead to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 sees them \"buried alive\" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot are most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality Paul O'Grady as a \"fabulous double-act\": \"Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else.\"\n\nPauline is shown to be particularly hostile to the various female characters that feature in her sons' lives, and she epitomises the archetypal \"mother-in-law from hell\". One of Pauline's most notable feuds is with her youngest son Martin's wife, Sonia. Animosity between the characters begins in 2000, when Sonia gives birth to Pauline's grandchild and decides to give the baby Chloe (later renamed Rebecca) up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort \"YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!\" The feuding over Chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline is shown to visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin's wishes, and then, following Sonia's affair with Naomi Julien, Pauline refuses to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regains custody. Critic for \"The Guardian\", Grace Dent, commented \"At one point, you couldn't move around Walford for hitmen and gangsters, but now they've all been written out ... leaving Pauline Fowler to reign the square like sodding Pablo Escobar in a sky-blue tabard and ski-pants, decreeing who can see their own kids, who can drink where and what everyone's eating in the cafe so as they won't spoil their teas. If I was Sonia, I'd have ransacked the hospital's dangerous drugs box by now and given that old crone a renal meltdown.\" Various rows, slaps and insults were featured between the characters, caused by Pauline's continuous interference in Sonia's relationships with Martin and Rebecca. As Martin began to cede, allowing Sonia access to their daughter, Pauline was shown to concoct ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement.\n\nDuring her latter years in \"EastEnders\", Pauline is rarely without her Cairn Terrier, Betty. The dog is a stray taken in by the Fowler family in 2004, who quickly becomes Pauline's inseparable sidekick. Wendy Richard has since revealed that it was her decision for Pauline to own a Cairn: \"When EastEnders asked if Pauline should have a dog I said it had to be a Cairn Terrier—and Betty joined us! She's wonderful, she loves me and I love her.\" In the on-screen story, the dog is named after Pauline's aunt Betty, but in reality, Wendy Richard named her after Mollie Sugden's fictional character Betty Slocombe, who appeared along with Richard's Shirley Brahms in the sitcom, \"Are You Being Served?\"\n\nSeveral eligible bachelors are shown to express their interest in Pauline over the years, including the characters Derek Taylor in 1987, Danny Taurus in 1993, Jeff Healy (who proposes) in 1999, Eddie Skinner in 2000, and Terry Raymond, with whom she goes on a blind date in 2001. However, the character remains staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory, refusing to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. In 2001 Derek Harkinson (Ian Lavender) is introduced, an old school friend of Pauline's. Initial scripts indicated that Derek was being groomed as a romantic interest for Pauline, which she is shown to welcome. However, the storyline takes a twist when he reveals, to her shock, that he is gay. 2002 sees Derek move in with the Fowler family, unconventionally settling into the show as a replacement father figure for Mark and Martin and as Pauline's best friend. \n\nIn 2005, Pauline embarks on a romance with a new character, Joe Macer (Ray Brooks), whom she meets at salsa classes. A relationship develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe was an attempt to give the character a \"new lease of life\", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with \"EastEnders\"' 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the \"Fowler\" surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving \"EastEnders\". Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe \"looked good together\" and felt that she and Brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a \"realistic-looking couple.\"\n\nWithin the storyline, just two months after the wedding, Pauline's marriage is shown to sour after she discovers Joe's criminal past. Their relationship steadily deteriorates throughout the year, and in December 2006 Pauline ends the marriage—removing her wedding ring and informing Joe that he \"was half the man that Arthur had been, that she had never really loved him and that their sex life was a sham.\" The resulting row sees Joe insult Pauline's family—suggesting that her \"perfect marriage\" with Arthur was \"nothing but a fantasy\" and branding Mark \"diseased\", Michelle a \"scrubber\" and Arthur a \"con\"—to which Pauline responds by smashing a plate over his head. Wendy Richard commented, \"It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man. That is what caused the marriage to be a non-starter. Pauline was not mean to Joe, he used her ... and lied to her.\"\n\nViewers saw the slow build-up to Pauline's climactic exit throughout the latter part of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: \"she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia is more than just a thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times ... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story.\"\n\nThe character was killed off in a dramatic storyline, which aired on Christmas Day 2006 and was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers. The episode sees Sonia denouncing Pauline as \"sick\" for not wanting to share her son with the woman he loved, to which Pauline retorts, \"I'll tell you what's sick. You. Daughter of a scrubber, lesbian, under-age mother who gave away her own baby.\" The row culminates with Sonia slapping Pauline, causing her to fall to the floor and break the Fowler fruit bowl—\"the enduring symbol of her family, which smashed, significantly, into smithereens.\" Though Pauline resolves to stay and reunite with her family in the end, she does not get the chance, as she collapses and dies in the middle of Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise.\n\nThe Christmas Day episodes, written by Simon Ashdown, drew on the show's early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for \"The Times\", Tim Teeman, commented that \"Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl.\" In addition, her parting scene with the other \"EastEnders\" long-serving \"grand dame\" Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: \"The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot ... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved.\"\n\nRichard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure. She has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's \"changing character\" and \"depressing final storyline\". In an interview with the Biography Channel she explained: \"I did say, promise me you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did ... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character ... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That's what [show creator] Julia Smith wanted, and that's what I felt was right, so I resigned ... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now ... There was so much history with that family.\"\n\nThe storyline continued into 2007, as first Pauline's funeral is interrupted by the police in order to perform an autopsy on her body, and then Pauline's nemesis Sonia is arrested for the murder. It is later revealed that the killing blow had actually come from Pauline's husband Joe, who breaks down and confesses to Dot that he had rowed with Pauline on Christmas Day (off-screen) and, in a fury, struck her across the head with a frying pan, causing a brain haemorrhage that claimed her life. The plot's eventual climax in February 2007 led to the exits of several established characters connected with Pauline. This included Martin, Sonia, and Joe, who is dramatically killed off after confessing to Pauline's murder, by falling out of the Fowlers' first floor window while trying to apprehend a hysterical Dot. Pauline is cremated, and her ashes buried at Arthur's graveside, by Dot, in an episode that aired in June 2007.\n\nAs a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special television programme, \"EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline\", which provided an emotional look back at Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and \"EastEnders\" actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how \"proud\" she was of her character, commenting: \"Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems ... She wasn't always grumpy ... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame ... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That was the most important thing in her life.\"\n\nAt the time of her departure from the serial, Pauline was the second-longest running character to feature in \"EastEnders\" and one of only two original characters to remain in the show for almost 22 years. Her baggy woolly cardigan and long-suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution, a \"soap legend\" and a \"television icon\". Actress Wendy Richard was awarded an Order of the British Empire MBE medal in 2000 by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, and when the Queen visited the set of \"EastEnders\" in 2001, Wendy Richard was the first actress introduced, who then accompanied her and Prince Philip on their tour of the set.\n\nDespite being popular with many, the character of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism has been given to the character's dowdy attire, particularly the perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan; a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes. In addition, Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour—\"a face like a month of wet weekends\" and \"a voice that could curdle milk.\" She has been described as the \"Wicked Witch of Walford\" and \"a character who became a byword for downtrodden haggery.\"\n\nLucy Mangan, the culture critic from \"The Guardian\" newspaper, summed up the character: \"Pauline Fowler is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable ... She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for \"EastEnders\", but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show.\" This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a BBC Three poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list. In a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would most like to see retired. She came third in the poll, behind \"EastEnders\"' Den Watts (17%) and \"Coronation Street's\" Ken Barlow (15%).\n\nAlthough it had been suggested that Pauline's presence in \"EastEnders\" was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike. In a report for BBC News, one viewer commented \"it's so sad, because I've watched her for 20 years. She's such a large character\", and another said \"If she goes then I think \"EastEnders\" is finished.\" BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard \"occupies a huge place in people's hearts\", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, \"For many years Wendy simply was \"EastEnders\" for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the \"EastEnders\"' spirit ... We thank her for everything she has done for the show.\"\n\n\"Inside Soap\" editor, Steven Murphy, said that the fact Pauline has been such an \"enduring staple\" will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. \"It's huge in soap terms ... She's a character people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever.\" When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: \"characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [EastEnders] has very few of those now.\" Jonathan Hughes, editor of \"All About Soap\" magazine, added \"[Pauline's] an absolute legend ... You can't imagine the show without her ... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of \"EastEnders\" for so many years.\" However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting \"How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [getting rid of her]. Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago\".\n\nPauline's exit in December 2006 was described by \"The Times\" critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a \"significant sayonara\". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as \"the most moving in a soap this year\" and added that \"it was a delight to finally alight on an episode ... that was so satisfying.\" Conversely, Pauline's exit was described as a \"mess\" by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the \"Sunday Mirror\" newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: \"the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead.\"\n\nTo mark Pauline's 22-year reign in \"EastEnders\", Wendy Richard was awarded with a 'Lifetime Achievement' award at the British Soap Awards in May 2007. The award was presented by Todd Carty, who played her on-screen son Mark. Carty described Richard as the \"heart and soul of \"EastEnders\"\" and hailed her as an inspiration to everyone in the \"EastEnders\" cast. Richard was moved to tears when she collected the award.\n\nWhen the series was launching in 1985, since Wendy Richard was the most recognisable actor from the original cast, she and her character Pauline were used heavily to promote \"EastEnders\" in the media. Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to narrate a special \"dial-a-soap\" service for \"EastEnders\". Run by British Telecom, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update, up to 88 seconds long. It was the first television show to provide such a service. Between 1985 and 2006, Pauline was featured in much \"EastEnders\"-related merchandise and promotional material, including calendars, cast-cards, annuals, novels, a knitting pattern book and a greeting card.\n\nThe well-known character of Pauline Fowler has also been referenced in various television programmes, unrelated to the \"EastEnders\" universe. In 1997 she was mentioned in an episode of the successful BBC drama \"This Life\". Two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watch an episode of \"EastEnders\" on television and mock Pauline's hysterics and her well-documented tendency to wear cardigans. The character was also regularly spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show, \"The Real McCoy\" (1991–1995). One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of \"EastEnders\", with black comedians taking over roles of well known \"EastEnders\" characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian Llewella Gideon played the role of Pauline. The sketches placed considerable emphasis on the character's high-pitched voice and her tendency to whine. The character's fashion sense has also been referred to in BBC Two sitcom \"Beautiful People\" (2008).\n\n\n"}

They played at Edmonton Gardens in Edmonton, Alberta, and later Northlands Coliseum. In 1976 they moved to Portland, Oregon to become the Portland Winter Hawks. A second incarnation of the team played only one season in 1977–78 before moving to Great Falls, Montana.\n\nThe Edmonton Oil Kings have a history that predates the founding of the Western Hockey League. They won the Memorial Cup in 1963 and 1966 as members of the senior men's Central Alberta Hockey League. The team was required to defeat the Alberta Junior Hockey League champion to earn the right to play for the national junior championship. They were also cup finalists seven different years between 1954 and 1971.\n\nIn 1966, Bill Hunter, the team's General Manager, was concerned about the state of junior hockey in western Canada. Each of the west's four provinces all had their own junior league, and Hunter felt that this put them at a disadvantage when competing nationally against the powerful leagues in Ontario and Quebec. Hunter hoped to form a unified western league to compete.\n\nHunter's hopes became reality in the summer of 1966, when a revolt within the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League caused several of its top clubs, the Estevan Bruins, Regina Pats, Saskatoon Blades, Moose Jaw Canucks and Weyburn Red Wings, to leave the league and join Hunter's Oil Kings in forming a new league. A seventh franchise was also added in Calgary, the Calgary Buffaloes.\n\nThe Oil Kings captured back to back President's Cup titles in 1971 and 1972, however it would prove to be the final titles in the celebrated franchise's history, as the Oil Kings found it difficult to compete with the lure of pro hockey provided by the WHA's Edmonton Oilers. The Oil Kings moved to Portland, Oregon in 1976, to become the Portland Winter Hawks.\n\nThere was a second Edmonton Oil Kings hockey team in the WHL that played only one season. The Flin Flon Bombers moved to Edmonton for the 1978–79 WHL season, but only survived one year and moved on to Great Falls.

{"id": "1963688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963688", "title": "Ontario Public Service Employees Union", "text": "Ontario Public Service Employees Union\n\nThe Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU; ) is a trade union representing public sector employees in the province of Ontario, Canada. OPSEU was established in 1975 as the successor union to the former Civil Service Association of Ontario, which was founded in 1911. In 1979, OPSEU affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress, the National Union of Public and General Employees, and the Ontario Federation of Labour. OPSEU is affiliated to several labour councils across Ontario.\n\nThe current president is Warren \"Smokey\" Thomas, who was first elected to the position in 2007. The labour expertise of President Thomas is recognised by his role as a faculty member in Employment Relations at Queen's University. Eduardo \"Eddy\" Almeida is the union’s First Vice-President/Treasurer.\n\nThe union is structured into local occupational groups, units or locals. Most members of OPSEU work for the Ontario Public Service, municipal governments and services, and the public college system. Additionally, some members work for private companies or organizations that are contracted to provide a public service such as hospitals and medical laboratories. The list of bargaining units includes Colleges of Applied Arts & Technology - Academic (CAAT-A) with about 12,000 members, just under 10% of OPSEU's total membership, Colleges of Applied Arts & Technology - Support (CAAT-S), Hospital Professionals Division Central Provisions (HPD), Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC), Ontario Public Service (OPS). Other members include ambulance, developmental services, boards of education, children's aid societies, community agencies, long-term care, universities, hospital professionals, hospital support, municipalities, child treatment centres, municipal property assessment, mental health, Canadian Blood Services and Diagnostics. \"OPSEU also represents members in many boards, Crown agencies, and tribunals, such as the Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal, the Ontario Pension Board, the Ontario New Democratic Party Caucus, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.\"\n\nIn June, 2016, part-time support staff at all Ontario colleges held a vote on whether to join OPSEU. The College Employer Council blocked the counting of the ballots for more than a year, eventually losing. When the ballots were counted in January, 2018, 84% were in favour, leading to approximately 20,000 part-time support staff joining the union. OPSEU called this \"the largest union organizing drive in Canadian history.\"\n\nIn October, 2017, part-time college faculty held a vote to join the union, but the results are not known because the College Employer Council is attempting to block the counting of the ballots.\n\nIn 1993, Ontario's first NDP government altered the legislation governing Ontario Public Service employees to allow them to strike. In 1996, Ontario Public Service employees struck legally (Correctional Officers struck illegally in 1979) for the first time in their history. The strike was deeply political; OPSEU rallied against the Mike Harris government's proposed job cuts. The tension between the Government and OPSEU culminated on March 18, 1996 in a confrontation between the OPP and OPSEU strikers at Queen's Park in Toronto. Ontario Provincial Police riot control officers were called in to escort members of parliament who were being prevented from entering the legislature. MPPs were pelted with rocks and paper cups when they tried to cross the line. The confrontation escalated when police began to push through the line of protesters and violence erupted. At least half a dozen protesters were injured.\n\nThe second strike between OPSEU and the provincial government lasted 54 days (March 13 to May 5) in 2002. Again, tensions between managers and the union were strong. Although there was no bloody confrontation between the union and the government during this strike, there was a strong division between union members and management.\n\nCollege faculty were on strike from Oct. 16 until November 9, when they were legislated back to work.\n\n8,800 faculty members at Ontario's 22 community colleges went on strike on October 19, 1989. The strike ended on November 14 when OPSEU and the Ontario Council of Regents agreed to binding arbitration after back-to-work legislation was threatened. At the time, the average earnings of a teacher was about $47,000, and salaries ranged from $22,800 to $52,250.\n\nOn March 7, 2006, roughly 9,100 faculty at Ontario's 24 colleges went on strike. Faculty returned to work on March 27 after 18 days on strike. At the time, full-time faculty had \"a starting salary of about $32,000, an average pay of about $75,000 and a 16-year progression to reach top wage levels in their collective agreement, according to the union. The colleges offered a package that would have increased salaries by 12.6 per cent by the end of four years, taking the maximum pay to about $94,000. The union had proposed 12 per cent over three years.\"\n\nOn October 16, 2017, roughly 12,000 full-time faculty, partial load faculty, counsellors and librarians at the province's 24 Colleges went out on strike. The OPSEU collective bargaining team for the teachers was led by Warren Thomas and J.P. Hornick, Coordinator of the School of Labour at George Brown College. Bill 178, the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Labour Dispute Resolution Act, 2017 was successfully passed on Sunday, November 19, 2017, ending the strike and sending the parties to mediation and binding arbitration. Faculty members returned to work on November 20. Students resumed classes on November 21, 2017. The parties agreed to employ William Kaplan as mediator-arbitrator under the legislation. He published his decision on Dec. 20, 2017, and both sides appeared to be pleased with the result. The decision included a 7.75 increase in wages over four years and a one time lump sum payment for full and part-time staff.\n\nOn March 9, 2017, the Canadian newspaper, the Toronto Star published an article stating that OPSEU President Warren \"Smokey\" Thomas was 'accused of asking a community college president to fire a professor … according to allegations in a complaint to the Ontario Labour Relations Board'.

It is also referred to as the Smuggling Protocol. It is one of the three Palermo protocols, the others being the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children and the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition.\n\nThe Smuggling Protocol entered into force on 28 January 2004. As of May 2020, the protocol has been signed by 112 parties and ratified by 149.\n\nThe Protocol is aimed at the protection of rights of migrants and the reduction of the power and influence of organized criminal groups that abuse migrants. It emphasizes the need to provide migrants with humane treatment, and the need for comprehensive international approaches to combating people smuggling, including socio-economic measures that address the root causes of migration.\n\nThe Protocol requires States Parties that have ratified to ensure that migrant smuggling (also called people smuggling) is criminalised in accordance with its terms, and those set out in the Convention on Transnational Organised Crime.\n\nGiven the current political priority around people smuggling, it is perhaps surprising that a concerted international focus on defining and responding to migrant smuggling only occurred in the 1990s. This focus followed sharp rises in irregular migration to the United States, and to Europe in the 1980s and 90s. A focus on those who facilitate irregular migration - rather than migrants themselves - was seen as a critical element of any response. The resulting legal framework was the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (Migrant Smuggling Protocol), that supplements the parent instrument, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.\n\nThe Migrant Smuggling Protocol does not provide a complete or self-contained legal regime but instead exists as part of a \"dense web of rights, obligations and responsibilities drawn not just from the Protocol and Convention but also from the law of the sea, human rights law, and refugee law.\"\n\nUnlike human trafficking, people smuggling is characterized by the consent between customer and smuggler - a contractual agreement that typically terminates upon arrival in the destination location. However, smuggling situations can nonetheless in reality descend into situations that can best be described as extreme human rights abuses, with smuggled migrants subject to threats, abuse, exploitation and torture, and even death at the hands of smugglers (see for example, case studies in Gallagher and David, International Law of Migrant Smuggling, 2014, 9-10).\n\n\nbroken link\n\n"}
{"id": "1963716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963716", "title": "Berestia", "text": "Berestia\n\nBerestia (; ; ), or Land of Berestia is the part of Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Polish ethnic territory, bounded by the Bug River, Pripyat River, Yaselda River, and Narew (Narva) River.\n\nIts main cities were Berestia, Bilsk, Dorohychyn, Kobryn, Kamyanyets and Vizna.\n\nPrinces of Berestia (Brest)\n\nThe city was founded by the Slavs. As a town, Brest – \"Berestye\" in Kievan Rus – was first mentioned in the Primary Chronicle in 1019. It became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, was laid waste by the Mongols in 1241 (see: Mongol invasion of Europe), and was not rebuilt until 1275.\n\nIn the second part of the 12th century Berestia became the center of the small feudal duchy called Land of Berestia which was part of Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. In 1164 the Lithuanian Duke Skirmunt took Berestia but did not own it for a long time. Attempts in 1179 and 1182 by the Polish High Duke (or King) Kazimierz II to join Berestia to Poland were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1213 the Polish High Duke or King, Leszko occupied Berestia but in 1222 Volhynian Duke Vasilka, who was Prince of Brest 1221-31, gained control of all Berestia. In the beginning of the 13th century the troops of the Polish High Duke (or King) Konrad Mazowiecki occupied the city of Brest but the population of Berestia resisted and the king had to return the city to the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. In the middle of the 13th century the Berestia Land was invaded by the Mongols. Little if any historical information exists about the depredation of Berestia by these invaders, but sources report that Brest was not rebuilt until 1275. The Mongols, somewhat weakened by fighting with the Slavonic Duchies and finding little of the wide pasturage needed for the maintenance of the vast horse herds that were an integral part of their military formations, did not move further into Europe. Brest was besieged by enemies many times; more than once the town was put to the torch, but each time it was reconstructed.\nTo defend their territories from invaders the Slavonic dukes built fortification castles and towers. In the 12th century a castle and a fortification to harbor the trade caravans that passed through Berestia were built in the city. Brest served as a customs port where the merchants paid taxes on the goods they carried. In 1276 the Wolyn Duke (or Prince) Wlodzimierz Vasilkovich (Vladimir Vasilkovich) erected a castle with a high stone tower, or keep, in the city. He also ordered the construction of another tower on the Lyasnaya (also: Liasnaja, Lysna, or Leśna) river in the forests of Bialowierza Puszcza, to defend the northern territories of his duchy. The city of Kamienec (or Kamianiec) soon appeared in the primeval forest near this second tower. The tower in Kamienec still stands today as a witness to these events.\n\nTo the North of Berestia, the Lithuanian-Belarusian state known as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was emerging. This state appeared on the territories of Baltic tribes half-assimilated with Slavs. The rulers of Lithuania managed to escape subjugation to the neighboring Russian Kniazes (Princes or Dukes), and thus the Grand Duchy continued growing and getting stronger. Beginning with the end of the 12th century the Lithuanian territories were attacked by Crusaders (specifically, the Teutonic Knights), who wanted to subdue both the Baltic and the Russian territories. To resist the Crusaders' threat, a peace treaty between Russian and Lithuanian dukes was signed in 1219.\n\nFrom 1080 to 1150 the land belonged to the Principality of Turov and Pinsk (Turiv-Pynske) {Turów, Pinsk}, later to the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, and after 1320 to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as part of the Trakai Voivodeship. From 1569 to 1795 it constituted the Podlaskie Voivodeship and Brest Litovsk Voivodeship of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the third partition of the Commonwealth (1795), the territory was annexed to the Russian Empire.\n\n"}
{"id": "1963718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963718", "title": "Atomkraft", "text": "Atomkraft\n\nAtomkraft are an English heavy metal band, who were part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. They formed in 1979 and initially disbanded 1988. Their \"Total Metal\" approach is somewhere between fellow NWOBHM bands such as Motörhead and Venom, punk rock bands such as The Dickies, and early Exodus or Slayer. The band subsequently reformed in 2005.\n\nThe roots of Atomkraft date to mid-1978, when Tony ‘Demolition’ Dolan and Paul Spillett got together with the intention to form a band. Initially, going under the name of Moral Fibre and playing punk rock, they recruited guitarists Ian Legg and Chris Taylor. Ian Legg then left to be replaced by Sean Drew who also subsequently left. However the band continued to operate as a trio.\n\nOn returning from a trip to Bremen, Germany, Taylor presented his band mates with some button badges featuring the environmental slogan 'Atomkraft, Nein Danke!' (Nuclear Power, No Thanks!) They liked the way the word \"Atomkraft\" sounded and so adopted it as the band name, believing it suits the new \"metal\" sound they pursued. In the endeavour for something more metal and less punk they got rid of Taylor. After trying out a couple of guitarists they settled on Steve White, whom Dolan knew from his art class at college. Another member of Dolan's art class, Mark Irvine, joined on bass. With Dolan on rhythm guitar and vocals and Spillett on drums the new line-up played four shows. Irvine's parents disapproved of his heavy metal image and lifestyle and so persuaded him to quit the band. Dolan switched back to bass and the band was able to continue.\n\nIn 1981, the band recorded the four song demo \"Demon\" at Impulse Studios, this being funded by Spillett who was the only one working at the time, and with the help of Keith Nicol. It was their first \"proper\" demo, although, the limitation of time and a two-track recorder gave results that were far from ideal. However, the band soldiered on, gaining experience by continuing to play live shows.\n\nIn early 1983, Atomkraft returned to Impulse Studios to record another demo. Learning from their previous experience they opted to record only two tracks for the \"Total Metal\" demo, featuring the title track and \"Death Valley\". White passed a copy of the demo to Sam Kress, who ran a radio station and \"Whiplash\" magazine. Kress liked the demo and promised to feature the band in his magazine. However, in late 1983, White left the band for personal reasons. Dolan was invited to stay with his sister in Canada to help out with her two children, while she was studying. With Dolan unemployed and the band effectively on hold, he decided to take her up on her offer.\n\nIn 1984, Spillett joined Dolan in Canada. The latter was further inspired when he got a copy of the magazine containing the write-up that Kress had promised. The write-up presented Atomkraft in a positive light and also featured Venom, Raven, Metallica, Anthrax and Megadeth. Spurred on by this, Spillett and Dolan began writing material and returned to England in late 1984 to search for a guitarist. They later fell out over a girl and went their separate ways.\n\nWhile visiting Neat Records to see if anyone could recommend a drummer, Dolan met Cronos of Venom who informed him that Ged Wolf (the brother of Venom's manager) was looking for a band having just left Tysondog. Dolan and Wolf got together and started auditioning for a guitarist. Finally a then 16-year-old guitar player, Rob Mathew, was recommended and this became the new Atomkraft line-up. The band began working on the new material that Dolan had been writing, and went on to record the \"Pour the Metal In\" demo at Neat Records Studio. It featured three tracks, \"Pour the Metal In\", \"Burn in Hell\" and \"Carousel\". The demo was sent to various fanzines and received a good response. Dave Woods of Neat Records heard the demo and offered them a deal, and the band started work on the \"Future Warriors\" album.\n\nRecorded over a couple of weeks and produced by Keith Nichol, \"Future Warriors\" was released in September 1985. Despite getting a poor review in \"Kerrang!\" magazine, other reviews were more positive and they got further requests for interviews. The band also opened for Slayer at The Marquee, where faulty equipment resulted in the band trashing the equipment in frustration after just three numbers. Despite this the band were asked to join the bill of the Venom/Exodus tour.\n\nAfter the end of the Venom/Exodus tour, Atomkraft prepared and recorded a new EP, with the tracks \"Your Mentor\" on the A-side and \"Demolition\", \"Funeral Pyre\" and \"Mode III\" on the B-side. The EP did not get released in this form, as a rift developed in the band as a result of discussions over management. Dolan subsequently left the band. Neat then released the track \"Your Mentor\" as part of the Powertrax promotional cassette, while the vocal tracks on the rest of the \"Your Mentor\" sessions were re-recorded by Ian Davison-Swift from Avenger. D.C. Rage (Darren Cook of Avenger) was brought in as bassist and two new tracks were recorded, with the new four-piece, \"Queen of Death\" and \"Protector\" (although Alan Hunter of Tysondog had originally contributed vocals to \"Protector\"). In October 1986, the re-titled \"Queen Of Death\" EP was released with the title track and \"Protector\" on the A-side, and \"Demolition\", \"Funeral Pyre\" and \"Mode III\" on the B-side. A re-recording of the track \"Future Warriors\", with Davison-Swift on vocals was also licensed for future inclusion in a compilation. With touring commitments lining up for the band, Dolan was invited to rejoin the band as rhythm guitarist, making Atomkraft a five piece outfit for their upcoming shows.\n\nThe new line-up recorded the mini-album \"Conductors of Noize\", which was released in July 1987, and then promoted the record as part of support to Agent Steel and Nuclear Assault. The first date of the tour, at the Hammersmith Odeon featured an expanded line-up of Max Penalty, Atomkraft, Onslaught, Nuclear Assault and Agent Steel, and was promoted as ‘The Longest Day’. Atomkraft’s performance was filmed for the \"Live Conductors\" video as well as being recorded for a live BBC radio broadcast. They also played Dynamo Festival alongside Testament, Destruction and Stryper with the show going out live on Dutch radio.\n\nThe expanded five piece embarked on a 1988 European tour with Nasty Savage and Exumer ultimately resulting in a ‘unique’ gig (for the time) in Katowice, Poland, at Spodek Stadium. This show was recorded for live TV/video. On completion of the tour, the band folded in 1988.\n\nIn 2004, Sanctuary Records (who had previously acquired the Neat Records back catalogue) released an Atomkraft anthology. With renewed interest in the band, Dolan reformed Atomkraft for live dates in 2005 and a possible new album. The 2005 line-up included Payre Hulkoff (from Swedish industrial band Raubtier) on guitar and Steve Mason on drums. However, this line-up did not release any new material. An EP of new material came out in 2011 on the Austrian underground label, W.A.R. Productions. Named \"Cold Sweat\" it contained three unreleased tracks recorded with members of the 2005 line-up and session musicians, plus a cover version of the Thin Lizzy track, \"Cold Sweat\", featuring Australian guitar player Joe Matera on guitar solo. Following the release of \"Cold Sweat\", Dolan recruited a new line-up and did one date in London under the Atomkraft moniker in 2011, performing tracks from the new EP. The 2011 line-up included Kraen Maier and Rich Davenport on guitars, plus Paul Caffrey (from Gama Bomb) on drums. This line-up of Atomkraft (minus Rich Davenport) performed the \"Future Warriors\" LP in its entirety in March 2014 at the second edition of Brofest, a NWOBHM festival based in Newcastle upon Tyne. Former Venom guitarist Jeff Mantas appeared as a guest during the gig.\n\nA new compilation album, called \"Looking Back To The Future\", was released in 2014 by Italian label Minotauro Records. It contained essentially unreleased demos and live tracks from every era of the band's history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The racetrack closed in 1995 and the arena in 2002; the facility was demolished in 2005, and is currently being redeveloped for a variety of uses, including dormitory housing for the University of Nebraska Omaha and the Aksarben Village development.\n\nAk-Sar-Ben is \"Nebraska\" spelled backwards. The Knights originally said they were turning Nebraska around, thus \"Ak-Sar-Ben.\"\n\nAk-Sar-Ben Coliseum was the premiere ice rink and concert arena in Omaha for more than 70 years. Popular acts ranging from Frank Sinatra to Elvis Presley to Nirvana all performed to sold-out crowds. It was also home to the Omaha Knights, a minor league hockey team from 1959 to 1975. The Knights began operations in 1959 in the IHL, and later moved to the now-defunct CHL, with teams affiliated with the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and both the Calgary and Atlanta Flames. The arena hosted the USHL's Omaha Lancers for its final dozen years and the Omaha Racers basketball of the CBA from 1989 to 1997. The Coliseum also hosted world-class boxing, was a major stop on the PBR and attracted many popular comedians.\n\nIn the racetrack's glory days, the Coliseum housed a cinema-sized screen and betting windows to handle the overflow of fans. In the mid-1980s, Ak-Sar-Ben was tenth in the nation in racetrack attendance, with up to 25,000 betting $2 million per day on weekends. Many festivals were also held in the Coliseum annually, including a Greek Festival and River City Roundup booths.\n\nFollowing his death in 1959, the 1935 Triple Crown winner Omaha was buried at the racetrack's Circle of Champions. The thoroughbred spent his final nine years at a farm outside of Nebraska City and made promotional appearances at the Ak-Sar-Ben racetrack during the 1950s.\n\nHorse racing at Ak-Sar-Ben ended in August 1995, just ten years after its record season of 1985. Dog racing began in adjacent Iowa in 1986 and other forms of gambling followed, and attendance rapidly declined at Ak-Sar-Ben. A portion of the property was sold to First Data Resources under the agreement that FDR would donate part of the land to the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO) for its Aksarben Campus to build a new College of Information and Technology.\n\nAfter the remaining buildings and grandstand were torn down in early 2005, a proposal was put forth to create a mixed-use development called Aksarben Village. Construction began in 2006 and the first businesses opened in 2008. Baxter Arena, home to several of UNO's sports teams, opened in October 2015.\n\nFollowing the closure of the racetrack, simulcast facility Horsemen's Park () was opened near Ralston The horse racing industry in Nebraska is now confined to live racing dates rotating from Fonner Park in Grand Island, to the Lincoln Race Course in Lincoln, and finishing at Agricultural Park in Columbus, plus a four-day meet at Horsemen's Park (the latter required to keep their simulcasting license). A fourth track, Atokad in the northeast part of the state, also holds a brief meeting each year.\n\n\n"}

It was planned as a large complex, but was reduced in size to that of a 7-storey office block. It opened in 1933 as the head office and the Hamilton station of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway (TH&B).

There is an additional bypass track which runs between the platforms and another two tracks on the south side, which access Willowbrook Yard.\n\nThis station and Long Branch are the only two stations on the Lakeshore West line which are not fully accessible.\n\nA modernization project began in August 2013 and was completed by 2018. It included the expansion of the platforms to fit 12-car trains, an expanded parking area, a pedestrian tunnel to Manchester Street, and a new station building.\n\nThe Toronto Transit Commission's 76 Royal York South bus route operates along Royal York Road close to the station, linking it to Royal York subway station in the north and the 501 Queen streetcar route to the south.

A Mimico Station was built on the north side of the tracks just south of Mimico's Christ Church (the first church in Etobicoke) on the east side of Church St (Royal York) at the end of Windsor Street. This development meant the name Mimico became more associated with the area where the railway crossed the Mimico Creek to its station on Church St (Royal York) rather than the former Mimico at the Mimico Creek and the early Highway; Dundas. Nevertheless, the 1856 subdivision plan for Mimico largely failed and it was after the more successful 1890 plan for a Town at Mimico the 'old' Mimico Railway Station building, constructed by the Grand Trunk Railway was built in 1916 as well as the Windsor Hotel (Blue Goose Tavern). With the creation of the Government of Ontario's regional train GO service a new station was constructed on the site of the original 1856 Mimico Station, north of the tracks on the east side of Royal York just south of Christ Church. The 1916 Mimico Station deteriorated and was close to demolition when it was saved by community volunteers and moved to a new permanent location in Coronation Park at the northwest corner of Judson St and Royal York Rd in 2007. The building is now being restored with the intention of converting it into a local museum.\n"}

It is the successor to the RoboSapien robot and uses motion technology based on realistic biomechanics that give it fluid and natural movements. It has a multi-function remote control that uses infrared technology to talk to it. Unlike the original RoboSapien, the Roboraptor is capable of autonomous movement, using 3 realistic gaits.\n\nRoboraptor comes with several sensors that allow it to monitor and interact with its environment. It has infrared and stereo sound sensors on its head, and touch sensors on its chin, tail, and in the mouth allowing for more fun and interactive play.\n\nIt has four different modes of behavior or moods: hunting, cautious, playful, and free-roam. In hunting mode, it will react to sharp sounds and progressively focus its attention more intensely on repeated sounds coming from the same direction. In cautious mode, it will react oppositely and move away from sounds it hears. In playful mode, it will react to sounds in a more whimsical fashion but neither approaching nor avoiding them. In free-roam mode, it will explore its own environment, avoiding obstacles and stopping occasionally to listen for loud sounds to investigate. The Roboraptor does not walk well on carpets and cannot be programmed.\n\nWhen one touches one of Roboraptor's touch sensors, its reaction will vary depending on its mood. Touching its face when it is hunting will make it react angrily and most likely attempt to \"attack\" the person touching it. But if it is feeling playful, it will nuzzle the person's hand and then \"attack\", using its jaws.\n\nEarly versions of the Roboraptor could also follow a laser-like target pointed on the ground. This could be used this to lead it around a room under direct control. However, this feature was removed from later units.\n\nThere is also a smaller version of Roboraptor available. However, it does not have a remote control or different modes of behavior. It is not an autonomous robot so much as it is a wind-up toy, though the smaller version does actually run on batteries. It is a smaller, cheaper, less functional Roboraptor. It walks at a single pace and it has a 'trigger' to make its mouth move, but it does not have any other sensors.\n\n"}
{"id": "1963761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963761", "title": "Pot boiler", "text": "Pot boiler\n\nA pot boiler is a heated stone used to heat water.\n\nIn an archaeological / anthropological context, the term refers to a stone used to move heat from a fire to a vessel to raise the temperature of water in the vessel, including for cooking. The stone is heated in a fire or in embers. When hot enough, the stone is transferred into a vessel of water to heat the contents. The vessel may be metal (though this is uncommon, metal normally being tough enough to take direct heat from a fire) or pottery which is not of good enough quality to be directly exposed to the heat of the fire. In a pre-pottery context, the heating can be done by lining a pit with leather, leaves or clay, and then putting in the water followed by pot boilers directly into the vessel.\n\nThe repeated exposure to the heat of the fire followed typically by rapid chilling in water leads to great thermal stress on the stone's fabric due to the thermal expansion and contraction. This typically leads to partial glazing of the stone's surface and a fine network of cracks on the stone's surface (often described as \"crazing\"). Eventually the stone shatters. Individual fragments may be re-used until it becomes infeasible to manipulate the stone into and out of the fire, at which point the fragments are discarded and a new pot boiler (or many new ones) are acquired. Often the broken pot boilers are discarded into middens or domestic waste deposits, which on long-established sites can amount to many tonnes of material.\n\nReuse as building material is not impossible, but the typical small size of the fragments hinders this use.\n\nSurface \"crazing\" is not restricted to pot boilers - hearth stones and the surrounds of fireplaces may also show the same structure. However, since a pot boiler needs to be manipulated into and out of the fire (typically in anthropological observations, using sticks of green wood) at arm's length, they start off weighing up to several kilogrammes, and shrink by fragmentation ; hearth stones and chimney liners are typically larger.\n\n"}

Jesus has come to John the Baptist to be baptized, but John balked at this, saying that he should be the one baptized. In this verse, Jesus explains why it is right that He should be baptized.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:15\n\nThese are the first words spoken by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, which is traditionally placed as the first book of the New Testament, so these are textually the first words spoken by Jesus in the entire Bible. According to general scholarship, the first recorded words of Jesus are actually in Mark 1:15 (as it was considered the first Gospel that was written): \"This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. So repent (), and believe in the gospel.\"\n\nLike the previous verse, this one only occurs in Matthew. Many scholars see this section as an add-on attempting to explain why the messiah is baptized by someone much lower than he is. The phrase \"fulfill all righteousness\" is a problematic one. Righteousness is an important concept in Matthew and it generally means obedience to God. Matthew also often uses the word \"fulfill\", almost always referring to an Old Testament prophecy which Jesus is fulfilling. David Hill notes that the phrase could thus be interpreted as Jesus fulfilling divine rules of which only he is aware. Cullman emphasizes the word \"all\" and argues that Jesus' baptism is to obtain righteousness for all humanity. Jesuit theologian Daniel Harrington links the fulfillment not to the Old Testament but to the discussion of fruits of repentance at .\n\nA second important issue is why Jesus, who is sinless, should go through a ritual that is designed to cleanse all sins. There are two main explanations of this. One is that Jesus by being baptized is setting a good example for the rest of humanity, that while he does not himself need the cleansing he is showing how important it is for others. The second view is that Jesus' being baptized is part of the process of taking on the burden of the sins of all humanity. German theologian Heinrich Meyer lists and evaluates a number of reasons offered for why Jesus came to be baptized by John.\n\nThe Book of Mormon provides an additional perspective on these two issues, explaining that Jesus \"fulfilled all righteousness\" by humbly witnessing that he would obey the Father, thus setting an example for how \"the children of men\" should live.\n\nReformed Presbyterian theologian R.C. Sproul alternatively views Jesus as saying being baptized was necessary for Him to accomplish the Active Obedience of Christ.\n\nSeveral of the Fathers of the Church infer from the words \"it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness\" that John was afterwards baptized by Jesus.\n"}

The Boulevard shows up again in Primm, Nevada, but is currently not connected to the northern sections. There are tentative plans to connect the existing section at Primm to the northern section at Jean.\nLas Vegas Boulevard serves as the Valley's east/west address demarcation boundary line south of the Stratosphere onwards. The road's own north/south street address demarcation boundary is located at its intersection with Fremont Street. Unlike most other cases, where using the more traditional nomenclature of putting the direction before the road name is common practice, The Boulevard is an exception, as it is almost never referred to as \"North Las Vegas Boulevard\" and \"South Las Vegas Boulevard\". The road instead is usually referred to as \"Las Vegas Boulevard North\" (abbreviated LVBN) and \"Las Vegas Boulevard South\" (stylized LVBS), by both local residents and various media outlets.\n\nAt its northern end in Apex, the Boulevard starts in an industrial complex of manufacturing plants and power plants running along the Union Pacific Railroad line. Traveling south, the road meets Nellis Air Force Base on the east side and the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on the west side.\n\nAs the road enters the city of North Las Vegas, it passes through some of the older commercial areas in the region. As the road approaches the city of Las Vegas proper, some of what historical Las Vegas was becomes visible, as some of the older casinos appear along with some of the more famous and long-operating strip clubs.\n\nUpon entering the city limits of Las Vegas, the Boulevard showcases the area's past with a number of museums, including the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park, the Neon Museum, and the Fremont Street Experience and downtown casino sector. On crossing Washington Avenue, the Boulevard is designated as the \"Downtown Las Vegas Boulevard Scenic Byway\" by the state. This designation continues south to Sahara Avenue.\n\nFurther south is a stretch of road that has many of the older motels, bars and wedding chapels that were among the high points of the old Vegas before the era of the megaresorts.\n\nThe Boulevard leaves the city of Las Vegas at Sahara Avenue and assumes its unofficial name the \"Las Vegas Strip\" for the next . This portion of Las Vegas Boulevard actually begins a few blocks to the north at the Stratosphere (the only major Strip hotel/casino actually sited within the Las Vegas city limits) and runs through Winchester and Paradise, with the Strip technically ending at Russell Road. This is the section of the road most people are familiar with; it is home to casino megaresorts with their world-famous lights, huge video signs and other attractions. It is designated as an All-American Road. Just past the end of \"The Strip\", the road passes the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign (located in the median) as it abuts the western edge of the McCarran International Airport property (the sign is often considered the de facto south end of the Strip, even though it is presently some distance from the nearest resort property.\n\n\"South Strip\" is now used to describe the section of Las Vegas Boulevard between Russell Road and Blue Diamond Road. Along this stretch, development thins out, except for newer shopping malls, hotels, resorts, casinos and condominiums (such as South Point Hotel & Casino and The Grandview at Las Vegas) as the Boulevard continues to travel south, just to the east of Interstate 15. \n\nAfter passing the M Resort, the Boulevard enters rural desert areas. It continues to parallel Interstate 15 and eventually arrives at Jean. South of Jean, the road ceases to be a major artery for a stretch of several miles before resuming just north of Primm, where it runs alongside two of the resort's hotels and shopping mall; just short of the Nevada/California state line, the road changes its name to Lotto Store Road and becomes a local road.\n\nRTC Transit Route(s) 113 (and the MAX, before February 2016, when it was decommissioned) serves the road from Downtown Las Vegas north to Nellis Air Force Base, The Deuce serves the Road from Downtown Las Vegas south to Mandalay Bay (except from 12:30 am local time to 9:00 am local time where it continues further south to the South Strip Transfer Terminal (SSTT)). South of Circus Circus, alongside it runs the SDX (Strip & Downtown Express) which runs from 9am to 12:30am as a limited stop express line. Route 117 serves the road south from the SSTT past the Las Vegas Premium Outlet South store, the South Point Casino and Silverado Ranch Blvd.\n\nLas Vegas Boulevard has had several names, including 5th Street (from Sahara to Owens, within the Las Vegas city limits), Main Street (in North Las Vegas), the Arrowhead Highway, Los Angeles Highway, Salt Lake Highway, US 91 (entire segment), US 93 (from Fremont Street north), US 466 (from Jean to Fremont Street, including the Las Vegas Strip) and State Route 6 (entire segment, unsigned).\n\nSouth of the city, Las Vegas Boulevard was commonly known as the Los Angeles Highway. Just north of Jean is the place where the last spike on the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad line was driven.\n\nWith the construction of I-15, Las Vegas Boulevard went from being the main through road to one that only served as a city street for locals and tourists. Its current name, in effect since 1959, reflects its importance to the Valley rather than past names when it served as a main intra-city road.\n\nOn October 16, 2009, the Federal Highway Administration announced the designation of a new National Scenic Byway on the boulevard. The section starting at Sahara Avenue and running north to Washington Avenue was designated the \"City of Las Vegas, Las Vegas Boulevard State Scenic Byway\".\n\n"}

It is a major commuter transfer point, with large parking lots and local bus services. It is the last station in Toronto before the trains enter Durham Region.\n\nThe earliest Port Union Station was situated at Port Union Road, about half a kilometre west of the current location. The Grand Trunk Railway opened the station in 1856 on its Toronto-Montreal mainline, in what was then the small ship building and fishing village of Port Union.\n\nIn the days of the steam locomotive, freight trains needed assistance to climb from lake level over the Scarborough Bluffs. Port Union was the easterly end of this helper service with a siding that ran behind the station for waiting locomotives, and a water tower and fuel tanks to resupply westbound trains. With the advent of diesel-electric power those facilities were no longer required and Canadian National Railway subsequently replaced the station with a utilitarian brick building.\n\nA spur line branched off to service the Johns Manville plant which lay on the west side of Port Union Road on the south side of Lawrence Avenue down to the railway line.\n\nInspection of the CN station found that insufficient space was available there for parking and vehicle access from Port Union Road was poor. A triangle of land could be obtained 500 metres to the east, on the south side of Lawrence Avenue, that would provide enough space for parking and a bus loop with direct access from the street. When construction of the new GO Train facilities commenced, this was the site chosen for the Premier of Ontario John Robarts to ceremonially turn the first sod.\n\nIn 2018, Loblaws signed a deal with Metrolinx to have a PC Express pick-up van at this station for online orders.\nAll TTC buses enter the bus loop, with the exception of westbound 54A and 954 buses.\n\n"}

Plans for the original GO Transit Lakeshore line called for commuter train service not to go beyond Liverpool Road where the CN York Subdivision tracks joined the CN Kingston Subdivision, because this would interfere with freight trains. No practical site could be found, but there was a large field south of the tracks on the east side of Liverpool Road with more than enough space to accommodate a station building, bus terminal and car parking, with convenient access from Bayly Street. Installation of a new crossover before the overpass at Liverpool Road was required to get to an existing industrial track, so that GO Trains standing at the station platform would be off the main line.\n\nWhen the station opened in 1967 it was a key transfer point between train and bus services.\n\nIn 1990 the single platform was supplement by two more platforms and tracks when GO Transit built a dedicated right-of-way on the north side of the Canadian National tracks. This was part of the project to expand Lakeshore East train service to Ajax and Whitby, and finally to a new terminus at the Oshawa Via Rail station in 1995.\n\nPickering has three platforms for trains, 1 and 2 which serve trains to Union and trains to Oshawa. Track 3, separated from the other tracks, is closest to the bus bays and station. Track 3 is the original track before the extension to Oshawa, which serves Express and Local trains to and from Union which terminate in Pickering.\n\nA pedestrian walkway (to eliminate need for passengers to cross CN tracks to travel from the station to the bus terminal) was completed in 2012, and a new multi-level parking structure is being built at the station and will be completed by spring/summer 2014 with an expected capacity of 1500 new parking spaces.

The castle became a Grade I listed building on 10 June 1953.\n\nIt was in the possession of Thomas of Woodstock, a son of King Edward III of England, until his death in 1391, when it reverted to the Crown.\n\nCaldicot is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, not for its castle, but as an agricultural holding of Durand of Gloucester, Sheriff of Gloucestershire. Walter FitzRoger, Durand's nephew, inherited his lands as well as his father's office of Constable of England which remained with the lords of Caldicot. Walter's son Milo was granted the Earldom of Hereford to add to his titles. In the time of Henry I of England the castle was probably a simple motte-and-bailey. \n\nMilo's five sons died childless so his eldest daughter, Margaret, took to her marriage with Humphrey II de Bohun the Earldom of Hereford, the Constableship of England, and Caldicot. Their son Humphrey III de Bohun was the probable builder, in about 1170, of the stone keep and curtain walls of the present-day castle. The Bohun family held the manor and castle of Caldicot for more than two centuries, over eight generations.\n\nIn 1376 the manor, along with 70 others, passed to Thomas of Woodstock, the third son of King Edward III of England, when he married Alianore de Bohun.\n\nOn the death of Edward III the throne passed to his grandson, the nine-year-old Richard II. As the new king's uncle, Thomas played an important role advising him. He was appointed Constable of England. He rarely visited Caldicot, his main estates being at Pleshey in Essex, close to the seat of power.\n\nIn 1381, however, Essex was convulsed by the Peasants' Revolt. This may be why Thomas decided to spend part of that year in Caldicot. During his stay he gave orders for major new work to be done on the castle. A new gatehouse and drawbridge were constructed. At the rear of the castle a dovecote was replaced by a new tower with private chambers, now known as the Woodstock tower. At the foot of the Woodstock tower two carved stones were to be placed, one marked 'Thomas' the other 'Alianore'.\n\nAs time passed relations between Thomas and King Richard grew increasingly strained. In 1391, on the orders of the king, Thomas was kidnapped and murdered. His property was confiscated and passed into the hands of the Crown.\n\nIn 1399 Henry Bolingbroke seized the throne from Richard, and although Mary de Bohun did not live to see her husband crowned Henry IV, her son, born at Monmouth Castle, would be one of the country's great heroes, Henry V, victor of Agincourt.\n\nThe division of the de Bohuns estates was revised after the death of Alianore and Mary de Bohun's mother Joan, who had outlived both of her daughters by some twenty years. Alianore's eldest daughter and heir, Anne, lost Caldicot to Mary's son King Henry V, and so Caldicot became part of the great Duchy of Lancaster. Held by Henry's widow, Katherine of Valois, Caldicot was later granted into the stewardship of the Herbert family for much of the fifteenth century, and then leased in the sixteenth century to their successors the Somersets with their power base at Raglan.\n\nCaldicot Castle was evidently neglected, fell into ruin and became little more than a farmyard. The castle was sold to Charles Lewis of St Pierre in 1857. In 1885 he sold it to Joseph Richard Cobb, who began the restoration of the castle as his family home.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1964, the Cobb family owned the castle. Joseph Cobb's family remained at the castle after his death and it was his son Geoffrey Wheatly Cobb, and in particular his daughter-in-law Anna, who continued the work of restoration. In the early twentieth century, many rooms were decorated with memorabilia from Nelson's first flagship, HMS \"Foudroyant\" which was owned by G. Wheatly Cobb at the end of its life. G. Wheatly Cobb died in 1931 and, after Anna's death in 1943, the castle passed to Joseph's grandson, Geoffrey Cobb who created furnished apartments for renting in three of the towers and also in parts of the gatehouse.\n\nIn 1964, Chepstow Rural District Council bought the castle from the Cobb family for £12,000, at a time when the increasing availability of council housing had supplanted the local need for the castle apartments. The building, including a small museum, was opened to the public in 1965. After 1967, medieval-style banquets were held there.\n\n"}

On occasion other artists and writers have contributed to the series, including Katie Bair, Fred Perry, Robby Bevard, Carlos Castro, and Fabian Doles.\n\n\"NHS\" takes place in a suburban town known as Quagmire, located \"somewhere in the Midwest\". The series originally centered on the misadventures of Jeremy Feeple, a 16-year-old boy attending Quagmire High School; an alien princess named Asrial from a planet called Salusia; and a young female ninja named Ichi-kun Ichihonei, from Japan. As the series progressed, more backstory was given to the main characters, and a large cast was created. Most of the cast are manga archetypes of varying degrees. \n\n\"NHS\" started out as a limited series that mainly parodied famous anime and manga conventions. (Rumiko Takahashi's \"Urusei Yatsura\" appears to be the main influence, although the title \"\"Ninja High School\"\" was commonly used in the 1980s to refer to Fujihiko Hosono's series \"Sasuga no Sarutobi\", which was actually about a high school for ninja students.) Later story arcs became more serious, delving into murder, drugs, and other more mature subjects. \n\nAfter its initial four-issue run, the comic was popular enough to become a full series, currently totaling over 160 issues (as well as two limited series, \"Ninja High School V2\" and \"Quagmire USA\" and the color limited series \"The Prom Formula\"). There were also two-issue furry parodies, \"Furry Ninja High School\" and \"Furry Ninja High School Strikes Back\". Fan-contributed editions of the series include the \"Ninja High School Yearbook\" and \"Ninja High School Swimsuit Edition\".\n\nWhile not reaching great heights in critical or financial success, \"Ninja High School\" is one of few successful, long running manga-styled comics produced in America. It has contributed greatly to their continuing saturation of the American comics market.\n\nThe first \"Ninja High School\" limited series was published by Dunn's own Antarctic Press from 1987 to 1988. Originally slated for three issues, it continued as an ongoing title. With issue #5, the title was picked up by Eternity Comics, running an additional 35 issues until 1993. (Malibu also gathered the first three issues of the Antarctic Press limited series into a \"graphic novel,\" in preparation for the ongoing series.)\n\nDuring the period Eternity was publishing the title, the company published several \"NHS\" limited series and spin-offs, including a two-issue intercompany crossover with Speed Racer in 1993. When Eternity shut down, Antarctic Press took over publication of \"NHS\" starting with an issue #0 in May 1994. Resuming the numbering with issue #40, Antarctic published 137 issues, ending with issue #175 in August 2009. Story continuity was \"reset\" three times, between issues #57 and #58, issues #74 and #75, and issues #129 and #130.\n\nDuring this period, \"NHS\" crossed over with its fellow Antarctic Press title, \"Gold Digger\"; Antarctic has since published many associated one-shots and limited series.\n\nIssue #74 (publication date April 2000) of the original series completed the Jeremy storylines, and in 1999–2000, Antarctic published a twelve-issue \"NHS\" Volume 2, focusing on Jeremy's younger brother, Ricky. Set four years after \"Ninja High School\" #74; Volume 2 reset continuity so that \"Ninja High School\" #1-74 took place in 1989, not 1986. NHS Volume 2, therefore (as well as all issues of NHS after issue #75+) took place in the 1990s.\n\nFrom issue #101 to #126, the comic was written and drawn by Katie Bair (with assists from Robby Bevard), had a title change (shortened) to just \"NHS\", returned to black and white, and the setting changes to Hawaii. The only major character who carried over from the previous cast was Yumei Katana. This run was later collected into individual volumes under the new title, \"Ninja High School: Hawaii\".\n\nFrom #127 to #129, the comic was cooperatively developed by Fred Perry and Ben Dunn to transition from the Hawaii storyline back to the Quagmire location. The focus returned to the Volume 2 cast.\n\nIn #130, Ricky Feeple returns to the spotlight, in what, after the events of the second \"Quagmire US\" miniseries, may or may not be an alternate timeline. From here the version was dubbed \"Shidoshi\" by Antarctic Press to separate it from the original series. The \"Shidoshi\" series ran eight issues, and a new version of \"NHS\" was planned focusing on a new batch of characters.\n\nThe story centers on Jeremy Feeple, an ordinary student at Quagmire High, living an ordinary life. Shortly into the story, a beautiful female ninja named Itchy Koo (real name Ichikun Ichinohei) and an alien princess named Asrial appear. The earlier stories focus on the girls' comedic attempts to marry this seemingly plain, ordinary high school boy.\n\nThe series plot started rather simply: Princess Asrial was sent to Earth to find Jeremy Feeple and marry him, an act that was described as required to ensure that their enemies do not lay claim to the planet. Since Earth was a non-aligned world, anyone could claim it, and the Salusians were desperate to keep it from being used against them. Ichi went to America to marry Jeremy as well, although her reasons for the trip were different, in order to become leader of her clan, her grandfather informed her that she had to marry the boy, the reason behind this is that Jeremy's mother was raised by this grandfather, and they wanted to be blood related.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after landing, Asrial, Ichi, and Jeremy Feeple get caught up in a whirlwind of comic mischief, fighting, and plots by local villains to take over the planet. The comic often features parody versions of other comics or television shows, usually Japanese, but occasionally European or American, such as \"Kamen Rider\", \"Power Rangers\", \"Ultraman\", \"Harry Potter\", \"Superman\", \"The Powerpuff Girls\", \"Terminator\", \"Robocop\", \"Ninja Gaiden\", \"Transformers\", \"Fist of the North Star\", and the \"Gundam\" series.\n\nLater the series does a time skip and focus on Jeremy's little brother, Ricky Feeple (who was mostly a minor character in the first series), as he enters high school himself, gaining new friends and soon coming into conflict with a rival ninja clan known as Shidoshi who set their sights on destroying him. While the comic still retained its comedic tones, it also ventured into darker territory and has a bit more drama thrown in than the original \"NHS\".\n\n\n\nAt one point the rights to the comic book series were optioned by Perfect Circle Productions with the intention of it being developed into a feature film. The comic book was also adapted into a role-playing game by Battlefield Press.\n\n"}

This article details the major Canadian allocations changes under NARBA.\n\nThe principal reason for Canada in entering the NARBA negotiations was to gain more clear-channel allocations for Canadian stations, particularly for the CBC, which at that time was both Canada's public broadcaster and also its broadcasting regulator. Up to that point, these allocations had been dominated by commercial stations from the United States. Canada had only six clear-channel frequencies: 540, 690, 730, 840, 910, and 1050, of which 540, 730, and 910 were shared with Mexico, and 1050 was shared with the United States.\n\nThe result of the treaty for Canada was to add new clear-channel allocations at 740, 990, and 1010; with the expansion of the AM band to 1605 kHz, Canada would later add 1580.\n\nMost stations throughout North America were minimally affected by the allocations changes. Their channels simply moved up (or in a few cases down) the dial to a new frequency which was shared (or not) with the same stations as were there before. Major Canadian cities, however, saw more changes, as the creation of the three new clear channels invited a reshuffle of channels among the existing broadcasters.

Zobrist hashing is named for its inventor, Albert Lindsey Zobrist. It has also been applied as a method for recognizing substitutional alloy configurations in simulations of crystalline materials.\n\nZobrist hashing starts by randomly generating bitstrings for each possible element of a board game, i.e. for each combination of a piece and a position (in the game of chess, that's 12 pieces × 64 board positions, or 16 x 64 if a king that may still castle and a pawn that may capture \"en passant\" are treated separately for both colors). Now any board configuration can be broken up into independent piece/position components, which are mapped to the random bitstrings generated earlier. The final Zobrist hash is computed by combining those bitstrings using bitwise XOR. Example pseudocode for the game of chess:\n\nIf the bitstrings are long enough, different board positions will almost certainly hash to different values; however longer bitstrings require proportionally more computer resources to manipulate. The most commonly used bitstring (key) length is 64 bits. Many game engines store only the hash values in the transposition table, omitting the position information itself entirely to reduce memory usage, and assuming that hash collisions will not occur, or will not greatly influence the results of the table if they do.\n\nZobrist hashing is the first known instance of tabulation hashing. The result is a 3-wise independent hash family. In particular, it is strongly universal.\n\nAs an example, in chess, each of the 64 squares can at any time be empty, or contain one of the 6 game pieces, which are either black or white. That is, each square can be in one of 1 + 6 x 2 = 13 possible states at any time. Thus one needs to generate at most 13 x 64 = 832 random bitstrings. Given a position, one obtains its Zobrist hash by finding out which pieces are on which squares, and combining the relevant bitstrings together.\n\nRather than computing the hash for the entire board every time, as the pseudocode above does, the hash value of a board can be updated simply by XORing out the bitstring(s) for positions that have changed, and XORing in the bitstrings for the new positions. For instance, if a pawn on a chessboard square is replaced by a rook from another square, the resulting position would be produced by XORing the existing hash with the bitstrings for:\n\nThis makes Zobrist hashing very efficient for traversing a game tree.\n\nIn computer Go, this technique is also used for superko detection.\n\nThe same method has been used to recognize substitutional alloy configurations during Monte Carlo simulations in order to prevent wasting computational effort on states that have already been calculated.\n\n"}

While growing up he also played bandy in Lidköpings AIK.\n\nJärryd turned professional in 1980. He won his first tour doubles title in 1981 in Linz, Austria. One year later he captured his first top-level singles title, also at Linz. In 1983, Järryd won his first Grand Slam doubles title at the French Open, partnering his fellow Swede Hans Simonsson. Järryd had a strong year in 1984, winning two singles and five doubles titles. He also finished runner-up in the men's doubles at the US Open that year, partnering Stefan Edberg.\n\n1985 saw Järryd's career-best Grand Slam singles performance, when he beat Claudio Panatta, Scott Davis, Vincent Van Patten, Danie Visser and Heinz Günthardt to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon before being knocked-out in four sets by Boris Becker.

In the US the upper limit for the value of an investment club's worth is $25m . There is no lower limit. Investment clubs provide members a means to learn about markets, while meeting and working with people who have similar interests.\n\nAlthough people have been investing in groups for thousands of years, the world's first investment club was allegedly established in Texas in 1898 back in the days of the Wild West when few investments could be considered safe. Investment clubs were seen as an ideal way of spreading the risk – away from just cattle.\n\nWhile the first investment club on record dates back to the 1800s in Western America, Various online communities devoted to this type of investing have recently emerged and have contributed to the personal investing boom in the United States. One of the reasons that people come together in investment clubs is to learn how to invest. In Britain investment clubs took off in the 1950s, but the rate of formation fell at the time of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIndustry observers recommend prospective members adhere to these guidelines:\n\n\nThis form of investment club usually meets to develop interest in investing and the intricacies of investing for minors, usually high school students. They typically are led by an adult who has vast experience in professional investing.\n\nThese clubs are groups of people that pool their money to purchase stocks, stock options, mutual funds or bonds. Many clubs are educational in nature with objectives in line with learning how to make smart long-term investments. The National Association of Investors Corporation is a non-profit organization of many investment clubs with this purpose. These clubs may decide to buy or sell investments typically based on a majority votes.\n\nClub objectives do vary and in the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commission may require that a club be registered depending on the intent of investment. The SEC distinguishes between clubs on the basis of several laws including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which are concerned with whether the club issues membership interests that are effectively securities.\n\nClub officers and members are not normally required to hold a securities license as long as they refrain from soliciting compensation in exchange for financial advice or soliciting the sale of stock, mutual funds or bonds in third party companies. One allowed exception is that a CEO / President or CFO of a C Corporation is allowed to solicit stock or bonds in their corporation as long as they provide a private placement memorandum that complies with the law to their new shareholders. One additional requirement is that non-accredited investors must be Directors of the C Corporation in addition to being shareholders.\n\nClubs of this type are most commonly publicized as a real estate investment group or company, rather than a club. The legal distinction according to the SEC is having 100 members or less. Whereas, a real estate investment group would normally have more than 100 investors. These clubs normally buy real estate or notes (loans originated by a licensed third party) to benefit from: cash flow, appreciation of assets, instant equity, tax benefits from deductions or qualified dividends, group buying power, monthly or daily compounding, higher liquidity and diversification of risk. Real estate transactions are limited to 35 participants to meet the legal requirements of many states for being closely held, and can be legally organized as a sole proprietorship transferring assets to a group living trust, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, general partnership or C corporation.\n\nThese clubs are often called incubators and are formed to purchase businesses that generate cash flow and equity. Investment types range from a group of people buying lower risk franchises with at least two years of significant revenues and positive cash flow like major fast food franchises, gas stations and hotels to higher risk businesses without an income history like start-ups, inventions, or product patenting and prototype development.\n\nHybrid clubs are a combination of two or more of the above types of investment clubs. Typically, real estate investment clubs are lower in risk and provide higher returns of 21% to 70% than stock, mutual fund or bond investment clubs due to the ongoing need for housing and population growth. Business investment clubs have about equal risk when compared to stock, mutual fund or bond investment clubs. However, business investment clubs have several additional benefits which include significantly higher returns and lower operating expenses measured by the net profit per year divided by the amount of cash necessary to purchase the business. Additionally, you can also hire yourself or family members to work in the business as employees.\n\nIn order to operate an investment club, business must be conducted in a somewhat orderly fashion. The level of formality will vary based on the club type. A typical club will have informal channels of communication via mailing lists, Twitter accounts or message boards. In addition to the informal channels of communication, an investment club must set up formal channels of communication to conduct business. Typically, this is done with monthly meetings. A typical meeting agenda will include all the normal activity you would expect in an organization with elected officials. A typical meeting agenda: \n\n\nInvestment clubs are normally unincorporated associations. Members’ contributions are converted into ‘units’ whose value rises and falls in line with the value of the underlying investments. The clubs are not taxed corporately, and members should account individually for their share of profits and capital gains.\n\nInvestment clubs are generally formed as general partnerships, but could also be formed as limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, corporations, or sole proprietorship that transfer real estate assets to a group living trust (similar to a family trust). While an investment club could incorporate, the double tax treatment on corporate distributions makes the corporate structure less desirable than a partnership except in the case when a C Corporation pays out qualified dividends after deducting allowable expenses. Typically, a general partnership does not generate any tax liability on its own; instead, any tax liability is passed through to members each year. However, income taxes are generally much higher than taxes on qualified dividends.\n\nIn order to understand the legal structure that an investment club should choose, the club should first understand its club type. Each of the different club types will have different legal requirements as well as different reporting requirements. Typically, the SEC only requires reporting for investment groups with over 100 members, which is reclassified as an investment group, not an investment club. Publicly held offerings like a Real Estate Investment Trust as known as a REIT also have additional reporting requirements.\n\nInvestment club accounting software can facilitate the management of a club's books and the preparation of tax filings.\n\nIn the United States Investment club partnerships may have to file Form 1065 and Schedule K-1s with the IRS each year, and with States that require partnership filings. \n\nIn the United Kingdom investment clubs and their members are required to submit form 185(new) to HMRC each year. \n\n\nTop 5 way to Earn Online Money from Home\n\n"}

Policy approaches to legal informatics issues vary throughout the world. For example, European countries tend to require destruction or anonymization of data so that it cannot be used for discovery.\n\nThe widespread introduction of cloud computing provides several benefits in delivering legal services. Legal service providers can use the Software as a Service model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.\n\nSoftware as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for attorney-client privilege. The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be legally privileged.\n\nArtificial intelligence is employed in online dispute resolution platforms that use optimization algorithms and blind-bidding. Artificial intelligence is also frequently employed in modeling the legal ontology, \"an explicit, formal, and general specification of a conceptualization of properties of and relations between objects in a given domain\".\n\nArtificial intelligence and law (AI and law) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) mainly concerned with applications of AI to legal informatics problems and original research on those problems. It is also concerned to contribute in the other direction: to export tools and techniques developed in the context of legal problems to AI in general. For example, theories of legal decision making, especially models of argumentation, have contributed to knowledge representation and reasoning; models of social organization based on norms have contributed to multi-agent systems; reasoning with legal cases has contributed to case-based reasoning; and the need to store and retrieve large amounts of textual data has resulted in contributions to conceptual information retrieval and intelligent databases.\n\nAlthough Loevinger, Allen and Mehl anticipated several of the ideas that would become important in AI and Law, the first serious proposal for applying AI techniques to law is usually taken to be Buchanan and Headrick. Early work from this period includes Thorne McCarty's influential TAXMAN project in the US and Ronald Stamper's LEGOL project in the UK. Landmarks in the early 1980s include Carole Hafner's work on conceptual retrieval, Anne Gardner's work on contract law, Rissland's work on legal hypotheticals and the work at Imperial College London on the representation of legislation by means of executable logic programs.\n\nEarly meetings of scholars included a one-off meeting at Swansea, the series of conferences organized by IDG in Florence and the workshops organised by Charles Walter at the University of Houston in 1984 and 1985. In 1987 a biennial conference, the International Conference on AI and Law (ICAIL), was instituted. This conference began to be seen as the main venue for publishing and the developing ideas within AI and Law, and it led to the foundation of the International Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law (IAAIL), to organize and convene subsequent ICAILs. This, in turn, led to the foundation of the Artificial Intelligence and Law Journal, first published in 1992. In Europe, the annual JURIX conferences (organised by the Jurix Foundation for Legal Knowledge Based Systems), began in 1988. Initially intended to bring together the Dutch-speaking (i.e. Dutch and Flemish) researchers, JURIX quickly developed into an international, primarily European, conference and since 2002 has regularly been held outside the Dutch speaking countries. Since 2007 the JURISIN workshops have been held in Japan under the auspices of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.\n\nToday, AI and law embrace a wide range of topics, including:\n\nFormal models of legal texts and legal reasoning have been used in AI and Law to clarify issues, to give a more precise understanding and to provide a basis for implementations. A variety of formalisms have been used, including propositional and predicate calculi; deontic, temporal and non-monotonic logics; and state transition diagrams. Prakken and Sartor give a detailed and authoritative review of the use of logic and argumentation in AI and Law, together with a comprehensive set of references.\n\nAn important role of formal models is to remove ambiguity. In fact, legislation abounds with ambiguity: Because it is written in natural language there are no brackets and so the scope of connectives such as \"and\" and \"or\" can be unclear. \"Unless\" is also capable of several interpretations, and legal draftsman never write \"if and only if\", although this is often what they intend by \"if\". In perhaps the earliest use of logic to model law in AI and Law, Layman Allen advocated the use of propositional logic to resolve such syntactic ambiguities in a series of papers.\n\nIn the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s a significant strand of work on AI and Law involved the production of executable models of legislation, originating with Thorne McCarty's TAXMAN and Ronald Stamper's LEGOL . TAXMAN was used to model the majority and minority arguments in a US Tax law case (Eisner v Macomber), and was implemented in the micro-PLANNER programming language. LEGOL was used to provide a formal model of the rules and regulations that govern an organization, and was implemented in a condition-action rule language of the kind used for expert systems.\n\nThe TAXMAN and LEGOL languages were executable, rule-based languages, which did not have an explicit logical interpretation. However, the formalisation of a large portion of the British Nationality Act by Sergot et al. showed that the natural language of legal documents bears a close resemblance to the Horn clause subset of first order predicate calculus. Moreover, it identified the need to extend the use of Horn clauses by including negative conditions, to represent rules and exceptions. The resulting extended Horn clauses are executable as logic programs.\n\nLater work on larger applications, such as that on Supplementary Benefits, showed that logic programs need further extensions, to deal with such complications as multiple cross references, counterfactuals, deeming provisions, amendments, and highly technical concepts (such as contribution conditions). The use of hierarchical representations was suggested to address the problem of cross reference; and so-called isomorphic representations were suggested to address the problems of verification and frequent amendment. As the 1990s developed this strand of work became partially absorbed into the development of formalisations of domain conceptualisations, (so-called ontologies), which became popular in AI following the work of Gruber. Early examples in AI and Law include Valente's functional ontology and the frame based ontologies of Visser and van Kralingen. Legal ontologies have since become the subject of regular workshops at AI and Law conferences and there are many examples ranging from generic top-level and core ontologies to very specific models of particular pieces of legislation.\n\nSince law comprises sets of norms, it is unsurprising that deontic logics have been tried as the formal basis for models of legislation. These, however, have not been widely adopted as the basis for expert systems, perhaps because expert systems are supposed to enforce the norms, whereas deontic logic becomes of real interest only when we need to consider violations of the norms. In law directed obligations, whereby an obligation is owed to another named individual are of particular interest, since violations of such obligations are often the basis of legal proceedings. There is also some interesting work combining deontic and action logics to explore normative positions.\n\nIn the context of multi-agent systems, norms have been modelled using state transition diagrams. Often, especially in the context of electronic institutions, the norms so described are regimented (i.e., cannot be violated), but in other systems violations are also handled, giving a more faithful reflection of real norms. For a good example of this approach see Modgil et al.\n\nLaw often concerns issues about time, both relating to the content, such as time periods and deadlines, and those relating to the law itself, such as commencement. Some attempts have been made to model these temporal logics using both computational formalisms such as the Event Calculus and temporal logics such as defeasible temporal logic.\n\nIn any consideration of the use of logic to model law it needs to be borne in mind that law is inherently non-monotonic, as is shown by the rights of appeal enshrined in all legal systems, and the way in which interpretations of the law change over time. Moreover, in the drafting of law exceptions abound, and, in the application of law, precedents are overturned as well as followed. In logic programming approaches, negation as failure is often used to handle non-monotonicity, but specific non-monotonic logics such as defeasible logic have also been used. Following the development of abstract argumentation, however, these concerns are increasingly being addressed through argumentation in monotonic logic rather than through the use of non-monotonic logics.\n\nBoth academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the Supreme Court forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court. The model predicted 75% of cases correctly compared to experts who only predicted 59.1% of cases.\nAnother example of an academic quantitative legal prediction models is a 2012 model that predicted the result of Federal Securities class action lawsuits.\nSome academics and legal technology startups are attempting to create algorithmic models to predict case outcomes. Part of that effort involves improved case assessment for litigation funding.\n\nIn order to better evaluate the quality of case outcome prediction systems, a proposal has been made to create a standardised dataset that would allow comparisons between systems.\n\nWithin the practice issues conceptual area, progress continues to be made on both litigation and transaction focused technologies. In particular, technology including predictive coding has the potential to effect substantial efficiency gains in law practice. Though predictive coding has largely been applied in the litigation space, it is beginning to make inroads in transaction practice, where it is being used to improve document review in mergers and acquisitions. Other advances, including XML coding in transaction contracts, and increasingly advanced document preparation systems demonstrate the importance of legal informatics in the transactional law space.\n\nCurrent applications of AI in the legal field utilize machines to review documents, particularly when a high level of completeness and confidence in the quality of document analysis is depended upon, such as in instances of litigation and where due diligence play a role. . Predictive coding leverages small samples to cross-reference similar items, weed out less relevant documents so attorneys can focus on the truly important key documents, produces statistically validated results, equal to or surpassing the accuracy and, prominently, the rate of human review. .\n\nAdvances in technology and legal informatics have led to new models for the delivery of legal services. Legal services have traditionally been a \"bespoke\" product created by a professional attorney on an individual basis for each client. However, to work more efficiently, parts of these services will move sequentially from (1) bespoke to (2) standardized, (3) systematized, (4) packaged, and (5) commoditized. Moving from one stage to the next will require embracing different technologies and knowledge systems.\n\nThe spread of the Internet and development of legal technology and informatics are extending legal services to individuals and small-medium companies.\n\nCorporate legal departments may use legal informatics for such purposes as to manage patent portfolios, and for preparation, customization and management of documents.\n\n"}

An ardent abolitionist, he was noted for encouraging thousands of free black men to join the Union army.\n\nBirney was a son of prominent Southern abolitionist leader James G. Birney and the older brother of Civil War general David B. Birney. Another brother, James M. Birney, served as Lieutenant Governor of Michigan in 1860. A cousin, Humphrey Marshall, was a U.S. Congressman and a general in the Confederate States Army.\n\nWilliam Birney was born May 28, 1819 on his father's plantation near Huntsville, Alabama. He grew up there and in Danville, Kentucky. Birney was educated at Centre College and Yale University and he practiced law in Cincinnati, Ohio. He then lived for five years in Europe, primarily on the Continent and in England. For two years, he was a professor of English literature at the college in Bourges. He took an active part in the revolutionary movement in France in 1848. He later wrote numerous articles for English and American newspapers. Returning to the United States in 1853, Birney established a newspaper, the \"Daily Register\", in Philadelphia.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Birney entered the Union Army on May 22, 1861 as a captain in the 1st New Jersey Infantry Regiment. He first saw combat in the First Battle of Bull Run. Promoted to major of the 4th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, he participated in the battles of Second Bull Run, Chantilly, Fredericksburg, and, as a colonel, the Chancellorsville. In 1863–64, he was appointed as one of three superintendents in charge of enlisting colored troops into the Union army, and in that capacity organized seven regiments. He was named Colonel of the 22nd U.S. Colored Troops. On June 9, 1863, he was commissioned as a brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from May 22, 1863, and assigned to Maryland to recruit more black troops. In 1864, he marched his regiments to fight in South Carolina as a part of the Department of the South. They fared poorly, but did much better work in campaigns in Florida, including the Battle of Olustee.\nBirney's brigade was transferred to Virginia and joined other black regiments to form the Third Division of the X Corps under the command of Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler. They suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, but were instrumental in several fights along the defenses of Richmond. In December 1864, the X Corps black regiments were combined with those of the XVIII Corps in the new all-black XXV Corps under Maj. Gen. Godfrey Weitzel. Birney's regiments became the 2nd Division of the XXV Corps, and participated in the last assaults during the Siege of Petersburg in early 1865. He then led his division in the pursuit of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia during the Appomattox Campaign. Birney was mustered out of the volunteer army on August 24, 1865.\n\nOn July 20, 1866, President of the United States Andrew Johnson nominated Birney for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865 and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 26, 1866.\n\nBirney resided in Florida for several years after the war before moving north in 1874 to establish a law practice in Washington, D.C.. He served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and as a school board trustee until 1886. He wrote profusely on the subjects of religion and history and authored a biography of his father, \"James G. Birney and His Times; the Genesis of the Republican Party\", in 1890.\n\nBirney died at his home in Forest Glen, Maryland on August 14, 1907, and was buried in the Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown (Washington, D.C.).\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1929 through a merger arranged by Weirton Steel with some properties of the Great Lakes Steel Corporation and M.A. Hanna Company with headquarters in Pittsburgh. Despite a difficult market in Depression-setting 1930, the company reported USD 8.4 million in profits. Again, in 1931 the company was profitable unlike many other competitors. The company could attribute its success primarily to sales to the automobile industry. Large steel producing operations were located near Detroit, providing the company with low shipping costs. Throughout the Great Depression, National Steel obtained profitability every year.\n\nThe post-World War II years brought about record profits for the company as steel was in high demand. The company continued to post healthy profits in the 1970s, although the latter half of the decade saw some sharp and turbulent profit slumps. The increasing consumption of imported steel was often an attributed problem. It acquired United Financial, a savings and loan, in 1979, adding another sundry item for its portfolio.\n\nBeginning in 1980, the company reported a serious loss of demand and with it profits in its core steel business. A roller coaster earnings surge the next year crashed down the year after that due to a further increase in imports and low demand. In 1983, shareholders agreed to create National Intergroup, a holding company, and merge the steel business as one many units into it. The corporate reorganization was a further step to an already initiated arrangement that started in 1982, which broke the company into six independently managed units. The move was intended to better administer the company which had become diversified away from steel into aluminum and financial services. That same year, the workers of the Weirton mill purchased their operation from National Steel, forming an independent employee-owned corporation.\n\nIn February 1984, Nippon Kokan K.K., a major Japanese steel producer, acquired 50% of National Steel from National Intergroup for US$ 292 million. Later in 1990, the Japanese firm would claim another 20% share from National Intergroup, which was eager to sell the steel business. The company stumbled through troubled years as it shed thousands of workers and faced bankruptcy in 1991.\n\nNational Steel spun-off its computer data subsidiary Genix which spun-off the current-day Corporate Election Services, a market leader in proxy statement and proxy fight services based in suburban Pittsburgh.\n\nThe company announced in 1991 that it would re-locate its longtime Pittsburgh headquarters to the South Bend, Indiana area.\n\nIn 1994, the company caused a stir in the industry when it terminated nearly all of its vice presidents, President and CFO, and replaced them by hiring nearly the complete executive staff of the U.S. Steel Gary Works, including V. John Goodwin who was named the new President of National Steel. U.S. Steel was incensed and filed a lawsuit which the two companies settled out-of-court in 1995. However these drastic leadership changes were short-lived, as Goodwin resigned in 1996, the result of a bitter dispute with the Japanese ownership and by 1998 nearly all of the U.S. expatriates had departed from National.\n\nThe darkest days of National's management history occurred in 2000, when an internal auditor, tipped off by an informer, discovered that longtime executive James Squires was receiving millions of dollars in kickbacks from scrap suppliers. This was an especially painful event for the company because Squires had been hailed as a \"self-made man\" who had advanced from a mill laborer to a Senior Vice President over the course of his 42-year career, and had professed to be the pinnacle of financial stewardship. Nevertheless, in August 2001, Squires was convicted in Federal Court of receiving kickbacks, and in 2002 was sentenced to two years imprisonment. Later he was forced to pay National approximately $3,000,000 in a civil lawsuit. In his allocution at sentencing, Squires noted, apologetically, that he had taken the improper payments because the company was promoting \"Harvard MBA's\" more rapidly than it was promoting him. The truth of the matter, however, was that Squires was one of the company's most senior executives, and that National Steel did not have any Harvard MBA's within its ranks, let alone any who were promoted ahead of Squires.\n\nThe company then lumbered along for the next few years, hampered by doddering executive management. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, the result of a deep depression in the industry at the time combined with the laggard leadership.\n\nThe company would never again enjoy extended periods of profit and finally in March 2002, it filed for bankruptcy with only $2.3 billion in assets for $2.6 billion in debt. After a bidding war between AK Steel and U.S. Steel, in May 2003 the remains of National Steel were sold to U.S. Steel for $850 million and the assumption of $200 million in debt. US Steel continues to operate National's Keewatin mining operation and pellet plant under the new name of Keewatin Taconite or \"Keetac\".\n\n"}

He and his brother, Charles Horace Mayo, both joined their father's private medical practice in Rochester, Minnesota, US, after graduating from medical school in the 1880s. In 1919, that practice became the not-for-profit Mayo Clinic.\n\nAugustus Stinchfield was also asked to join the medical practice in 1892 by William Worrall Mayo. Once Stinchfield was hired, W. W. Mayo retired at age 73. Others who were invited to be part of the enterprise were C. Graham, E. Starr Judd, Henry Stanley Plummer, Melvin Millet and Donald Balfour.\n\nWill Mayo was born to William Worrall Mayo and his wife Louise in Le Sueur, Minnesota in his parents' home. As a child, William and his brother Charles frequently accompanied their father as he went about his business as a pioneer physician. They began by helping out with very menial tasks, and were gradually given more responsibility. Eventually, the boys were administering anesthesia and tying off blood vessels.\n\nOne night at the age of 16, Will accompanied his father to an abandoned hotel where one of the elder Mayo's patients worked as the caretaker. The patient had just died and Mayo was going to perform an autopsy. Will stood by and watched the procedure and after about an hour, it was time to go to another patient's home. Mayo asked his son to stay behind and clean up. \"Sew up the incisions and then tuck the sheet around the corpse. When you finish, go right home.\" Will nervously began to stitch up the incisions on the body and recounted the incident many years later saying, \"I'm about as proud of the fact that I walked out of there, instead of ran, as of anything else I ever made myself do\".\n\nMayo earned his medical degree at the University of Michigan Medical School in 1883, where he became a founder of Nu Sigma Nu Medical Fraternity. Afterwards he returned to Rochester to practice medicine alongside his father and his brother Charles.\n\nOn August 21, 1883, a tornado struck Rochester, killing 29 people and seriously injuring over 55 others. One-third of the town was destroyed, but young Will and his family escaped serious harm. The relief efforts began immediately with a temporary hospital being established at the town's dance hall. The Mayo brothers were extensively involved in treating the injured who were brought there for help. Mother Alfred Moes and the Sisters of Saint Francis were called in to act as nurses (despite the fact they were trained as teachers and had little if any medical experience).\n\nAfter the crisis had subsided, Mother Alfred Moes approached William Worrall Mayo about establishing a hospital in Rochester. On September 30, 1889, Saint Mary's Hospital opened. W.W. Mayo, 70 years old, became the consulting physician and surgeon at the hospital, and his two sons began seeing patients and performing surgery with the assistance of the Sisters of Saint Francis.\n\nWilliam J. Mayo married Hattie Marie Damon (1864-1952) in 1884. They had 5 children, two of whom survived infancy. Carrie born in 1887 and Pheobe in 1897 both married physicians at the Mayo clinic.\n\nHe died in July 1939 of gastric carcinoma (stomach cancer) in Rochester, Minnesota. That type of tumor had been a major focus of his surgical practice. Mayo is buried with his family members near his parents and brother at Oakwood Cemetery in Rochester.\n\nThe United States Postal Service printed a stamp depicting him and his brother, Charles Horace Mayo, on September 11, 1964.\n\nBoth William J. Mayo and his brother Charles H. Mayo were prominent Freemasons of the Grand Lodge of Minnesota, and members of Rochester Lodge #21.\n\nThe Dr. William J. Mayo House in Rochester is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWilliam J. Mayo served in World War I at the rank of Colonel (O6), as chief adviser for U.S. Army surgical services in the office of the U.S. Army Surgeon General. His brother Charles was also a Colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps and alternated with William as the associate chief adviser for surgical care of U.S. Army soldiers. When President Woodrow Wilson organized the Committee of American Physicians for Medical Preparedness in 1916, William was named its chairman and Charles as one of its members. That committee subsequently became the General Medical Board of the Council for National Defense. William was made a member of its executive committee and Charles was his alternate.\n\nDuring World War I, the Mayo Clinic continued to be busy. Many draftees were examined and war training classes were conducted for new physicians in the medical corps. William and Charles designed courses to educate military doctors on the latest scientific and surgical developments. The two brothers divided their time between Rochester and their duties in Washington, D.C. so that one of them would always be at the Clinic. This schedule took a toll on their health; Charles contracted pneumonia during one of his stints in Washington, and William developed hepatitis while in Rochester in 1918.\n\nAfter hostilities ended in November 1918, both of the Mayo brothers were promoted to the rank of Brigadier General (O7) in the U.S. Army Reserve. In addition, they both received the U.S. Distinguished Service Medal for their wartime service to the country.\n\nIn September 1931, Mayo and other prominent individuals of the time were invited by \"The New York Times\" to make a prediction concerning the world in eighty years time in the future, in 2011, to celebrate the paper's hundred-and-sixtieth anniversary since its establishment in 1851. Mayo's prediction was that the life expectancy of developed countries would reach 70 years, compared to less than sixty years in 1931.\n\n\"Three-score and ten\" means 70 years. The average life expectancy in the United States was approximately 78 years as of 2010, and it exceeded 80 years in other countries such as Japan.\n\n\n"}

In 1925, Czechoslovakia accepted the Paris convention and undertook to change to right-hand traffic \"within a reasonable time frame\". In 1931, the government decreed to change over within five years, which did not happen. The main obstacles were financial cost and widespread opposition in rural areas. In November 1938, parliament finally decided to change to right-hand traffic with effect from 1 May 1939.\n\nThe occupation of the Czech part of the country by Nazi Germany and its transformation into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (in German: \"Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren\") on 15 March 1939 sped up the change. A few places switched the same day (e.g. Ostrava), the rest of the area of the Protectorate on 17 March, and Prague got a few more days to implement the change and switched on 26 March.\n\nTramway infrastructure in Prague was modified in November 1938. In the final days there were daily reminders of the change in newspapers and large warnings were painted on the streets and on tramway cars. Drivers adapted quickly and only a small number of traffic accidents happened due to the switch with only one recorded fatality in Prague.\n\nRight hand traffic was already introduced in Slovakia by a decree of the government of \"autonomous Slovakia\" within Czechoslovakia in late 1938. After the creation of the Slovak State in March 1939, Buses in the capital Bratislava were adapted, and the last roads in Slovakia switched to the new system in 1940/1941.\n\nThe areas which are nowadays the southern border regions of Slovakia were subsequently part of Hungary (under the terms of the First Vienna Award), and did therefore change to right hand traffic as late as 1941, together with the rest of wartime Hungary.\n\n"}

He was best known as one of the great chamber music violinists of the twentieth century.\n\nSándor Végh was born in 1912 in Kolozsvár, Transylvania, Austria-Hungary, (since 1920 Cluj-Napoca, Romania). His parents were not professional musicians but folk music especially was an important part of family life. At the age of six he was given a violin, “Because”, he says, “that was cheaper than a piano. My parents had no idea how much money I had to save later to be able to buy a Stradivari.” \nHe entered the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in 1924, taking violin studies with Jenő Hubay and composition with Zoltán Kodály. He began a career as a solo violinist and in 1927, when he played a Richard Strauss composition under the composer’s baton. He graduated from the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in 1930, having won the Hubay Prize and the Reményi Prize from the institution in 1927.\n\nAs his solo career was developing, he joined the Hungarian Trio with Ilonka Krauss and László Vencze.\nIn 1934, he became one of the founding members of the Hungarian String Quartet. He was initially the first violinist, but gave that position to Zoltán Székely and took second chair. He participated with the Hungarian String Quartet in the first Hungarian performance of Béla Bartók's String Quartet No. 5.\n\nVégh left the Hungarian String Quartet in 1940 to found his own quartet, the Végh Quartet. At the first international music competition held in Genova in 1946, the Végh Quartet was awarded the first prize. He and the quartet left Hungary in 1946. The quartet continued to give concerts until the mid-1970s; Végh also made solo appearances as a violinist. \nFrom 1958 Végh played on his own Stradivari from 1724, which once belonged to Niccolò Paganini.\n\nIn the same year (1940) in which he established the quartet that bore his name, Végh became a professor at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, a position he held until 1946, when he left Hungary.\n\nIn 1952 he met cellist Pablo Casals, who invited Végh to join him in giving summer classes in Zermatt, Switzerland (1953–62), and to appear annually at Casals' Prades Festival (1953–69). He began his first recital there with Bach: the solo Sonata in g minor. Works of Bach played a special role in his life, as Végh himself declared on numerous occasions.\n\nHe found teaching rewarding, and taught at the Basel Conservatory (1953–63), in Freiburg (1954–62), Düsseldorf (1962–69), and at the Mozarteum in Salzburg (1971–97).\n\nHe founded the International Chamber Music Festival of Cervo (Liguria, Italy) in 1962, and often conducted there. He also founded an orchestra, the Sándor Végh Chamber Orchestra, which he led from 1968 to 1971, and conducted the Marlboro Festival Orchestra (1974–77). And in 1972, after visiting Cornwall (England) at Hilary Tunstall-Behrens' invitation, he co-founded the International Musicians Seminar Prussia Cove (England). In 1978 he became conductor of the Camerata Academica at the Mozarteum. With them he made a recording of Mozart’s divertimentos and serenades that won the Grand Prix du Disque in 1989.\n\nHe was awarded \"Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur\" in 1986, Doctor Honoris causa of Warwick and Exeter universities (1987), an honorary appointment as Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1988, and the Gold Medal of Salzburg in 1987.\n\nCarlos Kleiber referred to Végh as \"my conducting idol\", and said \"That man is pure music. A monster\" in letters to Charles Barber. \"He is great, wild, Asiatic... I didn't get a word in edgeways, thank God.\"\n\nVégh took French citizenship in 1953, but is perhaps best regarded as a \"world citizen of music\", having made his home in Basel and, from 1971, in Greifensee, near Zurich. He also lived in Salzburg from the 1970s onwards.\n\nAfter a short illness in 1997, he died at a hospital in Freilassing, just across the border from Salzburg. His grave is in the cemetery of the old parish church in Liefering, in the district of Salzburg.\n\n\n"}

(1951 film)\n\nGo for Broke! is a 1951 black-and-white war film directed by Robert Pirosh, produced by Dore Schary and starring Van Johnson and six veterans of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. The film co-stars Henry Nakamura, Warner Anderson, and Don Haggerty in its large cast.\n\nThe film dramatizes the real-life story of the 442nd, which was composed of Nisei (second-generation Americans born of Japanese parents) soldiers.\n\nFighting in the European theater during World War II, this unit became the most heavily decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of the United States Army, as well as one of the units with the highest casualty rates. This film is a Hollywood rarity for its era in that it features Asian Americans in a positive light, highlighting the wartime efforts of Japanese Americans on behalf of their country even while that same country confined their families in camps.\n\nAs with his earlier film script for \"Battleground\", in which Van Johnson also starred, writer-director Robert Pirosh focuses on the average squad member, mixing humor with pathos, while accurately detailing equipment and tactics used by American infantry in World War II. The contrast of reality versus public relations, the hardships of field life on the line, and the reality of high casualty rates are accurately portrayed with a minimum of heroics.\n\nIn 1979, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\n\nIn 1943 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, the newly commissioned Lt. Michael Grayson (Johnson) reports for duty to train the 442nd, a unit established on the US mainland and composed of Nisei. His expectation was to return to the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, a Texas National Guard unit, which he had served as an enlisted soldier. He has to come to terms with a group of people that he sees as Japanese, the enemy, rather than Americans. Grayson runs his platoon rather insisting on strict observance of military regulations.\n\nHe learns that \"Go for broke\" is a pidgin phrase used in Hawaii meaning to gamble everything, to \"shoot the works\"—to risk \"going broke\" or bankruptcy. Grayson comes to learn the meaning of the frequently exclaimed \"Baka tare\", which, loosely translates to mean \"very stupid.\"\n\nThere is only one brief discussion of the internment camps from which most of the men have come, but throughout the film there are references to the camps. There are also a few brief references to the distinctions between the Nisei from Hawaii (\"Buta-heads\") and those from the mainland (\"Kotonks\"). While Buta-heads (the phrase later devolved to \"Buddha-Heads\") are a key part of the Hawaiian economy and Hawaiian society, Katonks were largely distrusted and disliked by their neighbors.\n\nArriving in Italy, the unit is joined by the 100th Battalion, a Nisei unit formed in Hawaii before the 442nd. The troops of the 100th are seasoned veterans and the new arrivals look to them for advice. On the march to the front lines, Grayson gets left behind when fraternizing with a \"signorina\", but he is not found by the colonel because his platoon has covered for him during an inspection of their positions.\n\nBy the actions by the 442nd in Italy and France, Grayson finds reason to replace his bigotry with respect toward them. His transfer to the 36th, as a liaison—over his objections—comes through when the 442nd is attached to the 36th. As he has misjudged the Nisei, they have misjudged him.

He has won twenty-three Grand Slam titles: 16 in men's doubles and 7 in mixed doubles. He turned professional in 1998. With his twin brother Mike, he has been the world No. 1 doubles player for much of the last several years, first achieving the top ranking in September 2003. The brothers were named ATP Team of the Decade for 2000–2009. The brothers became the second men's doubles team to complete the career Golden Slam at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\nBob Bryan ended his 2018 season early with subsequent hip surgery in August 2018 due to an injury he sustained during his Madrid final retirement earlier in May 2018, which would have elevated the Bryan brothers as the oldest players back to the top of the men's doubles ranking if they were victorious. His recovery from hip surgery took around 5 months, which led his brother Mike primarily first partnering with fellow compatriots Sam Querrey and then more successfully Jack Sock during Bob's absence.\n\n\nHe finished the year as the no. 1 ranked singles player in the nation in 1998 after winning the clay court nationals and reaching the finals of Kalamazoo. The brothers were back-to-back Kalamazoo doubles champions in 1995 and 1996 and won the US Open Junior doubles title in 1996.\n\nHe played for Stanford University in 1997 and 1998, where he helped the Cardinal win back-to-back NCAA team championships. In 1998, he won the \"Triple Crown\" by taking the NCAA singles, doubles (with his twin brother Mike), and team titles. He was the first man to accomplish this since Stanford's Alex O'Brien did it in 1992.\n\nBoth brothers started their professional careers playing World TeamTennis for teams like the Idaho Sneakers through the current season for the Kansas City Explorers.\n\nWith his twin brother Mike (who is the older by two minutes), Bob has won 116 doubles titles, including sixteen Grand Slam titles. In 2005, the Bryan brothers made it to the finals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, only the second time a men's doubles team has done this during the open era. In 2006, the Bryan brothers won Wimbledon and the Australian Open and completed a Career Grand Slam. Having won the 2012 US Open, they followed up by winning the first three majors of 2013, and thus held all four titles at once. They could not complete the calendar year Grand Slam, however, as they lost in the semi-finals of the 2013 US Open.\n\nThe twins have been the year-ending top-ranked team ten times: in 2003 2005, 2006 and 2007, and then each year from 2009 to 2014 inclusive.\n\nThe Bryan brothers have been frequent participants on U.S. Davis Cup teams. The United States sealed its 32nd title at the 2007 Davis Cup.\n\nIn the 2018 Madrid Masters 1000 final, Bob injured his hip, and the pair had to retire down 3-5 in the first set. He underwent a hip relining and made a remarkable recovery, rejoining his brother less than a year later for the 2019 Australian Open and making it to the quarterfinals. They won their first title since his surgery in February 2020 at Delray Beach.\n\nThe Bryans guest starred on \"8 Simple Rules\" and were on the Jan/Feb 2010 cover of \"Making Music Magazine\". Their father, Wayne Bryan, wrote a book about his sons, \"The Formula: Raising Your Child to be a Champion\".\n\nBob Bryan married Florida attorney Michelle Alvarez in North Miami Beach on December 13, 2010; the couple have three children, Micaela, born January 31, 2012, Robert Blake \"Bobby Jr.\", born December 24, 2013 and Richard Charles \"Richie\" October 27, 2015.\n\nTogether with his twin brother Mike Bryan, the pair has won the most Davis Cup matches of any doubles team for the United States. Bob holds the record for most years played (14) in the Davis Cup for the U.S. He also holds a 4-2 career record in singles ties.\n\nBy winning the 2006 Wimbledon title, Bryan completed the men's doubles Career Grand Slam.

N. and Sir James Wellwood Moncreiff, 9th Baronet, a Scottish judge. He was born at his parents' Edinburgh townhouse on 13 Northumberland Street.\n\nHe was educated at Edinburgh High School then studied Law at the University of Edinburgh and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1833. He was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland in 1850, and Lord Advocate from 1851 to 1852, from 1852 to 1858, from 1859 to 1866 and from 1868 to 1869. He was Dean of the Faculty of Advocates from 1858 to 1869. He was appointed Lord Justice Clerk from 1869 to 1888.\n\nMoncreiff was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1869. He was Rector of the University of Glasgow from 1868 to 1871, and held the degrees of LLD from both Edinburgh and Glasgow universities.\n\nMoncreiff was Member of Parliament for Leith Burghs from 1851 to 1859, for Edinburgh from 1859 to 1868 and for Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities in 1868. During a long career in parliament Moncreiff guided the passing of over 100 acts of parliament, and his name is associated with the reform of legal procedure and mercantile law. As lord advocate he was engaged as public prosecutor in important cases, notably the trials of Madeline Smith, Wielobycki, and the directors of the Western bank. In 1856, he defended the \"Scotsman\" in the libel action raised by Duncan McLaren, one of the members for the city of Edinburgh.\n\nIn January 1857, Moncreiff was presented with the freedom of his native city for the part he took in regard to the Municipal Extension Act. In 1859 he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the newly-formed 1st Queen's Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Brigade (No 1 Company of which was recruited from Edinburgh advocates) – the first rifle volunteer corps in Scotland. He held the appointment until 1873 when he was appointed Honorary Colonel. In 1860, he helped pass the annuity tax bill, a subject in which, as a free churchman, he took close interest, and in the following year he carried the major bill relating to burgh and parochial schools. In 1861 he was engaged as leading counsel in the defence of Sir William Johnston, one of the directors of the Edinburgh and Glasgow bank, and in 1863-4 he was counsel in the famous Yelverton case.\n\nFor 19 years Lord Moncreiff occupied the judicial bench, presiding over the trials in the justiciary court of Chantrelle (1878), the City of Glasgow Bank directors (1878), the dynamitards (1883), and the crofters (1886).\n\nExtrajudicially Moncreiff was occupied in many other matters. As a lecturer he was in great request, and delivered numerous orations in Edinburgh and Glasgow on subjects of literary, scientific, and political interest to the Philosophical Institution, Royal Society, Juridical Society, Scots Law Society, and other bodies. Moncreiff also published anonymously in 1871 a novel entitled \"A Visit to my Discontented Cousin\", which was reprinted, with additions, from \"Fraser's Magazine\". He was also a frequent contributor to the \"Edinburgh Review\".\n\nIn 1858 Moncreiff received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. From 1868 to 1871 he was rector of the University of Glasgow from which he received a second honorary doctorate of LL.D. in 1879, and in 1869 he was appointed a member of the Privy Council. On 17 May 1871 he was created a baronet of Kilduff in the United Kingdom. On 1 January 1874 he was made a baron of the United Kingdom; in 1878 he was appointed a royal commissioner under the Endowed Institutions (Scotland) Act, and in 1883 he succeeded his brother as 11th baronet of Tullibole.\n\nIn 1870 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer was Charles Neaves. He was President of the Society 1879 to 1884.\n\nIn September 1888, Moncreiff resigned the position of Lord Justice Clerk, and took up the preparation of his \"Memorials\".

{"id": "1964018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964018", "title": "Carnegie Corporation of New York", "text": "Carnegie Corporation of New York\n\nThe Carnegie Corporation of New York is a philanthropic fund established by Andrew Carnegie in 1911 to support education programs across the United States, and later the world. Carnegie Corporation has endowed or otherwise helped to establish institutions that include the United States National Research Council, what was then the Russian Research Center at Harvard University (now known as the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies), the Carnegie libraries and the Children's Television Workshop. It also for many years generously funded Carnegie's other philanthropic organizations, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP), the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (CFAT), and the Carnegie Institution for Science (CIS).\n\nBy 1911 Andrew Carnegie had endowed five organizations in the US and three in the United Kingdom, and given more than $43 million to build public libraries and given another almost $110 million elsewhere. But ten years after he sold the Carnegie Steel Company, more than $150 million remained in his accounts and at 76, he wearied of philanthropic choices. Long-time friend Elihu Root suggested he establish a trust. Carnegie transferred most of his remaining fortune into it, and made the trust responsible for distributing his wealth after he died. Carnegie's previous charitable giving had used conventional organizational structures, but he chose a corporation as the structure for his last and largest trust. Chartered by the State of New York as the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the corporation's capital fund, originally worth about $135 million, had a market value of $1.55 billion on March 31, 1999.\n\nIn 1911-1912, Carnegie gave the corporation $125 million. At that time the corporation was the largest single philanthropic charitable trust ever established. He also made it a residual legatee under his will so it therefore received an additional $10 million, the remainder of his estate after had paid his other bequests. Carnegie reserved a portion of the corporation's assets for philanthropy in Canada and the then-British Colonies, an allocation first referred to as the Special Fund, then the British Dominions and Colonies Fund, and later the Commonwealth Program. Charter amendments have allowed the corporation to use 7.4 percent of its income in countries that are or once were members of the British Commonwealth.\n\nIn its early years Carnegie served as both president and trustee. His private secretary James Bertram and his financial agent, Robert A. Franks, acted as trustees as well and, respectively, corporation secretary and treasurer. This first executive committee made most of the funding decisions. Other seats on the board were held \"ex officio\" by presidents of five previously-established US Carnegie organizations:\n\nAfter Carnegie died in 1919, the trustees elected a full-time salaried president as the trust's chief executive officer and \"ex officio\" trustee. For a time the corporation's gifts followed the patterns Carnegie had already established. Grants for public libraries and church organs continued until 1917, and also went to other Carnegie organizations, and universities, colleges, schools, and educational agencies. Carnegie's letter of gift to the original trustees making the endowment said that the trustees would \"best conform to my wishes by using their own judgement.\" Corporation strategies changed over the years but remained focused on education, although the trust did also increasingly fund scientific research, convinced that the nation needed more scientific expertise and \"scientific management\". It also worked to build research facilities for the natural and social sciences. The corporation made large grants to the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the National Bureau of Economic Research, Stanford University's now-defunct Food Research Institute and the Brookings Institution, then became interested in adult education and lifelong learning, an obvious follow-on to Carnegie's vision for libraries as \"the university of the people\". In 1919 it initiated the Americanization Study to explore educational opportunities for adults, primarily for new immigrants.\n\nWith Frederick P. Keppel as president (1923-1941), the Carnegie Corporation shifted from creating public libraries to strengthening library infrastructure and services, developing adult education, and adding arts education to the programs of colleges and universities. The foundation's grants in this period have a certain eclectic quality and remarkable perseverance in its chosen causes.\n\nKeppel initiated a famous 1944 study of race relations in the United States by the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal in 1937 by naming a non-American outsider as manager of the study. His theory that this task should be done by someone unencumbered by traditional attitudes or earlier conclusions led to Myrdal's widely heralded book American Dilemma (1944). The book had no immediate effect on public policy, but was later much cited in legal challenges to segregation. Keppel believed foundations should make facts available and let them facts speak for themselves. His cogent writings on philanthropy made a lasting impression on field and influenced the organization and leadership of many new foundations.\n\nIn 1927 Keppel toured sub-Saharan Africa and recommended a first set of grants to establish public schools in eastern and southern Africa. Other grants went to for municipal library development in South Africa. During 1928 the corporation initiated the Carnegie Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa. Better known as the \"Carnegie Poor White Study\", it promoted strategies to improve the lives of rural Afrikaner whites and other poor whites in general. A memorandum sent to Keppel said there was \"little doubt that if the natives were given full economic opportunity, the more competent among them would soon outstrip the less competent whites\" Keppel endorsed the project that produced the report, motivated by his concern with maintaining existing racial boundaries. The corporation's concern for the so-called \"poor white problem\" in South Africa stemmed at least in part from similar misgivings about poor whites in the American South.\n\nWhite poverty defied traditional understandings of white racial superiority and thus became the subject of study. The report recommended that \"employment sanctuaries\" be established for poor white workers and that poor white workers replace \"native\" workers in most skilled aspects of the economy. The authors of the report suggested that white racial deterioration and miscegenation would be the outcome unless something was done to help poor whites, endorsing the necessity of the role of social institutions to play in the successful maintenance of white racial superiority. The report expressed trepidation concerning the loss of white racial pride, with the implicit consequence that poor whites would not successfully resist \"Africanisation.\" The report sought, in part, to forestall the historically inevitable accession of a communal, class based, democratic socialist movement aimed at uniting the poor of each race in common cause and brotherhood.\n\nWorld War II and its immediate aftermath were a relatively inactive period for the Carnegie Corporation. Charles Dollard had joined the staff in 1939 as Keppel's assistant and became president in 1948. The foundation took greater interest in the social sciences, and particularly the study of human behavior. The trust also entered into international affairs. Dollard urged it to fund quantitative, \"objective\" social science research like research in physical sciences, and help to diffuse the results through major universities. The corporation advocated for standardized testing in schools to determine academic merit regardless of the student's socio-economic background. Its initiatives have also included helping to broker the creation of the Educational Testing Service in 1947.\n\nThe corporation determined that the US increasingly needed policy and scholarly expertise in international affairs, and so tied into area studies programs at colleges and universities as well as the Ford Foundation. In 1948 the trust also provided the seed money to establish the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, today known as the Davis Center for Russia and Eurasian Studies, as an organization that could address large-scale research from both a policy and educational points of view.\n\nIn 1951 the Group Areas Act took effect in South Africa and effectively put the apartheid system into place, leading to political ascendancy for Afrikaners and dispossession for many Africans and colored people suddenly required to live in certain areas of the country only, on pain of imprisonment for remaining in possession of homes in areas designated for whites. The Carnegie corporation pulled its philanthropic endeavors from South Africa for more than two decades after this political change, turning its attention from South Africa to developing East African and West African universities instead.\n\nJohn W. Gardner was promoted from a staff position to the presidency in 1955. Gardner simultaneously became president of the CFAT, which was housed at the corporation. During Gardner's time in office the Carnegie Corporation worked to upgrade academic competence in foreign area studies and strengthened its liberal arts education program. In the early 1960s it inaugurated a continuing education program and funded development of new models for advanced and professional study by mature women. Important funding went to the key early experiments in continuing education for women, with major grants to the University of Minnesota (1960, co-directors Elizabeth L. Cless and Virginia L. Senders), Radcliffe College (1961, under President Mary Bunting), and Sarah Lawrence College (1962, under Professor Esther Raushenbush). Gardner's interest in leadership development led to the White House Fellows program in 1964.\n\nNotable grant projects in higher education in sub-Saharan Africa include the 1959-60 Ashby Commission study of Nigerian needs in postsecondary education. This study stimulated aid increases from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States to African nations' systems of higher and professional education. Gardner had a strong interest in education, but as a psychologist he believed in the behavioral sciences and urged the corporation to funded much of the US' basic research on cognition, creativity, and the learning process, particularly among young children, associating psychology and education. Perhaps its most important contribution to reform of pre-college education at this time was the series of education studies done by James B. Conant, former president of Harvard University; in particular, Conant's study of comprehensive American high schools (1959) resolved public controversy concerning the purpose of public secondary education, and made the case that schools could adequately educate both average students and the academically gifted.\n\nUnder Gardner, the corporation embraced strategic philanthropy—planned, organized, and deliberately constructed to attain stated ends. Funding criteria no longer required just a socially desirable project. The corporation sought out projects that would produce knowledge leading to useful results, communicated to decision-makers, the public, and the media, in order to foster policy debate. Developing programs that larger organizations, especially governments, could implement and scale in size became a major objective. The policy shift to institutional knowledge transfer came in part as a response to relatively diminished resources that made it necessary to leverage assets and \"multiplier effects\" to have any effect at all. The corporation considered itself a trendsetter in philanthropy, often funding research or providing seed money for ideas while others financed more costly operations. For example, ideas it advanced resulted in the \"National Assessment of Educational Progress\", later adopted by the federal government. A foundation's most precious asset was its sense of direction, Gardner said, gathering a competent professional staff of generalists that he called his \"cabinet of strategy,\" and regarded as a resource as important to the corporation as its endowment.\n\nWhile Gardner's opinion of educational equality was to multiply the channels through which an individual could pursue opportunity, it was during the term of long-time staff member Alan Pifer, who became acting president during 1965 and president during 1967 (again of both Carnegie Corporation and the CFAT), that the foundation began to respond to claims by various groups, including women, for increased power and wealth. The corporation developed three interlocking objectives: prevention of educational disadvantage; equality of educational opportunity in the schools; and broadened opportunities in higher education. A fourth objective cutting across these programs was to improve the democratic performance of government. Grants were made to reform state government as the laboratories of democracy, underwrite voter education drives, and mobilize youth to vote, among other measures. Use of the legal system became a method for achieving equal opportunity in education, as well as redress of grievance, and the corporation joined the Ford and Rockefeller foundations and others in funding educational litigation by civil rights organizations. It also initiated a multifaceted program to train black lawyers in the South for the practice of public interest law and to increase the legal representation of black people.\n\nMaintaining its commitment to early childhood education, the corporation endorsed the application of research knowledge in experimental and demonstration programs, which subsequently provided strong evidence of the long-term positive effects of high-quality early education, particularly for the disadvantaged. A 1980 report on an influential study, the Perry Preschool Project of the HighScope Educational Research Foundation, on the outcomes for sixteen-year-olds enrolled in the experimental preschool programs provided crucial evidence that safeguarded Project Head Start in a time of deep cuts to federal social programs. The foundation also promoted educational children's television and initiated the Children's Television Workshop, producer of Sesame Street and other noted children's programs. Growing belief in the power of educational television prompted creation of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, whose recommendations were adopted into the Public Broadcasting Act of 1968 that established a public broadcasting system. Many other reports on US education the corporation financed at this time, included Charles E. Silberman's acclaimed \"Crisis in the Classroom\" (1971), and the controversial \"Inequality: A Reassessment of the Effect of Family and Schooling in America\" by Christopher Jencks (1973). This report confirmed quantitative research, e.g. the Coleman Report, showed that in public schools resources only weakly correlated with educational outcomes, which coincided with the foundation's burgeoning interest in improved school effectiveness.\n\nBecoming involved with South Africa again during the mid-1970s, the corporation worked through universities to increase the legal representation of black people and increase the practice of public interest law. At the University of Cape Town, it established the Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa, this time to examine the legacies of apartheid and make recommendations to nongovernmental organizations for actions commensurate with the long-run goal of achieving a democratic, interracial society.\n\nThe influx of nontraditional students and \"baby boomers\" into higher education prompted formation of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education (1967), funded by the CFAT. (During 1972, the CFAT became an independent institution after experiencing three decades of restricted control over its own affairs.) In its more than ninety reports, the commission made detailed suggestions for introducing more flexibility into the structure and financing of higher education. One outgrowth of the commission's work was creation of the federal Pell grants program offering tuition assistance for needy college students. The corporation promoted the Doctor of Arts \"teaching\" degree as well as various off-campus undergraduate degree programs, including the Regents Degree of the State of New York and Empire State College. The foundation's combined interest in testing and higher education resulted in establishment of a national system of college credit by examination (College-Level Entrance Examination Program of the College Entrance Examination Board). Building on its past programs to promote the continuing education of women, the foundation made a series of grants for the advancement of women in academic life. Two other study groups formed to examine critical problems in American life were the Carnegie Council on Children (1972) and the Carnegie Commission on the Future of Public Broadcasting (1977), the latter formed almost ten years after the first commission.\n\nDavid A. Hamburg, a physician, educator, and scientist with a public health background, became president in 1982 intending to mobilize the best scientific and scholarly talent and thinking on \"prevention of rotten outcomes\" - from early childhood to international relations. The corporation pivoted from higher education to the education and healthy development of children and adolescents, and the preparation of youth for a scientific and technological, knowledge-driven world. In 1984 the corporation established the Carnegie Commission on Education and the Economy. Its major publication, \"A Nation Prepared\" (1986), reaffirmed the role of the teacher as the \"best hope\" for quality in elementary and secondary education. That report led to the establishment a year later of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, to consider ways to attract able candidates to teaching and recognize and retain them. At the corporation's initiative, the American Association for the Advancement of Science issued two reports, \"Science for All Americans\" (1989) and \"Benchmarks for Science Literacy\" (1993), which recommended a common core of learning in science, mathematics, and technology for all citizens and helped set national standards of achievement.\n\nA new emphasis for the corporation was the danger to world peace posed by the superpower confrontation and weapons of mass destruction. The foundation underwrote scientific study of the feasibility of the proposed federal Strategic Defense Initiative and joined the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to support the analytic work of a new generation of arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts. After the end of the USSR, corporation grants helped promote the concept of cooperative security among erstwhile adversaries and projects to build democratic institutions in the former Soviet Union and Central Europe. The Prevention of Proliferation Task Force, coordinated by a grant to the Brookings Institution, inspired the Nunn-Lugar Amendment to the Soviet Threat Reduction Act of 1991, intended to help dismantle Soviet nuclear weapons and reduce proliferation risks. More recently, the corporation addressed interethnic and regional conflict and funded projects seeking to diminish the risks of a wider war resulting from civil strife. Two Carnegie commissions, Reducing the Nuclear Danger (1990), the other Preventing Deadly Conflict (1994), addressed the dangers of human conflict and the use of weapons of mass destruction. The corporation's emphasis in Commonwealth Africa, meanwhile, shifted to women's health and political development and the application of science and technology, including new information systems, to foster research and expertise in indigenous scientific institutions and universities.\n\nDuring Hamburg's tenure, dissemination achieved even greater primacy with respect to strategic philanthropy. Consolidation and diffusion of the best available knowledge from social science and education research was used to improve social policy and practice, as partner with major institutions with the capability to influence public thought and action. If \"change agent\" was a major term during Pifer's time, \"linkage\" became a byword in Hamburg's. The corporation increasingly used its convening powers to bring together experts across disciplinary and sectoral boundaries to create policy consensus and promote collaboration.\n\nContinuing tradition, the foundation established several other major study groups, often directed by the president and managed by a special staff. Three groups covered the educational and developmental needs of children and youth from birth to age fifteen: the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development (1986), the Carnegie Task Force on Meeting the Needs of Young Children (1991), and the Carnegie Task Force on Learning in the Primary Grades (1994). Another, the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and Government (1988), recommended ways that government at all levels could make more effective use of science and technology in their operations and policies. Jointly with the Rockefeller Foundation, the corporation financed the National Commission on Teaching & America's Future, whose report, \"What Matters Most\" (1996), provided a framework and agenda for teacher education reform across the country. These study groups drew on knowledge generated by grant programs and inspired follow-up grantmaking to implement their recommendations.\n\nDuring the presidency of Vartan Gregorian the corporation reviewed its management structure and grants programs. In 1998 the corporation established four primary program headings: education, international peace and security, international development, and democracy. In these four main areas, the corporation continued to engage with major issues confronting higher education. Domestically, it emphasized reform of teacher education and examined the current status and future of liberal arts education in the United States. Abroad, the corporation sought to devise methods to strengthen higher education and public libraries in Commonwealth Africa. As a cross-program initiative, and in cooperation with other foundations and organizations, the corporation instituted a scholars program, offering funding to individual scholars, particularly in the social sciences and humanities, in the independent states of the former Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Becoming in 1847 proprietor of \"La Revue indépendante\", he was implicated in the Revolution of 1848 and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. He fled the country and during the next fifteen years lived abroad, chiefly in Italy.\n\nIn 1858 he turned his attention to ethnological research, making a special study of the Swiss lake-dwellings. He also issued three works on the evidence for early man in North Italy, the third making a then unprecedented association with the Ice Age. He returned to Paris in 1864, and soon afterwards was appointed curator of the museum at St Germain. He became mayor of the town, and in 1885 he was elected deputy for Seine-et-Oise.\n\nHe had meantime founded a review, \"Matériaux pour l'histoire positive et philosophique de l'homme\", and in conjunction with Broca assisted to found the French School of Anthropology. He died at St Germain-en-Laye on 25 September 1898.\n\nMortillet is best known for his clarification and ordering of the archeology of the Paleolithic. Where Édouard Lartet had used fauna as a distinguishing feature – Mammoth against Reindeer – for his important discoveries, Mortillet realised that as fauna varied with latitude they were unreliable indicators, and proposed instead a classification by means of dwelling places: Alluvial or Cave epochs, for example. Later acknowledging the ambiguity in that system as well, he published a new classification in 1869, using type sites and their associated artifacts to distinguish and name periods: (Chellian, Mousterian, Solutrean, Magdalenian, Robenhausen). His system may have subsequently been refined, but still remains in current use. However, whereas Mortillet believed his classifications were universal stages, with a unilineal evolution, later thinking regards each culture as a more localised conglomerate, capable of overlapping in time with others, not necessarily lineally related.\n\nMortillet proposed the name \"Marnian Epoch\" as a replacement for the period usually called the Gallic, which extends from about five centuries before the Christian era to the conquest of Gaul by Caesar. Mortillet generally objected to the term Gallic, as the civilization characteristic of the epoch was not peculiar to the ancient Gauls, but was common to nearly all Europe at the same date. The name is derived from the French département of Marne.\n\nDe Mortillet recognised the importance of the mobiliary art discovered by Lartet and Christie, commenting of such bone carvings, “They are not the work of children. They are the childhood of art”. However he was unable to accept the authenticity of the much more extensive cave art that was coming to light, conservatively and stiffly rejecting Sautuola's discovery of the paintings in Altamira as the original work of palaeolithic man.\n\n\n"}

The population was 272 at the 2010 census.\n\nEach summer, the town hosts the annual Golden State Star Party, a gathering of amateur and professional astronomers from California and parts of the United States.\n\nAdin, the first town in Modoc County west of the Warner Mountains, was founded in 1869 by Adin McDowell as the supply point for the mining town of Hayden in northern Lassen County, and was named for him in 1870. The Aidenville post office opened in 1871, and changed its name to Adin in 1876.\n\nA 1913 book described Adin as having a population of 200, and as the chief town of the Big Valley. It became a sawmill town in the mid-1930s when the Edgerton Brothers Mill moved into town, from the Adin Mountains.\n\nThe town suffered devastating fires in 1904, 1915, 1931, and finally in 1939.

Usually the mother-house was in France.\n\nAlien Priories were small dependencies of foreign religious houses. Specifically, this pertained to the English possessions of French religious houses.\n\nThe precedent went back at least as far as 912. Ælfthryth, daughter of Alfred the Great married Baldwin II, Count of Flanders. She received various properties under her father's will, and gave Lewisham Priory with its dependencies, Greenwich and Woolwich, to the abbey of St Peter at Ghent. Edward the Confessor gave the parish church at Deerhurst, and its lands to the monastery of St Denis.\n\nThe practice increased after the Norman Conquest. A number of Norman lords had founded abbeys on their lands in France, which in many cases sent monks to England to manage their property. William the Conqueror gave to the Abbey of Saint-Étienne in Caen, the manors of Frampton and Bincombe in Dorset. During the reign of William Rufus, Hamelin de Balun, founded the Benedictine priory of St Mary, at Abergavenny under the jurisdiction of the at Le Mans. The designation \"Alien Priory\" included any property owned by the French houses, regardless of whether there was an actual priory constructed upon it.\n\nSome priories enjoyed more autonomy than others. A distinction was drawn between those where the prior was appointed and served at the will of the abbot of the motherhouse, and those where the prior was elected by the monks. In the latter case, the land was vested in the priory and could not be sold by the abbot. The priories paid an apport, a nominal fixed sum, annually to the mother-house.\n\nA medieval abbey which held distant estates normally administered them by establishing a small cell or priory of two or three monks to manage a manor or group of manors and send the profits to the mother-house. King John compelled them to pay into the royal treasury the apport. During the reign of King Henry III (1216-1272), many alien priories were suppressed by Simon de Montfort's Parliament (the Parliament of Leicester, 1265), and their revenues were taken into the king's hands. The Crown, however, in most cases transferred the property to other monasteries.\n\nIn 1294, when King Edward I of England was at war with France, many of the alien priories were seized, numbering about a hundred, and their revenues were used to help pay for the war. In order to prevent the foreign monks in southern coastal areas giving possible help to invaders, he deported many of them to other religious houses that were twenty or more miles from the coast.\n\nKing Edward II of England subsequently followed this example, taking the alien priories into his own hands, but he not infrequently appointed their priors custodians for a consideration, obliging them to pay to the Crown the apport due to their superiors.\n\nWhen Edward III came to the throne, he restored many of the alien priories to their original owners and waived the arrears of payments due to the Crown. But ten years later, when war broke out again with France, he reverted to the policy of his predecessors, and again seized the property of these French aliens. For twenty-three years, these foreign houses remained in his hands; but with the peace of 1361 most of them were restored, only to be again sequestrated eight years later when the war was renewed. In the time of Richard II, the alien priories continued mostly in the hands of the Crown.\n\nIn 1378, all the monks in alien priories were expelled from England. Most finally came to an end under Henry V in 1414, with a few exceptions surviving, for example Modbury Priory.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964078", "title": "Crash Dive", "text": "Crash Dive\n\nCrash Dive is a World War II film in Technicolor released in 1943. It was directed by Archie Mayo, written by Jo Swerling and W.R. Burnett, and starred Tyrone Power, Dana Andrews and Anne Baxter. The film was the last for Power, already enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, before assignment to recruit training.\n\nUS Navy submarine USS \"Corsair\", operating in the North Atlantic, hunts out German merchant raiders preying on Allied shipping. Its new executive officer, Lt. Ward Stewart (Tyrone Power), has been transferred to submarines after commanding his own PT boat. At the submarine base in New London, Connecticut, he asks his new captain, Lieutenant Commander Dewey Connors (Dana Andrews), for a weekend leave to settle his affairs before taking up his new assignment. On a train bound for Washington D.C., Stewart accidentally encounters New London school teacher Jean Hewlett (Anne Baxter) and her students. Despite her initial resistance to his efforts, he charms her and they fall in love.\n\nHis infatuation with PT boats irritates Connors but the two become friends after engaging a Q ship in which Connors is injured and Stewart sinks it. Connors, unbeknownst to Stewart, is already in love with Jean but delays marrying her until he gains a promotion to commander, and the commensurate pay raise it provides, so he can properly support her. Tension between the men ensues when Connors discovers that the woman Stewart is wooing is Jean. The film culminates in a commando raid by \"Corsair\" on an island supply base for the German raiders. After the raid, the two men make peace, and after the \"Corsair\"s return to New London, Stewart and Jean are married.\n\nAs appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):\nPart of the movie was filmed at Submarine Base New London, Connecticut. A few naval combatants rarely seen in Technicolor are visible in the early part of the film. The PT boats seen near the beginning are the 77-foot Elco type. The submarine primarily featured as \"Corsair\" was the experimental , with a conning tower modified to resemble her sister . A few O-class and R-class submarines, built in World War I and used for training in World War II, are visible in the background of some shots. For wartime security reasons, no submarine classes used in combat in World War II appear in the film. is seen in one shot; there are probably not many good Technicolor views of a four-stack destroyer available today. \"Semmes\" was being used as a sonar testbed at the time.\n\nOne of the scenes in the movie was similar to that in the film \"Destination Tokyo\" (1943) starring Cary Grant, where the submarines follow an enemy tanker into their naval base through a minefield. Another similar plot theme was in the 1954 movie \"Hell and High Water\" about an island base to be used to launch a Boeing B-29 Superfortress in U.S. markings for an atomic bomb attack.\n\nOne interesting feature of the film is the significant role of African-American actor Ben Carter as messman Oliver Cromwell Jones. While most World War II movies (particularly those made during the war) feature few, if any, African-American characters, \"Crash Dive\" is a notable exception. Although Carter plays a stereotypical role as a low ranking sailor, his character is more developed than most African-American character of the time by being shown to be a confidant to a higher ranking crewmember. Jones (Ben Carter) also participates in a commando raid late in the film. A scene which subtly comments on the racial mores of the time depicts the white sailors blackening their faces in preparation for that nighttime raid. Upon walking in and seeing them Jones laughs then reports loudly \"I'm the only born commando here!\".\n\nThe film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects (Fred Sersen, Roger Heman Sr.) at the 16th Academy Awards.\n\n"}
{"id": "1964080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964080", "title": "Detroit Wheels", "text": "Detroit Wheels\n\nThe Detroit Wheels were an American football team, a charter member of the World Football League.\n\nSoon after Gary Davidson announced the WFL's formation in October 1973, he was approached by a man named Bud Hucul about putting a team in Detroit. In a harbinger of things to come, however, it emerged that Hucul had a long history of legal problems, including 30 arrests and 27 lawsuits.\n\nA more credible offer came from a consortium of ten Detroit-area investors who were formally awarded a franchise on December 13, 1973. The group would eventually expand to 33 people, including singer Marvin Gaye, Motown Records vice-president Esther Edwards, Milford Fabricating owner Edward Nishon and Little Caesars founder Mike Ilitch—who would later own the Red Wings and Tigers. Detroit attorney and philanthropist Louis Lee was named team president, while Sonny Grandelius, a former star running back at Michigan State, was the team's general manager.\n\nThe WFL was plagued by a number of teams who were badly underfinanced, to the point of not having enough money to meet the most basic expenses. However, it soon became clear that the Wheels were severely undercapitalized even by WFL standards. The owners didn't appear to make an initial capital investment; instead, team expenses were seemingly paid out-of-pocket as they arose. In the WFL player draft, Detroit selected such future stars as Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones, Rick Middleton and Randy Grossman. Unfortunately, the Wheels initially refused to spend more than $10,000 per player, and thus wound up signing only three of their 33 draft picks. Desperate for players, the Wheels were forced to hold open tryouts, but none of the 665 men who tried out made the team.\n\nThey also had trouble finding a place to play. Their first choice was Tiger Stadium, home of the NFL's Detroit Lions and Major League Baseball's Detroit Tigers. However, they were unable to get a lease due to pressure from the Lions (also, much of the WFL season coincided with baseball's). The Silverdome hadn't been built yet, and University of Detroit Stadium (home of the Continental Football League's Michigan Arrows) had been demolished three years prior. Lee approached his alma mater, the University of Michigan, about playing at cavernous Michigan Stadium, only to be turned down. Finally, the Wheels signed a deal to play at Eastern Michigan University's 15,500-seat Rynearson Stadium in Ypsilanti, Michigan, 37 miles from downtown Detroit. The stadium had no lighting at the time, and the Wheels had to install their own (the lights remain on the stadium to this day). The club even hired EMU's head coach, Dan Boisture, to helm the Wheels.\n\nThings weren't too encouraging on the field, either. The Wheels had a decent quarterback in Bubba Wyche (brother of former NFL quarterback and head coach Sam Wyche), but little in the way of protection (Wyche was sacked eleven times in one game) or receivers. Only 10,631 people attended their first home game, and their final home contest drew an announced crowd of 6,351 fans (though actual attendance was closer to 2,000). One home game, against the Portland Storm, was moved to J.W. Little Stadium in London, Ontario; Storm owner Robert Harris was from London, and actually considered moving his club to the Ontario city and renaming them the London Lords, adopting the name of the recently folded semi-pro team of that name. (The Canadian government, however, was firmly against the idea of any US-based pro football league playing in their country; they had threatened to pass the Canadian Football Act a few months prior, which forced a proposed Toronto team to move to Memphis instead.) Harris received $30,000 from local promoters and the Storm got their first win of the year, 18-7, in front an announced crowd of 5,105 (newspaper reports indicated there were only 2,000 people there). It was the only \"World\" Football League game played outside the United States.\n\nAs the losses piled up, the team's ramshackle financial structure became more problematic. Boisture and Grandelius badly wanted to put together a serious football organization, but the owners refused all requests for more money. According to Grandelius, the owners \"panicked\" when they realized how dire the situation was, and simply walked away, making the Wheels essentially a club team in a professional league. For one home game there were no programs available because the printer hadn't been paid. Several practices were canceled because the laundry bill went unpaid, leaving the team without uniforms. They couldn't pay their phone bill, and they were unable to reserve hotel rooms or fly to away games without advance payment. Players were forced to share food and rent due to missed paydays; several players ended up sharing a house. Wide receiver Jon Henderson had to pay his son's hospital bill out of pocket after finding out the team's insurance policy was practically worthless. The situation prompted Wyche to write to league president Gary Davidson and beg the league office to intervene.\n\nMedia coverage was spotty at best. Only two Wheels games were ever televised: the season-opening loss to Memphis on July 10, and the August 22 contest against Chicago in Ypsilanti, by TVS. (The game against the Fire was not seen in Detroit, however: it was blacked-out on the network's local affiliate, WKBD-TV.) TVS had also planned to carry the September 25 game at New York, but begged off because the lighting at New York's Downing Stadium was inadequate for broadcast. In any case, both teams were on the brink of extinction by the time of the game. On radio, WWJ-AM carried all but one Wheels game, the July 21 contest in Hawaii.\n\nThe coaches were also feeling the effects as well. At least one assistant coach was forced to live in the basement of another coach; several landlords refused to rent houses to him when they found out he worked for the Wheels. Boisture was unable to film any games because the owners refused to provide filming equipment. The low point came during the Wheels' eighth game, against the Philadelphia Bell. When the players arrived at John F. Kennedy Stadium, they discovered that there were no medical supplies or tape available. The Wheels refused to take the field until a Johnson & Johnson salesman donated tape so that the game could go on. (Philadelphia won, 27-23.)\n\nAfter losing their first ten games, the Wheels got their only win, 15-14 over the Florida Blazers at Orlando. Soon afterward, the league took control of the team and began searching for a new home. Their first choice was Shreveport, but the Houston Texans moved there instead and became the Steamer. They then tried to move to Louisville, but talks collapsed. Automaker John DeLorean tried to buy the team in hopes of keeping it in Detroit, but backed out at the last minute. The next choice was Charlotte, where former New England Patriots general manager Upton Bell was hoping to put together financing for a WFL team. Although impressed with Wyche, he was unable to come to an agreement, and instead opted to buy the New York Stars and move \"them\" to Charlotte, as the Hornets.\n\nWith underfinanced ownership, an ever-changing roster (no fewer than 83 players appeared in least one contest for Detroit in 1974, in just 14 games), a recession in the country, a non-existent fan base, and just plain bad luck, the Wheels had no chance to succeed. The schedule-maker offered Detroit no favors, either; the Wheels' first six contests were all against playoff teams. Ultimately, no fewer than ten of their 14 opponents qualified for the WFL post-season. Two of the other four games were against Chicago, who struggled in the second half of the season but were still hot when they met Detroit; and New York, who after moving to Charlotte actually qualified for the playoffs, only to be forced out of a wild-card game against Florida due to inadequate ticket sales.\n\nOn September 24, the Wheels stumbled into New York to play the Stars, in a game that had been transferred from Ypsilanti to Randall's Island (and also moved up a day because of Yom Kippur); that same day, the Wheels filed for bankruptcy. The Stars won easily, 37-7, then announced they would transfer to Charlotte. A week later, Detroit dropped a 14-11 decision to the former Houston franchise, now in Shreveport (coincidentally, one of the cities the Wheels had considered moving to); this would turn out to be the last game the Wheels would ever play. On October 7, in the face of $1.4 million in claims, Davidson postponed the Wheels' upcoming game against the Chicago Fire, and announced that the league would fold the team unless new owners could be found within three days. No buyers cropped up, and the Wheels vanished, along with the equally cash-strapped Jacksonville Sharks. While the franchise officially folded on October 10, players and coaches had been taking their uniforms and personal items home with them for some time to keep them from being seized. The Wheels franchise was the only one not reissued when the World Football League returned in 1975.\n\nThe Wheels finished their abbreviated season with the WFL's worst record at 1-13. However, considering their dire off-the-field situation, they were far more competitive than their record indicated: eight of their losses came by less than a touchdown, and they held fourth-quarter leads in seven games. Playing in the tough Central Division with the league's two best teams, Memphis (17-3) and Birmingham (15-5), made things even more difficult for the hapless Wheels.\n\nAfter the debacle, Dan Boisture, who had helmed successful teams at the high school and college levels, decided to leave coaching altogether. \"When the Wheels went defunct, I could have gone with a couple pro teams, and I said, 'That's it.'...I was in a position to continue in pro ball or get something more stable. I made the right choice.\"\n\nFuture professional wrestler Stan Hansen attended the Wheels training camp, but was cut. Nevertheless, he was promoted as a \"former star\" of the team when wrestling in a promotion in his hometown of Amarillo, Texas.\n\n"}
{"id": "1964081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964081", "title": "Angelus Oaks, California", "text": "Angelus Oaks, California\n\nAngelus Oaks is an unincorporated community in San Bernardino County, California, United States, and has a population of 535 as of the 2010 U.S. Census, up from an estimated population of 312 in 2000. It is surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest and located northeast of Redlands on California State Route 38.\n\nAngelus Oaks was initially called Camp Angelus. In 1849 there was a big gold strike in Holcomb Valley, north of Bear Valley and near the town that was later to become Big Bear. The only way to get supplies in and the gold out was by mule trains. The mule train traveled up the Santa Ana River Canyon, stopping overnight in Seven Oaks and then took a switch back trail (Clark's Grade...still visible on the mountain across from the Angelus Oaks Lodge) up to the gold fields. Eventually, a wagon road was built to replace the mule skinner trail. But, the Santa Ana River kept washing out the wagon road within the rugged canyon, and so another, better road, known as a 'Control Road', (because traffic was allowed to proceed one-way in each direction only, with controls stationed at each end) was built in nearby Mill Creek Canyon. The \"Lower Control Road\" started at Mountain Home Village, in Mill Creek Canyon, and ended in Camp Angelus, at the Lodge. (The Lower Control Road later became known as Mountain Home Creek Road.) \"Middle Control Road\" started just east of the Lodge and meandered down to Seven Oaks. The final control road, 'Clark's Grade', went up and over the north side of the Santa Ana Canyon and into Bear Valley. The Clark Brothers, based at Clark's Ranch north and west of Seven Oaks, scratched out their control road by hand, and collected fees for its use.\n\nIn the late 1870s, cattle rustlers, operating out of San Bernardino, would bring their stolen herds up to nearby Glen Martin, just below Camp Angelus in Mountain Home Canyon, to hide them. Due to the configuration of the opening of the mountain down by the Ranger Station, the opening to the canyon was not visible to posses passing by searching for the stolen herds.\n\nBeginning in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the stagecoach, using the old wagon road, would bring passengers and mail from Redlands up Mill Creek, then Mountain Home Creek (Lower Control Road), through Camp Angelus, on to Seven Oaks via Middle Control Road and then up the back side of the mountain to Big Bear. The now Angelus Oaks Lodge was first built as a stagecoach stop for changing horses at the top of the climb and for serving up sandwiches to passengers. It also served as a small grocery store for the local community. The original wagon road is the small road that now runs along the front of the Lodge and crosses over to the current chain up turn-out (Middle Control Road).\n\nIn 1919, with automobiles now traveling up the road to Big Bear, the Angelus Oaks Lodge became a perfect spot to replenish the water in their radiators. A few cabins were built by two brothers that owned the Lodge at that time. These crude cabins were nothing more than four walls and contained only cots for sleeping and a wood-burning stove for heat and cooking.\n\nThe original school was a log cabin on a hill located behind and rented from Glen Lodge. This lodge had a full restaurant, bar, gas and repair station, grocery store, hotel, cabins, and a dance hall with a large fireplace. In 1953 the first teacher, originally from South Dakota and a graduate of USC, was Orville Young. He lived with his family in Camp Angelus and taught the community children from 5–13 years of age at Camp Angelus Elementary. In 1956 the natural wood clad (later painted red) one-room school-house serving grades 1-7 was built, and closed permanently in 2004. Glen Lodge burned down in the late sixties.\n\nIn the 1970s, when the postal service decided to combine the two small post offices of Camp Angelus and Seven Oaks, closing the Seven Oaks location, they renamed the remaining office \"Angelus Oaks.\" That name stuck with the town. It was at this time that the Lodge was abandoned and fell into disrepair.\n\nIn 1987, the lodge was purchased by a couple living at that time in Long Beach, California. The lodge and cabins were restored over a 2-year period and heaters and showers were added to the cabins. The lodge and surrounding cabins became a livable resort for individuals wanting to get away from the hectic city life below. Over the years, full bathrooms, kitchens, and even some dividing walls for bedrooms were added. Beginning in 2012 and continuing through 2015, the Lodge and its outer cabins once again underwent a major restoration. As of January 2015, 8 of the original 12 cabins have been completely restored, and the Lodge is open for viewing. The cabins are available to rent on a nightly basis and are operated under a special use permit provided by the USDA Forest Service.\n\nOn February 12, 2013, in a rural area east of Angelus Oaks, the search for Christopher Dorner ended after a standoff with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. He was the primary suspect in a series of shootings.\n\nIts downtown consists of a general store, a restaurant, a post office (ZIP code 92305) and a real estate office. A San Bernardino County Fire Station (Station 98) is also downtown, and a San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department Resident Deputy (one of only three in the entire County) lives nearby. The State of California's Department of Transportation (CalTrans) and the United States Forest Service also have a presence in downtown Angelus Oaks. Two private water companies service the residents of Angelus Oaks. Within the town lies the historical Angelus Oaks Lodge, which originally served as a stagecoach stop for passengers traveling up the mountain to Big Bear, and is now available for overnight visitors.\n\nAngelus Oaks has become a favorite to bicyclists due to its proximity to the Santa Ana River Trail (S.A.R.T.) which is renowned for its grandeur and challenge. For hikers, Angelus Oaks offers the San Bernardino Peak Hiking Trail (1W07) and the Vivian Creek Trail. There are also other less vigorous trails situated throughout the San Gorgonio Wilderness. The Angelus Oaks Lodge offers a great overnight and staging area for bikers and hikers wishing to get an early morning start.\n\nA few miles past Angelus Oaks, in the Barton Flats area, there are multiple public Forest Service campsites and group camps run by various churches and non-profit organizations, including YMCA and Jewish Community Center of Orange County. The two largest and most active camps are the Boy Scout Camp Tahquitz owned by the Long Beach Boy Scouts (it was developed from a very private summer tent camp with one snack store to one serving thousands of scouts year round with a mess hall, clinic, garage/fire station, swimming and fishing lake, camp offices, and rangers' quarters developed, built, and maintained under the watchful eye of the Camp Ranger, Glen McIntosh, from 1957 until his death in 1981), and Camp Cedar Falls, 5 km (3 miles) past Angelus Oaks on Highway 38 run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Jenks Lake hosts fishing and some swimming activities.\n\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Angelus Oaks, California has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csb\" on climate maps.\n\n"}

Part of a family that first emigrated to America in the 17th century, the Applegates bought acreage above Clipper Gap, California, and established a fruit ranch there. The main house of the Applegate Ranch was where Oliver's gas station and bar sits today. Lisbon eventually returned to Missouri but his son, George W.

{"id": "1964091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964091", "title": "Next (2007 film)", "text": "Next (2007 film)\n\nNext is a 2007 American science fiction action thriller film directed by Lee Tamahori and starring Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel, Thomas Kretschmann, Tory Kittles, and Peter Falk. The film's original script was loosely based on the 1954 science fiction short story \"The Golden Man\" by Philip K. Dick. The film tells the story of Cris Johnson, a small-time magician based in Las Vegas, who has limited precognition; his ability allows him to see into the very immediate future. His gift makes him a target not only of a highly motivated and heavily armed group of terrorists, but also wanted by the FBI to help them fight those same terrorists.\n\nThe film was released on April 25, 2007, in Belgium and France, and on April 27, 2007, in the United States by Paramount Pictures. With a production budget of $78 million, the film grossed $76 million worldwide, making it a box office flop.\n\nCris Johnson can see into his future. He can only see two minutes ahead, with the exception of a vision he once had of a woman walking into a diner. Knowing no details other than the time, he goes to the diner twice each day at 8:09 to await her arrival. He works as a small-time magician in Las Vegas, where he supplements his income with gambling, using his powers to win medium amounts against the house.\n\nCris draws the attention of FBI agent Callie Ferris, who has figured out his ability and wants to stop Russian terrorists from detonating a nuclear weapon. Before she can approach Cris, his gambling draws the attention of casino security. Using his ability to forecast the actions of his pursuers, he eludes them and the Las Vegas police. Ferris tracks Cris to his location, but he escapes after foreseeing her arrival. Later that night, the casino's security chief is approached by two of the terrorists, is interrogated about Johnson and is then killed.\n\nThe following morning, Cris is at the diner again when he sees Liz Cooper, the woman from his vision. It turns out that Cris can not only see the future, but also see how his actions can affect that future. When Liz's aggressive ex-boyfriend arrives, Johnson envisions all outcomes of his intervening, and then chooses the outcome that gets him \"in\" with Liz. Knowing that she is heading for Flagstaff, Arizona, Cris tricks her into giving him a ride. Ferris follows, while the terrorists decide to kill him.\n\nWith the weapon tracked to Los Angeles, Ferris convinces her superiors to let her bring Cris in. The terrorists follow in the hope that the agents will lead them to Cris.\n\nCris and Liz have to spend the night in a motel. Ferris confronts Liz near the hotel. Claiming Cris is a dangerous sociopath, Ferris asks Liz to drug Cris so that they can bring him in peacefully. Instead, Liz warns Cris, who tells her his secret. When she asks why he will not help the FBI stop the terrorists, he explains his limitations, noting the exception for events involving her. Cris tries to escape from the FBI but is captured after saving Ferris from logs tumbling down the side of a mountain. Unable to get to Cris, the terrorists kidnap Liz.\n\nThe FBI strap Cris to a chair and force him to watch television until he has a vision that can help. They expect him to see a report about the detonation of the bomb, but instead he envisions a broadcast from several hours in the future in which Liz is killed with a bomb vest while strapped to a wheelchair as bait for him. Cris escapes and races to the parking garage where she will be killed. Catching up to him, Ferris promises to help save Liz as long as Cris will help stop the bomb; she also sets up a plan to draw out the terrorists.\n\nCris helps the FBI track the terrorists to the port where they are based. When they arrive, Cris is able to walk right up to the terrorist leader while using his power to dodge bullets. After killing the terrorists and saving Liz, they find that the bomb has already been moved. Ferris shows Cris a seismograph, hoping that he will see any tremors caused by explosions before they happen. As he stares at the screen he realizes that he has made a mistake and that he was too late: the bomb detonates out at sea and completely destroys the port, as well as the rest of the city.\n\nThe timeline reverts a full day to Cris and Liz in bed at the hotel in Arizona, before Ferris arrived. Because of Liz's involvement in events, Cris has now been able to envision everything that could happen leading to the nuclear explosion. \"Every time you look into the future, it changes.\"\n\nCris calls Ferris and offers to help prevent the nuclear disaster, then asks Liz to wait for him.\n\nGary Goldman and Jason Koornick initially optioned the science fiction short story \"The Golden Man\" by Philip K. Dick. Goldman wrote a script treatment that he and Koornick presented to Nicolas Cage's production company, Saturn Films, but Goldman ended up writing the screenplay on spec.\n\nThis first draft had more similarities to the short story, detailing the efforts of a government agency to capture and contain a precognitive mutant.\n\nTo provide greater interaction between the opposing parties (as well as create a leading role), Cris was changed from a feral animal whose existence threatened humanity's into a more familiar and understandable social outcast. A romantic subplot was added: the character of Liz Cooper, who in this draft was not only destined to be the love of Cris's life, but a mutant as well (born in Love Canal) and the only woman he has ever met with whom he can have children, herself incapable of procreating with normal humans.\n\nAs the original short story had a distinct tone of racist paranoia, the motivation for the pursuit of Cris was changed from an ironclad policy of exterminating mutations to a manipulative Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent's obsessive search for unconventional assets in the war on terror.\n\nThis script was filled with anti-authoritarian themes, with Cris often speaking clearly and eloquently of how he enjoys his independence. He states plainly that \"what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up.\"\n\nThe DHS is explicitly depicted as a completely unregulated, astoundingly powerful and unapologetically ruthless collection of fanatics, breaking laws without consideration and eager to torture and even murder innocent civilians to achieve their objectives. They discuss their plans in using Cris as if he were a piece of machinery, most of which consist of using him as a \"timescope\": that is, bolting him into a chair for the rest of his life so his only experiences are ones which are useful to them, a process which they believe would extend the range of his abilities. One agent suggests that they amputate his arms and legs, a suggestion his colleague considers humorous.\n\nHowever, his enemies are skilled tormentors and eventually they drive him to the breaking point: when the DHS learns that Liz is pregnant with his child, they coldly decide to have her executed at a pre-determined time, thus pre-emptively proving to Cris their determination to possess him. He attempts to secure Liz's safety, but the DHS captures her. In retaliation, he demolishes the Las Vegas DHS headquarters with a barrel of C-4 explosive agents had seized earlier in a warrant-less search. He and Liz are the \"only\" survivors.\n\nSaturn Films had the script extensively rewritten and in the process almost completely eliminated its anti-authoritarian themes. Though Cris remained a meek social outcast, he is somewhat less sympathetic: he is portrayed as arrogant, as well as far more prone to applying violent solutions. The DHS's role was replaced with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Despite a scene in which Cris experiences his worst nightmare – spending the rest of his life strapped into a chair with his eyes wedged open – the authorities are portrayed as sympathetic and Cris as uncooperative and belligerent. Their insistence on his obedience is reduced to the point that the authorities offer their assistance in \"rescuing\" Liz (whom they neglect to arrest despite her efforts to sabotage Cris's capture) from the terrorists. This leads to the film's greatest variation from the original draft – a confrontation with the terrorists. No clue is given as to the motivation for the terrorists' detonation of the nuclear device in Los Angeles. The few terrorists who speak in the film with British, French and German accents, seem to be under the guidance of an unseen leader who has told them that they must kill Cris since \"he says that Cris is the only threat to the plan\". During the confrontation with the terrorists, Cris willingly supports the FBI with his abilities in a series of sequences similar to those in the original script, only with the authorities as allies instead of antagonists.\n\nThis was the script Saturn Films brought to the attention of Revolution Studios. Revolution Studios acquired the screenplay and in November 2004, Revolution Studios hired Lee Tamahori to direct the film, with Cage in the lead role. Filming was to begin in summer 2005. In December 2005, Moore was cast as the federal agent who seeks people to help prevent future terrorism and uncovers Cage's character as a potential candidate. In November 2005, Initial Entertainment Group negotiated for rights of international distribution of \"Next\", which had a target release date of 2007. In February 2006, actress Jessica Biel was cast as the love interest of Cage's character.\n\nIn May 2006, Starz! Entertainment's 14-episode reality television miniseries, \"Looking for Stars\", gave 200 contestants the opportunity to earn a speaking role in \"Next\", which was won by actor Marcus Welch.\n\nSections of the film were filmed in the San Bernardino Mountains in California. Mountain locations used in production of the film included Crestline, Running Springs and Big Bear Lake. The hotel featured in the film, \"The Cliffhanger\", is actually a restaurant overlooking the City of San Bernardino. In order to make the restaurant look more like a hotel, a facade was attached to the building. The facade is the section of the motel where Johnson and Liz Cooper were staying. Interior shots were filmed elsewhere. Following the end of production, the facade was removed. However, remnants of the signage placed and the paint works conducted remain intact. Running Springs served for scenes shot in the town. Scenes (in which a vehicle was rolled off the side of a cliff) shot in Big Bear Lake were shot at a campground. Due to the terrain located on the side of the cliff the Cliffhanger is located on, the producers decided to finish the scenes at the campground in Big Bear Lake.\n\n\"Next\" originally was to be distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment (which had a deal with Revolution), set to be released on September 28, 2006, but that studio dumped it in January 2007, and Paramount Pictures subsequently picked it up and released the film on April 27, 2007.\n\nThe film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office, grossing $7.1 million in 2,725 theaters in its opening weekend. In its eight-week run in the United States, it grossed a total of just $18 million and has a combined worldwide gross of $76 million. Compared to other films based on Philip K. Dick stories, \"Next\" grossed less than \"Minority Report\", \"Total Recall\", \"Paycheck\" and \"Blade Runner\" but performed better than \"Impostor\", \"Screamers\" and \"A Scanner Darkly\".\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 28% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Numerous plot holes and poorly motivated characters prevent \"Next\" from being the thought-provoking sci-fi flick it could've been.\" \nMetacritic gives the film had an average score of 42 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" said the film plays \"like the cinematic equivalent of a Choose Your Own Adventure novel\" and that the plot is highly reminiscent of \"24\". Chang also said \"What starts out as a mildly diverting thriller blows itself to smithereens in the final reel\", describing the climax as a \"stunning cheat.\" \nJames Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars and said parts of the film are \"fascinating\" and \"compelling\" but that \"the whole thing ends up collapsing under its own weight.\" Berardinelli said Nicolas Cage \"seems to be going through the motions\", \"Julianne Moore brings intensity to the part of Callie, although the character is incomplete\", \"Jessica Biel is appealing\" but \"the character is unfinished\", and that \"Thomas Kretschmann is unimpressive as a generic \"24\"-style terrorist.\" He also said \"some viewers will feel cheated by what \"Next\" does, and it's hard to blame them.\" \nConnie Ogle of the \"Miami Herald\" gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said the film looks like director Lee Tamahori \"spent about 12 bucks on his special effects budget.\" Ogle said the film had a decent premise but \"\"Next\" begins to seriously embarrass itself and its stars once it rolls to its climax.\" \n\"Toronto Star\" film critic Peter Howell gave the film 1½ stars out of 4 and called it a \"colossal waste of time\" and said it is \"possibly the most egregious befouling of Dick's work to date.\" Howell said the roles \"seem to be cut-and-pasted from other movies\", called the film a \"straight-to-DVD wannabe\", and said the film \"has one of the most infuriating endings ever.\"\n\nMoira MacDonald of the \"Seattle Times\" gave \"Next\" 1½ stars out of 4 and said \"Late in the movie, Cris shouts at a bad guy, 'I've seen every possible ending here. None of them are good for you.' It's as if he's talking to the audience, and alas, he's right.\" and \"Julianne Moore spends most of her screen time in Lee Tamahori's confused sci-fi thriller \"Next\" looking royally pissed off, like she got tricked into making the movie on a sucker bet. You can't blame her; this film's audience is likely to look that way as well by the time the end credits roll.\" \n\"Kalamazoo Gazette\" critic James Sanford gave the film 1½ stars and said \"the only visions \"Next\" inspires are flashbacks to better films\" like \"Honeymoon in Vegas\", \"Leaving Las Vegas\", \"The Illusionist\", and \"Hannibal\", adding \"any film that makes someone wish he or she were watching \"Hannibal\" must be pretty awful.\" Sanford said \"Cage performs as if he's on autopilot, Moore looks more miserable than she did as the suicidal housewife in \"The Hours\", and Biel seems fully aware she was hired only to provide a few glimpses of cheesecake.\" Sanford also remarked, \"the ending of this film is not just a colossal cheat, it's a hard slap in the face to anyone who has invested his or her time in watching it.\" \nDaniel Eagan of \"Film Journal International\" said the film \"follows a familiar Hollywood pattern in which a few intriguing ideas are swamped by the demands of a big-budget, star-driven vehicle\" and that it \"won't add any luster to Nicolas Cage's resume.\" Eagan said \"Half of \"Next\" is a clever, unpredictable thriller that plays with Dick's customary obsessions with time and reality. The other half is a sloppy, bloated adventure marred by cheesy special effects and some equally cheesy acting\" and also that \"the script to \"Next\" has plenty of [plot jams], one or two egregious enough to demand ticket refunds.\"\n\n\"Orlando Sentinel\" critic Roger Moore gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and said \"who says preposterous junk can't be fun?\" Moore said \"this sloppy little time travel variation is a crowd-pleasing hoot, thanks mostly to Cage turning on the charisma and showing off his gift for hangdog understatement\" and that the \"Groundhog Day\"-like attempts to woo Jessica Biel's character are \"hilarious.\" Moore concluded \"It's all so stupid and ends so perfunctorily that you can't call \"Next\" good, or even as good as the dopey \"Déjà Vu\"...but it does score over [\"Déjà Vu\"] in one important criterion. It's just fun.\" \nWesley Morris of the \"Boston Globe\" gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars and called it a \"watchably absurd popcorn flick\" and that the film \"bears almost no resemblance\" to the original short story \"The Golden Man\", the short story it was adapted from. He described Moore's performance as \"enjoyably curt\" and said \"alongside Cage's spontaneity, Biel seems humorless and earnestly dull.\" Morris said the film is fun \"until it turns crass\" and concluded, \"when you're being toyed with that cheaply, you forget how much you admire Nicolas Cage's shamelessness and start to resent the movie's.\" Diana Saenger of \"ReviewExpress\" gave the film 3½ stars and said \"\"Next\" boasts a fresh plot with a tricky twist ending that can be misconstrued if you don't pay close attention and then pause to think about it.\" Saenger reported that it was Nicolas Cage's idea for Cris to be a magician, and that it was his suggestion that his wife be part of the scene where a woman comes out of the audience to be part of the magic show. Saenger remarked that people complaining about the twist being a rip-off probably didn't understand it and said it made perfect sense and concluded \"I liked the surprise twist and found \"Next\" very entertaining.\"\n\nThe film was subject to the heckling of Bridget Jones Nelson and Michael J. Nelson in an October 2007 installment of \"Rifftrax\".\n\n"}

For the building of the Temple, which promoted peace, it was inappropriate to use tools that could also cause war and bloodshed. \n\nReferenced throughout the Talmud and the Midrashim, the Shamir was reputed to have existed in the time of Moses, as one of the ten wonders created on the eve of the first Sabbath, just before YHWH finished creation. Moses reputedly used the Shamir to engrave the Hoshen (Priestly breastplate) stones that were inserted into the breastplate. King Solomon, aware of the existence of the Shamir, but unaware of its location, commissioned a search that turned up a \"grain of Shamir the size of a barley-corn\".\n\nSolomon's artisans reputedly used the Shamir in the construction of Solomon's Temple. The material to be worked, whether stone, wood or metal, was affected by being \"shown to the Shamir.\" Following this line of logic (anything that can be 'shown' something must have eyes to see), early Rabbinical scholars described the Shamir almost as a living being. Other early sources, however, describe it as a green stone. For storage, the Shamir was meant to have been always wrapped in wool and stored in a container made of lead; any other vessel would burst and disintegrate under the Shamir's gaze. The Shamir was said to have been either lost or \"had lost its potency\" (along with the \"dripping of the honeycomb\") by the time of the destruction of the First Temple at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C.\n\nAccording to the deutero-canonical Asmodeus legend, the shamir was given to Solomon as a gift from Asmodeus, the king of demons.\n\nAnother version of the story holds that a captured Asmodeus told Solomon the Shamir was entrusted to the care of a woodcock. Solomon then sends his trusted aide Benaiah on a quest to retrieve it.\n\nThe shamir worm was also used by King Solomon to engrave gemstones. Apparently he also used the blood of the shamir worm to make carved jewels with a mystical seal or design. According to an interview with Dr. George Frederick Kunz, an expert in gemstone and jewelry lore, this led to the belief that gemstones so engraved would have magical virtues, and they often also ended up with their own powers or guardian angel associated with either the gem, or the specifically engraved gemstones.\n\nThe Quran mentions the shamir when pointing out the ignorance of the jinn who worked for Solomon concerning the occult, and emphasizing that all knowledge rests only with God:\n\nAccording to commentators such as Ibn Abbas, when Solomon died his body remained leaning on his staff for a long time, nearly a year, until \"a creature of the earth, which was a kind of worm,\" gnawed through the stick weakening it and the body fell to the ground. It was then that the jinn knew that he had died a long time before and until then they were working hard thinking they were being supervised by him. It also became clear to humans who divined and engaged in occult activities or spirit-consulting, or worshiped the jinn that they do not possess knowledge of the occult.\n\nLeonard Tushnet's story \"\"The Worm Shamir,\"\" published in the December 1968 issue of Fantasy & Science Fiction, retells the legend in modern, quasi-scientific terms.\n"}

For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Avila Beach as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. The population was 1,627 at the 2010 census.\n\nThe name Avila commemorates Miguel Ávila, who was granted Rancho San Miguelito in 1842. The town was established in the latter half of the 19th century, when it served as the main shipping port for San Luis Obispo. Around this time, Luigi Marre built a honeymoon hotel here and steamboats brought customers from San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough Avila Beach still has a working commercial fishing pier and the inland areas have extensive apple orchards, tourism is now the main industry. There are few historical structures remaining; among the oldest is the Point San Luis Light, built in 1890 after a series of shipping accidents.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Unocal began the cleanup of decades old oil seepage discovered years earlier from corroding pipes under the township, and which had caused a massive oil spill under the town. Over 6,750 truckloads of contaminated material was sent to a Bakersfield landfill, and replaced with clean Guadalupe Dunes sand. Many of the town's homes and businesses, including several blocks of Front Street, were razed as a result of the quarter-mile-wide excavation. New buildings, homes, businesses, modern walkways and sea motif walls and benches have been constructed.\n\nThe beach is less than 0.5 miles (0.8 km) long and sheltered in San Luis Bay, which is formed by Point San Luis on the west and Fossil Point on the east. Avila Beach faces south and the 600 foot elevation of Point San Luis breaks the prevailing northwesterly winds. It is therefore usually warmer than the other beaches on the Central Coast. Most of Avila Beach is undeveloped, except for a few blocks adjacent to the beach with homes, hotels, and small businesses, and a few upscale housing developments inland near a golf course. Avila Beach is also known for its hot springs, which are used for resort spas.\n\nU.S. Route 101 and State Highway 1 bypass this part of the coastline to the east in favor of a more direct route from Pismo Beach north to San Luis Obispo.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 6.0 square miles (15.6 km), 99.71% of it land, and 0.29% of it water.\n\nAverage temperatures vary little during the year, ranging from to from November through April, and from to from May through October. Average annual rainfall is . Along with much of the California coast, winter is the wet season, with more than 70% of the yearly rain falling from December through March, while summer brings drought conditions.\n\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Avila Beach had a population of 1,627. The population density was 269.9 people per square mile (104.2/km). The racial makeup of Avila Beach was 1,507 (92.6%) White, 13 (0.8%) African American, 7 (0.4%) Native American, 33 (2.0%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 34 (2.1%) from other races, and 33 (2.0%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 111 persons (6.8%).\n\nThe Census reported that 1,627 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized.\n\nThere were 842 households, out of which 115 (13.7%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 416 (49.4%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 39 (4.6%) had a female householder with no husband present, 16 (1.9%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 36 (4.3%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 14 (1.7%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 296 households (35.2%) were made up of individuals and 108 (12.8%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.93. There were 471 families (55.9% of all households); the average family size was 2.45.\n\nThe population was spread out with 183 people (11.2%) under the age of 18, 74 people (4.5%) aged 18 to 24, 263 people (16.2%) aged 25 to 44, 597 people (36.7%) aged 45 to 64, and 510 people (31.3%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 56.9 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.0 males.\n\nThere were 1,093 housing units at an average density of 181.3 per square mile (70.0/km), of which 529 (62.8%) were owner-occupied, and 313 (37.2%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 3.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 7.4%. 1,074 people (66.0% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 553 people (34.0%) lived in rental housing units.\n\nAvila Beach has three piers: Avila Beach Pier, in length, is closed to tourist strolling and recreational fishing; Harford Pier, which is for commercial fishing boats to offload their wares since 1873; and the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly SLO) Pier, part of the university's marine research program, is not publicly accessible.\n\nIn recent years, the pier has become a site for whale watching as numbers of grays and humpback whales come into bays around the pier to feed and draw crowds during the seasons.\n\nDiablo Canyon Power Plant, the last remaining nuclear power plant in California, is located in a remote part of the Avila Beach unincorporated area, about northwest of the beach itself.\n\nThe Avila Beach Pier was featured in a Super Bowl advertisement on February 7, 2010.\n\nAvila Beach was the primary shooting location for the 1979 film \"California Dreaming\", which starred Dennis Christopher, Glynnis O'Connor, and Seymour Cassel.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1964121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964121", "title": "Calculator input methods", "text": "Calculator input methods\n\nThere are various ways in which calculators interpret keystrokes. These can be categorized into two main types:\n\n\nThe immediate execution mode of operation (also known as single-step, algebraic entry system (AES) or chain calculation mode) is commonly employed on most general-purpose calculators. In most simple four-function calculators, such as the Windows calculator in Standard mode and those included with most early operating systems, each binary operation is executed as soon as the next operator is pressed, and therefore the order of operations in a mathematical expression is not taken into account. Scientific calculators, including the Scientific mode in the Windows calculator and most modern software calculators, have buttons for brackets and \"can\" take order of operation into account. Also, for unary operations, like √ or \"x\", the number is entered first, then the operator; this is largely because the display screens on these kinds of calculators are generally composed entirely of seven-segment characters and thus capable of displaying only numbers, not the functions associated with them. This mode of operation also makes it impossible to change the expression being input without clearing the display entirely.\n\nThe first and second example have been given twice. The first version is for simple calculators, showing how it is necessary to rearrange operands in order to get the correct result. The second version is for scientific calculators, where operator precedence is observed.\n\nImmediate-execution calculators are based on a mixture of infix and postfix notation: binary operations are done as infix, but unary operations are postfix. Because operators are applied one-at-a-time, the user must work out which operator key to use at each stage, and this can lead to problems. When discussing these problems, Professor Harold Thimbleby has pointed out that button-operated calculators \"require numbers and operation signs to be punched in a certain order, and mistakes are easy to make and hard to spot\".\n\nProblems can occur because, for anything but the simplest calculation, in order to work out the value of a written formula, the user of a button-operated calculator is required to:\n\nMistakes can be hard to spot because:\n\nThe simplest example given by Professor Thimbleby of a possible problem when using an immediate-execution calculator is 4 × (−5). As a written formula the value of this is −20 because the minus sign is intended to indicate a negative number, rather than a subtraction, and this is the way that it would be interpreted by a formula calculator.\n\nOn an immediate-execution calculator, depending on which keys are used and the order in which they are pressed, the result for this calculation may be different. Also there are differences between calculators in the way a given sequence of button presses is interpreted. The result can be:\n\nThe effects of operator precedence, parentheses and non-commutative operators, on the sequence of button presses, are illustrated by:\n\nThese are only simple examples, but immediate-execution calculators can present even greater problems in more complex cases. In fact, Professor Thimbleby claims that users may have been conditioned to avoid them for all but the simplest calculations.\n\nThe potential problems with immediate-execution calculators stem from the fact that they are imperative. This means that the user must provide details of \"how\" the calculation has to be performed.\n\nProfessor Thimbleby has identified the need for a calculator that is more automatic and therefore easier to use, and he states that such a calculator should be more declarative. This means that the user should be able to specify only \"what\" has to be done, not how, and in which order, it has to be done.\n\nFormula calculators are more declarative because the typed-in formula specifies what is to be done, and the user does not have to provide any details of the step-by-step order in which the calculation has to be performed.\n\nDeclarative solutions are easier to understand than imperative solutions, and there has been a long-term trend from imperative to declarative methods. Formula calculators are part of this trend.\n\nMany software tools for the general user, such as spreadsheets, are declarative. Formula calculators are examples of such tools.\n\nSoftware calculators that simulate hand-held, immediate execution calculators do not use the full power of the computer: \"A computer is a far more powerful device than a hand-held calculator, and thus it is illogical and limiting to duplicate hand-held calculators on a computer.\" (Haxial Software Pty Ltd) Formula calculators use more of the computer's power because, besides calculating the value of a formula, they work out the order in which things should be done.\n\nInfix notation is a method where unary operations are input into the calculator in the same order as they are written on paper. Different forms of this input scheme exist. In the algebraic entry system with hierarchy (AESH), the precedence of basic mathematical operators is taken into account, whereas calculators with algebraic entry system with parentheses (AESP) support the entry of parentheses. An input scheme known as algebraic operating system (AOS) combines both.\n\nCalculators that use infix notation tend to incorporate a dot-matrix display to display the expression being entered, frequently accompanied by a seven-segment display for the result of the expression. Because the expression is not evaluated until it is fully entered, there is provision for editing the entered expression at any point prior to evaluation, as well as replaying entered expressions and their answers from memory.\n\nMost graphing calculators by Casio and Texas Instruments use this method. On its scientific calculators, Sharp calls this method Direct Algebraic Logic (D.A.L.), and Casio calls this method the Visually Perfect Algebraic Method (V.P.A.M.).\n\nIn reverse Polish notation, also known as postfix notation, all operations are entered after the operands on which the operation is performed. Reverse Polish notation is parenthesis-free, which usually leads to fewer button presses needed to perform an operation. By the use of a stack, one can enter formulas without the need to rearrange operands.\n\nHewlett-Packard's calculators are well-known examples among calculators which use RPN. Early models, such as the HP-35, used RPN entirely without any alternative methods. Later models, such as the HP 35s, also had infix notation and could conveniently allow users to switch between it and RPN.\n\nNote: The first example illustrates one of the few cases where reverse Polish notation does not use the fewest button presses – provided one does not rearrange operands. If one would do so then only six keystrokes would be needed.\n\nBASIC notation is a particular implementation of infix notation where functions require their parameters to be in brackets.\n\nThis method was used from the 1980s to the 1990s in BASIC programmable calculators and pocket computers. Texas Instruments would later implement the method in many of its graphing calculators, including the TI-83 and TI-84 Plus series. Most computer algebra systems also use this as the default input method.\n\nIn BASIC notation, the formula is entered as it would be entered in BASIC, using the codice_1 command – the codice_1 command itself being optional. On pressing \"ENTER\" or \"=\", the result would be displayed. As with standard infix notation, typing mistakes in the entered formula could be corrected using the same editor function as the one used when programming the calculator.\n\nFor the second example, two options are given depending on if the BASIC programmable pocket computers have dedicated trigonometric keys or not.\n\nThe ten-key notation input method first became popular with accountants' paper tape adding machines. It generally makes the assumption that entered numbers are being summed, although other operations are supported. Each number entered is followed by its sign (+/−), and a running total is kept. An assumption is made that the last operand can be implicitly used next, so by just entering another + (for example), one will reuse the most recent operand. Ten key input mode is available in printing calculators from companies such as Sharp, and in software calculators like Judy's TenKey used by accounting firms. Online tenkey training and certification tools are available as well, and some businesses use ten key typing speed as an employment criterion.\n\nModern computer algebra systems, as well as many scientific and graphing calculators, allow for \"pretty-printing\", that is, entry of equations such that fractions, surds and integrals, etc. are displayed in the way they would normally be written. Such calculators are generally similar in appearance to those using infix notation, but feature a full dot-matrix display and templates for entering expressions, which are navigated using arrow keys on the calculator. The templates contain spaces for values or expressions to be entered, and empty values would typically result in a syntax error, making it more cumbersome to navigate than standard infix notation; standard infix notation is often an option on such calculators as well.\n\nCasio used to call this feature \"Natural Display\" or \"Natural textbook display\", but now uses \"Natural-VPAM\". Sharp calls this \"WriteView\" on its scientific calculators and simply \"Equation Editor\" on its graphing calculators. HP calls this its \"Textbook\" display setting, which can be used in both RPN and Algebraic mode and in both the \"Stack\" and in the \"Equation Writer\" application. Mathematica calls this \"Semantic-Faithful Typesetting\". Mathcad calls this \"standard math notation\". Maple has a \"Math Equation Editor\", but does not have a special name for this input method. Texas Instruments calls it \"MathPrint,\" incorporating it in its high-end calculators, such as the TI-Nspire series, and in 2011 added the feature to its TI-84 series with the 2.55 OS update.\nFor the second example, two options are given, depending on whether the calculators will automatically insert needed parentheses or not. Machines equipped with an alphanumeric display will display SIN(30)×COS(30) before is pressed.\n\n"}

Previously the school was known as Audenshaw Grammar School and Audenshaw School. Audenshaw Grammar school opened to boys in 1932.\n\nOn 29 July 1932, Audenshaw Grammar School for Boys was opened, providing facilities for 300 pupils. \"The school officially opened on Saturday July 23rd at 3.00 pm when the contractors handed the keys to County Alderman J. T. Travis Clegg DL JP. The school remained open until 7:00 pm for inspection by the general public. On 13 September 1932, seventy-six boys walked through the gates of a brand new Grammar School on Hazel Street Audenshaw.\"\n\nThe first Head Master was John Lord, who was in charge until 1953. He was followed by Ronald Porter, who had joined the school from Stretford Grammar School. Kenneth Exley became Headmaster in 1961, having previously been Headmaster at the Creighton School for Boys in Carlisle.\n\nIn 1981, Graham Locke OBE succeeded Exley as Head Master. Locke was Head Master until his sudden death in 1994; the school's sports hall is named in his memory. Locke was later appointed to the Order of the British Empire for his role for services to education.\n\nAlan Crompton was Head Master from 1994 to 2005, whereupon he retired. Crompton had previously worked at Copley High School in Stalybridge. He was widely regarded as one of the most outstanding Head Masters of his generation. When Crompton retired he was succeeded by Stephen Turner, who joined the school having been Head at Golborne High School in Wigan – he retired in 2012. The current Head is Jeanette Saw was appointed in June 2013.\nIn 1989, Audenshaw became one of the first Grant Maintained (GM) schools in England under the leadership of Locke and the then Chair of Governors T. Hall. The school had faced the threat of a merger and then closure. The LEA attempted to sell the school land but a High Court ruling overturned this action. The school opted out of LEA control in 1988; parents voted for the maintenance – 86% of those eligible voted; 91% of them voting in favour of the school receiving grant maintenance. This followed the Parents Action Group campaign. Since then the school has grown and has become one of the most popular schools in Tameside. Mr T Hall was awarded the MBE for services to Education and he remains the Chair of Governors.\n\nIn the mid-1960s pupils of Audenshaw Grammar School formed a branch of the Peak Forest Canal Restoration Society. Founding members W. Lear, N. Markham, and W. Morgan began their efforts in the summer of 1965 with the objective of cleaning, restoring and reopening the then derelict Ashton Canal. Successful in their ambitious aim, the canal was eventually reopened on 13 May 1974 by Denis Howel, then Member of Parliament for Birmingham Small Heath and the Minister for Sport.\n\nAudenshaw Grammar School lost its sixth form in the late 1970s due to ‘reorganisation’ within the LEA. However, an adjoining sixth form college was opened in 1997, the same year the school was granted foundation school status but this time it was co-educational rather than single-sex, gaining fairly mixed results. The school also became fully comprehensive in the late 1970s. The sixth form was announced to close in June 2018. It will officially close in June 2019 after the final year has taken their exams.\n\nIn 1999, Audenshaw School won the inaugural – and only – schools' series of Channel 4's daytime quiz show \"Fifteen to One\".\n\nThe Queen Mother visited the school in 1959 to present colours to the Manchester Regiment. In 2007, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary with a visit by the Princess Royal who officially opened the Sixth Form extension.\n\nIn 2019 Audenshaw School’s sixth form closed due to its small size, and thus not securing enough funding after government cuts, making it economically unviable for the school as a whole. \n\nWorld War II\n\nA number of old boys and a master were killed during active service during World War II.

They played two seasons, 1974 and 1975. Their records were 9–11 in 1974 and 4–7–1 in 1975. Their home stadium was Honolulu Stadium in 1974 and Aloha Stadium in 1975. The best known player to play for the Hawaiians was former Dallas Cowboys running back Calvin Hill, though quarterback Jim Fassel became better known as a head coach decades later. The Hawaiians head coach was Michael Giddings who guided the Hawaiians through both the 1974 and 1975 World Football League seasons.\n\nThe franchise was originally going to be called the Honolulu Warriors, but a local team had trademarked that name. As a result, the team was known simply as \"The Hawaiians\", although the press frequently mistakenly called them the \"Honolulu Hawaiians\" or the \"Hawaii Hawaiians.\" They were owned by real estate developer Christopher Hemmeter for the first season. He was named league president in 1975, and sold the Hawaiians to jewel merchant Edward Sultan, Jr.\n\nTo keep the NFL out of Hawaii, the WFL had the Hawaiians play their games on Sundays, while the rest of the league played (mostly) on Wednesday nights. This resulted in confusion, since one team played a different schedule from the rest of the league, and teams had to fly back to the mainland Sunday night to play again on Wednesday night. The franchise also made the mistake of allowing a same-day tape delay of their home games, meaning many Hawaiians' fans would watch the game on TV later on that day. (As a result, the Hawaiians drew just 13,031 fans per game, ahead of only New York and Detroit, neither of which finished the season.) Eventually, the Hawaiians switched to playing on Wednesday nights.\n\nEven with these missteps, the Hawaiians represented a serious attempt to form a viable professional football organization, one that at least had the potential for success had the WFL been better run. They were one of only three teams that did not miss a payroll during the league's first season. (False accounts had said some players released from the team could not afford to get to the mainland.) Hemmeter and his original partner, Sam Battisone (who also owned the NBA's New Orleans Jazz) were among the few owners thought to be capable of fielding a team in 1975.\n\nIt was the first and, to date, only major professional American football team to establish its home base outside the contiguous 48 states. (This excludes the Pro Bowl teams, which have called Hawaii home from 1980 to 2009 and again in 2011, 2012 and 2016.)\n\n\n"}

When the World Football League was created in October 1973, the Storm was the original New York franchise. When the Boston Bulls merged with New York to become the New York Stars, the original New York entry's draft picks were eventually relegated to Portland. They were the first major league football team based in Portland. They played at Civic Stadium, now known as Providence Park.\n\nPortland's original owner, Houston accountant John Rooney, soon dropped out of the picture. By March 1974, Bruce Gelker, a former football player and owner of several Saddleback Inns, was named the new owner of the fledgling team. Gelker originally sought a team in Mexico City, which proved to be unfeasible. After approaching officials in Salt Lake City, he settled on Portland. The Storm hired Ron Mix, a Pro Football Hall of Famer, as general manager and Dick Coury, an NFL assistant with the Denver Broncos, as head coach. Before the season, Canadian businessman Robert Harris bought a controlling interest, but Gelker stayed on as team president.\n\nThe Storm was the last WFL team to be organized, and as a result had mostly rookies on their roster. Among the standouts was running back Rufus \"Roadrunner\" Ferguson, ex-CFL and Detroit Lion quarterback Greg Barton, and linebackers coach Marty Schottenheimer (later a successful head coach in the NFL) and Bruce Bergey, brother of Cincinnati Bengals-Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Bill Bergey.\n\nIn the first half of the season Portland played poorly, going 2-7-1. The Storm won their first game when they beat Detroit in the ninth week. Originally a Wheels home game, the contest was moved to London, Ontario. The team improved during the second half of the season, thanks in part to several NFL players cut during training camp that September. Among the new signings were Ben Davidson of the Oakland Raiders, and Pete Beathard, who had been cut by the Kansas City Chiefs. With the stock of veterans, the Storm won six of their final 10 games. One of those wins was a 26-21 upset of the powerful Birmingham Americans.\n\nThe team was in trouble off the field as well. They only drew 14,000 fans per game. Additionally, an onerous lease with Civic Stadium rapidly drained the team of cash. By the middle of the season, Harris was so short on cash that he persuaded the Detroit Wheels to move their game to his hometown of London, Ontario. The players went the last few games without being paid, and reportedly they had to depend on sympathetic fans for food. They were forced to move their final home game, against the Florida Blazers, to the road due to the poor attendance, and only played after Harris guaranteed them $50,000. The money never arrived.\n\nThe team finished the season with an overall record of 7-12-1, tied with Houston-Shreveport for 8th place in the 12-team league and seemingly qualifying them for the playoffs. However, league officials decided to reduce the playoff field to six teams—without telling anyone with the Storm. Soon after, the IRS slapped a $168,000 lien on the franchise.\n\nThe Portland Thunder took the Storm's place in 1975 and lasted until the entire WFL folded halfway through their second season. The Thunder's office in downtown closed in October 1975.\n\nIn 2013, the Arena Football League expanded into Portland, as the Portland Thunder, making many recall the Storm/Thunder.\n\n\n"}

A finalist for the National Book Award and considered one of the best literary ghost stories published during the 20th century, it has been made into two feature films and a play, and is the basis of a Netflix series. Jackson's novel relies on terror rather than horror to elicit emotion in the reader, using complex relationships between the mysterious events in the house and the characters’ psyches.\n\nThe author decided to write \"a ghost story\" after reading about a group of nineteenth century \"psychic researchers\" who studied a house and somberly reported their supposedly scientific findings to the Society for Psychic Research. What Jackson discovered in their \"dry reports was not the story of a haunted house, it was the story of several earnest, I believe misguided, certainly determined people, with their differing motivations and background.\" Excited by the prospect of creating her own haunted house and the characters to explore it, she launched into research. She later claimed to have found a picture of a California house she believed was suitably haunted-looking in a magazine. She asked her mother, who lived in California, to help find information about the dwelling. According to Jackson, her mother identified the house as one the author's own great-great-grandfather, an architect who had designed some of San Francisco's oldest buildings, had built. Jackson also read volume upon volume of traditional ghost stories while preparing to write her own, \"No one can get into a novel about a haunted house without hitting the subject of reality head-on; either I have to believe in ghosts, which I do, or I have to write another kind of novel altogether.\"<br>- Paula Guran\n\nJackson sketched floor plans of downstairs and upstairs of Hill House and a rendering of the exterior.\n\nHill House is a mansion in a location that is never specified but is between many hills. The story concerns four main characters: Dr. John Montague, an investigator of the supernatural; Eleanor Vance, a shy young woman who resents having lived as a recluse caring for her demanding disabled mother; Theodora, a flamboyant, bohemian artist; and Luke Sanderson, the young heir to Hill House, who is host to the others.\n\nDr. Montague hopes to find scientific evidence of the existence of the supernatural. He rents Hill House for a summer and invites as his guests several people whom he has chosen because of their experiences with paranormal events. Of these, only Eleanor and Theodora accept. Eleanor travels to the house, where she and Theodora will live in isolation with Montague and Luke.\n\nHill House has two caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, who refuse to stay near the house at night. The blunt and single-minded Mrs. Dudley is a source of some comic relief. The four overnight visitors begin to form friendships as Dr. Montague explains the building's history, which encompasses suicide and other violent deaths.\n\nAll four of the inhabitants begin to experience strange events while in the house, including unseen noises and ghosts roaming the halls at night, strange writing on the walls, and other unexplained events. Eleanor tends to experience phenomena to which the others are oblivious. At the same time, Eleanor may be losing touch with reality, and the narrative implies that at least some of what Eleanor witnesses may be products of her imagination. Another implied possibility is that Eleanor possesses a subconscious telekinetic ability that is itself the cause of many of the disturbances experienced by her and other members of the investigative team (which might indicate there is no ghost in the house at all). This possibility is suggested especially by references early in the novel to Eleanor's childhood memories about episodes of a poltergeist-like entity that seemed to involve mainly her.\n\nLater in the novel, the bossy and arrogant Mrs. Montague and her companion Arthur Parker, the headmaster of a boys’ school, arrive to spend a weekend at Hill House and to help investigate it. They, too, are interested in the supernatural, including séances and spirit writing. Unlike the other four characters, they do not experience anything supernatural, although some of Mrs. Montague's alleged spirit writings seem to communicate with Eleanor. Mrs. Montague's haughtiness and self-importance provide another source of comic relief.\n\nMuch of the supernatural phenomena that occur are described only vaguely, or else are partly hidden from the characters themselves. Eleanor and Theodora are in a bedroom with an unseen force trying the door, and Eleanor believes after the fact that the hand she was holding in the darkness was not Theodora's. In one episode, as Theodora and Eleanor walk outside Hill House at night, they see a ghostly family picnic that seems to be taking place in daylight. Theodora screams in fear for Eleanor to run, warning her not to look back, though the book never explains what Theodora sees. \n\nBy this point in the book, it is becoming clear to the characters that the house is beginning to possess Eleanor. Fearing for her safety, Dr. Montague and Luke declare that she must leave. Eleanor, however, regards the house as her home and resists. Dr. Montague and Luke force her into her car; she bids them farewell and drives off, but before leaving the property grounds she propels the car into a large oak tree, and it is assumed that she is killed. In the short, final paragraph that follows, the reader is left uncertain whether Eleanor was simply an emotionally disturbed woman who committed suicide, or whether her death at Hill House has a supernatural significance. She is revealed to have died in the same spot where the original owner also perished.\n\nIn a \"New York Times\" review in 1959, Edmund Fuller wrote, \"With her 'conceit' of Hill House, whether pretty be the name for it or not, Shirley Jackson proves again that she is the finest master currently practicing in the genre of the cryptic, haunted tale.\"\n\nStephen King, in his book \"Danse Macabre\" (1981), a non-fiction review of the horror genre, lists \"The Haunting of Hill House\" as one of the finest horror novels of the late 20th century and provides a lengthy review. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", the book is \"now widely regarded as the greatest haunted-house story ever written.\"\nIn his review column for \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\", Damon Knight selected the novel as one of the 10 best genre books of 1959, declaring it \"in a class by itself.\"\n\nReappraising the book in \"The Guardian\" in 2010, Sophie Missing wrote, \"Jackson treats her material – which could be reduced to penny dreadful stuff in less deft hands – with great skill and subtlety. […] The horror inherent in the novel does not lie in Hill House (monstrous though it is) or the events that take place within it, but in the unexplored recesses of its characters' – and its readers' – minds. This is perhaps why it remains the definitive haunted house story\". \n\nIn 2018, \"The New York Times\" polled 13 writers to choose the scariest book of fiction they have ever read, and Carmen Maria Machado and Neil Gaiman both chose \"The Haunting of Hill House\".\n\nCarmen Maria Machado wrote in \"The Atlantic\" about her experience discovering \"The Haunting of Hill House\". She was at a writer's retreat while working on her short story \"The Resident,\" and was told her story reminded readers of Shirley Jackson. Having read little of Jackson, Machado decided to read \"Hill House\": \"When I went back home to Philly, I picked up a copy. And I just devoured it. I read it in one sitting. I started reading one night, and when my girlfriend (now wife) went to bed I just kept reading. It scared the shit out of me. Even though the events that appear to be supernatural activity are few and far between, those scenes are so chillingly written—as if Jackson was describing a phenomenon she’d seen before and really understood. The book’s particular brand of surreality felt, to me, like that experience of walking home from a party a little bit drunk, when the world somehow seems sharper and clearer and weirder.\"\n\nThe novel has been adapted to film twice, in 1963 and again in 1999, both times under the title \"The Haunting.\" The 1963 version is a relatively faithful adaptation and received critical praise. The 1999 version, considerably different from the novel and widely panned by critics, is an overt fantasy horror in which all the main characters are terrorized and two are killed by explicitly supernatural deaths. It was also parodied in \"Scary Movie 2\" (2001).\n\nIt was first adapted for the stage in 1964 by F. Andrew Leslie. In 2015, Anthony Neilson prepared a new stage adaptation for Sonia Friedman and Hammer for production at the Liverpool Playhouse.\n\nIn 1997, \"The Haunting of Hill House\" was abridged for radio by Alison Joseph and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in eight 15-minute episodes, read by Emma Fielding.\n\nA loose television adaptation was released in 2018 to critical acclaim. It changed many elements from the novel, keeping mainly its Hill House setting, Mr and Mrs Dudley, and a few character names, but shifted the focus to members of a singular haunted \"Crain family.\" It was directed by Mike Flanagan and was produced for Netflix. Varying from the novel, the series depicted the married couple and their five children being terrorized by the house for decades of their lives.\n\n\n"}

The original music score was composed by Clifton Parker and the cinematography was by Geoffrey Unsworth.\n\nThe film tells the story of two young children shipwrecked on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. Emotional feelings and physical changes arise as they grow to maturity and fall in love.

One day a ship arrives carrying Doctor Murdoch and James Carter, two British men who, it is intimated, have fled as criminals from civilization. Surprised to find the couple on the island, Doctor Murdoch soon realizes that Michael collects valuable pearls without knowing their true worth. While Murdoch attempts to trick Michael into getting him a bounty of pearls, Carter tries to kidnap Emmeline and escape. Murdoch and Carter kill each other on the boat, and Michael and Emmeline vow to never attempt to leave the island again. They marry, and during a tropical storm a child, Paddy, is born.\n\nIn 1917, 3 years later, Emmeline is reminded of the outside world and decides she wants to leave the island. She fears for their child if she and Michael should die and begins to think of his future. Michael finally gives in to her pleading and they pack a small boat and leave the island. But becalmed in the middle of the ocean, they succumb to exposure. They are found by a British ship, but the film leaves their fate ambiguous, showing only that their child, Paddy, remains alive in the small boat.\n\nThe film was an adaptation of a novel which had been filmed in 1923.\n\nHerbert Wilcox bought the rights to the novel in 1935 and announced he would make it as part of a slate of films. It was going to be shot in color in Honolulu.\n\nHowever, he did not make the film and sold them to Gainsborough Pictures at the recommendation of Frank Launder, who always admired the novel. Gainsborough announced the film in 1938 as part of a slate of 10 films. The stars were to be Michael Redgrave and Margaret Lockwood who had just appeared in Gainsborough's \"The Lady Vanishes\"; Will Fyffe was to co-star. In 1939 it was announced Gainsborough would make the film as a co-production with 20th Century Fox and that Lockwood would co-star with Richard Greene, under contract to Fox. Plans to make the film were postponed due to the war.\n\nThe project was reactivated after the war and announced in 1947 with Frank Launder attached to direct. Extensive location searches were undertaken before deciding to make the movie in Fiji.\n\nPlans to make the film were postponed due to Britain's currency difficulties, but eventually plans were re-activated.\n\nThe evil traders were invented for this film and are not part of the novel.\n\nJean Simmons was attached to the project at an early stage off the back of her success in \"Great Expectations\" (1946).\n\nDonald Houston was selected as the male lead over 5,000 applicants, 100 of whom were screen-tested.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Fiji, Yasawa Islands, and at Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England.\n\nIn December, a light plane carrying Leslie Gilliat, the producer and brother of Sidney Gilliat crashed into a river near Suva. Both Gilliat and the pilot escaped unharmed.\n\nSimmons left England in November, spent some time in Australia and then travelled to Fiji. There was some doubt she would be let into Fiji, as she was only 18 and the Fijian colonial regime was contemplating a ban on people under 19 into the country as a precaution against polio being introduced.\n\nHuston and Simmons narrowly escaped injury in Fiji when their car overturned.\n\nThe bulk of filming in Fiji took place on the Yasawa Islands. Storms caused shooting to take three months.\n\n\"The Blue Lagoon\" was the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1949.\n\n\n\n"}

His first title was Mr Britain in 1946. He then won the Mr Universe in 1951, 1958 and 1965. He also starred in five films, four featured as Hercules, and in one, \"Hercules in the Haunted World\" (1961), he co-starred with Christopher Lee. Besides his own career and titles, he is probably best known as an idol and mentor to Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nRoy Park was born in Leeds, West Yorkshire on 7 June 1928 Showing athletic interests early in life, Park dedicated his teenage years to excelling in football where he played in the reserves for Leeds United. He had no specific interest in bodybuilding until age 16 when he met muscleman David Cohen. Upon learning that Cohen lifted weights at his friend's house, Park joined in out of curiosity. Park's legendary physique would begin to grow from barbells, dumbbells and a simple chinning bar.\n\nDuring his national service he was a Physical Training Instructor in Singapore. Upon discharge from the British Army in 1948, he witnessed his first physique contest; the inaugural NABBA Mr. Universe contest in London, in which John Grimek edged out Steve Reeves in controversial fashion. It was this contest that inspired Park to compete himself.\n\nAfter one year of hard training, Park earned the title of Mr. Britain in 1949. He then subsequently spent six months in the United States (thanks to a gift from his parents). There, he met up with publisher Joe Weider, who began to feature the Englishman prominently in his muscle magazines. The next year, Park was runner-up to Steve Reeves in the 1950 NABBA Amateur Mr. Universe in London (also a close contest).\n\nAfter a second full year of training, Park broke what had been an American monopoly on bodybuilding titles by winning the 1951 National Amateur Bodybuilders Association (NABBA) Amateur Mr. Universe. He cemented his status by winning the 1958 and 1965 NABBA Pro Mr. Universe titles. Standing 6'1\" and with a top weight of 250 pounds, Park was known for his muscular mass and was a forerunner to modern bodybuilding. Park was also renowned for his strength, which he often demonstrated in contests and strongman exhibitions. He is on record as the second man to bench press 500 lbs, after Doug Hepburn. As an actor, Park made five films—all Italian Hercules sword and sandal pictures.\n\nUp to the time of his illness in 2007, despite being in his seventies, Park continued to train clients at the Morningside Virgin Active Gym in Sandton, South Africa. He has been featured in many fitness and bodybuilding magazines, and has also appeared on the cover of \"Muscle & Fitness\". He was inducted into the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) IFBB Hall of Fame's first ballot in 1999.\n\nWith his wife of 55 years, Mareon, and children Jeunesse and Jon Jon by his side, Park died on 22 November 2007 in his home in South Africa, after an eight-month battle with metastatic melanoma (a form of skin cancer). Park's legacy is continued by his son Jon Jon Park, a personal trainer and former Olympic swimmer. Reg Park raised and trained Jon Jon in South Africa. Today Jon Jon Park is the owner of the Legacy Gym, a popular gymnasium in West Los Angeles. Reg's daughter, Jeunesse, founded Food & Trees for Africa, a non profit that changed thousands of lives and landscapes.\n\nFamous for his mass and strength, Reg Park was an early influence and lifelong mentor to champion bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger said that he was inspired to become a bodybuilder after seeing Park. For three years in the 1960s Schwarzenegger was trained by Wag Bennett in his gym in the East End of London, and it was there where he met his idol Reg Park. Bonus footage from the DVD release of the classic documentary film \"Pumping Iron\" (1977) features Park mentoring Schwarzenegger. Park can also be heard performing the Master of Ceremonies duties in the Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia contests featured in the film proper.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964288", "title": "Jahn–Teller effect", "text": "Jahn–Teller effect\n\nThe Jahn–Teller effect (JT effect or JTE) is an important mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in molecular and solid-state systems which has far-reaching consequences in different fields, and is responsible for a variety of phenomena in spectroscopy, stereochemistry, crystal chemistry, molecular and solid-state physics, and materials science. The effect is named for Hermann Arthur Jahn and Edward Teller, who first reported studies about it in 1937.\n\nThe Jahn–Teller effect, sometimes also referred to as Jahn–Teller distortion, describes the geometrical distortion of molecules and ions that result from certain electron configurations. The Jahn–Teller theorem essentially states that any non-linear molecule with a spatially degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy, because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the species. For a description of another type of geometrical distortion that occurs in crystals with substitutional impurities see article off-center ions.\n\nThe Jahn–Teller effect is most often encountered in octahedral complexes of the transition metals. The phenomenon is very common in six-coordinate copper(II) complexes. The \"d\" electronic configuration of this ion gives three electrons in the two degenerate \"e\" orbitals, leading to a doubly degenerate electronic ground state. Such complexes distort along one of the molecular fourfold axes (always labelled the \"z\" axis), which has the effect of removing the orbital and electronic degeneracies and lowering the overall energy. The distortion normally takes the form of elongating the bonds to the ligands lying along the \"z\" axis, but occasionally occurs as a shortening of these bonds instead (the Jahn–Teller theorem does not predict the direction of the distortion, only the presence of an unstable geometry). When such an elongation occurs, the effect is to lower the electrostatic repulsion between the electron-pair on the Lewis basic ligand and any electrons in orbitals with a \"z\" component, thus lowering the energy of the complex. The inversion centre is preserved after the distortion.\n\nIn octahedral complexes, the Jahn–Teller effect is most pronounced when an odd number of electrons occupy the \"e\" orbitals. This situation arises in complexes with the configurations \"d\", low-spin \"d\" or high-spin \"d\" complexes, all of which have doubly degenerate ground states. In such compounds the \"e\" orbitals involved in the degeneracy point directly at the ligands, so distortion can result in a large energetic stabilisation. Strictly speaking, the effect also occurs when there is a degeneracy due to the electrons in the \"t\" orbitals (\"i.e.\" configurations such as \"d\" or \"d\", both of which are triply degenerate). In such cases, however, the effect is much less noticeable, because there is a much smaller lowering of repulsion on taking ligands further away from the \"t\" orbitals, which do not point \"directly\" at the ligands (see the table below). The same is true in tetrahedral complexes (e.g. manganate: distortion is very subtle because there is less stabilisation to be gained because the ligands are not pointing directly at the orbitals.\n\nThe expected effects for octahedral coordination are given in the following table:\nw: weak Jahn–Teller effect (\"t\" orbitals unevenly occupied)\n\ns: strong Jahn–Teller effect expected (\"e\" orbitals unevenly occupied)\n\nblank: no Jahn–Teller effect expected.\n\nThe Jahn–Teller effect is manifested in the UV-VIS absorbance spectra of some compounds, where it often causes splitting of bands. It is readily apparent in the structures of many copper(II) complexes. Additional, detailed information about the anisotropy of such complexes and the nature of the ligand binding can be however obtained from the fine structure of the low-temperature electron spin resonance spectra.\n\nThe underlying cause of the Jahn–Teller effect is the presence of molecular orbitals that are both degenerate and open shell (i.e., incompletely occupied). This situation is not unique to coordination complexes and can be encountered in other areas of chemistry. In organic chemistry the phenomenon of antiaromaticity has the same cause and also often sees molecules distorting; as in the case of cyclobutadiene and cyclooctatetraene (COT).\n\nThe JT theorem can be stated in different forms, two of which are given here:\n\nAlternatively and considerably shorter:\n\nSpin-degeneracy was an exception in the original treatment and was later treated separately.\n\nThe formal mathematical proof of the Jahn–Teller theorem rests heavily on symmetry arguments, more specifically the theory of molecular point groups. The argument of Jahn and Teller assumes no details about the electronic structure of the system. Jahn and Teller made no statement about the strength of the effect, which may be so small that it is immeasurable. Indeed, for electrons in non-bonding or weakly bonding molecular orbitals, the effect is expected to be weak. However, in many situations the JT effect is important.\n\nInterest in the JTE increased after its first experimental verification. Various model systems were developed probing the degree of degeneracy and the type of symmetry. These were solved partly analytically and partly numerically to obtain the shape of the pertinent potential energy surfaces (PES) and the energy levels for the nuclear motion on the JT-split PES. These energy levels are not vibrational energy levels in the traditional sense because of the intricate coupling to the electronic motion that occurs, and are better termed vibronic energy levels. The new field of ‘vibronic coupling’ or ‘vibronic coupling theory’ was born.\n\nA further breakthrough occurred upon the advent of modern (\"ab initio\") electronic structure calculations whereby the relevant parameters characterising JT systems can be reliably determined from first principles. Thus one could go beyond studies of model systems that explore the effect of parameter variations on the PES and vibronic energy levels; one could also go on beyond fitting these parameters to experimental data without clear knowledge about the significance of the fit. Instead, well-founded theoretical investigations became possible which greatly improved the insight into the phenomena at hand and into the details of the underlying mechanisms.\nWhile recognizing the JTE distortion as a concrete example of the general spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism, the exact degeneracy of the involved electronic state was identified as a non-essential ingredient for this symmetry breaking in polyatomic systems. Even systems that in the undistorted symmetric configuration present electronic states which are near in energy but not precisely degenerate, can show a similar tendency to distort. The distortions of these systems can be treated within the related theory of the pseudo Jahn–Teller effect (in the literature often referred to as \"second-order JTE\"). This mechanism is associated to the vibronic couplings between adiabatic PES separated by nonzero energy gaps across the configuration space: its inclusion extends the applicability of JT-related models to symmetry breaking in a far broader range of molecular and solid-state systems.\n\n\"Chronology:\"\n\n\n\nA given JT problem will have a particular point group symmetry, such as T symmetry for magnetic impurity ions in semiconductors or I symmetry for the fullerene C. JT problems are conventionally classified using labels for the irreducible representations (irreps) that apply to the symmetry of the electronic and vibrational states. For example, E ⊗ e would refer to an electronic doublet state transforming as E coupled to a vibrational doublet state transforming as e.\n\nIn general, a vibrational mode transforming as Λ will couple to an electronic state transforming as Γ if the symmetric part of the Kronecker product [Γ ⊗ Γ] contains Λ, unless Γ is a double group representation when the antisymmetric part {Γ ⊗ Γ} is considered instead. Modes which do couple are said to be JT-active.\n\nAs an example, consider a doublet electronic state E in cubic symmetry. The symmetric part of E ⊗ E is A + E. Therefore, the state E will couple to vibrational modes formula_1 transforming as a and e. However, the a modes will result in the same energy shift to all states and therefore do not contribute to any JT splitting. They can therefore be neglected. The result is an E ⊗ e JT effect. This JT effect is experienced by triangular molecules X, tetrahedral molecules ML, and octahedral molecules ML when their electronic state has E symmetry.\n\nComponents of a given vibrational mode are also labelled according to their transformation properties. For example, the two components of an e mode are usually labelled formula_2 and formula_3, which in octahedral symmetry transform as formula_4 and formula_5 respectively.\n\nEigenvalues of the Hamiltonian of a polyatomic system define PESs as functions of normal modes formula_1 of the system (i.e. linear combinations of the nuclear displacements with specific symmetry properties). At the reference point of high symmetry, where the symmetry-induced degeneracy occurs, several of the eigenvalues coincide. By a detailed and laborious analysis, Jahn and Teller showed that – excepting linear molecules – there are always first-order terms in an expansion of the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetry-lowering (in the language of group theory: non-totally symmetric) normal modes. These linear terms represent forces that distort the system along these coordinates and lift the degeneracy. The point of degeneracy can thus not be stationary, and the system distorts toward a stationary point of lower symmetry where stability can be attained.\n\nProof of the JT theorem follows from the theory of molecular symmetry (point group theory). A less rigorous but more intuitive explanation is given in section .\n\nTo arrive at a quantitative description of the JT effect, the forces appearing between the component wave functions are described by expanding the Hamiltonian in a power series in the formula_1. Owing to the very nature of the degeneracy, the Hamiltonian takes the form of a matrix referring to the degenerate wave function components. A matrix element between states formula_8 and formula_9 generally reads as:\n\nThe expansion can be truncated after terms linear in the formula_1, or extended to include terms quadratic (or higher) in the formula_1.\n\nThe adiabatic potential energy surfaces (APES) are then obtained as the eigenvalues of this matrix. In the original paper it is proven that there are always linear terms in the expansion. It follows that the degeneracy of the wave function cannot correspond to a stable structure.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the APESs characterising the JT distortion arise as the eigenvalues of the potential energy matrix. Generally, the APESs take the characteristic appearance of a double cone, circular or elliptic, where the point of contact, i.e. degeneracy, denotes the high-symmetry configuration for which the JT theorem applies. For the above case of the linear E ⊗ e JT effect the situation is illustrated by the APES\n\ndisplayed in the figure, with part cut away to reveal its shape, which is known as a Mexican Hat potential. Here, formula_14 is the frequency of the vibrational e mode, formula_15 is its mass and formula_16 is a measure of the strength of the JT coupling. \n\nThe conical shape near the degeneracy at the origin makes it immediately clear that this point cannot be stationary, that is, the system is unstable against asymmetric distortions, which leads to a symmetry lowering. In this particular case there are infinitely many isoenergetic JT distortions. The formula_1 giving these distortions are arranged in a circle, as shown by the red curve in the figure. Quadratic coupling or cubic elastic terms lead to a warping along this \"minimum energy path\", replacing this infinite manifold by three equivalent potential minima and three equivalent saddle points. In other JT systems, linear coupling results in discrete minima.\n\nThe high symmetry of the double-cone topology of the linear E ⊗ e JT system directly reflects the high underlying symmetry. It is one of the earliest (if not the earliest) examples in the literature of a conical intersection of potential energy surfaces. Conical intersections have received wide attention in the literature starting in the 1990s and are now considered paradigms of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, with far-reaching consequences in molecular spectroscopy, photochemistry and photophysics. Some of these will be commented upon further below. In general, conical intersections are far less symmetric than depicted in the figure. They can be tilted and elliptical in shape etc., and also peaked and sloped intersections have been distinguished in the literature. Furthermore, for more than two degrees of freedom, they are not point-like structures but instead they are seams and complicated, curved hypersurfaces, also known as intersection space. The coordinate sub-space displayed in the figure is also known as a branching plane.\n\nThe characteristic shape of the JT-split APES has specific consequences for the nuclear dynamics, here considered in the fully quantum sense. For sufficiently strong JT coupling, the minimum points are sufficiently far (at least by a few vibrational energy quanta) below the JT intersection. Two different energy regimes are then to be distinguished, those of low and high energy.\n\n\n\nAs already stated above, the distinction of low and high energy regimes is valid only for sufficiently strong JT couplings, that is, when several or many vibrational energy quanta fit into the energy window between the conical intersection and the minimum of the lower JT-split APES. For the many cases of small to intermediate JT couplings this energy window and the corresponding adiabatic low-energy regime does not exist. Rather, the levels on both JT-split APES are intricately mixed for all energies and the nuclear motion always proceeds on both JT split APES simultaneously.\n\nIn 1965, Frank Ham proposed that the dynamic JTE could reduce the expected values of observables associated with the orbital wavefunctions due to the superposition of several electronic states in the total vibronic wavefunction. This effect leads, for example, to a partial quenching of the spin-orbit interaction and allowed the results of previous Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments to be explained.\n\nIn general, the result of an orbital operator acting on vibronic states can be replaced by an effective orbital operator acting on purely electronic states. In first order, the effective orbital operator equals the actual orbital operator multiplied by a constant, whose value is less than one, known as a first-order (Ham) reduction factor. For example, within a triplet T electronic state, the spin-orbit coupling operator formula_18 can be replaced by formula_19, where formula_20 is a function of the strength of the JT coupling which varies from 1 in zero coupling to 0 in very strong coupling. Furthermore, when second-order perturbation corrections are included, additional terms are introduced involving additional numerical factors, known as second-order (Ham) reduction factors. These factors are zero when there is no JT coupling but can dominate over first-order terms in strong coupling, when the first-order effects have been significantly reduced.\nReduction factors are particularly useful for describing experimental results, such as EPR and optical spectra, of paramagnetic impurities in semiconducting, dielectric, diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic hosts.\n\nFor a long time, applications of JT theory consisted mainly in parameter studies (model studies) where the APES and dynamical properties of JT systems have been investigated as functions on the system parameters such as coupling constants etc. Fits of these parameters to experimental data were often doubtful and inconclusive. The situation changed in the 1980s when efficient ab initio methods were developed and computational resources became powerful enough to allow for a reliable determination of these parameters from first principles. Apart from wave function-based \ntechniques (which are sometimes considered genuinely ab initio in the literature) the advent of density functional theory (DFT) opened up new avenues to treat larger systems including solids. This allowed details of JT systems to be characterised and experimental findings to be reliably interpreted. It lies at the heart of most developments addressed in Section .\n\nTwo different strategies are conceivable and have been used in the literature. One can\n\n\nNaturally, the more accurate approach (2) may be limited to smaller systems, while the simpler approach (1) lends itself to studies of larger systems.\n\nThe JT distortion of small molecules (or molecular ions) is directly deduced from electronic structure calculations of their APES (through DFT and/or ab initio computations). These molecules / ions are often radicals, such as trimers of alkali atoms (Li and Na), that have unpaired spins and in particular in (but not restricted to) doublet states. Besides the JTE in E' and E\" states, also the between an E state and a nearby A state may play a role. The JT distortion reduces the symmetry from D to C (see figure), and it depends on the details of the interactions whether the isosceles triangle has an acute or an obtuse-angled (such as Na) minimum energy structure. Natural extensions are systems like NO and NH where a JT distortion has been documented in the literature for ground or excited electronic states. \nA somewhat special role is played by tetrahedral systems like CH and P. Here threefold degenerate electronic states and vibrational modes come into play. Nevertheless, also twofold degeneracies continue to be important.\n\nAmong larger systems, a focus in the literature has been on benzene and its radical cation, as well as on their halo (especially fluoro) derivatives. Already in the early 1980s, a wealth of information emerged from the detailed analysis of experimental emission spectra of 1,3,5- trifluoro- and hexafluoro (and chloro) benzene radical cations. For the parent benzene cation one has to rely on photoelectron spectra with comparatively lower resolution because this species does not fluoresce (see also Section on ). Rather detailed ab initio calculations have been carried out which \ndocument the JT stabilization energies for the various (four) JT active modes and also quantify the moderate barriers for the JT pseudorotation.\n\nFinally, a somewhat special role is played by systems with a fivefold symmetry axis like the cyclopentadienyl radical. Careful laser spectroscopic investigations have shed useful light on the JT interactions. In particular they reveal that the barrier to pseudorotation almost vanishes (the system is highly \"fluxional\") which can be attributed to the fact that the 2nd-order coupling terms vanish by symmetry and the leading higher-order terms are of 4th order.\n\nThe JTE is usually stronger where the electron density associated with the degenerate orbitals is more concentrated. This effect therefore plays a large role in determining the structure of transition metal complexes with active internal 3d orbitals. \n\nThe most iconic and prominent of the JT systems in coordination chemistry is probably the case of Cu(II) octahedral complexes. While in perfectly equivalent coordination, like a CuF complex associated to a Cu(II) impurity in a cubic crystal like KMgF, perfect octahedral (O) symmetry is expected. In fact a lower tetragonal symmetry is usually found experimentally. The origin of this JTE distortion it revealed by examining the electronic configuration of the undistorted complex. For an octahedral geometry, the five 3d orbitals partition into t and e orbitals (see diagram). These orbitals are occupied by nine electrons corresponding to the formula_21 electronic configuration of Cu(II). Thus, the t shell is filled, and the e shell contains 3 electrons. Overall the unpaired electron produces a E state, which is Jahn–Teller active. The third electron can occupy either of the orbitals comprising the e shell: the mainly formula_4 orbital or the mainly formula_5 orbital. If the electron occupies the mainly formula_4 level, which antibonding orbital the final geometry of the complex would be elongated as the axial ligands will be pushed away to reduce the global energy of the system. On the other hand, if the electron went into the mainly formula_5 antibonding orbital the complex would distort into a compressed geometry. Experimentally elongated geometries are overwhelmingly observed and this fact has been attributed both to metal-ligand anharmonic interactions and 3d-4s hybridisations. Given that all the directions containing a fourfold axis are equivalent the distortion is equally likely to happen in any of these orientations. From the electronic point of view this means that the formula_4 and formula_5 orbitals, that are degenerate and free to hybridise in the octahedral geometry, will mix to produce appropriate equivalent orbitals in each direction like formula_28 or formula_29.\n\nThe JTE is not just restricted to Cu(II) octahedral complexes. There are many other configurations, involving changes both in the initial structure and electronic configuration of the metal that yield degenerate states and, thus, JTE. However, the amount of distortion and stabilisation energy of the effect is strongly dependent on the particular case. In octahedral Cu(II), the JTE is particularly strong because\n\n\nIn other configurations involving π or δ bonding, like for example when the degenerate state is associated to the t orbitals of an octahedral configuration, the distortion and stabilisation energies are usually much smaller and the possibility of not observing the distortion due to dynamic JT effects is much higher. Similarly for rare-earth ions where covalency is very small, the distortions associated to the JTE are usually very weak.\n\nImportantly, the JTE is associated with strict degeneracy in the electronic subsystem and so it cannot appear in systems without this property. For example, the JTE is often associated to cases like quasi-octahedral CuXY complexes where the distances to X and Y ligands are clearly different. However, the intrinsic symmetry of these complexes is already tetragonal and no degenerate e orbital exists, having split into a (mainly formula_4) and b (mainly formula_5) orbitals due to the different electronic interactions with axial X ligands and equatorial Y ligands. In this and other similar cases some remaining vibronic effects related to the JTE are still present but are quenched with respect to the case with degeneracy due to the splitting of the orbitals.\n\nFrom spectra with rotational resolution, moments of inertia and hence bond lengths and angles can be determined \"directly\" (at least in principle). From less well-resolved spectra one can still determine important quantities like JT stabilization energies and energy barriers (e.g. to pseudorotation). However, in the whole spectral intensity distribution formula_32 of an electronic transition more information is encoded. It has been used to decide on the presence (or absence) of the geometric phase which is accumulated during the pseudorotational motion around the JT (or other type of) conical intersection. Prominent examples of either type are the ground (X) or an excited (B) state of Na. The Fourier transform of formula_32, the so-called autocorrelation function formula_34 reflects the motion of the wavepacket after an optical (= vertical) transition to the APES of the final electronic state. Typically it will move on the timescale of a vibrational period which is (for small molecules) of the order of 5-50 fs, i.e. ultrafast. Besides a nearly periodic motion, mode-mode interactions with very irregular (also chaotic) behaviour and spreading of the wavepacket may also occur. Near a conical intersection this will be accompanied/complemented by nonradiative transitions (termed internal conversion) to other APESs occurring on the same ultrafast time scale.\n\nFor the JT case the situation is somewhat special, as compared to a general conical intersection, because the different JT potential sheets are symmetry-related to each other and have (exactly or nearly) the same energy minimum. The \"transition\" between them is thus more oscillatory than one would normally expect, and their time-averaged populations are close to 1/2. For a more typical scenario a more general conical intersection is \"required\".\n\nThe JT effect still comes into play, namely in combination with a different nearby, in general non-degenerate electronic state. The result is a pseudo Jahn–Teller effect, for example, of an E state interacting with an A state. This situation is common in JT systems, just as interactions between two nondegenerate electronic states are common for non-JT systems. Examples are excited electronic states of NH and the benzene radical cation. Here, crossings between the E and A state APESs amount to triple intersections, which are associated with very complex spectral features (dense line structures and diffuse spectral envelopes under low resolution). The population transfer between the states is also ultrafast, so fast that fluorescence (proceeding on a nanosecond time scale) cannot compete. This helps to understand why the benzene cation, like many other organic radical cation, does not fluoresce.\n\nTo be sure, photochemical reactivity emerges when the internal conversion makes the system explore the nuclear configuration space such that new chemical species are formed. There is a plethora of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopic techniques to reveal details of these processes occurring, for example, in the process of vision.\n\nAs proposed originally by Landau \nfree electrons in a solid, introduced for example by doping or irradiation, can interact with the vibrations of the lattice to form a localized quasi-particle known as a polaron. Strongly localized polarons (also called Holstein polarons) can condensate around high-symmetry sites of the lattice with electrons or holes occupying local degenerate orbitals that experience the JTE. These Jahn–Teller polarons break both translational and point group symmetries of the lattice where they are found and have been attributed important roles in effects like colossal magnetoresistance and superconductivity.\n\nParamagnetic impurities in semiconducting, dielectric, diamagnetic and ferrimagnetic hosts can all be described using a JT model. For example, these models were used extensively in the 1980s and 1990s to describe ions of Cr, V and Ti substituting for Ga in GaAs and GaP.\n\nThe fullerene C can form solid compounds with alkali metals known as fullerides. CsC can be superconducting at temperatures up to 38K under applied pressure, whereas compounds of the form AC are insulating (as reviewed by Gunnarsson ). JT effects both within the C molecules (intramolecular) and between C molecules (intermolecular) play a part in the mechanisms behind various observed properties in these systems. For example, they could mean that the Migdal-Eliashberg treatment of superconductivity breaks down. Also, the fullerides can form a so-called new state of matter known as a Jahn–Teller metal, where localised electrons coexist with metallicity and JT distortions on the C molecules persist \n\nThe JTE is usually associated with degeneracies that are well localised in space, like those occurring in a small molecule or associated to an isolated transition metal complex. However, in many periodic high-symmetry solid-state systems, like perovskites, some crystalline sites allow for electronic degeneracy giving rise under adequate compositions to lattices of JT-active centers. This can produce a cooperative JTE, where global distortions of the crystal occur due to local degeneracies.\n\nIn order to determine the final electronic and geometric structure of a cooperative JT system, it is necessary to take into account both the local distortions and the interaction between the different sites, which will take such form necessary to minimise the global energy of the crystal.\n\nWhile works on the cooperative JTE started in the late fifties \n\n, it was in 1960 that Kanamori published the first work on the cooperative JTE where many important elements present in the modern theory for this effect were introduced. This included the use of pseudospin notation to discuss orbital ordering, and discussions of the importance of the JTE to discuss magnetism, the competition of this effect with the spin-orbit coupling and the coupling of the distortions with the strain of the lattice. This point was later stressed in the review by Gehring and Gehring as being the key element to establish long-range order between the distortions in the lattice. An important part of the modern theory of the cooperative JTE, can lead to structural phase transitions.\n\nIt is important to note that many cooperative JT systems would be expected to be metals from band theory as, to produce them, a degenerate orbital has to be partially filled and the associated band would be metallic. However, under the perturbation of the symmetry-breaking distortion associated to the cooperative JTE, the degeneracies in the electronic structure are destroyed and the ground state of these systems is often found to be insulating (see e.g.). In many important cases like the parent compound for colossal magnetoresistance perovskites, LaMnO, an increase of temperature leads to disorder in the distortions which lowers the band splitting due to the cooperative JTE, thus triggering a metal-insulator transition.\n\nIn modern solid-state physics, it is common to classify systems according to the kind of degrees of freedom they have available, like electron (metals) or spin (magnetism). In crystals that can display the JTE, and before this effect is realised by symmetry-breaking distortions, it is found that there exists an orbital degree of freedom consisting of how electrons occupy the local degenerate orbitals. As initially discussed by Kugel and Khomskii, not all configurations are equivalent. The key is the relative orientation of these occupied orbital, in the same way that spin orientation is important in magnetic systems, and the ground state can only be realised for some particular orbital pattern. Both this pattern and the effect giving rise to this phenomenon is usually denominated orbital-ordering.\n\nIn order to predict the orbital-ordering pattern, Kugel and Khomskii used a particularisation of the Hubbard model. In particular they established how superexchange interactions, usually described by the Anderson–Kanamori–Goodenough rules, change in the presence of degenerate orbitals. Their model, using a pseudospin representation for the local orbitals, leads to a Heisenberg-like model in which the ground state is a combination of orbital and spin patterns. Using this model it can be shown, for example, that the origin of the unusual ground insulating ferromagnetic state of a solid like KCuF can be traced to its orbital ordering.\n\nEven when starting from a relatively high-symmetry structure the combined effect of exchange interactions, spin-orbit coupling, orbital-ordering and crystal deformations activated by the JTE can lead to very low symmetry magnetic patterns with specific properties. For example, in CsCuCl an incommensurable helicoidal pattern appears both for the orbitals and the distortions along the formula_35-axis. Moreover, many of these compounds show complex phase diagrams when varying temperature or pressure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964322", "title": "Thetford Forest", "text": "Thetford Forest\n\nThetford Forest is the largest lowland pine forest in Britain and is located in a region straddling the north of Suffolk and the south of Norfolk in England. It covers over in the form of a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nThetford Forest was created after the First World War to provide a strategic reserve of timber, since the country had lost so many oaks and other slow-growing trees as a consequence of the war's demands. It is managed by the Forestry Commission. The creation of the forest destroyed much of the typical Breckland environment of gorse and sandy ridges, ending the frequent sand blows (where the wind picked up sand and blew it across the land reducing visibility). However, this environment was itself man-made, since the area had been denuded by flint-mining, the construction of rabbit warrens and other activities. Grimes Graves is located within the forest.\n\nBy the end of the First World War the economic position of the large landed estates in England were bleak and particularly acute in areas of poor soil like Breckland. Farms were left untenanted and land became derelict. At this time the Forestry Commission had been established. In 1922, the first purchases of land were made with over 80% of the land in Thetford Forest acquired in the 1920s and 1930s in the form of large blocks of land from the former estates.\n\nSince the forest's inception decisions affecting the forest have been taken locally at the Divisional Offices at Santon Downham. At a local level, authority rested with the Divisional or District Officers. Many of these officers were recruited from affluent, land owning families who were attracted into forestry at the time when much of agriculture was in a depressed state. Foresters were the next level in the hierarchy and were often recruited from the forestry workers and by the 1940s they were trained for two years in the Commission's Forestry Schools. Beneath them were the \"gangers\" or foremen who supervised the forestry workers. The forest workers were organised into gangs of between three and thirty, their tasks included clearing ground, planting, weeding and later brashing and thinning.\n\nBreckland of the 1920s was an area of high unemployment and the Commission had few problems recruiting staff. From the outset the Commission believed that it would help alleviate unemployment in rural Britain. Many people were keen to take up forestry work, especially as the job included a tied cottage, many with an attached small holding. By the late 1920s, unemployed people, mainly miners, from the depressed areas of the North of England were housed in the forest holdings. As the depression deepened training camps were established. From 1928 up to 1938, 21 camps\nand a further 10 only used in the summer months housing a total of 6000 men were scattered throughout the infant forest. The unemployment schemes and mass unemployment came to an end with the onset of World War II.\n\nThe war years saw a drastic shortage of labour as local men joined the armed forces or took up other jobs. This led to a significant number of women employed in the forest. They were employed by the Timber Production Department, and by 1943 the Women's Land Army had a training camp at Wordwell on the edge of the forest. With the end of the war women workers gradually decreased. In 1946, the Forest Workers Training Scheme was set up providing one year's training for demobbed servicemen. During the post-war years the number of people employed increased to 570 by 1950. However, with the development of the nearby town of Thetford recruitment of labour became more difficult. With the introduction of modern technology and the use of modern weedkillers these problems eased through the sixties and by the mid-1970s the numbers of workers was similar to the 1930s.\n\nThe vast quantities of trees needed for the forest in its infancy needed huge amounts of seed much of it obtained locally. Men and women were sent out into the countryside, gathering cones from existing plantations and pine hedges. As the new plantations matured it was possible to obtain seed from the forest itself. From 1925 the seed was extracted from the cones at the Seed Extraction Unit at Santon Downham, this continued to be operated until 1964. Once the seed had germinated the seedlings were transplanted after one year's growth. This was later increased to two years. After being \"lined out\" in the nursery they were grown on for one to two years before they were planted in the forest.\n\nAs soon as a property was acquired by the Commission planting began with the majority of the forest planted within the first 20 years. The scots pine was the initial choice as the main forest tree given the adverse local conditions and seeds being readily available in the locality. However, the corsican pine was being established at several locations from the early 1920s. Today (2013), the tree is the dominant species in the forest owing to its having greater resistance to fungal diseases and insect pests, more tolerance of the thin chalky soils and producing a higher volume of timber per acre. Many other species of conifer were planted including the Douglas fir and larch but these were less tolerant of local conditions than the pines. Substantial numbers of indigenous hardwood trees were planted in the 1920s and 1930s. Oak and beech plantings were vulnerable to spring frosts and deer proved a threat particularly to the beech saplings. Oak tended to fare better but they grew slowly compared to pines, and were considered uneconomic with numbers being planted steadily declining. However, hardwood trees have been planted to form narrow roadside belts acting as a fire control measure. Besides oak and beech a wide variety of species including lime, walnut, red oak and maple have been established.\n\nAs the trees became established and were approximately 20 feet high all side shoots up to six feet were removed. This process called \"brashing\" ensured easy access, less risk of fire and the first six feet of the tree had a reduced knotty core. The next stage after brashing was \"pre-thinning\" this process was carried out after 15 to 16 years. It involved the removal of diseased trees. Larger trees known as \"wolves\" were also removed as they suppressed their smaller and straighter more valuable neighbours. Thinning began when the trees were 18 to 20 years old, coinciding with the start of World War 2. At this time there was much debate about how the work would be carried out. It was decided that \"racks\" or access ways 18 to 20 feet in width would be cut and then dividing the compartments into blocks covering 5 acres. Next, two rows of trees were removed to create a \"rack\" some 10 feet wide. The thinnings were graded and the straighter poles used as pit props in the coal industry. Other thinnings had a wide range of uses including fencing posts, pea poles in gardens and into netting stakes for the local rabbit warrens. Curved or irregular shaped cuttings was sold as firewood. In 1946, a central processing depot was established at Brandon to process poles into pit-props destined for the East Midlands coalfields. Large amounts of waste material was generated and this attracted a secondary industry of charcoal burning. As the forest matured the quantity of the thinnings increased with the disposal of them continued to be a problem. By 1950, demand from the National Coal Board for the timber decreased and the commission had to find new outlets, these included many of the smaller poles being cut up and converted into wallboard and some 60 tons of pine transported each week to a wood wool factory in Manchester. Large numbers of thinnings were taken to the Commission's own creosote plant at Santon Downham which was established in 1958 before closing in 1970. As the forest matured the size of the material being removed increased and clear felling of mature areas began with felled timber being sold directly to timber merchants. By the mid 1960s chainsaws had been introduced and by the early 1980s specially adapted tractors and trailers known as forwarders came into widespread operation. With the arrival of the harvester in 1991 full mechanization had reached the forest. Some 2500 trees were being extracted each day producing 180,000 cubic metres of timber annually by 1997. Much of this is sold to local saw mills and used in the building industry with the remainder producing fence posts, pallets and pit props.\n\nVisitor numbers have been increasing steadily from the 1950s as the forest matured and now exceed 1 million annually. Open areas created by felling have made the forest a more pleasant place for visitors to walk and picnic. These changes have now attracted a wider variety of wildlife including birds such as crossbills and nesting sparrowhawks which have increased interest from naturalists. The commissions changing attitude to the public was in part a response to the threat of privatisation in the 1980s. In 1985 the Thetford Forest Management Plan were recommending a wide range of measures including the importance of wildlife and the forest to be visually pleasing and culminated in May 1990 with forest designated as a Forest Park. The growing importance of recreation was reflected with the opening of the High Lodge visitor centre in 1992. Conservation in the management of the forest has greatly increased and by 1991 a Conservation Panel made up of experts in various relevant fields had been set up. Within the forest English Nature have designated 11 SSSIs which have been chosen as representative of the principal Breckland habitats.\n\nThe forest is largely surrounded by farmland, as well as the villages of West Stow, Ingham, Elveden, and the towns of Mundford and Thetford in Norfolk, and Brandon in Suffolk, however it has a high level of biodiversity. It is home to a large population of hares, rabbits and gamebirds. Several species of deer also reside there, muntjac, roe deer and a small population of red deer, the last hunted by the Norwich Staghounds before deer hunting was outlawed.\n\nThe forest is well known for its scarce breeding birds, such as woodlarks, nightjars, goshawks, crossbills, siskins as well as an introduced population of golden pheasants. All of these can be found at the Mayday recreation site. Stone curlews breed on the edges of the forest and there is often a wintering great grey shrike.\n\nHigh Lodge Visitors Centre was opened in 1992 and has a cafe, cycle hire, adventure play areas, walking trails, outdoor concerts, theatre and entertainment. It is also the home to the Go Ape high wire adventure course.\n\nThe forest is a popular destination for mountain biking, and has several marked trails ranging from those suitable for families, to two \"red trails\" for experienced riders. The forest also has hundreds of miles of singletrack, several \"black-graded\" bomb holes and a steeply undulating section called \"The Beast\" at the end of the Lime Burner Trail.\n\nNational cross-country cycling races are held in the forest. There is also a recently formed organisation called TIMBER (Thetford Improved Mountain Biking EnviRonment) which aims to work with the Forestry Commission to improve the mountain bike trails in the forest.\n\nAnnual music concerts from such luminaries as Pulp and Jools Holland are held in the forest at High Lodge. In 2007, saw The Feeling, Blondie, M People, Travis, James Morrison and Van Morrison take to the stage. Keane and Westlife played at Thetford on one of their forest tour dates in the summer of 2010. Madness, Razorlight, Plan B, The Wanted, Will Young, Steps, Ed Sheeran all played concerts in the forest during summer 2012. \n\nThe forest was used as a location for the BBC series \"Dad's Army\".\n\nThe Roman road, known as Peddars Way leads from the north Norfolk coast and reaches its end in Thetford Forest, near Knettishall. Other walking routes in the Forest connect to it. There is also a walk way through the trees called 'Go Ape'. There is a Center Parcs holiday resort at Elveden which also brings many visitors. The British Siberian Husky Racing Association hold several husky racing events in the forest each winter.\n\nA sizeable proportion of Thetford Forest and the surrounding woodlands is reserved for military activities in an area known as Stanford Battle Area, with public access forbidden.\n\nFour main roads bisect the forest at various points; A11, A134, A1064, A1065 and several minor roads. The forest towns of Brandon and Thetford are linked by the railway and the Little Ouse Path which approximately follows the course of the River Little Ouse.\n\n\n"}

It ranges from accurate historical reproductions of pioneer, mountain man, Civil War, cowboy and vaquero clothing to the stylized garments popularized by singing cowboys such as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers in the 1940s and 1950s. Western wear can be very informal, with a t-shirt and blue jeans forming a basic ensemble, or it may consist of tailored formal garments with western accents. At minimum, western wear generally incorporates a cowboy hat, a leather belt, and cowboy boots.\n\nIn the early days of the Old West, it was the bowler hat rather than the slouch hat, centercrease (derived from the army regulation Hardee hat), or sombrero that was the most popular among cowboys as it was less likely to blow out off in the wind. By the 1870s, however, the Stetson had become the most popular cowboy hat due to its use by the Union Cavalry as an alternative to the regulation blue kepi.\n\nStampede strings were installed to prevent the hat from being blown off when riding at speed. These long strings were usually made from leather or horsehair. Typically, the string was run half-way around the crown of a cowboy hat, and then through a hole on each side with its ends knotted and then secured under the chin or around the back of the head keeping the hat in place in windy conditions or when riding a horse.\n\nThe tall white ten gallon hats traditionally worn by movie cowboys were of little use for the historical gunslinger as they made him an easy target, hence the preference of lawmen like Wild Bill Hickok, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson for low-crowned black hats.\n\nOriginally part of the traditional Plains Indian clothing, coonskin caps were frequently worn by mountain men like Davy Crockett for their warmth and durability. These were revived in the 1950s following the release of a popular Disney movie starring Fess Parker.\n\nA Western shirt is a traditional item of Western Wear characterized by a stylized yoke on the front and on the back. It is generally constructed of denim or tartan fabric with long sleeves, and in modern form is sometimes seen with snap pockets, patches made from bandana fabric, and fringe. The \"Wild West\" era was during the late Victorian era, hence the direct similarity of fashion. \n\nA Western dress shirt is often elaborately decorated with piping, embroidered roses and a contrasting yoke. In the 1950s these were frequently worn by movie cowboys like Roy Rogers or Clayton Moore's Lone Ranger. Derived from the elaborate Mexican vaquero costumes like the guayabera and the battleshirts worn by many Confederate soldiers, these were worn at rodeos so the cowboy could be easily identifiable. Buffalo Bill was known to wear them with a buckskin fringe jacket during his Wild West shows and they were fashionable for teenagers in the 1970s and late 2000s.\n\nAnother common type of Western shirt is the shield-front shirt worn by many US Cavalry troopers during the American Civil War but originally derived from a red shirt issued to prewar firefighters. The cavalry shirt was made of blue wool with yellow piping and brass buttons and was invented by the flamboyant George Armstrong Custer. In recent times this shield-front shirt was popularised by John Wayne in \"Fort Apache\" and was also worn by rockabilly musicians like the Stray Cats.\n\nWhen a jacket is required there is a wide choice available for both linedancers and historical re-enactors. These include frock coats, ponchos popularised by Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti Westerns, short Mexican jackets with silver embroidery, fringe jackets popular among outlaw country, southern rock and 1980s heavy metal bands, and duster coats derived from originals worn in the Wild West. More modern interpretations include leather waistcoats inspired by the biker subculture and jackets with a design imitating the piebald color of a cow. Women may wear bolero jackets derived from the Civil War era zouave uniforms, shawls, denim jackets in a color matching their skirt or dress, or a fringe jacket like Annie Oakley.\n\nFor more formal occasions inhabitants of the West might opt for a suit with \"smile\" pockets, a half-belt at the rear, piping and a yoke similar to that on the Western shirts. This can take the form of an Ike jacket, leisure suit or three-button sportcoat. Country and Western singer Johnny Cash was known to wear an all-black Western suit, in contrast to the elaborate Nudie suits worn by stars like Elvis Presley and Porter Wagoner. The most elaborate western wear is the custom work created by rodeo tailors such as Nudie Cohn and Manuel, which is characterized by elaborate embroidery and rhinestone decoration. This type of western wear, popularized by country music performers, is the origin of the phrase \"rhinestone cowboy\".\n\nIn the early days of the Wild West trousers were made out of wool. In summer canvas was sometimes used. This changed during the Gold Rush of the 1840s when denim overalls became popular among miners for their cheapness and breathability. Levi Strauss improved the design by adding copper rivets and by the 1870s this design was adopted by ranchers and cowboys. The original Levi's jeans were soon followed by other makers including Wrangler jeans and Lee Cooper. These were frequently accessorised with kippy belts featuring metal conchos and large belt buckles.\n\nLeather chaps were often worn to protect the cowboy's legs from cactus spines and prevent the fabric from wearing out. Two common types include the skintight shotgun chaps and wide batwing chaps. The latter were sometimes made from hides retaining their hair (known as \"woolies\") rather than tanned leather. They appeared on the Great Plains somewhere around 1887.\n\nWomen wore knee-length prairie skirts, red or blue gingham dresses or suede fringed skirts derived from Native American dress. Saloon girls wore short red dresses with corsets, garter belts and stockings. After World War II, many women, returning to the home after working in the fields or factories while the men were overseas, began to wear jeans like the men.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, gentlemen would wear silk cravats or neckties to add color to their otherwise sober black or grey attire. These continued to be worn by respectable Westerners until the early 20th century. Following the Civil War it became common practise among working class veterans to loosely tie a bandana around their necks to absorb sweat and keep the dust out of their faces. This practise originated in the Mexican War era regular army when troops threw away the hated leather stocks (a type of collar issued to soldiers) and replaced them with cheap paisley kerchiefs.\n\nAnother well-known Western accessory, the bolo tie, was a pioneer invention reputedly made from an expensive hatband. This was a favorite for gamblers and was quickly adopted by Mexican charros, together with the slim \"Kentucky\" style bowtie commonly seen on stereotypical Southern gentlemen like Colonel Sanders or Boss Hogg. In modern times it serves as formal wear in many western states, notably Montana, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nSee Cowboy boot\n\n"}

During normal play, the upper and lower lips will vibrate together at the same speed. If, however, the lips are set to vibrate at different speeds two pitches may be perceived. When not done intentionally, split tones are referred to pejoratively as \"double buzzing\". \nIn \"Keren\" by Iannis Xenakis, split tones are notated with two pitches sharing a stem. The lower note is in parentheses. Though the notation is not explained in the score, in another work from 1986, \"Jalons\", Xenakis explains that the two notes should be produced with the lips and not with singing. Throughout \"Jalons\", Xenakis uses split tones extensively in the woodwinds and trombone.\n\nSplit tones can sound similar to a technique called growling, in which additional noise is produced from the throat while playing. The double buzz is distinctly different in that all noise and vibrations are initiated by the embouchure.\n\nLiza Lim makes extensive use of split tones in \"Ehwaz\" for trumpet and percussion. In the preface to the score, she states that split tones \"tend to be unstable and prone to distortion,\" and, \"it is expected that a degree of fluctuation or 'fraying' will occur in most split tones and this should be regarded as part of the overall timbral quality of the trumpet part.\"\n\nIn a blog post for his Cologne-based ensemble musikFabrik, American trombonist Bruce Collings provided a basic method for producing split tones:\n\nWhen split tones occur unintentionally, they are referred to as double buzzing. This phenomenon is widely understood to occur due to fatigue. David Hickman writes \"In most cases, double buzzes occur because of sore or bruised lips. This causes the player to tilt the mouthpiece unconsciously at an abnormal angle to relieve pressure on the sore area. In these cases rest over several days is the best remedy.\"\n\nA double buzz results from an uneven balance of pressure between the upper and lower lips. Tilting the horn either up or down will balance the pressure. Others suggest focusing on producing a clear tone on the mouthpiece only. It can be helpful to experiment with the double buzz and learn to produce it on demand. Learning to control it may help in learning to \"turn it off\" during regular playing.\n\nA completely different approach, favored by pedagogue William Adam and others, is for a student to not pay any attention to the physical aspects of the phenomenon and focus only on producing a clear, focused sound on the instrument.\n\n"}

He is known primarily for his work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he was a member of The Naturals alongside his tag team partner Andy Douglas.\n\nIn high school, Chase Stevens was a Golden Gloves boxing champion. After attending a professional wrestling training session, in order to watch a friend, Stevens decided to become a wrestler and joined the training school. After several weeks, veteran wrestler Tracy Smothers took him under his wing and became his trainer and mentor. Stevens debuted in 1998 under a mask as \"Glacius\", losing to fellow trainee Johnny B. Dazzled.\n\nStevens found a niche as a tag team specialist, teaming with Blaze as \"High Velocity\" and Cassidy O'Reilly as \"The Hotshots\". The latter team appeared with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in July 2002, and were given full-time contracts. The team split when Reilly left TNA due to travel problems, and Stevens was sent to USA Championship Wrestling for seasoning.\n\nIn USA Championship Wrestling Stevens was placed in a tag team with Andy Douglas by Bob Ryder. While on a fishing trip they chose the name \"Natural Heat\", which was later shortened to \"The Naturals\". The Naturals became a pair of sneaky, cheating villains.\n\nThe Naturals began working for Jerry Lawler's Memphis Wrestling promotion in 2003, where they were renamed \"The Alternative Express\". The Alternative Express - a gothic pair of rock fans who wore black clothing and recolored their hair and fingernails - were managed by The Goddess Athena.\n\nThe Naturals were brought into TNA in late 2003, immediately beginning a lengthy feud with America's Most Wanted. In the course of the feud, they defeated America's Most Wanted for the NWA World Tag Team Championship on July 7, 2004. The Naturals successfully defended their titles against Triple X, but were eventually beaten by Chris Harris and Elix Skipper (one member of each team) on September 8, 2004.\n\nIn 2005, The Naturals formed an alliance with Chris Candido, who also became their manager. On April 26, they defeated America's Most Wanted to become NWA World Tag Team Champions for a second time. The sudden death of Candido two days later led to a surge in popularity for The Naturals, eventually turning them into fan favorites.\n\nOn June 19, 2005 at Slammiversary, The Naturals were assisted in a title defence against Team Canada by Jimmy Hart. They were managed by Hart throughout mid-2005, with their reign ending on the October 22 episode of \"TNA Impact!\". Then they lost to America's Most Wanted following interference from Jeff Jarrett and Gail Kim. They were defeated by AMW in their rematch at Bound for Glory on October 23, again following interference from Kim.\n\nDuring the October 25 \"Impact!\" tapings, Stevens injured his neck after landing badly during a match. He was diagnosed as having suffered an avulsion fracture of his C5 and C6 vertebrae, in addition to herniating his C4 vertebra (described by TNA as the \"mildest form of trauma associated with a broken neck\"). The injury did not require surgery, and Stevens returned for Genesis on November 13, teaming with Douglas and Lance Hoyt in a loss to the Diamonds in the Rough.\n\nIn April 2006, Stevens began a bit of singles work in light of his partner being injured by Scott Steiner. Stevens' singles run did not go overly well, as he was unable to post a victory in any of his competitions, losing to Samoa Joe twice, Abyss once, and losing an Xscape match at Lockdown 2006.\n\nIn June 2006, Stevens and Douglas began to be managed by the returning Shane Douglas after he approached them, asking to be their manager. The duo accepted his offer and were shown \"training\" in several vignettes which aired on \"Impact!\".\n\nAt Victory Road, The Naturals returned in brand new black and yellow attire (to replace their black and pink attire) and were managed by Shane Douglas. They were called 'The Newly Franchised Naturals', in reference to Shane's nickname 'The Franchise', and beat The Diamonds In The Rough. On the August 17 edition of \"Impact!\", Stevens defeated Chris Harris, Frankie Kazarian and B.G. James to win a tag team championship shot for him and Andy. Shane took their tag title match away from them after they lost a match on \"Impact!\" to teach them a lesson. They then won a Tag Team \"Triple Chance\" Battle Royal the following month at No Surrender. This suggested that their push that had been going for several months would finally conclude with them getting a tag title shot at Bound for Glory, but they ended up losing a Four Corners match on the undercard of the show, not even getting the title shot. The Naturals then began a feud with Team 3D and defeated them in a Tables match on TNA's primetime debut. Then it started speculation that the storyline would once again get better for The Naturals, but then on the December 21 episode of \"Impact!\", Shane turned his back on The Naturals after they lost the second Tables match to Team 3D, saying \"This experiment is over\".\n\nStevens wrestled Lance Hoyt at Final Resolution on January 14, 2007. He lost the match, which led to Shane coming out asking why he was wearing the Franchised gear, when he said the experiment was over. This led to Stevens shoving him, with security separating the two. On May 10 both Stevens and Douglas were released from their contracts.\n\nStevens alongside his Naturals partner, Andy Douglas, were originally going to receive a try-out match for World Wrestling Entertainment at a \"Raw\" taping in September 2007, but was cancelled when Douglas posted the tryout information on his Myspace without WWE's permission.\n\nStevens later appeared on the March 21, 2008 edition of \"WWE SmackDown\", alongside his Naturals partner Andy Douglas, fighting in a losing effort to the Big Show. He made another appearance on the September 16, 2008 edition of \"ECW\", losing to Jack Swagger and again the next week against Mike Knox.\n\nStevens was in attendance for a tryout at the March 12, 2012 \"WWE RAW SuperShow\" in Cleveland. The next day, on March 13, 2012, Stevens wrote on his Twitter page that he was backstage in Columbus for the \"SmackDown\" tapings, saying he was as ready as he will ever be.\n\nStevens returned to wrestle on the southeast independent circuit with Naturals partner Andy Douglas. He has wrestled in many organizations such as Showtime All-Star Wrestling, United States Wrestling Organization, United Wrestling Association and The Jerry Lawler Tribute Show where he and Andy Douglas defeated Big Bully Douglas and Seven. In late 2008 Andy Douglas turned on Stevens while Stevens teamed with Arrick Andrews and Nikki Vaughn in a tag team match against the A-Team thus Douglas aligned himself with The A-Team joining TNA Alumni, David Young and Rick Santel. This created a bitter rivalry between the two spanning over a year long and culminating in several matches, until Andy's retirement in early 2010. Chase Stevens is a former SAW International Heavyweight Champion, a championship he won from Kid Kash on the same night Andy Douglas and himself, had their final war. He lost the title to Phill Shatter.\n\nOn September 28, 2012, Stevens defeated Matt Hardy in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee at KFW Black Harvest 2012. On October 20, 2012, Stevens defeated John Skyler, Jon Malus and Sixx at WrestleForce Fall Brawl 3: All Or Nothing to win the WrestleForce Championship.\n\nOn November 3, 2012, at Crossfire Wrestling's TV Taping The Hot Shots (Cassidy Riley and Chase Stevens) defeated Diamonds in the Rough (David Young and Sigmon) in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOn May 17, 2013, at WrestleForce Revenge Stevens teamed with TNA Superstars Crimson, D.O.C and Gunner defeating Team WrestleForce Brady Pierce, Cedric Alexander, John Skyler and Jon Malus.\n\nOn May 30, 2014, Stevens participated in a match for the UCW (Universal Championship Wrestling) Heavyweight title in a street fight, but lost the match. He faced Rhyno after \"The Headliner\" Chris Michaels was a no-show.\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Stevens challenged Rob Conway for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at the NWA SAW Gathering of the Champions event, the match ended in a draw after time had expired. In 2014, Chase Stevens participated in a Triple Threat Match in Puerto Rico for the Entertainment Wrestling Organization's (EWO) World Championship against Dameon Slugga and Mike Piconose, during EWO's \"Renacer\" (Reborn) event, where Stevens successfully captured the championship. On May 11, 2015, Stevens was announced as part of the roster for the Global Force Wrestling (GFW) promotion.\n\nStevens returned to TNA on March 17, 2013 as he took part in 10 man Battle Royal which featured TNA Wrestlers from the past and present, the match was won by Matt Morgan.\n\nOn March 18, 2013, The Hot Shots (Cassidy Riley and Chase Stevens) were defeated by the Aces & Eights (Wes Brisco and Garett Bischoff) in the first round of the TNA Tag Team Tournament.\n\nStevens appeared in the film \"Chained: Code 207\" alongside TNA wrestler Crimson and OVW wrestler Ryan Howe.\n\n\n"}

Farmlands cover the west and southwest dominating about 50 km² and to the east. The downtown streets are aligned at a 45° angle. Snake Island is situated to the northwest. A small bay is to the northeast.\n\nHousing developments came in the mid-20th century to the northern part and continued slowly until the 1980s. The subdivision 2 km to the east continued in the 1980s and the early-1990s whereas each street is alphabetized from A to L. Housing projects later slowed in the 1990s and the 2000s and the population has slowed. Cottages are also found in the area located along the shore of Lake Simcoe.\n\nThe first inhabitants were Aboriginal people, as Sutton was a rich area for hunting, fishing, and gathering thousands of years ago. \n\nJames O'Brien Bourchier was the first settler in 1821 and built saw and grist mills. The community was originally named \"Bourchier's Mills\", but was renamed \"Sutton West\" in 1885, possibly after Sutton-on-Hull in East Yorkshire. However, it's usually called just \"Sutton\".\n\nSibbald Point Provincial Park is a day use and campground facility, with a large sandy beach, electrical and non-electrical sites, hiking trails, boating access to Lake Simcoe, and the Sibbald Family Museum. \nLocated near the shore of Lake Simcoe, the Pioneer Village is a 10-acre space with many buildings to teach the history of Georgina between the years of 1850 and 1920.

Napoleon called him “a universal man with taste, understanding and genius capable of creating the arts of France in the middle of the Arabian Desert.”\n\nOne of his early interests while still at Sées was in the newly developing science of aeronautics. He made at least one hot air balloon which he flew in the public square. He contributed to the improvement of the production of hydrogen gas, as well as the treatment of the gas bag of the balloon itself.\n\nIn Egypt Conté was called on to exercise his expertise in ballooning and was asked to prepare an ascent for the celebration of the French New Year on 22 September 1798. He was not sufficiently prepared so the event was postponed to 1 December. On that occasion his efforts met with a near disaster. The balloon caught fire and the Egyptians received the impression that what had been demonstrated was a machine of war for setting fire to the enemy encampments. At a second attempt with a larger balloon, it is said that the ascent was witnessed in Esbekia Square by 100,000. It is probable that the use of the balloon in Egypt was limited to impressing the local population and was never found suitable for military purposes. Al-Jabarti, (‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti al-Misri) in his account of the ascent said “Their claim that this apparatus is like a vessel in which people sit and travel to other countries in order to discover news and other falsifications did not appear to be true.”\n\nConté invented the modern pencil lead at the request of Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot. The French Republic was at that time under economic blockade and unable to import graphite from Great Britain, the main source of the material. Carnot asked Conté to create a pencil that did not rely on foreign imports. After several days of research, Conté had the idea of mixing powdered graphite with clay and pressing the material between two half-cylinders of wood. Thus was formed the modern pencil. Conté received a patent for the invention in 1795, and formed la Société Conté to make them. He also invented the conté crayon named after him, a hard pastel stick used by artists.\n\nAt the 1798 Exposition des produits de l'industrie française Conté won an honorable distinction, the highest award, for his \"crayons of various colours\".\n"}

He is a former world No. 1 in doubles, and also a former world No. 4 in singles. Björkman retired from professional tennis after competing at the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup doubles championships. As of 2019, he is ranked in the top 40 on the all-time ATP prize money list with over 14 million dollars.\n\nOn 20 November 2006, he replaced Dick Norman as the oldest player in the ATP top 100 (singles) when Norman dropped out of the top 100 for the last time. On 9 June 2008, aged 36 years and 2 months, Björkman was himself succeeded in this honor by Fabrice Santoro.\n\nBjörkman has had long-term successful doubles partnerships with Jan Apell, Jacco Eltingh, Nicklas Kulti, Max Mirnyi, Patrick Rafter, Kevin Ullyett, and Todd Woodbridge. He has won the career Grand Slam in men's doubles, holding a total of nine major championships.\n\nIn March 2015, he joined Andy Murray's coaching team.\n\nThe son of tennis coach and mailman Lars Björkman, Jonas began playing tennis at the age of six. At 18, he won the Swedish Junior Championship and was among the top-5 Swede junior players. He married Petra on 2 December 2000 in Stockholm, and they have a son, Max (born 15 January 2003).\n\nHe plays right-handed and has a particularly good record against left-handed players. He claims it's because his father plays left-handed.\n\nHe turned professional in 1991. In 1993, he won three Challenger singles titles. In 1994, he won seven titles in doubles including the 1994 ATP Tour World Championships in Jakarta. In 1995, he reached his first career ATP singles final in Hong Kong. In 1997, he became the ninth ever Swedish tennis player to finish in ATP top 10 at No. 4. He advanced to his first Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open, defeating Francisco Clavet, Todd Martin, Gustavo Kuerten, Scott Draper and Petr Korda before losing to Greg Rusedski. At the 1998 Australian Open, he won his first career doubles Grand Slam title. 2000 saw him finishing in the singles top 50 for the fifth time in seven years.\n\nIn his ATP career, he won six singles titles and 54 titles in doubles, including nine Grand Slam titles in doubles.\n\nHe made his Davis Cup debut in 1994 and has played regularly for Sweden ever since.

He was a member of Sweden's Davis Cup championship teams in 1994, 1997, and 1998.\n\nIn 2002, Björkman won the Nottingham Open by defeating Wayne Arthurs in the final, however, at Wimbledon, he found himself drawn against top seed Lleyton Hewitt in the first round. Björkman was defeated in straight sets, as Hewitt went on to win the tournament.\n\nIn the 2006 Wimbledon, he unexpectedly made it into the singles semifinals at the age of 34, making him the oldest player to get there since Jimmy Connors in 1987. He had only made it into the singles quarterfinals once in 2003. He was unseeded, but defeated 14th-seeded Radek Štěpánek in a match which included saving a match point. He had previously ousted his doubles partner Max Mirnyi and another Swede, Thomas Johansson, and Lukáš Dlouhý and Daniele Bracciali to make the quarterfinals. In the semifinal he found world No. 1 and defending champion Roger Federer too good and was overpowered in straight sets, 6–2, 6–0, 6–2.\nWhen John McEnroe announced his official return to the ATP Pro Tour in 2006, he teamed up with Björkman to win the doubles title at the SAP Open in San Jose.\n\nDuring Wimbledon in 2008, he announced that he would be playing in his final Wimbledon as he was planning on retiring at the end of the season. Although being knocked out in the first round of singles, Björkman and Kevin Ullyett made it to the final, being defeated by second seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić, though receiving a hero's farewell to his extensive career at Wimbledon.\n\nBjörkman retired from professional tennis, after the Swede and his partner Ullyett failed to qualify for the doubles semifinal at the 2008 Maters Cup.\n\nOn 2 October 2013, he announced a comeback on tour in If Stockholm Open doubles draw, receiving a wild card in pair with fellow countryman Robert Lindstedt.\n\nHe competed as a celebrity dancer in Let's Dance 2015.\n\nAndy Murray added Björkman to his coaching staff in March initially on a five-week trial to help out in periods when Amélie Mauresmo was unavailable as she only agreed to work with him for 25 weeks. However, at the end of the Australian Open, Mauresmo had informed Murray that she was pregnant and he announced at the end of April, that Björkman would be his main coach for all of the grass-court season and all of the US hard-court swing, while Mauresmo would only be with the team for Wimbledon. Jonas Björkman joined Murray's team in April 2015, helping Murray win the BMW Open in Munich; his first clay-court title. This was followed by Murray winning his first Masters 1000 title on clay in Madrid. In June 2015, Björkman coached Andy Murray through Queen's where he ended up winning his fourth Queen's Club title at the Aegon Championships. In the middle of December 2015, Murray decided not to renew Bjorkman’s contract. The Swede, who joined the world No. 2’s entourage earlier in 2015, took charge of his coaching for the last four months of the season in the absence of Amélie Mauresmo but will not be part of the team in future.\n\n"}

{"id": "1964425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964425", "title": "Automatic Pilot", "text": "Automatic Pilot\n\nAutomatic Pilot was a San Francisco, California band. Created in 1980 by members of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, they were described by The Advocate as \"a non-official offshoot\" of SFGMC along with three official subgroups. Automatic Pilot soon came into their own as an independent force, creating a niche at the fringe of the nascent gay musical movement and a new musical style.\n\nThey achieved notoriety early on with songs such as \"Sit On My Face\" and \"Killer Purses\" performed at benefits for the SFGMC, Theatre Rhinoceros, and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. They derived their name from psychiatric testimony at Dan White's trial for killing Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.\n\nThe ensemble consisted of up to four part vocals led by Matthew McQueen, backed by pianist Karl Brown, with violin, flute/sax, and a string bassist and drummer from the San Francisco Lesbian/Gay Freedom Band.\n\nWith an acoustic parody of punk rock as a starting point, writers Brown and McQueen incorporated elements of jazz, classical, theater and the avant-garde into somewhat twisted song structures that are both interesting and accessible. Their sound, dubbed \"erotic jazz wave\" has been compared to cartoon music, klezmer, and Frank Zappa. Automatic Pilot anticipated the queercore bands by a decade. The post-punk genre fits best due to the time period, punk influence and experimental bent.\n\nAutomatic Pilot continued to perform in San Francisco at various venues including the Castro Street Fair, the On Broadway Theater and the Valencia Rose gay performance space, venturing as far as the Chute II Bar in Reno.\n\nAutomatic Pilot was covered regularly by local media including the San Francisco Chronicle. The Bay Area Reporter published four full length articles on the band between 1982 and 1985. Their music was featured on regional radio shows including KPFA's Fruit Punch. Nationally, they appeared in the New York Native and The Advocate, which singled them out along with the band Orquestra Sabrosita as vibrant independent artists in contrast to \"the financial concerns and artistic reserve of the larger gay cultural institutions\" of San Francisco in 1982. They were played on the nationally syndicated Dr. Demento radio show.\n\nIn 1983, vocalist Tony Kramedas set out to produce an album for major label release. These recordings, done over time as budget permitted, had a more electric 80's sound with guitars, synthesizers and drum machines. The project came to a halt when Kramedas became ill; he died in 1985, as have several other band members. During Automatic Pilot's final months, Brown and McQueen became involved in writing and performing music for the original 1984 Theatre Rhinoceros production of The AIDS Show.\n\nThe master tapes sat on a shelf until 2002 when the Automatic Pilot website was launched, with many complete recordings in mp3 and ogg format of live performances and studio works, and a detailed history. The site also features music from The AIDS Show and newly rediscovered video (in both H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and MPEG-1 format) from Automatic Pilot's December 1982 performance at the Valencia Rose.

{"id": "1964435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964435", "title": "Eyrbyggja saga", "text": "Eyrbyggja saga\n\nEyrbyggja saga () is one of the Icelanders' sagas; its title can be translated as \"The Saga of the People of Eyri.\" It was written by an anonymous writer, who describes a long-standing feud between Snorri Goði and Arnkel Goði, two strong chieftains within the Norse community that settled in Iceland. The title is slightly misleading as it deals also with the clans from Þórsnes and Alptafjörðr on Iceland. The most central character is Snorri Þorgrímsson, referred to as Snorri Goði and Snorri the Priest. Snorri was the nephew of the hero of \"Gísla saga\", and is also featured prominently in \"Njáls saga\" and \"Laxdœla saga\". Another main interest of the \"Eyrbyggja Saga\" is to trace a few key families as they settled Iceland, specifically around the Snæfellsnes peninsula.\n\nThe Saga is usually not regarded as artistically equal to \"Egil's saga\", \"Njáls saga\" and \"Laxdæla saga\". Nevertheless, it is valued for many reasons, including its historical and folkloric elements. The saga is characterized by a distinct interest in old lore, rituals, pagan practices and superstitions. The saga includes several references to the colonization of Greenland and one reference to an expedition to Vinland. It also mentions a journey by Guðleifr Guðlaugsson and his crew to Great Ireland, which was said to exist beyond Vinland.\n\nSections of the \"Eyrbyggja Saga\" have survived in fragments from the 13th century and in numerous manuscripts from the 14th century.\n\nThe Saga portrays the different families and individuals living on Iceland at Snæfellsnes. There is constant fighting between the different clans on Snæfellsnes, mostly over resources such as wood, property, and livestock. The different Norsemen represented in the Saga constantly turn to Snorri and Arnkel for advice and permission to take legal and/or physical action against perpetrators that have wronged them.\n\nThe story of the Eyrbyggja Saga frequently turns on actions that stem from greed, fear, ambition or downright meanness, as it describes cold-hearted bargaining between farmers and chieftains. All of the events of the Saga take place in one small region of Snæfellsnes, shifting between Álptafjord, which cuts into the northern shore of the peninsula, and Helgafell, the farmstead on Thórsnes, where Snorri Goði resided. The Saga shows a steady shift from paganism on Iceland to Christianity over the course of roughly twenty years.\n\nThe saga was most likely written in its entirety in the mid- or late-13th century, but historians have not yet been able to pinpoint an exact date. The narrative begins at the time of the Norse settlement in Iceland as early as the 9th century, but most of the events take place towards the end of the 10th century and the early 11th century. There is also internal evidence that the author of the saga knew of Laxdœla saga and Egils saga.\n\nThe Saga cannot be taken too literally, since it is a story and not a written history. Many of the places, events, and people are quite real, but the some of situations are questionable. The author tends to favor Snorri Goði over any other character in the Saga. This is probably because the author was a Christian scholar and wished to praise Snorri for popularizing Christianity and declaring it the official religion on Iceland.\n\n\nSnorri acted as the chieftain of Snæfellsnes, and the author constantly depicts him as the wise, classical hero. The Saga's main area of focus is featured around his life. Snorri also converted to Christianity and declared Christianity the official religion of Iceland. He permitted the construction of Christian churches around Snæfellsnes. \n\nIn chapter 37, Snorri and his foster brothers kill Arnkel whilst he is working on his farm. In the ensuing court case regarding the murder of Arnkel, only Thorleif Thorbrandsson (Þorbrandsson) was convicted and outlawed. Snorri, after killing Arnkel, later sided with his foster brothers, the Thorbrandssons (Þorbrandssons), in their feud with the Thorlaksson family. He took part in the battle of Alftafjord with his foster brothers and rescued them after they were all wounded at the battle of Vigrafjord. A compromise was later reached between the two families, after Snorri courted his daughter with the son of Thormod Thorlaksson. Snorri also made an attempt to kill Bjorn Asbrandsson, who had an affair with his sister Thurid while she was married to Thorodd the Tribute Trader, a marriage that Snorri helped to arrange. Bjorn fended off Snorri's attack, but was later convinced to leave Iceland.\n\nSnorri in his later years successfully led a fight against Ospak Kjallaksson, a Norseman who had assembled a group of men that constantly attacked and pillaged his neighbors. Snorri and his gang killed Ospak and the other members of his group. Snorri spared Ospak's son and allowed him inherit his father's farm. Snorri had several children and was able to create marriage alliances with many leading families in Iceland. Snorri's descendants included the Sturlungs, through his son Halldor.\n\nArnkel, like Snorri, acted as chieftain over the peoples of Holyfell, and was also referred to as \"Arnkel the Priest.\" He is often depicted as the enemy of Snorri by the author. Arnkel provides similar information to the Norse living on Iceland on such matters as property rights and blood feuds. Arnkel became involved in further disputes with Snorri after Arnkel's father, Thorolf Halt-foot, accused Snorri of stealing his firewood. As the Saga progresses, Arnkel claims properties around Snæfellsnes, in which he also claims land from peoples who he presided over.\n\nArnkel finally engages in a physical dispute with Snorri and the Thorbrandssons (Þorbrandsson), Snorri's foster brothers. Snorri and his foster brothers attack and kill Arnkel whilst he was working on his farm.\n\nThe Saga reveals Erik the Red's discovery of Greenland. He stayed there for three winters, returned to Iceland for a winter, and then returned to settle permanently in Greenland. The saga does not give a specific time of when this took place, but it does suggest that it was fourteen years before Snorri declared Christianity the official religion of Snæfellsnes.\n\n\"Eyrbyggja Saga\" describes numerous supernatural events that mainly consist of undead animals rising up through the floor and Draugrs coming into the house to warm themselves by the fire. The Draugrs in the Saga have a mixture of characteristics that are \"typical\" of Norse ghosts.\n\nChapter 31 of \"Eyrbyggja Saga\" reveals the death of Thorolf Halt-Foot, who is also the father of Arnkel. Thorolf is reincarnated as a Draugr and a frightening marauder who leaves his tomb to cause devastation around Þórsnes. Thorolf's undead ventures also reveal specific overtones from the Wild Hunt legends. Thorolf's body is buried, reburied, burned, and is reincarnated as a bull, though he continued to cause relentless terror for nearly a year before he finally was permanently laid to rest by Arnkel, who buried his remains on a hillside. Arnkel constructed a high stone wall around Thorolf's grave so that Thorolf could not overcome it. However, Thorolf seemed to continually haunt the hillside where he was buried. \n\nChapters 50–51 of the Saga show a sickly, wealthy seafaring woman named Thorgunna from the south of Iceland who requested at her death bed to be buried in Skálaholt, her sheets and bedding to be burned, and her wealth to be donated to the Christian church. Upon Thorgunna's death, Thorodd, a friend, burns all her bedding except her bed sheets, which he gave to his wife as a gift. Thorodd donates her wealth to the church, and transports her body south to Skálaholt in a coffin. At nightfall, Thorodd decides to rest on a farmstead just outside Skálaholt. In the middle of the night, Thorodd and the farmstead owners awaken to find a dead, naked Thorgunna setting the dinner table and preparing a meal to eat. The farm owner tries to speak to Thorgunna and she disappears after having prepared a full meal. Thorodd along with the other members transporting the corpse and the homesteaders of the farm bless the meat by sprinkling holy water on it, eat the meat without harm, and then sleep peacefully through the night. The next day Thorgunna's corpse is transported to Skálaholt and laid to rest, never disturbing Thorodd or his kinsmen again.\n\nFollowing the death of Thorgunna, the author describes the death of a shepherd at Frodis-water where Thorgunna had once resided. The shepherd haunted the house at Frodis-water until Thorir Wooden-leg fell sick and died after encountering the shepherd's ghost. The shepherd and Thorir haunted Frodis-water, in which four more people fell sick and died one after the other. During the winter just before the Yule Feast, the constant sound of fisherman skinning fish could be heard outside the Frodis-water house. Additionally, a crew of six men were often seen manning a ten-oared boat not far from the shoreline. One night when the Frodis-water inhabitants were gathering for dinner, a seal's head began to emerge from the floor. The people of the house tried to smash the seal back down into the floor boards with sticks and clubs, but the seal kept steadily rising, further out of the floor after each blow. Kiartan, a young man at Frodis-water, ran into the house with a sledge hammer and struck the seal back down into the floorboards.\n\nFollowing the incident with the seal at Frodis-water, Thurid and Kiartan invite their neighbors to Frodis-water for the Yule Feast. As Thurid, Kiartan and the guests are dining and sitting about the fire, Thorir and his followers entered the house and shake their dirty clothes all over the house, throwing mud on the guests. The next three nights, Kiartan moves the guests and the fire in to a different room, however Thorir and the other ghosts continue to enter the house, flinging mud and killing servants and farm-hands. Eventually, Snorri, who was also Kiartan's uncle, banishes Thorir and the ghosts from Snæfellsnes using an effective combination of Christian rituals and Icelandic common-laws.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His body of work as a writer for television and film, most notably for the BBC science fiction series \"Doctor Who\", lasted from 1962 to 1978.\n\nHayles wrote six stories for \"Doctor Who\" and is best known for his creation of the Celestial Toymaker in the 1966 story of the same name, the Ice Warriors, introduced in the 1967 story of the same name, and the feudal planet Peladon, the setting for \"The Curse of Peladon\" and its sequel \"The Monster of Peladon\". His other stories were \"The Smugglers\" and \"The Seeds of Death\".\n\nIn addition to script writing for the radio series \"The Archers\", Hayles penned a novel based on the soap called \"Spring at Brookfield\" (Tandem, 1975) set in the period between the two world wars. His other books included novelisations of his \"Doctor Who\" serials \"The Curse of Peladon\" (Target, 1974) and \"The Ice Warriors\" (Target, 1976), an adaptation of his scripts for the BBC drama \"The Moon Stallion\" (Mirror Books, 1978), and two horror plays for children, \"The Curse of the Labyrinth\" (Dobson, 1976) and \"Hour of the Werewolf\" (Dobson, 1976). In 1979, NEL published, posthumously, his original novel \"Goldhawk\", a heist-thriller set around Heathrow Airport.\n\nApart from \"Doctor Who\", Hayles wrote for such television series as \"The Regiment\", \"Barlow at Large\", \"Doomwatch\", \"Out of the Unknown\", \"United!\", \"Legend of Death\", \"Public Eye\", \"Z-Cars\", \"BBC Playhouse\", \"The Wednesday Thriller\" and \"Suspense\". He also wrote the screenplays for the feature films \"Nothing But the Night\" (1972) and \"Warlords of Atlantis\" (1978). The novelisation of the latter by Paul Victor (Futura, 1978) included a preface by Hayles entitled 'The Thinking Behind Atlantis' in which he explained the origins of the film's central concepts. Hayles contributed to a BBC series called Slim John which was an English Language course taught via the medium of science fiction scenarios.\n\nHayles's final screenplay was for \"Arabian Adventure\" (1979), which he completed shortly before his death on 30 October 1978. The novelisation of the film by Keith Miles (Mirror Books, 1979) was dedicated to his memory.\n\n"}
{"id": "1964437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964437", "title": "Servatius of Tongeren", "text": "Servatius of Tongeren\n\nSaint Servatius (; , ) (born in Armenia, died in Maastricht, traditionally on 13 May 384) was bishop of Tongeren —Latin: \"Atuatuca Tungrorum\", the capital of the Tungri—. Servatius is patron saint of the city of Maastricht and the towns of Schijndel and Grimbergen. He is one of the Ice Saints. His feast day is May 13.\n\nA widely travelled diplomat and a determined prosecutor of Arianism, the presence of Servatius is recorded at several synods and church councils. In 343, \"Sarbatios\" - Greek texts rendering \"v\" as \"b\" - was present at the Council of Sardica (modern Sofia). In the debates, Servatius represented the Trinitarian view, which clashed with the Arian view of most Eastern bishops. When Athanasius, leader of the anti-Arian party, was in exile in Trier, he may have met with Servatius in Trier or Tongeren, because both men campaigned against Arian bishops and priests in the region. In 346, at the Council of Cologne, Servatius testified against the bishop of Cologne, saying that \"he denied the divinity of Jesus Christ, this even happened in the presence of Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria\", adding to this \"our churches are adjacent\".\n\nAfter co-emperor Constans had been assassinated in 350, Servatius was sent to the Roman emperor Constantius II in Edessa, the capital of Armenian Mesopotamia, as an envoy of the usurper Magnentius to represent the late Constans as an unworthy tyrant and oppressor, in the hope of obtaining Constantius' recognition of Magnentius as co-ruler. The mission failed and the resulting civil war ended with the death of Magnentius in 353. The mission can be seen as a sign of the high standing of Servatius. In 359, at the Council of Rimini, Sulpicius Severus reports that Servatius again eloquently denounced Arianism.\n\nAn important source about the life of Saint Servatius, albeit not a contemporary source, is Gregory of Tours' \"Glory of the Confessors\" and \"History of the Franks\". In his late 6th-century account, Gregory writes about \"Aravatius\" (identified by most scholars as Servatius), who was a bishop of Tongeren and died in Maastricht. According to the Frankish bishop and historian, Aravatius lived at the time when the Huns threatened Tongeren (5th century), which does not match the 4th-century dates of the synods mentioned above. It is not always clear how much of Gregory's account is history and how much is (pious) fiction. Gregory describes how Servatius, during a vigil at Saint Peter's tomb in Rome, had a vision in which the destruction of Tongeren was forecast (because of their sinfulness). Peter then handed the Keys of Heaven to Servatius, transferring to him the power to forgive sins. According to Gregory, Servatius returned to Tongeren, brought the relics of his predecessors to Maastricht, where he died and was buried alongside the Roman road, near the bridge.\n\nAs a bishop, Servatius may have been the founder of several early Christian churches in the diocese of Tongeren. Two likely candidates are the Basilica of Our Lady in Tongeren and the Basilica of Our Lady in Maastricht. In the case of Tongeren, this traditional claim was supported by excavations in the 1980s, which revealed under the medieval church remains of a 4th-century church, possibly the original cathedral of the diocese. The origins of the Maastricht church of Our Lady remain uncertain, since no excavations have ever been carried out inside this church. In another Maastricht church however, the Basilica of Saint Servatius, excavations in the 1990s have revealed the remains of a 6th-century church (built by bishop Monulph and described by Gregory of Tours as a \"magnum templum\"), with at its center a late Roman structure, possibly the tomb of Servatius.\n\nOver the centuries legends accumulated around the historical figure of the bishop of Tongeren. Two early \"vitae\" (biographies) place Servatius' birth in Armenia and make him a cousin of John the Baptist, and thus a distant relative of Jesus (neither were mentioned by Gregory of Tours).\n\nAround 1075, the French priest Jocundus was commissioned by the chapter of Saint Servatius to write another \"Vita sancti Servatii\". Jocundus is also the author of the \"Miracula sancti Servatii\", a sequel to the vita, describing all the miracles that happened after Servatius' death. According to some historians, both works were composed to quell doubts about the genealogy of Servatius and his Armenian descent. These doubts had been raised at the Council of Mainz in 1049. When envoys from the Byzantine emperor arrived at the Council of Mainz, confirming accounts by a certain Alagrecus who had testified that Servatius was Armenian, and asserting that his birthplace was \"Fenuste\", southeast of Damascus, this helped to erase some doubts but Servatius' kinship to Jesus was never confirmed by an official council.\n\nAt the end of the 12th century the poet Henric van Veldeke wrote a new legend of Saint Servatius, based on the earlier accounts by Gregory of Tours and Jocundus, to which he added several more miracles, thus emphasizing Saint Servatius' saintliness. The work is considered one of the earliest works of Dutch literature, even though it was written in Limburgish, the most divergent of the 4 major dialects that comprises Middle Dutch.\n\nIn the 17th century, the Bollandists tried to separate some of the facts and myths surrounding Servatius. They managed to calculate the exact date of his death (13 May 384), which for a long time was accepted as a historical fact.\nAccording to tradition the saint's remains are buried in the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht, where they lie in a crypt dating from the 6th century. His tomb has been a place of pilgrimage for many centuries. Famous visitors include Charlemagne, Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor), Philip II of Spain and Pope John Paul II. In Maastricht, the Orthodox Church belonging to the Russian Exarchate of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is also dedicated to Saint Servatius. The Sint Servaasbrug, the oldest bridge over the river Meuse in Maastricht, was named after Saint Servatius. The name 'Servaas' was a popular given name in Maastricht and surroundings for many centuries.\n\nThe 12th-century gilded reliquary chest in the Basilica of Saint Servatius, containing the saint's relics, is a major work of Mosan art and became known as the 'Chest of Distress' (Dutch: \"Noodkist\") as it was carried around town in times of distress. A pilgrimage with the relics of Saint Servatius and other saints takes place every seven years: the Maastricht Pilgrimage of the Relics (Dutch: \"Heiligdomsvaart\"). The \"Noodkist\" is normally kept in the Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius, along with the so-called 'Servatiana' (objects that are associated with the saint, such as his pilgrim's staff, his crozier, his pectoral cross, his chalice, his paten and a symbolic key to heaven).\n\nOther historic churches in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany were dedicated to the saint, e.g. the collegiate churches of Grimbergen Abbey and Quedlinburg Abbey. In the Quedlinburg Treasury important relics of Saint Servatius are kept. In many churches around the world, reliquaries, statues, stained glass windows, altar pieces and paintings of Servatius are revered. St. Servatius Church in Kampung Sawah, Indonesia received the relics of Servatius from Maastricht in its establishment date on October 6, 1996. Since then, highly infused by Betawi culture, the festival honoring the relics has been celebrated annually by the parishioners of the church.\n\nA mid-15th-century wooden sculpture of Memelia (the ancestor linking Servatius to Jesus) with the infant Servatius in her arms (identifiable by the infant wearing a bishop's mitre) in the Vendsyssel Historiske Museum in Hjørring, Denmark, is iconographically so similar to sculptures of the Madonna and Child, that it was long misattributed.\n\nIn Sri Lanka , St. Servatius' College was built around 1897 by a Belgian priest, Father Augustus Standard, on the bank of the river Nilwala at Pallimulla, Matara. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964488", "title": "Bradford Cathedral", "text": "Bradford Cathedral\n\nBradford Cathedral (Cathedral church of St Peter) is a cathedral in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, which is built on a site used for Christian worship since the 8th century, when missionaries based in Dewsbury evangelised the area. Until 1919, it was the parish church of St Peter.\n\nThe first church on the site was built in Anglo-Saxon times and fell into ruin during the Norman Invasion in 1066. The Norman Lady of the Manor, Alice de Laci, built a second church that three hundred years later would be destroyed by raiding Scots.\n\nDuring the 14th century the church was rebuilt and some of the older masonry may have been used in the reconstruction of the nave. The nave arcades, the oldest parts of the present building, were completed in 1458. A clerestory above them was added by the end of the 15th century. Chantry chapels were founded, on the north side of the chancel by the Leventhorpe family, and on the south by the owners of Bolling Hall. The tower in the Perpendicular style was added to the west end and finished in 1508. In 1854 Robert Mawer carved a new reredos in Caen stone for the church. There is a photograph of it in the church archive. This reredos was lost during the 1950s rebuild by Edward Maufe.\n\nOriginally in the Diocese of York, the church was in the Diocese of Ripon before becoming a cathedral in 1919, when the Diocese of Bradford was created; it became one of three co-equal cathedrals of the new Diocese of Leeds upon its creation on 20 April 2014.\n\nThe building was extended in the 1950s and 1960s by Edward Maufe. The east end of the Cathedral (shown in the photo) is Maufe's work, but he reused the Morris & Co. stained glass from the old east window—there is therefore Victorian stained glass throughout the building including at the west end a window showing the women of the Bible. The many wall monuments include a sculpture by John Flaxman. Maufe also extended the west of the Cathedral on either side of the tower.\n\nIn 1987 the nave and west end were re-ordered so as to provide the setting and amenities needed for the increasing number of visitors and the many varied occasions when large numbers of people come to the Cathedral. New entrances were made through the tower walls to the offices and Song Room. The roof panelling was cleaned and restored and new lighting was installed.\nTo enable flexibility of use the Victorian pews were replaced by chairs. The nave organ was removed to give more light and space at the west end, and a Bradford Computer Organ was installed, complementing the pipe organ in the choir with loudspeakers in the nave.\n\nThe hassocks were embroidered by people from many parishes in the Diocese. They depict Christian symbols and also a woolsack and the White Rose of York. The finest embroidery is seen on the cushions in the Sanctuary and the Choir.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, the cathedral authorities decided to develop a museum of religion in St Peter's House (built in the 19th century as Bradford's main Post Office). The visitor numbers were much lower than expected and the project collapsed leaving the cathedral in debt, from which it was discharged in 2007. St Peter's House is now owned by a South Asian arts group, Kala Sangam.\n\nThe cathedral is set in a small conservation area which includes the close to its north. The close provides modern housing for the Dean and Canons Residentiary, the Bishop's official residence, \"Bishopcroft\", being in Heaton, approximately from the city centre.\n\nThe cathedral and its predecessors were built on the shelf of alluvial land that had formed on the outside of the bend where Bradford Beck turns north, but the town grew up on the lower ground on the other side of the beck, so the church was always just outside the centre of town. In the 19th and 20th centuries the cathedral was partly hidden from the centre by buildings, first by the Post Office just below it, and subsequently by the 1960s developments of Forster Square and Petergate. The latter areas were demolished in 2006, and leaving the cathedral more visible than for many years prior to the completion of the Broadway Centre in 2015.\n\nAs of 21 December 2018:\n\nBradford Cathedral has long been a place of music.\nDuring term-time, Choral Services are sung as follows:\nSunday 10.15 am Choral Eucharist (rotates girls/adults, boys/adults or Cathedral Consort);\nSunday 4.00 pm Choral Evensong (rotates boys/adults, girls/adults or Lay Clerks);\nMonday 5.45 pm Choral Evensong (girls and adults);\nTuesday 5.45 pm Choral Evensong (boys and adults);\nThursday 5.45 pm Choral Evensong (girls or boys, alternating weekly).\n\nThe boys and girls of the Choir sing as separate top lines and are drawn from as many as 20 local schools at any time. New entrants spend a couple of terms as a probationer, receiving basic training in singing and musicianship, before progressing to full membership. Full Choristers have the opportunity to take up individual, free-of-charge tuition in singing, musicianship, theory or piano on a 1:1 basis each week. The lay clerks of the Choir are highly skilled volunteers, most of whom make their living outside of music. In September 2015 residential choral scholarships were introduced. The Cathedral Consort, a high standard chamber choir consisting of adult sopranos and lay clerks, completes the Choral Foundation.\n\nIn addition to the schedule above, the Choir also performs other concerts and services within and outside the diocese. Although foreign tours have been undertaken, the most recent being to Barcelona in 2010 and Bavaria in 2008, touring more recently has been within the UK, with the girls and boys each undertaking a residential tour annually, with or without the choir adults. Tours have been undertaken in recent years to Bristol, Worcester, Edinburgh and Durham.\n\nThe girls and men are involved with the annual Yorkshire Cathedrals' Girls' Choirs' Festival and hosted the Festal Evensong in March 2015. The boy choristers had not been involved with the Yorkshire Three Choirs Festival since 1981, but with the recent renaissance of an independent boys' top-line at the Cathedral they, along with the lay clerks, were re-included in this annual festival from October 2015. Bradford Cathedral hosted the Festival in October 2016.\n\nIn July 2012, the Choir recorded two services for the BBC Radio 2 Sunday Half Hour programme, which were broadcast in Autumn 2012, and the girls and men sang live for BBC Radio 4 Sunday Worship in December 2012. The Choir recorded a CD of Evening Canticles, including Humphrey Clucas's 'Bradford Service' in November 2013, and February 2014 saw the Choir recording two programmes of BBC Songs of Praise, airing on 2 March 2014 and Palm Sunday, 13 April 2014. Since 2015, the Choir has performed annually with the European Union Chamber Orchestra, singing Vivaldi's \"Gloria\", Haydn's \"Little Organ Mass\", and Schubert's \"Mass No. 2 in G major\".\n\nA specification of the William Hill pipe organ, with later modifications by Hill, Norman & Beard (1961) and J. W. Walker (1977) can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. A flourishing series of Organ Recitals takes place on many Wednesday lunchtimes throughout the year at 1.00pm, attracting many well-known players. An Organ Appeal was launched in February 2013, aiming to raise £250,000 over several years, in order to secure the continued reliability of the instrument, as well as making possible several tonal adjustments. A. J. Carter of Wakefield and Andrew Cooper are working in conjunction to carry out this work on a phased basis over the coming years. The first phase, entailing the substantial upgrading of the console, was carried out in October 2014. The second phase, to clean, revoice and extend the Chancel (Positive) Division, was completed in the first half of 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is a regular bus service along this road, linking the village to the regional centres of Lanjarón and Órgiva as well as the provincial capital, Granada.\n\nTrevélez is famous for the quality of its air-cured hams, a speciality throughout the Alpujarras but particularly associated with the village, because the dry climate due to its altitude makes for ideal conditions for storing them.\n\nTrevélez celebrates the day of the \"Virgen de Las Nieves\" (Virgin of the Snows - see article in external links) in the summer months. On this day the virgin is carried to the summit of Mulhacén and a mass is celebrated. The traditional belief is that this will keep travellers safe in the Sierra Nevada for another year.\n\n"}

All the ParaHox genes in the amphioxus genome are therefore in the ParaHox gene cluster. In contrast, the human genome has six ParaHox genes (GSX1, GSX2, PDX1, CDX1, CDX2, CDX4), of which three genes (GSX1, PDX1 (=IPF1), CDX2) are physically linked to form a human ParaHox gene cluster on chromosome 13. Mouse has a homologous ParaHox gene cluster on chromosome 5. The other three human ParaHox genes are remnants from duplicated ParaHox gene clusters that were generated in the 2R genome duplications at the base of vertebrate evolution. Some vertebrates, notably chondrichthyan fish and coelacanths, have retained an additional ParaHox gene (PDX2).\n\nThe ParaHox gene cluster has been proposed to be a paralogue, or evolutionary sister, of the Hox gene cluster; the two gene clusters being descendent from a segmental duplication early in animal evolution, preceding the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterian animals. It has been suggested that an ancient role of the ParaHox gene cluster in bilaterians was the specify or pattern the through-gut, with Gsx patterning the mouth, Xlox (=Pdx) patterning the midgut and Cdx marking the anus. Gene expression and functional data lends tentative support to this hypothesis, although in many animals the roles of the genes have changed in evolution, notably the Gsx gene family which plays a role in brain (not foregut) development in vertebrates.\n\n"}

Rock Paper Scissors Island!!\", all of which have a gag aspect of manga, usually using satire and visual gags. Not too long after beginning to work for \"Shōnen Jump\", Sawai began experimenting with various concepts regarding characters who fought with bizarre bodily functions, including a hero who fought with farts and a poop-headed hero. His most successful experiment was a \"Fist of the North Star\" parody involving a strange afro-haired man who fought against \"Hair Hunters\" using his nose hairs in a post-apocalyptic society. The character, as well as the story itself, was \"Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo\". Over several one-shots, Sawai further defined Bo-bobo as well as introducing other characters, including damsel-in-distress Beauty, fellow nosehair fighter Gunkan (Captain Battleship), rival fart-fighter Heppokomaru (Gasser), and a strange star-shaped creature and fellow \"Hajikelist\" known as Don Patch. After the success of these one-shots, Bo-bobo became a weekly series in 2001, where it had a long and successful run until its conclusion in 2007.\n\nSawai's art style is a mix of very blocky-looking characters and, sometimes, very detailed art. He tends to focus on the realistic appearance of his characters' facial expressions when they freak out. Because of the nature of his series, he has often written Bo-bobo version parodies of other authors' manga, including Akira Toriyama's \"Dragon Ball\", Yudetamago's \"Kinnikuman\", Kazuki Takahashi's \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\", and Tsugumi Ohba's and Takeshi Obata's \"Death Note\". He was also the leader of a team of gag-based manga artists (alongside Kyosuke Usuta, Amon Dai and Kouji Ooishi) who wrote a special 30th anniversary chapter of Osamu Akimoto's \"Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo\".

{"id": "1964524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964524", "title": "Tony Rickardsson", "text": "Tony Rickardsson\n\nTony Rickardsson (born on 17 August 1970) is a Swedish former professional motorcycle speedway rider. He competed in the Speedway World Championships from 1989 to 2006. Rickardsson is notable for winning six Speedway World Championship titles in 15 attempts. He most recently rode for Masarna from Avesta in the Swedish Elitserien league, Unia Tarnów in the Polish Ekstraliga and for the Ipswich Witches, Poole Pirates, King's Lynn Stars, Arena-Essex Hammers and Oxford Cheetahs in the British Elite League. In 2011, Rickardsson was named an FIM Legend for his motorcycling achievements.\n\nRickardsson was born in Avesta, Dalarna County, Sweden. In 1989 he became Swedish team champion with the now defunct Stockholm U team. The next year, he won the Swedish Championship, a title he's won six times since, including three times in a row from 1997 to 1999. That year, he also won a bronze medal at the Junior World Championships in Lviv. In 1991, he made his debut at the World Championship in Gothenburg, and surprised many by winning silver behind diminutive Dane Jan O. Pedersen. Rickardsson was lucky to actually make the 1991 World Final after having missed qualifying when he finished 10th in the Nordic Final in Denmark, but got his chance when as first reserve he replaced injured English rider Andy Smith for the World Semi-final in Germany and ended up finishing a strong 5th to qualify for the Final.\n\nThis promising performance was followed up by two fourteenth-places at the next World Championship, before he won the last single-event World Championships in an extra play-off race against Danish triple World Champion Hans Nielsen and Australian Craig Boyce. In 1993 he won the Speedway World Pairs Championship with Per Jonsson and Henrik Gustafsson. He also won the 1992 and 1994 World Team Cup Championships as a member of the powerful Swedish teams which included 1990 World Champion Per Jonsson, Henrik Gustafsson, 1988 World Under-21 champ Peter Nahlin, Jimmy Nilsen and Mikael Karlsson.\n\nDespite being on or near the top of the tables in the new Speedway Grand Prix series, organised as six events where points were tallied at the end, Rickardsson failed to win a single individual Grand Prix event in the next three years, and only won a World Championship silver and a Swedish Championship in that time. However, from 1998 onwards, he was dominant. He won three of six events in 1998, including a home win in Linköping, and ended up beating fellow Swede Jimmy Nilsen by 12 points. Joining Hans Nielsen as the only 2 riders to have won world titles in both the single meeting and grand prix formats. This year, he also won the Elitserien with Valsarna of Hagfors, being the highest averaging rider that season, and he won the British Elite League with Ipswich, averaging the highest for them as well. 1999 was an almost equally stunning season, although it started badly when he got disqualified in the first race at Prague, finishing eleventh. After three races, he was third, 24 points behind Tomasz Gollob, who looked to be cruising to victory. However, Gollob ran into trouble in the fourth race at Coventry, being forced to retire after the introductory stages and finishing eighth, meaning that Rickardsson caught up 15 points in one race. With one event left at Vojens, Gollob still led by four points, but in a quarter-final heat where Ryan Sullivan had been excluded and he only had to finish in the top two to qualify for the semi-final, Gollob finished third, and the pressure was off Rickardsson - who would now win if he finished in the top six. This recovery gave him Swedish sport's arguably greatest award, Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal (lit.: The Achievement Medal), for the best achievement of the year.\n\nRickardsson continued to win titles throughout the new century, although Mark Loram won the 2000 World Championship despite not winning a single event. Rickardsson won one - at Wrocław, but was too inconsistent to win the overall title. However, he again won the Elitserien, this time with his local team Masarna from Avesta, as he and team-mate Leigh Adams were the two highest averaging riders in the entire league. In 2001 he was back on the World stage, winning the World title with a record 121 points from six Grand Prix events, only missing one final - the last, at home on Stockholms Stadion, which was really academic as only a thirteenth place could possibly have robbed him of the title. He managed to win at home in the next Grand Prix series in 2002, which gave him three individual wins as he won his fifth World Championship. In 2003, he finished third overall. Thirteenth place finishes in Gothenburg, Bydgoszcz and Vikingskipet at Hamar ruining his bid for the title, and a concussion kept him out of the Swedish team that won the World Cup at Vojens (though he was part of a qualifier race and hence stands with a World Cup medal - his only title that year). The following year he managed to win the Swedish Championship at Målilla, but consistency eluded him as Jason Crump pipped him to the World title by three points (although the lead was 17 points before the final race). He followed this up with another extremely strong season in 2005. With 6 First positions at Wrocław (1st Event), Krško (3rd), Millennium Stadium (4th), Idrætsparken (5th) in Copenhagen, Prage (6th) and Lonigo (9th); a second in the Swedish event at Eskilstuna (2nd); third in the Scandinavian held in Målilla (7th) and a lowly 9th in the Polish Grand Prix held at Bydgoszcz (8th Event). Even with such a poor finish in Poland, however, he had already virtually sown up the Championship in the 7th Grand Prix in Målilla, ahead of Jason Crump. After the sixth event held in the Czech Republic, he was first in the points per event table of the Elitserien (the Swedish Domestic Elite League). Though Tony stated that he would give up racing after the 2006 season, he announced his early retirement from both World Championship and Domestic Speedway on 1 August 2006 at a press conference in Stockholm, in order to pursue his interest in racing cars instead. Rickardsson was a contestant on the TV4 television show \"Let's Dance 2008\" in which he finished 2nd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1964536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964536", "title": "Siege of Toulon", "text": "Siege of Toulon\n\nThe Siege of Toulon (29 August – 19 December 1793) was a military operation by Republican forces against a Royalist rebellion in the southern French city of Toulon during the Federalist revolts.\n\nAfter the arrest of the Girondist deputies on the 2 June 1793, there followed a series of insurrections within the French cities of Lyon, Avignon, Nîmes and Marseille known as Federalist revolts. In Toulon, the revolutionaries evicted the existing Jacobin faction but were soon supplanted by the more numerous royalists. Upon the announcement of the recapture of Marseille and of the reprisals which had taken place there at the hands of the revolutionaries, the royalist forces, directed by the Baron d'Imbert, requested support from the Anglo-Spanish fleet. On the twenty-eighth of August, the British and Spanish commanders of the fleet, Admiral Sir Samuel Hood (Royal Navy) and Admiral Juan de Lángara (Spanish Navy), responded with 13,000 troops of British, Spanish, Neapolitan and Piedmontese origin. Baron d'Imbert delivered the port of Toulon to the British navy. Toulon hoisted the royal flag, the fleur de lys, and d'Imbert declared the eight-year-old Louis XVII king of France on the first of October. This result produced a potentially mortal situation for the French republic, as the city had a key naval arsenal and was the base for 26 ships of the line (about one third of the total available to the French Navy). Without this port there was little chance for French naval ambitions. As a result, any desire to challenge the Allies, and specifically the British, for control of the seas would be out of the question. In addition, its loss would send a dangerous signal to others preparing to revolt against the republic. \n\nThe troops of the army said to be of the \"Carmagnoles\", under the command of General Jean François Carteaux, arrived at Toulon on 8 September, after those troops had recovered Avignon and Marseille, and then Ollioules. They joined up with the 6,000 men of the Alpine Maritime Army, commanded by General Jean François Cornu de La Poype, who had just taken La Valette-du-Var, and sought to take the forts of Mont Faron, which dominated the city to the East. They were reinforced by 3,000 sailors under the orders of Admiral de Saint Julien, who refused to serve the British with his chief, Trogoff. A further 5,000 soldiers under General La Poype were attached to the army to retake Toulon from the Army of Italy.\nThe Chief of Artillery, commander Elzéar Auguste de Dommartin, having been wounded at Ollioules, had the young captain Napoleon Bonaparte imposed upon him by the special representatives of the Convention and Napoleon's friends —Augustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti. Bonaparte had been in the area escorting a convoy of powder wagons en route to Nice and had stopped in to pay his respects to his fellow Corsican, Saliceti. Bonaparte had been present in the army since the Avignon insurrection (July, 1793), and was imposed on Dommartin in this way despite the mutual antipathy between the two men.\nDespite the mutual dislike between Bonaparte and the chief of artillery, the young artillery officer was able to muster an artillery force that was worthy of a siege of Toulon and the fortresses that were quickly built by the British in its immediate environs. He was able to requisition equipment and cannon from the surrounding area. Guns were taken from Marseille, Avignon and the Army of Italy. The local populace, which was eager to prove its loyalty to the republic which it had recently rebelled against, was blackmailed into supplying the besieging force with animals and supplies. His activity resulted in the acquisition of 100 guns for the force. With the help of his friends, the deputies Saliceti and Augustin Robespierre, who held power of life and death, he was able to compel retired artillery officers from the area to re-enlist. The problem of manning the guns was not remedied by this solution alone, and under Bonaparte's intensive training he instructed much of the infantry in the practice of employing, deploying and firing the artillery that his efforts had recently acquired.\nHowever, in spite of this effort, Bonaparte was not as confident about this operation as was later his custom. The officers serving with him in the siege were incompetent, and he was becoming concerned about the needless delays due to these officers' mistakes. He was so concerned that he wrote a letter of appeal to the Committee of Public Safety requesting assistance. To deal with his superiors who were wanting in skill, he proposed the appointment of a general for command of the artillery, succeeding himself, so that \"... (they could) command respect and deal with a crowd of fools on the staff with whom one has constantly to argue and lay down the law in order to overcome their prejudices and make them take steps which theory and practice alike have shown to be axiomatic to any trained officer of this corps\".\n\nAfter some reconnaissance, Bonaparte conceived a plan which envisaged the capture of the forts of l'Eguillette and Balaguier, on the hill of Cairo, which would then prevent passage between the small and large harbours of the port, so cutting maritime resupply, necessary for those under siege. Carteaux, reluctant, sent only a weak detachment under Major General Delaborde, which failed in its attempted conquest on 22 September. The allies now alerted, built \"Fort Mulgrave\", so christened in honour of the British commander, Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, on the summit of the hill. It was supported by three smaller ones, called Saint-Phillipe, Saint-Côme, and Saint-Charles. The apparently impregnable collection was nicknamed, by the French, \"Little Gibraltar\".\n\nBonaparte was dissatisfied by the sole battery—called the \"Mountain\", positioned on the height of Saint-Laurent since 19 September. He established another, on the shore of Brégallion, called the \"\"sans-culottes\"\". Hood attempted to silence it, without success, but the British fleet was obliged to harden its resolve along the coast anew, because of the high seabed of Mourillon and la Tour Royale. On the first of October, after the failure of General La Poype against the \"Eastern Fort\" of Faron, Bonaparte was asked to bombard the large fort of Malbousquet, whose fall would be required to enable the capture of the city. He therefore requisitioned artillery from all of the surrounding countryside, holding the power of fifty batteries of six cannon apiece. Promoted to Chief of Battalion on 19 October, he organised a grand battery, said to be \"of the Convention\", on the hill of Arènes and facing the fort, supported by those of the \"Camp of the Republicans\" on the hill of Dumonceau, by those of the \"Farinière\" on the hill of Gaux, and those of the \"Poudrière\" at Lagoubran.\n\nOn 11 November, Carteaux was dismissed and replaced by Doppet, formerly a doctor, whose indecision would cause an attempted surprise against Fort Mulgrave to fail on the 16th. Aware of his own incompetence, he resigned. He was succeeded by a career soldier, Dugommier, who immediately recognized the virtue of Bonaparte's plan, and prepared for the capture of Little Gibraltar. On the 20th, as soon as he arrived, the battery \"Jacobins\" was established, on the ridge of l'Evescat. Then, on the left, on 28 November, the battery of the \"Men Without Fear\", and then on 14 December, the \"Chasse Coquins\" were constructed between the two. Two other batteries were organized to repel the eventual intervention of the allied ships, they were called \"The Great Harbour\" and the \"Four Windmills\".\n\nPressured by the bombardment, the Anglo-Neapolitans executed a sortie, and took hold of the battery of the \"Convention\". A counter-attack, headed by Dugommier and Bonaparte, pushed them back and the British general, Charles O'Hara, was captured. He initiated surrender negotiations with Robespierre the Younger and Antoine Louis Albitte and the Federalist and Royalist battalions were disarmed.\n\nFollowing O'Hara's capture, Dugommier, La Poype, and Bonaparte (now a colonel) launched a general assault during the night of 16 December. Around midnight, the assault began on Little Gibraltar and the fighting continued all night. Bonaparte was injured in the thigh by a British sergeant with a bayonet. However, in the morning, the position having been taken, Marmont was able to place artillery there, against l'Eguillette and Balaguier, which the British had evacuated without confrontation on the same day. During this time, La Poype finally was able to take the forts of Faron and Malbousquet. The allies then decided to evacuate by their maritime route. Commodore Sydney Smith was instructed by Hood to have the delivery fleet and the arsenal burnt.\n\nLángara ordered Don Pedro Cotiella to take three boats into the arsenal to destroy the French fleet. Sir Sidney Smith, who had recently arrived, volunteered to accompany him with his ship \"Swallow\" and three British boats. Cotiella was tasked with sinking Toulon's powder hulks; one was a disarmed former British frigate captured during the American Revolutionary War, \"Montréal\", and the other was the French frigate \"Iris\". These ships contained the gunpowder stores for the entire fleet and due to the danger of explosion were anchored in the outer roads, some distance from the city. He was then instructed to enter the Old Arsenal and destroy the ships there. The dock gates, which had been barred against attack and manned by 800 former galley slaves freed during the retreat. Their sympathies were with the advancing Republicans so to ensure that they did not interfere, Smith kept his guns trained on them throughout the operation. His boats were spotted by the Republican batteries on the heights and cannonballs and shells landed in the arsenal, although none struck Smith's men. As darkness fell Republican troops reached the shoreline and contributed musketry to the fusillade; Smith replied with grape shot from his boat's guns.\nAt 20:00 Captain Charles Hare brought the fireship HMS \"Vulcan\" into the New Arsenal. Smith halted the ship across the row of anchored French ships of the line, and lit the fuses at 22:00. Hare was badly wounded by an early detonation as he attempted to leave his ship. Simultaneously, fire parties set alight the warehouses and stores ashore, including the mast house and the hemp and timber stores, creating an inferno across the harbour as \"Vulcan\"s cannons fired a last salvo at the French positions on the shore. With the fires spreading through the dockyards and New Arsenal, Smith began to withdraw. His force was illuminated by the flames, making an inviting target for the Republican batteries. As his boats passed the \"Iris\" however the powder ship suddenly and unexpectedly exploded, blasting debris in a wide circle and sinking two of the British boats. On \"Britannia\" all of the crew survived, but the blast killed the master and three men on \"Union\".\n\nWith the New Arsenal in flames, Smith realised that the Old Arsenal appeared intact; only a few small fires marked the Spanish effort to destroy the French ships anchored within. He immediately led \"Swallow\" back towards the arsenal but found that Republican soldiers had captured it intact, their heavy musketry driving him back. Instead he turned to two disarmed ships of the line, \"Héros\" and \"Thémistocle\", which lay in the inner roads as prison hulks. The French Republican prisoners on board had initially resisted British efforts to burn the ships, but with the evidence of the destruction in\n\nWith all the available targets on fire or in French hands, Smith withdrew once more, accompanied by dozens of small watercraft packed with Toulonnais refugees and Neapolitan soldiers separated during the retreat. As he passed the second powder hulk, \"Montréal\", she also exploded unexpectedly. Although his force was well within the blast radius, on this occasion none of Smith's men were struck by falling debris and his boats retired to the waiting British fleet without further incident. As Smith's boats had gone about their work Hood had ordered HMS \"Robust\" under Captain George Elphinstone and HMS \"Leviathan\" under Captain Benjamin Hallowell to evacuate the allied troops from the waterfront. They were joined by HMS \"Courageux\" under Captain William Waldegrave, which had been undergoing repairs in the Arsenal to replace a damaged rudder. Despite this handicap, \"Courageux\" was able to participate in the evacuation and warp out of the harbour with the replacement rudder following behind, suspended between two ship's boats. The fireship HMS \"Conflagration\", also undergoing repairs, was unable to sail and was destroyed during the evacuation. By the morning of 19 December Elphinstone's squadron had retrieved all of the Allied soldiers from the city without losing a single man.\n\nIn addition to the soldiery, the British squadron and their boats took on board thousands of French Royalist refugees, who had flocked to the waterfront when it became clear that the city would fall to the Republicans. \"Robust\", the last to leave, carried more than 3,000 civilians from the harbour and another 4,000 were recorded on board \"Princess Royal\" out in the roads. In total the British fleet rescued 14,877 Toulonnais from the city; witnesses on board the retreating ships reported scenes of panic on the waterfront as stampeding civilians were crushed or drowned in their haste to escape the advancing Republican soldiers, who fired indiscriminately into the fleeing populace.\n\nThe troops of the Convention entered the city on 19 December. The subsequent suppression of Royalists, directed by Paul Barras and Stanislas Fréron, was extremely bloody. It is estimated that between 700 and 800 prisoners were shot or slain by bayonet on Toulon's Champ de Mars. Bonaparte, treated for his injuries by Jean François Hernandez, was not present at the massacre. Promoted to Brigadier General on 22 December, he was already on his way to his new post in Nice as the artillery commander for the Italian Army.

Novator Partners and General Catalyst had previously collectively owned a majority stake in the company, and in September 2018, CCP was acquired by South Korean video game publisher Pearl Abyss for $425 million. CCP Games is best known for developing \"Eve Online\", which was released in 2003 and has since been maintained.\n\nCCP Games was founded in June 1997 by Reynir Harðarson, Þórólfur Beck Kristjónsson and Ívar Kristjánsson for the purpose of making MMORPGs. The name \"CCP\" is short for \"Crowd Control Productions\". To finance the initial development of \"Eve Online\", CCP Games developed and published a board game, called \"Hættuspil\" (\"\"Danger Game\"\"). The game sold more than 10,000 copies to Iceland's 80,000 households. In April 2000 the company, with Sigurður Arnljótsson as CEO, raised $2.6 million, through a closed offering organised by Kaupthing Bank, from private investors in Iceland, including the Icelandic telephone company Síminn. He was with the company from 1999 to 2002 during which time the company raised two rounds of financing and secured a contract with publisher Simon & Schuster. Approximately half of the initial 21 employees came from Icelandic dot-com company OZ Interactive.\n\nOn 11 November 2006, it was announced that CCP Games had entered a merger agreement with White Wolf Publishing. With the merge, the combined company planned to produce \"the industry's most innovative games leveraging both online and offline systems\". While CCP Games looked into creating online games based on White Wolf Publishing's properties, White Wolf Publishing would in turn create card games based on \"Eve Online\". On 3 October 2007, CCP Games announced that CCP North America, a new video game-focused subsidiary, would be setup within White Wolf Publishing's Stone Mountain, Georgia location on 12 October, hiring 100 developers. White Wolf Publishing president Mike Tinney was additionally promoted head of CCP North America. In February 2011, CCP Games announced that intentions to expand the location from their presently 150 positions to 300, and move the studio to new housing in Decatur, Georgia. However, when CCP Games let go 20% of their worldwide staff, most of these layoffs occurred at CCP North America. On 27 February 2012, Tinney stated that he had departed from both operations to focus on his new gaming-and-health startup, UtiliFIT. In December 2013, further 15 people from the \"World of Darkness Online\" development team were let go. White Wolf Publishing was acquired by Paradox Interactive on 29 October 2015. The deal comprised an undisclosed all-cash sum for CCP Games, and the company assets of White Wolf Publishing, their intellectual property and the rights to \"World of Darkness Online\" for Paradox Interactive.\n\nIn late 2011 CCP Games released an announcement to its community admitting that they had made a mistake by releasing the Incarna expansion in its current development stage. In the wake of the Incarna expansion and following a mass protest by \"EVE Online\" players, CCP Games announced that it had decided to prioritise and shift their focus from their \"World of Darkness\" MMO back to their \"EVE\"-Universe products, \"EVE Online\" and \"Dust 514\". The restructuring resulted in the layoffs of 20% of CCP Games' staff worldwide. The majority of these layoffs affected the Atlanta, United States, office, but also affected were several positions in CCP headquarters in Reykjavík, Iceland. Even though after considerable downsizing, CCP Games claims that \"EVE Online\" and its development is stronger than ever and that the company will continue to grow. CCP Games confirmed that they had moved away from the Incarna/Ambulation project to focus on the core game mechanics and that Incarna may be revisited further down the line.\n\nIn October 2011, following a large controversy over its introduction of microtransactions to the game \"EVE Online\", CCP Games announced that it would be reducing its staff. As stated in a CCP Games press release, the layoffs affected about 20% of all worldwide jobs within CCP Games, most in their Atlanta office. These layoffs were mainly of staff related to the development of \"World of Darkness Online\".\n\nOn 28 August 2014, CCP Games shut down its San Francisco studio to refocus their efforts on \"EVE Online\". At the same time, CFO Joe Gallo and CMO David Reid resigned. As of 2015, none of CCP Games' original founders were still with the company.\n\nOn 30 October 2017, CCP Games announced it would shutter its Atlanta studio, and sell off its Newcastle studio, affecting approximately 100 employees. It announced that it would shift its focus from VR development to PC and mobile game development.\n\nPearl Abyss, the South Korean publisher of \"Black Desert Online\", announced on 6 September 2018 that they had agreed to acquire CCP Games for about . CCP's development studios in Reykjavik, London, and Shanghai would continue under CCP Games, while the publishing and marketing functions of CCP would be integrated with Pearl Abyss. The deal is expected to close on 12 October. At the time, CCP Games had 250 employees across three development studios.\n\n\"EVE Online\" is CCP Games' first video game, originally published by Simon & Schuster in May 2003. CCP Games later reacquired the rights to publish \"EVE Online\" and continues to manage it to this day. \"EVE Online\"'s core gameplay revolves around player decisions around mining, exploration, industry, factional warfare and piracy. A major design choice is the freedom to do what would be illegal activities, such as scamming for in-game items.\n\nOn 18 August 2009, Hilmar Veigar Pétursson announced \"Dust 514\", a new ground-based first-person shooter (FPS) with real-time strategy elements being developed by CCP Games' Shanghai office. \"Dust 514\" was released for the PlayStation 3 on 14 May 2013. It features a core first-person shooter experience, with a high level of customisation. The game was shut down by CCP Games on 30 May 2016.\n\n\"Eve: Valkyrie\" is a first-person space combat simulator set in the \"EVE Online\" universe for the Oculus Rift on 28 March 2016 and on PlayStation VR on 13 October 2016. It was made available for the HTC Vive on 17 November 2016. In the game, players take the role of an immortal fighter pilot, fighting with teams of other pilots to capture objectives and to defeat the opposing team. As of 26 September 2017, \"Eve: Valkyrie\" can be played without VR.\n\n\"Gunjack\" is a virtual-reality arcade shooter released for the Samsung Gear VR on 20 November 2015, the Oculus Rift on 28 March 2016, and the HTC Vive on 5 April 2016. A PlayStation VR version is planned for release in 2016. Players take the role of a turret operator defending a mining operation, set in the \"EVE Online\" universe. It gathered positive critical reviews on release.\n\n\"Gunjack 2: End of Shift\" is a virtual-reality arcade shooter released for Google Daydream on 8 December 2016. Players take the role of a turret operator defending a mining operation, set in the \"EVE Online\" universe.\n\n\"Sparc\" is a virtual reality sports game and was CCP Games' first non-\"Eve\" title. The game was announced on 27 February 2016.\n\nIn October 2006, CCP Games chief marketing officer, Magnús Bergsson, stated that \"Eve\" would not be the only game to come out of CCP Games. On 11 November 2006 CCP Games and White Wolf Publishing jointly announced that CCP Games would be working on a \"World of Darkness Online\". CCP Games planned to focus on the development of this game from March 2009 onward. It was scheduled to launch in 2012 at the earliest, but due to problems in \"EVE Online\", several layoffs in 2011 and the planned release of the PlayStation 3 FPS game \"Dust 514\" in the summer of 2013, the launch of the game was delayed indefinitely. On 14 April 2014, CCP Games announced that the game had been cancelled.\n\n\"Project Legion\" was set to be a first-person shooter for similar to \"Dust 514\". The project was cancelled in 2015 and was replaced with \"Project Nova\".\n\n\"Eve: The Second Genesis\" is a collectible card game set in the universe created for the online game \"EVE Online\". Each player represents a CEO of a corporation, aligned with a particular race, and through exploration, mining, and military strength, their goal is to defeat opponent CEOs.\n\n\"Project Nova\" is a class-based first-person shooter (FPS) for the PC taking place in the \"EVE Online\" universe and was in development by CCP Games Shanghai. Project Nova was created on Unreal Engine 4 and they intended to focus on the competitive FPS feel as well as focus more on space combat and less on planet combat which is a different focus than \"Dust 514\". Project Nova was replaced by a now unannounced third-person shooter as of February 2020.\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1953 to 1958, initially as a Social Credit representative and later as an independent.\n\nThe son of Adrian Henry Bullmore and Annie Andrew, Bullmore was educated in Minnedosa, and worked as a manufacturer. He was the president of Dauphin Products Ltd. and also established the Bullmore Funeral Home. He married Arla Maynes, from Harrowby, Manitoba, on August 11, 1936 and they had two children, who were named James William Bullmore and Arla Anne Bullmore Porter. He served in Dauphin as a Councillor from 1944 to 1945, and was the town's mayor from 1946 to 1955. He was the first president of the Manitoba Urban League. Bullmore was also an active freemason, and was involved with several masonic organizations.\n\nBullmore's decision to run for the Social Credit Party was a surprise to many political observers, as he had been encouraged by some members of the Liberal Party to run federally under their banner. In his nomination speech, he acknowledged that some of his friends had warned him against running for Social Credit, suggesting it would be \"political suicide\".\n\nHe was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1953 election, defeating Liberal-Progressive candidate John Potoski by 174 votes in the Dauphin constituency. Incumbent Progressive Conservative Ernest N. McGirr finished third.\n\nBullmore was one of only two Social Credit MLAs to serve in Manitoba's 1953-58 parliament. According to the \"Winnipeg Free Press\", his early speeches in the legislature were focused on issues of monetary reform. He left the Social Credit Party in 1956 over contributions to the Social Credit Party from the Manitoba breweries. He did not seek re-election in the 1958 provincial election.\n\nBullmore moved to Winnipeg in 1958 and died there at the age of 59 following a lengthy illness.\n"}

It was released on May 10, 2005, through Merge Records in the US and Matador Records in Europe. It debuted at number 44 on the \"Billboard\" 200. \"I Turn My Camera On\" was released as a single, and has become one of the band's biggest hits to date. A deluxe reissue of the album was released on December 11, 2015 to commemorate its 10th anniversary.\n\nBritt Daniel began working on songs for Spoon's follow-up album to \"Kill the Moonlight\" in early 2003 when he received a letter from David Klowden in which he offered to let Daniel use his beach house if he wanted to \"go on another writing stint\". Daniel drove to Ocean Beach in San Diego and started writing songs for the next album in a small house that overlooked the ocean. He stayed there for a number of weeks and recalls working a lot but not feeling happy with the output of his work there.\n\nBefore the title \"Gimme Fiction\" was decided on, the album was going to be named \"The Beast and Dragon, Adored\" after the opening track, but Daniel later decided that he did not like this title. Daniel decided he wanted to use the word \"gimme\" in the title of the album and thought that \"Gimme Fiction\" was a great title for the artwork. He also has stated that the album cover is his favorite to date.\n\nThe title of the opening track, \"The Beast and Dragon, Adored\", came from an art magazine which Daniel found at his grandmother's house that contained a tapestry called \"The Apocalypse: The Beast and Dragon Are Adored\".\n\n\"Gimme Fiction\" received widespread critical acclaim upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on 30 reviews which indicates \"universal acclaim\". Eric Carr of \"Pitchfork\" praised the album's musical diversity and cited \"I Turn My Camera On\" as one of the most \"breathtaking\" songs the band had ever produced. Zeth Lundy of \"PopMatters\" named the album the band's \"crowning achievement\", while Jesus Chigley of \"Drowned in Sound\" described it as \"a nocturnal, introspective refinement of previous releases that still capitalises on Britt Daniel's classic pop song writing and sonic inventiveness.\"\n\nIn a 2005 back page column for the magazine \"Entertainment Weekly\", author Stephen King named \"I Summon You\" as his favorite song of the year.\n\nIn 2009, Rhapsody ranked the album at number 19 on its list of the 100 best albums of the decade. As of December 2009, \"Gimme Fiction\" has sold approximately 215,000 copies, according to Nielsen Soundscan. In his oral history of the album titled \"Gimme Facts\", writer Sean O'Neal named the album \"a historic forward leap\" for the band.\n\nOn November 3, 2015, it was announced that a deluxe edition of \"Gimme Fiction\" would be released on December 11, 2015 to commemorate the album's 10th anniversary. Joe Goggins of \"Drowned in Sound\", reviewing the re-issue, wrote: \"If ever there was a fork in the road for the group, this album was probably it; knowing, as we do with the benefit of hindsight, that they picked the right route, \"Gimme Fiction\" sounds even more invigorating on reflection.\" Barry Walters of \"Rolling Stone\" called it a \"transitional album that presaged 2007's pop breakthrough \"Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga\".\" \"GQ\" critic Miles Raymer dubbed \"Gimme Fiction\" \"the most important rock record of the last decade\".\n\n\nCredits adapted from liner notes for \"Gimme Fiction\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964571", "title": "Number needed to treat", "text": "Number needed to treat\n\nThe number needed to treat (NNT) is an epidemiological measure used in communicating the effectiveness of a health-care intervention, typically a treatment with medication. The NNT is the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome (e.g. the number of patients that need to be treated for one of them to benefit compared with a control in a clinical trial). It is defined as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction, and computed as formula_1, where formula_2 is the incidence in the treated (exposed) group, and formula_3 is the incidence in the control (unexposed) group. \n\nA type of effect size, the NNT was described in 1988 by McMaster University's Laupacis, Sackett and Roberts. The ideal NNT is 1, where everyone improves with treatment and no one improves with control. A higher NNT indicates that treatment is less effective.\n\nNNT is similar to number needed to harm (NNH), where NNT usually refers to a therapeutic intervention and NNH to a detrimental effect or risk factor.\n\nThe NNT is an important measure in pharmacoeconomics. If a clinical endpoint is devastating enough (\"e.g.\" death, heart attack), drugs with a high NNT may still be indicated in particular situations. If the endpoint is minor, health insurers may decline to reimburse drugs with a high NNT. NNT is significant to consider when comparing possible side effects of a medication against its benefits. For medications with a high NNT, even a small incidence of adverse effects may outweigh the benefits. Even though NNT is an important measure in a clinical trial, it is infrequently included in medical journal articles reporting the results of clinical trials. There are several important problems with the NNT, involving bias and lack of reliable confidence intervals, as well as difficulties in excluding the possibility of no difference between two treatments or groups.\n\nNNT values are time-specific. For example, if a study ran for 5 years and another ran for 1 year, the NNT values would not be directly comparable.\n\nThere are a number of factors that can affect the meaning of the NNT depending on the situation. The treatment may be a drug in the form of a pill or injection, a surgical procedure, or many other possibilities. The following examples demonstrate how NNT is determined and what it means. In this example, it is important to understand that every participant has the condition being treated, so there are only \"diseased\" patients who received the treatment or did not. This is typically a type of study that would occur only if both the control and the tested treatment carried significant risks of serious harm, or if the treatment was unethical for a healthy participant (for example, chemotherapy drugs or a new method of appendectomy - surgical removal of the appendix). Most drug trials test both the control and the treatment on both healthy and \"diseased\" participants. Or, if the treatment's purpose is to prevent a condition that is fairly common (an anticoagulant to prevent heart attack for example), a prospective study may be used. A study which starts with all healthy participants is termed a prospective study, and is in contrast to a retrospective study, in which some participants already have the condition in question. Prospective studies produce much higher quality evidence, but are much more difficult and time-consuming to perform.\n\nIn the table below:\n\nASCOT-LLA manufacturer-sponsored study addressed the benefit of atorvastatin 10 mg (a cholesterol-lowering drug) in patients with hypertension (high blood pressure) but no previous cardiovascular disease (primary prevention). The trial ran for 3.3 years, and during this period the relative risk of a \"primary event\" (heart attack) was reduced by 36% (relative risk reduction, RRR). The \"absolute\" risk reduction (ARR), however, was much smaller, because the study group did not have a very high rate of cardiovascular events over the study period: 2.67% in the control group, compared to 1.65% in the treatment group.

The Sigil of Baphomet first appeared on the cover of \"The Satanic Mass LP\" in 1968 and later on the cover of \"The Satanic Bible\" in 1969. The sigil has been called a \"material pentagram\" representational of carnality and earthy principles. The Church describes the symbol as the \"...preeminent visual distillation of the iconoclastic philosophy of Satanism.\"\n\nIn the literature and imagery predating LaVey, imagery used to represent the \"Satanic\" is denoted by inverted crosses and blasphemous parodies of Christian art. The familiar goat's head inside an inverted pentagram did not become the foremost symbol of Satanism until the founding of the Church of Satan in 1966. The original goat pentagram containing the Hebrew letters at the five points of the pentagram spelling out Leviathan (לויתן) first appeared in the book \"La Clef de la Magie Noire\" by French occultist Stanislas de Guaita, in 1897. This symbol was later used in Maurice Bessy's book \"A Pictorial History of Magic and the Supernatural\", with the words \"Samael\" and \"Lilith\" removed. During his years of research into the “black arts”, LaVey had come across this book and added it to his collection. When he chose to turn his magic circle, the Order of the Trapezoid, into the Church of Satan, he decided that the symbol was the one which most fully embodied the principles which were the bedrock of the Satanic church. Contrary to claims made against the Church by detractors, LaVey never claimed to have created this particular symbol. In its formative years, this particular version of the symbol was utilized by the Church on membership cards, stationary, medallions and most notably above the altar in the ritual chamber of the Black House. During the writing of \"The Satanic Bible\", it was decided that a unique version of the symbol should be rendered to be identified exclusively with the Church. The complete graphic now known as the \"Sigil of Baphomet\", named such for the first time in LaVey's \"The Satanic Rituals\", first appeared on the cover of \"The Satanic Mass LP\" in 1968 and later on the cover of \"The Satanic Bible\" in 1969. This version was drawn by LaVey and attributed to \"Hugo Zorilla\" (a pseudonym used by LaVey in some of his art) and is trademarked by the Church.\n\nThe Satanic Temple uses a personalized version of the Sigil of Baphomet as its official logo. In this version of the symbol the goat's head (redesigned), the inverted pentagram, the acronym of the organization (TST), and the circumcircle are depicted as black silhouettes.\n\n\n"}

The series was in four parts, with parts 2–4 having a tagline on their cover.\n\nThe story begins in a sewer-residing community at an undisclosed location (possibly on Earth). The characters are looking for someone when they find a seemingly decrepit woman in rags. At her request they attempt to help her stand, and she attacks them, beating the larger men easily before Annalee Call (Winona Ryder's character from \"\") identifies herself to the woman, who is revealed to be Ripley #8, the clone of Ellen Ripley (also from \"Alien: Resurrection\"). Call then takes Ripley back to her base of operations, where she expresses her sadness that Ripley left her after their promise to stay together after \"Alien: Resurrection\". She informs Ripley of a new military operation on the science station \"Typhoon\", involving a hybrid Alien super soldier, led by a Dr. Trollenberg. Also at this point, Ripley explains that she nearly didn't sign on for her position on the \"Nostromo\" (the start of the \"Alien\" story).\n\nThe story moves to Dr. Trollenberg working on the super soldier. He is approached by General Helm, who is in charge of the station and intent on shutting down the project after Trollenberg requested cybernetic components. The doctor opens fire and kills the general and his two guards, before changing his voice to match the general's and hailing the bridge, informing them that the general will remain with him in the lab until the completion of the project and can only be contacted there. He finishes by throwing the three bodies into a vat of acid.\n\nBack at Call's base, Ripley is still yet to be convinced to join the mission to stop Trollenberg's project. Ripley mentions that she no longer has nightmares about the aliens; she plainly states that they \"can't be stopped. The aliens are coming and the human race is going to suffer...they just do what they have to do. And then you're dead and it's over.\" Eventually Call blackmails Ripley, saying she will inform the military of her location, to which Ripley replies, \"I could learn to hate you.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a Predator is traveling toward the \"Typhoon\", intent on hunting the super soldier. Call, her crew and Ripley infiltrate the station disguised as \"the World's Most Unexceptional Food Delivery Service,\" and after killing the guards, move into Trollenberg's lab. Inside, they find Trollenberg, who proceeds to kill two of Call's crew (Echo and Saud) before the cloaked Predator decapitates him with its disc, leaving Call, Ripley, and the survivors stunned. Immediately, the now-decloaked Predator is thrown back into the room, only to be followed by the hulking form of the prototype super soldier who proceeds to fight the Predator.\n\nRipley, Call and her surviving crew (Blades and Voorman) stand stunned as the prototype supersoldier and Predator fight, noting that the super soldier is almost impervious to harm and is able to absorb metal objects to regenerate damage. After tearing off one of the Predator's arms, the super soldier moves to absorb a portion of the exterior bulkhead of the lab, opening a hole into the vacuum which quickly dispatches the Predator.\n\nMoving quickly back towards their shuttle (Carthage), with Trollenberg's head, the heroes quickly escape before the space station explodes from the breach, while the super soldier boards a smaller science vessel/escape pod, taking with it some alien chestbursters. As the space station explodes, Ripley has a bad feeling that the super soldier survived and, in the 'science pod', the super soldier commences work on a second super soldier who was also near completion.\n\nCall suggests she hack into Trollenberg's skull to learn more about him, explaining that the skull and its wiring \"is very weird... advanced in some ways, in others a real antique\". Once inside Trollenberg's memory, she encounters a shell program and is approached by an interactive recording of John Connor, who goes on to explain the Skynet war, concluding with the \"Skynet Resurrection Program\" which used a model known as the Crypto Terminators (of which Trollenberg was one) which were capable of existing in civilization indefinitely until such time that technological advancements would allow for a new generation of Terminators which would be unstoppable (during this, scenes from Trollenberg's existence are shown, including the creation of the super soldier). The recording finishes with \"the victorious forces of the 21st Century salute you... and wish you good luck\".\n\nLogging out of Trollenberg's memories, Call expresses concern that this is simply another great cover-up in history, but the discussion is cut short by three Predator spacecraft surrounding their ship. A trio of Predators teleport on board; Voorman attacks one of the Predators but is easily knocked away, while another grabs Ripley and lightly cuts her arm with its wrist blades, watching as her acidic blood burns the floor. The three Predators teleport off the ship with Ripley and their craft disappears. Elsewhere, the science pod reaches its destination (revealed in Part 3 as the Navy heavy cruiser \"Euphrates\") and the prototype disembarks, now accompanied by a new super soldier.\n\nOn the \"Carthage\", Voorman is being treated by Blades for the head injury he received from the Predator attack. Call surmises the Predators knew of Ripley's genetic heritage just as they did and that they most likely want her to assist in the threat posed by the super soldiers; she even wonders if they too encountered John Connor's sleeper virus, and ultimately decides they must use all this new information to their advantage.\n\nMeanwhile, on one of the Predators' spacecraft, Ripley stands on a teleportation pad watching the Predators remove their helmets, who then leave her to go about their business. Ripley comments \"Just when I think my life can't get any stranger... Just when I think I've fallen as far as I can fall... The bottom drops out and I wind up amazed and horrified all over again.\" She considers herself to now be beyond terror or outrage, even towards the Predators or their current disinterest in her. She walks through the craft, observing the work of the Predator armourers, and notes that the Predators are exuding an aura of menace throughout the 'heavy, nitrogen-rich air' of their craft, directed not at her, who she considers they currently deem worthless, but at something else, something connected to her DNA.\n\nRipley finds herself in a trophy room filled with dozens of Alien corpses and body parts, and understands that the Predators' lives revolve around the Aliens and that they know that both the super soldier and she are part Alien, which leads her to wonder if they are merely adding her to their trophy collection. A Predator moves up behind her, reaching for her, causing her to recoil in anger, punching the Predator to little effect before he throws her over his shoulder and carries her away. She is taken to a circular operating table and tied down whilst a breathing apparatus is attached to her face, followed by a thin needle drill moving towards her. She resists throughout, comparing them to the military who created her, commenting \"I guess I haven't fallen past terror after all...\".\n\nOn the \"Euphrates\", the ship's commanding officer complains about the 'android survivors' of the \"Typhoon\" and the super soldiers' request to be transferred to a high security asteroid facility. The CO has been uneasy since they arrived and has them restricted to the science pod. He approaches the pod and explains the delay, much to the original super soldier's displeasure, who demands access to the bridge, which the CO denies them. Shortly after a message arrives from Command, refusing the super soldiers access to the 'Black Asteroid'; this results in both super soldiers re-entering the science pod, launching and ramming the pod further into the \"Euphrates\". The super soldiers then disembark with firearms, quickly killing the crew present before the prototype super soldier begins to absorb parts of the cruiser's interior, resulting in critical damage to the ship's primary systems, including life support.\n\nOn the \"Carthage\", Call has determined that the Predators would be following the most likely course of the super soldier towards the nearest large source of Aliens' genetic material: Los Alamos 235, the large hill also known as mons veneris or the 'Black Asteroid'. Back on the Predators' spacecraft, Ripley experiences a dream where she is swimming in Aliens and encounters a ghostly image of a traditional Terminator endoskeleton before awaking. Regaining consciousness, Ripley notices a scar on the left rear side of her neck and is led from the operating table, past an assembled room of Predators in a Cleft of Venus formation, to a viewing screen of Los Alamos 235, sensing that there are Aliens within and that the Predators extracted this information from her DNA, from the Alien 'genetic memory'.\n\nNearby, the \"Euphrates\" is granted access to the Black Asteroid and opens fire on the station's control room. In the Predators' craft, Ripley has returned to the room of assembled Predators and undergoes a pre-battle ritual where she is given an Alien tooth necklace and is covered in Predator blood warpaint. Throughout the process, Ripley considers that there are monsters in this world, but the Predators are not them - they simply do what they must to survive and maintain balance in the universe when it comes to the Aliens, and that they see the arrival of the Terminator hybrids as an imbalance to the ecology of the stars, and that is the true evil. She understands that at any other time she would instead be merely a \"scalp on their belts\", but the current situation has made them allies and she knows \"they didn't much care for my human side... But, oh, do they respect and approve of the Alien in me!\".\n\nRipley knows she will soon \"do battle with the great abomination from Earth's wretched past\", as the super soldiers take control of the ship and make their way to a room filled with fully-grown Aliens in containment tubes. Ripley looks forward to destroying the man-made \"agents of true human evil\", and in regards to the Aliens on board, she will \"ride the whirlwind to glorious annihilation. Until then, I am learning to love the Alien\".\n\nThe next day, hidden amongst the smaller asteroids around Los Alamos 235, the \"Carthage\" and her crew watch the space surrounding the Black Asteroid, where an entire fleet of military ships have arrived to retake the station only to be wiped out by a powerful energy surge launched from the asteroid's entry point, draining the station of all external power and lowering its defences. The \"Carthage\" moves towards the station, entering unnoticed through the entry point as Call wonders whether the Predators have already made it here and if Ripley is still alive.\n\nInside, Ripley lies alongside a Predator on the ground in a field of orange smoke as a monstrous super soldier crouches over them, bearing the appearance of a dark blue, muscular, bald humanoid with red eyes, fangs, clawed hands and biomechanical 'veins' at its neck and wrists. Ripley considers that the day hadn't turned out like she'd hoped as she underwent the ritual the day before, remembering how they entered the asteroid, slipping unnoticed past its defenses and the fleet outside.\n\nThey had observed that, in less than 24 hours, the two super soldiers had created an entire sophisticated manufacturing plant which quickly grew more of the new blue skinned hybrids, and Ripley and the Predators attacked without hesitation. Quickly, as on the \"Typhoon\", the Predators were killed at every turn and even when a dying Predator activated its self-destruct device a super soldier sacrificed itself, wrapping its larger body around the Predator to absorb almost the entirety of the blast.\n\nRipley crawled away from the scene of the battle, finding herself amongst a stockpile of fully-grown Aliens, and saw a chance to even the odds and do what she was born to do, deactivating the stasis effect of the tubes, \"to release the Hounds of Hell!\". The Aliens quickly set upon the super soldiers and the Aliens' true power was revealed when a Predator killed one with his shoulder cannon, showering nearby super soldiers with acidic blood, critically wounding the hybrids. The remaining Predators used this to their advantage, unleashing blasts which spilt fatal bursts of acidic blood, killing both super soldiers and Aliens together with each shot although, ultimately, they were themselves overwhelmed by the Aliens once the last of the new super soldiers had died.\n\nRipley watches the carnage, frozen in place as the remaining Predators and super soldiers die, but the appearance of the prototype super soldier refocuses her and she follows through the station after him, knowing that if he escapes all their sacrifices will be for nothing. Rounding a corner, Ripley strikes out at the shadows of Call and Voorman, believing them to be the prototype, to the shock of all three of them. Ripley doesn't care for how they got there and insists that they go back the way they came and leave the station, telling them they will not survive if they go on any further and that there is nothing they can do. In the end, Ripley thanks Call: \"You did the right thing, bringing me back out into the black, I know that now. Please -- go. Let me do what I can do... Let me finish the job\".\n\nVoorman agrees with Ripley and drags Call back to the \"Carthage\", commenting that Call is \"a lot closer to human than she is\" as they leave. As Ripley returns to follow the original super soldier, the station begins to shake as the internal structure starts to collapse. Reaching the \"Carthage\", Call frees herself of Voorman's grip and starts to run back into the station after Ripley, but Voorman quickly captures her and takes her aboard the \"Carthage\", tying her to one of the seats to stop her from going after Ripley again. Throughout the process, Call resists Voorman's actions, commenting that she brought Ripley out here and forced all of this on her. Meanwhile, Ripley slips on board the ship and the hybrid prototype also boards.\n\nThe \"Carthage\" quickly exits the station, followed by the super soldier's ship, just as the station explodes. Ripley stalks towards the prototype, moving through the ship's internal piping. Ripley considers the similarities to what happened a time long ago on the \"Nostromo\"'s escape pod, the \"Narcissus\", where she was at the controls and the enemy stalked her instead. She realises that even now, with the roles reversed, she is just as terrified as she was then as she leaps forward to kill the prototype with a Predator knife, only to be knocked aside due to its superior speed and reflex response. Deciding to go with 'Plan B', Ripley cuts her left arm with the blade, waving it to spread her acidic blood as the super soldier holds her above him, his hands around her neck and right shoulder respectively. Ripley's blood begins to burn through the viewing panel of the airlock door, causing flames from the explosion that surrounded the ship to flood in, resulting in its destruction.\n\nOn board the \"Carthage\", Call has been released from the seat and is at one of the monitors when Blades comments on an explosion that occurred, separate from the one of the station. Call comments that it was Ripley finishing the job: \"She cleaned up the mess that we stumbled into. What the Connor virus told me -- about Skynet returning? She closed the book on that. I know she did. I forced her back out there. I got her into this. I'm going to have to live with that. I hope she made her peace. I think she got her dignity back. And her soul, maybe. Yeah. And her soul. And maybe she saved mankind's soul in the bargain. Let's go home.\"\n\nThe work has been collected as a trade paperback:\n\n\nOther related comic series include:\n\n\n"}

Basic cable testers are continuity testers that verify the existence of a conductive path between ends of the cable, and verify the correct wiring of connectors on the cable. More advanced cable testers can measure the signal transmission properties of the cable such as its resistance, signal attenuation, noise and interference. \n\nGenerally a basic cable tester is a battery operated portable instrument with a source of electric current, one or more voltage indicators, and possibly a switching or scanning arrangement to check each of several conductors sequentially. A cable tester may also have a microcontroller and a display to automate the testing process and show the testing results, especially for multiple-conductor cables. A cable tester may be connected to both ends of the cable at once, or the indication and current source portions may be separated to allow injection of a test current at one end of a cable and detection of the results at the distant end. Both portions of such a tester will have connectors compatible with the application, for example, modular connectors for Ethernet local area network cables. \n\nA cable tester is used to verify that all of the intended connections exist and that there are no unintended connections in the cable being tested. When an intended connection is missing it is said to be \"open\". When an unintended connection exists it is said to be a \"short\" (a short circuit). If a connection \"goes to the wrong place\" it is said to be \"miswired\" (the connection has two faults: it is open to the correct contact and shorted to an incorrect contact). \n\nGenerally, the testing is done in two phases. The first phase, called the \"opens test\" makes sure each of the intended connections is good. The second phase, called the \"shorts test\" makes sure there are no unintended connections.\n\nThere are two common ways to test a connection:\n\n\nThere are two common ways to test for a short:\n\nMore powerful cable testers can measure the properties of the cable relevant to signal transmission. These include the DC resistance of the cable, the loss of signal strength (attenuation) of a signal at one or more frequencies, and a measure of the isolation between multiple pairs of a multi-pair cable or crosstalk. While these instruments are several times the cost and complexity of basic continuity testers, these measurements may be required to certifythat a cable installation meets the technical standards required for its use, for example, in local area network cabling. \n\nAn optical cable tester contains a visible light source and a connector compatible with the optical cable installation. A visible light source is used, so that detection can be done by eye. More advanced optical cable testers can verify the signal loss properties of an optical cable and connectors. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1964606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964606", "title": "Alberto Vilar", "text": "Alberto Vilar\n\nAlberto Vilar, a.k.a. Albert Vilar, (born October 4, 1940) is an American former investment manager who became particularly known as a patron of opera companies, performing arts organizations, and educational institutions. Following the collapse of his investment firm, Amerindo Investment Advisors, he was tried and convicted in November 2008 on charges of money laundering, investment advisor fraud, securities fraud, mail and wire fraud. He was sentenced in February 2010 to nine years in prison and released in 2018.\n\nOriginally from West Orange, New Jersey, Vilar earned an economics degree from Washington & Jefferson College, a liberal arts college in Washington, Pennsylvania. He then earned a master's degree in economics at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York. In 1979, along with Gary Tanaka, he founded Amerindo Investment Advisors, an investment advisory firm based in San Francisco and New York, with offices in London. In 1981, Vilar made his first $1 million. Amerindo's main investment activities were in technology funds, which the stock market crash of 2000 severely affected. The value of the Amerindo funds declined sharply, and Vilar began to default on his pledges to arts institutions.\n\nVilar has served on the Washington & Jefferson College Board of Trustees.\n\nThe arts organisations to which Vilar pledged donations included:\n\nAs a result of his philanthropy, in 2002 the Americans for the Arts organization gave him their National Arts Award, for \"Corporate Citizenship in the Arts\".\n\nAs noted in James Stewart's 2006 \"New Yorker\" profile of Vilar, at some point in 2002, Vilar was hospitalized for a series of operations on his back, and he claims to have nearly died as the result of complications: \"they were ready to give me the last rites\". There was speculation that he might have missed some planned donations as the result of his illness.\n\nA lasting effect, however, clearly came from the severe decline in his personal fortune due to the crash in technology stocks around 2000. It is documented that Vilar still continued to make pledges even as his personal and his company's fortunes continued to plunge. Among the pledges were $5 million for money for voice loss research after meeting Julie Andrews and $30 million to a Berlin opera company: \"Asking Alberto for money was like offering an alcoholic a drink\". However, many of his pledges were never paid.\n\nVilar and Tanaka were arrested on May 26, 2005, on charges of securities fraud. The government claimed that the two appropriated as much as $5 million of an Amerindo client Lily Cates' (heiress and mother of actress Phoebe Cates) money for personal use. It was alleged that Vilar used the money to pay for some home repairs and to make good on previously-promised charitable contributions. It was also alleged that Tanaka used money to purchase thoroughbred race horses. The SEC also filed a civil suit.\n\nAccording to Stewart's article in \"The New Yorker\", an extensive analysis of Vilar's rise and fall, \"Vilar maintains that when he was arrested he was on the brink of a financial comeback. Everything I predicted about the Internet has come true... I'm ready to go back to work and make money.\" Stewart continues: \"if convicted, Vilar and Tanaka face fines of more than ten million dollars and prison terms of up to a hundred and fifty-five years. But Vilar says, 'We'll sort this out. I'll get beyond this. I will always try to help others... I still love opera and classical music... The Met is not going to get my money, but it will not kill my love of music.'\"\n\nThe charges did not allege wrongdoing at Amerindo's mutual funds, and when the firm was wound up there were no missing funds. But Morningstar, a fund analysis company, advised investors to withdraw their money in any case, because the funds had been performing very poorly. In fact, as with many other funds investing in internet companies, investors had already been pulling out for some time, reducing assets and causing expense ratios to increase. Extensive seizures of records and computers in the course of the investigation compelled Amerindo's board to merge the fund with Munder Capital Management's fund, \"Munder NetNet\", later renamed \"Munder Internet\". The seizures were ruled excessive by a federal judge in early 2007.\n\nVilar and Tanaka's trial began in September 2008, with Herald Price Fahringer as Vilar's defence attorney and Glenn Colton representing Tanaka. The trial concluded on November 19, 2008 with the conviction of Vilar on all 12 counts with which he had been charged and the conviction of Tanaka on 3 counts.\n\nOn February 5, 2010, Vilar was sentenced to nine years in prison, while Tanaka was sentenced to five years. They were both featured in the fifth season of the television series \"American Greed\". In October 2012, after having served more than 2 1/2 years at the Fort Dix, New Jersey, Federal Correctional Institution, the appeals court, over the objections of the prosecution, ordered his immediate release pending the appeal. Vilar and Tanaka were returned to jail in November 2013. In April 2014, Vilar was returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional year for preventing the victims' families from recovering their lost funds.\n\nIn a 2000 interview with Philipp Blom, Vilar had estimated his donations to opera houses and other performing arts centers in some 150 million dollars granted over the previous 10 years\n\nMany of the organizations to which Vilar had pledged donations gradually began to remove his name from parts of their institutions where it had been prominently placed.\n\nIn July 2005 the Royal Opera House announced that, following Vilar's failure to maintain the agreed payment schedule, his name would be removed from the building. Later his name was removed from the young artists program when a new donor stepped forward.\n\nAt the Metropolitan Opera, where his name appeared on the \"Vilar Grand Tier\", it has since been removed. The Washington Opera's young artists program has also been renamed (after additional support was found) as the \"Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program\", and the Kennedy Center's \"Arts Management Fellowship\" program has similarly dropped the Vilar name.\n\n\n"}

On 2 July 1943, she participated in the bombardment of the Vila Stanmore and Shortland Island areas in Kula Gulf, coming under the fire of enemy shore batteries.\n\nFrom 21 to 25 November, she pounded East Island in Empress Augusta Bay with 200 rounds of 5 inch ammunition. Sorum and Makatawa on northeast Bougainville next felt her blows, and she then proceeded north of Buka Island for an offensive sweep between Buka and Green Islands. On the morning of 20 January, she retired southward with her task unit to give fire support to the landings on Bougainville Island itself.\n\nDuring landings in the New Britain-New Ireland area, \"Renshaw\" dealt considerable damage to enemy airfield installations while coming under the fire of shore batteries. On 13 March the ship was in the Empress Augusta Bay area where she bombarded enemy positions in the jungles east of the beachhead held by Allied forces.\n\nAfter a short period of amphibious training at Pearl Harbor, \"Renshaw\" led a force of LSTs to the Marianas Islands. At first assigned to the outer destroyer screen, she later closed the Tinian beach to provide star shell illumination and fire support for troops ashore who were undergoing a heavy counterattack.\n\nIn November 1944, while operating with a destroyer division bombarding enemy installations in the Ormoc Bay area and conducting anti-shipping sweeps in the waters westward of Leyte, \"Renshaw\" spotted on the surface. \"Renshaw\" and accompanying destroyers , , and immediately commenced fire and, after a brief one-sided duel during which the submarine returned fire with small caliber weapons, the enemy vessel was destroyed.\n\nAfter a turnaround in San Pedro Bay, \"Renshaw\" and other units of her task group made a high-speed run to Ormoc Bay in an effort to intercept enemy transports reported unloading there. However, only a single Japanese vessel, a large wooden barge, was found, which \"Renshaw\" took under fire and destroyed while she came under air attack.\n\nOn 31 December 1944, \"Renshaw\" sortied with a task unit en route to screen a large transport formation assigned to land troops in the Lingayen Gulf area on 9 January 1945. Despite repeated air attacks during the voyage through the Sulu and South China Seas, the powerful invasion armada reached its objective without serious damage.\n\nWhile in the Mindanao Sea, on 21 February 1945, \"Renshaw\" was struck by a torpedo from an enemy submarine, about 10 feet (3 m) below the waterline, flooding the firerooms. The ship lost all power, a large section of the hull was warped by the explosion, and bulkheads and decks were fractured. Even though 19 men were killed and 20 injured, within a matter of minutes, damage control parties had the flooding reduced by half. Through their efforts the main propulsion machinery suffered no damage. She managed to get under way again, and was escorted to San Pedro Bay by .\n\nTemporary repairs were made in April by the ship's crew and men from the destroyer tender and the repair ship . \"Renshaw\" then proceeded under her own power from the forward area to the Todd Pacific Shipyard in Tacoma, Washington, where permanent repairs were completed early in October 1945.\n\nOn Navy Day, 27 October 1945, in New York Harbor, President Harry S. Truman reviewed the greatest victory parade in naval history from \"Renshaw\".\n\n\"Renshaw\" decommissioned in February 1947 and was attached to the U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet. During 1949 and 1950, she was converted to a specialized antisubmarine vessel and recommissioned in June 1950 as DDE-499.\n\nDuring the Korean War, \"Renshaw\" had two tours of duty in the Far East, May to November 1951 and November 1952 to June 1953, in which she served as an escort, patrol, search and rescue, and bombardment vessel. Subsequently, \"Renshaw\" served in the Pacific Proving Grounds, February to May 1954, during Operation Castle, rendering patrol and air control services for Joint Task Force 7.\n\nThis was followed by a short tour in the Far East from June to August 1954 where \"Renshaw\" rescued a British airman from the sea while acting as plane guard for the Royal Navy carrier , and also participated in a hunter-killer exercise with a force composed of United States and Canadian ships. On 8 August 1955, \"Renshaw\" sailed for her fourth tour in the Far East, spending most of her time in hunter-killer exercises and task force operations. She subsequently made additional Far Eastern deployments from Pearl Harbor, October 1956 to May 1957, December 1957 to May 1958, February 1959 to July 1959, and April 1960 to October 1960.\n\nIn 1960, \"Renshaw\" received Weapon Alpha, a new anti-submarine weapon, and on 17 December 1961, recovered the nosecone of \"Discoverer 36\". She made a further WestPac deployment in 1962. On 7 August 1962 she was redesignated a destroyer and resumed the hull number, DD-499. On 3 October, \"Renshaw\" participated in the recovery of Project Mercury astronaut Commander Walter M. Schirra. Spending most of 1963 operating out of Pearl Harbor, \"Renshaw\" deployed to WestPac again in November 1963, returning 6 months later.\n\nIn 1964 \"Renshaw\" took part in the movie \"In Harm's Way\".\n\nOn 3 March 1965, \"Renshaw\", in company with other units of Destroyer Division 252, departed Pearl Harbor on short notice to augment destroyer forces for the rapidly expanding naval commitments in the South China Sea. During April and May, she served in surveillance roles and in support of carrier striking force operations. In June she was on Taiwan patrol, returning to Vietnamese waters in July, where she remained until September before steaming via Japan for Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn October and December \"Renshaw\" served as an alternate recovery ship in Project Gemini. Her 11th WestPac tour began 5 July 1966. She participated in anti-submarine operations, as an aircraft carrier rescue destroyer, in special operations with in the Tonkin Gulf, and in special operations and patrol duties in the Taiwan Strait. DesDiv 252 returned to Pearl Harbor 16 December 1966.\n\n\"Renshaw\" remained in the Hawaiian area throughout 1967. She departed Pearl Harbor 8 April 1968 for WestPac where she provided escort services for the fast carrier attack forces on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf. In September \"Renshaw\" returned to Pearl Harbor. In June 1969 she sailed for WestPac and Yankee Station where she rescued one pilot from the water. In December 1969, she returned from the Far East to Pearl Harbor. \"Renshaw\" decommissioned on 14 February 1970 and was struck from the Navy List the same day. She was sold for scrapping in October 1970 to Zidell Explorations, Inc..\n\n\"Renshaw\" earned eight battle stars for World War II service; five battle stars for Korean War service; and six battle stars for Vietnam War service. Her Ship's Bell survives, and is at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum.\n\nSee USS \"Renshaw\" for other ships of the same name.\n\n"}

{"id": "1964622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964622", "title": "Cameron Jerome", "text": "Cameron Jerome\n\nCameron Zishan Rana-Jerome (born 14 August 1986), known as Cameron Jerome, is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Turkish Süper Lig club Göztepe. He earned 10 caps for the England under-21 team.\n\nJerome began his career as a trainee with Huddersfield Town, Grimsby Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough before signing a professional contract with Cardiff City in the summer of 2004. He quickly became a regular at Ninian Park and after scoring 20 goals in 2005–06 he was signed by Birmingham City for a fee of £3 million. He spent five years at St Andrew's where he experienced two promotions and two relegations and also helped the side win the 2011 Football League Cup. He joined Stoke City in August 2011 for a fee of around £4 million and was mainly used as an impact player by Tony Pulis. After not figuring in new manager Mark Hughes' plans Jerome joined Crystal Palace on loan for the 2013–14 season. Jerome joined Norwich City in August 2014, and after 138 appearances in three-and-a-half years, he signed for Derby County in January 2018.\n\nJerome was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and is of Grenadian descent. As a youth, Jerome played for Stile Common, alongside Anthony Griffith, Fraizer Campbell, and Reuben Noble-Lazarus; who all went on to enjoy careers as professional players. Griffith and Jerome also played for Yorkshire Counties. Jerome later joined home town club Westend Juniors before moving on to Huddersfield Town as a junior, then moved on via Grimsby Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough to gain a contract at Cardiff City, after being recommended by reserve team manager Paul Wilkinson. Jerome played under Wilkinson in Grimsby's youth system, but after Wilkinson left Blundell Park to take up his position with Cardiff in October 2003, Jerome was released by replacement Neil Woods for being a disruptive influence.\n\nDescribed by the BBC as \"one of Cardiff's rising stars\", Jerome made his debut in a 0–0 draw with Leeds United on 2 October 2004, as a substitute for Andy Campbell, before going on to score seven goals in 32 appearances in the 2004–05 season, and was in a good run of form in the 2005–06 season, finishing top scorer for Cardiff with 20 goals.\n\nHis hot form earned him a contract with second-city club Birmingham City. The move not only benefitted Jerome but also helped Cardiff as they used the transfer money to sign Michael Chopra, Stephen McPhail and Glenn Loovens. Jerome appeared in an April 2005 \"FourFourTwo\" article which heralded the Yorkshire forward as the eighth best player in the Football League.\n\nJerome signed for Birmingham City on 31 May 2006, for a transfer fee reported as an initial £3 million, potentially rising to £4m. Jerome made his debut as a 66th-minute substitute against Colchester United at St Andrew's on 5 August. However, it was a debut to forget, as he was sent off within five minutes of entering play elbowing an opponent in the face. He netted his first goal for Birmingham against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on 12 September. Jerome had a slow first season at St Andrew's by his own admission, scoring just 9 times in 44 games in all competitions.\n\nJerome scored his first Premier League goal after 32 seconds of the away match against Derby County on 25 August 2007; his second goal of that game confirmed Birmingham's first win of the 2007–08 season. He finished the season as Birmingham's second top goal scorer with 7 goals in 33 games as Birmingham were relegated. However, the Blues immediately bounced back in the 2008–09 season by finishing second in the Championship. Jerome's 10 goals in 45 appearances were only bettered by veteran partner Kevin Phillips in the Birmingham attack. He scored the first goal in the West Midlands derby match against Wolverhampton Wanderers as Birmingham won 2–0.\n\nIn July 2009, Jerome signed a new five-year contract with the club. He scored a spectacular first goal of the 2009–10 season to give his club a 2–1 lead against Liverpool, described as \"the kind of goal that only the likes of Gerrard usually scores at Anfield\"; he held off Javier Mascherano before \"unleashing a 30-yard thunderbolt that flew beyond the reach of Reina and dipped under the crossbar\". Jerome hit a purple patch as the Blues notched up a club-record fifteen consecutive games unbeaten in the Premier League, scoring crucial goals against Stoke City, Manchester United and two versus Blackburn Rovers. His tenth goal of the season, a header from James McFadden's cross, came in a 5–1 defeat away to Manchester City. Two weeks after the final game of the season, Jerome's goals total rose to 11 when he was awarded an extra goal by the Dubious Goals Committee for his attempt against Burnley, which had originally been given as an own goal by Brian Jensen.\n\nJerome was a 92nd-minute substitute as Birmingham won the 2011 League Cup, defeating favourites Arsenal 2–1 at Wembley Stadium.\n\nOn 31 August 2011, the last day of the transfer window, Jerome signed a four-year contract with Premier League club Stoke City for an undisclosed fee, believed by \"Sky Sports\" to be £4 million. He scored on his Stoke City debut in the UEFA Europa League against Dynamo Kiev to earn his side a 1–1 draw away from home. He scored against Maccabi Tel Aviv in a 3–0 win but was then sent off for two bookable offences. Jerome scored his first League goal for Stoke against Wigan Athletic on 31 December 2011; it was his first league goal for more than 13 months. He was used in a squad rotation system by manager Tony Pulis, something which he admitted he would have to accept. He continued to make an impact as a substitute, scoring against West Bromwich Albion and Everton. However, he began to vent his frustration at his lack of starts.\n\nThe 2012–13 season began with Jerome again on the bench and almost joining Blackburn Rovers on loan. In a rare appearance, against Newcastle United on 28 November 2012 coming on as a substitute, he provided an assist for Jonathan Walters and then scored the winning goal. On 29 December, Jerome \"lashed into the top corner from 30 yards\" to score Stoke's third goal in a 3–3 draw with Southampton in the final minute of the match. He scored his third and final goal of the season in a 2–1 win against Reading on 9 February 2013. Stoke ended the season in 13th position with Jerome making 30 appearances of which nine were starts. At the end of the season Tony Pulis was replaced by Mark Hughes and Jerome criticised Pulis' lack of squad rotation. – \"There's no guarantees [for places under Hughes] but before in the old regime, there was a guaranteed XI who played. No matter what happened, how you trained or if you came on and did well in the games you were involved in, you were still never going to start.\"\n\nOn 5 August 2013 Jerome admitted an FA charge of breaching betting regulations. He was fined £50,000 and was also severely warned as to his future conduct by the FA.\n\nOn 2 September 2013 Jerome joined Crystal Palace on loan for the 2013–14 season. He made his debut for the club on 14 September, coming on as a 64th-minute substitute for Dwight Gayle in a 2–0 defeat away at Manchester United. After a poor start to the season Ian Holloway left Palace by mutual consent and Tony Pulis was appointed manager on 23 November. Despite Jerome criticising Pulis towards the end of his time at Stoke, he started and scored against his former club Cardiff City on 7 December. In total Jerome played 29 times for the Eagles scoring twice as they finished in 11th position.\n\nOn 20 August 2014 Jerome joined Championship club Norwich City for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £1.5 million. He scored his first goal for the club on 13 September in a 4–2 away victory over Cardiff City. His goal was the fourth of Norwich's second-half goals, in a game which they came from 2–0 behind to win. Jerome scored twice in a 3–0 win three days later away at Brentford. He scored another two on 20 September against former club Birmingham City, taking his tally to five goals in four league matches. He scored his sixth goal on 4 October in a draw with Rotherham United that kept Norwich top of the table. He added another two on 31 October as Norwich beat Bolton 2–1.\n\nAfter an impressive first season at Norwich, Jerome was voted third in the club's annual Player of the Season competition. Norwich finished third, just short of automatic promotion, and qualified for the playoffs. They reached the final against Middlesbrough, and Jerome scored the opening goal in a 2–0 victory for the Canaries. Jerome had an effective game, frustrating Middlesbrough with his frequent pressing, and was named man of the match.\n\nOn 6 August 2016, Jerome scored in the 4–1 win away to Blackburn Rovers on the opening day of the 2016–17 season. On 21 August, he scored Norwich's only goal in the East Anglian derby, which ended in a 1–1 draw at Portman Road. Jerome scored his 16th and last goal of the season in the 7–1 thrashing of Reading on 8 April 2017.\n\nOn 16 January 2018, Jerome joined Derby County on a one-and-a-half-year contract. The fee, officially undisclosed, was reported by Sky Sports as £1.5 million. He scored his first goal for Derby in a 3–0 home win against Brentford on 3 February, and finished the season with 6 from 20 appearances, including a goal in the play-off semi-final, as Derby failed to gain promotion.\n\nOn 31 August 2018, Jerome joined Turkish Süper Lig club Göztepe for an undisclosed fee. His first goal for the club opened the scoring in a 3–2 home win against Konyaspor on 30 September.\n\nJerome made 10 appearances for the England under-21 team between 2005 and 2008 without scoring.\n\nJerome's younger brother, Sam, played football for Leeds United's youth teams until May 2009. Jerome grew up supporting Manchester United.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nNorwich City\n"}

Graduates earn either the International Baccalaureate (\"IB\") or the French Baccalaureate (\"French Bac\"). The IB curriculum is taught in English, while the French Bac is taught in French. A common misconception is that French is required to attend IHS. This is not true. Non-French speakers follow the IB curriculum. Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the students graduate with the IB diploma. (The IB is an internationally recognized degree program, with the fastest growth coming in the United States. Stuart Hall/Convent in San Francisco and Berkeley High School are two schools in the Bay Area that also offer the IB diploma.)\n\nIB and French Bac graduates earn substantial college credit from pursuing these programs. Many graduates attend respected universities. At IHS, for example, 61 out of 239 graduates (37%) in the last three graduating classes (2015-17) matriculated at University of Chicago (10), UC Berkeley (9), NYU (8), Carnegie Mellon (7), Stanford (6), UCLA (6), King's College London (5), St. Andrews (4), Harvard (3), Columbia (3), Cornell (3), Washington University (3), Johns Hopkins (3), Georgetown (3), MIT (2), Brown (2), Williams (2), Penn (2), University College London (2), Carleton (2), Davidson, Emory, London School of Economics, and Wellesley. \n\nThe IHS faculty is recruited from all over the world and represents over 20 nationalities. The average number of years of teaching experience is just under 20, and more than 80% of the faculty hold master's degrees or higher.\n\nInternational High School's campus consists of a main building at 150 Oak St., a gymnasium and outdoor recreational space across the street, and an Arts Pavilion on 66 Page St. The school has acquired the lots at 98 Franklin and 84 Page and is currently in the process of selecting designs for the development of an expanded urban campus. The main building at Oak Street houses classrooms and science labs, teacher workrooms, administrative offices, the library, the design lab, as well as the rooftop deck. The Arts Pavilion houses the music, film, visual arts, and theater programs. The lower floors of the main building house Chinese American International School and French American International School, both K-8 schools. \n\nEach entering class at International is composed of 90-100 students. In the past few years, there have been around 250 applications for the approximately 50 open spots in the entering freshman class. (The remaining 40-50 students that made up the entering class came from the affiliated French-American K-8 school.) Incoming students arrive at IHS from the following middle schools in the Bay Area, among others: \n\na) Independent schools: Presidio Hill, SF Day, Hamlin, Live Oak, Town, Burke, Friends, Adda Clevenger, Children's Day, Marin Country Day, Head Royce (Oakland), Redwood Day (Oakland), Bentley (Oakland)\n\nb) Parochial/Religious schools: Cathedral, Stuart Hall, Convent, Brandeis, Zion Lutheran, St. Thomas More, Notre Dame des Victoires, St. Paul Episcopal, Holy Spirit\n\nc) Bilingual schools: Chinese American International School, Ecole Bilingue de Berkeley, Lycée Français de San Francisco, International School of the Peninsula\n\nd) Public schools: Alice Fong Yu, Aptos, Everett, Gateway, Hoover, Kipp Bridge, Lawton, Presidio, Rooftop, Mill Valley Middle, Crocker Middle (Hillsborough) Ingrid Lacy (Pacifica), Fernando Rivera (Daly City)\n\nA small number of students enter from schools abroad. Over 30% of the families receive financial aid.\n\nThe school offers extensive language offerings in French, Chinese, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic. Students are able to take native level classes in French and Chinese (and Spanish if there is sufficient demand) beginning in their freshman year. During the IB years in 11th and 12th grade, the school offers both Level A (native/bilingual level) and Level B (non-native) courses in French and Chinese. (The school offers Level A in Spanish when there is sufficient demand.) Spanish, Italian and Arabic are offered at Level B (non-native) level in the IB years. All students take a minimum of four years of a language other than English; many take a third language as well. All of the language teachers are native in the tongue that they teach. \n\nInternational High School's students make yearly cultural, service oriented, and linguistic trips to multiple destinations across the world. The extensive travel program at IHS is unique in the Bay Area. In 2017-18, groups of 10-20 students from grades 9 to 11 will travel to Vietnam, China and Tibet, Denmark and Germany, the American South, England, Ecuador, Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, Senegal, Thailand, and India and Myanmar for approximately two weeks. The school also offers longer 6 to 8 week exchanges intended to enhance the students’ globally focused education outside the classroom and enrich their linguistic proficiency. The trips often consist of exchange programs in which IHS students are hosted by local families in the foreign country. In 2015-16, IHS students had the opportunity to undertake exchanges in France (Paris, Bordeaux, Tahiti), Spain, Bolivia, and Peru. In return, IHS families host students from the various foreign countries in their homes in San Francisco.\n\nService learning is an integral part of the curriculum at International as it is a core component of the IB diploma program. Students perform at least 100 hours of service activities throughout their years at IHS. The service component culminates with a month long Creativity Action Service project fully organized by each student. Examples of CAS projects in the past have been: an annual student-run TEDx program, a student organized community development project in Nicaragua, a fundraising evening of music and food for the Chigoli organization in Malawi, a student-organized and run summer volleyball class for girls at John Muir Elementary, a student founded and led LGBT club (\"LASER\") to raise consciousness about LGBT issues, among many others. The school partners with an extensive list of non-profit organizations that the students regularly become engaged with, including Amigos de las Americas, Breakthrough San Francisco, Family House, Habitat for Humanity, John Muir Elementary After School Beacon Program, My Yute Soccer, Reading Partners, Rocket Dog Rescue, and Teens Teaching Elders Technology, among others. The student body is also active in annual blood drives for Blood Centers of the Pacific, day-long volunteer efforts at the S.F. Food Bank, and others. \n\nIHS is also known for its international community service projects, most prominently raising money to build schools in Jemjem Legabatu, Ethiopia, and M'bour, Senegal. Each year, students at International organize an evening of musical performances by students and faculty known as Songs for Senegal to raise funds to support École Natangué in Senegal. IHS has had a key role in the construction and growth of École Natangué. \n\nInternational sponsors twenty athletic teams that compete with other high schools throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. As of 2017-18, the school competes in the BCL Central league in team sports. Scott Kennedy joined the school as Athletic Director in 2015-16, after 16 years at Mission High School. Scott is the recipient of several leadership and coaching awards, including the California State Athletic Directors Association \"Athletic Director of the Year\" Award and the Positive Coaching Alliance \"National Double-Goal Coach\" Award. The athletic program at IHS consists of eleven different sports at the Varsity and Junior Varsity levels (including two clubs sports - sailing and skiing) and around 55 percent of the student body participates in athletics throughout the academic year. The sports are as follows:\n\nFall: co-ed cross country (varsity and JV), men's soccer (varsity and JV), women's tennis (varsity and JV), women's volleyball (varsity and JV), sailing (varsity and JV)\n\nWinter: men's basketball (varsity and JV), women's basketball (varsity and JV)\n\nSpring: co-ed badminton (varsity), co-ed swimming (varsity), co-ed track (varsity), men's baseball (varsity), men's tennis (varsity and JV), women's soccer (varsity) \n\nNotable results: In Fall 2017, the men's soccer team went the North Coast Section (NCS) playoff tournament and earned a quarter-finals slot. In 2016-17, IHS attained the following additional results in BCL league play: first in men's and women's basketball; first in baseball; and second in badminton; third in women's volleyball; third in men's tennis. The women's varsity soccer team reached the finals of the NCS playoff tournament. The women's basketball team made it to the CIF State tournament in 2016-17.\n\nStudents at International have the option of taking art - whether it be music, theater, visual arts, or film - in each of their four years. In 9th grade, students explore two art forms, one each semester. In 10th grade, each student chooses one art form for a deeper exploration lasting the entire year. In 11th grade, students can choose to continue with a two-year art course as part of the IB Diploma. This IB art course is a rigorous exploration at the same level of depth and commitment as any of the other five IB courses taken by each student. (The five other IB courses fall in the following categories: English Literature, Mathematics, Science, Humanities/Social Science, and a Second Language other than English.) Thus, many students take art for four years at International. (If a student does not choose the art course, the \"sixth course\" as it is known can be in any of the other academic disciplines, e.g., a second Science course or a second Humanities course.) \n\nInternational opened the Dennis Gallagher Arts Pavilion in September 2009. The Pavilion includes a black-box theater, a state-of-the-art film and video editing classroom, as well as music and visual arts studios. Student engage in a broad range of artistic activities and classes there: from writing and directing one act plays to making short films, from painting murals to composing music. The arts are not limited to classes during the regular school day. The Visual Arts department puts on exhibitions throughout the year, with the work of the IB visual arts students prominently on display at the March Arts Reception and at the end-of-year May Arts Festival. The after school performing arts program includes theater and music. \n\nThe school's after school theater program is known as Back à Dos and it is the heart of the performing arts at IHS. The program enjoys the largest participation of any school sponsored extra-curricular activity other than athletics. Every year, Back à Dos produces at least three major shows, including a set of student-directed one act plays (many of which are original student-written pieces), a musical with live musical accompaniment by IHS musicians, and a play. Past performances include Spamalot, Cabaret, and Spring Awakening.\n\nThe after school music program holds auditions at the beginning of the year for the ensemble that performs during the Spring Musical. Rehearsals take place twice a week after school from January until the end of the musical, usually in mid to late March. Student-musicians also participate in the IHS orchestra, which rehearses twice a week after school in the fall culminating in a recital at the Florence Gould Theater in the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. There are several major music concerts during the year - Songs of Senegal (in the Fall and used as a fundraiser for an IHS backed school in Senegal, consists mostly of small group pop/rock, jazz, and vocal performances), the Florence Gould Recital (for chamber, jazz, and acoustic performances in January), and two Rock/Pop/Jazz Concerts (in January and May). \n\nThe school offers Design Technology courses beginning in the freshman year (required for all entering students) and continuing in 10th and in the IB years (11th and 12th) as an optional elective. The freshman course includes a coding component taught by a computer science teacher. The IB Design Technology course incorporates elements of physics, engineering, and art and design. The school partners with SF's Tech Shop in offering its IB design courses and participates in the Maker Faire in San Mateo.\n\nInternational High School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the French Ministry of Education,the International Baccalaureate Organization, and the National Association of Independent Schools, and Council of International Schools.\n\n\n"}

It is now part of BAE Systems Electronics & Integrated Solutions, a subsidiary of BAE Systems. It concentrated on developing and manufacturing electronic systems, notably aircraft self-protection systems, and tactical surveillance and intelligence systems. Other business areas included microwave, missile and space electronics; infrared imaging; and automated mission planning systems, with both military and commercial applications.\n\nThe first home video game console was developed as a side project by engineer Ralph H. Baer and several assistants at Sanders. The production of the final product was granted to Magnavox, a home electronics company, and sold under the name Magnavox Odyssey.\n\nThe company was founded in Waltham, Massachusetts in July 1951, formed by eleven engineers and scientists from Raytheon. It was named for Royden C. Sanders, Jr., one of the original eleven associates. It moved its operations to Nashua in 1952, taking up a vacant mill building and restoring economic vitality to a city that had been devastated by the post-World War II departure of the textile industry from New England to the lower-cost American South.\n\nSanders Associates was one of the premier flexible printed circuit manufacturers during the 1960s and 1970s. It specialized in complex flexible circuit assemblies and specialized printed wiring boards for both the U.S. military and space programs including the Saturn V and Lunar Excursion Module. Sanders also produced flexible circuity for most other commercial applications including medical equipment. Sanders Flexprint division was involved with producing printed wiring boards and flex circuitry for all branches of the military and for all platforms. The Flexprint division was sold in the late seventies or early eighties.\n\nMost divisions of Sanders Associates competed in the government marketplace. One division marketed intelligent terminals to the commercial marketplace. These intelligent terminals competed against IBM 3270 terminals, Honeywell terminals, Univac Uniscope terminals and Burroughs Corporation terminals. Terminals provided data entry capability into mainframes as well as light pen pointing and selection before the mouse was in use. The last Sanders Intelligent terminal system marketed was the 814 terminal controller that supported up to eight terminals. That division was acquired by Harris Corporation in the late 1970s and integrated with their Data Communications Division. For a short time, the Nashua plant facilities were shared between Sanders and Harris, eventually the Harris division was moved to a new facility in Dallas, Texas.\n\nIn 1986, Sanders Associates was bought by Lockheed Corporation and became Sanders, A Lockheed Company. Following the Lockheed/Martin Marietta merger in 1995, Sanders was merged into Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems. In July 2000, Lockheed announced the sale of this group to BAE Systems for $1.67 billion. The company became BAE Systems Information & Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS). In 2005, this was merged into the newly created BAE Systems Electronics & Integrated Solutions.\n\nThe first home video game console was developed at Sanders by a team headed by Ralph Baer in 1966. It became the Magnavox Odyssey. \n\n"}

Jesus has just been baptized by John the Baptist and in this verse the Holy Spirit comes to him like a dove.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:16.\n\nGundry notes the emphasis the author of Matthew gives to how quickly Jesus gets out of water of the Jordan. An emphasis not found in Mark or Luke. Gundry believes this is because the baptism would traditionally have been followed by a confessing of sins and the author of Matthew wanted to be clear that Jesus, who had no sins, did not undergo this part of the ritual.\n\nFrance notes that the \"heavens were opened\" echoes . France feels that this might thus represent the return of the gift of prophecy to the earth. Hill notes that some early manuscripts have \"opened up to him\" rather than just \"opened up.\" This makes the event a more private one, and helps explain why the crowds depicted as watching the baptism in Luke do not become aware of Jesus' status.\n\nThe dove imagery in this passage, and in the corresponding verse in Luke, is a well known one. Based on this verse the dove has long been a symbol for the Holy Spirit in Christian art. France notes that the wording in Matthew is vague, the Spirit could be descending in the shape of a dove or it could be descending in the manner of the dove. Luke is explicit that it is in the shape of a dove, and most readers accept this meaning.\n\nThis is the only event where the Spirit is described as taking such a form. There was a wide array of symbolism attached to the dove at the time the gospel was written. Albright and Mann note that in and the dove is a symbol for the nation of Israel. Clarke feels that this verse links to both Genesis 1:2, with the image of God hovering over the water, and to where Noah sends a dove out over the water to search for land. Clarke feels the symbolism of the dove was thus one of creation with Jesus' baptism symbolically the rebirth of the world. In the Greco-Roman world the dove was at the time seen as a symbol of lust, as it was the symbol of Aphrodite. It was also, however, a symbol of purity due to its whiteness and the belief that it was without bile.\n\nThe spirit \"coming on him\" may be a reference to a series of prophecies in Isaiah (, , ) where the spirit is described as being placed on God's chosen one. France notes that this doesn't mean the Holy Spirit has been absent from Jesus beforehand, as Matthew 1 makes clear it has been present since his conception.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this verse are:\n"}

His highest rank was \"ōzeki\", which he held for fifty tournaments. As an active \"rikishi\" he was extremely popular and was nicknamed the \"Prince of Sumo\" due to his good looks and relatively slim build. He was the father of Wakanohana Masaru and Takanohana Kōji, and as head of the Futagoyama stable coached both of them to the \"yokozuna\" rank.\n\nHe had been a champion swimmer while at school, but did not think he could make a living out of it. He was determined to join professional sumo, in spite of some opposition from his family, who had wanted him to continue swimming (he was considered a possibility to make the team for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City).\n\nHe began his career in the spring of 1965, joining Futagoyama stable which had been set up his elder brother, former \"yokozuna\" Wakanohana Kanji I, three years previously. He initially fought under his own surname of Hanada. He reached the top \"makuuchi\" division in November 1968 at the age of just 18, the youngest ever at the time (the record is now held by his son Takanohana). He weighed barely 100 kg, and would remain one of the lightest men in the top division for the rest of his career. He adopted the \"shikona\" of Takanohana in 1969. He was the last man to beat \"yokozuna\" Taihō, in May 1971. As he rose up the rankings he collected nine special prizes, including four prestigious \"Ginō-shō\", or Technique Awards.\n\nAfter finishing as runner-up in consecutive tournaments in May and July 1972 he reached sumo's second highest rank of \"ōzeki\" in November 1972. He was promoted at the same time as his friend and rival Wajima, who quickly went on to be promoted to \"yokozuna\". Takanohana's progress was slower, but he did win two top division tournament (or \"honbasho\") championships in March and September 1975, each time delighting the crowds by defeating the giant \"yokozuna\" Kitanoumi in a playoff. He and Wakanohana were the first brothers ever to each win a top division tournament title. He was also runner-up in the January and March 1977 tournaments. However he was ultimately unable to defeat Kitanoumi or Wajima on a regular basis, and was hampered by his inability to put on weight, and so never made the \"yokozuna\" rank. Nevertheless, he was an \" ōzeki\" for fifty tournaments, corresponding to over eight years in the rank. This was a record until July 2007 when it was broken by Chiyotaikai. He was a bigger crowd attraction than some \"yokozuna\".\n\nBy the early 1980s he was finding it harder to hold onto his rank, and had been overtaken by his stablemate Wakanohana Kanji II, and other younger wrestlers. One of his final bouts was a memorable clash in September 1980 with Hawaiian born Takamiyama, who was nearly twice his weight and like Takanohana, extremely popular with the Japanese public. Takanohana looked to have won the match with an underarm throw, only for the judges to reverse the referee's decision and rule that the tip of Takanohana's topknot or \"oichomage\" had brushed the surface of the \"dohyo\" ahead of his opponent.\n\nAfter losing to the rising star Chiyonofuji twice in a row in September and November 1980, he decided the time was right to retire. The two were often compared, and Takanohana had been something of a mentor to Chiyonofuji, advising him to give up smoking to help increase his weight, something that Takanohana himself had never been able to manage.\n\nAfter retiring from sumo in January 1981, he took the name Fujishima and established the Fujishima stable in 1982, which grew to be one of the most powerful in terms of top \"makuuchi\" ranked wrestlers. When his elder brother retired as a stablemaster in 1993 he purchased the Futagoyama \"toshiyori-kabu\" or elder stock, with the help of 300 million yen from his \"koenkai,\" or network of supporters. The two stables merged, and the newly renamed Futagoyama stable had one quarter of all the top ranked \"rikishi\" in it at one point, including two \"yokozuna\", an \"ōzeki\" and many others regularly in the junior \"san'yaku\" ranks. During this time it was undoubtedly the most powerful stable the sumo world has seen in the postwar period. He oversaw the promotion of both of his sons to \"yokozuna\", the first time ever that two siblings have held sumo's highest rank.\n\nHe was married in 1970 to a former actress and beauty queen, Fujita Noriko, who was once \"Miss Ōita Prefecture\". They were divorced in 2001.\n\nHis health began to decline in 2003, and he withdrew from his duties in the Sumo Association. He passed on control of Futagoyama stable to his son Takanohana in January 2004, and made his last public appearance in January 2005 at the retirement ceremony of one of his former wrestlers, Takanonami.\n\nIn February 2005, his son publicly announced that his father was struggling with mouth cancer (he had been a heavy smoker of Mild Seven cigarettes for most of his life). He underwent extensive treatment, but no recovery was possible, and on 30 May 2005, he succumbed to the disease at the age of 55. There was an acrimonious battle between Takanohana's sons over who should be head mourner at his funeral. More than 1200 attended the event, which was held in Aoyama, Minato, Tokyo. The Sumo Association also held a public funeral in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on June 13. This was the first time in nine years that a former wrestler had been afforded this honour.\n\nTakanohana's favoured techniques were \"hidari-yotsu\" (a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on his opponent's \"mawashi\"), \"tsuridashi\" (lift out) and \"uwatenage\" (overarm throw). He was also noted for his ability to spin at the edge of the ring and turn the tables on his opponent with the \"utchari\" throw.\n\n \n\n\n"}

He also played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Milwaukee Brewers, Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants. Hill is one of only five players in MLB history to hit for the cycle twice in one season.\n\nAt age 15, Hill and friends were participating in a soccer tournament in Park City, Utah. While on their way to a round of golf, a college student narrowly missed Hill's car and slammed into his mother's car following behind him. Hill's mother, Vicki, was killed as a result.\n\nHill was originally drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the 7th round of the June 2000 Draft.

In 2001, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named playoff MVP of Wareham's league championship team.\n\nHill was Toronto's first draft pick (13th overall) in the 2003 MLB draft, and he made his major league debut on May 20, 2005, after being called up from the minor leagues a day earlier as an injury replacement for Corey Koskie. Although he was brought up as a shortstop, Hill appeared as a third baseman, a designated hitter, and as a second baseman during the course of the season. He finished the 2005 season with a .274 batting average, .348 OBP, and 25 doubles in 361 at-bats. After the trade of Orlando Hudson to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Hill became the starting second baseman for the Blue Jays in 2006, but was moved back to shortstop mid-season after the demotion of Russ Adams. After experiencing defensive struggles at shortstop, he was then moved back to second base, with John McDonald taking over at shortstop.\n\nOn May 29, 2007, in a game at home against the New York Yankees with Andy Pettitte pitching, Hill became only the second player in Blue Jays history to accomplish a \"straight steal\" of home.\n\nHill won a Fielding Bible Award at second base for his fielding excellence in 2007.\n\nOn April 4, 2008, Hill agreed to a four-year, $12 million deal that included a club option that could have run through the 2014 season. The contract would have been worth as much as $38 million if Toronto kept Hill in the fold for all seven years of the deal.\n\nOn May 29, Hill suffered a Grade II concussion in a collision with teammate David Eckstein during a game against the Oakland Athletics. Hill missed the remainder of the season.\n\nHill returned from his concussion during spring training. On July 5, 2009, Hill was selected by managers and players to take part in the 2009 MLB All-Star Game in St. Louis. Hill finished the 2009 season with 37 doubles, 36 home runs, 108 runs batted in, and a batting average of .286. After the season, Hill received the 2009 AL Comeback Player of the Year. He was voted the Blue Jays Player of the Year. He was also honored with his second Fielding Bible Award.\n\nPrior to the first game of the 2011 season, the Blue Jays announced that they had declined the three option years on Hill's contract. Hill was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 24, retroactive to April 20, with a strained hamstring.\n\nOn August 23, 2011, Hill and John McDonald were traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for second baseman Kelly Johnson.

On May 7, 2016, Hill had a career day at the plate hitting three home runs and driving in seven runs. His home runs included a game-tying home run in the eighth inning and a go-ahead grand slam in the tenth inning. Hill had only hit three home runs in his previous 82 games at the time.\n\nOn July 7, 2016, the Brewers traded Hill to the Boston Red Sox for Aaron Wilkerson and Wendell Rijo.\n\nOn February 17, 2017, Hill signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants.

It is a form of hypotaxis, where English would use parataxis, the conjunction of two verbs, \"come and take\". This construction normally (but not always) occurs within narrative literature.\n\nThe first word, ' (\"having come\") is the aorist active participle (masculine, nominative, singular) of the Greek verb ' \"to come\". \nThe aorist stem is μολ- (the present stem in βλώ- being a regular contraction of μλώ-, from a verbal root reconstructed as \"*melə-\", \"*mlō-\" \"to appear\").\nThe aorist participle is used in cases where an action has been completed, also called the perfective aspect.\nThis is a nuance indicating that the first action (the coming) must precede the second (the taking). \n\nThe second word, , is the second person singular imperative of \"take; grasp, seize\".\nThe entire phrase is thus in the singular, i.e. Leonidas is depicted as addressing Xerxes personally, not the Persian army as a group.\n\nPlutarch cites the phrase in his \"Apophthegmata Laconica\" (\"Sayings of Spartans\").\nThe exchange between Leonidas and Xerxes occurs in writing, on the eve of the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC):\nThe exchange is cited in a collection of sayings by Leonidas before the Battle of Thermopylae (51.2–15).\n\nThe main source for the events of the battle is Herodotus. According to his account, the Spartans held Thermopylae for three days, and although ultimately defeated, they inflicted serious damage on the Persian army. \nMost importantly, this delayed the Persians' progress to Athens, providing sufficient time for the city's evacuation to the island of Salamis. Though a tactical defeat, Thermopylae served as a strategic and moral victory, inspiring the Greek forces to defeat the Persians at the Battle of Salamis later the same year and the Battle of Plataea one year later.\n\nModern use of as a military motto appears to originate in the Kingdom of Greece during World War I or the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). \nThe motto is on the emblem of the I Army Corps of Greece and the Second Infantry Division of Cyprus.\nThe phrase was inscribed on the Thermopylae monument (1955), using an archaic script that would be appropriate for the time of the Persian Wars.\n\nDuring the Cyprus Emergency, fought between Greek Cypriot insurgents and British troops, \nCypriot leader Grigoris Afxentiou on 3 March 1957 was surrounded by British forces outside his secret hideout near the Machairas Monastery near Lazanias, Nicosia. \nThe British asked Afxentiou to surrender his arms but he replied with \"molon labe\". Unable to drive him out and after sustaining casualties, the British forces resorted to pouring petrol into his hideout and lighting it, burning him alive.\n\nAllusion to the phrase in translation (\"come and take it!\") is recorded in the context of the American revolution,\nnoted in 1778 at Fort Morris in the Province of Georgia, and later in 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales during the Texas Revolution where it became a prevalent slogan.\nUse of the original Greek in the United States is more recent. Its use by militia organizations is reported for the 1990s or early 2000s, and use by the Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) is recorded for 2006. \n\nIn early January 1831, prior to the Texas Revolution, Green DeWitt wrote to Ramón Músquiz, the top political official of Bexar, and requested armament for defense of the colony of Gonzales. This request was granted by delivery of a small used cannon. The small bronze cannon was received by the colony and signed for on March 10, 1831, by James Tumlinson, Jr. The swivel cannon was mounted to a blockhouse in Gonzales and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the Battle of Gonzales—the first battle of the Texas Revolution against Mexico—a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders from Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase \"come and take it\" along with a black star and an image of the cannon that they had received four years earlier from Mexican officials. This was the same message that was sent to the Mexican government when they told the Texans to return the cannon; lack of compliance with the initial demands led to the failed attempt by the Mexican military to forcefully take back the cannon.\n\nReplicas of the original flag can be seen in the Texas State Capitol, the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum, the Sam Houston State University CJ Center, the University of Texas at El Paso Library, the Marine Military Academy headquarters building, the Hockaday School Hoblitzelle Auditorium, and in Perkins Library at Duke University.\n\nIn the United States, the original Greek phrase and its English translation are often heard as a defense of the right to keep and bear arms and opposition to gun control legislation.\nIt began to appear on websites in the late 1990s and early 2000s. \nIn 2012, SIG Sauer introduced a 1911 pistol model named \"Spartan\" with the motto ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ inscribed in the same style as used on the 1955 Thermopylae monument, inscribed on the grip plates and engraved on the slide. A successor model \"Spartan II\" was introduced in 2019.\n\n"}

The word was coined in botanical usage in the 1590s, from Latin \"umbella\" \"parasol, sunshade\". The arrangement can vary from being flat-topped to almost spherical. Umbels can be simple or compound. The secondary umbels of compound umbels are known as umbellules or umbellets. A small umbel is called an umbellule. The arrangement of the inflorescence in umbels is referred to as umbellate, or occasionally subumbellate (almost umbellate).\n\nUmbels are a characteristic of plants such as carrot, parsley, dill, and fennel in the family Apiaceae; ivy, \"Aralia\" and \"Fatsia\" in the family Araliaceae; onion (\"Allium\") in the family Alliaceae.\n\nAn umbel is a type of indeterminate inflorescence.\nA compressed cyme, which is a determinate inflorescence, is called umbelliform if it resembles an umbel.\n\n"}

They often have poor work ethic and are apt to be regularly fired from or reprimanded at work; in the cases where a disorganized offender has a steady work ethic, they work blue collar jobs or jobs which require little or no use of reasoning or intelligence. They are socially inadequate and possess little or no interpersonal skills; most disorganized offenders have never been married or in a serious relationship. Although a disorganized offender may claim to be heterosexual, evidence will usually suggest that they are either a virgin or that their sexual conquests have come in relation to a paraphilia, such as necrophilia, bestiality, or pedophilia. Some disorganized offenders have exhibited homosexual tendencies, but in such cases, any homosexual contact they may have had will usually be either as a symbolic act of dominance or as an offshoot of one of their paraphilias. They most often live alone or with a family member.\n\nDisorganized offenders have an innate fear or anxiety in regard to people, especially strangers, and usually live in a complex delusion that they have constructed in their own mind. Ed Gein, for example, exhumed the corpses of women who he believed reminded him of his mother and consumed parts of them because he believed that he could preserve his mother's soul inside of his own body, going so far as to create a \"female suit\" made of human flesh that he would wear when assuming his mother's identity.\n\nDisorganized offenders, lacking confidence and the skills necessary to plan a crime, do not venture far from their homes when committing murders.

{"id": "1964699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964699", "title": "Radiotelevizija Slovenija", "text": "Radiotelevizija Slovenija\n\nRadiotelevizija Slovenija () – usually abbreviated to RTV Slovenija (or simply RTV within Slovenia) – is Slovenia's national public broadcasting organization. Based in the country's capital, Ljubljana, it has regional broadcasting centres in Koper and Maribor and correspondents around Slovenia, Europe and the world. RTV Slovenija's national radio services operate under the name , while the television division carries the name or . The names are sometimes Anglicized as \"Radio Slovenia\" and \"TV Slovenia\", respectively. There are three national and four regional radio services, which can all be heard online as well. RTV Slovenija also finances the RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra and the RTV Slovenia Big Band.\n\nThe legal foundation for the institution is the Radiotelevizija Slovenija Act (). It is the only public nonprofit broadcasting organization in Slovenia to operate both radio and television stations. The law also requires it to air radio and television services for the country's two indigenous linguistic minorities, which it does in collaboration with the regional broadcasting centres in Maribor (for the Hungarian-speaking minority) and in Koper (for the Italian-speaking minority). Approximately 73% of RTV Slovenija's funding comes from television licence fees.\n\nRadio Ljubljana signed on the air for the first time on September 1, 1928, with experimental broadcasts. By October 28 the radio station already had a scheduled programme. On April 11, 1941, the station's transmitter in Domžale was destroyed and the station was occupied by Italy.\nOn April 1, 1949, the first TV laboratory was established in Ljubljana, but was separate from the radio station. However, the task of setting up a television service was eventually assigned to Radio Ljubljana. Second radio program started in 1951. On November 11, 1958 the TV channel got a regular schedule, but it was shared by other Yugoslav republics, with TV Ljubljana getting around 30% of airtime. TV Ljubljana produced its first broadcast for Eurovision, showing ski jumping in Planica, in 1960. The color program broadcasting started in 1966. During that decade, the amount of programming produced exclusively for Slovenian audiences increased substantially. On April 15, 1968, the main evening newscast was broadcast in the Slovenian language for the first time. It had previously originated in Belgrade and was produced in Serbo-Croatian.\n\nIn 1970, the RTV Slovenia record label was established. In 1971, TV Koper/Capodistria, a subsidiary of RTV Ljubljana, was launched as the first bilingual TV station in Slovenia, serving the Italian community in Slovenia and Croatia. However, it enjoyed huge popularity in many parts of Italy. There, RAI still had a monopoly on television, so many Italians eagerly tuned into the new Yugoslav station, which broadcast mostly in color. Private companies built transmitters and translators in various parts of Italy that made TV Koper-Capodistria (generally known as \"Telecapodistria\" in Italy) available to millions of Italians. Because the station used the PAL color standard, Italians bought PAL TV sets in large numbers, ending the hopes of the French government that Italy might adopt its SECAM system instead. With the advent of privately owned, purely commercial television in Italy, the station's popularity eventually began to diminish.\n\nDuring the 1970s, TV Ljubljana's main service was also gradually converted to color. In 1984, teletext was introduced, whereas the digitalization started in 1986. In 1989, Radio Ljubljana started transmitting an RDS signal.\n\nAt first, TV Ljubljana's second television network primarily relayed programs from other Yugoslav television stations. In the late 1980s, however, the percentage of TV Ljubljana's own programs on the second network increased dramatically.\n\nA year before Slovenia's independence in 1991, the institution was renamed to \"Radiotelevizija Slovenija\" (from RTV Ljubljana). On January 1, 1993, RTV Slovenija was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union following the collapse of Yugoslavia, and began participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, TV Slovenia began to face increased competition from Slovenia's commercial television stations. In 1995, RTV Slovenija published its first web page. Radio digitalization started in 1995, whereas the digitalization of television broadcasting started in 1999.\n\nIn 1997, satellite broadcasting started via Hot Bird 3. In 2001, RTV Slovenija's Multimedia Centre was established to help introduce new technologies. A new multimedia web portal was introduced in 2002. This portal includes regular news updates, broadcast archives, and the live transmission on line of most services, both radio and television. RSS feeds were introduced in 2005. The public broadcaster referendum, 2005 was approved by a slight majority of voters, but the referendum saw a very low turnout. On November 12, 2005 a law was passed stating that Radio-television Slovenia is \"a public institution of special cultural and national importance...\"\n\nIn May 2008 TV Slovenia began airing a new TV channel, TV Slovenija 3, dedicated primarily to live Parliament coverage. In August 2008 TV Slovenia broadcast their first HD event – Olympic Games 2008 on test DVB-T channel. The Slovenian public broadcaster law referendum, 2010 was rejected by voters. In 2011, analogue signal was abandoned.\n\nThe 1994 Law on RTV Slovenia regulates public broadcasting. RTV Slovenia has a Programming Council and a Supervisory Board; RTV is required by law to be independent and autonomous, to respect human integrity and dignity in its programs, to observe the principle of impartiality, and to ensure the truthfulness of information and the pluralism of opinions and religious beliefs. The law also requires the public broadcaster to provide radio and TV programs for the Italian and Hungarian minorities in Slovenia.\n\nAfter EU accession, the new 2005 Law on RTV Slovenia reintroduced a dominant role of the state and the executive in the appointment of RTV's governing bodies, excluding civil society institutions (e.g. universities, association of writers, and sports organisations) which were previously involved. The draft law raised several domestic and international criticisms, including from the International Federation of Journalists and the Council of Europe, but the Slovenian institutions dismissed most of them and went along with adopting the new law in November 2005, which was later narrowly confirmed by 50.7% of voters in a special referendum.\n\nThe current governance system of RTV Slovenia allows control over almost all managerial bodies and over the appointment of all key editors to the governmental majority. Majority parties also control the majority of the new Programming Council and Supervisory Board of RTVS, thus being also able to appoint RTVS' Director General, who will in turn appoint and manage the directors of radio and TV, the editors-in-chief, and the senior management. This governance system is deemed a threat to the independence and credibility, trust, and respect with the public of RTV Slovenia by the European Journalism Centre. The following period indeed saw a host of cases of political interference in the editorial and journalistic work of the Slovenian public broadcaster, whose public credibility (particularly for the TV) fell dramatically.\n\nThe \"Varuh pravic poslušalcev in gledalcev\" (“Listener and Viewer Ombudsman”) of RTV Slovenia was appointed for the first time in 2008, according to art.16 of the RTV Slovenia Law, to \"address the comments and suggestions of viewers and listeners\" and \"give instructions to the director-general regarding changes that must be effected on channels.” \n\nRTV Slovenija's national radio networks are based in Ljubljana and broadcast in Slovene. They can be heard throughout Slovenia.\n\nRTV Slovenija's regional radio stations are based in regional RTV centres, and broadcast in Slovenian and/or the languages of the indigenous minorities in the area. They can be heard only in their own regions.\n\nThe stations are:\n\nOther radio services:\n\nRTV Slovenija operates three national and two regional television services. All except Tele M can be watched online.\n\nRTV Slovenija's national television networks can be watched all over Slovenia and are based in Ljubljana. They are broadcast in Slovenian.\n\nEach of the regional RTV centres has its own television facilities. While TV Koper/Capodistria is bilingual (Italian and Slovenian), the Hungarian public has no regional station, but has regular broadcasts on TV Slovenija 1.\n\nThe regional stations are:\n\nRTV SLO's official logo is \"Boy with a Flute\" and name in two versions: a longer \"RADIOTELEVIZIJA SLOVENIJA\" or a shorter \"RTV SLO\".\n\nClocks on TV Slovenija were introduced in 1959.\n\nThe previous clock was used from January 8, 2007 until April 23, 2012. The clock was white on a blue background, next to the clock is an advert. (Was changed slightly in 2009, where the name \"TELEVIZIJA SLOVENIJA\" was moved from beside the clock to the clock's face and changing tip seconds from white to red.)\n\nThe current clock is used from April 23, 2012. The clock is white, on the bottom of the clock is the RTVSLO logo, an advert is next to the clock.\n\nThe test card TV Slovenija is PM5544, introduced in the 1970s. Nowadays test cards are rarely broadcast.\n\n\n\n\n\nDnevnik Televizije Slovenija is daily news show.\n\n\n"}

He grew up in Tijuana, Mexico, where he trained in the arts of kenpo, boxing and wrestling due to frequent street fights.\n\nMitre graduated from Montgomery High School in San Diego, California in June 1999. He and his wife, Tonya, have a son named Sam (Sergio Armando Mitre III), who was born on December 29, 2006. They also have a young daughter named Senya.\n\nMitre was the Chicago Cubs 7th-round selection in the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft out of San Diego City College. He was the second player out of the 2001 draft to make it to the majors with the Cubs, the first being Mark Prior. Mitre made his major league debut for the Cubs in after being called up from the West Tenn Diamond Jaxx (at the time, West Tenn was the Cubs' Double-A affiliate). He played in 3 games in 2003 (2 starts) and had an 0-1 record with an 8.31 ERA.\n\nIn , Mitre started out the season on the Opening Day roster, filling in for the injured Mark Prior. He was sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs after Prior came back from injury. On August 13, 2004, Mitre pitched a complete game shutout against the Albuquerque Isotopes. Mitre gave up only a double and a walk, both coming in the first inning of the game. After this, Mitre sat down 23 straight batters, striking out 9 batters in the game. He became the Pacific Coast League‘s Player of the Week. He finished the Iowa Cubs 2004 season (after going back and forth to Chicago) with a 6-4 record, and a 2.97 ERA.\n\nMitre returned to the majors after the September roster expansions and pitched 4 games out of the bullpen. His season ending total was a 2-4 record with a 6.62 ERA in 12 games (9 starts).\n\nIn , Mitre started off on Triple-A Iowa's roster, and on May 10, , he was recalled from Iowa, only to be sent down after two games and not pitching in either.

On June 14, 2005, Mitre pitched his first complete game, along with his first shutout in a 14-0 victory over the Florida Marlins against Josh Beckett.\n\nOn December 7, 2005, Mitre and minor league pitchers Ricky Nolasco and Renyel Pinto were traded to the Florida Marlins for Juan Pierre. Mitre pitched 15 games for the Marlins in .\nIn the season, Mitre won a career-high five games. He also set career bests with 27 games played, 27 starts, 149.0 innings pitched and 80 strikeouts. Mitre had a streak of not allowing an earned run in 24.2 consecutive innings. This streak lasted five starts, beginning May 20 at Tampa and ending June 15 at Kansas City. He made Marlins history with his 1.12 ERA in May, the second lowest for a starting pitcher during May in Marlins history, a feat only topped by Chris Hammond, who turned in a 0.61 ERA in May . Mitre began to see injury problems beginning in 2007, missing two weeks with a blister on his right middle finger, and time later in the season for a strained right hamstring. He had three stints on the disabled list, foreshadowing his season.\n\nMitre did not play in a game in 2008. On July 15, Mitre underwent Tommy John ligament replacement surgery to fix right forearm tightness. As is the case with all Tommy John surgery patients, he was expected to miss 12 – 18 months. He was released by the Marlins at the end of the 2008 season.\n\nOn November 3, Mitre signed a one-year minor league contract with the New York Yankees with an option for 2010.\n\nMitre was suspended for the first 50 games of the 2009 season after testing positive for androstenedione in August 2008. Mitre said the androstenedione came from a contaminated legal supplement purchased from GNC, but took full responsibility for his actions. He served his suspension while still on the disabled list from last year's Tommy John surgery.\n\nMitre returned to action, pitching well in nine starts for the Single-A Tampa Yankees and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. Replacing an injured Chien-Ming Wang, Mitre was called up to the majors to start against the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday, July 21, 2009. Mitre pitched 5 innings, allowed 3 runs, and got the win. Mitre earned a World Series ring when the Yankees won their 27th World Series title, though he was not on the postseason roster.\n\nMitre recorded his first career save on August 19, 2010, pitching the last 3 innings of a Yankees 11-5 win over the Detroit Tigers.\n\nOn March 25, 2011, Mitre was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Chris Dickerson. He was designated for assignment on June 27, after posting a 3.27 ERA in 33 innings.\n\nMitre was traded back to the Yankees on June 29 for cash considerations. On June 19, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with inflammation in his right shoulder. In four games with the Yankees, he posted an 11.81 ERA and was not offered a contract for the 2012 season.\n\nAfter his MLB career, Mitre played baseball in Japan while continuing to rehab his shoulder. He was unable to make a comeback.\n\nEventually, Mitre returned to California. He currently coaches a competitive baseball organization that he founded called the Playmakers.\n\nOn April 29, 2017, Mitre signed with the Bravos de León of the Mexican Baseball League.

{"id": "1964701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964701", "title": "Photoperiodism", "text": "Photoperiodism\n\nPhotoperiodism is the physiological reaction of organisms to the length of night or a dark period. It occurs in plants and animals. Photoperiodism can also be defined as the developmental responses of plants to the relative lengths of light and dark periods. They are classified under three groups according to the photoperiods: short-day plants, long-day plants, and day-neutral plants.\n\nMany flowering plants (angiosperms) use a photoreceptor protein, such as phytochrome or cryptochrome, to sense seasonal changes in night length, or photoperiod, which they take as signals to flower. In a further subdivision, \"obligate\" photoperiodic plants absolutely require a long or short enough night before flowering, whereas \"facultative\" photoperiodic plants are more likely to flower under one condition.\n\nPhytochrome comes in two forms: P and P. Red light (which is present during the day) converts phytochrome to its active form (pfr). This then triggers the plant to grow. In turn, far-red light is present in the shade or in the dark and this converts phytochrome from pfr to pr. P is the inactive form of phytochrome and will not allow for plant growth. This system of P to P conversion allows the plant to sense when it is night and when it is day. P can also be converted back to P by a process known as dark reversion, where long periods of darkness trigger the conversion of P. This is important in regards to plant flowering. Experiments by Halliday et al. showed that manipulations of the red-to far-red ratio in Arabidopsis can alter flowering. They discovered that plants tend to flower later when exposed to more red light, proving that red light is inhibitory to flowering. Other experiments have proven this by exposing plants to extra red-light in the middle of the night. A short-day plant will not flower if light is turned on for a few minutes in the middle of the night and a long-day plant can flower if exposed to more red-light in the middle of the night.\n\nCryptochromes are another type of photoreceptor that is important in photoperiodism. Cryptochromes absorb blue light and UV-A. Cryptochromes entrain the circadian clock to light. It has been found that both cryptochrome and phytochrome abundance relies on light and the amount of cryptochrome can change depending on day-length. This shows how important both of the photoreceptors are in regards to determining day-length.\n\nIn 1920, W. W. Garner and H. A. Allard published their discoveries on photoperiodism and felt it was the length of daylight that was critical, but it was later discovered that the length of the night was the controlling factor. Photoperiodic flowering plants are classified as \"long-day plants\" or \"short-day plants\" even though night is the critical factor because of the initial misunderstanding about daylight being the controlling factor. Along with long-day plants and short-day plants, there are plants that fall into a \"dual-day length category\". These plants are either long-short-day plants (LSDP) or short-long-day plants (SLDP). LSDPs flower after a series of long days followed by short days whereas SLDPs flower after a series of short days followed by long days. Each plant has a different length critical photoperiod, or critical night length.\n\nModern biologists believe that it is the coincidence of the active forms of phytochrome or cryptochrome, created by light during the daytime, with the rhythms of the circadian clock that allows plants to measure the length of the night. Other than flowering, photoperiodism in plants includes the growth of stems or roots during certain seasons and the loss of leaves. Artificial lighting can be used to induce extra-long days.\n\nLong-day plants flower when the night length falls below their critical photoperiod. These plants typically flower during late spring or early summer as days are getting longer. In the northern hemisphere, the longest day of the year (summer solstice) is on or about 21 June. After that date, days grow shorter (i.e. nights grow longer) until 21 December (the winter solstice). This situation is reversed in the southern hemisphere (i.e., longest day is 21 December and shortest day is 21 June).\n\nSome long-day obligate plants are:\n\nSome long-day facultative plants are:\n\nShort-day plants flower when the night lengths exceed their critical photoperiod. They cannot flower under short nights or if a pulse of artificial light is shone on the plant for several minutes during the night; they require a continuous period of darkness before floral development can begin. Natural nighttime light, such as moonlight or lightning, is not of sufficient brightness or duration to interrupt flowering.\n\nIn general, short-day (i.e.long-night) plants flower as days grow shorter (and nights grow longer) after 21 June in the northern hemisphere, which is during summer or fall. The length of the dark period required to induce flowering differs among species and varieties of a species.\n\nPhotoperiodism affects flowering by inducing the shoot to produce floral buds instead of leaves and lateral buds.\n\nSome short-day facultative plants are:\n\n\nDay-neutral plants, such as cucumbers, roses, tomatoes, and Ruderalis (autoflowering cannabis) do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism. Instead, they may initiate flowering after attaining a certain overall developmental stage or age, or in response to alternative environmental stimuli, such as vernalisation (a period of low temperature).\n\nDaylength, and thus knowledge of the season of the year, is vital to many animals. A number of biological and behavioural changes are dependent on this knowledge. Together with temperature changes, photoperiod provokes changes in the color of fur and feathers, migration, entry into hibernation, sexual behaviour, and even the resizing of sexual organs.\n\nThe singing frequency of birds such as the canary depends on the photoperiod. In the spring, when the photoperiod increases (more daylight), the male canary's testes grow. As the testes grow, more androgens are secreted and song frequency increases. During autumn, when the photoperiod decreases (less daylight), the male canary's testes regress and androgen levels drop dramatically, resulting in decreased singing frequency. Not only is singing frequency dependent on the photoperiod but the song repertoire is also. The long photoperiod of spring results in a greater song repertoire. Autumn's shorter photoperiod results in a reduction in song repertoire. These behavioral photoperiod changes in male canaries are caused by changes in the song center of the brain. As the photoperiod increases, the high vocal center (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA) increase in size. When the photoperiod decreases, these areas of the brain regress.\n\nIn mammals, daylength is registered in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is informed by retinal light-sensitive ganglion cells, which are not involved in vision. The information travels through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Some mammals are highly seasonal, while humans' seasonality is largely believed to be evolutionary baggage.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964717", "title": "Jam session", "text": "Jam session\n\nA jam session is a relatively informal musical event, process, or activity where musicians, typically instrumentalists, play improvised solos and vamp on tunes, songs and chord progressions. To \"jam\" is to improvise music without extensive preparation or predefined arrangements, except for when the group is playing well-known jazz standards or covers of existing popular songs. Original jam sessions, also 'free flow sessions', are often used by musicians to develop new material (music) and find suitable arrangements. Both styles can be used simply as a social gathering and communal practice session. Jam sessions may be based upon existing songs or forms, may be loosely based on an agreed chord progression or chart suggested by one participant, or may be wholly improvisational. Jam sessions can range from very loose gatherings of amateurs to evenings where a jam session coordinator or host acts as a \"gatekeeper\" to ensure that only appropriate-level performers take the stage, to sophisticated improvised recording sessions by professionals which are intended to be broadcast live on radio or TV or edited and released to the public.\n\nOne source for the phrase \"jam session\" came about in the 1920s when white and black musicians would congregate after their regular paying gigs, to play the jazz they could not play in the \"Paul Whiteman\" style bands they played in. When Bing Crosby would attend these sessions, the musicians would say he was \"jammin' the beat\", since he would clap on the one and the three. Thus these sessions became known as \"jam sessions\". Mezz Mezzrow also gives this more detailed and self-referential description, based on his experience at the jazz speakeasy known as the Three Deuces:\n\nThe New York scene during World War II was famous for its after-hours jam sessions. One of the most famous was the regular after-hours jam at Minton's Playhouse in New York City that ran in the 1940s and early 1950s. The jam sessions at Minton's were a fertile meeting place and proving ground for both established soloists like Ben Webster and Lester Young, and the younger jazz musicians who would soon become leading exponents of the bebop movement, including Thelonious Monk (Minton's house pianist), saxophone player Charlie Parker, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. The Minton's jams had competitive \"cutting contests\", in which soloists would try to keep up with the house band and outdo each other in improvisational skill.\n\nInfluenced by jazz, Cuban music saw the emergence of improvised jam sessions during the filin movement of the 1940s, where boleros, sones and other song types were performed in an extended form called \"descarga\". During the 1950s these \"descargas\" became the basis of a new genre of improvised jams based on the son montuno with notable jazz influences pioneered by the likes of Julio Gutiérrez and Cachao. During the 1960s, descargas played an important role in the development of salsa, especially the salsa dura style.\n\nAs the instrumental proficiency of pop and rock musicians improved in the 1960s and early 1970s, onstage jamming—free improvisation—also became a regular feature of rock music; bands such as Pink Floyd, Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Deep Purple, The Who, the Grateful Dead, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Santana, King Crimson, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Allman Brothers Band would feature live improvised performances that could last 10 to 20 minutes or longer.\n\nIn this context, jams are not casual get-togethers, but rather improvised portions of rehearsed public concerts.\n\nThough the Grateful Dead are often credited as being the first jam band, Cream incorporated long improvisations into their songs as early as 1967. However, the Grateful Dead allowed the \"jam band\" to become a genre unto itself; more recent bands following in their steps include Phish, moe., Umphreys Mcgee, and Widespread Panic, all of which feature extended improvisational sessions. Other bands, such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers also regularly perform live jam sessions. Progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria often end shows with a jam session to their song \"The Final Cut\" with different instruments.\n\nBluegrass music also features a tradition of jamming. Bluegrass jams happen in the parking lots and campgrounds of bluegrass festivals, in music stores, bars and restaurants and on stages. Bluegrass jams tend to be segregated by the skill level of the players. Slow jams for beginners provide an entry point. Open bluegrass jams are open to all comers, but the players in an open jam will expect a certain level of proficiency from participants. The abilities to hear chord progressions and keep time are essential, and the ability to play improvised leads that contain at least a suggestion of the melody is desirable. Jams that require advanced musical proficiency are generally private events, by invitation only.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1964724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964724", "title": "Something Wicca This Way Comes", "text": "Something Wicca This Way Comes\n\n\"Something Wicca This Way Comes\" is the first episode of the television series \"Charmed\", which was broadcast on The WB on October 7, 1998. This is the second and only aired pilot for the series. The original pilot never made it to air and was shot in the actual manor that is shown on the show. After Lori Rom quit \"Charmed\", executive producer Aaron Spelling asked Alyssa Milano, whom he knew from \"Melrose Place\", to be her replacement and the show moved to a sound studio. \"Something Wicca This Way Comes\" was the highest rated episode of \"Charmed\" in the entire series. It was watched by 7.7 million viewers and broke the record for the highest-rated premiere episode in The WB's three-year history. The name of this episode is a play on words from Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\": \"By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\"\n\n\"Charmed\" focuses on the lives of three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), as they deal with their grandmother's death and learn that they inherited a little more than the house they grew up in. All three of them have inherited magic powers; Prue has the power of telekinesis, Piper has the power to freeze, and Phoebe has the power of premonition. Together they try to live everyday normal lives in San Francisco, while battling demons and warlocks, and keeping their supernatural identities a secret.\n\nPiper (Holly Marie Combs) arrives late at the Halliwell Manor, which infuriates Prue (Shannen Doherty) as they were trying to get an electrician. Prue states that Piper's boyfriend Jeremy (Eric Scott Woods) has sent some flowers and a bottle of Port, the ingredient she needs for her showpiece recipe in the morning. Piper sees an old spirit board that Prue found in the basement while she was looking for a circuit tester. She turns it over to see the inscription on the back. \n\nThe pair then begin to wonder about their sister Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) who is living in New York. Prue suggests that they should rent out the spare room at a reduced rate in exchange for fixing things around the house. Piper suggests that Phoebe could move in before admitting that two weeks earlier she had agreed to allow her sister to move back in. Prue is not happy with this since she and Phoebe had fallen out over Prue's husband-to-be, Roger (Matthew Ashford). Phoebe, who is broke, had been accused of sleeping with Roger causing Prue to break off the engagement.\n\nPhoebe and Piper are seen playing with the spirit board. As Piper goes into the kitchen, the pointer on the spirit board starts to spell a word. Phoebe freaks out and calls in Piper and then Prue to see what the pointer is doing but it doesn't move while all three are watching. She tries to convince both sisters that the pointer is moving and making out a word, but they do not believe her since Phoebe is known to have moved the pointer in the past. Piper then sees the pointer move briefly and then the spirit board finally spells out the word \"attic\" as Phoebe writes it down on paper. As the storm continues, the power goes out. Piper and Prue head off to the fuse panel, but Phoebe follows the spirit board's prompt and heads to the attic. The door is locked but suddenly opens and Phoebe is guided to a wooden chest. Opening the chest, she discovers a large, ancient book called the \"Book of Shadows\". Unaware of the powers involved, but overcome with curiosity, she reads a page aloud, which mentions three sisters and the power of three having the active powers of an ancestor named Melinda Warren. The spell bestows Phoebe with premonitions, Piper with molecular immobilization, and Prue with telekinesis. Prue tells Phoebe that the book is of witchcraft but they believe that nothing has changed. In fact, the photo of the three sisters has changed, as they have magically moved closer to each other, but the sisters don't see it. In the morning Prue is confronted by her ex Roger, who is also her boss. He removes her from the project that she had been looking after. Prue quits her job but her anger unwittingly causes her to make his pen explode and his necktie to nearly strangle him. Piper runs out of time and can't complete her dish until she accidentally freezes the chef of the restaurant which allows her to finish the sauce off and get the job. Whilst Phoebe is riding her bike, she gets a premonition of two boys on roller skates being involved in a car accident and she prevents the accident by causing herself to have an accident.\n\nPrue still has problems accepting that they are witches and sees her power in action for the first time when putting cream in her drink. While Prue is in a pharmacy looking for aspirin, Phoebe observes that Prue uses her power when she is angry. Phoebe winds her sister up over Roger and their Dad, which causes Prue to knock most of the stock off the shelves. Meanwhile, Piper is on a date with Jeremy, who is actually a warlock that steals the powers of good witches. Jeremy says that he knew all about them the whole time, hence why he started dating Piper six months beforehand when their grandmother went into hospital. He then shows Piper the powers of the witch whom he killed at the start of the episode. While Jeremy attempts to stab Piper with an athame, she freezes him and escapes before telling Prue and Phoebe what happened. The trio then create a potion which injures Jeremy and Phoebe has a premonition that he has been wounded but not defeated. After trying to blockade themselves from Jeremy, Prue remembers the inscription on the spirit board and the sisters hold hands chanting \"The power of three will set us free\" until he is killed.\n\nIn 2016, Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV ran a series of \"Charmed\" articles in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the series finale. The first was a complete season review of season one, including the pilot episode, in which Gavin comments that the episode is a \"classic\", and that he \"loved the episode\".\n\n"}

The settlement abuts the Ein Hatzeva bloc of agricultural villages on the opposite side of Highway 90 near the Jordanian border, and is within the boundaries of the Arava Regional Council.\nOriginally the site of the \"Ein Husub\" police station during the British Mandate of Palestine, the location was captured by the Israel Defense Forces in 1948. The village of Ir Ovot was founded in 1967, in an area deserted apart from a small military base and roadside cafe on the way to Eilat. It was founded by a group of Messianic Americans led by former law student and court clerk Simcha Pearlmutter, a Jew from Miami, Florida who claimed to have received a revelation from God.\n\nFirst observed and documented by Alois Musil in 1902, the Roman fortress was identified on Fritz Frank's 1932 travels in the region. In 1934, Nelson Glueck identified the location as a Nabatæan caravanserai coopted by the Romans, but the site's true significance was noted by Benjamin Mazar and Michael Avi-Yonah's 1950 discovery of sherds from the First Temple period. In the 1960s, it was first suggested by Yohanan Aharoni that the site might be the same as Tamar of the Book of Ezekiel and , and Eusebius of Caesarea's \"Tamara\".\n\nThe first salvage excavation took place in 1972 under Aharoni and Rudolph Cohen's direction, but much of the work was carried out by Cohen, Yigal Yisrael, and recently Tali Erickson-Gini, following the 1986 involvement of \"Blossoming Rose\" in partnership with the Israel Antiquities Authority, Jewish National Fund and Tamar Regional Council. Known in addition to Tamar as the Hatzeva Fortress, or alternatively identified with Solomon's Tadmor, the site has six strata which indicate Early Israelite, Nabatæan, Edomite, Roman, and Early Arab occupations. It includes a 1,000-year-old shade tree, and the largest \"Paliurus spina-christi\" in Israel.\n\nThe area was used for training crews in site conservation before their work on the Masada site.\n\nThe earliest remains, dating to the Solomonic period of the 10th century BCE, resembles other contemporary Negev plateau fortresses and included period Negevite pottery. Ranging from tenth to sixth centuries BCE, Negevite was also uncovered at Tel Kadesh Barnea and ; it is probable that this level was destroyed by Pharaoh Shishaq like other sites of that period.\n\nThe second layer consists of a very large Iron Age fortification surrounded by a casemate wall. This First Temple period building of the Kingdom of Judah is almost as large as contemporary cities such as Tel Be'er Sheva, and is four times larger than other fortified Negev cities at 10,000 square metres.\n\nExcavation revealed a four-chambered, north-facing gate complex near the northeastern corner and three storerooms, a pair of granaries, a moat and a defensive wall. The city was possibly constructed by King Amaziah of Judah, an 8th-century BCE ruler who fortified the Judean kingdom and went to war with neighbouring Edom in the northern Arabah, or his son Uzziah whose construction of towers in the desert is mentioned by the second Book of Chronicles.\n\nA third fortress from the Late First Temple period from the 7th–6th centuries BCE was found, though because only the walls' foundations remain, reconstructing the floor plan has been difficult. However, an eastern wall with two towers set apart was reconstructed.\n\nA pit full of smashed clay and stone, which were reassembled into 74 cultic vessels, was also found, indicating a probable Edomite shrine. Censers, chalices, altars and human figurines were unearthed outside the fortress wall on the site's northern edge in 1993, near the foundations of a small building that seems to have been a shrine. Some of the sherds resemble vessels found in an Edomite shrine at Horvat Qitmit, about to the northwest. A circular stone stamp seal discovered inside the fortress, picturing two men in long robes on either side of an altar, provides another indicator of Edomite origin. The pit recoveries dating to the end of the seventh century could possibly have been destroyed in the campaign of religious reforms spearheaded by King Josiah mentioned in Book of Kings II.\n\nEvidence of Roman administrative and military presence is plentiful, and the junction of the east–west Incense Road to Gaza and the north–south route to the Red Sea probably made it an economically valuable frontier outpost.\n\nThe Roman fortress' layout is similar to other imperial outposts in the region. An official Latin inscription that dates several area strongholds to the 3rd century CE was discovered on a large limestone slab at nearby Yotvata bears. This site was the largest in the area at , and included four projecting towers on the fortress' corners. Artefacts tell of probably destruction in the middle of the fourth century CE, perhaps by a 344 earthquake, though it was promptly rebuilt with improved, stone flooring and again destroyed two decades later, probably from an earthquake in 363.\n\nA thermæ and caravanserai of the same period were also found, and is similar to the thermæ at Ashkelon and others in the nearby country. A row of rooms from an earlier, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE fortress revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and other vessels.\n\nA building fragment stratum from the Early Arab period was uncovered immediately beneath the ground surface, along with evidence of a farm located above the Roman thermæ's remains and below the modern structures.\n\n\n"}

Standing at , he played the shooting guard position. He is currently a commentator for the Sacramento Kings on NBC Sports California.\n\nBorn in Seattle, Washington, Christie is the son of John Malone and Norma Christie. He was raised in Seattle by his mother Norma Christie.\n\nHe began playing street ball at a young age, but it was under the guidance of Mark Morris coach Dave Denny that his game took off.\n\n\"Once I came there, and I put that with the street side of basketball, I noticed great strides\", he said. \"I was learning the basics of basketball—the things you don't learn on the playground.\"\n\nChristie played basketball in eighth grade at Cascade Middle School and for Mark Morris High School during his freshman and sophomore years. He had moved to Longview to live with his father, former Mark Morris track star John Malone. He later attended Seattle's Rainier Beach High School. In 1988, his senior year at Beach he led the school's varsity boys' basketball team to their first-ever Washington state championship. \n\nHe then went on to Pepperdine University. (studying sociology), where he gained national exposure. While at Pepperdine, he was twice named WCC Player of the Year (1991, 1992). He also led the Waves to the NCAA Tournament those two years, averaging over 19 points per game during his final two seasons.\n\nChristie was selected 17th overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. However, because of contract difficulties, he never played for the Sonics and was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, along with Benoit Benjamin, in exchange for Sam Perkins later that season, where in his first game his name was spelled incorrectly on his jersey as \"Chrisite.\" He was used sparingly in Los Angeles. In 1994, the Lakers traded him to the New York Knicks for two second-round draft picks. Again, he did not play often. In 1996, he was again traded mid-season, this time to the Toronto Raptors in a package with Herb Williams, for Willie Anderson and Victor Alexander. He stayed with the Raptors until the conclusion of the season in 2000. By then, Christie had picked up his scoring and had been a consistent starter for the Raptors.\n\nAt the end of the 2000 season, Christie was traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for forward Corliss Williamson. In Sacramento, Christie became the Kings' popular starting shooting guard and developed into one of the league's best defenders, perennially named to the NBA All-Defensive Team; also he was recognized as one of the best 3pt-shooters during this time. Alongside Jason Williams, Peja Stojaković, Chris Webber, and Vlade Divac, the Kings starting five would become known as \"The Greatest Show on Court.\" Christie's defense helped the Kings rise in the NBA ranks, becoming a perennial playoff contender and eventually a championship contender, leading the league in wins in 2001–02.\n\nIn 2005, however, he was traded to the Orlando Magic for Cuttino Mobley and Michael Bradley. Christie left the Kings as second all-time in total steals. He was unhappy about the trade and played only a few games before being sidelined with bone spurs. Following Christie's ankle surgery, the Orlando Magic released him on August 11, 2005 under the new NBA collective bargaining agreement one-time amnesty clause. Christie signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks shortly thereafter.\n\nDue to a slow healing surgically repaired left ankle, Christie was waived by the Dallas Mavericks on November 25, 2005, signaling his impending retirement. He had left the team the week prior to have his surgically repaired left ankle examined by his personal physician. In seven games with the Dallas Mavericks, Christie averaged 3.7 points and 2.0 assists. In January 2007, Christie attempted a comeback when he signed a 10-day contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. After the All-Star break, Christie, on his second 10-day contract, decided to part ways with the team.\n\nIn 2014, Christie was named to a team assembled by Dennis Rodman as part of his \"basketball diplomacy\" effort in North Korea with the job of playing an exhibition match against the North Korean Senior National Team to celebrate the birthday of Kim Jong-un.\n\nChristie, and his wife Jackie, have three children. In 2002, \"The New York Times\" published a feature story in which Doug and his wife Jackie spoke about their amazing marriage and committed lifestyle. The couple remarry every year on their wedding anniversary, complete with guests and festivities.\n\nChristie is a devout Christian.\n\nIn 2006, BET's BET J launched the reality show \"The Christies Committed\", featuring the Christies' struggle to balance family and celebrity life.\n\nJackie is also featured on VH1's reality TV show's \"\" and the main series \"Basketball Wives\".\n\nDuring a 2012 appearance on \"The Rickey Smiley Show\", Jackie Christie joked that the couple would soon be producing an adult film.\n\n\n"}

The name is an acronym of the four primary aspects of the disorder: Macrosomia (excessive birth weight), Obesity, Macrocephaly (excessive head size) and Ocular abnormalities. It is unknown if it is a life-limiting condition. MOMO syndrome was first diagnosed in 1993 by Professor Célia Priszkulnik Koiffmann, a Brazilian researcher in the Genetic and Clinical Studies of neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThis syndrome's acronym is an intended pun. It refers to the traditionally tall and obese king of Carnivals, Momus—Rei Momo in Portuguese.\n\nAlong with the four aspects of the disorder that give it its name, there are also other common symptoms:\n\nThe ocular abnormalities are generally retinal coloboma and nystagmus.\n\nBecause MOMO is such a rare disorder, very few studies have been conducted into its causes. Current research suggests that it is linked to a de novo (new) autosomal dominant mutation.\nArchie Thompson was born in 2002 in Icklesham, England and weighed 8 lb 4 oz (3740 g). By 15 months his weight had increased to 4 stone (56 lb; 25 kg) and by 24 months it was up to 6 stone (84 pounds; 38 kg). The condition placed a large strain on his heart and lungs. The Thompson family were featured in a documentary for Five first shown on 3 October 2004. It has since aired on Discovery Fit & Health in the United States.\n\nDanielle Falan, from São Paulo, Brazil, is one of the oldest surviving sufferers of MOMO syndrome. At age 17 she was featured in the Archie Thompson documentary as her mother traveled to visit her in Brazil. Falan attended school as normal, and hopes to attend college.\n\nSix other cases have been diagnosed, in Italy, in Brazil , two in Germany, , in Cuba, 2018 Diorkeblin Hernández Durruthy , and in Poland.

{"id": "1964813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964813", "title": "NewLISP", "text": "NewLISP\n\nnewLISP is a scripting language which is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages. It was designed and developed by Lutz Mueller. newLISP is free and open-source software released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\nnewLISP design is influenced by the two main Lisp dialects, Common Lisp and Scheme, and by other languages like Pascal and C. newLISP originated in 1991 and was originally developed on a Sun-4 workstation. It later moved to Windows 3.0, where version 1.3 was released on CompuServe around 1993, then became available as a Windows graphical user interface (GUI) graphics-capable application and a DOS console application (both 16-bit). In 1995, with the release of Windows 95, newLISP moved to 32-bit.\n\nIn April 1999, newLISP was ported to Linux; some of its core algorithms were rewritten, and all Windows-specific code removed. newLISP was released as an open-source software project licensed under the GPL, and development on Windows stopped after version 6.0.25. During the first half of 2001, newLISP was ported back to Windows on the Cygwin platform without graphics abilities. In the second half of 2001, a cross-platform Tcl/Tk frontend named newLISP-tk was released around version 6.3.0. In 2006, 64-bit precision was introduced for integer arithmetic and for some operations on files in version 9.0.\n\nSince the release of 6.5 in mid-2002, development has been very active, and many new features have been added.\n\nnewLISP attempts to provide a fast, powerful, cross-platform, full-featured scripting version of the language Lisp while using only a modest system resources such as data storage (e.g., disk space) and memory.\n\nIt provides Lisp features such as lists, symbol processing, function mapping, anonymous functions (lambda expressions), s-expressions (excluding improper lists), and macros. It also provides the functions expected of a modern scripting language, including supporting regular expressions, XML, Unicode (UTF-8), networking via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), matrix and array processing, advanced math, statistics and Bayesian statistical analysis, mathematical finance, and distributed computing.\n\nnewLISP runs on the operating systems Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), Linux, macOS, Solaris, and Windows. It supports MYSQL, SQLite and ODBC database access, Common Gateway Interface (CGI), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP) 3, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and XML remote procedure call (XML-RPC). It can run in server mode as a daemon.\n\nnewLISP supports namespaces termed \"contexts\", which can be assigned to variables and passed to functions, but which are associated with globally unique symbols, limiting their use as first-class citizens (objects). A prototype-based object-oriented style of programming is possible in newLISP, using contexts as prototypes to construct objects. Variables inside contexts do not interfere with variables of the same name in other contexts, but inside a context, variables behave according to the rules of dynamic scoping.\n\nnewLISP uses dynamic scoping. When a function is called, that function can see all variables of its caller, its caller's caller, and so on, within the same context or namespace. It supports both explicitly and implicitly defined local dynamic variables that shadow variables with the same name from the outer environment, thus preventing accidental use or change of the variables from caller environment. Parameter variables of the called function automatically shadow the caller's variable environment. Globally, variables can be grouped in separate namespaces.\n\nnewLISP uses a method of automatic memory management different from traditional garbage collection schemes, termed one reference only (ORO) memory management. Each variable is referenced only by its context, and each context is referenced globally.\n\nSharing of subobjects among objects, cyclic structures, or multiple variables pointing to the same object are unsupported in newLISP. Objects are copied when stored in data structures or passed to functions, except for certain built-in functions. The exceptions are symbols and contexts, which are shared instead of copied, and thus can be used for indirection. Symbols and contexts are globally named and are deleted explicitly; deleting a symbol or context scans all other objects to replace references to it with codice_1.\n\nnewLISP graphical user interface (GUI) server (newLISP-GS) is a Java-based Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) server providing a graphical programming interface. A newLISP-GS based development environment is included in newLISP binary distributions, and GTK-server, OpenGL, and Tcl/Tk-based programming interfaces are available.\n\nAny newLISP version allows building executable files, portable applications, for deployment which are self-contained and need no installing.\n\nnewLISP has an import function, which allows importing functions from a dynamic-link library (DLL) on Windows API Win32, or from a shared library on Linux or Unix.\n\nWeb frameworks available for newLISP include Dragonfly and Rockets.\n\n"}

The team that developed SEAC was organized by Samuel N. Alexander. SEAC was demonstrated in April 1950 and was dedicated on June 1950; it is claimed to be the first fully operational stored-program electronic computer in the US.\n\nBased on EDVAC, SEAC used only 747 vacuum tubes (a small number for the time) eventually expanded to 1,500 tubes. It had 10,500 germanium diodes which performed all of the logic functions (see the article diode–transistor logic for the working principles of diode logic), later expanded to 16,000 diodes. It was the first computer to do most of its logic with solid-state devices. The tubes were used for amplification, inversion and storing information in dynamic flip-flops.\nThe machine used 64 acoustic delay lines to store 512 words of memory, with each word being 45 bits in size. The clock rate was kept low (1 MHz).\n\nThe computer's instruction set consisted of only 11 types of instructions: fixed-point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; comparison, and input & output.

Several subplots pop up in the story - moral conflicts, the power of the human spirit triumphing over adversity and the meaning of life are some themes.\n\nSet and filmed in Los Angeles, California, and Seoul, South Korea, between February 13 and April 6, 1989, \"Best of the Best\" was released on November 10, 1989.\n\nAlexander Grady, a widower and father is chosen to represent the United States of America in an international martial arts tournament against Team Korea. Once a rising star in the martial arts world, he suffered a shoulder injury that forced him into retirement. Also chosen for the team are Tommy Lee, a highly skilled martial arts instructor; Travis Brickley, an extremely brash fighter with a short fuse; Virgil Keller, a devout Buddhist; and Sonny Grasso, a streetwise fighter from Detroit. Despite being coached by veteran trainer Frank Couzo, their chances of winning are virtually non-existent, as the Koreans train all year long, enjoy lucrative financial support from their nation, and have—on at least one occasion—killed a competitor in the ring. To win, they will need to be the best technically, physically, and mentally.\n\nAs training begins, the team struggles to bond as Travis antagonizes them. Given the pressure, the American team hires a second assistant coach, Catherine Wade, whose spiritual approach to training clashes with Couzo's more aggressive coaching techniques. Tommy is disturbed when his opponent is revealed to be Dae Han, Team Korea's best fighter who was responsible for killing Tommy's brother in a similar tournament. Couzo hopes that Tommy's desire for revenge will give him the necessary aggression to win, while Wade is more concerned about Tommy's mental state. With time and training, the team begins to bond and to earn each other's respect.\n\nCouzo cuts Alex from the team when he breaks the rigid training regimen to visit his son, who had been hit by a car; later, Tommy quits after knocking out Virgil with a powerful spinning side kick during practice. Travis and the others persuade Couzo to reinstate Alex, and Tommy eventually rejoins the team after a change of heart.\n\nIn the first two matches of the tournament, Virgil and Sonny are out-classed by their Korean opponents. Travis does his best to psyche up the team with his brash attitude, going point for point with his Korean counterpart, but loses in a tie-breaker brick-breaking competition. Alex dominates his match with his opponent, Sae Jin Kwon, but takes a devastating axe-kick to his shoulder which dislocates it. Instead of giving up, he implores Tommy to \"pop\" the shoulder back into place and resumes the fight, ultimately defeating his opponent with one arm. Finally, Tommy faces Dae Han. After a slow start, Tommy gets the upper hand and delivers a series of blows that forces Dae Han solely on the defensive. As the match nears its end, Tommy has brought the American team within two points of outright victory, and Dae Han can barely stand. Tommy prepares to finish the fight, but knowing that Dae Han would not survive the attack, his coaches and teammates dissuade him. Tommy hesitates and lets the clock run out, saving the man's life but forfeiting the overall victory. Couzo consoles Tommy afterwards, telling him, \"You won that match, don't ever forget that\".\n\nAt the medal ceremony, Dae Han unexpectedly approaches Tommy and praises him for his honorable act. In tears, he then apologizes for the death of Tommy's brother, and in return offers himself as a brother. Tommy accepts, and Dae Han places his medal around Tommy's neck before the two men embrace. Sae Jin Kwon then walks up to Alex and states his long-time admiration for him as a fighter, before also handing over his medal. The other members of Team Korea then follow suit, awarding their medals to their respective American opponents.\n\n\nOriginally released as a vinyl record album, cassette and CD, re-released on CD in 2004.\n\n\nProfessional critics were universally negative about the film, although it inspired several sequels and has gained a following over the years. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 26 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". In his book \"Iceman: My Fighting Life\", UFC champion Chuck Liddell cites \"Best of the Best\" as his personal favorite martial arts film. Movie historian Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, dismissed the picture as \"Yet another \"Rocky\" clone\" and \"An appalling waste of talent...a top-drawer cast in search of a script.\"\n\nRhee revealed in an interview with The Action Elite that he's planning on rebooting the franchise with a new cast and Rhee will produce the new film.\n\n"}
{"id": "1964908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964908", "title": "Hitler's Pope", "text": "Hitler's Pope\n\nHitler's Pope is a book published in 1999 by the British journalist and author John Cornwell that examines the actions of Eugenio Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII, before and during the Nazi era, and explores the charge that he assisted in the legitimization of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime in Germany, through the pursuit of a Reichskonkordat in 1933. The book is critical of Pius' conduct during the Second World War, arguing that he did not do enough, or speak out enough, against the Holocaust. Cornwell argues that Pius's entire career as the nuncio to Germany, Cardinal Secretary of State, and Pope, was characterized by a desire to increase and centralize the power of the Papacy, and that he subordinated opposition to the Nazis to that goal. He further argues that Pius was antisemitic and that this stance prevented him from caring about the European Jews.\n\nVarious commentators have challenged the book's leading ideas, or challenged factual assertions contained within it. Holocaust historian Martin Gilbert credits Pius XII with various actions which saved Jews, and notes that the Nazi security forces referred to him as the \"mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals\". Pius XII maintained links to the German Resistance and in the assessment of historian Frank J. Coppa writing for the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", Cornwell's depiction of Pius XII as antisemitic lacks \"credible substantiation\".\n\nThe author has been praised for attempting to bring into the open the debate on the Catholic Church's relationship with the Nazis, but also accused of making unsubstantiated claims and ignoring positive evidence. The author has moderated some of his allegations since publication of the book. In 2004, Cornwell stated that Pius XII \"had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany. ... But even if his prevarications and silences were performed with the best of intentions, he had an obligation in the postwar period to explain those actions\". He similarly stated in 2008 that Pius XII's \"scope for action was severely limited\", but that \"[n]evertheless, due to his ineffectual and diplomatic language in respect of the Nazis and the Jews, I still believe that it was incumbent on him to explain his failure to speak out after the war. This he never did.\" In 2009 he described Pacelli as effectively a \"fellow traveller\" of the Nazis.\n\nCornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius's beatification process as well as to many documents from Eugenio Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the seventy-five year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives. Cornwell's work has received both praise and criticism. Eamon Duffy wrote that Cornwell's \"gripping and impassioned account\" had presented \"an indictment that [could not] be ignored\" and Saul Friedländer that Cornwell had demonstrated how \"Pius XII brought the authoritarianism and the centralization of his predecessors to their most extreme stage.\" Susan Zuccotti's \"\" (2000) and Michael Phayer's \"The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965\" (2000) are critical of both Cornwell and Pius XII. Ronald J. Rychlak's \"Hitler, the War and the Pope\" is critical as well but defends Pius XII in light of his own access to recent documents.\n\nCornwell researched the conduct of Pacelli, both while he served as nuncio to Germany and after he was made Pope; some of Cornwell's principal resources were the Vatican archives. Cornwell stated that he reassured the archivists he was on the side of the pope as the God's representative on earth and, acting in good faith, he had \"generous access to unseen material\". He concluded that:\nCornwell alleged that, from at least his early '40s onward, Pacelli had antisemitic tendencies. He traced the earliest manifestation of these antisemitic tendencies to an incident in 1917 in which Pacelli refused to help facilitate the exportation of palm fronds from Italy to be used by German Jews in Munich to celebrate the festival of Tabernacles. Cornwell argued that, although this incident was \"small in itself\", it \"belies subsequent claims that Pacelli had a great love of the Jewish religion and was always motivated by its best interests.\"\n\nCornwell stated he uncovered a \"time bomb\" letter signed and personally annotated by Pacelli that had been lying in the Vatican archives since 1919, regarding the actions of communist revolutionaries in Munich. Regarding this letter, Cornwell stated \"The repeated references to the Jewishness of these individuals, amid the catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness, gives an impression of stereotypical anti-Semitic contempt\". Cornwell asserts that the letter from Pacelli to Pietro Gaspam [sic Gaparri ] portrays Jews in an unfavorable light and associates them with the Bolshevik revolution.\n\nIn the assessment of Frank J. Coppa, writing for \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", Cornwell's depiction of Pacelli as antisemitic lacks \"credible substantiation\". Coppa writes: \"though Pius's wartime public condemnations of racism and genocide were cloaked in generalities, he did not turn a blind eye to the suffering but chose to use diplomacy to aid the persecuted. It is impossible to know if a more forthright condemnation of the Holocaust would have proved more effective in saving lives, though it probably would have better assured his reputation.\"\n\nCornwell asserts that Pacelli was a strong proponent of the absolute leadership principle. He writes that, \"More than any other Vatican official of the century, [Pacelli] promoted the modern ideology of autocratic papal control, the highly centralized, dictatorial authority.\"\n\nCornwell argued that Pacelli's antisemitism combined with his drive to promote papal absolutism inexorably led him to collaboration with fascist leaders, a collaboration which led to what Cornwell characterizes as \"the betrayal of Catholic democratic politics in Germany\".\n\nCornwell describes this collaboration with fascist leaders as starting in 1929 with the concordat with Mussolini known as the Lateran Treaty, and followed by the concordat with Hitler known as the Reichskonkordat.\n\nCornwell recounts that Eugenio Pacelli's brother, Francesco, successfully negotiated a concordat with Mussolini as part of an agreement known as the Lateran Treaty. A precondition of the negotiations had involved the dissolution of the parliamentary Catholic Italian Popular Party. Cornwell claims that Pius XI disliked political Catholicism because it was beyond his control. According to Cornwell, a succession of Popes took the view that Catholic party politics \"brought democracy into the church by the back door\". Cornwell asserts that the result of the demise of the Popular Party was the \"wholesale shift of Catholics into the Fascist Party and the collapse of democracy in Italy\".\n\nCornwell asserts that Pius XI and his new secretary of state, Eugenio Pacelli, were determined that at a time that saw the church persecuted by Communist and socialist regimes from the Soviet Union to Mexico and later Spain, no accommodation was to be reached with Communists. At the same time, Cornwell alleges that Pius XI and Pacelli were more open to collaboration with totalitarian movements and regimes of the right.\n\nCornwell asserts that Hitler was determined to conclude a concordat with the Vatican similar to the one that Mussolini had negotiated. According to Cornwell, Hitler was obsessed by a fear of German Catholics who, politically united by the Center Party, had defeated Otto von Bismarck's Kulturkampf, during the \"culture struggle\" against the Catholic Church in the 1870s. According to Cornwell, Hitler was \"convinced that his movement could succeed only if political Catholicism and its democratic networks were eliminated\".\n\nA major response to \"Hitler's Pope\" came from University of Mississippi law professor Ronald J. Rychlak in his 2000 book on the subject, \"Hitler, the War, and the Pope\". Rychlak was acknowledged by the Vatican to have been given special access to their closed archives for his research.\n\nRychlak disagreed with Cornwell's claim of having found a \"time bomb letter\", arguing that the letter in question had actually been written not by Pacelli but by his assistant, and moreover had been fully published and discussed in a 1992 book by Emma Fattorini (a highly respected docent at the University of Rome). With respect to Cornwell's allegations of antisemitism, Rychlak stated that \"When Pius XII died in 1958, there were tributes from virtually every Jewish group around the world\".\n\nRychlak also alleged that Cornwell manipulated the photograph on the front cover of the American edition of the book, and incorrectly dated the photo as having been taken in March 1939, the month that Pacelli was made Pope. Rychlak charged that this had been done deliberately in order to give the impression that Pius had just visited Hitler when, in fact, the photo had been taken in 1927 as Pius was leaving a reception held for German President Paul von Hindenburg. Robert Royal has also repeated this allegation.\n\nIn his 2005 book \"The Myth of Hitler's Pope\", the historian and rabbi David G. Dalin also countered Cornwell. Dalin suggested that \"Yad Vashem\" should honor Pope Pius XII as a \"Righteous Gentile,\" concluding that \"[t]he anti-papal polemics of ex-seminarians like Garry Wills and John Cornwell ... of ex-priests like James Carroll, and or other lapsed or angry liberal Catholics exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today.\" Dalin called the book's conclusions \"unverified\" and \"strongly anti-religious\". Eugene Fisher, who has a PhD in Hebrew culture and education, said it was a \"sad commentary on the secular media that this anti-Catholic screed was ever published\".\n\nIn his book \"\", Philip Jenkins said that \"Hitler's Pope\" could not be understood except as a series of \"very low blows against the modern Catholic Church, and specifically the papacy of John Paul II.\"\n\nKen Woodward, writing in \"Newsweek\", stated that \"Hitler's Pope\" has \"errors of fact and ignorance of context [that] appear on almost every page.\"\n\nIn an historical assessment of Pope Pius XII, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" addressed Cornwell's book in the following terms: \"John Cornwell's controversial book on Pius, Hitler's Pope (1999), characterized him as antisemitic. [The depiction], however, lack[s] credible substantiation\". The Encyclopedia further assessed his role in aiding Jews during the Holocaust as follows: \"Although he allowed the national hierarchies to assess and respond to the situation in their countries, he established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to, and information about, thousands of war refugees and instructed the church to provide discreet aid to Jews, which quietly saved thousands of lives\".\n\n2013 book \"Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism\" by Rychlak and Pacepa criticises Cornwell and suggests the basis for many allegations were leaks from the Soviets as an attempt to undermine Catholic influence and thus weaken it as an anti-Communist enemy.\n\nAccording to a 2004 article in \"The Economist\", Cornwell's historical work has not always been \"fair-minded\" and \"Hitler's Pope\" specifically \"lacked balance\". The article goes on to state that Cornwell, \"chastened\", had admitted as much himself, in a later work, \"The Pontiff in Winter\", citing the following quote as evidence:\n\nIn a more recent interview, Mr. Cornwell stated:\nIn 2009 he described Cardinal Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) as being an example of a \"fellow traveller\" of the Nazis who was willing to accept the generosity of Hitler in the educational sphere (more schools, teachers and pupil places), so long as the Church withdrew from the social and political sphere, at the same time as Jews were being dismissed from universities and Jewish pupil places were being reduced. For this he considers Pacelli as effectively being in collusion with the Nazi cause, if not by intent. He further argues that Monsignor Kass, who was involved in negotiations for the Reichskonkordat, and at that time the head of the Roman Catholic Centre Party, persuaded his party members, with the acquiescence of Pacelli, in the summer of 1933 to enable Hitler to acquire dictatorial powers. He argues that the Catholic Centre Party vote was decisive in the adoption of dictatorial powers by Hitler and that the party's subsequent dissolution was at Pacelli's prompting.\n\n\n"}

It is the only school of Lake Forest Community High School District 115, which serves the communities of Lake Forest, Lake Bluff, Knollwood, and smaller parts of Mettawa and North Chicago. It is fed by Lake Bluff Middle School, Lake Forest Country Day School, Saint Mary's, and Deer Path Middle School.\n\nThe current LFHS was built in 1935. The most recent addition took place in 2008, and was responsible for the adding of a commons area, a new lunchroom and a music wing as well as other minor adjustments.\n\nThe high school has both a studio theater and auditorium, as well as a television studio with 5,500 videotapes. It also has computer labs, a computerized library with CD-ROM retrieval, student publication facilities, photography lab, and special education facilities. Sports facilities include a field house, climbing wall, swimming pool with a diving well and student gym.\n\nThe grounds include a large front lawn (used for field hockey, lacrosse, and ultimate) and a full-sized track and football field with 2 sets of bleachers. Because the school is situated very close to residential areas, the City of Lake Forest does not permit the school's football team to use floodlights, effectively prohibiting night games; however, in 2006, the city did allow the school to rent lights for a one-time night game. A 2007 referendum relocated the school's football facilities to the school's west campus, where the use of floodlights is not prohibited. The referendum passed by an overwhelming 2/3 majority, and renovations took place in two phases. The first phase, completed during the 2007/2008 school year, included the addition of a music wing, and renovation of the west campus including construction of a Varsity field. The second phase, completed in August 2008, included academic renovations at the east campus with a brand new dining room, a large atrium or \"The Commons\" and library, and construction of administrative offices at the west campus, additionally at West campus a new football field complete with floodlights and astro turf was built, now allowing night games. Prior to this, a first referendum was passed on November 7, 2006 unanimously by the Lake Forest High School Board of Education. This referendum was later passed on to the rest of the community and appropriated $54 million to be paid back over the next 20 years.\n\nIn 2005, Lake Forest graduated 98.9% of its senior class. It has been included in the \"Top million\" and \"Most Successful\" lists of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Parade magazine. The average class size is 19.3. Lake Forest has made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievements Examination, a state test part of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\nIn 2010, Lake Forest had a mean ACT composite score of 26.5—one of the highest in the state. The national average was 21.1. SAT mean scores were 601 in Critical Reading; 621 in Math; and 594 in Writing.\n\nThe average tenure of faculty members is 11.3 years with 96% of the faculty holding a master's degree or higher. There are 156 certified staff members, creating a student to staff ratio of 12.7\n\nAlong with the typical course offerings, Lake Forest High School also covers 26 AP classes and 40 Honors classes. The Advanced Placement courses offered include: Biology, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Chemistry, Computer Programming, Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Science, French V, French VI, German IV, Latin IV, Latin V, Literary Analysis and Criticism, Modern European History, Music Theory, Psychology, Physics C, Political Science, Spanish V, Statistics, Studio Art, United States History, and World History.\n\nThe Lake Forest High School Foundation was established in 2002 and adopted the mission statement of providing funding for resources necessary to support and enrich the educational experience of the students, faculty and staff of Lake Forest High School. This Foundation is there to provide Lake Forest High School's students and faculty with the funding they need to become more educated. The Lake Forest High School Foundation has given over 220 grants which totals to about $1,600,000.\n\nLake Forest High School has won 71 state championships in athletics, 43 since 2000.

{"id": "1964917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964917", "title": "Banu Qurayza", "text": "Banu Qurayza\n\nThe Banu Qurayza (, ; alternate spellings include Quraiza, Qurayzah, Quraytha, and the archaic Koreiza) were a Jewish tribe which lived in northern Arabia, at the oasis of Yathrib (now known as Medina), until the 7th century, when they were massacred and enslaved following the Invasion of Banu Qurayza by Muslim forces under Muhammad.\n\nJewish tribes reportedly arrived in Hijaz in the wake of the Jewish-Roman wars and introduced agriculture, putting them in a culturally, economically and politically dominant position. However, in the 5th century, the Banu Aws and the Banu Khazraj, two Arab tribes that had arrived from Yemen, gained dominance. When these two tribes became embroiled in conflict with each other, the Jewish tribes, now clients or allies of the Arabs, fought on different sides, the Qurayza siding with the Aws.\n\nIn 622, the Islamic prophet Muhammad arrived at Yathrib from Mecca and reportedly established a pact between the conflicting parties. While the city found itself at war with Muhammad's native Meccan tribe of the Quraysh, tensions between the growing numbers of Muslims and the Jewish communities mounted.\n\nIn 627, when the Quraysh and their allies besieged the city in the Battle of the Trench, the Qurayza initially tried to remain neutral but eventually entered into negotiations with the besieging army, violating the pact they had agreed to years earlier. Subsequently, the tribe was charged with treason and besieged by the Muslims commanded by Muhammad. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered and their men were beheaded.\n\nThe historicity of this incident has been questioned by Islamic scholars of the Revisionist School of Islamic Studies and by some western specialists.\n\nExtant sources provide no conclusive evidence whether the Banu Qurayza were ethnically Jewish or Arab converts to Judaism. Just like the other Jews of Yathrib, the Qurayza claimed to be of Israelite descent and observed the commandments of Judaism, but adopted many Arab customs and intermarried with Arabs. \nThey were dubbed the \"priestly tribe\" (\"kahinan\" in Arabic from the Hebrew kohanim). Ibn Ishaq, the author of the traditional Muslim biography of Muhammad, traces their genealogy to Aaron and further to Abraham but gives only eight intermediaries between Aaron and the purported founder of the Qurayza tribe.\n\nIn the 5th century CE, the Qurayza lived in Yathrib together with two other major Jewish tribes, the Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Nadir. Al-Isfahani writes in his 10th century collection of Arabic poetry that Jews arrived in Hijaz in the wake of the Jewish-Roman wars; the Qurayza settled in Mahzur, a wadi in Al Harrah. The 15th century Muslim scholar Al-Samhudi lists a dozen other Jewish clans living in the town of which the most important one was Banu Hadl, closely aligned with the Banu Qurayza. The Jews introduced agriculture to Yathrib, growing date palms and cereals, and this cultural and economic advantage enabled the Jews to dominate the local Arabs politically. Al-Waqidi wrote that the Banu Qurayza were people of high lineage and of properties, \"whereas we were but an Arab tribe who did not possess any palm trees nor vineyards, being people of only sheep and camels.\" Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian domination in Hijaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the shah.\n\nIbn Ishaq tells of a conflict between the last Yemenite King of Himyar and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place\". The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognized the Kaaba as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honor it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.\n\nThe situation changed after two Arab tribes named Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj arrived to Yathrib from Yemen. At first, these tribes were clients of the Jews, but toward the end of the 5th century CE, they revolted and became independent. Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aws and the Khazraj. William Montgomery Watt however considers this clientship to be unhistorical prior to 627 and maintains that the Jews retained a measure of political independence after the Arab revolt.\n\nEventually, the Aws and the Khazraj became hostile to each other. They had been fighting possibly for around a hundred years before 620 and at least since 570s. The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj. There are reports of the constant conflict between Banu Qurayza and Banu Nadir, the two allies of Aws, yet the sources often refer to these two tribes as “brothers”. Aws and Khazraj and their Jewish allies fought a total of four wars. The last and bloodiest altercation was the Battle of Bu'ath, the outcome of which was inconclusive.\n\nThe Qurayza appear as a tribe of considerable military importance: they possessed large numbers of weaponry, as upon their surrender 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armor, and 500 shields were later seized by the Muslims. Meir J. Kister notes that these quantities are \"disproportionate relative to the number of fighting men\" and conjectures that the \"Qurayza used to sell (or lend) some of the weapons kept in their storehouses\". He also mentions that the Qurayza were addressed as \"Ahlu al-halqa\" (\"people of the weapons\") by the Quraysh and notes that these weapons \"strengthened their position and prestige in the tribal society\".\n\nThe continuing feud between the Aws and the Khazraj was probably the chief cause for several emissaries to invite Muhammad to Yathrib in order to adjudicate in disputed cases. Ibn Ishaq recorded that after his arrival in 622, Muhammad established a compact, the Constitution of Medina, which committed the Jewish and Muslim tribes to mutual cooperation. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of agreements, of different dates, and that it is not clear when they were made. Watt holds that the Qurayza and Nadir were probably mentioned in an earlier version of the Constitution requiring the parties not to support an enemy against each other.\n\nAside from the general agreements, the chronicles by Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi contain a report that after his arrival, Muhammad signed a special treaty with the Qurayza chief Ka'b ibn Asad. Ibn Ishaq gives no sources, while al-Waqidi refers to Ka’b ibn Malik of Salima, a clan hostile to the Jews, and Mummad ibn Ka’b, the son of a Qurayza boy who was sold into slavery in the aftermath of the siege and subsequently became a Muslim. The sources are suspect of being against the Qurayza and therefore the historicity of this agreement between Muhammad and the Banu Qurayza is open to grave doubt. Among modern historians, R. B. Serjeant supports the historicity of this document and suggests that the Jews knew \"of the penalty for breaking faith with Muhammad\". On the other hand, Norman Stillman argues that the Muslim historians had invented this agreement in order to justify the subsequent treatment of the Qurayza. Watt also rejects the existence of such a special agreement but notes that the Jews were bound by the aforementioned general agreement and by their alliance to the two Arab tribes not to support an enemy against Muhammad. Serjeant agrees with this and opines that the Qurayza were aware of the two parts of a pact made between Muhammad and the Jewish tribes in the confederation according to which \"Jews having their religion and the Muslims having their religion excepting anyone who acts wrongfully and commits crime/acts treacherously/breaks an agreement, for he but slays himself and the people of his house.\"\n\nDuring the first few months after Muhammad's arrival in Medina, the Banu Qurayza were involved in a dispute with the Banu Nadir: The more powerful Nadir rigorously applied \"lex talionis\" against the Qurayza while not allowing it being enforced against themselves. Further, the blood money paid for killing a man of the Qurayza was only half of the blood-money required for killing a man of the Nadir, placing the Qurayza in a socially inferior position. The Qurayza called on Muhammad as arbitrator, who delivered the surah and judged that the Nadir and Qurayza should be treated alike in the application of lex talionis and raised the assessment of the Qurayza to the full amount of blood money.\n\nTensions quickly mounted between the growing numbers of Muslims and Jewish tribes, while Muhammad found himself at war with his native Meccan tribe of the Quraysh. In 624, after his victory over the Meccans in the Battle of Badr, Banu Qaynuqa threatened Muhammad's political position and assaulted a Muslim woman which led to their expulsion from Medina for breaking the peace treaty of Constitution of Medina. The Qurayza remained passive during the whole Qaynuqa affair, apparently because the Qaynuqa were historically allied with the Khazraj, while the Qurayza were the allies of the Aws.\n\nSoon afterwards, Muhammad came into conflict with the Banu Nadir. He had one of the Banu Nadir's chiefs, the poet Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, assassinated and after the Battle of Uhud accused the tribe of treachery and plotting against his life and expelled them from the city. The Qurayza remained passive during this conflict, according to R. B. Serjeant because of the blood money issue related above.\n\nIn 627, the Meccans, accompanied by tribal allies as well as the Banu Nadir - who had been very active in supporting the Meccans - marched against Medina - the Muslim stronghold - and laid siege to it. It is unclear whether their treaty with Muhammad obliged the Qurayza to help him defend Medina, or merely to remain neutral, according to Ramadan, they had signed an agreement of mutual assistance with Muhammad. The Qurayza did not participate in the fighting - according to David Norcliffe, because they were offended by attacks against Jews in Muhammad's preaching - but lent tools to the town's defenders. According to Al-Waqidi, the Banu Qurayza helped the defense effort of Medina by supplying spades, picks, and baskets for the excavation of the defensive trench the defenders of Medina had dug in preparation. According to Watt, the Banu Qurayza \"seem to have tried to remain neutral\" in the battle but later changed their attitude when a Jew from Khaybar persuaded them that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed and though they did not commit any act overtly hostile to Muhammad, according to Watt, they entered into negotiations with the invading army.\n\nIbn Ishaq writes that during the siege, the Qurayza readmitted Huyayy ibn Akhtab, the chief of the Banu Nadir whom Muhammad had exiled and who had instigated the alliance of his tribe with the besieging Quraysh and Ghatafan tribes. According to Ibn Ishaq, Huyayy persuaded the Qurayza chief Ka'b ibn Asad to help the Meccans conquer Medina. Ka'b was, according to Al-Waqidi's account, initially reluctant to break the contract and argued that Muhammad never broke any contract with them or exposed them to any shame, but decided to support the Meccans after Huyayy had promised to join the Qurayza in Medina if the besieging army would return to Mecca without having killed Muhammad. Ibn Kathir and al-Waqidi report that Huyayy tore into pieces the agreement between Ka'b and Muhammad.\n\nRumors of this one-sided renunciation of the pact spread and were confirmed by Muhammad's emissaries, Sa'd ibn Mua'dh and Sa'd ibn Ubadah, leading men of the Aws and Khazraj respectively. Sa'd ibn Mua'dh reportedly issued threats against the Qurayza but was restrained by his colleague. As this would have allowed the besiegers to access the city and thus meant the collapse of the defenders' strategy, Muhammad \"became anxious about their conduct and sent some of the leading Muslims to talk to them; the result was disquieting.\" According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad sent Nuaym ibn Masud, a well-respected elder of the Ghatafan who had secretly converted to Islam, to go to Muhammad's enemies and sow discord among them. Nuaym went to the Qurayza and advised them to join the hostilities against Muhammad only if the besiegers provide hostages from among their chiefs. He then hurried to the invaders and warned them that if the Qurayza asked for hostages, it is because they intended to turn them over to the Medinan defenders. When the representatives of the Quraysh and the Ghatafan came to the Qurayza, asking for support in the planned decisive battle with Muhammad, the Qurayza indeed demanded hostages. The representatives of the besiegers refused, breaking down negotiations and resulting in the Banu Qurayza becoming extremely distrustful of the besieging army. The Qurayza did not take any actions to support them until the besieging forces retreated. Thus the threat of a second front against the defenders never materialised.\n\nAfter the Meccans' withdrawal, Muhammad then led his forces against the Banu Qurayza neighborhood. According to Ibn Ishaq, he had been asked to do so by the angel Gabriel. The Banu Qurayza retreated into their stronghold and endured the siege for 25 days. As their morale waned, Ka'b ibn Asad suggested three alternative ways out of their predicament: embrace Islam; kill their own children and women, then rush out for a charge to either win or die; or make a surprise attack on the Sabbath. The Banu Qurayza accepted none of these alternatives. Instead they asked to confer with Abu Lubaba, one of their allies from the Aws. According to Ibn Ishaq, Abu Lubaba felt pity for the women and children of the tribe who were crying and when asked whether the Qurayza should surrender to Muhammad, advised them to do so. However he also \"made a sign with his hand toward his throat, indicating that [their fate] at the hands of the Prophet would be slaughter\". The next morning, the Banu Qurayza surrendered and the Muslims seized their stronghold and their stores. The men - Ibn Ishaq numbers between 400 and 900 - were bound and placed under the custody of one Muhammad ibn Maslamah, who had killed Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, while the women and children - numbering about 1,000 - were placed under Abdullah ibn Sallam, a former rabbi who had converted to Islam.\n\nThe circumstances of the Qurayza's demise have been related by Ibn Ishaq and other Muslim historians who relied upon his account. According to Watt, Peters and Stillman, the Qurayza surrendered to Muhammad's judgement - a move Watt classifies as unconditional. The Aws, who wanted to honor their old alliance with the Qurayza, asked Muhammad to treat the Qurayza leniently as he had previously treated the Qaynuqa for the sake of Ibn Ubayy. (Arab custom required support of an ally, independent of the ally's conduct to a third party.) Muhammad then suggested to bring the case before an arbitrator chosen from the Aws, to which both the Aws and the Qurayza agreed to. Muhammad then appointed Sa'd ibn Mua'dh to decide the fate of the Jewish tribe.\n\nAccording to Hashmi, Buchanan and Moore, the tribe agreed to surrender on the condition of a Muslim arbitrator of their choosing. According to Khadduri (also cited by Abu-Nimer), \"both parties agreed to submit their dispute to a person chosen by them\" in accordance with the Arabian tradition of arbitration. Muir holds that the Qurayza surrendered on the condition that \"their fate was decided by their allies, the Bani Aws\".\n\nIn all accounts, the appointed arbitrator was Sa'd ibn Mua'dh, a leading man among the Aws. During the Battle of the Trench, he had been one of Muhammad's emissaries to the Qurayza (see above) and now was dying from a wound he had received later in the battle. When Sa'd arrived, his fellow Aws pleaded for leniency towards the Qurayza and on his request pledged that they would abide by his decision. He then decreed that \"the men should be killed, the property divided, and the women and children taken as captives\". Muhammad approved of the ruling, calling it similar to God's judgment. Chiragh Ali argued that this statement may have referred to \"king\" or \"ruler\" rather than God.\nSa'd dismissed the pleas of the Aws, according to Watt because being close to death and concerned with his afterlife, he put what he considered \"his duty to God and the Muslim community\" before tribal allegiance. Tariq Ramadan argues that Muhammad deviated from his earlier, more lenient treatment of prisoners as this was seen \"as sign of weakness if not madness\", Peterson concurs that the Muslims wanted to deter future treachery by setting an example with severe punishment. Lings reports that Sa'ad feared that if expelled, the Qurayza would join the Nadir in the fight against the Muslims.\n\nAccording to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd so as not to pronounce the judgment himself, after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: \"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.\" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.\n\nIbn Ishaq describes the killing of the Banu Qurayza men as follows:\nSeveral accounts note Muhammad's companions as executioners, Ali and Al-Zubayr in particular, and that each clan of the Aws was also charged with killing a group of Qurayza men. Subhash Inamdar argues that this was done in order to avoid the risk of further conflicts between Muhammad and the Aws. According to Inamdar, Muhammad wanted to distance himself from the events and, had he been involved, he would have risked alienating some of the Aws.\n\nIt is also reported that one woman, who had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. Ibn Asakir writes in his \"History of Damascus\" that the Banu Kilab, a clan of Arab clients of the Banu Qurayza, were killed alongside the Jewish tribe.\n\nThree boys of the clan of Hadl, who had been with Qurayza in the strongholds, slipped out before the surrender and converted to Islam. The son of one of them, Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi, gained distinction as a scholar. One or two other men also escaped.\n\nThe spoils of battle, including the enslaved women and children of the tribe, were divided up among the Islamic warriors that had participated in the siege and among the emigrees from Mecca (who had hitherto depended on the help of the Muslims native to Medina.\n\nMohammad collected one-fifth of the booty, which was then redistributed to the Muslims in need, as was customary. As part of his share of the spoils, Muhammad selected one of the women, Rayhana, for himself and took her as part of his booty. Muhammad offered to free and marry her and according to some sources she accepted his proposal. She is said to have later become a Muslim.\n\nSome of the women and children of the Banu Qurayza who were enslaved by the Muslims were later bought by Jews, in particular the Banu Nadir. Peterson argues that this is because the Nadir felt responsible for the Qurayza's fate due to the role of their chieftain in the events.\n\nAccording to Islamic traditions, the Qur'an briefly refers to the incident in Surah , yet it is historically doubtful whether the Qur'an really refers to this event. Muslim jurists have looked upon Surah as a justification of the treatment of the Banu Qurayza, arguing that the Qurayza broke their pact with Muhammad, and thus Muhammad was justified in repudiating his side of the pact and killing the Qurayza en masse.\n\nArab Muslim theologians and historians have either viewed the incident as \"the punishment of the Medina Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old\" or offered a political, rather than religious, explanation.\n\nIn the 8th and early 9th century many Muslim jurists, such as Ash-Shafii, based their judgments and decrees supporting collective punishment for treachery on the accounts of the demise of the Qurayza, with which they were well acquainted. However, the proceedings of Muhammad with regard to the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were not taken as a model for the relationship of Muslim states toward its Jewish subjects.\n\nIn his 1861 biography of Muhammad Sir William Muir argued that the massacre cannot be justified by political necessity and \"casts an odious blot upon the prophet's name\". Leone Caetani argued that the judgement was in fact dictated by Muhammad, making him responsible for the massacre. Francesco Gabrieli commented that \"we can only record the fact... that this God or at least this aspect of Him, is not ours\".\n\nParet and Watt say that the Banu Qurayza were killed not because of their faith but for \"treasonable activities against the Medinan community\". Watt relates that \"no important clan of Jews was left in Medina\" but he and Paret also note that Muhammad did not clear all Jews out of Medina.\n\nAiming at placing the events in their historical context, Watt points to the \"harsh political circumstances of that era\" and argues that the treatment of Qurayza was regular Arab practice (\"but on a larger scale than usual\"). Similar statements are made by Stillman, Paret, Lewis and Rodinson. On the other hand, Michael Lecker and Irving Zeitlin consider the events \"unprecedented in the Arab peninsula - a novelty\" and state that \"prior to Islam, the annihilation of an adversary was never an aim of war.\" Similar statements are made by Hirschberg and Baron.\n\nSome authors assert that the judgement of Sa'd ibn Mua'dh was conducted according to laws of Torah. Muhammad Hamidullah goes further and says that Sa'd \"applied to them their own Biblical law [...] and their own practice.\" No contemporaneous source says explicitly that Sa'd based his judgment on the Torah. Moreover, the respective verses of the Torah make no mention of treason or breach of faith, and the Jewish law as it existed at the time and as it is still understood today applies these Torah verses only to the situation of the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, and not to any other period of history.\n\nWalid N. Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed that the Banu Qurayza were killed on quite such a large scale. Arafat disputes large-scale killings and argued that Ibn Ishaq gathered information from descendants of the Qurayza Jews, who embellished or manufactured the details of the incident. Arafat relates the testimony of Ibn Hajar, who denounced this and other accounts as \"odd tales\" and quoted Malik ibn Anas, a contemporary of Ibn Ishaq, whom he rejected as a \"liar\", an \"impostor\" and for seeking out the Jewish descendants for gathering information about Muhammad's campaign with their forefathers. Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved. Watt finds Arafat's arguments \"not entirely convincing\", while Meir J. Kister has contradicted the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad.\n\nThe historicity of this event has been put into question by western scholars such as Hans Jansen, Fred Donner, Patricia Crone & Michael Cook.\n\nThe fate of the Banu Qurayza became the subject of Shaul Tchernichovsky's Hebrew poem \"Ha-aharon li-Venei Kuraita\" (\"The Last of the Banu Qurayza\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was so successful that it spawned a 2006 miniseries and a feature film entitled \"Hero: The Movie\" which reached #3 on the 2007 top-grossing film chart in Japan.\n\nStarting July 2014, Fuji TV aired a second series entitled Hero 2, which had Takuya Kimura reprising his role.\n\nKuryu Kohei is a young public prosecutor who gets transferred to a division in Tokyo from Aomori. Kuryu is unlike a typical prosecutor; he refuses to wear a suit and tie, opting for casual clothing, his trademark orange down jacket and stylish boots. He looks and behaves more like a Generation X slacker. He is known for always buying bizarre items from infomercials and the home shopping network. Kuryu is a high-school dropout who was falsely accused of a felony, cleared only by a public prosecutor who took the time to uncover the facts. This forces Kuryu to abandon his delinquent lifestyle, take his high school equivalency, study for the bar exam and pass with flying colours. Also, when he was 17 yrs old, he was arrested whilst trying to protect a friend. [ Hero season 1, ep 10.]\n\nKuryu's brilliant investigative instincts and determination make him well-suited as an investigator and advocate. Kuryu's job is to interview suspects and decide whether to proceed with pressing charges against them. However, unlike his colleagues, rather than sit behind a desk and rubber stamping suspects for trial, Kuryu will leave the office and (literally) do the legwork, go the extra mile and doggedly pursue the truth. However, his unorthodox approach generally generates a lot of antagonism and negative publicity.\n\nKuryu's colleagues are all concerned with status and position and do not think highly of Kuryu or his eccentricities. Amamiya Maiko, his paralegal assistant, is concerned with attaining her law credentials and becoming a full prosecutor. At first, she believes Kuryu's addition may help her chances but at the beginning of the series comes to detest Kuryu. Kuryu doesn't care too much with how he is viewed and only cares about uncovering the truth of criminal allegations.\n\nThroughout the series, Kuryu uncovers coerced confessions, unethical legal practices, corruption, obstruction from overzealous cops, sensationalistic media, interference from politicians and well connected, powerful elites. Over the course of the series, his idealism and dogged pursuit for truth and justice ignite a similar passion in his colleagues, especially Amamiya.\n\nBy the end of the series, Kuryu is transferred to Ishigaki Island because of all the commotion he causes.\n\nA running gag of the series was the bar tender who miraculously and instantly produced anything a person asked for, even if it was something rare, obscure or unlikely to be expected at a Japanese bar. The bar tender would never say a word except \"Aru yo.\" (meaning \"I got it\"). He would even produce the obscure items that Kuryu couldn't get from the infomercial channel. The character even appears as a sushi chef in the rural village of the 2006 special. Kuryu asks the chef if he is the same person, twin brother or close relative of the Tokyo bar tender, but the chef characteristically says nothing, only \"Aru yo\" when asked for items.\n\nThe popularity of the 2001 series spawned a two-hour special in 2006. In the special, 5 years has passed since the events of the TV series. Kuryu has been transferred from Ishigaki to Sapporo and finally ends up assigned to a small coastal village in rural Yamaguchi Prefecture. There, he inspires a new group of small town prosecutors and paralegals while investigating a murder possibly implicating a favorite local politician. The events of this special lead into the 2007 feature film.\n\nThis series takes place 7 years after the events of the feature film. Kuryu returns to the same Tokyo office from the first series and feature film. Also reprising their roles will be Kadano Takuzo, Kohinata Fumio, Yashima Norito and Tanaka Yoji. Bokuzo Masana, who had a nonspeaking role as the security guard in the first series (and feature film), is promoted to a series regular. His character is now a paralegal. New cast members will be Sugimoto Tetta, Hamada Gaku, Matsushige Yutaka, and Yoshida Yo, as well as Kitagawa Keiko, who will be Kuryu's new assistant paralegal.\n\nKatsumura Masanobu makes a cameo appearance in the first and tenth episode, while Otsuka Nene guest stars in the 4th episode. Kuryu's love interest from the first series and film, Amamiya (played by Matsu Takako), does not appear though she is mentioned a few times. When asked about Amamiya's whereabouts or his current relationship with her, Kuryu refuses to answer except to say \"not everything works out\"\n\nKuryu and the cast of characters from the second TV series appeared in a 2015 feature film (not to be confused with the 2015 Bollywood film of the same name), featuring the return of Amamiya.\n\nIt reached the third highest-grossing position in the 2015 Japanese box office.\n\nNaoko Iijima, Ryō (りょう), Yōji Tanaka\n\nYōji Tanaka, Naotarō Moriyama (ep.1), Shōsuke Tanihara (ep.2)\n\n\nIn the tables below, the blue numbers represent the lowest ratings and the red numbers represent the highest ratings.\n\n"}
