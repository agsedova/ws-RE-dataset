It was opened on Monday 9 June 1856. It was the responsibility of the Toxteth Park Burial Board, which had been established by at least 1855.\n\nThe opening ceremony was performed by the then Lord Bishop of Chester, and the first interment took place, that of an Elizabeth Watling on 17 June 1856.\n\nThe cemetery was built with consecrated and unconsecrated areas, and the layout, featuring walks, was by a \"Mr Gay of Bradford cemetery\".\n\nIt was taken over by Liverpool Corporation on 1 January 1905.\n\nThe cemetery's records are held on microfilm in the Liverpool Record Office, and provide the Burial Registers and the Order Books.\n\nThe cemetery is itself Grade II listed and incorporates a derelict chapel, a derelict mason's yard and a pair of lodges or gatehouses at the Smithdown Road entrance. A significant number of obelisk and Celtic cross gravestones are also listed. The cemetery also contains Toxteth War Memorial.\n\nTo the rear, the cemetery bounds the back gardens of houses on Arundel Avenue, and can be accessed through turnstiles in an ornate gateway set back from that road at the end of a short lane. On the easterly lodge at the main entrance at Smithdown Road there is a sign with provision for the insertion of digits indicating the time of evening at which these rear entrance turnstiles will be closed, but for some time this sign has been disused, as this lodge also appears to be (the westerly lodge being inhabited and, as of spring 2009, up for auction.)\n\nGrade II listed memorials include those of Sir John Bent, Eleanora and Willam Gillespie , Hetherington family , Dr James Sheridan Muspratt , Thomas Pennington , Robert Rodgers, Agnes and John Rowe and Patience Simpson \n\nThe cemetery contains the war graves of 274 Commonwealth service personnel, 227 from World War I and 45 from World War II. The largest group are in a War Graves plot containing 69 graves, the names of those in the plot being listed on a Screen Wall curb memorial, while other graves are dispersed throughout the cemetery. Fifty of the British dead are soldiers of the King's Liverpool Regiment.\n\nBuried in the cemetery (Grave G493) is John Hulley, founder of the Liverpool Gymansium and the National Olympian Association, who died in 1873. Revival of interest in his role in Olympic history was initiated by an article (2001) in the Journal of Olympic History entitled \"The Mystery of John Hulley\". Subsequently, his grave was rediscovered in 2008; it was badly damaged in that the headstone had been removed from the main covering stones and the grave was in a very bad condition from 130 years of atmospheric pollution.\n\nA Memorial Fund was set up to raise money for the restoration of Hulley's grave and increase awareness of his part in the founding of the British Olympic movement. This took several months but thanks to generous donations from the International Olympic Committee, the British Olympic Association, and members of the public, sufficient funds were raised to engage a stonemason.\n\nMessrs Welsbys of Liverpool renovated the grave and brought it back to its original condition and a re-dedication ceremony was held in 2009.\n\nAt the eastern end of the high southern boundary wall, where the cemetery ends and the grounds of a supermarket, a medical clinic, and modern houses begin, the high wall continues but the style of brickwork can be seen to change; this area now occupied by the aforementioned modern buildings was previously the Toxteth Park Workhouse, which was built in 1859 by the Toxteth Park Board of Guardians as part of the West Derby Union. In 1923 the workhouse changed its name to the Smithdown Road Institution; in 1930 the Poor Law was abolished and the Union was disbanded, so the hospital was taken over by Liverpool Corporation. In 1933, its name was changed to Smithdown Road Infirmary, and in about 1950 its name was changed again, to Sefton General Hospital. Most of it was demolished in 2001 but a part of the original workhouse hospital, Arundel House, still stands.\n\n\n"}

The results of this pilot study indicated that the children involved made good progress, and consequently state finance supported the formation of Division TEACCH.\n\nFounded in 1971 by Eric Schopler at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, TEACCH provides training and services geared to helping autistic children and their families cope with the condition. Gary B. Mesibov, a professor and researcher on UNC's TEACCH program since about 1979, was director of the program from 1992 to 2010.\n\nWith over 40 years of experience of working with autistic people, TEACCH methodology continues to evolve, refining its approach. It is a \"pioneering\" program for assisting with autism spectrum disorder education, research and service delivery for children and adults.\n\nThe TEACCH philosophy recognises autism as a lifelong condition and does not aim to cure but to respond to autism as a culture. Core tenets of the TEACCH philosophy include an understanding of the effects of autism on individuals; use of assessment to assist program design around individual strengths, skills, interests and needs; enabling the individual to be as independent as possible; working in collaboration with parents and families.\n\nThe emphasis on individualization means that TEACCH does not distinguish between people with very high skill levels and those with learning disabilities. Strategies used are designed to address the difficulties faced by all people with autism, and be adaptable to whatever style and degree of support is required. TEACCH methodology is rooted in behavior therapy, more recently combining cognitive elements, guided by theories suggesting that behavior typical of people with autism results from underlying problems in perception and understanding. The strategies put forward by TEACCH do not work on the behavior directly, but on its underlying reasons, such as lack of understanding of what the person is expected to do or what will happen to them next, and sensory under- or over-stimulation. By addressing communication deficits, the person will be supported to express their needs and feelings by means other than challenging behavior.\n\nWorking from the premise that people with autism are predominantly visual learners, intervention strategies are based around physical and visual structure, schedules, work systems and task organization. Individualized systems aim to address difficulties with communication, organisation, generalisation, concepts, sensory processing, change and relating to others. Whereas some interventions focus on addressing areas of weakness, the TEACCH approach works with existing strengths and emerging skill areas.\n\nMost of the literature is of North American origin. The adoption of the TEACCH approach has been slower elsewhere. In 1993, Jones et al. stated that there was insufficient use of the TEACCH approach in the UK to include it in their study of interventions. In 2003 it was reported that Gary B. Mesibov and Eric Schopler describe TEACCH as the United Kingdom's most common intervention used with children with autism. In Europe and the United States it is also a common intervention.\n\nTEACCH runs conferences in North Carolina and organizes programs throughout the US and in the UK.\n\nTEACCH has been running for several decades and a range of studies indicates that it is an effective intervention for autism, although the studies did not meet all the criteria to qualify TEACCH unreservedly as evidence based practice.\n\nConcerns have been raised about the influence on intervention outcomes from staff member skills and experience.\n\nApart from two outcome studies most findings relate to the use of TEACCH with people with additional learning disability, and the focus of most studies is with children.\n\nThe TEACCH structured teaching approach can be regarded as combining a range of prosthetic devices to support the individual with autism to manage their life as independently as possible. Schopler et al. identified studies of differing methods of using structured teaching in non-TEACCH educational programmes with children with a range of diagnoses. All of these studies are reported as supporting the efficacy of structured teaching.\n\nSchopler, Brehm, Kinsbourne and Reichler compared four children with autism in structured and unstructured teaching situations. They found that two of the children learned more in structured situations, these being those children at earlier developmental stages. These results are supported by a larger comparative study in a range of three settings with varying levels of structure. However the presence of a higher initial mean IQ level (66) in the structured group compared to the comparison groups (48 and 52) may have been influential.\n\nSchopler et al. examined parent reports of the effectiveness of structured teaching within the TEACCH program. Questionnaires from 348 families completed between 1966 and 1977 were analyzed. 96% of the families with older children reported that their children were still living in the local community. This compared to between 26% and 61% of adolescents with autism in contemporaneous follow-up studies in other settings.\n\nIn a study comparing the behavior of children with autism in the period between referral to a psychiatrist and diagnosis with their behavior during a similar time period after structured teaching had been implemented by parents, Short reported a significant reduction in inappropriate behaviors.\n\nOzonoff and Cathcart studied two groups of 11 children matched by diagnosis, age and severity of autism. One group provided a control, receiving only a discrete trial school-based program, while the experimental group received an additional home-based TEACCH program for 4 months. Pre- and post-testing using PEP-R identified that the experimental group made an overall improvement 3 to 4 times greater than the control group in motor skills, imitation and non-verbal conceptual skills.\n\nA criticism of the evidence base for TEACCH is the lack of independent studies. However, a number of studies, notably from Europe and Japan do exist. Notomi reports on five case studies using TEACCH interventions in Japan. In each case, the behavior (repeated emptying of a toy box, stripping in class, encopresis, throwing clothing from a high-rise balcony, flooding irrigation systems) was reported as being successfully extinguished. However, these were not controlled trials and no standard objective assessment tool was used.\n\nKielinen et al. found that 43.9% of 187 children with autism between 3 and 18 years old in their study in northern Finland were receiving TEACCH. Though some improvement was reported, results were not significantly higher than for any other intervention identified in the study, and were further compromised by the fact that 82.9% of those in the study were receiving more than one intervention. Similarly Sheehy’s finding of substantial improvements in a range of motor, perception and cognition skills in the Barnardo’s preschool program in Northern Ireland acknowledges that other strategies were in evidence, compromising the integrity of TEACCH implementation. A reported study from France is also compromised by lack of treatment integrity, using TEACCH approaches in a broader package of intervention.\n\nSines evaluated classrooms against the Division TEACCH classroom checklist to support intervention integrity. His study involved a convenience sample of 19 children from TEACCH classrooms in four special schools in Northern Ireland. A single pupil from a non-TEACCH classroom was included in the study as a control. In addition, six adults with autism and one with a non-specific communication disability were identified by a day service using TEACCH. All parents of the children and adults were interviewed, and 53 professional support staff involved with the participants were sent questionnaires; 28 of these being returned. In measuring the effectiveness of TEACCH, 79% of respondents described TEACCH as effectively reducing inappropriate behaviour. Additionally, other areas of improvement were noted by 86% in self-help skills, 73% in social skills, 82% in fine motor skills, 60% in gross motor skills and 90% in communication skills.\n\nFindings supporting the effectiveness of TEACCH programs were confirmed in a later study comparing a TEACCH programme to a normal Italian school programme (not autism specific) in an evaluative study by Panerai, Ferrante and Zingale. Sixteen participants were allocated to two groups matched by age, gender, IQ and diagnosis. The PEP-R and Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) were administered at baseline and after a one-year interval. The PEP-R scores of the experimental (TEACCH) group showed a statistically significant increase in all categories except fine motor skills. The control group scores showed an increase in hand-eye coordination only. The VABS results showed statistically significant improvement in total daily living skills for both groups, but only in the experimental group for the overall total. There was no significant change in challenging behavior for either group, though a previous study evaluating the use of TEACCH with 18 children and adolescents with autism reported a notable reduction in challenging behaviors during structured activities compared to during non-structured activities. Although this study did not use a control group, the researchers found overall improvements in behavior and communication after 12 months and 18 months of a TEACCH program.\n\nAlongside the treatment integrity issues highlighted in some independent studies (e.g.), therapist drift may also impact on outcome validity. Outside of the controlled environment of Division TEACCH services, a model for supporting the integrity of strategies from the training room to practice has been proposed by Chatwin and Rattley.\n\nJordan describes the literature on TEACCH as providing ‘very positive, but not remarkable, results’. Though there are studies involving control groups (e.g.), thorough scientific validation of the TEACCH approach is scarce. However, there has been no objective study finding it to be ineffective, harmful nor leading to unintended consequences.\n\nFrom published reviews of interventions for people with autism a consensus of effective features can be identified. These include parental involvement, early intervention, developing communication skills, joint attention and social understanding; and using the individual’s strengths and interests. In these terms the TEACCH methodology uses appropriate techniques to address appropriate issues.\n\nA recent meta-analysis compiling all the clinical trials of TEACCH indicated that it has small or no effects on perceptual, motor, verbal, cognitive, and motor functioning, communication skills, and activities of daily living. There were positive effects in social and maladaptive behavior, but these required further replication due to the methodological limitations of the pool of studies analysed. These findings, published in one of the most prestigious and rigorous clinical psychology journals, raise questions about the conclusions of reviews that do not use standard methods for compiling scientific evidence.\n\n\n"}

They are now classified as one of several Murri language groups in Queensland.\n\nTheir language was Gabi-Gabi, consisting of a number of closely related dialects belonging to the Waka-Kabic branch of the Pama-Nyungan languages. 'Gubbi/Gabi' is their word for 'no'. The Australian English word \"coolabah\", denoting a type of Eucalyptus, was borrowed from Gabi-Gabi.\n\nOne variety of the language was first described by the Reverend William Ridley on the basis of notes taken from an interview with James Davis in 1855. Davis lived among the \"Ginginbara\" clan and called it Dippil.\n\nAccording to Norman Tindale the Gubbi Gubbi people were an inland group living in the Wide Bay–Burnett area, and their lands extended over and lay west of Maryborough. The northern borders ran as far as Childers and Hervey Bay. On the south, they approached the headwaters of the Mary River and Cooroy. Westwards, they reached as far as the Coast Ranges and Kilkivan. Gubbi Gubbi country is currently located between Pumicestone Road, near Caboolture in the south, through to Childers in the north. Their country was originally rain forest, with cleared areas created by regular firing of the scrub.\n\nContemporary Gubbi Gubbi people, through their representative Dyungungoo corporation, have mapped the landscape covered by their native heritage, as part of the process of claiming native title.\n\nThe Gubbi Gubbi were divided into several clans or \"bora\":\n\nSome Gubbi Gubbi died in the mass poisoning of upwards of 60 Aborigines on the Kilcoy run in 1842. A further 50-60 are said to have been killed by food laced with arsenic at Whiteside Station in April 1847. As colonial entrepreneurs pushed into their territory to establish pastoral stations, they together with the Butchulla set up a fierce resistance: from 1847 to 1853, 28 squatters and their shepherds were killed. In June 1849 two youths, the Pegg brothers, were speared on the property while herding sheep. Gregory Blaxland, the 7th son of the eponymous explorer Gregory Blaxland took vengeance, heading a vigilante posse of some 50 squatters and station hands and, at Bingera, ambushed a group of 100 sleeping myalls of the \"Gin gin tribe\" who are usually identified now as the Gubbi Gubbi. They had feasted on stolen sheep. Marksmen picked off many, even those fleeing by diving into the Burnett River. The slaughter was extensive, and the bones of many of the dead were uncovered on the site many decades later. Blaxland was in turn killed in a payback action sometime in July–August 1850. His death was revenged in a further large-scaled massacre of tribes in the area.\n\nThe escaped convict James Davis, in addition to dwelling with several other tribes, is said to have lived for a time with the Gubbi Gubbi. John Mathew, a clergyman turned anthropologist, also spent 5 years with them at Manumbar and mastered their language. He described their society in a 1910 monograph, \"Two Representative Tribes of Queensland\". The Gubbi Gubbi people he grew up with numbered no more than a score by the early 1880s.\n\nThe Gubbi Gubbi people were one of the hosts for the great bunya nut festivals every three years, which attracted many people from distant areas to the area of the Blackall Range.\n\nThe Queensland lungfish was native to Gubbi Gubbi waters and the species fell under a taboo among them, forbidding its consumption.

Flores (born September 21, 1975), best known by his stage name Lil Rob, is a Mexican-American rapper, producer, and actor.\n\nFlores was born in San Diego, and raised in La Colonia de Eden Gardens, a Mexican-founded neighborhood in Solana Beach, California.\n\nIn the early 1990s, he began performing under the name Lil Rob & the Brown Crowd, and recorded a single titled \"Oh, What a Night in the 619\". Though it did not chart, it was later featured on his 1997 debut album \"Crazy Life\", \nwith the title shortened to \"Oh, What a Night\". In 1994, his chin was shattered when he was shot in the jaw and in the eye later.\nDuring his career, Lil Rob has collaborated with fellow Chicano rappers Mr. Shadow, Mr. Sancho, and OG Spanish Fly, and mainstream artists such as Paul Wall, The Game, E-40 and Pitbull. Lil Rob and Mr. Shadow were in a group called The Mayhem Click. The numbers twelve and eighteen, which are tattooed on his forearms, represent the numeric value of the letters L and R, the initials of his stage name. The number was used during his days as a graffiti tagger.\n\nIn 2002, Lil Rob left Low Profile Records and signed to Upstairs Records. He found commercial success with the 2005 release \"Twelve Eighteen (Part I)\" in which the single \"Summer Nights\" received national airplay, a first in his career. \"Summer Nights\" peaked at #36 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #13 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The follow-up single, \"Bring Out the Freak in You\", peaked at #85 on the Hot 100 Charts, and at #20 on the Hot Rap Tracks. The exposure led to small roles in the 2005 Cuba Gooding, Jr. film \"Dirty\" and the 2007 Rob Schneider vehicle \"Big Stan\", both of which were released straight to DVD in the U.S.\n\nOn June 29, 2007, Lil Rob made his very first appearance overseas in Okinawa, Japan. \"1218 (Part II)\" was released in 2008 and featured the single \"Let Me Come Back\" featuring Fingazz. In 2009, \"Love & Hate\", was released, and in 2013, he released a new song called \"Don't Want to Fall in Love\".\n\nIn 2014, his ninth album, \"R.I.P. (Recording In Progress)\", was released.\n\nLil Rob was in conflict with Mr. Shadow, Royal T (CEO of Low Profile Records), and Mister D (CEO of Southland Records). Mr. Shadow would malign Lil Rob on hit singles, \"Shadow of Your Death\", \"Excited\" and \"Excited 2\". These songs were from the album \"Till I Die\". One of the reasons why Mr. Shadow had problems with Lil Rob was because Mr. Shadow claimed that Lil Rob was not from San Diego. Mr. Shadow claimed that he was from Solana Beach. Mr. Shadow felt that Lil Rob was lying to everyone about being raised in San Diego, CA. In 2005, on the \"Twelve Eighteen (Part I)\" album, Lil Rob also disses his own cousin in the song \"I Who Have Nothing\".\n\nLil Rob feuded with Royal T, and eventually left his label, on account of marketing issues. Royal T, the executive producer of Low Profile Records, had created a scam that involved Lil Rob's albums to have the same bar code as Royal T's CDs, which resulted in Royal T automatically receiving the profits. According to Lil Rob's manager, Lil Rob sold over $1 million worth of his own CDs and didn't receive a dime. As soon as Lil Rob left Low Profile, Lil Rob recorded a diss aimed towards Low Profile, entitled \"The Last Laff\" on \"The Last Laff EP\". Low Profile Records responded with a track entitled \"Riders\", featuring Royal T, Payaso (Dukes Click), Lil' Bandit & Mr. Sancho. Lil Rob recorded another diss track entitled \"Call the Cops\", directed at Royal T on 2002's \"The Album\". Lil Rob also recorded diss tracks \"Bluffin'\", dissing directly at Royal T and \"Boo Hoo Hoo\" dissing both Royal T and Mr. Shadow off of 2004's \"Neighborhood Music\".\n\nLil Rob has collaborated with musicians such as Mr. Shadow, Lil Cuete, Royal T, Mr. Lil One, Mr. Sancho, OG Spanish Fly, Silencer, Fingazz, Kid Frost, Frankie J, J. Cole, Ludacris, Pitbull, N.O.R.E, Chingo Bling, Bizzy Bone, Far East Movement, Baby Bash, The Game, Eric Bellinger, Ice Cube, WC, Dyablo, NB Ridaz, SPM, Fat Joe, Paul Wall, Flo Rida, Voltio and C-Kan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276673", "title": "Dotawo", "text": "Dotawo\n\nDotawo (Old Nubian: \"Lower Dau\" or \"Daw\") was a kingdom that might have existed in the Beja Region of Lower Nubia (Northern Sudan and Southern Egypt) in the Middle Ages. It has long been known that a kingdom by this name is mentioned as existing during the collapse of the Kingdom of Makuria in the thirteenth century. It was reported to be one of the last surviving Christian states in the region.\n\nScholars believed it was one of a number of small successor states to emerge during this anarchic period. However, the large collection of documents found at Qasr Ibrim in the 1960s overturned this view. The Qasr Ibrim find contains many documents relating to relations between the Eparch of Nobatia and the King of Dotawo. These include relations during Makuria's peak in the 12th century. The Eparch even seems to have had far more dealings with the king of Dotawo than his overlord the king of Makuria.\n\nOne explanation for this is that Dotawo is simply another name for Makuria. The depiction of multiple kings clashes with the description of the region given by Arab traveler Ibn Selim el-Aswani. In no known document are the names of both Dotawo and Makuria present, and at several points the listed names of the king of Dotawo matches those of Makuria.\n\nHowever at many other points in time the name of the King of Dotawo being written to does not match that of the King of Makuria. The name also seems to indicate a Kingdom based at Gebel Adda, also known as Daw. One Arab writer reports that the Beja region was structured with thirteen lesser kings under one \"Great King,\" and Dotawo could have been one of these vassal kingdoms.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2276680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276680", "title": "WFMJ-TV", "text": "WFMJ-TV\n\nWFMJ-TV, virtual channel 21 (UHF digital channel 33), is a dual NBC/CW-affiliated television station licensed to Youngstown, Ohio, United States. The station is owned by the Maag family of Youngstown, with studios on West Boardman Street in downtown Youngstown. The transmitter is based in the city's Lansingville neighborhood.\n\nFrom its inception until 2019, the station was owned by the Vindicator Printing Company, former publisher of Youngstown's lone newspaper, \"The Vindicator.\" On September 1, 2019; the Maags sold \"The Vindicator\" to Ogden Newspapers, which now operates it as an edition of the \"Tribune Chronicle\" in Warren. The Maags retained WFMJ-TV.\n\nThe station was founded by William F. Maag, Jr., publisher of the \"Vindicator\", and went on the air for the first time on March 11, 1953 on channel 73. The station was owned alongside WFMJ radio (1390 AM, now WNIO, and 105.1 FM, now WQXK). WFMJ-TV has always been an NBC affiliate owing to its radio sister's long affiliation with NBC Red Network. The Maags then purchased the construction permit issued for channel 21 (originally granted to WUTV) and moved to that frequency on August 7, 1954. After moving channels, WFMJ was replaced on channel 73 by independent station WXTV, which moved to channel 45 in 1959 (the former channel location of WYTV, then WKST-TV, before moving to channel 33) and remained on-the-air until late 1962.\n\nFrom its sign-on until 1957, WFMJ-TV served as the NBC affiliate for the far northern portion of the Pittsburgh market, mainly areas not covered by WJAC-TV in Johnstown, Pennsylvania and WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia for NBC programming (the latter station is now affiliated with CBS). This ended when Pittsburgh got its own NBC affiliate, WIIC-TV (now WPXI), in September 1957. In addition to its main service area of extreme northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania, WFMJ-TV can be seen as far as the eastern and southern suburbs of Cleveland with a good antenna, which allowed access to NBC programming pre-empted by KYW-TV from 1956 until 1965, when Cleveland's channel 3 was owned by Westinghouse Broadcasting, before the sale was undone and it returned to NBC ownership as WKYC.\n\nWFMJ-TV has been the only locally owned and operated station in the market since CBS affiliate WKBN-TV (channel 27) was sold off in 1997. In fact, it is one of the few stations left in the country that is still locally owned and operated and one of four in Ohio, with the others being WBNX-TV in Akron, WCPO-TV in Cincinnati, and WHIZ-TV in Zanesville. Channel 21 points out often in advertisements noting that it is the \"only locally-owned station in Youngstown.\" As a result, WFMJ has been a ratings juggernaut in Youngstown for several years.\n\nWFMJ is one of the few stations in the country that airs \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Judge Judy\", and \"Dr. Phil\" on the same station. WFMJ's morning show (\"WFMJ Today\"), NBC's \"Today\", and \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\"s ratings are among the highest in the country. WFMJ is also the Youngstown market's carrier station for the Ohio Lottery and its weekly game show, \"Cash Explosion Double Play\". In October 2010, WFMJ began carrying syndicated programs, and commercials in high definition whenever available in the format. In April 2011, the station started broadcasting the Ohio Lottery's weekly game show \"Cash Explosion\" in HD.\n\nIn 2006, WFMJ opened a satellite studio at the Eastwood Mall in Niles, Ohio. Officially known as the Eastwood Mall Bureau, its primary focus is to cover news stories in Trumbull County, Ohio. It also features a retail store where people can buy WFMJ souvenirs, such as T-shirts embroidered with the WFMJ and/or WBCB logos.\n\nOn July 6, 2012, Dish Network subscribers within the Youngstown market temporarily lost access to WFMJ-TV, the result of a breakdown in negotiations between the satellite provider and owner Vindicator Printing Company to renew the station's carriage agreement with Dish.\n\nWFMJ-DT2, branded on-air as The CW WBCB, is the CW-affiliated second digital subchannel of WFMJ-TV, broadcasting in 1080i high definition on UHF channel 20.2 (or virtual channel 21.2 via PSIP). The subchannel can also be seen on all local cable and DBS systems including Comcast Xfinity, Charter Spectrum and DirecTV channel 14, and Armstrong Cable channel 16. It uses the unofficial call sign \"WBCB\" for identification and ratings purposes. Despite being part of The CW through a digital subchannel affiliation, WFMJ-DT2 is one of the few small-market CW affiliates carried via a digital multicast or local cable channel that is not part of The CW Plus; syndicated programming broadcast by the subchannel is instead supplied by WFMJ-TV.\n\nThe subchannel launched in November 2004 as an affiliate of The WB (branded on-air as The Valley's WB), and despite Youngstown's small market size (ranked #106 by Nielsen Media Research ), WBCB was one of the nation's first digital subchannels whose programming did not consist of 24-hour weather information (such as NBC Weather Plus). Around the time of launch, WFMJ chose to affiliate \"WBCB\" with The WB because the founders of Warner Bros. originally hailed from Youngstown; the market had also been underserved by the network as Cleveland's then-WB affiliate WBNX-TV (later also a CW affiliate, now an independent station) was only carried on cable in the northern fringes of the market (despite being one of that network's strongest affiliates without Youngstown) while Pittsburgh WB affiliate WCWB (itself now affiliated with MyNetworkTV) was not even available on cable at all in the market (by contrast, Cleveland's then-UPN affiliate WUAB (now also a CW affiliate) was and remains widely available on cable in Youngstown, while WNPA/Pittsburgh was available in certain sections of the market).\n\nMost of the market received WB network programming via \"WBWO\", a cable-only WB affiliate of The WB 100+ Station Group out of the Wheeling–Steubenville market, with systems owned and operated by Time Warner Cable (the largest cable provider in Youngstown) only receiving it during prime time hours, otherwise sharing channel space with MTV2. Comcast and Armstrong Cable both offered both MTV2 and WBWO 24 hours on their own channel space. The \"WBCB\" calls date back to the station's WB affiliation (affiliates of The WB 100+ Station Group commonly utilized fictional callsigns).\n\nOn January 24, 2006, UPN and The WB announced the two networks would cease broadcasting and merge to form The CW. \"WBCB\" would be chosen by default as the market's CW affiliate and for unknown reasons, the artificial call sign \"WBCB\" was kept after the subchannel affiliated with The CW in September 2006. With digital subchannels more common by this point, ABC affiliate WYTV launched a second digital subchannel affiliated with MyNetworkTV (under the branding \"MY-YTV\") that fall.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nSyndicated programming featured on WFMJ-TV includes \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", \"Inside Edition\", \"Judge Judy\" and \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\". WBCB includes programming such as \"TMZ on TV\" and \"Access Hollywood\".\n\nWFMJ's newscasts typically garner higher ratings than its competitors combined in the morning, 6 and 11 p.m. timeslots. The station founded the market's first Friday night high school football program with \"The Overtime Report\" in the 1990s. On October 29, 2009, beginning with the 6 p.m. newscast, the station upgraded its weather graphics to Weather Central's 3D:LIVE system. On October 26, 2013, WFMJ launched the area's first weekend morning news with \"WFMJ Weekend Today\". The newscasts air on Saturdays from 6:00–7:00 and 9:00–10:00 a.m. and on Sundays from 7:00–8:00 and 9:00–10:30 a.m.\n\n"}

His most influential publication was his two-volume book \"Chemistry, Theoretical, Practical and Analytical as applied and relating to the Arts and Manufactures\" (1857–1860).\n\nJames Sheridan Muspratt was born in Dublin and moved to Liverpool with his parents when he was one year old. His father, James Muspratt, was one of the biggest industrial chemicals manufacturers in the UK between 1825 and 1850. James Sheridan Muspratt attended private schools in Bootle, Merseyside, and then went with tutors to travel on the European continent. Beginning in 1836, he studied chemistry under Thomas Graham at Anderson's University in Glasgow and then moved with Graham to University College London.\n\nIn 1841, his father sent him to Philadelphia to manage the Muspratt business interests there but these were unsuccessful. \nMuspratt's father had met and become friends with Justus von Liebig at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and James Sheridan was sent to work with von Liebig at the University of Giessen in Germany where he gained a PhD in 1845.\n\nJames Sheridan Muspratt's own cited original research work includes a report on the sulphites (1845) and, with August Wilhelm von Hofmann, on the preparation of toluidine and nitraniline (1845–1846).\n\nIn 1848, Muspratt founded the Liverpool College of Chemistry in a disused stable at the back of his house in Canning Street, Liverpool. \nUpon his father's retirement in 1857, he became a partner along with his brothers in his father's chemicals manufacturing business. \nBut it was also in the late 1850s that he wrote the textbook \"Chemistry, Theoretical, Practical and Analytical as applied and relating to the Arts and Manufactures\". The German translation of this book by Friedrich Stohmann was widely read in Germany, which was the leading nation in the field at the time. Muspratt also published translation into English of some German-language chemistry.\n\nMuspratt took an interest in theatre and helped to organise a visit to Liverpool of Charles Dickens's amateur company in 1847. Among the cast were the American actress Susan Webb Cushman. Muspratt married Susan in 1848 and they had three daughters. Susan died in 1859 and Muspratt remarried, to Ann Neal of Rainhill the following year. They had no children and Muspratt died at his home in West Derby, Liverpool in 1871.\n\n"}

He was known for bringing large numbers of journalists into the profession. \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1995, \"Few journalists have left a more enduring imprint on late 20th-century journalism—an imprint that was unabashedly mimicked even as it was being mocked—than Clay Felker.\"\n\nHe was born in 1925 in Webster Groves, Missouri, the son of Carl Felker, an editor of \"The Sporting News\", and his wife, the former Cora Tyree, the former women's editor of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\". Both of Clay's parents along with a grandfather and a grandmother graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism. He had one sibling, Charlotte. Felker's grandfather, Henry Clay Felker, of German aristocratic origins, fled Germany after the 1848 Conservative takeover. The family surname was originally von Fredrikstein.\n\nFelker attended Duke University, where he first became interested in journalism and edited the student newspaper, \"The Duke Chronicle\". He left school in 1943 to join the Navy, but returned to the school to graduate in 1951. In 1983, he founded the Editorial Board for the alumni publication \"Duke Magazine\". Duke awarded Felker an honorary degree in 1998, as well as the Futrell Award for Excellence in Communications and Journalism. \"Duke Magazine\" created the staff position of Clay Felker Fellow for \"an aspiring journalist with unusual promise.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Felker worked as a sportswriter for \"Life Magazine\". He turned an article he wrote about Casey Stengel into a 1961 book, \"Casey Stengel's Secret\". He was on the development team for \"Sports Illustrated\" and was features editor for \"Esquire\". He later worked for \"TIME\".\n\nFelker gave Gloria Steinem what she later called her first \"serious assignment,\" regarding contraception; he didn't like her first draft and had her re-write the article. Her resulting 1962 article about the way in which women are forced to choose between a career and marriage preceded Betty Friedan's book \"The Feminine Mystique\" by one year. She joined the founding staff of Felker's \"New York\" and became politically active in the feminist movement. Felker funded the first issue of \"Ms. Magazine\".\n\nAfter losing a battle for \"Esquire\" editorship to Harold Hayes, Felker left to join \"The New York Herald Tribune\" in 1962. He revamped a Sunday section into \"New York\" and hired writers such as Tom Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin; the section became the \"hottest Sunday read in town.\"\n\nA long-time friend of Tom Wolfe, Felker was one of the early proponents of New Journalism and key to its emergence. \"The New York Herald Tribune\" closed its doors in 1966 and Felker later, in 1968, reconstituted the Sunday section as \"New York Magazine\". After founding \"New York Magazine\" in 1968, one of his first features was Wolfe's coverage of Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, a story Wolfe later expanded into his non-fiction novel \"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test\". \"New York\" became one of the most imitated magazines of its time, both from a design perspective and in the way it combined service and life-style articles. \"He had the crass but revolutionary (revolutionary in the sense that it overthrew generations of class conceits) notion that you are what you buy. He sniffed the great consumer revolution with its social, political, and aesthetic implications. And \"New York Magazine\" became the first magazine to spell out where to get the goods (and at the best price),\" wrote Michael Wolff about Felker in New York's 35th Anniversary issue.\n\nFelker became editor-in-chief and publisher of \"The Village Voice\" in 1974 and resigned from \"New York\" following its hostile takeover by Rupert Murdoch in 1976. He then bought \"Esquire\" in 1977 but sold it in 1979. Felker also, in 1988, bought the lower Manhattan paper \"Downtown Express\", but sold it in 1991. In 1987 he became editor of the business magazine \"Manhattan, inc.\", staying on as editor when it was sold and merged with the lifestyle magazine \"M\" into \"M, inc.\" \"Spy\" magazine portrayed Felker as out of touch with his former milieu and in charge of a series of money-losing journalistic enterprises.\n\nIn 1994, Felker became a lecturer at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, teaching a course called \"How to Make a Magazine\" at the Felker Magazine Center, named in his honor and of which he became director. Felker's stylish but detached role as the founder and editor of \"New York\" magazine led some observers to compare him with another American mid-Westerner who went east—albeit a fictional one, Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby.\n\nFelker was married three times:\n\nHe died on July 1, 2008 in Manhattan from what his wife, Gail Sheehy, described as \"natural causes\", following a long battle with throat cancer.\n\nTom Wolfe said: “He ranks with Henry Luce of \"Time\", Harold Ross of the \"New Yorker\" and Jann Wenner of \"Rolling Stone\" in that these are all people that brought out magazines that had a new take on life in America.” \n\nThe current editor-in-chief of \"New York\", Adam Moss, wrote after Felker's death: “American journalism would not be what it is today without Clay Felker. He created a kind of magazine that had never been seen before, told a kind of story that had never been told.\"\n\n\n"}

The stadium is primarily used for baseball and is the home field of the Auburn Doubledays minor league baseball team. The Auburn Maroons high school baseball team also plays its home games at the stadium.\n\nThe current, rebuilt facility opened in 1995 and holds 2,800 people. As of 2004, the venue's full name is Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park.\n\nFalcon Park was originally built in 1927 on the same site which currently houses the 1995 reconstructed facility. The stadium is called Falcon Park because it was built by a fraternal organization in Auburn called the Polish Falcons. The Polish Falcons owned the stadium until 1959, when the local minor league franchise purchased it. The City of Auburn purchased both the stadium and the franchise in 1981 by assuming the former team's unpaid debts.\n\nFalcon Park was a typical old wooden grandstand-type facility from 1927 until 1995. The original park's demolition began seconds after the final out of the final game of the 1994 season, with a bulldozer crashing into the stadium by smashing through the center field fence. The scene was shown nationally on ESPN.\n\nPermanent lights were first erected at Falcon Park in 1940, although some temporary construction lights were put in place in order to accommodate some night baseball in 1938. Before the stability of the present Auburn Doubledays franchise, professional minor league baseball was somewhat of a \"come and go\" proposition in Auburn. When the city had no team in 1957, the stadium was used as an auto racing speedway for children. The kids raced go-kart-type vehicles called microds on a one-tenth mile oval built on the ball diamond's infield. The races drew large crowds and the enterprise was featured in an article in Life Magazine. When the city had no team in 1981, the stadium was used for rock and roll concerts.\n\nA few games were staged here in May and June 1969 by the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League while their home field MacArthur Stadium was being repaired after a fire.\n\nAll of Auburn Community Baseball's entries in the New York-Penn League have played their home games at Falcon Park. Auburn's NY-P League team has operated under the following names:\n\n\nNotable Major League Baseball players who played for Auburn in Falcon Park include:\nAt the end of the 2004 NY-P season, the playing field at Falcon Park was named Leo Pinckney Field in honor of Auburn resident Leo Pinckney, who was instrumental in securing Auburn's New York-Penn league franchise in 1958. Pinckney was a former president of Auburn Community Baseball and a former president of the New York–Penn League, whose Pinckney Division is also named in Pinckney's honor.\n\nAs a result, the full name of the facility is now Leo Pinckney Field at Falcon Park, although it is still mostly known by its original, shorter name.\n\n"}

Women's professional boxing was not legal in the Philippines (despite the fact that the island nation has a strong amateur women's boxing team). Ryan Wissow and the WIBA worked with the Games and Amusement Board (GAB), who oversee all professional sports in the Philippines, to change the laws in their books to allow women to box there professionally.\nThe WIBA is also responsible for sanctioning the very first title fight, male or female, to take place in Guyana and in Macao.\n\nThe WIBA rates all worthy professional female boxers, including champions of other sanctioning bodies.\nWIBA also encourages unification bouts with other major women's sanctioning bodies like the IWBF, IFBA, WIBF, and the WBC Female Title.\n\nWIBA's current and former champions include Laila Ali, Jacqui Frazier-Lyde, Ann Wolfe, Leatitia Robinson, Gina Guidi, Sumya Anani, Kara Ro, Chevelle Hallback, Maribel Zurita, Ria Ramnarine, Emiko Raika, Marcela Acuña, Ada Vélez, Anita Christensen, Melinda Cooper, Jenifer Alcorn, Jeannine Garside, Mary Jo Sanders, Duda Yankovich and Melissa Hernández, Sylvia Scharper.\n\n"}

The stadium is currently home to the Batavia Muckdogs - Class-A short season affiliate of the Miami Marlins; Genesee Community College Cougars - NJCAA; and high school teams including the Notre Dame of Batavia Fighting Irish and Batavia Blue Devils.\n\nThe grandstand and surrounding structure of Dwyer Stadium may be new but the field and area hold over 80 years of professional baseball history. Originally built in 1939 the stadium underwent three names and stood until 1995 when being replaced by the new stadium, keeping the previous name.\n\nState Street Park was built in 1939 and employed 17 local workers to construct. During the first season of play the stadium went unfinished and a snow fence had to be placed for each game to act as the outfield wall while chairs had to be borrowed from a local mortuary for seating. The works project continued through the first season but did not deter fans as 3,000, still a record for Batavia, attended the first game of professional baseball at State Street Park.\n\nDuring World War II the name was changed to MacArthur Stadium after General Douglas MacArthur in an act of patriotism.\n\nBefore the 1973 season the stadium found its final name, Dwyer Stadium, after Edward D. Dwyer, a long time team president that was instrumental in keeping the team in Batavia. The stadium was a wooden and covered grandstand that was famous in old time ballparks.\n\nIn 1995, it was officially announced Batavia would be getting a new $3 million stadium on the same location; the field would remain intact while the grandstand and seating would be torn down and replaced. Auburn and Batavia each got a stadium that was almost carbon copies of one another. The old Dwyer Stadium still has its place in the new stadium as the original Wall of Fame is still present behind the first base bleachers.\n\nDwyer Stadium is primarily used for baseball, though has also been home to area youth football as well throughout its history.

On May 17, 2010, she became the 21st person and the first woman to climb all of the fourteen eight-thousander peaks in the World. Her first 8,000 peak had been achieved 9 years earlier, on May 23, 2001, when she climbed to the summit of Mount Everest.\n\nPasaban was born in Tolosa, in the province of Gipuzkoa in the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain. She summited her ninth eight-thousander, Broad Peak, on July 12, 2007, together with the Austrian climber Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner. On May 1, 2008, Pasaban summited Dhaulagiri, as did Kaltenbrunner the same day again. Both downplayed the aspect of a race between them for the first woman to climb all 14 eight-thousanders.\nOn May 18, 2009, Pasaban climbed the Kangchenjunga with, among others, Juanito Oiarzabal and the Polish climber Kinga Baranowska. With that she exceeded Kaltenbrunner and Nives Meroi and she became the first woman to climb twelve eight-thousanders. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner equaled her two days later when summited Lhotse. Nives Meroi, an Italian climber, then tried to achieve the summit in the Kangchenjunga, but was forced to abandon the climb when her husband and fellow climber, Romano Benet, began suffering health problems during the ascent.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, she added Annapurna to her record, and proceeded directly thereafter to climb Shishapangma, where she completed her quest on May 17.\n\nOn April 27, 2010, it was announced that Pasaban might have lost out on becoming the first woman to climb all 14 8,000 meter peaks to Korean climber Oh Eun-sun. However, Pasaban and other experts disputed Oh's summit of Kangchenjunga. Following a conversation between Elizabeth Hawley and Pasaban, Hawley announced that Oh's summit would be marked as \"disputed\" in future editions of her Himalayan database. On May 3, Oh had an hour long discussion with Hawley in Kathmandu, in which she asked Oh about the details of her Kangchenjunga climb. \"Oh will be credited for her climb to Kangchenjunga but the ascent will be marked as disputed,\" Hawley later told the press. \"Her account was completely different from Pasaban's so I really don't know who is right,\" she added. Hawley reportedly said the Kangchenjunga entry will be switched back to \"successful\" if the Spanish team withdraws its allegations. Rejecting Pasaban's claims, Oh added, \"I believe that according to Pasaban, some Sherpas told her that I hadn't climbed Kangchenjunga. But no names of the Sherpas have been mentioned. Why?\"\nOn May 4, 2010 Pasaban mentioned the names of the seven Sherpas involved: \"Dawa Ongchu Sherpa, Pema Chiring Sherpa, Chheji Nurbu Sherpa, Dawa Sangge Sherpa, Ong Darchi Sherpa, Cuombi Sherpa and Phurdorchi Sherpa.\" She declined to give these names earlier as these Sherpas were still working for the Korean climber. Later Pasaban conceded that she was the second woman to climb the 14 highest peaks, but questioned whether the Korean climber had actually conquered them all.\n\nHowever, on August 29, 2010, it was announced that the South Korean Hiking Federation, after examining the proofs presented by Oh, had refused to acknowledge her Kangchenjunga ascent, accepting the sherpas' version according to which Oh was not able to complete the ascent due to bad weather conditions.\n\nOther women attempting to climb all 8,000 meter peaks include Nives Meroi of Italy, and Go Mi-young of Korea, who fell to her death from a cliff while descending Nanga Parbat after reaching the summit during dangerous weather conditions.\n\n\n"}

Diethrick, Jr. Park is a stadium in Jamestown, New York. It opened in 1941 and holds 3,000 people. Primarily used for baseball, Diethrick Park was home to teams in the New York–Penn League, a short season minor league baseball league, from its opening until 2014. It is also home to the Jamestown Community College baseball team as well as Jamestown High School's baseball team. It also has hosted multiple Babe Ruth League World Series, most recently the 2018 16-18 Year-Old World Series .\n\nBuilt in 1941, Jamestown Municipal Stadium was, at time of the NY-Penn League's departure, the second oldest ballpark in the league; the park replaced a park in Celoron that the NYPL had used in its first two seasons. The stadium is owned by the City of Jamestown. It hosted the Jamestown Falcons of the \"Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League \" (PONY League), which is now known as the NY-Penn League. The park was later unofficially known as \"College Stadium\" after Jamestown Community College relocated its campus right behind the park on Falconer Street in 1961.\n\nOn August 9, 1997, the park was renamed Russell E. Diethrick, Jr. Park in honor of Jamestown's \"Mr. Baseball.\" It was dedicated to Mr. Diethrick, who has been player, manager, owner, supporter and friend of professional and youth baseball in Jamestown longer than most can remember. Mr. Diethrick is currently the Community Development Officer for Jamestown Savings Bank. He has been an important member of the voluntary Jamestown Jammers Executive Advisory Board. Mr. Diethrick also serves as the Host President of the Jamestown Babe Ruth World Series Committee and a member of the National Board of Directors for Babe Ruth, Inc.\n\nThe stadium has undergone numerous renovations in order to modernize. In 2006, a brand new scoreboard and sound system were installed and in 2010 the current press box was renovated.\n\nThe Jamestown Jammers took up residence in the city in 1994, immediately after the Montreal Expos moved the city's original NYPL team to Vermont. After 21 consecutive seasons, the NYPL moved the Jammers to Morgantown, West Virginia at the end of the 2014 season, leaving the city without professional baseball.\n\nThe amateur Prospect League, a collegiate summer baseball league, took up residence in the ballpark in 2015; that team was also known as the Jamestown Jammers. The Jammers were replaced by a team in the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League the next year, which played another three seasons before the team's owners abruptly shut the team down and left town in October 2018. A replacement team in the PGCBL, originally intended to keep the Jammers name and history, abruptly decided to rename the team the Jamestown Tarp Skunks (after an inside joke in the Jammers organization) prior to the start of the 2020 season.\n\nIn 1990, College Stadium was the site of a memorable large-scale stunt by the TV series \"Candid Camera\", in which a catcher for the then-tenant Jamestown Expos was put up to calling pitches with nothing but incomprehensible signs.\n\nDiethrick Park is almost exclusively used for baseball; other venues in Jamestown are better suited for other sports (Strider Field hosts football, and Northwest Arena handles concerts, ice hockey and other indoor events).\n\n"}

Kayani or Justice Kayani, (18 October 1902 – 15 November 1962) was a distinguished Pakistani jurist who served as Chief Justice of West Pakistan from 1958 to 1962. He is noted for his opposition to the dictatorship of General Ayub Khan.\n\nHe hails from the village Shahpur located near Kohat, Pakistan. He was born on 18 October 1902 to an ethnic Pashtun family in the home of Khan Bahadur Abdul Samad Khan Kayani. He passed the matriculation examination from Islamia High School Kohat and did his F.A. from Edwards college Peshawar. He earned his master's degree in English from Government College Lahore.\n\nHe started his career in civil service in Punjab, British India in 1927, and after having served for eight years on the executive side, he was transferred to the judiciary in 1938. He rose to become a judge of the Punjab High Court in 1949 and then the chief justice of the West Pakistan High Court in 1958. In 1956, he was elected president of the West Pakistan Branch of the CSP Association. In that capacity he strove to uphold the status of the Civil service of Pakistan. He was also the member of the famous Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry.\n\nAs a judge and then chief justice, his speeches at various forums were widely covered by the national press because of the rare combination of intellect, wit, courage and integrity he personified. His characteristic brand of humour and caustic, witty remarks did not spare even presidents. The most popular speaker of the country in the last four years of his life, a collection of his speeches have appeared in the form of various books like \"The Whole Truth\", \"Not the Whole Truth\", \"Half Truth\", \"A Judge May Laugh\" and \"Afkar-e-Pareeshan\".\n\nKayani retired in October 1962. He was not elevated to the Supreme Court of Pakistan because of his open criticism of the military regime. The citizens of Lahore arranged a farewell reception in his honor in which he was named as Lisan-e-Pakistan (the voice of Pakistan). In his reply, Kayani said that this title was dearer to him than Nishan-e-Pakistan. Then he went on to say that his purpose in delivering such satirical speeches was to keep the morale of the people high in a period of gloom and darkness. He made the people laugh in order to release their tension.\n\nIn one of his more memorable comments he wrote:\n\nOne major Pakistani English newspaper comments about him, \"Mr. Kayani was gifted with a keen sense of humour. He was satirical without being sarcastic, humorous without being offensive. Frail, lean and thin, he was very gentle and genial in conversation, yet firm and unshakable in conviction.\"\n\nIn November 1962 he embarked upon a visit to East Pakistan where he was invited by the Bar Associations of Dhaka, Rajshahi and Chittagong. He died on 15 November 1962 in Chittagong Circuit House. His half-written speech was lying on the table beside his bed. The collections of his English and Urdu speeches entitled \"Not the Whole Truth\", \"Some More Truth\" and \"Afkar-e-Pareeshan\" appeared posthumously.\n\nOne of the six boarding hostels at the Cadet College, Kohat is named in his honour.\n"}

Formed in 1717 as Dragoner-Regiment Nr.5 \"Bayreuth Dragoner\" it was originally a dragoon regiment and was part of the Prussian order of battle until 1918. The \"Bayreuth Dragoons\" achieved fame for their role in winning the Battle of Hohenfriedberg in 1745. In 1819 it was transformed into a cuirassier regiment.\n\nApart from short interruptions, the regimental garrison was Pasewalk in Western Pomerania from 1721 to 1919.\n\nThe Prussian Dragoner-Regiment Nr. 5 was formed by a royal order on 2 April 1717. The new formation was to be sponsored by Oberst Achaz von der Schulenburg and raised from recruits in the Duchies of Ansbach and Bayreuth. by 1 June the regiment was formed, with 44 officers and NCOs and 295 cavalry troopers, all aged between 20 and 40 years old. By 1718, the regiment had expanded to four squadrons comprising 689 men.\n\nIt was not until 1730 that the regiment reached its full size, ten squadrons, a total of 62 officers, 120 NCOS, standard bearers, 30 drummers and 1,320 cavalry troopers. On 7 August 1731 the regiment was granted the honor title \"Bayreuth Dragoner\" (Bayreuth Dragoons) and was redesignated Dragoner-Regiment Nr. 5 \"Bayreuth Dragoner\".\n\nThe regiment wore the standard powder blue coat of the Prussian dragoons with crimson turnbacks and facings.\n\nThe regiment first saw action during the War of Austrian Succession. At the Battle of Mollwitz, six squadrons of the regiment were engaged on an attack on the Austrian's left wing. This attack caused the enemy to retreat and brought victory for the Prussian king, Frederick the Great.\n\nAt the Battle of Chotusitz, the regiment did not fare as well. During two cavalry attacks, the Bayreuth Dragoons failed to break through the enemy lines and suffered heavy losses including 14 officers, and three standards.\n\nThe regiment won its reputation at the Battle of Hohenfriedberg. The Austrian commander, Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, was holding against repeated Prussian infantry attacks. The commander of the Bayreuth Dragoons, Generalleutnant Gessler, saw an opportunity to attack a large force of Austrian infantry attacking the exhausted Prussian infantry. The ten squadrons of the regiment formed into two columns and charged into the Austrians. In the fighting that followed, the Bayreuth Dragoons destroyed 20 Austrian and Saxon battalions, took 2,500 prisoners, and captured 67 regimental standards, losing only 6 officers and 28 men killed. Prinz Karl was forced to retreat in disarray, and the battle was won.\n\nAfter the charge at Hohenfriedberg, the regiment was permitted to wear a golden \"67\" on their cartridge cases. They also received a \"diploma\" from Frederick the Great, naming all officers who took part in the charge and praising the regiment, as well as granting them their own regimental march, the \"Hohenfriedberger Marsch\", composed by Frederick himself.\n\nAlthough the regiment was present at the Battle of Soor, it did not see any action, arriving just before the Austrian defeat.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Seven Years' War in 1756, the regiment was in the vanguard of the Prussian advance into Saxony. At the Battle of Lobositz, the regiment was involved in the two failed cavalry charges against the Austrians on the Homolka-berg. The regiment performed as well as could be expected, with two squadrons rescuing the Gardes du Corps from annihilation.\n\nThe dragoons participated in the Siege of Pirna, and on 6 May 1757 took part in the bitterly fought Battle of Prague.\n\nIn the French Revolutionary Wars the regiment marched southwest in 1792 to fight in northern France in the Palatinate and Baden. In the battle of Jena-Auerstedt against Napoleon it was almost routed.\n\nIn 1806, Queen consort Louise of Prussia became Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment. Subsequently it was renamed to Königin-Dragoner (The Queen's Dragoons) per royal order on 5 March 1806. After the death of the Queen a royal order from 4 August 1810 declared that the regiment should forever bear the name \"Regiment of the Queen\" (\"Regiment der Königin\"). Thus it was called Regiment Königin-Dragoner until 5 November 1816. On 6 November 1816 it was renamed to 1. Dragoner Regiment (Königin) (1st Dragoon Regiment (Queen)). From 28 May 1819 on it was restructured into a cuirassier regiment and was then called 2. Kürassier Regiment Königin. Its final name was awarded on 4 June 1860, Kürassier Regiment \"Königin\" (Pommersches) Nr. 2 (Cuirassier Regiment \"Queen\" (Pomeranian) No. 2).\n\nIn the War of the Sixth Coalition, the Queen's Dragoons fought in the battle of Ligny, the battle of Waterloo and at Meaux in 1815/1816.\n\nThe regiment was mobilised in the Second Schleswig War and went to war but did not see considerable action.\n\nIn the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, the cuirassiers took part in the battle of Königgrätz amongst others.\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian war, the regiment fought at Colombey on 14 August and at Gravelotte on 18 August 1870. From 1 September to 29 October 1870 the regiment was part of the army that besieged Metz and Thionville. After that followed engagements near Beaume la Rolande, Monnaie, Danzé and on 6 and 7 January 1871 at St. Amand and Villechauvre-Villeprocher.\n\nThe regiment's campaigns in World War I were mostly in cooperation with the 2nd Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment No. 9 as part of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade/6th Cavalry Division. Engagements and tasks include:\n\n\nAfter the ceasefire the regiment retreated home to Pomerania. It was formally disbanded in 1919.\n\n\n\n"}

The following year, \"Willesee\" moved to the earlier 6:30 p.m. timeslot and extended to five nights a week, running until 1988, when Willesee's production company, Transmedia, sold the rights to the program to the Nine Network.\n\nWhen Willesee left the presenting role, former \"60 Minutes\" presenter Jana Wendt took over on 18 January 1988 and the show once again became \"A Current Affair\". This was the same week the Seven Network's soap opera \"Home and Away\" was introduced, and in Melbourne where Derryn Hinch debuted rival current affairs program \"Hinch At Seven\"..\n\nThe Seven Network introduced direct competition with \"Real Life\", which later became \"Today Tonight\". Jana Wendt left the program in November 1992, unhappy with an ACA story showing topless women.\n\nIn 1993, original \"ACA\" presenter Mike Willesee took over for the whole year. In February 1994, Ray Martin took over. Martin signed off at the end of November 1998.\n\nWhen Mike Munro was axed from the program in 2002, he returned to \"This Is Your Life\", \"60 Minutes\", and later \"National Nine News\" in Sydney.\n\nAfter Mike Munro's departure, Ray Martin returned in February 2003, and signed off again at the start of December 2005. During the 2005/2006 holiday period, the Nine Network announced that \"ACA\" was to be \"rested\" for four weeks to enable a major revamp of the production to take place. On 30 January 2006, two weeks after the program's return, \"ACA\" was re-launched with new presenter Tracy Grimshaw.\n\nLaunching in 1991, QTQ-9 in Brisbane produced a local version of the program, titled \"Extra\". It carried local stories including the lead up to its NRL Grand Finals. Despite its eighteen long years of popularity and ratings success, the local current affairs program was axed, due to a major schedule cleanup for making space for Nine's now-scrapped one-hour current affairs program, \"This Afternoon\", hosted by Andrew Daddo, Katrina Blowers and Mark Ferguson from 4:30pm weekdays starting the following Monday after its final ever broadcast. The decision was part of a push to nationalise lead-in content for the network's struggling news bulletins. The game show Hot Seat was moved to replace \"Extra\" at 5.30pm.\n\nIn 2002, NWS-9 in Adelaide produced a local version of the program hosted by weekend news presenter Georgina McGuinness. It carried national stories, but featured more local stories including the lead up to the 2002 AFL Grand Final. The Adelaide edition was short lived due to the very heavy competition of the Seven Network Adelaide's \"Today Tonight\".\n\nIn January 2008, WIN Corporation announced that a new local version of \"ACA\" would be produced in Western Australia to replace the east coast version hosted by Tracy Grimshaw. It was hosted by Louise Momber, with special investigators Peter van Onselen and Michael Southwell.\n\nThe first state based edition since Adelaide in 2002, the program's initial presenter, former news presenter Sonia Vinci, resigned prior to the show's commencement and was replaced by Louise Momber. The program was launched on 20 October 2008. A week later on 27 October, WIN launched an Adelaide version of the show on Adelaide, with Adelaide's \"National Nine News\" reporter Kate Collins presenting. Both versions were short-lived — on 30 November 2009, WIN announced that Perth and Adelaide would return to the national format.\n\n\nLeila McKinnon is the main fill-in presenter when Grimshaw is on leave. Ben Fordham, Deborah Knight, Karl Stefanovic, Brady Halls, Sylvia Jeffreys, Peter Overton and Eddie McGuire, among others, have also filled in for Grimshaw.\n\n\nIn 2009, \"Extra\" was axed with the Nine Network investing money into other areas within the network. All \"Extra\" reporters were spread across the network in other reporting capacities from \"A Current Affair\" to \"Nine News\".\n\n\nMichael Smyth was a fill-in presenter for Kate Collins\n\n\nLike \"Today Tonight\", the program's former rival on Seven, \"A Current Affair\" is often considered by media critics and the public at large to use sensationalist journalism – as depicted in the parody television show \"Frontline\" – and to deliberately present advertising as editorial content, as previously exposed on the ABC program \"Media Watch\". Stories covered by ACA rotate around community issues i.e. diet fads, miracle cures, welfare cheats, shonky builders, negligent doctors, poorly run businesses and corrupt government officials.\n\nIn 1996, the show reported on the Paxton family from the impoverished Melbourne suburb of St Albans. The family were told that the show was about helping the family members to get jobs, but the version that aired claimed that the family were \"dole bludgers\" refusing reasonable offers of employment. After the story aired, the family received death threats.\n\nIn September 2006 ACA was ordered to pay over $320,000 to former Australian swimming coach Greg Hodge in relation to indefensible defamatory allegations made in a 2003 story relating to Hodge's conduct towards a former swim student.\n\nIn March 2010 ACA was found to have defamed acclaimed plastic surgeon Peter Anthony Haertsch in allegations aired in a 2008 report about a Gold Coast woman's breast enlargement procedure, and ordered to pay $268,000 damages.\n\nIn June 2008 ACA broadcast a program about Queensland property developer Lev Mizikovsky. Mizikovsky sued ACA claiming he was defamed by the broadcast and in November 2011 a jury agreed, but found the defamatory meanings were defensible. Mizikovsky is now liable for costs, which are reported to exceed $2 million.\n\nOn 7 November 2012, a segment was broadcast giving the impression that Asian people were taking over a shopping centre in Castle Hill, New South Wales. After numerous viewer complaints, the Australian Communications and Media Authority found the segment had breached the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice in three clauses, including \"containing inaccurate factual material\", \"placing gratuitous emphasis on ethnic origin\" and \"likely to provoke intense dislike and serious contempt on the grounds of ethnic origin\". Stand-in host, Leila McKinnon made an on-air apology on 13 September 2013.\n\n"}

It is the home ballpark of the Spokane Indians, a minor league baseball team in the Class A-Short Season Northwest League.\n\nBuilt in less than four months at the Interstate Fairgrounds, the stadium opened in 1958 and has a seating capacity large for Class A ballpark. The facility was built for Triple-A in the Pacific Coast League, which it hosted for 24 of its first 25 seasons. The parent club in 1958 was the Los Angeles Dodgers, who had just moved out west from Brooklyn and moved their PCL affiliate, the Los Angeles Angels, north to Spokane. They stayed for fourteen seasons, through 1971, then departed to New Mexico and became the Albuquerque Dukes.\n\nAfter one year in the short-season Northwest League as a Dodger affiliate, the Triple-A PCL returned in 1973, from Portland, as the Texas Rangers' top affiliate. The Milwaukee Brewers became the Indians' parent club in 1976, the Seattle Mariners in 1979, and the California Angels in 1982. The Indians left for Las Vegas after the 1982 season and the NWL returned in 1983 and has remained for over three decades.\n\nThe preceding minor league ballpark in Spokane was Ferris Field, which was about a mile (1½ km) west, on the west side of Playfair Race Course. Named for city attorney George M. Ferris, its original wooden grandstand was built in 1936. Ferris was a former player and manager for the Indians who secured funding from the Works Progress Administration to build it. A fire in October 1948 damaged most of the grandstands, and it was rebuilt using concrete and steel in the spring of 1949.\n\nEarlier baseball venues in Spokane were Recreation Park (), Natatorium Park (), and the original Twickenham Park.\n\nIn 1954, four-year-old Memorial Stadium (now Joe Albi Stadium) was considered as a potential minor league baseball venue.\n\nFor three seasons beginning in 2004, the Gonzaga Bulldogs used the stadium as its home venue while its current venue was being built. Their former ballpark was displaced by the new McCarthey Athletic Center.\n\nIn 2011, the Spokane Chiefs hosted the first outdoor game in Western Hockey League history at Avista Stadium on January 15; the home team routed the Kootenay Ice \n\nNaming rights were purchased in 1998 (and the stadium renamed after the 1999 season) by Avista, the Spokane-based utility founded in 1889 as Washington Water Power Company.

Planned Parenthood of Northern New England\n\nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, 546 U.S. 320 (2006), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving a facial challenge to New Hampshire's parental notification abortion law. The First Circuit had ruled that the law was unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement was proper. The Supreme Court vacated this judgment and remanded the case, but avoided a substantive ruling on the challenged law or a reconsideration of prior Supreme Court abortion precedent. Instead, the Court only addressed the issue of remedy, holding that invalidating a statute in its entirety \"is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.\"\n\nThe opinion was delivered by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who had been significantly responsible for developing the Court's recent abortion jurisprudence. This decision was O'Connor's last opinion on the Court before her retirement on January 31, 2006.\n\nIn June, 2003, the New Hampshire Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act, \"an act requiring parental notification before abortions may be performed on unemancipated minors,\" was narrowly passed by the New Hampshire General Court. It was signed into law on June 19, 2003 by Governor Craig Benson, who had lobbied heavily for the law, with an effective date of December 31, 2003.\n\nOn November 17, 2003, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, Concord Feminist Health Center of Portsmouth, Feminist Health Center of Portsmouth, and Wayne Goldner, M.D. filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Parental Notification Act was unconstitutional and a preliminary injunction to prevent its enforcement once it became effective. On December 29, 2003, Judge Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire issued an order finding the Parental Notification Act unconstitutional and permanently enjoining its enforcement.\n\nDiClerico found the Act unconstitutional on the following grounds:\n\nDiClerico declined to rule on the plaintiffs' other claim, that the Act was unconstitutional for failing to provide specific protections for the confidentiality of a minor seeking a judicial waiver.\n\nNew Hampshire Attorney General Peter Heed appealed the district court's order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Heed argued that the court should apply the \"no set of circumstances\" standard set forth in \"United States v. Salerno\", 481 U.S. 739 (1987). A three judge panel composed of Chief Judge Michael Boudin, Circuit Judge Juan R. Torruella and District Judge Saris unanimously affirmed the judgment by Judge DiClerico for the same reasons he stated.\n\nAttorney General Kelly Ayotte, who replaced Heed in 2004, appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States over the objections of Benson's successor, Governor John Lynch. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case, which was the first case challenging an abortion law that the Court had accepted in five years. Lynch subsequently submitted an \"amicus curiae\" brief in opposition to the Parental Notification Act.\n\nThe Court vacated the judgment of the First Circuit in a unanimous decision authored by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The Court did not revisit any abortion precedents, such as its decision in \"Casey\".\n\nIn its ruling the Court found that the following three propositions were established:\n\nThe Court considered under what circumstances federal courts can enjoin enforcement of abortion laws if in some cases such laws would have the effect of regulating abortion more strictly than is consistent with Supreme Court precedent, as the New Hampshire law did in some circumstances.\n\nThe Court ruled that in such circumstances facial invalidation of a statute would be inappropriate if the statute could be narrowed sufficiently by judicial interpretation. It raised the question of what the appropriate judicial remedy would be if a statute's enforcement would be unconstitutional in medical emergencies. The court ruled that \"invalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief.\"\n\nThe New Hampshire law was repealed in 2007, making rehearing at the district court level moot.\n\nThe New Hampshire parental notification law was passed again in 2011 after the Republican controlled House and Senate overrode then Democrat governor John Lynch's veto.\n\n\n\n\nRespondent\n"}
{"id": "2276760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276760", "title": "Sister, Sister (TV series)", "text": "Sister, Sister (TV series)\n\nSister, Sister is an American television sitcom starring identical twins Tia and Tamera Mowry. It premiered on April 1, 1994, and concluded on May 23, 1999 after six seasons. The premise was that Tia Landry and Tamera Campbell were separated at birth and one was adopted by a single mother while the other was adopted by a couple, although the mother died shortly afterward; 14 years later the two accidentally found each other and reunited. \n\nThe series was created by Kim Bass, Gary Gilbert, and Fred Shafferman, and produced by de Passe Entertainment and Paramount Network Television. The cast also featured Jackee Harry as Tia's mother, Tim Reid as Tamera's father, and Marques Houston as their annoying neighbor. RonReaco Lee and Deon Richmond joined the cast in the fifth season.\n\n\"Sister, Sister\" was picked up by ABC as a midseason replacement and debuted on April 1, 1994, as part of the network's TGIF comedy lineup. The show later moved to a new timeslot for the 1994–95 season, but ABC announced that it was cancelling the program due to low ratings and its final episode aired April 28, 1995. The WB, which was still in its infancy in 1995, picked up \"Sister, Sister\" to replace the cancelled \"Muscle\" on its Wednesday night lineup of shows and the third season debuted on September 6, 1995. The program found its niche as part of The WB's lineup and aired for four additional seasons on the network, with the final episode airing on May 23, 1999.\n\nIn January 2018, a revival of \"Sister, Sister\" was confirmed and is currently in the works. As of 2019, it is currently unknown when or if the revival will happen. \n\nIn the pilot, the twins are reunited during a chance encounter shopping at a clothing store at the mall with their adoptive parents. \n\nTia Landry (Tia Mowry) is the intelligent twin from inner city Detroit, where her adoptive mother Lisa (Jackée Harry) works as a seamstress; Tamera Campbell (Tamera Mowry) is the boy-crazy twin from the suburbs, where her adoptive father Ray (Tim Reid) owns a successful limousine service. After their unexpected reunion, Ray reluctantly allows Tia and Lisa to move in because Lisa was about to take a job in St. Louis, which would have separated the girls again. The girls' neighbor is nerdy Roger Evans (Marques Houston), an annoying teenager who is infatuated with both of them, and who evolves into a perfect gentleman they both find attractive. In the final season when the girls go off to college, Roger ceases to appear in the series because he was still in high school, though he does return as a guest in the final episode. By the fifth season, Tia and Tamera ended up with steady boyfriends: Tia's is Tyreke Scott (RonReaco Lee) and Tamera's is Jordan Bennett (Deon Richmond).\n\nIn the sixth-season episode \"Father's Day\", the twins meet their biological father Matt Sullivan, a white famous photojournalist who never married their mother, Racelle Gavin, because they never got the chance: she was asked to paint a mural in Florida and he was assigned \"the opportunity of a lifetime\" in the Middle East; when he left, Racelle told him she'd join him in Tel Aviv but never mentioned her pregnancy, and after 6 months she stopped writing. When she died, Matt wasn't allowed to see the girls because he couldn't prove he was their father, and when he searched for them later, he never found them because they had been adopted separately. \n\nFor the first five seasons, the series often had Tia and Tamera, either together or separately, break the fourth wall by talking directly to the viewer. During the ABC run, Tia and Tamera would address the audience on some of the goings on in the storyline involving them and occasionally other main characters, usually Roger. After the series moved to The WB, the breaking of the fourth wall was limited mainly to certain episodes and usually only in the teaser scenes and featured increasingly less often by the fourth season. For some of the episodes in the fifth season, it was included but was dropped by the middle of the fifth season. The sixth and final season was the only season that did not include it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series' original theme song was written and composed by Tim Heintz, Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn. Season one was the only season using the full version, with the short middle instrumental portion, vocalizations and the line \"Living underneath one roof, no it won't be trouble-proof\" dropped in season 2, though the short instrumental and vocalizations were restored in season 3. An updated version of the theme song was used starting in Season 5, composed by Heintz, Petersen, Quinn and Kurt Farquhar, who composed the music score for most of the series (save for Season 3, when the score was composed by Paul A. Kreiling), and performed by Tia and Tamera Mowry; this version used the same tune, but a slower tempo and lyrics that emphasized the two characters' differences and increased maturity. The season 5 version of the theme began with the end of the original theme prior to the start of the theme song. An instrumental version of the final theme was used as a closing theme for the final two seasons, though with the exception of the episode \"Designer Genes\", it was generally played over a blooper reel during the closing credits.\n\nThe opening sequence used in the first two seasons, designed by Twin Art, opens with the sound of two spanks and crying babies over a black screen as animated crying babies appear with the word \"separated\" between them, then showing Ray and Lisa each holding babies representing Tamera and Tia with the word \"adopted\" appearing between both. The main cast are shown in front of a white background with various animations around them, ending with Tia, Tamera, Ray and Lisa at a couch with an animated roof over it (pushed overhead by Ray), which morphs into the title logo. The sequence was shortened with the theme song in season two and modified to include Marques Houston as Roger, who became a contract cast member that season (Houston, as Roger, is shown peeking from an animated door which Tia and Tamera promptly close on him).\n\nSeasons 3 and 4 used a computer-animated sequence by Pittard-Sullivan, with the main cast's video headshots in a stop-motion effect, opening with two babies drifting away from each other into two backgrounds: one, the city (which is actually the pre-September 11, 2001 Manhattan skyline, despite the fact the series was set in Detroit) and the other, a country road with the word \"separated\" between them, then showing Ray and Lisa each holding babies in a similar manner as the previous sequence with a rotating \"adopted\", then showing the cast in front of different backdrops (some which include cutouts of objects). It ends with the cast (sans Marques Houston) walking into each other, then getting themselves together over changing cloud backdrops, one which features two roadsigns, before the title logo appears. The cast's surnames are animated and in a variant of the show's logotype. This was the only time the intro remained exactly the same, though by season four, the intro became a bit outdated as Tia and Tamera dropped the wavy hair, tams and plaid outfits for straight hair and trendier fashions, and Roger stopped wearing braids.\n\nThe final two seasons used a music video-style sequence, designed by Paramount Digital Design; Marques Houston remained in the sequence despite his appearances on the series decreasing midway through the fifth season, and Houston was replaced in the sequence by RonReaco Lee and Deon Richmond for the sixth season. Because virtually the same sequence was used as the season before, viewers may notice that in the final part of the second version of the sequence before the title logo when the cast dances together that Richmond and Lee do not appear in the black-and-white shots and are digitally inserted in the regular shots with Tia and Tamera Mowry, Tim Reid and Jackée Harry.\n\nAfter being picked up by The WB in 1995, reruns of the first two seasons of \"Sister, Sister\" were broadcast in early primetime as part of the network's then-newly launched Sunday night lineup during the 1995–1996 season, in addition to the first-run episodes of the series that aired on the WB's Wednesday night schedule. The series has been aired on various broadcast television networks in the U.S. after the series finale on The WB Television Network. From September 1998 to September 1999, Paramount Domestic Television (now CBS Television Distribution) distributed the series to Fox, The WB and UPN network affiliates, such as WWOR-TV (who aired the show reruns weeknights at 6:30pm in New York City) around the United States, airing depending on market. In some markets such as New York City (6:30pm), Philadelphia (5:30pm), Washington, D.C. (5pm & 5:30pm), Atlanta (2:30pm), and Bakersfield (9am & 9:30am), reruns of \"Sister, Sister\" were replaced by reruns of \"The Hughleys\" in September 2002.\n\nThe series formerly aired reruns on The N, Disney Channel, ABC Family, BET, WGN America, Up (formerly GMC TV), Centric, and Hub Network. It currently airs reruns on Fuse.\n\nDisney Channel airings had most episodes edited for content deemed by the channel as unsuitable for its pre-teen audience; the edited Disney Channel versions were also the syndication package of the show that aired on sister network ABC Family, with the exception of the season two episode \"Tattoo\" that was omitted from Disney Channel airings. GMC also airs episodes with content the channel deems inappropriate usually muted or removed entirely, ranging from mild suggestive dialogue said by Roger to tame phrases such as \"shut up\", \"butt\", \"dumb\" and \"pervert\"; whereas the airings on other channels were the original syndicated prints.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the series was aired on Nickelodeon and the Seven Network; in the United Kingdom, \"Sister, Sister\" was aired on Nickelodeon, and on Channel 4 between 1995 and 2000 as the channel had the terrestrial rights to the show. In the UK, Nickelodeon aired Sister Sister again in 2009 but only showed episodes from the first four seasons. It currently airs on Trace Vault in the UK, which also shows classic Teenage comedies like \"Kenan and Kel\" and \"Moesha\" in addition to music videos. It also aired in Ireland, on RTÉ2.\n\nIn Latin America, \"Sister, Sister\" used to air on Nickelodeon in the late 1990s and early 2000s. On October 21, 2009 it debuted on open television Rede Record, but was taken off on October 30, 2009, the cause for this is unknown.\n\nCBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released the first and second seasons of \"Sister, Sister\" on DVD in Region 1 in 2008 and 2009. As of September 2014, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.\n\nOn May 4, 2015, it was announced that Visual Entertainment Inc. (VEI) had acquired the distribution rights to the series for Region 1 (encompassing the United States and Canada). It was subsequently announced on December 28, 2015, that VEI (through its deal with CBS Television Distribution) would release a complete DVD set of the series, \"Sister, Sister: The Complete Collection\" (which includes all six seasons), in Region 1 on January 19, 2016, the release date was then pushed back to March 18, 2016. The Mowry twins 2000 television film \"Seventeen Again\" is also included as a bonus disc on the \"Complete Collection\" set. On May 26, 2017, VEI released separate \"Seasons 1–3\" and \"Seasons 4–6\" sets of the series.\n\nIn June 2012 interview with \"TV Guide\", both Tia Mowry and Tamera Mowry have said they would like to reunite the cast for a reunion film. They were thinking of doing a \"Twins in the city\" plot, like the twins in New York City.\n\nIn 2017, rumors started developing about a potential continuation of \"Sister, Sister\", both Tia and Tamera have confirmed that talks are ongoing and that a sequel series is very close to happening.\n\nIn October 2017, Tia Mowry stated in an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\" that a revival of the series was \"definitely closer than ever\" and that she is \"getting excited\" about the possibility. She also said that she believed Jackée Harry and Tim Reid would be a part of the revival if it were to take place. \n\nOn January 16, 2018, while appearing on \"Steve\", Harry confirmed the revival, stating that \"it's happening\".\n\nAs of 2019, the reboot has been put on hold indefinitely. Tia has commented that \"To be honest with you, I hate to pop the balloon.\" \"Sister, Sister kind of looks dead right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Before the Second Sudanese Civil War the Shilluk also lived in a number of settlements on the northern bank of the Sobat River, close to where the Sobat joins the Nile.\n\nThe Shilluk are the fourth largest ethnic group of Southern Sudan, after the Azande and their neighbours the Dinka and Nuer.\n\nTheir language is called \"Dhøg Cøllø\", \"dhøg\" being the Shilluk word for language and mouth. It belongs to the Luo branch of the Western Nilotic subfamily of the Nilotic languages.\n\nThe shilluk and the Anuak are the closest related members of the Luo Nilotic groups, many of the words in the shilluk language are made up of words from dha anywaa or the Anuak language. Historically, the Shilluk were led by a king Reth who is considered to be from the divine lineage of the culture hero Nyikang, and whose health is believed to affect that of the nation. Formerly, their society was fairly hierarchical, with castes of royals, nobles, commoners, and slaves. Like most Nilotic groups, cattle-raising formed a large part of their economy; however, agriculture and fishing were more significant than usual, and most were sedentary. The Shilluk people created the Shilluk Kingdom which existed in Southern Sudan since (1454 to Present).\n\nMost \"Shilluk\" have converted to Christianity, while some still follow the traditional religion or a mixture of the two; small numbers have converted to Islam. The Shilluk pride themselves in being one of the first Nilotic groups to accept Christianity, the other being the Anuak people. The Episcopal Church of the Sudan which dates the event to the late 19th Century when the Church Mission Society first began to send missionaries.\n\nColonial policies and missionary movements have divided \"Shilluk\" into between the Catholic and Protestant denominations. The Catholic Church was historically assigned the western bank of the Nile and ran missions stations at Lul, Detwoc, Tonga and Yoynyang, while the American Inland Mission ran a mission station at Doleib Hill, located to the south of Malakal on the eastern side of the Nile, but situated on the Sobat river. The Shilluk were a minority in the SPLM faction for most of the Second Sudanese Civil War, their number peaking in the late 1980s and the pre-ceasefire fighting in 2004.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), in an attempt to disarm the tribe and stop a local Shilluk rebellion, burned a number of villages and killed an untold number of civilians in South Sudan's Shilluk Kingdom. Over 10,000 people were displaced in the midst of the rainy season and sent fleeing into the forest, often naked, without bedding, shelter or food, with many children dying from hunger and cold.\n\nViolence has started again in April 2011 with a SPLA crackdown on rebel controlled regions.

In 2019, the ballpark became known as Funko Field. The football stadium has been home to the Everett Reign, a women's football team, since 2013.

A plaque on the sidewalk marks the site just outside the left field wall.\n\nThe baseball stadium underwent extensive renovations in 1998, at a cost of $5 million. The upgrade increased capacity by 1,400 seats to the present 3,682 and added a larger concession area and new lighting. The renovation was funded by a motel-hotel tax approved by the Washington State Legislature in 1994.\n\nOn October 17, 2017, citing the poor condition of the field's natural grass surface when the stadium was used by the Everett High School and Everett Community College baseball teams, which rendered the field near-unusable for games played by both schools, the natural grass field was switched to an artificial surface. Work began on October 31, 2017, and was completed in April 2018. It is one of three ballparks in the Northwest League to have an artificial turf field. The Eugene Emeralds' PK Park and the Hillsboro Hops' Ron Tonkin Field are the others.\n\nOn March 19, 2019, the Everett School Board approved a $1.1 million, eight-year sponsorship agreement with local toymaker Funko to brand the baseball field as Funko Field at Everett Memorial Stadium.\n\nThe stadium's parking lot was home to a temporary COVID-19 testing center during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The testing center, operated by the Snohomish Health District, opened on March 23 and closed on April 16 after processing 2,500 people.\n\n"}

The film tells the story of three sisters who come together to decide the fate of their family home after the death of their revered father. Originally filmed in February 1979, the film was shelved for three years before debuting on June 7, 1982 on NBC.\n\nThe story starts out in a small town in North Carolina with Carolyne Lovejoy (Carroll), a schoolteacher, singing in the church choir at the local church. It is later revealed that she is having an intense affair with the pastor, Reverend Henderson (Dick Anthony Williams) who is also the state senator-elect. Carolyne later comes home to find her younger sister (who she raised after the death of their parents), 20-year old Sissy (Cara), with her boyfriend, Johnny. It is expressed that Sissy is an aspiring ice skater, but Carolyne wants her to follow in her footsteps and become a schoolteacher.\n\nTheir battle continues throughout the movie. Later their estranged sister, Frieda (Cash), who has been living 13 years in the slums of Detroit, shows up with her 12-year-old son, Danny (Kristoff St. John). They decide to stay for a while because Danny has had some trouble with the law and Frieda wants to give him a fresh start in a new environment. While all trying to co-exist in the same house, the sisters' lives turn upside down. Frieda suggest the idea of selling their childhood, stating their youngest sister will be out on her own soon and all the space isn't need for just Carolyne.\n\nFrieda emerges as the troubled black sheep, while Carolyne is knocked off her martyr pedestal when the minister succumbs to Frieda's seduction. Sissy learns that their father never wanted another daughter, but had hoped she would be the son that eluded him. Their mother tried to abort her. After a physical altercation with Frieda and Carolyne, Frieda and Sissy decided to leave. The movie ends with Sissy leaving for New York and Frieda deciding to stay and work things out with Carolyne.\n\nAlthough the movie was filmed in February 1979, NBC chose to withhold it until June 1982, when it aired during primetime. According to \"JET\", Fred Silverman, who was the head executive of the network at the time, decided not to air the film because it did not match his preferred formats of \"action-packed or comedy shows,\" and that the film's focus on the intense personal dramas of middle-class blacks would not appeal to white sensibilities of the late 1970s. After Silverman's resignation, the new network president, Grant Tinker, decided to make his mark on NBC's programming by debuting all of the productions that Silverman had shelved.\n\nThough set in North Carolina, \"Sister, Sister\" was filmed on location in Montgomery and Opelika, Alabama. The historic Old Ship African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Montgomery was used for the church scenes, and the interior and exterior of the Lovejoy house were filmed at the J.W. Darden House in Opelika.\n\nThe film won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special. Cara won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Television Movie, Mini-Series or Dramatic Special for her role in the film.\n\n"}

It is described as a member of the family Madtsoiidae, that includes the species such as \"Wonambi naracoortensis\", present in Australia until the Pleistocene.\n\nThe name of the genus is derived from traditional name given by the people of Arnhem Land to the Rainbow serpent. They were large snakes, up to 6 metres long and 300 millimetres thick, that are more closely resemble \"Varanus\" (monitors) than small burrowing lizards. John Scanlon has presented this as evidence of descent from the former, rather than burrowing ancestors that evolved into the elongate and legless snakes. The fossil material described by this species includes a rare example of a complete skull and mandible, often crushed in the fossilisation process, that was preserved in the soft limestone of a body of fresh water. This was found at the Riversleigh fossil site in northwest Queensland.\n"}

The ballpark is adjacent to Interstate 5, just beyond the right field fence, and sits at an approximate elevation of above sea level. The Volcanoes have won five Northwest League championships, in 1998, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2009. The team moved to Salem-Keizer in 1997, after two seasons in Bellingham, Washington, preceded by eleven years in Everett.\n\nThe Stadium won a Design Award from the American Institute of Architects. Since its construction, numerous upgrades have been completed at Volcanoes Stadium including 3 major buildings: A 1,000 sq. ft. building was constructed to serve as a Weight Room for the Team and a 5,000+ sq. ft. building was built (2018) to serve as an indoor hitting facility, it houses four (4) cages. Plus, a 1,200 sq. ft. group hospitality building was constructed.

The model's name comes from a common application, the use of such models to represent the current size of a population where the transitions are literal births and deaths. Birth–death processes have many applications in demography, queueing theory, performance engineering, epidemiology, biology and other areas. They may be used, for example, to study the evolution of bacteria, the number of people with a disease within a population, or the number of customers in line at the supermarket.\n\nWhen a birth occurs, the process goes from state \"n\" to \"n\" + 1. When a death occurs, the process goes from state \"n\" to state \"n\" − 1. The process is specified by birth rates formula_1 and death rates formula_2.\n\nFor recurrence and transience in Markov processes see Section 5.3 from Markov chain.\n\nConditions for recurrence and transience were established by Samuel Karlin and James McGregor.\n\nBy using Extended Bertrand's test (see Section 4.1.4 from Ratio test) the conditions for recurrence, transience, ergodicity and null-recurrence can be derived in a more explicit form.\n\nFor integer formula_6 let formula_7 denote the formula_8th iterate of natural logarithm, i.e. formula_9 and for any formula_10, \nformula_11.\n\nThen, the conditions for recurrence and transience of a birth-and-death process are as follows.\n\nwhere the empty sum for formula_17 is assumed to be 0.\n\nConsider one-dimensional random walk formula_22 that is defined as follows. Let formula_23, and formula_24 where formula_25 takes values formula_26, and the distribution of formula_27 is defined by the following conditions:\nwhere formula_29 satisfy the condition formula_30.\n\nThe random walk described here is a discrete time analogue of the birth-and-death process (see Markov chain) with the birth rates \nand the death rates\nSo, recurrence or transience of the random walk is associated with recurrence or transience of the birth-and-death process.\n\nwhere the empty sum for formula_17 is assumed to be zero.\n\nIf a birth-and-death process is ergodic, then there exists steady-state probabilities formula_43 where formula_44 is the probability that the birth-and-death process is in state formula_45 at time formula_46 The limit exists, independent of the initial values formula_47 and is calculated by the relations:\n\nThese limiting probabilities are obtained from the infinite system of differential equations for formula_50\n\nand the initial condition formula_53\n\nIn turn, the last system of differential equations is derived from the system of difference equations that describes the dynamic of the system in a small time formula_54. During this small time formula_54 only three types of transitions are considered as one death, or one birth, or no birth nor death. The probability of the first two of these transitions has the order of formula_54. Other transitions during this small interval formula_54 such as \"more than one birth\", or \"more than one death\", or \"at least one birth and at least one death\" have the probabilities that are of smaller order than formula_54, and hence are negligible in derivations. If the system is in state \"k\", then the probability of birth during an interval formula_54 is formula_60, the probability of death is formula_61, and the probability of no birth and no death is formula_62. For a population process, \"birth\" is the transition towards increasing the population size by 1 while \"death\" is the transition towards decreasing the population size by 1.\n\nA pure birth process is a birth–death process where formula_63 for all formula_64.\n\nA pure death process is a birth–death process where formula_65 for all formula_64.\n\n\"M/M/1 model\" and \"M/M/c model\", both used in queueing theory, are birth–death processes used to describe customers in an infinite queue.\n\nIn queueing theory the birth–death process is the most fundamental example of a queueing model, the \"M/M/C/K/formula_67/FIFO\" (in complete Kendall's notation) queue. This is a queue with Poisson arrivals, drawn from an infinite population, and \"C\" servers with exponentially distributed service times with \"K\" places in the queue. Despite the assumption of an infinite population this model is a good model for various telecommunication systems.\n\nThe M/M/1 is a single server queue with an infinite buffer size. In a non-random environment the birth–death process in queueing models tend to be long-term averages, so the average rate of arrival is given as formula_68 and the average service time as formula_69. The birth and death process is an M/M/1 queue when,\n\nThe differential equations for the probability that the system is in state \"k\" at time \"t\" are\n\nPure birth process with formula_73 is a particular case of the M/M/1 queueing process. We have the following system of differential equations:\nUnder the initial condition formula_76 and formula_77, the solution of the system is\n\nThat is, a (homogeneous) Poisson process is a pure birth process.\n\nThe M/M/C is a multi-server queue with \"C\" servers and an infinite buffer. It characterizes by the following birth and death parameters:\n\nand\n\nwith\n\nThe system of differential equations in this case has the form:\n\nPure death process with formula_85 is a particular case of the M/M/C queueing process. We have the following system of differential equations:\nUnder the initial condition formula_88 and formula_89 we obtain the solution\nthat presents the version of binomial distribution depending of time parameter formula_91 (see Binomial process).\n\nThe M/M/1/K queue is a single server queue with a buffer of size \"K\". This queue has applications in telecommunications, as well as in biology when a population has a capacity limit. In telecommunication we again use the parameters from the M/M/1 queue with,\n\nIn biology, particularly the growth of bacteria, when the population is zero there is no ability to grow so,\n\nAdditionally if the capacity represents a limit where the individual dies from over population,\n\nThe differential equations for the probability that the system is in state \"k\" at time \"t\" are\n\nA queue is said to be in equilibrium if the steady state probabilities formula_101 exist. The condition for the existence of these steady-state probabilities in the case of M/M/1 queue is formula_102 and in the case of M/M/C queue is formula_103. The parameter formula_104 is usually called load parameter or utilization parameter. Sometimes it is also called traffic intensity.\n\nUsing the M/M/1 queue as an example, the steady state equations are\n\nThis can be reduced to\n\nSo, taking into account that formula_108, we obtain\n\n\n"}

The work of sculptor Ron Robertson-Swann, \"Vault\" is an abstract, minimalist sculpture built of large thick flat polygonal sheets of prefabricated steel, assembled in a way that suggests dynamic movement. It is painted yellow.\n\nPresently located outside the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, it is a key work in Melbourne's public art collection, and of considerable historical importance to the city.\n\n\"Vault\" has weathered much controversy throughout its existence. Commissioned by the Melbourne City Council after winning a competition in May 1978, for the newly built Melbourne City Square, the sculpture was not even built before it began to attract criticism from conservative media and council factions, on the grounds that its modern form was felt to be unsympathetic to the location. The cost of $70,000 was also felt to be excessive.\n\nThe sculpture had no official name for over two years, and acquired a number of nicknames during this time. Robertson-Swann himself called it \"The Thing\". The steelworkers who constructed it called it \"Steelhenge\". Newspapers gave it the derogatory nickname \"The Yellow Peril\", a name which has stuck. Robertson-Swann eventually officially named the sculpture \"Vault\" in September 1980.\n\nInstalled in the City Square in May 1980, \"Vault\" lasted until December of that year, when its dismantling coincided with the State Government's sacking of the City Council. The Builders Labourers Federation consequently placed bans on further City Square work projects.\n\nIn 1981, the \"Vault\" was re-erected at Batman Park, a less prominent part of the city. It remained there until 2002 when it was moved to a position outside the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in Southbank.\n\nIn 2017, the sculpture was recommended for heritage protection, through inclusion in the City of Melbourne Planning Scheme Heritage Overlay, following a heritage study of the Southbank Area.\n\n\"Vault\" has been inspirational for some built and propositional architectural projects designed in Melbourne. Several of Denton Corker Marshall's works have \"adopted peril's yellow almost as a point of pride and solidarity\" while its form has been manipulated in some works by ARM Architecture (Ashton Raggatt McDougall).\n\n"}

She reached world No. 1 in singles, the 20th in the Open Era, and the first woman from a Scandinavian country to hold the top ranking position. She finished on top of the rankings in both 2010 and 2011.\n\nShe won 30 WTA singles titles, including six in 2010 and 2011, the most in a year by a WTA player from 2008–2011. She was runner-up at the 2009 US Open and the 2010 WTA Tour Championships to Kim Clijsters, and at the 2014 US Open to Serena Williams. She won the 2006 Wimbledon girls' singles title and also holds two WTA titles in doubles. In 2008, Wozniacki won the title of WTA Newcomer of the Year. In 2017, she won the season-ending WTA Finals in Singapore for the first time in her career. Wozniacki won her maiden Grand Slam title at the 2018 Australian Open and returned to the No. 1 ranking on 29 January 2018.\n\nOn 6 December 2019, Wozniacki announced that she would retire from professional tennis following the 2020 Australian Open, held in January.\n\nWozniacki was born in Odense, Denmark, the daughter of Polish immigrants, Piotr Woźniacki and Anna. Anna played on the Polish women's national volleyball team, and Piotr played professional football. The couple moved to Denmark when Piotr signed for the Danish football club Boldklubben 1909. Her older brother, Patrik Wozniacki, is a former professional footballer in Denmark.\n\nWozniacki's playing style centres on \"the defensive aspects of tennis with her anticipation, movement, agility, footwork and speed all first-rate and key parts of her game.\" She also anticipates serves with aggressive footwork. Her two-handed backhand is one of her best weapons as she is capable of turning defence into offence, most notably the backhand down-the-line. Her defensive playing style had her contemporaries label her a counter-puncher; sometimes, she was referred to as a pusher by critics. Following her retirement, The Guardian described Wozniacki as \"one of the most defensive players ever to reach No. 1\", noting her use of the moonball, and stated that her main strengths were her mental fortitude and competitive drive. Despite Wozniacki's excellent footwork and anticipation, and a strong backhand, especially down the line, Wozniacki's forehand remained a weakness throughout her career, due to its lack of depth, power and speed. As noted in the Guardian, \"people questioned why her serve could scale 118mph and yet her forehand could not crack open an egg\".\n\nWozniacki's father, Piotr, was her primary coach since she was 14. Throughout the years, she was coached by Sven Groeneveld through the Adidas Player Development Program. She was briefly coached by Ricardo Sanchez and Thomas Johansson. In October 2013, she hired Thomas Högstedt, but parted ways in January 2014. In the same month, she hired Michael Mortensen, but cut ties with him in March 2014. Since then, Wozniacki decided to be coached again by her father Piotr for the rest of her career.\n\nIn 2009, Wozniacki signed on to become an endorser for the line of tennis apparel designed by Stella McCartney for Adidas. She wore her first 'Adidas by Stella McCartney' tennis dress at the 2009 US Open. She currently has partnership agreements with Babolat, Rolex, Adidas, USANA, The Players' Tribune and Mundipharma. On 20 December 2010, she signed a three-year deal to endorse Turkish Airlines' business class service. In 2012, Wozniacki became an endorser of Compeed BlisterPatch. At the end of 2013 she switched her racquet sponsorship from Yonex back to her long-time partner Babolat. In 2015, Wozniacki became an endorser of Godiva Chocolatier. In 2018 she entered into a partnership with Lympo, a healthy lifestyle motivation app.\n\nAccording to the June 2011 edition of SportsPro, Wozniacki is the world's ninth-most marketable athlete. According to \"Forbes\" in 2011, Wozniacki was the second-highest-earning female athlete in the world.\n\nWozniacki had a career-high junior ranking of No. 2 in the world. She made her debut on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier 18-and-under junior tour that is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in October 2003 at 13 years and 3 months old. During her first month, she entered two Grade 5 events in Denmark, the lowest-level tournament on the tour. Wozniacki reached the final at both singles events, winning the second over compatriot Hanne Skak Jensen. With this success, she moved up to Grade 3 and Grade 4 tournaments, winning her first four singles events of 2004. Her win streak of five tournaments and 27 matches came to an end in April with a semifinal loss to Latisha Chan at the International Juniors Championships in Manila, her first event outside of Scandinavia as well as her first Grade 1 event. From this point on, Wozniacki only competed in Grade A and Grade 1 events, the two highest-level tournaments. She made her Grade A debut at Wimbledon before turning 14, losing her first main draw match. Towards the end of the year, Wozniacki won her first Grade A title at the Osaka Mayor's Cup.\n\nWozniacki won several junior tournaments in 2005, including the Orange Bowl tennis championship. She made her debut on the WTA Tour at Cincinnati's Western & Southern Financial Group Women's Open on 19 July 2005, losing to the top-seeded and eventual champion Patty Schnyder in the first round. In the Nordea Nordic Light Open, her other WTA tournament of the year, she lost to Martina Suchá in the first round.\nIn 2006 she was the top seed at the Australian Open (junior girls' singles), but lost the final to eighth-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. She was seeded second with partner Anna Tatishvili in the doubles tournament, but the pair was knocked out in the semifinals by the French-Italian pair of Alizé Cornet and Corinna Dentoni, who were seeded 8th. In February at the Memphis, she reached her first WTA Tour quarterfinal, beating Kristina Brandi and Ashley Harkleroad before losing to third-seeded Sofia Arvidsson of Sweden. Before Wimbledon Wozniacki won the Liverpool International Tennis Tournament, an exhibition tournament, beating Ashley Harkleroad in the final. Later that year she was given a wildcard to the qualifying draw at Wimbledon, where she was beaten in the first round by Miho Saeki. However, Wozniacki went on to win the Wimbledon girls' singles tournament, beating Slovak Magdaléna Rybáriková in the finals. In August, she reached another WTA Tour quarterfinal, this time at the Nordea Nordic Light Open in Stockholm. She defeated top-100 players Iveta Benešová and Eleni Daniilidou, then lost to eventual champion and third-seeded Zheng Jie.\n\nWozniacki was seeded second in the US Open girls' singles. In the first round, she won the first set against Russian Alexandra Panova, but was disqualified in the second set for verbally abusing an umpire. Wozniacki was said to have used an expletive in referring to a linesman who made a disputed call. However, on her blog, she claimed to have said \"take your sunglasses of [sic]\" and was mistaken for talking to the linesman, when she in fact was criticizing herself after the next point.\n\nIn her last junior tournament, the Osaka Mayor's Cup, she won both the girls' singles and doubles. Her first title on the senior tour came in October when she won the $25,000 tournament in Istanbul by beating Tatjana Malek in the final. Wozniacki was set to face Venus Williams on 27 November in an exhibition match in Copenhagen, but five days before the event, Williams canceled because of an injury. The two did, however, face each other in the Memphis WTA Tier III event on 20 February. Williams beat Wozniacki, ending a nine-match winning streak for Wozniacki. On 29 November Wozniacki was named ambassador for Danish Junior Tennis by the Culture Minister of Denmark at the time, Brian Mikkelsen.\n\nOn 4 February 2007, she won a $75,000 singles title in Ortisei, beating Italian Alberta Brianti. On 4 March, she won the $75,000 tournament in Las Vegas, beating top-seed Akiko Morigami in the final. She obtained a wildcard for the Pacific Life Open main draw and made her Tier I debut there. She was knocked out in the second round by Martina Hingis. She then made the semifinals of the AIG Open in Tokyo in October, her first career WTA Tour semifinal, and as a result became the first Danish woman to reach a WTA semifinal since Tine Scheuer-Larsen at Bregenz in 1986. She was defeated by Venus Williams in straight sets.\n\nAt the Australian Open, Wozniacki defeated Gisela Dulko and 21st seed Alona Bondarenko on her way to the round of 16, where she lost to the eventual finalist and fourth-seeded Ana Ivanovic.

An emancipist could be released from his or her sentence for good behaviour, diligent work or the expiration of his or her sentence. One limitation placed upon emancipists with a conditional pardon – a ticket-of-leave – was that they were not allowed to leave the Australian colonies. This limitation did not apply to former convicts whose terms of servitude had expired, or who had been unconditionally pardoned, and more than half of all male convicts did leave the Australian colonies on the expiration of their sentence [it was more difficult for female emancipists to leave, as they had fewer opportunities of \"working their passage\" away from the colonies].\n\nThe Exclusives (who included many free settlers, civil servants and military officers) often shunned the society of emancipists, and considered them to be little more than criminals. When Governor Lachlan Macquarie invited emancipists to social functions at Government House, for example, many military officers refused to attend.\n\nMacquarie (Governor from 1810 to 1821) insisted that emancipated convicts be treated as social equals and, very conscious of the critical shortage of skills in the young colony, appointed emancipists with talent to official positions. Among these appointments were Francis Greenway as colonial architect and Dr. William Redfern as colonial surgeon. He scandalised settler opinion by appointing another emancipist, Andrew Thompson, as a magistrate.\n\nJohn Hamilton Irving (or Irven, Irwin, or Ervin) was Australia's first emancipist. Irving was a surgeon convicted of larceny on 6 March 1784. He was sentenced to \"seven years beyond the seas,\" and sent on one of the First Fleet transports in 1788. After exhibiting a willing readiness to assist with his exceptional surgical skills, he was emancipated by Governor Arthur Phillip on 28 February 1790, and worked thereafter as an assistant surgeon. On 14 July 1792, Irving's Warrant of Emancipation was received in England and acknowledged by Henry Dundas, the Secretary of State.\n\n"}

Its independence ended in 1834 when the estates not bequeathed to princes Victor and Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfurst were reunited with Hesse-Kassel.\n\nThe line of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) was founded by William IV, surnamed the Wise, eldest son of Philip the Magnanimous. On his father's death in 1567, he received one half of Hesse, with Cassel as his capital; this formed the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. Additions were made to it by inheritance from his brother's possessions. His son, Maurice the Learned (1572–1632) was Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel from 1592 until 1627. Maurice turned Calvinist in 1605, became involved later in the Thirty Years' War, and, after being forced to cede some of his territories to the Darmstadt line, abdicated in 1627 in favour of his son William V (1602-1637). His younger sons received apanages, which created several cadet lines of the house (Hesse-Rotenburg, Hesse-Eschwege and Hesse-Rheinfels), of which, with amalgamation, that of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg survived till 1834.\n\nIn 1627, Ernest (1623–1693), a younger son of Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, received Rheinfels and lower Katzenelnbogen as his inheritance. Some years later, on the deaths of two of his brothers, Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse-Eschwege (1617–1655) and Herman IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg (1607–1658), he added Eschwege, Rotenburg, Wanfried and other districts to his possessions. Ernest, who was a convert to the Roman Catholic Church, was a great traveller and a voluminous writer. About 1700 his two sons, William (d. 1725) and Charles (or Karl) (d. 1711), divided their territories, and founded the families of Hesse-Rotenburg and Hesse-Wanfried. The latter family died out in 1755, when William's grandson, Constantine (d. 1778), reunited the lands except Rheinfels, which had been acquired by Hesse-Kassel in 1735, and ruled them as Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg.\n\nAt the peace of Lunéville in 1801, the part of the landgraviate on the left bank of the Rhine was surrendered to France and, in 1815, other parts were ceded to Prussia, the landgrave Victor Amadeus being compensated by the abbey of Corvey and the Silesian Duchy of Ratibor. Victor was the last male member of his family, so, with the consent of Prussia, he bequeathed his allodial estates to his nephews the princes Victor and Chlodwig of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfurst. When the landgrave died on 12 November 1834 the remaining parts of Hesse-Rotenburg were united with Hesse-Kassel according to the arrangement of 1627. It may be noted that Hesse-Rotenburg was never completely independent of Hesse-Kassel. Perhaps the most famous member of this family was Charles Constantine (1752–1821), a younger son of Landgrave Constantine, who took part in the French Revolution under the name \"Citoyen Hesse\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2276869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2276869", "title": "Educational Pictures", "text": "Educational Pictures\n\nEducational Pictures, also known as Educational Film Exchanges, Inc. or Educational Films Corporation of America, was an American film distribution company founded in 1916 by Earle (E. W.) Hammons (1882–1962). Educational primarily distributed short subjects, and today is probably best known for its series of 1930s comedies starring Buster Keaton, as well as for a series of one-reel comedies featuring the earliest screen appearances of Shirley Temple. The studio also distributed short comedies starring Lloyd Hamilton, who employed the blacklisted \"Fatty\" Arbuckle as a writer-director under the pseudonym William Goodrich.\n\nHammons established the company to make instructional films for schools, but making comedies for theatrical release proved more lucrative. Educational did issue many educational, travelogue, and novelty shorts, but its main enterprise became comedy. Educational's heyday was the 1920s, when the popular silent comedies of Al St. John, Lupino Lane, Lige Conley, Lloyd Hamilton, and Monty Collins complemented many a moviehouse bill as \"the spice of the program.\" Educational also released silent cartoons, including the Felix the Cat series. In 1930, cartoonist Paul Terry signed with Educational to distribute his Terrytoons animated cartoons in America and British countries.\n\nEducational made a smooth transition to sound movies by handling the early talking comedies of pioneer producer Mack Sennett. Sennett also introduced singing star Bing Crosby to movie audiences. But Sennett soon became plagued by financial problems, and he left Educational in 1932. Most of Educational's silent stars made only a few talkies for the studio: Lupino Lane left the company in 1930, followed by Lloyd Hamilton in 1931. Most of the earliest Educational talkies feature silent-comedy veterans with stage experience: Vernon Dent, Harry Gribbon, Raymond McKee, Edward Everett Horton, Daphne Pollard, and Ford Sterling. Educational's most prolific comedian in the 1930s was undoubtedly the Sennett star Andy Clyde, who made 54 comedies.\n\nEducational replaced the Sennett films with star-name comedians. Andy Clyde and Harry Langdon led Educational's release schedule for a few years and then Buster Keaton headlined a series that yielded 16 popular two-reel comedies.\n\nFor a time Educational maintained studios on both coasts. The Hollywood productions, in addition to those of Clyde, Langdon, and Keaton, hosted comedy stars Moran and Mack, Edgar Kennedy, and Ernest Truex. New York-based talent from vaudeville and radio starred in Educational's East Coast productions based at the Astoria Studios: Joe Cook, Tim and Irene Ryan, Sylvia Froos, Warren Hull, Tom Howard and George Shelton, Stoopnagle and Budd, Bert Lahr, and Willie Howard. Many stars made debuts in Educational shorts: Bob Hope, The Ritz Brothers, Milton Berle, June Allyson, Imogene Coca, and Danny Kaye in New York; and Shirley Temple, Joan Davis, and Roy Rogers in Hollywood. During its last year of production, Educational showcased the young comedy/dance team of Herman Timberg, Jr. and Pat Rooney, Jr., singers Niela Goodelle and Lee Sullivan, comic Charles Kemper, and comedian Harriet Hutchins.\n\nTwentieth Century-Fox and its predecessor, Fox Film Corporation, had been distributing Educational product to theaters. In 1937 Fox dropped its line of short comedies and withdrew its support from Educational. Earle Hammons tried to keep his company going while trying to enter the feature-film market with the financially troubled Grand National Pictures. The drain on his finances forced both companies into bankruptcy. The final Educational comedies (with radio and screen comic F. Chase Taylor as \"Col. Stoopnagle\") were released in January 1939, and the film library was sold at auction in 1940. Most were obtained by Astor Pictures, which shrewdly timed its re-releases to cash in on certain performers' popularity. Astor compiled four feature-length comedies showcasing Shirley Temple (\"Our Girl Shirley\", 1942), Danny Kaye (\"The Birth of a Star\", 1945), Bing Crosby (\"The Road to Hollywood\", 1947), and Bob Hope and Milton Berle (\"It Pays to Be Funny\", 1948).\n\nMuch of Educational's silent film library was lost in a laboratory fire in 1937, but the sound comedies survive today.\n\nLike other short-subject producers, Educational Pictures marketed its assorted offerings in individual series. Among these were [Robert] Bruce Scenics (travelogues, 1918–1920), Lyman Howe's Hodge Podge (miscellaneous human-interest shorts; the series outlived its creator); Treasure Chest (miscellaneous subjects); Coronet Comedies (single-reel subjects, 1929–1931 and 1934–1936); Lloyd Hamilton Talking Comedies (1929–1931); Cameo Comedies (single-reel, 1931–1932); Tuxedo Comedies (two-reel, 1924–1931 and 1935–1936); Ideal Comedies (1930–1932); Vanity Comedies (1931–1932); Baby Burlesks (Shirley Temple, one-reel, 1932–1933), Frolics of Youth (Frank Coghlan, Jr. and Shirley Temple, two-reel, 1932–1934), Marriage Wow Comedies (comprising only three two-reel comedies, starring husband-and-wife comics, 1934); Star Personality Comedies (Buster Keaton, Joe Cook, Willie Howard, two-reel, 1934–1938); Young Romance Comedies (two-reel, 1934–1935); Song and Comedy Hits (one-reel musical comedies, 1935–1938); and Col. Stoopnagle's Cavalcade of Stuff (Educational's last and briefest series – only two one-reel comedies, 1939).\n\nBuster Keaton's career suffered a major downturn in the early 1930s and he was fired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1933, after which he embarked to Europe. Upon his return to Hollywood, he made a screen comeback in a series of 16 two-reel comedies for Educational Pictures. Most of these are simple visual comedies, with many of the gags supplied by Keaton himself, often recycling ideas from his family vaudeville act and his earlier films. The high point in the Educational series is \"Grand Slam Opera\", featuring Buster in his own screenplay as an amateur-hour contestant. When the series lapsed in 1937, Keaton returned to MGM as a gag writer.\n\nEducational Pictures's logo consists of a genie's lamp, above which the words \"Educational Pictures\" appear formed by the smoke from the lamp. Below the lamp, enclosed in quotation marks are the words \"The Spice of the Program\".\n\nThe use of the logo in film credits was unique to Educational. The shorts would begin with the opening title card, usually having \"E. W. Hammons presents\" at the top, followed by the title of the short. The Educational logo would then appear full screen. Normally, studios would have their logos appear before the opening titles, while Educational placed its logo after the opening credits. At the end, there would be a standard end title card with the mini-logo for Educational Pictures appearing somewhere in the end title.\n\n\n"}

He later returned to Seattle, where he formed the Bun Family Players and The Western State Hurricanes. Following the disbandment of the latter, he acted as touring keyboardist for Harvey Danger.\n\nIn 2001, Harvey Danger singer/songwriter Sean Nelson suggested that he and Roderick record an album—half of the songs penned by John, and the other half by Sean. Death Cab for Cutie band member Chris Walla had recently opened up the Hall of Justice studio in Seattle and agreed to help them record.\nJohn recruited Joe Bass of Sky Cries Mary and Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne to flesh out several of the songs, and gradually the album evolved to feature only John's songs. After several months, \"The Worst You Can Do Is Harm\" was finished.\n\nJohn traveled to New York, where he played solo shows and began to pen new songs. Several of these songs would eventually be included on The Long Winters' second album, \"When I Pretend to Fall\".\n\nWhile there, he was contacted by Barsuk Records—the label that would release \"The Worst You Can Do Is Harm\"—who made it clear they wanted John to tour to promote the release. He traveled back to Seattle and was joined by Chris Caniglia, former Western State Hurricanes drummer Michael Shilling and Eric Corson on bass. Thus, The Long Winters were born.\n\nSean Nelson of Harvey Danger offered to sing harmony vocals on a number of songs at the band's first live gig. He ended up casually performing with the band for their first few shows before committing to full-time enrollment.\n\nThe original trio responsible for \"The Worst You Can Do Is Harm\"—Roderick, Nelson, and Walla—is often considered the original incarnation of the band. Roderick and Nelson, along with recruits Corson and Shilling (the drummer in Roderick's previous band, the Western State Hurricanes) are the core players behind \"When I Pretend to Fall\", with Nelson having replaced Caniglia as the band's keyboardist. \"When I Pretend to Fall\" was released and Roderick, Nelson, Corson and Shilling embarked on an ambitious series of tours throughout 2003 in support of the album. The band toured North America with Barsuk Records labelmates Nada Surf and Death Cab for Cutie, and later spent November touring Europe. Shilling eventually quit in December 2003, burned out by the hectic touring and lifestyle of the band. With the best wishes of The Long Winters, Nelson left in March 2004 to rekindle his former band Harvey Danger.\n\nAt the time of Nelson's departure, The Long Winters had recently begun rehearsing with Shilling's replacement for the band's 2004 tours, former Death Cab for Cutie percussionist Michael Schorr. Confronted with a double blow to the band's line-up, Roderick took opportunity to reinvent the band again. An east coast tour with The Pernice Brothers, a more fleshed out European tour, and a nationwide tour supporting The Decemberists that would take the band through the spring and well into the summer. Thus, the leaner three-piece version of The Long Winters was born, featuring John Roderick, Eric Corson, and Michael Schorr.\n\nThis extensive spring/summer 2004 tour took its toll on Schorr, who left the band shortly after its completion. Roderick continued to do small promotional events and shows throughout the latter half of 2004 and 2005, often previewing a handful of new Long Winters songs.\n\nThe next incarnation of The Long Winters featured Roderick on vocals, guitars, and keyboard, Corson on bass and back-up vocals, and Nabil Ayers (co-founder of Seattle's Sonic Boom Records) on drums. The band did a tour supporting Keane in October 2005 in support of an EP released October 11, 2005, titled \"Ultimatum\". Roderick did a solo mini tour through Europe in May 2006 to promote the third full-length LP, \"Putting the Days to Bed\", which was released July 25, 2006. In the fall of 2006 the band—now with guitarist/keyboard player Jonathan Rothman replacing Mike Squires—toured the USA, after which they joined the band Keane once again for a European tour. The Long Winters began 2007 with yet another European tour, followed by a month of shows in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn July 2008 the band went back into the studio to work on their fourth (yet untitled) album. In mid-2009 through early-2010, a satiric \"quasi-weekly\" 9 episode series by Roderick entitled \"13 Songs with John\" was made available through YouTube ostensibly focusing on the work he was doing in the studio. None of the episodes actually featured Roderick working in the studio. Through 2011, Roderick, through The Long Winters website, continued to promise the long-awaited new album would be released \"soon.\"\n\nThe Long Winters released a split single with Spiral Stairs in September 2010. Their track was titled \"Connections In Nashville.”\n\nThe Long Winters were featured in a January 2015 episode of Song Exploder, profiling their song \"The Commander Thinks Aloud.\" \n\nIn August 2016, Roderick indicated in a conversation with Dan Benjamin on his podcast \"Road Work\" that he has begun working on the fourth \"Long Winters\" album once again, reworking (in some cases significantly) songs that had been recorded in the sessions dating back to 2007. While he did not indicate whether or not studio recording time was imminent, he did state that he had “almost an entire record of songs now”.\n\nThe song \"It's a Departure\" from \"Putting The Days To Bed\" is used as the theme song for the podcast \"My Brother, My Brother, and Me\".\n\n\n\n"}

He was the head football coach at the University of Florida from 2002 to 2004 and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 2005 to 2011.\n\nZook is a native of Ohio and an alumnus of Miami University, where he played college football. He has worked as an assistant coach in the National Football League (NFL) with the Pittsburgh Steelers (1996–1998), Kansas City Chiefs (1999), and New Orleans Saints (2000–2001). In August 2012, he was hired as a college football studio analyst by CBS Sports. He was also employed as the special teams coach for the Green Bay Packers. In 2019, he was the special teams coordinator and secondary coach for the Salt Lake Stallions of the Alliance of American Football (AAF).\n\nRonald Andrew Zook was born in Ashland, Ohio and raised in nearby Loudonville. At Loudonville High School, Zook played basketball, track, and football. Upon graduating, he was offered a track scholarship to Purdue University and received offers to play football at several small colleges in the Midwest. However, Zook wanted to play Division I football, so he decided to walk on at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He made the team, and by his senior season, Zook was a starting defensive back and a co-captain for the Miami Redskins (which changed to the RedHawks in 1997). He graduated with a bachelor's degree in comprehensive science in 1976.\n\nZook started coaching football immediately upon graduating from college, beginning his career in 1976 as the defensive backs coach at Orrville High School in Orrville, Ohio under head coach Mo Tipton.\n\nIn 1978, Zook began his college football coaching career when he became a graduate assistant at Murray State University. Through the 1980s, Zook held coaching positions with a number of college football teams, serving as a defensive coordinator at Cincinnati and Kansas and as a position coach at Tennessee, Virginia Tech, and Ohio State.\n\nBeginning in 1991, Zook served as defensive coordinator for three seasons at the University of Florida under head coach Steve Spurrier. After the 1993 season, Spurrier reassigned Zook to be the special teams coordinator, a move considered by many to be a demotion due to the team's unsatisfactory performance on pass defense. Zook's special teams units performed well enough during the 1994 season that he was offered the defensive coordinator position at Michigan State, prompting Spurrier to give him the title of associate head coach to help keep him at Florida.\n\nFlorida defensive coordinator Bobby Pruett left to become the head coach at Marshall University in January 1995 and Zook was promoted to take his place, becoming Florida's defensive coordinator once again. However, the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers offered Zook the job of special teams coordinator just one month later and he accepted, leaving the college game for a time. With Zook leaving, Bob Stoops was brought in to run Florida's defense.\n\nAfter leaving Florida, Zook served three seasons as special teams coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, then was the defensive backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs in 1999. KC would finish with a 9-7 record, 16th in passing yards allowed, and James Hasty would have 7 INT while Cris Dishman finished with 5 INT.. In the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Zook served as the defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints. In 2000, the Saints finished 10–6 with Zook's defense ranking tenth in points allowed. DT La'Roi Glover led the team with 17 Sacks followed by 12 from DE Joe Johnson and 11 by DE Darren Howard.\n\nIn January 2002, Steve Spurrier resigned from Florida to explore head coaching opportunities in the NFL, eventually signing with the Washington Redskins. Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley sought to replace him with either Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan or Oklahoma's Bob Stoops, but each decided to remain with their respective teams. Foley's next choice was Zook, who accepted the job. Given the success of Spurrier's 12-year tenure, expectations at Florida were high, and seemingly \"settling\" for Zook as the Gators' new coach was not popular with many students and supporters. Others did not understand why the university would hire a man who was demoted as a coordinator on the same staff to be head coach. Within a day of Zook's hiring, one fan started a website called \"FireRonZook.com\" that gained national media attention. Many fraternity houses hung banners from week to week either praising Zook or calling for his firing.\n\nZook was head coach at Florida for three seasons. The Gators compiled records of 8–5 (2002), 8–5 (2003) and 7–5 (2004). While Zook's tenure saw modest success, it was well short of what Gator fans had come to expect. In his three seasons, the Gators lost six games at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. By comparison, Spurrier lost only five home games in 12 years. Many of the losses were fourth quarter comebacks by the opposition, causing many fans to question the prevent defense which was employed. Zook did not beat a ranked opponent at home during his time at Florida. Zook was fired before the end of the 2004 season after a 38–31 road loss to the Mississippi State Bulldogs (who were 1–5 prior to the game, including a home loss to Division I-AA Maine). He had not helped his cause by getting into a heated argument with several fraternity members a few weeks earlier after being called in to defuse a dispute between the brothers and his players. Zook finished the regular season, but did not coach the Gators in the Peach Bowl because he had already accepted the head coach's job at Illinois. Defensive coordinator Charlie Strong coached the Gators in the Peach Bowl. After Zook's departure, his successor Urban Meyer won a national title in 2006, largely with players whom Zook had recruited.\n\nDuring his time at Florida, Zook did have some notable accomplishments. He handed both the 2002 Georgia Bulldogs and 2003 LSU Tigers their only loss of the year. His Gators defeated three highly ranked teams in succession in 2003, all away from home (LSU, Arkansas and Georgia). In his final game he defeated the Florida State Seminoles at Tallahassee, something Steve Spurrier never did. This victory occurred on the night FSU dedicated Bobby Bowden Field, leading Gator fans to refer to it as Ron Zook Field. Zook had winning records against SEC foes Georgia (2–1) and Auburn (1–0). Zook was regarded as a fine recruiter who brought a great deal of talent to Florida during his tenure as head coach. Following the Gators' victory over Ohio State in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, Urban Meyer praised Zook for recruiting the large class of seniors who played in the game. Twenty-two of the 24 starters were recruited to Florida by Zook.\n\nIn 2005, the University of Illinois hired Zook to replace Ron Turner as the head coach of the Illinois Fighting Illini football team. Zook inherited a program which had become a disaster since winning the Big Ten championship in 2001. They had only won nine games in the three seasons since, and only five games in Big Ten play. In Zook's inaugural season of 2005, Illinois finished with an overall record of 2–9, and a record of 0–8 in Big Ten games.\n\nDespite his team's past struggles, Zook improved the ability of Illinois to recruit top football talent. According to one source, the 2006 recruiting class was one of the 30 best in college football. Despite this, they finished the 2006 season 1–7 in the conference and 2–10 overall. While the record did not improve, the play on the field did as the Illini nearly upset top ranked Ohio State in Champaign before losing 17–10. Additionally, the Illini played well against Iowa, Wisconsin, and Penn State (they lost 63–10 the year before; Penn State led 56–3 at halftime) but ended up losing close games (they were down 15–12 at Penn State until Penn State broke open a close game to make it 26–12).\n\nThe 2006 recruiting class included Isiah \"Juice\" Williams of Chicago Vocational High School, considered to be one of the top quarterback recruits in the country. In late 2006, Zook signed Arrelious Benn, one of the top wide receiver prospects in the 2007 class. More recently, Zook also won over Simeon High School standout Martez Wilson along with Florida prospect D'Angelo McCray. This class was one of Illinois' best in recent memory, being rated within the top 25 nationally by some experts.\n\nZook's recruiting success finally began to pay dividends during the 2007 season. After losing a close game on neutral turf to a Missouri squad which went on to be ranked as high as #1, the Illini ran off five straight wins, including back-to-back home wins over Penn State and Wisconsin. Illinois' 5–1 start gave them a #18 ranking in the AP Poll. This was Illinois' first ranking in the AP Poll since the end of the 2001 season. However, the ranking proved to be short-lived after consecutive losses to Iowa and Michigan. A homecoming win over Ball State gave the Illini bowl eligibility and a blowout win at Minnesota all but assured Zook's first bowl appearance as coach of the Illini. On November 10, the then-unranked Illini defeated #1-ranked Ohio State in Columbus. The Illini finished the 2007 regular season by defeating Northwestern to finish 9–3 overall, 6–2 in the Big Ten. Because Big Ten champion Ohio State played in the BCS National Championship game, Illinois received a bid to play in the Rose Bowl as the second ranked team in the Big Ten. Their improvement of seven wins over the 2006 season was the largest such increase of any Division I team. His success earned Zook a contract extension in October 2007, which paid him approximately $1.5 million through the 2013 season. Zook's success on recruiting trail continued as well, with Illinois having the #17 recruiting class in 2008 according to rivals.com.\n\nOn November 20, 2007, Ron Zook was selected as the Big Ten Coach of the Year. Zook also was awarded the Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year Award following the 2007 season. After making the 2008 Rose Bowl, Illinois was squashed 49–17 by the USC Trojans, putting a damper on an otherwise great season.\n\nExpectations were high for 2008, but Illinois didn't live up to those expectations early on, as they lost to Missouri, 52–42, in their season opener and to Penn State, 38–24. After a 27–20 loss to Minnesota, Illinois crushed Indiana, 55–13. However, the Fighting Illini fell to Wisconsin the very next week; Wisconsin had been winless in Big Ten play prior to that game. While Zook's team was able to upset Iowa 27–24 a week after their loss to Wisconsin, the Illini finished 2008 with a three-game losing streak at the hands of Western Michigan (23–17), Ohio State (30–20), and Northwestern (27–10).\n\nDespite a very disappointing 2008 season, Zook's 2009 Fighting Illini team received AP Poll votes. As they had the previous two years, Illinois started off the season with a loss to Missouri, but this time, the result was far more lopsided than the previous affairs; Missouri won 39–7. Illinois stomped Illinois State 45–17 the next week, but then they suffered an embarrassing 30–0 shutout at the hands of Ohio State. Illinois lost their next four games by ten points or more (including a 27–14 loss to Indiana, the Hoosiers' only Big Ten win of the season), sinking to 1–6 overall. Zook's team then put together a stunning blowout of the Michigan Wolverines in Memorial Stadium, and they followed it up with a 35–32 upset of Minnesota the next week. After back-to-back wins, the Illini fell to the rival Northwestern Wildcats, 21–16. To close out the season, the Fighting Illini put up a fight against Cincinnati, who finished the year undefeated, but were unable to pull off the upset; and they fell at home to Fresno State in a wild 53–52 game in the season finale.\n\nAt the end of the 2009 season, offensive coordinator Mike Schultz was released from his contract, and co-defensive coordinators Dan Disch and Curt Mallory were demoted to position coaches. Illinois hired Paul Petrino as offensive coordinator, and Vic Koenning as defensive coordinator.\n\nAfter back-to-back disappointing years, the Illini had almost no pre-season expectations entering 2010. Juice Williams and Arrelious Benn were no longer on the team. However, running back Mikel Leshoure was, and he proved to be an invaluable asset on offense, while Illinois started freshman Nathan Scheelhaase at quarterback.\n\nThey started off 2010 by losing to Missouri for the fourth consecutive year, 23–13. They held a 13–3 lead that almost lasted the length of the game. After the early loss, Illinois defeated Southern Illinois, 35–3, and Northern Illinois, 28–22. While the Fighting Illini lost to Ohio State in their Big Ten opener, they gave the Buckeyes a scare, knocking out quarterback Terrelle Pryor and holding the Buckeye passing offense almost entirely in check. Illinois then traveled to State College to take on the Nittany Lions, and Illinois had never won in Beaver Stadium prior to 2010. Illinois handed Penn State a stunning 33–13 loss on homecoming.\nThey went on to win the Texas Bowl in a blowout against Baylor.\n\nAs the 2011 season begun, the Illini were picked by most experts to finish near the bottom of the newly formed Leaders Division. However, Illinois got off to one of their best starts in history by winning their first six games. After taking care of Arkansas State, 33–15, and blasting South Dakota State, 56–3, the Fighting Illini won a trio of home games by a margin of a field goal over 22nd-ranked Arizona State (17–14), Western Michigan (23–20), and Northwestern (38–35) in a game in which Illinois rallied from a 28–10 deficit in the second half. After defeating Indiana 41–20 in Illinois' first road game of the season, the Illini were 6–0 for the first time since 1951 and they climbed to 15th in the Coaches' Poll and 16th in the AP Poll. However, the Illini lost 17–7 to Ohio State and the season seemed headed towards a downward spiral as Illinois lost a pair of close road games at Purdue (21–14) and Penn State (10–7). Illinois returned home and lost to Michigan, 31–14. On the Tuesday before the Wisconsin game, Zook opened his weekly press conference by warning the reporters not to ask questions about his job status. When reporter Shannon Ryan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" asked Zook if he had talked to his players about the rumors pertaining to his future, he walked out of the press conference. The Illini went on to lose to Wisconsin, 28–17, and finished the regular season with a 27–7 loss to Minnesota. With the loss to the Golden Gophers, Illinois became the first team in NCAA Division I FBS history to start a season 6–0, and end it at 6–6. Zook was fired on November 27, 2011. His final record at Illinois was 34–51. The Illini did receive a bowl invitation and they defeated UCLA in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl. It was first time in school history that the football team won back-to-back bowl games.\n\nAfter leaving Illinois, Zook spent two seasons out of football, during which time he worked as a college football studio analyst for CBS and took an executive position at a bank in Ocala, Florida.\n\nIn 2014, Zook was hired by the Green Bay Packers to the position of assistant special teams coordinator. He was not retained by the team after the 2018 season.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, Zook joined the Salt Lake Stallions of the Alliance of American Football as special teams coordinator and secondary coach. The league folded during the season.\n\nIn August 2019, Maryland head coach Mike Locksley hired Zook as a senior analyst; Locksley had worked under Zook at Illinois as his offensive coordinator and at Florida as running backs coach and recruiting coordinator.\n\n\n"}

In 2007 Doig won the University of Colorado's Center of the American West's Wallace Stegner Award. Doig's 2006 novel \"The Whistling Season\" became a New York Times best-seller. He won the Western Literature Association's lifetime Distinguished Achievement award and held the distinction of the only living author with works of both fiction and non-fiction listed in the top 12 of the San Francisco Chronicle poll of best books of the 20th century.\n\nIn 2006, Sven Birkerts described Doig as \"a presiding figure in the literature of the American West.\"\n\nDoig was born in White Sulphur Springs, Montana to Charles \"Charlie\" Doig, ranch hand and Bernita Ringer Doig, ranch cook. [spelled Berneta on tombstone, www.findagrave.com] After the death of his mother on his sixth birthday, he was raised by his father and his grandmother Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Ringer. Doig moved with his father and grandmother on a series of jobs, the ranch equivalent of sharecropping, subsequently moving to Dupuyer, Montana to herd sheep close to the Rocky Mountain Front. As a child, Doig read comics, sports pages and magazines like Life, Colliers and The Saturday Evening Post.\n\nDoig graduated salutatorian in a class of 21 students from Valier High School in Valier, Montana. [Class of 1957 per choteauacantha.com e-edition 7-19-2017 page 3] Doig earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in journalism from Northwestern University. His master's thesis was on the subject of televised congressional hearings on organized crime. He later earned a Ph.D. in American history at the University of Washington, writing his dissertation on John J. McGilvra (1827-1903).\n\nImportant first-hand influences on his writing included his high school English and Latin teacher, Frances Tidyman; Sam Jamison, who taught him reporting at Northwestern; and Ben Baldwin, who taught him broadcast news.\n\nDoig lived with his wife Carol Doig, née Muller, a university professor of English, in Seattle, Washington until his death from multiple myeloma in 2015.\n\nHe was related to Fully Informed Jury Association co-founder, Don Doig.\n\nBefore becoming a novelist, Doig wrote for newspapers and magazines as a free-lancer and worked for the United States Forest Service. Doig served as an editorial writer for the Lindsay-Schaub newspaper chain in Decatur, Illinois, and served as assistant editor of \"The Rotarian\" magazine in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nThe western landscape and people play an important role in Doig's fiction, with much of it set in the Montana country of his youth. His major theme is family life in the past, mixing personal memory and regional history. The first three Montana novels—\"English Creek\", \"Dancing at the Rascal Fair\", and \"Ride with Me, Mariah Montana\", form the \"McCaskill trilogy\", covering the first century of Montana statehood from 1889 to 1989.\n\nIn October 2015, Carol Doig donated her husband's extensive holding of notes, photos and records of his writing to the Montana State University Library Merrill G.

The treaty covers the\n\nCanada, as a dominion of the Crown of Britain at the time, subsequently enacted the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act to implement the treaty.\n\nMomentum for a boundary waters treaty built up against a background of difficulties encountered in apportioning the waters of the St. Mary and Milk Rivers in the west, the Rainy River, the Chicago Diversion of Lake Michigan (which at the time lowered lake levels by 6 inches), the St. Mary's River at Sault Ste. Marie, and the Niagara River. Thus at the International Irrigation Congresses in Denver, Colorado, in 1894 and in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1895, resolutions were introduced by the Canadian delegate and adopted unanimously by the United States, Mexican, and Canadian delegations. The resolution recommended to the United States \"the appointment of an international commission to act in conjunction with the authorities of Mexico and Canada in adjudicating the conflicting rights which have arisen, or may hereafter arise, on streams of an international character.\" In 1896, the Canadian Government requested that the British Ambassador at Washington inform the United States Government that it was prepared to cooperate \"by appointment of an international commission or otherwise\" in the regulation of international streams for irrigation purposes.\n\nThe Boundary Waters Treaty, completed on January 11, 1909, was approved for ratification by a supermajority (two-thirds) of the United States Senate on March 3, 1909. President William Taft ratified the treaty on May 13, 1910. King Edward VII ratified Canada's corollary International Boundary Waters Treaty Act.\n\nThe Treaty's framework prevents and resolves disputes over boundary waters. It defines boundary waters as surface waters along the international border, mostly in whole, excluding upstream tributaries (Preliminary Article). It establishes free use of boundary waters for commerce and navigation forever (Article I). It grants respective federal and state/provincial governments legal jurisdiction over the use, obstruction, and diversion of these waters (Article II). It creates the International Joint Commission (IJC) and requires future hydromodifications be approved by a majority of the three Canadian and three U.S. Commissioners (Articles III, IV, VII, VIII). The IJC can only provide research or orders of approval if either federal government submits a referral (Article IX).\n\nThe IJC has jurisdiction for regulating water quantity, including flows and levels, the Treaty enumerates the following order of precedence of use (Article VIII):\nThe Treaty applies the riparian doctrine that one use cannot materially impair another protected use. Therefore, many issues of water quality are also within the IJC's purview.\n\n\n"}

It is wholly owned by Transamerica, a subsidiary of Aegon.\n\nWorld Financial Group associates are compensated by selling financial services products and receiving commission overrides from people that agents sponsor into the company.\n\nWorld Marketing Alliance (WMA) was founded by Hubert Humphrey after he left Primerica in 1991. The original name was Alexander, Inc. but shortly thereafter was renamed World Marketing Alliance. The original idea was that the baby boomers needed a solution for wealth creation and tax protection, and that the \"buy term and invest the difference\" philosophy of Primerica (formerly A.L. Williams) could be better addressed with variable universal life insurance.\n\nWhile in A.L., Humphrey created and introduced the Business Format System (BFS), a business sales and recruiting methodology. Humphrey continued to develop the methodology in WMA. MD TV, the company's private satellite television network, was also introduced during this period. The company expanded its operations to Canada, Taiwan, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. The company held its first convention in Las Vegas in 1992. It was attended by about 2,000 associates.\n\nOn March 23, 1998, WMA Executive World Headquarters opened in Duluth, Georgia. The building housed 500+ employees.\n\nIn November 1998, WMA was fined $100,000 \"for not properly supervising its sales agents\" after their clients lost nearly $2 million in unregistered investments. In 2000, WMA was fined $125,000 \"for failing to report nearly 900 customer complaints\".\n\nIn June 2001, select assets of WMA were purchased by AEGON and renamed World Financial Group, Inc. Humphrey retained WMA Mortgage Services, Inc. and the original logo, which was used in his subsequent companies World Leadership Group and Hegemon Group International. As part of the conditions of sale, Humphrey was placed on a noncompete agreement and could not compete in the insurance industry until 2013. Following the sale of WMA to Aegon, Alexander Wynaendts, chief executive of AEGON, was quoted as saying, \"When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures\".\n\nWorld Financial Group has over 3,500 offices in the United States. The World Financial Group Canadian division, World Financial Group Insurance Agency of Canada Inc., moved to Toronto, Ontario in February 2012. In 2008, World Financial Group had over 80 Canadian offices and over 1,500 agents.

It is yet unclear how successfully the company has managed to distance itself from its more controversial U.S.-based predecessor WMA, associated with fraud, misrepresentation and false statements, and the subject of class action lawsuits, and National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) disciplinary action. In preparation for Aegon's acquisition in 2001, \"World Marketing Alliance 'ramped up' compliance before the acquisition\". Aegon's Chief Executive Officer Alexander Wynaendts said on Bloomberg TV that \"When we took the company over, we put in place very strict regulatory and compliance procedures. Of course, when you have such large numbers of people out there in the field, it is quite an effort. We feel comfortable that we now have the regulatory issues under control.\"\n"}

Its western terminus is at the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The route goes in a straight line for most of its length, and intersects Interstate 49 (I-49) and U.S. Route 71 (US 71). Its eastern terminus is at US 160 and Route 37 in Golden City. The route was designated in 1942, and formerly consisted of two supplemental routes.\n\nRoute 126 starts at the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The road travels east for around seven miles in a straight line, intersecting Route M and Route 43. Route 126 continues eastward, crossing through farmland and a few trees. After the route intersects Route J, it meets a frontage road parallel to I-49/US 71. The road crosses over North Fork Spring River and continues east. Soon, Route 126 intersects I-49/US 71 at a diamond interchange, and intersects a frontage road again. The route crosses a railroad owned by Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, and intersects Routes JJ and T. Four miles later, the route enters Golden City and becomes Main Street. It becomes concurrent with Route 37. The routes goes through downtown Golden City, and turn slightly northeast. The two routes end at US 160 at a T-intersection. US 160 continues eastward toward Lockwood. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 840 vehicles traveling east of I-49/US 71, and as few as 480 vehicles traveling west of I-49/US 71. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.\n\nThe road that became Route 126 was built and designated, as supplemental Route D around 1935. It connected from US 71 to US 160 in Golden City. By 1940, supplemental Route H was designated, connected from Route 43, to a dead end east of it. A year later, Route H was extended west to the Kansas state line. In 1942, Route 126 was designated, replacing Route H from the state line to Route 43. Around 1945-1949, Route H was extended east to Route Z, and the same route was extended east for a few miles east of Route Z in 1954. Around 1955, Route H and D were removed in the supplemental route system, and was replaced by Route 126, as the two sections became connected. Later, Route 126 was repaved in concrete, from the state line to Route 43. The whole route was repaved by 1957. In 1979, US 71 was moved to a freeway alignment, but an interchange wasn't built until 2010-2013. I-49 became co-signed with US 71 in December 2012.\n"}

Though Dennis's work is less well known today, his 1915 publication of \"The Sentimental Bloke\" sold 65,000 copies in its first year, and by 1917 he was the most prosperous poet in Australian history.\n\nTogether with Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson, both of whom he had collaborated with, he is often considered among Australia's three most famous poets. \n\nWhile attributed to Lawson by 1911, Dennis later claimed he himself was the 'laureate of the larrikin'. When he died at the age of 61, the Prime Minister of Australia Joseph Lyons suggested he was destined to be remembered as the 'Australian Robert Burns'.\n\nC. J.

XCR is a multi-caliber, gas piston weapon system developed by Robinson Armament Co. for U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to satisfy the requirements of the SOF Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR competition, but was disqualified on a technicality due to late delivery of blank firing adapters. Robinson Armament continued development and the XCR is now being offered to law enforcement, the military and general public. Deliveries of the rifle began in mid-2006. The XCR was displayed to U.S. Army officials during an invitation-only Industry Day on November 13, 2008. The goal of the Industry Day was to review current carbine technology prior to writing formal requirements for a future replacement for the M4 Carbine.\n\nThe XCR utilizes a heavy duty bolt and extractor connected to a long stroke type gas piston. The bolt and extractor are designed and patented by Robinson Arms, and promoted as offering higher performance over eight lug M16/M4 type bolts. Other features include a folding stock which eases storage space consumption and deploying from a vehicle, in addition to telescoping M4 Carbine style stocks for those who prefer length of pull adjustments; it also has a monolithic top Picatinny rail with side and under-barrel rails, and forward assist integrated into left-side charging handle.\n\nThe XCR is a multi-caliber weapon system. The base rifle is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO. Conversions to other calibers and barrel lengths can be performed in 2 to 3 minutes without the need of a trained armorer, and using only a standard hex wrench, and consist of changing to the appropriately chambered barrel and bolt, replacing brass deflector (optional) and insertion of appropriate magazine. .300 AAC Blackout, 6.8mm Remington SPC, and 7.62×39mm are the current conversion kits available. 6.5mm Grendel was slated for release in 2009, but is currently on hold due to technical issues. The barrel retention design of the XCR is seen as a weak point to the design (when compared to the design of the Magpul Masada / Bushmaster ACR in particular), as the retention bolt can back out slightly, potentially causing POI shift and function issues. \n\nIn addition to conversion kits, complete factory guns in the alternate calibers are also sold.\n\nThe XCR employs a Kalashnikov type, gas operated action with the bolt carrier attached to a long-stroke gas piston; the gas chamber is located above the barrel.\n\nThe proprietary bolt is a three-lug design that locks onto the barrel extension leaving the upper receiver unstressed. There is no need to check the headspace when changing barrels. A steel fixed ejector is attached to the inside of the receiver, held in place by two bolts. The manufacturer claims this design provides stronger ejection than what is offered on the AR-15’s spring-loaded ejector design. The ejection pattern is to the two o'clock position of the operator, with an optimum distance of 15 ft to 20 ft depending on ammunition type and gas setting.\n\nMagazines are STANAG 4179 type.\n\nThe upper receiver is made from anodized aluminum forgings, and is non-stressed. It features a non-reciprocating charging handle on left side which also acts as a forward assist.\n\nThe quad rail system is integrated into the upper receiver and compatible with most 1913 Picatinny devices. The top rail is monolithic and 17” long, providing a rigid, uninterrupted plane for mounting optics and BUIS (Backup Iron Sights); the 3, 6, and 9 O'clock Position Rails are 8\" long.\n\nThe XCR was designed in 2004 by Alex J. Robinson of Robinson Armament Co. Production of the XCR-L variant of the rifle began in mid-2006.\n\nThe XCR-L is currently available in 5.56×45mm NATO, 6.8mm Remington SPC and 7.62×39mm calibers. Each of these calibers is available in kit form for converting an existing rifle to one of the other calibers.\n\nThe XCR-M .308 was officially confirmed via Robinson Arms email circulation to a public reveal at SHOT show 2011.\nThe 6.8mm Remington SPC variant began shipping in November 2007.\n\nThe 7.62×39mm rifles and conversion kits began shipping in July 2008.\n\nIn August 2009 Robinson Arms began shipping 3 different sized upper receivers enabling PDW and pistol style variants:\n\nVariants are also available in \"California\" versions which are limited to meet the more restrictive State of California firearms laws.\n\nRobinson Armament also produces an 18.6\" barrel version for the Canadian market, which makes the XCR \"Non-Restricted\" which increases its Canadian Market as it is available to holders of the standard Possession and Acquisition License (PAL) without a restricted firearm status, needed to purchase handguns and rifles like the AR-15. The XCR rifles intended for the Canadian market are shipped with the FAST stock (fully adjustable stock) although aftermarket stocks are available as an accessory. Also these rifles ship with a single magazine pinned to accept only five rounds.\n\nSince its introduction in 2006, components of the XCR have been updated. Most of these enhancements are available to existing XCR owners.\n\n\n\n"}

Route 291 serves as a main arterial road and commercial strip in Liberty and Independence.\n\nRoute 291 begins in central Cass County at an interchange with I-49/US 71 in Harrisonville. Here, the roadway continues as Cantrell Road. It travels to the north, intersecting Route P (203rd Street), and past Country Creek Golf Club. It has a brief concurrency with Route 58. The two routes separate after just over . Route 291 is a major highway in eastern Jackson County. In Lee's Summit, it has an interchange with Route 150. After it passes Shamrock Hills Golf Course, it has a very brief concurrency with US 50. After the two highways separate, Route 291 travels through the main part of the city and has an interchange with I-470. The two highways begin a concurrency for the remainder of I-470's length. They have an interchange with Strother Road and then meet Woods Chapel Road. Then, they have an interchange with Lakewood Boulevard and Bowlin Road. Here, they pass to the east of Lakewood Oaks Golf Club. After crossing over the Little Blue River and entering Independence, they have an interchange with US 40 (Cpl M.E. Webster Memorial Parkway). Shortly afterward is an interchange with I-70, where I-470 meets its eastern terminus. Route 291 continues to the north. It has an interchange with 39th Street. It crosses over a Kansas City Southern Railway line on the southeastern corner of Van Hook Park. After a more westerly jog, it intersects Route 78 (East 23rd Street South). Immediately after crossing over a Union Pacific Railroad line is an interchange with Truman Road. Farther along is an interchange with US 24. Route 291 passes to the west of Winterstone Golf Course and travels to the north-northwest. It crosses over Mill Creek. It then crosses over a Union Pacific Railroad line just to the west of the River Bluff Nature Preserve. The highway then crosses over the Missouri River on the Liberty Bend Bridge. On the northern shore of the river, it enters River Bend. In town is an interchange with Route 210. The highway enters Clay County and Liberty. Route 291 curves to the west and then to the northwest. It intersects the eastern terminus of Route 152 (West Kansas Street). It curves to the north and parallels I-35/US 69 before curving back to the northwest and meeting those routes at an interchange. Almost immediately is an intersection with the southern terminus of Route A (Church Road). Route 291 curves to the west and has an interchange with I-435, where it ends.\n\nThe route was renumbered in the mid-1960s when I-29 was opened.\n\nIt originally crossed the Missouri River about north of where it does now, until 1949, when the Missouri River was rerouted. The county line stayed constant, however, leaving some of Jackson County north of the river. It was aligned on what is now the western frontage road in southern Liberty, Southview Drive, until the mid-1970s, when a four-lane Route 291 was built.\n\nRoute 291 was designated as \"Route 35\" from 1926 to 1939, and then \"US 71 Bypass\" until 1972. From 1922 to 1926, Route 35 took the western route between Harrisonville and Kansas City, while Route 1 followed present Route 291; US 71 replaced that part of Route 1 in 1926, but followed what had been Route 35, and so Route 35 was moved east to replace the piece of Route 1 bypassed by US 71.\n"}

Population details taken at the 2011 census can be found under Colwich.\n\nHaywood lies on the River Trent, where the Trent is met by its tributary, the River Sow. The village is also the site of a significant junction of the English inland canal network, Haywood Junction, where the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal meets the Trent and Mersey Canal. The waters around the village are widely regarded by guidebooks as some of the most attractive on the network.\n\nThere are two churches, each of which has an attached school. St. John's RC School was classed as 'Good' in their most recent Ofsted inspection, and Anson CE School was deemed to be 'Outstanding' in December 2011.\n\nSt. Stephen's Church was designed by Thomas Trubshaw, and became the centre of a parish in 1854. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Earl of Lichfield and other members of the Anson family of Shugborough Hall are buried in the churchyard of St Stephen's.\n\nSt. John the Baptist's Catholic church was originally built in Tixall, about away, as a private chapel to Tixall Hall, which was owned by the Aston family. When the estate was sold to Earl Talbot, the church was dismantled and rebuilt with a few alterations in Great Haywood. The marks made on the blocks to allow reassembly can still be seen inside the church.\n\nThere was originally a mill and a brewery in the village, but both have been closed down and demolished, commemorated by the names of the roads where they once stood (Mill Lane and Brewery Lane). Following a fatal automobile accident in 1905, the mill pond was drained and the road straightened.\n\nSamuel Peploe Wood (1827–1873) was an English sculptor and painter who was born in the village. He undertook work on many Staffordshire buildings, including the reredos at All Angels' Church, Colwich; corbels and bosses at St. Stephen's Church, Great Haywood and an oak lectern for Stowe by Lichfield.\n\nThe Stone to Colwich railway line passes through Great Haywood, and the village was served by a railway station which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 6 June 1887 and closed in 1957.\n\nIn August 2002 advertisements were placed in the national press for a \"hermit\" to take up residence on the Great Haywood Cliffs above the nearby Shugborough estate, ancestral home of Lord Lichfield. Fifty-five people applied, and Ansuman Biswas was chosen as hermit. Shugborough also serves as the headquarters of Staffordshire's arts management team.\n\nThe village was home to the newly married Edith Tolkien, wife of famous author J. R. R. Tolkien, from March 1916 to February 1917. She moved to the village to be close to his camp on Cannock Chase. J. R. R. Tolkien himself lived in Great Haywood in the winter of 1916-17.\n\nGreat Haywood is the site of Essex Bridge, one of the largest surviving packhorse bridges in the country which stands over the River Trent near Shugborough Hall. It borders Cannock Chase, designated an area of outstanding natural beauty since 1958.\n\n"}

He was the eldest of three children of James J. Lenox-Conyngham Clark and Marion Caroline Dehra, née Chichester. His brother was James Chichester-Clark, who became Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and his sister was Penelope Hobhouse, the garden writer and historian. In 1924 James Clark, Snr. changed the family name to \"Chichester-Clark\" by deed poll, thus preventing the old ascendancy name Chichester (his wife's maiden name) from dying out. On his mother's side the family are descended from the Donegall Chichesters and were the heirs of the Dawsons of Castledawson, who had originally held Moyola Park.\n\nHe was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth and Magdalene College, Cambridge. He began work as a journalist in 1949, worked as public relations officer for Glyndebourne 1952–3, before joining the publishing house Oxford University Press.\n\nChichester-Clark was elected for Londonderry at the 1955 general election. He was the third generation of politicians from his family. His grandfather represented Londonderry at Westminster; his grandmother and father were members of the Northern Ireland parliament. His brother James Chichester-Clark was Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1971, but resigned in the face of increasing violence and internal Ulster Unionist Party splits. The family were also active in politics in the 19th century and Chichester-Clark's great great grandfather, The Rt. Hon. George Robert Dawson was Member of Parliament for Londonderry, later for an English constituency, before joining the Government of Sir Robert Peel whose sister Mary he married. They lived at Castledawson.\n\nChichester-Clark was consistently either a Front Bench Spokesman for the Opposition or a member of the Government of Harold Macmillan and, later, Edward Heath. He held the position of Assistant Government Whip, Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, Comptroller of the Household, was Conservative Spokesman for Northern Ireland and on the Arts, Shadow Minister of Public Building and Works and, ultimately, Minister of State for Employment. In 1970 he remained outside the UK government because of the Premiership of his brother in Northern Ireland. When Edward Heath suspended the Stormont Government and Parliament in 1972, he asked Chichester-Clark to go with William Whitelaw to Northern Ireland as Minister of State. Chichester-Clark did not accept but later joined the administration as Minister of State for Employment. Before the first 1974 Election he announced his retirement from the Londonderry constituency and did not put himself forward for reselection.\n\nSince 1974 he has worked as a director of companies in the construction industry, as a political adviser to the NFBTE, as a management consultant and as Chairman of the medical research charity RAFT (www.raft.ac.uk) and The Arvon Foundation. He has also helped with fundraising for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and is now involved with the development of the Museum of Illustration. Chichester-Clark was interviewed in 2012 and 2014 as part of The History of Parliament's oral history project.\n\nHe was first married to Jane Helen Goddard, daughter of Air Marshall Sir Robert Victor Goddard, KCB, CB. With Jane Goddard he had three children, Emma, Mark and Sophia. His second wife was the barrister Caroline Bull, daughter of the transport executive Anthony Bull.

The island is a part of Nenets Autonomous Okrug of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia.\n\nVaygach Island is mainly formed of argillaceous slates, sandstone, and limestone. There are many rivers about in length, swamps, and small lakes on the island. For the most part it consists of tundra. Slight rocky ridges run generally along its length, and the coast has low cliffs in places. The island consists mostly of limestone, and its elevation above the sea is geologically recent. Raised beaches are frequent. The rocks are heavily scored by ice, but this was probably marine ice, not that of glaciers. The only settlement on the island is Varnek.\n\nGrasses, mosses and Arctic flowering plants are abundant, but there are no trees excepting occasional dwarf willows. Foxes and lemmings are spotted occasionally. While there are not many land animals on the island, birds are very numerous; a variety of ducks, waders etc. frequent the marshes and lakes. At least five polar bears are known to inhabit the island.\n\nIn 2007, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Russian government approved a nature reserve on Vaygach island. The island's surrounding seas are home to many marine mammals such as walruses, seals and endangered whales.\n\nThe name of the island translates from the Nenets as \"alluvial shore\", or by another account Vaygach means ‘terrible death’ or ‘territory of death’ in the local language.\n\nUntil the 19th century, the island was an important shrine of the Nenets people.

{"id": "2277021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277021", "title": "Forest tent caterpillar moth", "text": "Forest tent caterpillar moth\n\nThe forest tent caterpillar moth (\"Malacosoma disstria\") is a moth found throughout North America, especially in the eastern regions. Unlike related tent caterpillar species, the larvae of forest tent caterpillars do not make tents, but rather, weave a silky sheet where they lie together during molting. They also lay down strands of silk as they move over branches and travel as groups along these pheromone-containing silk trails. The caterpillars are social, traveling together to feed and massing as a group at rest. Group behavior diminishes as the caterpillars increase in size, so that by the fifth instar (molt) the caterpillars are feeding and resting independently.\n\nThe adult moths of this species favor oak, sweetgum, tupelo, aspen, and sugar maple for egg laying in the summer. The females lay eggs in masses of up to 300, which are stuck to twigs and covered with a gluey cement called spumaline, which prevents them from desiccating and freezing. Eggs hatch the following spring. The larvae can be found feeding on many other species of deciduous trees or shrubs. High population density outbreaks tend to recur at reasonably regular intervals every decade or so and usually last two to three years, during which time trees and shrubs can be almost completely denuded of leaves. Most plants replace the lost leaves without permanent damage.\n\nMature (pre-pupating) larvae are 2 to 2.5 inches (50 to 64 mm) in length. The caterpillars are black, dark brown, or gray, with broad blue longitudinal stripes and thin yellow stripes extending along each side. The back of each abdominal segment bears a white spot that is wider toward the head end. The sides are partially covered with fur-like long setae. The adult moth that emerges after pupation is yellow or tan with a thick, short, furry body. The wingspan is about 1.5 inches (30 mm). Coloration is similar for males and females. The female's body is larger than the male's.\n\nThe forest tent caterpillar moth is nocturnal, taking flight soon after nightfall and returning to rest before dawn. It is not known how far an egg-laden female can fly, but there is one credible report of this species flying hundreds of kilometers with the assistance of an unusually strong wind.\n\nThe social caterpillars of \"Malacosoma disstria\" are nomadic and forage as a group. The fifty to two hundred larvae that result from a single egg-mass live together for most of their larval stages. Trails of silk heavily loaded with pheromones secreted by other colony members induce larvae to move, while the close presence of other colony members brings them to quiescence. This indicates that there are social cues that are used to increase the locomotive efficiency of each individual larva. Pupation occurs after caterpillars reach a size threshold that is attained more quickly when caterpillars forage in groups. This is particularly important since delayed development to threshold increases the risks of predation and food depletion. However, as larvae proceed into the later instars, they become increasingly independent and by the fifth instar rarely form aggregations. This ontogenetic change in gregariousness results from an increase in the costs of maintaining grouping due to changes related to predation, thermoregulation, silk production, and foraging.\n\nForest tent caterpillars are ectotherms so they rely on sources of heat from the environment to raise their body temperatures. In order to do this, they bask together and benefit from group thermoregulation. Elevating body temperature is essential in increasing metabolic rates for movement and food processing, so proper thermoregulation leads to an increased rate of development. This is very important for \"M. distria\" caterpillars, which rely on fast growth in spite of low environmental temperatures to benefit from the high food quality and the smaller predation risk in the spring. Thus, it is an adaptive advantage to bask in groups. However, as caterpillars grow, thermoregulatory needs decrease and the benefit of group living is gradually overridden by other factors such as food competition.\n\nEating times are variable. Foraging trips can occur at any time and are very coordinated: either the entire colony forages or no one does. A small proportion of starved individuals is enough to reach agreement and start group movement. However, this organized behavior and the high fidelity of caterpillars to pheromone hormone trails imply conservative foraging, which may trap caterpillars to poor food sources even if a better one is close by. Some plasticity in this behavior has been reported, which is modulated by the presence of caterpillars that are behaviorally more exploratory or that simply become more adventurous because they are starved, increasing foraging flexibility. With age, competition for food becomes more important, especially as resources become scarce. Grouping decreases growth rate via a decrease in food intake so ontogenetic changes toward more mobility and independence can be viewed as simple \"scaling\" relationships between caterpillars and food sources evolved to increase the benefits of individual foraging in later stages.\n\nLarge silk trails help increase adhesion to the host plant. As caterpillars advance in groups, they form thick mats of silk that provide them with secure adhesion. Isolated caterpillars have been observed to fall off their host trees and perish. It has been hypothesized that this is due to the production of thin strands that do not provide a secure grip or due to a faster exhaustion of silk supply. In addition to this, making silk is more costly for larvae in their first instars, so grouping is beneficial in earlier stages. As caterpillars develop, they decrease the use of shared silk.\n\nThe first adults to eclose (emerge from their pupa) in early spring are the males. Starting at around 5:30 p.m., hundreds of males fly vigorously and relentlessly in search for cocoons containing females about to eclose. They approach trees and move around them, zigzagging and crawling on branches. If they do not find females with whom they will have the chance to copulate, they fly off and continue their search. It has been suggested that male activity is dependent on temperature, since below 59 ˚F (15 ˚C) only a small number of males are found to be actively looking for females. It has also been reported that females emit a calling pheromone before they emerge from the pupae, causing an increase in male activity around the cocoon before they eclose. In addition, males have been seen approaching and moving around brown objects, suggesting that males also use visual cues to find females. Within one or two seconds after the tip of the female abdomen clears the cocoon, males begin copulation, which lasts an average of 202 minutes. In order to position himself, the male moves backwards and bends his abdomen towards the female, pushing the tip towards the female's bursa copulatrix. There is a significant positive correlation between the body sizes of copulating pairs, which indicates that mating is not random with respect to size, presumably because of male-male competition for larger females.\nIndependently of whether they are or not copulating, females do not move more than a few centimeters from their eclosion site until they are able to fly away, usually at twilight. Females start preparing for flight by fanning their wings. Frequently, fanning begins during mating and is often the first sign of its end as females fly away soon after.\n\nForest tent caterpillar populations increase periodically to outbreak densities. Not much is known about the factors that lead to the initiation of forest tent caterpillar outbreaks, although some plausible mechanisms are higher temperatures in the spring, phenological synchrony with their host plants, and reduced predation enemies. Whatever the cause, outbreak densities give rise to cyclic population dynamics, characterized by highest fecundity at peak population density and reduced fecundity for several generations during decline.\nAt low population densities, moths are found mating high above the ground, in the forest canopy. Mating starts late in the day and copulations are short. In contrast, during high-density outbreaks, mating takes place on lower vegetation, presumably because caterpillars descend to forage in less defoliated areas, where they form their pupae. This high population density increases the operational sex ratio and significantly intensifies male-male competition. As a result, copulations begin earlier in the day and last longer in an attempt to minimize sperm competition. In addition, such high densities enhance female opportunities for being selective regarding males.\n\nDuring high outbreak densities, some males, called \"hangers\", change their copulation behavior. They do not attach physically to the branch while mating, which allows them to mate longer and counteract their mate's efforts to reject them. This behavior increases the percentage of eggs they fertilize as they delay their mated female from remating and reduce number of potential mates the female can have. This hanging behavior does not appear at low population densities, presumably because it is more energetically costly and more conspicuous, since it can attract more males that can potentially interfere in the copulation process. As a result, males only exhibit this behavior when they are trying to prolong mating to reduce sperm competition.\n\nFemales begin ovipositing the day after copulation and do so in one batch during a single oviposition event. Shorter and longer oviposition durations are associated with smaller and larger egg masses, which are directly related to female size. Just before beginning to oviposit, females exhibit dispersal behavior. They position themselves on a branch, spread their wings, and extend their abdominal tip around the branch to prepare for oviposition. As they oviposit, they move around the branch aligning the eggs, forming a ring-like structure around the branch. They then cover their eggs with a foamy substance known as spumaline. It has been hypothesized that the spumaline cover protects eggs from predation and parasitism. Offspring pass the winter inside their eggs. Although cold tolerant, they are susceptible to freezing in extreme cold temperatures, with the risk of mortality varying seasonally with changes in temperature and physiology. Not much is known about parental effects on offspring survival during the winter. The only source of energy for overwintering forest tent caterpillar eggs comes from the parental generation. As a result, overwintering performance of the insect should be viewed in the context of parental fitness.\n\nIndividual risk is lower in larger groups due to collective defense from predators, the dilution effect, and the selfish herd theory. All of these effects provide supplementary protection to individuals in the middle of the group. To compensate for group conspicuousness, caterpillars minimize movement, reducing their chances of being located by invertebrate predators. This behavior has associated costs because it decreases individual caterpillars’ selectiveness regarding food sources, as they will not be able to work to get better food sources. Ontogenetic changes in caterpillars reduce the risk of predation and as a consequence, predation-related benefits of group foraging decrease with time. Moreover, grouping in later instars has the extra cost of an increased risk of pathogen transmission.\n\nThe caterpillars are considered a problem when the larva population explodes in the spring. They can completely consume the foliage of a tree. Trees usually recover from this, refoliating within a month and resuming photosynthesis. Under most circumstances, little lasting damage is caused to the trees; however, the disappearance of foliage is considered to be an unattractive nuisance. On those rare occasions when infestations last for three years or more, tree mortality rates can become significant. Multiple outbreaks in Northern Ontario, Canada, in the 1990s resulted in over six consecutive years of aspen defoliation in some areas. One outbreak in upstate New York and Vermont began in 2002, with 650,000 acres (2600 km²) defoliated in New York and 230,000 acres (930 km²) in Vermont by 2005.\n\nForest tent caterpillar outbreaks tend to recur at reasonably regular intervals every decade or so, with the precise interval varying somewhat in time and space. Outbreaks usually last two to four years. Although the insect's distributional range is quite large, the area over which decadal outbreak cycles are synchronized (i.e. oscillating with the same phase) varies substantially. Outbreak cycles are more strongly synchronized in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Where spatially separated populations are phase-synchronized, the synchronization is thought to be due to the process of entrainment, that is, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment.\n\nThe cause of the outbreak cycle is not known with certainty. There are a large number of natural mortality agents which could be responsible for population cycling, including parasitoids, predators, starvation, disease, and severe weather. Most infestations subside after one or two years as a result of a combination of these factors. The most common parasitoids associated with population decline are flies of the families Tachinidae and Sarcophagidae.\n\n"}

The station's transmitter is located near South Gettysburg Avenue in the Highview Hills neighborhood in southwest Dayton. Its signal is relayed by translator station W32DS-D in Maplewood, Ohio.\nWPTD has a sister station, WPTO, virtual channel 14 (UHF digital channel 29), also a PBS member. Licensed to Oxford, WPTO is a secondary PBS station for the Cincinnati market, alongside that city's primary PBS outlet, WCET (channel 48). WPTO's transmitter is located in the Clifton Heights neighborhood of downtown Cincinnati.\n\nTogether, WPTD and WPTO are known as the ThinkTV Network (stylized as Think): WPTD is ThinkTV 16, and WPTO is ThinkTV 14. Despite shared branding, WPTO is not a satellite of WPTD; the two stations are separately programmed, with almost no overlap, except during pledge drives. ThinkTV is a subsidiary of Public Media Connect, a regional non-profit company, which also owns WCET. Master control and internal operations for all three stations are at ThinkTV's facility on South Jefferson Street in downtown Dayton.\n\nWPTD's broadcast coverage includes much of southwestern Ohio, including Dayton and Cincinnati, and parts of eastern Indiana. Most of WPTO's coverage area, which is smaller, overlaps WPTD's; WPTO's is concentrated in the extreme southwest corner of Ohio, providing a stronger signal to Cincinnati than to Dayton. Both stations are available on Charter Communications' cable television service throughout southwestern Ohio, though some providers may offer only WPTD's digital subchannels or WPTO's, depending on their location.\n\nWPTD first signed on the air on April 24, 1972 as WOET-TV (standing for \"Ohio Educational Television\"); it was operated by the Ohio Educational Broadcasting Network Commission (OEB). Prior to the station's launch, the channel 16 frequency in Dayton was occupied by a commercial independent and sometime ABC-affiliated station, WKTR-TV. That station was owned by Kitty Hawk Television Corporation and licensed to Kettering when it began broadcasting in April 1967. It went dark February 27, 1971, but returned to the air with a limited schedule from April until October while the license transfer to OEB was pending Federal Communications Commission approval. The FCC formally reallocated the frequency as non-commercial September 14, 1977.\n\nWPTO began broadcasting on October 14, 1959 as WMUB-TV, operated by Miami University. The call letters matched those of then co-owned WMUB radio, and stood for \"Miami University Broadcasting\". It was the secondary educational station in the Cincinnati area, alongside future sister WCET.\n\nThe two stations joined forces in 1975 under the banner of University Regional Broadcasting, a consortium of Miami, Wright State and Central State universities. WMUB-TV served as the primary station for a year, until WOET-TV became the primary station in 1976. In 1977, the stations were transferred to a new community organization, Greater Dayton Public Television, and received their current callsigns, with WOET-TV becoming WPTD and WMUB-TV becoming WPTO.\n\nFrom the creation of University Regional Broadcasting onward, the secondary station operated as a semi-satellite of the primary station, only rarely airing different, usually local public affairs-type, programs. This situation existed until cable television began to become widely available in Cincinnati and Dayton. As cable availability rose, Greater Dayton Public Television began to differentiate its stations' programming gradually, with the stations eventually becoming separately programmed.\n\nThe stations rebranded themselves as the ThinkTV Network in 1998, though the legal name remained Greater Dayton Public Television.\n\nOn October 31, 2008, Greater Dayton Public Television and the Greater Cincinnati Television Educational Foundation (CET), owner of WCET, announced plans to merge their resources into one non-profit organization serving all of Southwest Ohio, while maintaining separate identities. The merger completed on May 8, 2009 with the formation of Public Media Connect, Inc. Both ThinkTV and CET operate as subsidiaries under the new organization. The merger resulted in the July 2010 transfer of WCET's master control operations to ThinkTV's facilities in Dayton.\n\nThe ThinkTV channels and WCET were off the air (and not available through any other providers) from just after 4 p.m. on July 5 until 11:40 a.m. on July 9, 2019 due to the failure of a multiplexer in the master control power supply at ThinkTV in downtown Dayton.\n\nOn November 15, 2019, per an agreement with Greater Dayton Public Television, WHIO-TV (channel 7), which had suffered a transmitter failure on November 5, requested special temporary authority from the FCC to transmit its main (CBS) subchannel over WPTD's subchannel 16.2, displacing the \"16 Again\" service. On November 18, subchannel 16.2 began broadcasting WHIO-TV programming. On November 21, WHIO-TV repaired its transmitter and normal content was restored to subchannel 16.2.\n\nOn May 1, 2003, ThinkTV marked the beginning of its conversion to digital technology with the introduction of four new digital program services and a digital simulcast channel for WPTD. WPTD originally operated its digital signal on UHF channel 58. One year later in May 2004, ThinkTV entered phase two of its digital conversion with the installation of new digital master control equipment and the introduction of new digital channels for WPTO. WPTO operated its digital signal on UHF channel 28, broadcasting from Cincinnati.\n\nDuring this period, the digital channels were 16.2 (ThinkTV 16 DT), 16.3 (ThinkTV 16 Again), 16.4 (ThinkTV 16 Create), 16.5 (ThinkTV 16 Ohio) and 16.6 (ThinkTV HD) for WPTD; and 14.2 (ThinkTV 14 DT), 14.3 (ThinkTV 14 Prime), 14.4 (ThinkTV 14 Learn, carrying PBS Kids and college telecourses), 14.5 (ThinkTV 14 World) and 14.6 (ThinkTV HD). Neither WPTD nor WPTO had an x.1 subchannel; the x.2 subchannels matched their respective analog channels; also, 16.6 and 14.6 carried identical PBS HD programming, which was distinct from the separate analog programming on WPTD and on WPTO.\n\nOn May 1, 2009, just over one month before full-power television stations in the United States were scheduled to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate, WPTD shut down its analog signal over UHF channel 16 and WPTO shut down its analog signal, broadcasting from Oxford, over UHF channel 14. WPTD's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 58, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 16; WPTO's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28, continuing to broadcast from Cincinnati, using PSIP to display WPTO's virtual channel as 14 on digital television receivers.\n\nOn the same day, the subchannels were realigned. On WPTD: ThinkTV 16 HD on 16.1, ThinkTV 16 Again on 16.2, ThinkTV 16 Create on 16.3, ThinkTV 16 Ohio on 16.4, and ThinkTV 16 DT (a standard-definition simulcast of 16.1) on 16.5. On WPTO: ThinkTV 14 HD on 14.1, ThinkTV 14 Prime on 14.2, ThinkTV 14 Learn on 14.3, ThinkTV 14 World on 14.4, and ThinkTV 14 DT (a standard-definition simulcast of 14.1) on 14.5.\n\nWPTD's digital subchannel 16.3 was changed from ThinkTV 16 Create to ThinkTV 16 Life, carrying similar types of programming, later in 2009.\n\nOn January 16, 2017, both WPTD's digital subchannel 16.5 (ThinkTV 16 DT) and WPTO's digital subchannel 14.3 (ThinkTV 14 Learn) were changed to 24/7 carriage of PBS Kids.\n\nIn September 2017, WPTD's digital subchannel 16.4 was rebranded from ThinkTV 16 Ohio to ThinkTV 16 Ohio/World, with programming added from World.\n\nWPTD moved its digital signal from channel 16 to channel 35, and WPTO moved its digital signal from channel 28 to channel 29, at 10 a.m. on October 18, 2019, as part of the FCC's spectrum reallocation process. WPTO operated at low power from that date until May 1, 2020. In addition, WPTD's Maplewood translator, W32DS-D, is scheduled to move its digital signal from channel 32 to channel 25.\n\nThe digital signals of WPTD and WPTO are both multiplexed:\n\nWhile the \"DT\" designations have appeared on the ThinkTV website and have displayed on-screen via PSIP, they are omitted from ThinkTV's advertising and on-screen \"bugs\".\n\nPer FCC filings, WPTD's translator station W17AA in Celina had authorization in 2009 to flash-cut to digital operations on UHF channel 17, at a tower site near its existing analog tower. However, before this conversion could be completed, W17AA suspended operations on January 5, 2011 due to circumstances beyond Greater Dayton Public Television's control, namely a loss of site. The tower owner, the State of Ohio, has plans to dismantle the tower utilized by W17AA, and in anticipation has disconnected power to the tower site location. As a result, GDPTV was forced to suspend operations on W17AA. On January 14, 2011, GDPTV requested a six-month authorization to maintain silent (off-air) status. GDPTV then began the process of considering its options for modification of the W17AA license to allow for its resumption of service. On July 26, 2011, the FCC accepted GDPTV's surrender for cancellation of W17AA's license.\n\nWPTD's other translator station, W63AH channel 63 in Maplewood, also had authorization in 2009 to switch to digital operations, on channel 32. However, W63AH suspended operations on March 30, 2010, also due to a loss of site, following a change in ownership for the translator station's licensed tower location. On April 5, 2010, GDPTV requested a six-month authorization to maintain silent status. On September 9, 2010, GDPTV was granted authorization to relocate its approved digital broadcast facility to a tower near Celina, with the community of license remaining Maplewood. On January 18, 2011, the station was granted \"license to cover\", allowing it to resume broadcasting. The station now operates digitally on channel 32, as W32DS-D (it officially took the W32DS callsign in May 2009).\n\nW32DS-D covers both Celina and the Maplewood, Ohio, area and operates with a directional antenna towards the southeast.\n\n\n"}

The Freedom sailboats have unstayed rigs, meaning that the mast is freestanding and not supported by the normal set of wires called standing rigging. Garry Hoyt, a champion sailor and noted maverick, created the unstayed rigs to give \"freedom\" from the inefficient sail shapes of traditional sloop rigs as well as to give \"freedom\" from the compression and maintenance issues associated with standing rigging. A known issue with this style of mast, however, is that in rough seas it can break loose, causing a potential holing (pounds through the bottom of the hull). This is commonly due to the tangs that hold it in place failing. The masts are made of carbon fiber and are set well forward on the boat. This means most of the sail area is contained in the mainsail. Jib sails can either be overlapping or self-tending.\n\nGary Hoyt founded Freedom Yachts in 1976 with the Freedom 40. He sold Freedom Yachts to Tillotson-Pearson in 1985 after some slow years. He used naval architects from the Herreshoff design offices for his early designs and in the early 1980s commissioned a 39 feet pilothouse design from Ron Holland. Tillotson-Pearson brought Gary Mull on board as designer for a new series of great sailing, conventional looking boats. David Pedrick designed for the (again) new owners starting in the mid 1990s after Tillotson-Pearson Composites sold the yacht division off.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2277026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277026", "title": "The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye", "text": "The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye\n\nThe Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye is the debut studio album by Marvin Gaye, released in 1961, and the second long-playing album (TM-221) released by Motown. The first was \"Hi... We're The Miracles\" (TM-220). It is most notable as the album that caused the first known struggle of Gaye's turbulent tenure with the label.\n\nBetween his release from the U.S. Air Force in 1957 and signing with Motown Records's Tamla label in 1961, Marvin Gaye was struggling to find his identity in the music business. A long admirer of different forms of music from early rock 'n' roll, blues, jazz and doo-wop, Gaye sought to mix the styles of Nat King Cole, Billy Eckstine, Little Willie John and Jesse Belvin, first getting involved in groups such as the Marquees, which he joined following his honorable discharge from a tenure in the Air Forces, which soon replaced the original members of Harvey Fuqua's group The Moonglows under the moniker, \"Harvey and the New Moonglows\", with Reese Palmer doing most of the leads though Gaye did take some lead vocal parts, including speaking in the intro and ending of the single, \"The Twelve Months of the Year\", and sung all lead in the song, \"Mama Loochie\". Both songs were released on the Chess label in 1959 and during this period the group sung background for notable Chess acts including Chuck Berry on the song \"Almost Grown\", and Etta James' \"Chained to My Rocking Chair\". \n\nAfter living in Chicago for two years and following a tour in Detroit, Fuqua decided to split up the group and take Gaye with him to help get him work in the musically-developing city. Fuqua then signed Gaye to a contract with his Harvey and Tri-Phi Records and also assigned him to work with his then-girlfriend Gwen Gordy's Anna label. Gaye would do drumming work for acts on Tri-Phi and Harvey including, most notably, The Spinners, on their debut hit, \"That's What Girls Are Made For\".\n\nIn December 1960, Gaye introduced himself to Motown CEO Berry Gordy at Motown's annual Christmas party by playing piano and singing \"Mr. Sandman\". Gordy was impressed with Gaye and later began working out a negotiation deal with Fuqua to sign the young singer to Gordy's Motown empire. Fuqua agreed to sell 50% of his interest in Gaye to Gordy, which led to Gordy presenting Gaye with a lucrative deal, which he signed with the following month. Gaye was then assigned to Motown's Tamla label, for which he'd record with for the next 20 years. In the meantime, Gaye met and fell in love with one of Gordy's sisters, Anna Gordy and the couple would begin dating during the spring of 1961, marrying within a year.\n\nShortly after Gaye signed to Tamla, the label and the young singer soon clashed with musical direction. While the label was recording R&B music for teenagers, Marvin, who admired Nat King Cole and Ray Charles, wanted to record more \"adult\" music, including jazz and pop standards. Gaye had noted that Cole and Charles had found bigger success recording more adult music, and after seeing that Charles had had success recording jazz music, rather than just R&B, he felt he could do similar. Gaye, who later admitted that growing up, he was told not to dance, also wanted to \"sit on a stool and croon\" rather than \"shake my ass onstage\" saying that his voice was what people paid attention to and not his dancing. After much push, Gaye finally was allowed to record an album of jazz standards with a compromise that he'd record a couple of songs with an R&B feel. Recording his vocals in a relaxed tone, Gaye also played drums and piano on the album while Berry Gordy oversaw much of the album's production. Anna Gordy was another collaborator, co-writing the R&B song \"Never Let You Go (Sha-Lu-Bop)\" for her boyfriend. The album was recorded over two weeks and was released on June 8, 1961. Before the release of his first single, the Berry Gordy-composed ballad \"Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide\", Gaye added an extra 'e' to his last name, to look \"more professional\".\n\nThe album was not given much attention upon its release. \"Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide\" failed to become a major hit, though it was a regional hit in the Midwest and on the West Coast. The label released two more singles from the album, which featured Gaye still singing in a smooth tenor. His style soon changed to include gospel infections, which helped to bring him success after he released his first hit, \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\", in 1962. Motown Records, at the time of this album's release, was still a fledgling operation, with only The Miracles, The Marvelettes, and Mary Wells as successful acts. Gaye's jazz ambitions continued after the album's release and throughout the 1960s. He recorded three more albums featuring jazz covers, none of which resonated well with audiences used to the singer's grittier R&B work during the sixties.\n\n"}

{"id": "2277047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277047", "title": "Guardian Heroes", "text": "Guardian Heroes\n\nGuardian Heroes is a 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up video game in the vein of \"Final Fight\" or \"Golden Axe\", but with RPG elements. The development team called it a \"fighting RPG\". \"Guardian Heroes\" was developed by Treasure and released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn video game console. A sequel was released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance entitled \"Advance Guardian Heroes\".\n\nThe game allows players to alter the storyline through their actions, such as choosing between a number of branching paths, leading to multiple endings, and killing civilians and enemies, leading to changes in the Karma meter. The music was composed by Hideki Matsutake, a former member of electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Nazo Suzuki. It is considered a cult classic of the beat 'em up genre.\n\nIn addition to story mode, the game includes a versus mode wherein up to six players can compete using any of the main characters (and unlockable monsters, bosses, and civilians) in a timed battle or to the death.\n\nThe players earn experience points during each scene, and between scenes are able to improve and customize their characters with six attributes: Strength (determines physical damage per hit and distance enemies fly when the player hits them), Vitality (determines HP), Intelligence (governs size and strength of spells), Mentality (determines how many MP the player has and how fast MP are recovered), Agility (determines the speed at which characters can do physical and magical attacks) and Luck (modifies damage the player gives and receives, in addition to improving Nicole's selection of spells).\n\nThe game's story mode has multiple paths. The player can choose where they will go and what they do after every level. Different paths lead to different endings, bosses, and levels.\n\nThe battlefield has multiple levels. Initially, the player can only access three planes of battle: a foreplane, a middle plane, and a back plane. These planes can be switched between in set sequence, or at the player's choosing based on which button is pressed. Often, evasive actions can be taken by switching a plane.\n\nA supreme being created the universe to find ultimate warriors to hire as its personal soldiers. A vicious battle was waged between the Earth and Sky Spirits (renamed the Earthblood and the Skyborn in the Xbox 360 Remix). The Sky Spirits bestowed incredible powers upon the humans, effectively making powerful wizards for their own gain. The human wizards joined the effort against the Earth Spirits, banishing them into the darkness. Soon after this was accomplished, the Sky Spirits grew fearful and jealous of the humans, and banished them all into the darkness with the Earth Spirits. Mankind instead opted for a more physical approach to life, and the Time of the Sword began.\n\nOne of the human wizards, Kanon, escapes his imprisonment with the Earth Spirits, and comes back to the surface to get his revenge on the Sky Spirits. There, he brings his case up with the existing khans. Since they do not trust him, he destroys them and replaces their kingdom with a wizard kingdom, with puppet khans to do his will. The former king prophesied, prior to his death, that should his reign and the Time of the Sword be brought to such an end, then the sword would resurface and in turn bring an end to Kanon's reign. As a precaution, Kanon banishes every existing sword in his new kingdom, but he overlooks one particular sword, belonging to a fierce, anonymous warrior who fought to the death during Kanon's takeover. Also, the former princess Serena survives the ordeal, and joins the band of knights to try to bring about Kanon's end from the inside.\n\nAt the game's start, four warriors – Han, Randy (with his pet rabbit, Nando), Nicole and Ginjirou – find the sword of the valiant warrior. Serena arrives to warn them that the knights have learned of their possession of the sword, and are coming to take it back. The four flee their home as it bursts up in flames during the invasion, then escape the town via separate ways, rendezvousing at the graveyard nearby.\n\nThe leader of the Black Knights, Valgar, awaits them there, accompanied by a powerful robotic warrior. They are unable to damage it with normal weapons, and Han resolves to use the new sword against the robot. The sword is struck by lightning, electrocuting Han and causing him to lose his grip on it. The sword then floats over to the burial mound of its original owner, who rises up in zombie form. Enraged, he obliterates Valgar's robot, and attacks Serena. However, the five discover that the warrior obeys any command that they give. They resolve that, with this new ally, the time to begin an attack on Kanon's new kingdom is at hand.\n\nFrom here, the story splits into various paths. Some involve ultimately fighting against the Sky Spirits, Earth Spirits, and/or the supreme being that made the universe, while others wind up with the warriors ultimately defeating Kanon, only to have to defeat Super Zur, or various rogue robotic warriors that he had left behind, led by the nefarious Golden Silver.\n\nAccording to former Treasure designer Tetsuhiko \"Han\" Kikuchi, Fill-in-Cafe's \"\" and Capcom's \"Alien VS. Predator\" arcade game were the main inspirations for \"Guardian Heroes\"' design. When asked why Treasure chose to develop a 2D sprite-based game when video game sales were increasingly dominated by 3D games, and when nearly every other Saturn developer was concentrating strictly on 3D games, a Treasure representative commented, \"Treasure has built up a tremendous knowledge of 2D sprite know how. It's an asset that we wish to continue using. ... No we didn't think it was risky. In fact the risk is in trying to make a new game. There [are] a lot of companies that have tried and failed to make successful 3D games. Besides, 2D and 3D games can exist alongside each other.\"\n\nFor the XBLA release, Tetsuhiko Kikuchi returned to create new artwork and assisted development. When preparing for the project, Treasure discovered all the source code for the Saturn version was stored on DAT cassettes. The company did not have equipment to read the tapes, so they had to borrow equipment from various divisions within Sega to build an environment that could retrieve the source code.\n\nOn May 5, 2011, Sega of America and Sega Europe announced a remastered version of \"Guardian Heroes\" for Xbox Live Arcade for Fall 2011. It was announced on September 6 that the game would be released on October 12.\n\nThe port makes numerous changes to the original. It has been reformatted for 16:9 aspect ratio, expanding the playfield. The game features both original and \"remix\" graphics modes and runs in high definition with a remade user interface in both. The remix mode applies an hqx-like upscaling filter along with a pencil-shade effect to the sprites, implements true alpha blending, applies bilinear filtering to the backgrounds and features redrawn spell effects and character portraits.\n\nPlayers can also choose between original and remix options for the gameplay. Remix mode makes many changes to the game's control and mechanics, but does not impact level design or content. Some of these changes, like the new attacking and dodging controls, air dashing, and air recoveries, were modeled after Treasure's own \"\", a fighting game that likewise features elements of \"Guardian Heroes\". The script for Story Mode has been rewritten and contains updated dialogue as well as changes in name to the Earth and Sky Spirits, who are now known as the Earthblood and the Skyborn, respectively.\n\nThe XBLA release also features online play for the multiplayer modes, and an expanded competitive mode that allows for 12 players instead of six. Arcade Mode, an endless survival gauntlet, is a new addition.\n\nThis version was later made backwards compatible with the Xbox One on November 6, 2016.\n\nThe game was well received. The four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" praised the game's combos, multiple paths, and inclusion of a versus mode. Rad Automatic of \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" also praised the multiple paths through the game, but expressed the most enthusiasm about the high difficulty and the three layers on which the action takes place. He concluded, \"Innovative, challenging, exciting and tough, \"Guardian Heroes\" is a classic in every way.\" \"GamePro\" lambasted the game's long-winded dialogue and graphics, saying that \"these poor, simpering graphics have no place on a next-gen machine. Colorful doesn't always mean clean, and there are plenty of jagged edges, pixelated fighters, and breakup.\" Despite this, the reviewer gave the game a strong recommendation, describing it as the true successor to the \"Streets of Rage\" and \"Golden Axe\" series. He elaborated that \"Guardian Heroes\" retains all the fun of Streets of Rage's beat 'em up action and enhances it with new additions like multihit combos, linking moves, and a branching storyline with multiple endings. Yasuhiro Hunter of \"Maximum\" said that \"Treasure's first attempt at a next gen game combines everything they do best - frantic action and an in-depth storyline with great character design.\" He reported that the action and RPG elements are both easy enough that enthusiasts of either genre would find the game accessible. He also highly praised the game's replay value. A reviewer for \"Next Generation\" had a more mixed reaction than other critics, commenting that \"\"Guardian Heroes\" may be the pinnacle of the [side-scrolling beat-'em-up] genre, but even the best is still a bit on the mindless side.\" He remarked that while the graphics, lack of slowdown, and six-player versus mode would thrill die hard beat-'em-up fans, the average gamer would find the game fun but repetitive and lacking in originality.\n\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" awarded \"Guardian Heroes\" Side-Scrolling Game of the Year, explaining that, \"The different characters, the numerous special and magical attacks, the branching story lines, the Versus Mode and the anime style all combined to make \"Guardian Heroes\" one of the best, most memorable games of '96.\" The following year \"EGM\" ranked it number 66 on their \"100 Best Games of All Time\", saying it had surpassed the founding games of the beat 'em up genre.\n\nRetrospective feedback on the game has continued to be positive. IGN staff writer Levi Buchanan ranked \"Guardian Heroes\" third in his list of the top Sega Saturn games. GamesRadar ranked it as the 5th best Saturn game, stating that \"Treasure's original 1996 release remains a wonderful co-op beat-'em-up experience with impressive presentation and exciting combat\" It was ranked as the 4th top beat 'em up video game of all time by Heavy.com in 2013, while ScrewAttack voted it as the 5th best beat 'em up of all time.\n\n\n"}

The film combined live-action and animation, and features live-action appearances by Leon Schlesinger, writer Michael Maltese, animator Gerry Chiniquy and other Schlesinger Productions staff members. The title comes from the popular 1934 song \"You Oughta Be in Pictures\" by Dana Suesse and Edward Heyman, which plays in the beginning of the film.\n\nIn 2016, it was shortlisted for the 1941 Retro-Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.\n\nDaffy wants to be the top star in the studio. To this end, he persuades Porky to resign from the Schlesinger studios to pursue a career in feature films as Bette Davis' leading man {\"\"Three grand\" a week!\"}. Porky goes to Leon Schlesinger and asks to have his contract torn up. Schlesinger reluctantly agrees, and wishes Porky the best of luck. Once Porky is out of earshot, Schlesinger assures the audience that Porky will be back.\n\nPorky spends the rest of the film trying to get into the lots and sets of an unnamed studio, with little success. After several failures from convincing the security guard (played by Michael Maltese, voiced by Mel Blanc) to let him in, dressing up as Oliver Hardy to gain access, (until the guard realizes the real Hardy already entered the studio) and inadvertently interrupting the shooting of a dance film, he decides to see if Schlesinger will take him back.\n\nHe returns to Schlesinger's office after frantically dodging his cartooned car in and out of live-action Los Angeles traffic, only to see Daffy doing a wild audition to become the new star of Warner Bros. cartoons, openly disparaging Porky. Porky then takes Daffy with him to another room, where he beats Daffy up. After this, he hurriedly runs into Schlesinger's office to beg for his job back. Schlesinger, laughing heartily and saying he knew he would return, reveals that he did not really rip up Porky's contract, and happily tells him to get back to work. Porky gladly thanks him and runs back into the animation paper that he was in when the short started. Daffy, still not quite having learned his lesson after being beaten by Porky, again attempts to persuade Porky to resign and work with Greta Garbo, only to get splattered with a tomato, which irritates him.\n\n\n\nOn this occasion, Daffy Duck is seen as a much more self-centered individual who shows willingness to do anything to get what he wants, whether it was money or fame, instead of being seen as a trouble inducing screwball. This, in turn, is indirectly a foreshadowing of the character he would later become, particularly in \"Rabbit Fire\", and onward. It was also Friz Freleng's first film back at the studio after being at MGM for two years. The film has become one of the better known shorts made by Warner Bros, and in 1994 was voted #34 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field.\n\n\n\"You Ought to Be in Pictures\" is available on \"\", on Disc 4, on \"\", on Disc 1 and also on \"Porky Pig 101\", Disc 4. Prior to that, it had been included as part of the 1985 VHS \"Golden Jubilee\" release \"Porky Pig's Screwball Comedies\".\n\n"}

Proponents argue that this restriction in performance reduces the amount of noise when the drive is playing a DVD by providing the lowest rotational speed that allows for adequate data transfer from the DVD to the computer. \n\nDoubt is cast on this argument when it's pointed out that the most significant effect is to limit both the reading and writing (burning) of DVD video to the DVD media, presumably as an attempt to restrict video piracy. For example, Riplock does not affect the reading or writing to CD media transfer rates nor does it affect the rates of non video data being written to DVD media. This lends support to the theory that the MPAA has used its influence with different manufacturers to disable full functionality on consumer level CD/DVD drives specifically targeting DVD video files.\n\nThis slow speed and low data rate hobbles the drives functionality and greatly increases seek find times, general performance and specifically write times (to an hour or more). On some riplock-equipped drives, riplock can be removed by firmware reflashing by the drives firmware (referred to as \"read speed patch\" or \"riplock patch\"). It can also be disabled on some drives such as the Lite-On model iHAS324B by pressing the eject button for three seconds without any disc inserted.\n\n"}

The station was opened in 1967 and closed in 1981.\n\nHoneysuckle Creek – with a 26m dish (now relocated and decommissioned) – is renowned as the station which received and relayed to the world the first televised footage of astronaut Neil Armstrong setting foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969. Apart from television pictures, Honeysuckle Creek and Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex (Tidbinbilla) had communication and telemetry contact with the \"Eagle\" lunar and \"Columbia\" command modules. Much of this was dramatized as involving Parkes Observatory (Parkes) in the 2000 Australian film \"The Dish\". In fact, Parkes received only the landing footage. Six hours later, the first steps on the Moon were transmitted from Honeysuckle Creek. Although the Parkes antenna was more powerful, the angle of its dish – at a lowermost pitch of 30-degrees and buffeted by wind gusts up to 100 km/h – was not in line to receive signals during the first seven minutes of the Moon Walk. Honeysuckle Creek signals were sent direct to OTC Sydney via Williamdale and Red Hill (Canberra). Working for NASA, Charlie Goodman selected the audiovisual feeds from Honeysuckle Creek and Parkes for worldwide broadcasts.\n\nThe Honeysuckle Creek and Tidbinbilla antennas were built and run by NASA, but staffed by Australians. It was the policy of the Australian Government that the director had to be a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. When Apollo missions ended in 1972, Honeysuckle Creek was redirected to the new Skylab program. As well, it was used for experiments with Apollo scientific stations placed on the Moon by astronauts.\n\nAt the end of the Skylab program in 1974, Honeysuckle Creek was connected to the Deep Space Network with the designation Deep Space Station 44. Honeysuckle Creek closed in December 1981. The 26m antenna was relocated nearby to the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex at Tidbinbilla, and redesignated Deep Space Station 46. The Antenna was decommissioned in late 2009. In May 2010, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics declared the antenna a Historical Aerospace Site. The antenna remains in perpetuity as a historical site at Tidbinbilla.\n\nToday, at Honeysuckle Creek, the concrete foundation is the only remnant of the tracking station. An outdoor display was added in 2001. Honeysuckle Creek is considered the geographical centre of the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nThe climate at Honeysuckle Creek—as to be expected of its much greater altitude—is significantly cooler than that of Canberra. Notwithstanding, it is rather warm for its altitude and latitude due to the fact that it still lies on the leeward side of the ranges; in this case, it lies in the lee of the Brindabella Range—the northernmost branch of the Snowy Mountains.\n\nAnnually, it receives 14.4 snowy days on average.\n\n"}

Originally airing in Japan on February 24, 1993, between , the special is based on an extra chapter of the manga series. It depicts an alternate version of the future in which Goku dies from the heart virus that afflicts him during the Androids Saga, and a teenage Trunks tries to defeat the androids as they ravage Earth.\n\nGoku dies from a viral heart disease, and six months later, all the Z-Fighters except Gohan are killed by Android #17 and Android #18. With the death of Piccolo, Kami dies as well and the Dragon Balls are rendered permanently useless, making it impossible for the Z Fighters to be revived.\n\nThirteen years later, Gohan, now a Super Saiyan, repeatedly tries to challenge the androids, but they are too strong. He begins training Trunks (the son of Vegeta and Bulma), who is eager to defend the Earth. Gohan attempts to provoke Trunks enough to trigger his transformation into a Super Saiyan. Several times, Trunks comes close, but lacks enough motivation to maintain the form.\n\nThe androids attack an amusement park. Gohan transforms and battles them but is being overwhelmed. Trunks comes to his aid and fights Android #18 but is easily defeated. Gohan saves him and they hide in some debris. Unable to find their targets, the androids bomb the entire area and leave. Trunks and Gohan survive, but at the cost of Gohan's left arm. They go home where he recovers and resume Trunks' training.\n\nJust as the training is finished, a huge explosion hits the city. Gohan pretends to agree to allow Trunks to join him in the battle, then knocks him unconscious and goes alone. Gohan, having received a significant zenkai power up to Super Saiyan and puts up a very good fight against the androids, but his lost left arm proves to be a major disadvantage and he is eventually killed. Trunks awakens after sensing Gohan's energy signal vanish, and hurries to the city to find Gohan's body laying face down in a puddle of water. Trunks is enraged at the death of his best friend, which finally triggers his transformation into a Super Saiyan.\n\nThree years later, Trunks and Bulma are working on a time machine when a warning sounds, indicating that the androids are nearby. Trunks confronts them but is badly beaten and left for dead. He awakens in his house with his mother at his side, and finally decides they must use the time machine to deliver the medicine needed to cure Goku's heart disease years ago by giving it to Goku himself, hoping that this will prevent Goku's death and prevent their future from happening. The movie closes as Trunks bids his mother farewell and departs for the past in the time machine.\n\nAs the credits roll, scenes are shown of Trunks' battle with Mecha-Frieza, his encounter with Goku and the Z Fighters, and the awakening of Androids 17 and 18.\n\nGoku is listed in the credits of this special, despite not having any lines.\n\nThe following songs were present in the English version of \"Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks\", as well as its accompanying soundtrack CD, with exception to most of Dream Theater's music, \"Home\" being the only track showcased in the soundtrack from them and \"Prelude\" by Slaughter. The soundtrack also contained remixes of other songs.\n\n\nIn the US, \"Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks\" was first released to VHS on October 24, 2000 in two formats, \"Uncut\" and \"Edited\". The uncut English version was released on DVD that same year, as well as the original Japanese version.

Progressive metal band Dream Theater's album \"Scenes From A Memory\" is featured on the American version of the movie as the main soundtrack.\nAnime News Network's reviewer Chris Shepard stated: \"It is interesting... Gohan and Trunks are both understandable characters who I was really able to get into and sympathize for during their battles\" but also felt a \"good understanding of the happenings of the TV series is recommended\". He also felt that the action sequences were exceptional and did not \"overdo themselves\". He expressed some disappointment in the English dub as the storyline sounded \"completely alien\" to the Japanese subtitles. For his final grade he noted \"[the] Dub doesn't contain the original music... [it] isn't true to the original\" but was pleased overall.\n\nJohn Sinnott of DVDTalk praised the television special, seeing it as being separate from the other episodes of \"Dragon Ball\". He believed this to be a positive attribute. Regarding the Blu-ray release of the film he was less impressed with the color and aspect ratio, citing them as not particularly \"exciting\". However he expressed joy at Funimation leaving the original Japanese soundtrack and the English voice dubs in, describing them as \"enveloping\". For fans of \"Dragon Ball\" he recommended watching the episode as it \"worked a lot better than the average theatrical film since they follow \"DBZ\" continuity and expand the story while filling in details\". Like Shepard the Sinnott review advised those who are not familiar to the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise to avoid the episode but that fans will enjoy it. In conclusion he felt the film was enjoyable at best.\n\n"}

The second LP Gaye released on the label, it also produced his first batch of successful singles for the label and established Gaye as one of the label's first hit-making acts in its early years.\n\nFollowing the release of Gaye's first album, \"The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye\", Gaye and Motown were in a struggle to agree with the direction his career should take. Despite the failure of Gaye's debut, which featured jazz and blues songs with only a few R&B songs, Gaye had no desire to have an R&B career, figuring he wouldn't get much exposure from a crossover audience singing R&B. Motown CEO Berry Gordy also had difficulty on how to present the music to the buying public. Though artists like The Miracles and Mary Wells had R&B success, they hardly were noticed by pop audiences. And while Motown's first signing act, Marv Johnson, was one of the label's earliest hitmakers, most of his music was released to United Artists, while Motown Recordings and its imprints Tamla, Motown and Gordy, had still not produced much success. Early releases by The Temptations and The Supremes also failed to gain national attention.\n\nFinally, however, after the release of The Marvelettes' \"Please Mr. Postman\", which had a younger R&B sound that also attracted pop audiences and became Motown's first number-one pop single, Gordy decided to have its artists produce a much younger R&B sound. Though Marvin Gaye initially didn't want to go along with it, after seeing the success the Marvelettes had had with a song he co-wrote for them, \"Beechwood 4-5789\" and the emerging pop success of Mary Wells, Gaye changed his mind and began composing songs with collaborator Mickey Stevenson, determined to get footing in the still-fledgling label.\n\nLike most Motown albums of the sixties, this album was produced quickly. Gaye wrote or co-wrote the majority of the songs on the album, often with Stevenson but also including other songwriters such as George Gordy, Barrett Strong, and Norman Whitfield, who had spent the early years of his career in Motown as a member of the label's Quality Control Department team. \n\nFor the majority of the songs, Gaye enlisted the background vocal helping of a young group named The Del-Phis. Its members were Gloria Williams, Rosalind Ashford, Annette Beard and Martha Reeves. Gordy later changed their name to The Vandellas after the group had been told to change their name before he signed them. Reeves later recalled that upon first meeting Gaye of how shy he was, wearing a hat, glasses and a cigar but had a crush on him as he took the hat and glasses off and began singing. In reaction to how handsome they perceive Gaye, the Vandellas began adding cooing-type background vocals.\n\nThe Vandellas would be joined in the background list of singers with The Love Tones (who did backing vocals for other Motown artists, most notably Mary Wells), the Rayber Voices, and The Andantes and struggling Motown groups The Temptations and The Supremes while the music was mainly handled by the label's in-house background band, later known as The Funk Brothers. Gaye himself added instrumentation, performing drums on a few songs and piano in others. The songs on \"That Stubborn Kinda Fellow\" incorporated elements of R&B, blues and doo-wop music, while also incorporating a then-nascent subgenre of R&B titled soul music, which Gaye would become one of the genre's major contributors and popularizers.\n\nThe album was issued in December 1962 on the Tamla subsidiary of Motown. While the album itself didn't chart (the R&B album chart wouldn't be created until 1965), several of the songs released off the album did chart. The first single was actually the Stevenson composition \"Soldier's Plea\", which had been issued initially as a non-album single and didn't chart but was included on the album as a filler track. The second single, \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\", was the first charted single for Gaye, reaching #8 R&B and peaking at #46 pop in late 1962. The two other singles released from the album, \"Hitch Hike\" and \"Pride and Joy\", would fare even better on the pop charts, with \"Hitch Hike\" reaching #30 and a single version of \"Pride and Joy\" reaching #10, becoming his first top ten pop single and was also his first R&B single to reach the top five, peaking at #2 on the chart, nearly selling a million copies. With this album and its singles, Gaye was firmly now part of Motown's growing hit elite.\n\nWhile not released as singles, the songs \"Got to Get My Hands on Some Lovin'\" and \"Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\" became popular in the UK Northern Soul scene of the sixties as did the released singles. The songs on the album also became extremely popular with the UK's Mod scene of that same time period, and some of the songs would be covered by so-called British R&B and beat groups such as The Rolling Stones and The Who (in an early incarnation). Back in the United States, pop producers were also impressed by the sound of the album, including Phil Spector, who was so amazed by the sound of \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\" that in his excitement, he nearly collided with another car as he was driving. Eventually Paul Young would cover \"Wherever I Lay My Hat\" in the UK, where the song became a number-one hit in 1983.\n\n\n\n"}

The project started in 2001 and operated from 2004 through 2011.\n\nThe TeraGrid integrated high-performance computers, data resources and tools, and experimental facilities. Resources included more than a petaflops of computing capability and more than 30 petabytes of online and archival data storage, with rapid access and retrieval over high-performance computer network connections. Researchers could also access more than 100 discipline-specific databases.\n\nTeraGrid was coordinated through the Grid Infrastructure Group (GIG) at the University of Chicago, working in partnership with the resource provider sites in the United States.\n\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF) issued a solicitation asking for a \"distributed terascale facility\" from program director Richard L. Hilderbrandt.\nThe TeraGrid project was launched in August 2001 with $53 million in funding to four sites: the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the University of California, San Diego, the University of Chicago Argonne National Laboratory, and the Center for Advanced Computing Research (CACR) at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe design was meant to be an extensible distributed open system from the start.\nIn October 2002, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh joined the TeraGrid as major new partners when NSF announced $35 million in supplementary funding. The TeraGrid network was transformed through the ETF project from a 4-site mesh to a dual-hub backbone network with connection points in Los Angeles and at the Starlight facilities in Chicago.\n\nIn October 2003, NSF awarded $10 million to add four sites to TeraGrid as well as to establish a third network hub, in Atlanta. These new sites were Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Purdue University, Indiana University, and the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nTeraGrid construction was also made possible through corporate partnerships with Sun Microsystems, IBM, Intel Corporation, Qwest Communications, Juniper Networks, Myricom, Hewlett-Packard Company, and Oracle Corporation.\n\nTeraGrid construction was completed in October 2004, at which time the TeraGrid facility began full production.\n\nIn August 2005, NSF's newly created office of cyberinfrastructure extended support for another five years with a $150 million set of awards. It included $48 million for coordination and user support to the Grid Infrastructure Group at the University of Chicago led by Charlie Catlett.\nUsing high-performance network connections, the TeraGrid featured high-performance computers, data resources and tools, and high-end experimental facilities around the USA. The work supported by the project is sometimes called e-Science.\nIn 2006, the University of Michigan's School of Information began a study of TeraGrid.\n\nIn May 2007, TeraGrid integrated resources included more than 250 teraflops of computing capability and more than 30 petabytes (quadrillions of bytes) of online and archival data storage with rapid access and retrieval over high-performance networks. Researchers could access more than 100 discipline-specific databases. In late 2009, The TeraGrid resources had grown to 2 petaflops of computing capability and more than 60 petabytes storage. In mid 2009, NSF extended the operation of TeraGrid to 2011.\n\nA follow-on project was approved in May 2011.\nIn July 2011, a partnership of 17 institutions announced the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). NSF announced funding the XSEDE project for five years, at $121 million.\nXSEDE is led by John Towns at the University of Illinois's National Center for Supercomputing Applications.\n\nTeraGrid resources are integrated through a service-oriented architecture in that each resource provides a \"service\" that is defined in terms of interface and operation. Computational resources run a set of software packages called \"Coordinated TeraGrid Software and Services\" (CTSS). CTSS provides a familiar user environment on all TeraGrid systems, allowing scientists to more easily port code from one system to another. CTSS also provides integrative functions such as single-signon, remote job submission, workflow support, data movement tools, etc. CTSS includes the Globus Toolkit, Condor, distributed accounting and account management software, verification and validation software, and a set of compilers, programming tools, and environment variables.\n\nTeraGrid uses a 10 Gigabits per second dedicated fiber-optical backbone network, with hubs in Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. All resource provider sites connect to a backbone node at 10 Gigabits per second. Users accessed the facility through national research networks such as the Internet2 Abilene backbone and National LambdaRail.\n\nTeraGrid users primarily came from U.S. universities. There are roughly 4,000 users at over 200 universities. Academic researchers in the United States can obtain exploratory, or \"development\" allocations (roughly, in \"CPU hours\") based on an abstract describing the work to be done. More extensive allocations involve a proposal that is reviewed during a quarterly peer-review process. All allocation proposals are handled through the TeraGrid website. Proposers select a scientific discipline that most closely describes their work, and this enables reporting on the allocation of, and use of, TeraGrid by scientific discipline. As of July 2006 the scientific profile of TeraGrid allocations and usage was:\n\nEach of these discipline categories correspond to a specific program area of the National Science Foundation.\n\nStarting in 2006, TeraGrid provided application-specific services to \"Science Gateway\" partners, who serve (generally via a web portal) discipline-specific scientific and education communities. Through the Science Gateways program TeraGrid aims to broaden access by at least an order of magnitude in terms of the number of scientists, students, and educators who are able to use TeraGrid.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the \"de facto\" governor of Hong Kong as commander-in-chief and head of the military administration from September 1945 to June 1946. He was called by the Chinese name \"Ha Kok\", a reference to the fourth-century Chinese nobleman .\n\nHarcourt was born in Bromley, Kent, England, to Halliday Harcourt and Grace Lilian (née Jepson) on 11 April 1892. He was educated at Fonthill, East Grinstead, and later at the Royal Naval College at Osborne and Dartmouth (1904–1909). He had a distinguished career in the Royal Navy, which he entered as a midshipman on 15 September 1904, at the age of 12. He served in both world wars.\n\nIn 1939, Harcourt was appointed Director of the Admiralty's Operations Division. In 1941 he was Flag Captain of the Home Fleet, while commanding HMS \"Duke of York\". In August 1942 until January 1943 he commanded the 10th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. From 1942 to 1944 he took part in the North Africa campaign, the capture of Tunisia, Pantelleria, Lampedusa, and Sicily, and the landing at Salerno. In 1944, he became Naval Secretary. In 1945, he was Flag Officer Commanding 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron, with his flag in HMS \"Colossus\".\n\nHarcourt commanded Task Group 111.2 for the reoccupation of Hong Kong with his carriers, three cruisers, four destroyers, a submarine, and mine-sweeping flotillas. He ordered his carriers' planes to destroy a small number of Japanese suicide motor boats near Hong Kong. The pre-war colonial secretary Franklin Gimson took Harcourt to the prisoner of war camps and hospitals. Their first stop was the Stanley Internment Camp, which Harcourt reported:\nOn arriving we found everyone awaiting us and we had a most unforgettable welcome. The Union Flag had been produced by an ex-Naval rating who had hidden it in his bedding when Hong Kong was captured and had managed to hide it for the whole period so as to be ready for this occasion. The morale ... was extremely high despite the obvious effects of malnutrition which could be seen on every face. The enthusiasm and the cheering really had to be seen and heard to be believed, it was so obviously spontaneous and seemed to express the pent-up feelings of all these years. I shall never forget it.\nOn 16 September, Harcourt received the surrender of Japan (under Major-General Hisakazu Tanaka and Vice-Admiral Ruitaka Fujitain) in Government House. He was the \"de facto\" governor of Hong Kong as commander-in-chief and head of the military administration until June 1946. On 18 December 1945, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In 1946, he was promoted to vice-admiral.\n\nIn 1947, Harcourt became Flag Officer (Air) and Second in Command Mediterranean Fleet. In 1948, he became Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel as well as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, and in 1950 Commander-in-Chief, The Nore. He retired in 1952.

The anthropological concept branches from the observations of animal ownership behaviors. Personal space can be regarded as a bubble with a person at the center, forming an area which the person does not wish to be invaded.\n\nAn example of demonstrating territoriality might be the car size. Driving a large truck like the Ford F-350 might be communicating that a value of owning a lot of space on the highway. However, driving a small car like the Smart, then might be communicating no need to occupy so much space. Another example is students as they sit in class. Some students like to spread their backpack and books out in a way to let other students know that they do not want others to sit next to them. These students seem to value having a lot of space to themselves. On the other hand, some students keep their books and bags close to them, making others aware that they have no problem in sharing space with other students.\n\nThe term stimulated Edward T. Hall to create the word proxemics, which refers to how people use space, but not necessarily how people communicate ownership .\n\nTerritoriality can also be associated with nation-states. Government and social ideas are also associated with territoriality. A nation-state can establish common ideals amongst its citizens which lead to territoriality. Nationalism is an example of this. National pride, common religious practices, and politics all play a role in a state's territoriality.\n\nAn example of this would be the conflict in Northern Ireland. The island of Ireland as a whole and the Republic of Ireland (which has the majority of the island's area and residents) both have Catholic majorities while the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland (which is a part of the UK and constitutes less than half of the island of Ireland's area and residents) both have Protestant majorities. Many Irish people in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland don't want Northern Ireland to be a part of a nation that is not Catholic-majority, since Catholicism is the religion of the majority of the Irish nation and the religion of the majority of people on the island of Ireland. Territorial disputes in Northern Ireland have been justified by religion. This is an example of how religion can play a strong role in territoriality.\n\nIn the postwar era human territoriality was commonly believed to be the product of human instinct, akin or analogous to territorial behaviour in animals.\n\nSince the 1980s, human territoriality has been instead studied as the product of sociopolitical processes. Robert Sack's 'Human Territoriality' popularised this position, describing human territoriality as a powerful strategy. In the field of International Relations, John Ruggie argued that territoriality was the organizing principle for modern international politics and could be contrasted with medieval heteronomous orders. Following Ruggie, a number of works have sought to explain how territoriality became the dominant principle of European international relations and/or question his broadly Westphalian chronology of the modern territorial order.\n\nAccording to author Julia T. Wood, \"men go into women's spaces more than women enter men's spaces\" . With this in mind, we can understand that men typically have a stronger sense of ownership and are more likely to challenge others' boundaries. People respond to invasion of territory in different ways depending on what their comfort norms are. Wood (2007) presents three common responses:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is also known as \"focal glomerular sclerosis\" or \"focal nodular glomerulosclerosis.\" It accounts for about a sixth of the cases of nephrotic syndrome. (Minimal change disease (MCD) is by far the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children: MCD and primary FSGS may have a similar cause.)\n\nDepending on the cause it is broadly classified as:\n\nThere are many other classification schemes also.\n\nFive mutually exclusive variants of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may be distinguished by the pathologic findings seen on renal biopsy:\n\nRecognition of these variants may have prognostic value in individuals with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (i.e. where no underlying cause is identified). The collapsing variant is associated with higher rate of progression to end-stage renal disease, whereas glomerular tip lesion variant has a low rate of progression to end-stage renal disease in most patients. Cellular variant shows similar clinical presentation to collapsing and glomerular tip variant but has intermediate outcomes between these two variants. However, because collapsing and glomerular tip variant show overlapping pathologic features with cellular variant, this intermediate difference in clinical outcomes may reflect a sampling bias in cases of cellular focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (i.e. unsampled collapsing variant or glomerular tip variant). The prognostic significance of perihilar and NOS variants has not yet been determined. The NOS variant is the most common subtype. Collapsing variant is the most common type of glomerulopathy caused by HIV infection.\n\nSome general secondary causes are listed below:\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis may develop following acquired loss of nephrons from reflux nephropathy. Proteinuria is nonselective in most cases and may be in subnephrotic range (nephritic range <3.0gm/24hr) or nephritic range.\n\nThere are currently several known genetic causes of the hereditary forms of FSGS.\n\nSome researchers found SuPAR as a cause of FSGS.\n\nAnother gene that has been associated with this syndrome is the COL4A5 gene.\n\nIn children and some adults, FSGS presents as a nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by edema (associated with weight gain), hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin, a protein in the blood), hyperlipidemia and hypertension (high blood pressure). In adults, it may also present as kidney failure and proteinuria, without a full-blown nephrotic syndrome.\n\n\n\nCorticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs \nThe individual components of the name refer to the appearance of the kidney tissue on biopsy: \"focal\"—only some of the glomeruli are involved (as opposed to diffuse), \"segmental\"—only part of each glomerulus is involved (as opposed to global), \"glomerulosclerosis\"—refers to scarring of the glomerulus (a part of the nephron (the functional unit of the kidney)).

The Städel Museum owns 3,100 paintings, 660 sculptures, more than 4,600 photographs and more than 100,000 drawings and prints. It has around 4,000 m² of display and a library of 115,000 books. \n\nThe Städel was honoured as “Museum of the Year 2012” by the German art critics association AICA in 2012. In the same year the museum recorded the highest attendance figures in its history, of 447,395 visitors.\n\nThe Städel Museum was founded in 1817, and is one of the oldest museums in Frankfurt's Museumsufer, or museum embankment. The founding followed a bequest by the Frankfurt banker and art patron Johann Friedrich Städel (1728-1816), who left his house, art collection and fortune with the request in his will that the institute be set up.\n\nIn 1878, a new building, in the Gründerzeit style, was erected on Schaumainkai street, presently the major museum district. By the start of the 20th century, the gallery was among the most prominent German collections of classic Pan-European art; the other such collections open to the public were the Dresden Gallery, the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and the Altes Museum in Berlin. \n\nIn 1937, 77 paintings and 700 prints were confiscated from the museum when the National Socialists declared them \"degenerate art\". \n\nIn 1939, the collection was moved out of Frankfurt to protect it from damage in World War II. The collection of the Städel Museum was removed from the museum to avoid destruction from the Allied bombings, and the collection was stored in the Schloss Rossbach, a castle owned by the Baron Thüngen near Bad Brückenau in Bavaria. There, the museum's paintings and library were discovered by Lt. Thomas Carr Howe, USN, of the American Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives program. Although the Baron von Thüngen and his wife were uncooperative with the Americans, Frau Dr. Holzinger, a licensed physician and the Swiss wife of the Städel Museum director, was present at the site and assisted with the cataloging and the removal of the items to the Munich Central Collecting Point. Lt. Howe said, “The first room to be inspected was a library adjoining the sitting room in which we had been waiting. Here we found a quantity of excellent French Impressionist paintings, all from the permanent collection of the Städel Museum, and a considerable number of fine Old Master drawings. Most of these were likewise the property of the museum, but a few – I remember one superb Rembrandt sketch – appeared to have come from Switzerland. Those would, of course, have to be looked into later, to determine their exact origin and how they came to be on loan to the museum. But for the moment we were concerned primarily with storage conditions and the problem of security. In another room we found an enormous collection of books, the library of one of the Frankfurt museums. In a third we encountered an array of medieval sculpture – saints all sizes and description, some of carved wood, others of stone, plain or polychromed. These too, were of museum origin. The last storage room was below ground, a vast, cavernous chamber beneath the house. Here was row upon row of pictures, stacked in two tiers down the center of the room and also along two sides. From what we could make of them in the poor light, they were not of high quality. During the summer months they would be alright in the underground room, but we thought the place would be very damp in the winter. Frau Holzinger assured us that this was so and that the pictures should be removed before the bad weather set in.”\n\nThe gallery was substantially damaged by air raids in World War II and it was rebuilt by 1966 following a design by the Frankfurt architect Johannes Krahn. An expansion building for the display of 20th-century work and special exhibits was erected in 1990, designed by the Austrian architect Gustav Peichl. Small structural changes and renovations took place from 1997 to 1999.\n\nThe largest extension in the history of the museum intended for the presentation of contemporary art was designed by the Frankfurt architectural firm and opened in February 2012.\n\nThe Städel Museum is currently significantly enlarging its activities and outreach through a major digital expansion on the occasion of its 200-year anniversary in 2015. Already available to visitors is an exhibition 'digitorial' and free access to WiFi throughout the museum and its grounds. From March the museum will offer to visitors a new Städel app, the possibility of listening to audio guides on their own devices, and a new 'cabinet of digital curiosities'. Several more projects are currently in development including an online exhibition platform; educational computer games for children; online art-history courses and a digital art book.\n\nThe Städel Museum has European paintings from seven centuries, beginning with the early 14th century, moving into Late Gothic, the Renaissance, Baroque, and into the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

On a film set with a plantation background, Jolson in blackface sings three of his hit songs: \"April Showers\", \"Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody\", and \"When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)\". The film presents him as if in a live stage performance, complete with three curtain calls at the finish. Its premiere took place on October 7, 1926, at the Colony Theatre, New York, where it concluded a program of short subjects that accompanied Warner Brothers' second feature-length Vitaphone film \"The Better 'Ole\". The \"Intermission\" card which appears at its end derives from that use. Critics praised \"A Plantation Act\" as the hit of the show.\n\nThe short was long believed to be a lost film, and its unavailability fueled the misconception that Jolson's first sound film was the famous feature-length milestone \"The Jazz Singer\", which premiered almost exactly one year later. A mute print of \"A Plantation Act\" was eventually found in the Library of Congress, mislabeled as a preview for \"The Jazz Singer\". A copy of the corresponding soundtrack disc also came to light, but it had been broken into four pieces and glued back together so imperfectly that it would not play through. After some careful surgery, restoration technicians succeeded in making a usable dub from the disc and digitally removing the pops and clicks resulting from the damage. The restored film was included on a LaserDisc published in the 1990s and as a bonus feature on the 2007 3-disc DVD release of \"The Jazz Singer\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2277192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277192", "title": "Geotextile", "text": "Geotextile\n\nGeotextiles are permeable fabrics which, when used in association with soil, have the ability to separate, filter, reinforce, protect, or drain. Typically made from polypropylene or polyester, geotextile fabrics come in three basic forms: woven (resembling mail bag sacking), needle punched (resembling felt), or heat bonded (resembling ironed felt).\n\nGeotextile composites have been introduced and products such as geogrids and meshes have been developed. Geotextiles are able to withstand many things, are durable, and are able to soften a fall if someone falls down. Overall, these materials are referred to as geosynthetics and each configuration—geonets, geosynthetic clay liners, geogrids, geotextile tubes, and others—can yield benefits in geotechnical and environmental engineering design.\n\nGeotextiles were originally intended to be an alternative to granular soil filters. The original, and still sometimes used, term for geotextiles is \"filter fabrics\". Work originally began in the 1950s with R.J. Barrett using geotextiles behind precast concrete seawalls, under precast concrete erosion control blocks, beneath large stone riprap, and in other erosion control situations. He used different styles of woven monofilament fabrics, all characterized by a relatively high percentage open area (varying from 6 to 30%). He discussed the need for both adequate permeability and soil retention, along with adequate fabric strength and proper elongation and set the tone for geotextile use in filtration situations.\n\nGeotextiles and related products have many applications and currently support many civil engineering applications including roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, bank protection, coastal engineering and construction site silt fences or geotube. Usually geotextiles are placed at the tension surface to strengthen the soil. Geotextiles are also used for sand dune armoring to protect upland coastal property from storm surge, wave action and flooding. A large sand-filled container (SFC) within the dune system prevents storm erosion from proceeding beyond the SFC. Using a sloped unit rather than a single tube eliminates damaging scour.\n\nErosion control manuals comment on the effectiveness of sloped, stepped shapes in mitigating shoreline erosion damage from storms. Geotextile sand-filled units provide a \"soft\" armoring solution for upland property protection. Geotextiles are used as matting to stabilize flow in stream channels and swales.\n\nGeotextiles can improve soil strength at a lower cost than conventional soil nailing. In addition, geotextiles allow planting on steep slopes, further securing the slope.\n\nGeotextiles have been used to protect the fossil hominid footprints of Laetoli in Tanzania from erosion, rain, and tree roots.\n\nIn building demolition, geotextile fabrics in combination with steel wire fencing can contain explosive debris.\n\nCoir (coconut fiber) geotextiles are popular for erosion control, slope stabilization and bioengineering, due to the fabric's substantial mechanical strength. Coir geotextiles last approximately 3 to 5 years depending on the fabric weight. The product degrades into humus, enriching the soil.\n\nIn many of the world's big cities, the increasing extent of impervious surfaces is leading to water pollution, run-off, and in cases of heavy rainfall, major flooding that is affecting people's homes, businesses, and livelihoods. The city of Portland lies on the Willamette river basin, and is no stranger to this issue. Before mass development, there were original wetlands and floodplains that helped filter and naturally drain water from large rain storms or overflowing banks. However, suburbanization and urban sprawl have accelerated the construction of more impervious surfaces which have covered, drained, and filled the floodplains for transportation, agriculture, and development.\n\nEnvironmental Services, a government agency that manages Portland's wastewater and stormwater infrastructure, recognized this phenomenon, and in 2004, partnered with the neighborhood of Westmoreland in attempt to solve this problem with road fabric: \"geotextile fabric layers reduce pollutants carried into the soil as the water infiltrates. They also prevent fine soil particles from migrating into the void space within the base rock.\" They paved 1000 feet of street surface with interlocking blocks made of concrete which allow water to filtrate towards the ground through the spaces between the blocks. They then filled the gaps with fine sediment on top of a stronger base of rock. Geotextile fabric was then placed below the more solid layer to reduce pollutant flow. This reduced the amount of stormwater going through the sewer system and the run-off that would eventually be discharged into the river. \n\nOn a larger scale, geotextile is paired with downspout disconnection, monitoring devices, vegetated infiltration areas, constructed wetlands, increased tree canopy, ecoroofs, green streets, and permeable pavement to create a wider sustainable system to work with water, not against it. The Westmoreland pilot has been repeated in several other areas with these different mechanisms, alternating between a center strip of standard asphalt and permeable pavement in both curb lanes. If applicable, this system will allow stormwater to be absorbed, filtered, and cleaned before recharging groundwater city-wide, and may become the norm if policy allows.\n\nWhile many possible design methods or combinations of methods are available to the geotextile designer, the ultimate decision for a particular application usually takes one of three directions: design by cost and availability, design by specification, or design by function. Extensive literature on design methods for geotextiles has been published in the peer reviewed journal \"Geotextiles and Geomembranes\".\n\n\n"}

It was published in 1879, inscribed \"to his dear friend Pablo de Sarasate\". The work is in three movements:\n\n\nWritten during the relatively stable period of Wieniawski’s residence in St Petersburg, the second Violin Concerto in D minor, op.22 is generally considered as his finest work. Richly melodic and highly idiomatic the work balances the elements of style dispassionately and serenely. Wieniawski first played the work in St Petersburg on 27 November 1862 under the baton of Anton Rubinstein.\n\nBoth main elements of the first movement, its sombre, restless first subject, and its lyrical pendant (begun by a solo horn) are discussed freely and subject to dazzling embellishments by the solo violin. This movement includes a demanding variety of technique, including chromatic glissandi, double stops, arpeggios, sixths, octaves, thirds, chromatic scales, and artificial harmonics, not to mention a myriad of bowing techniques. The beat is based on a 4/4 or common time. The first movement uses a half-sonata form where the orchestral coda after the exposition transitions into the second movement instead of a development section.\n\nThe slow movement, a \"Romance\", follows without a break. It is based on a lilting tune in 12/8 time and rises to an impassioned central climax.\n\nA rhapsodic passage marked \"Allegro con fuoco\" and mainly a solo cadenza, leads to the finale, a dashing rondo in the gypsy style, which quotes the first movement's subsidiary theme in the course of its second and third episodes. The final movement implements a 2/4 time, which allows the violinists to emphasize certain notes in the beginning of some measures.\n\nWieniawski's second Violin Concerto remains one of the most popular violin concertos of the Romantic era, memorable for its lush and moving melodies and harmonies.\n\nThe concerto is scored for solo violin and an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones (alto, tenor and bass), timpani, and strings.\n\n"}

He joined his first club, UMFS Dalvík, at the age of eight in 1985. He spent a further eight years in the club's development squads, progressing through the different youth team age brackets (Under-10s, Under-12s, Under-15s etc.) and debuting for the club's reserves whilst he was still only 13. He was handed his first team debut in 1993 when he was 15 years old. He scored five goals in 11 league appearances before his performances earned him a transfer to Þróttur in 1994, aged 16.\n\nIn three seasons, Heiðar scored 31 goals in 54 league appearances for Þróttur, his performances generating interest from several European clubs.\n\nHeiðar arrived at Lillestrøm in the autumn of 1998. He made his first team debut in October, curiously wearing number 1 on his shirt. The next season Heiðar became one of the great surprises in Norwegian football when he scored sixteen league goals (in his debut season for Lillestrøm he'd managed only two). Heiðar was a very popular player, and even had his own fan-club named \"\"The Helgusonsons\"\".\n\nHeiðar was signed by Watford manager Graham Taylor midway through the 1999–2000 season for a club record £1.5m. Brought in to boost the struggling club's striking department, Heiðar had a good debut at home to Liverpool, where he played well. Heiðar scored in his first game. He later picked up the display of the season award for this goal-scoring debut. He scored five more times that season. His goals were not enough to keep Watford up, and the Hertfordshire club were relegated after only one year in the Premier League.\n\nBack in the First Division, Heiðar was part of a Watford team that was undefeated for the first 15 games of the season, topping the league. However, when the team's form slumped in late 2000, Heiðar suffered a crisis of confidence – one of several during his first few years at Watford – and was well below his best for a large amount of that campaign. At the end of the season Taylor retired and was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, who used Heiðar as a wing back.\n\nWith Ray Lewington in charge for the 2002–03 season, Heiðar showed a marked improvement. Although still prone to injury (he did not start the season until late September), he finished the season Watford's top goal scorer with 13, including goals in Watford's run to the FA Cup semi-Finals. In 2003–04 injury kept Heiðar out of most of the first half of the season. On his return he put in some notable performances, the most notable being his leading of the line against Chelsea in the FA Cup.\n\n2004–05 was Heiðar's best season in a Watford shirt. Relatively free of injury, he scored 20 goals and picked up the \"Goal of the Season,\" \"Display of the Season\" and \"Player of the Season\" awards at the end of season awards ceremony. Inevitably, his goal tally brought about interest from Premier League clubs and with Watford needing money, the offer from Fulham was accepted.\n\nHeiðar signed for Fulham on 27 June 2005 and was largely confined to the bench at the beginning of the campaign. He scored his first goal for Fulham in the 5–4 League Cup victory over Lincoln. The front pair of Heiðar and Brian McBride caused trouble to the best defences in the Premier League. Heiðar scored against Chelsea (penalty), Aston Villa (penalty), West Ham (open play – left foot) and Manchester United (open play – header), a double in a 6–1 win over West Brom, Bolton Wanderers (header as a result of a free kick) and against Middlesbrough (penalty). For the start of the 2006–07 season he was moved from No. 10 to No. 9 at Fulham.\n\nOn 20 July 2007 it was announced that Heiðar was leaving Fulham to join Bolton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee, as part of manager Sammy Lee's squad restructuring. Heiðar reportedly signed a three-year contract with the Trotters, having been forced to consider his options following the signings of David Healy and Diomansy Kamara.\n\nHe made his Bolton debut as a substitute for the injured Kevin Davies on 11 August 2007 with Wanderers already trailing to Newcastle United. Four days later he returned to Fulham for the first time since leaving and got on the scoresheet in a 2–1 Bolton defeat.\n\nIt was the end of January 2008 by the time Heiðar got any more playing time, but his return was welcome with Bolton desperately short of firepower having sold Nicolas Anelka to Chelsea earlier on that month. His first appearance back in the team was a goalless draw against old club Fulham where he came off the substitutes bench for the last eight minutes of the game. He scored his first goal for Bolton since coming back from injury 4 days later against Reading in a 2–0 win.\n\nBolton confirmed in May 2008 that they had sent Heiðar over to Belgium for more surgery in order to have him back for pre-season training.\n\nOn 20 November, it was announced that Heiðar had joined Queens Park Rangers on an emergency loan until the end of January 2009. However, the loan did not go through until the following Friday.\n\nAfter failing to score on his debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers and in his second match against Sheffield Wednesday, Heiðar scored once against Plymouth Argyle and braces against both Preston North End and Blackpool to bag himself five goals in his first ten games. On 2 January, the deal was made permanent for an undisclosed fee.\n\nAfter spending a nearly a season out on loan to Watford, Heiðar returned to QPR. After regaining his place in the starting XI, scoring 13 goals as Rangers won the Championship in the 2010/11 season including a late winner against London rivals Crystal Palace at Loftus Road. Heiðar featured regularly under Neil Warnock for QPR in the Premier League, Heiðar became a Rangers legend by scoring the winning goal from a penalty in a 1–0 victory against arch rivals Chelsea. This was QPR's first win over Chelsea in over 15 years.\nHe then went on to score two goals against Stoke in a 3–2 victory away from home. He headed in a sublime goal, whilst the other goal was a tap in.\nOn 3 December 2011 he managed to equal the Queens Park Rangers record for most goals at home in a row. He scored with a header in a 1–1 draw with West Bromwich Albion.\n\nDespite missing most of the second half of the season with a groin injury, Heiðar finished as QPR's top goalscorer for the 11/12 season with 9 goals in all competitions. These goals proved crucial at Rangers avoided relegation on the final day of the season despite a 3–2 defeat away to Champions Manchester City.\n\nOn 15 September 2009, Watford successfully acquired the services of Heiðar, on a three-month loan from Queens Park Rangers, meaning the player returned to the club who he played for between 2000 and 2005. He made an immediate impact on his return, assisting one and scoring a brace during his substitute appearance against Leicester City, before being substituted due to injury. He made his fourth appearance of his loan spell at Vicarage Road against Scunthorpe United, scoring his fourth and fifth goal. Whilst the original loan spell ended on 28 December, there was constant speculation about the player resigning for the club on loan. On 11 January, both clubs confirmed that the loan deal was to be extended until the end of the season.\n\nOn 2 August 2012, Heiðar signed for Cardiff City on a one-year deal for an undisclosed fee and was given the number 22 shirt. Heiðar scored his first goal for Cardiff in a pre-season friendly against Bournemouth and his second came from the spot against Northampton Town in the League Cup on 14 August. He scored his first league goal in a Cardiff shirt in the Severnside derby on 25 August in a 4–2 loss. He then went on to score a brace against Ipswich Town, which kept Cardiff top of the table. Heiðar collected further goals for City at both Nottingham Forest and Charlton Athletic and at home against Hull City. Despite helping Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, Heiðar left the club when his contract expired at the end of the season.\n\nHeiðar made his debut for Iceland in an April 1999 friendly match against Malta, coming on as a substitute for Ríkharður Daðason, and as of October 2010 has earned 52 caps, scoring 12 goals. He was top scorer in the 2004 FA Summer Tournament with 3 goals. After playing in a friendly against Spain in August 2006, a long spell outside the national team followed during which Heiðar announced his retirement from international football, in June 2007.\n\nOn 28 August 2008, Heiðar announced his return to international football and was immediately selected in the Icelandic team to face Norway and Scotland a few days later. He scored a goal against Norway in the world cup qualifier as the match ended 2–2.\n\nQueens Park Rangers\n\nCardiff City\n\n"}

CBN broadcasts with 10,000 watts, unlike most other clear-channel, Class A stations, which broadcast with 50,000 watts. Per international agreement (NARBA), CBN is grandfathered at 10 kW and Class A, whereas the dominant station on this frequency throughout the Americas is KFI Los Angeles, which operates with 50 kW and Class A.\n\nCBN also broadcasts at 88.5 FM in the St. John's area.\n\nThe station began broadcasting at 8 p.m. on November 14, 1932 as VONF (Voice Of NewFoundland), broadcasting at 1195 kHz, and was owned and operated by the Dominion Broadcasting Company, a subsidiary of the Avalon Telephone Company (a predecessor of Bell Aliant). In 1934, it merged with a former competitor, VOGY 840, which had also launched in 1932. The VONF call sign was retained.\n\nOn March 13, 1939, the Dominion Broadcasting Company was absorbed by the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland, the pre-Confederation public broadcaster, as its first radio station. The frequency was eventually changed to its current 640 AM.\n\nBCN was absorbed by the CBC on March 31, 1949 when Newfoundland joined Canada. The call sign was then changed to CBN.\n\nCBN used to operate 10,000-watt rebroadcaster CBNM in Marystown on 740 AM (previously 570), but this station was converted to 90.3 FM in the 1980s.\n\nCBN is currently the largest Radio One station in eastern Canada that is still located on the AM band, along with CBY in Corner Brook, which also operates at 10,000 watts and has clear channel designation. CBN's daytime signal covers much of the Avalon Peninsula, at night, it reaches much of the eastern half of North America.\n\nUntil April 27, 2007, CBN's operations were located on 342 Duckworth Street. Those operations are currently located on 95 University Avenue, where the television operations are also based.\n\nThe station's local shows include \"The St. John's Morning Show\" with Krissy Holmes and Ramraajh Sharvendiran, \"Cross Talk\" with Ramona Dearing, \"On The Go\" with Ted Blades, \"The Fisheries Broadcast\" with Jane Adey, and \"Weekend AM\" with Heather Barrett.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the province's other five Radio One stations (CBG Gander, CBT Grand Falls-Windsor, CBY Corner Brook, CFGB-FM Happy Valley-Goose Bay and CBDQ-FM Labrador City) are semi-satellites of CBN, simulcasting most of CBN's local programming (other than the morning show on weekdays) during Radio One's local programming blocks.\n\nOne of the station's most popular shows in the 1930s and 1940s was \"The Barrelman\", hosted by future Premier Joey Smallwood.\n\nBy 1940, VONF operated a shortwave relay for remote areas of Newfoundland using the call sign VONG and operating on a frequency of 9.47 MHz (later 9.48, both in the 31-meter band). A second frequency of 5.98 MHz (later 5.97, both in the 49-meter band) was launched using the call sign VONH. Eventually, VONG left the air and only VONH remained. The call sign changed to CBNX in 1949 when the AM station became CBN. The frequency was changed to 6.16 MHz in 1963. In 1965, the call sign was changed to CKZN, recognizing that, technically, the CB call sign prefix was assigned to Chile on an international basis.\n\nIn 1989, the shortwave relay began to rebroadcast CFGB-FM in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, part-time as well as CBN. Eventually, in 1994, the station no longer relayed CBN, and became a full-time rebroadcaster of CFGB-FM. Most of Newfoundland had reliable AM or FM reception by that time, so the relay's main use was now limited to the remote areas of Labrador.\n\nCBN has the following rebroadcasters:\n\nCIBB-FM rebroadcasts programming of CBN, although it is owned by the Burgeo Broadcasting System.\n\nIn March 2016, The CBC made the decision to put a nested rebroadcaster in St. John's. It would broadcast at 88.5 MHz with an ERP of 3,612 Watts. On July 5, 2016, the station went on-air for testing. On August 1, 2016, the CRTC approved the decision to put a nested rebroadcaster in St. John's. CBN-1-FM began broadcasting on October 28, 2016.\n\n"}

Since 2016, it has also served as the headquarters of Bor Municipality. The city is situated on the east side of the White Nile (Bahr al Jabal River) at the southern extent of the sudd, South Sudan's vast central wetlands.\n\nBor is located on the site of a fishing village on the White Nile (Bahr al Jabal River), where an ivory-and-slave trading depot was established in the 1860s. It grew into a regional hub of the slave-and-ivory trade during the late nineteenth-century. In 1874, Charles George Gordon established a government station there under the Turkiyah Government. In the early years of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Bor was a \"wooding station\" for steamers travelling along the White Nile (Bahr al Jabal River). In 1905, Bor was established as the headquarters of the Bor-Duk District.\n\nBor is of historical importance to the people of South Sudan. It was in Malek, a small settlement about south of Bor, that one of the first modern Christian missions in present-day South Sudan was established by Archibald Shaw in 1906. Bor became the first area to host a Church Missionary Society station in 1906.\n\nMalek was turned into a missionary stronghold in the Upper Nile Region. Shaw opened the first primary school in Malek. This school produced the first indigenous Anglican bishop to be consecrated in Dinkaland, Rt. Rev. Daniel Deng Atong, followed the Nikonora Achiek Deng Ariir. John Aruor became the first legend to be baptized in 1916 in Bor.\n\nBor became an administrative centre under the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899–1956) for the Dinka people. Bor is the epicenter of the Second Sudanese Civil War. Dr. John Garang De Mabior, an officer in the Sudanese Army led a revolt in the town of Bor, in May 1983, leading to the birth of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement and Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA). Bor was also the scene of the 1991 Bor massacre, where approximately 2,000 people were killed. Eventually South Sudan became independent on 9 July 2011.\n\nFollowing the 2013 South Sudanese coup d'état attempt, Bor was contested in several weeks of combat between the national army and rebels led by Riek Machar. A portion of the Nuer White Army joined the fighting as well.\n\nIn 2016, Bor was designated as the seat of Bor Municipality. The same order sub-divided the former Bor County into five smaller counties, each containing a single payam. These new counties were Bor South County (Kolnyang payam), Bor East County (Anyidi Payam), Bor Central county (Makuach Payam), Bor West County (Baidit Payam), and Bor North County (Jalle Payam).\n\nThe town of Mading-Bor is Jonglei State's capital city, in central South Sudan, approximately , by road, north of Juba, the capital and largest city in the country. The town is located on the east bank of the White Nile.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw).\n\nThe 2008 population of Bor Payam was reported by the National Bureau of Statistics to be 61,716.\n\nKenya Commercial Bank (South Sudan) maintains a branch in Bor.\n\nThe John Garang Memorial University of Science and Technology, one of the seven public universities in the country, is located in Bor. The university is named after John Garang de Mabior (June 23, 1945 – July 30, 2005). Garang is considered the founder of modern South Sudan having led the South Sudanese movement Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement. He signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, an event which culminated in the independence of South Sudan in 2011. Garang died in a helicopter crash in 2005, 21 days following his swearing in as the first Vice President of Sudan and President of the Autonomous South Sudan. The John Garang Memorial University of Science and Technology was founded by the former governor of Jonglei State, Mr. Philip Thon Leek.\nBor is also the seat of an Anglican Diocese in the Episcopal Church of Sudan.\n\nBor is also served by Bor Airport, in addition to river traffic on the White Nile and three major roads that lead out of town.\n\n"}

As the soundtrack to the 1972 Blaxploitation film of the same name, the \"Trouble Man\" soundtrack was a more contemporary move for Gaye, following his politically charged album \"What's Going On\". This was the first album to be written and produced solely by Gaye. The only other album recorded under his full creative control was \"In Our Lifetime\", released in 1981.\n\nFollowing the success of \"What's Going On\", Marvin Gaye had not only won creative control, but a renewed $1 million contract with Motown subsidiary Tamla had made the musician the most profitable R&B artist of all time.\n\nSigning the contract in early 1972, Gaye sought to take advantage of his opportunities. Bolstered by the successes of film soundtracks such as \"Shaft\" and \"Superfly\", Motown offered the musician a chance to compose his own film soundtrack after winning rights to produce the crime thriller, \"Trouble Man\".\n\nUnlike Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield, who mixed social commentary with sexual songs in their respective soundtracks, Gaye chose to focus primarily on the film's character, \"Mister T\", producing and composing both the film's score while entirely producing the film's soundtrack, which was recorded at Motown Studios (or \"Hitsville West\") in Hollywood.\n\nFollowing the closing of Detroit's Hitsville USA studios in 1972, Motown had primarily moved its location to Los Angeles, where Gaye also relocated while he recorded the \"Trouble Man\" album. Gaye invited several musicians, including some from the Funk Brothers and musicians from Hamilton Bohannon's band.\n\nGaye would compose five different versions of the title track, including an alternate vocal version, which was used primarily for the film's intro. The alternate version featured Gaye double-tracking two lead vocal parts into one, bringing his falsetto vocals with his tenor on top of the falsetto. The single version, which was also featured on the soundtrack, would feature a single lead vocal take. The other three versions were put on the album as instrumentals with Gaye providing synthesizer keyboards while saxophone solos (and occasionally guitar) accompany him.\n\nThe only other songs in which Gaye vocalized harmonies or performed lead vocals included \"Poor Abbey Walsh\", \"Cleo's Apartment\", \"Life is a Gamble\", \"Don't Mess with Mister T\" and \"There Goes Mister T\".\n\nBolstered by the hit success of the title track, which returned Gaye to a blues format reaching #4 on the Soul Chart and #7 on the Pop Charts, respectively, the album followed in December where it reached the top 20 of the \"Billboard\" 200, peaking at #12. On Cashbox and Record World Magazines Charts the album even reached the Top 5, respectively, hitting almost as high as its monumental predecessor What‘s Going On, eighteen months earlier. \n\nIt would become Gaye's only soundtrack and film score. Critics gave the album favorable reviews while sometimes comparing Gaye's soundtrack efforts to that of Hayes' and Mayfield's. Following this, other R&B musicians would produce soundtracks of their own, including James Brown, Barry White and fellow Motown acts, Willie Hutch and Edwin Starr.\n\nThe album was referenced positively in the 2014 film \"\", with Falcon (Anthony Mackie) saying to Captain America (Chris Evans): \"everything you missed jammed into one album.\" There is also a clip of Trouble Man (single) playing on an iPhone in one hospital scene.\n\nAll songs written by Marvin Gaye.\n\nSide One\n\nSide Two\n\nDisc one (bonus tracks)\n\nDisc two (Original Film Score)\n\n\n"}

She is also featured in \"Richard Hammond's Crash Course\".\n\nPrior to joining the Toyota Atlantic series, Guildford-born Legge raced in several developmental open-wheel series in Britain, including Formula Three, Formula Renault and Formula Ford. In 2000, she was the first woman to achieve a pole in a Zetec race. In 2001, she beat Kimi Räikkönen's lap record and achieved a pole, and she was the first woman to receive the BRDC's \"Rising Star\" accolade.\n\nLegge's move to the United States came about in 2004, when after running out of finances to continue her racing career, she visited the UK offices of Cosworth, refusing to leave until she had met Cosworth boss Kevin Kalkhoven. Kalkhoven sent his daughter to speak to Legge to get her to leave: after a brief conversation with Legge, she instead told Kalkhoven that he should meet with her. Kalkhoven then offered her a drive in the first three rounds of the 2005 Toyota Atlantic Championship with Polestar Motor Racing: this was her first full-time drive. She won the series opener at Long Beach in her first career Atlantic start. In doing so, she became the first woman to win a developmental open-wheel race in North America. Legge went on to take her second and third wins of the season at Edmonton and San Jose. She finished the season 3rd in the championship with three wins and five podiums. She also received the Toyota Atlantic BBS Rising Star 2005 Award.\n\nIn November 2005, Legge became the first woman to test a Formula One car since Sarah Fisher in 2002, when she tested on the second and third days (22 and 23 November) of the Minardi team's final testing session at Vallelunga. After she crashed after 2 laps on her first run on the track, it was decided to postpone the test until the following day, on which she completed 27 laps with a best lap time of 1:21.176. She was also the first woman to test an A1 Grand Prix car, on 9–11 December 2005 with A1 Team Great Britain.\n\nShe received the 2005 RACER Magazine \"Most Promising Road Racer of The Year\" award, a title that had been awarded every year since 2002 to A. J. Allmendinger. Other recipients include Räikkönen, Jenson Button, Cristiano da Matta, Alex Barron, Giancarlo Fisichella, Greg Moore, and Gil de Ferran.\n\nIn the 2005–2006 off-season, Legge tested a Champ Car once for Rocketsports Racing and twice for PKV Racing. In February 2006, it was announced that she would drive for PKV Racing in the 2006 Champ Car season. In June, she became the first woman to lead a lap in series history, leading 12 laps at Milwaukee. Legge suffered a violent accident at the 2006 Grand Prix of Road America when the rear wing of her car broke; she was able to walk away from the car unharmed.\n\nLegge drove for Dale Coyne Racing in 2007, and her best result in the series was sixth place, twice.\n\nIn 2008, Legge moved to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters series, driving for Colin Kolles' Futurecom TME Audi team. For 2009 and 2010 she raced for the Abt Sportsline team, who were the 2008 champions. For 2009 she was the only one of the 5 drivers in the Abt Sportline team using the previous year's car.\n\nIn January 2012, Legge signed with Dragon Racing in the IndyCar Series, alongside Frenchman Sébastien Bourdais. Legge reached a two-year agreement with sponsor TrueCar as part of their Women Empowered campaign. However, since the Lotus engines were shown to be uncompetitive, the team made a change to Chevrolet engines. But team owner Jay Penske could only procure one Chevrolet engine lease agreement for the team, so they could only enter one car per race after Indianapolis. Therefore, for the remainder of 2012, Dragon entered Bourdais at the road and street courses, and Legge at oval tracks, except for Sonoma Raceway where both drivers were able to compete. Legge finished 26th in points, competing in ten of the 15 races, and had a best finish of ninth in the 2012 MAVTV 500 IndyCar World Championships at Auto Club Speedway.\n\nIn 2013, Legge left IndyCar to join the DeltaWing program in the United SportsCar Championship. Legge competed in the 2014 and 2015 seasons for DeltaWing.\n\nIn May 2015, Legge announced her involvement with the Grace Autosport project to enter the 2016 Indianapolis 500 race. Working with the support of the FIA's Women in Motorsport Commission, the all-female team set out to promote technology and engineering as a career for young women.\n\nLegge joined Michael Shank Racing in 2017 to drive an Acura NSX GT3 at the IMSA SportsCar Championship. In the 2019 24 Hours of Daytona Legge raced as part of an all-female team alongside Simona de Silvestro, Christina Nielsen and Ana Beatriz, having placed second in class the previous year. She was placed 15th in their class after Legge brushed a wall and damaged the car's suspension.\n\nLegge signed for the Amlin Aguri team to compete in the inaugural season of the Formula E electric open-wheel series. She raced in the first two races before being dropped for Salvador Durán.\n\nIn August 2018, Legge joined JD Motorsports for her NASCAR Xfinity Series debut at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, driving the No. 15 Chevrolet Camaro. As part of a two-race schedule with the team, she will also compete at Road America. Legge later announced her oval debut at Richmond Raceway.\n\nLegge is a member of the Women in Motorsport Commission of the FiA (Federation Internationale de l'Automobile).\n\n\n Season still in progress.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

Sometimes this is desirable either to improve the handling properties of an explosive (e.g. when munitions are filled in factories) or to reduce its sensitivity, brisance or detonation velocity. TNT explosive can itself be used to phlegmatize more sensitive explosives such as RDX (to form Cyclotol), HMX (to form Octol) or PETN (to form Pentolite). Other typical phlegmatizing agents include paraffin wax (5% used in OKFOL and Composition H6), paper or even water (used in water gel explosives). Such agents are nearly always flammable themselves (therefore adding fuel to the blast) or will at least boil off easily. Typically, a small amount of phlegmatizing agent is used e.g. Composition B, which has 1% paraffin wax added, or the Russian RGO hand grenade which contains 90 grams of \"A-IX-1\" explosive, comprising 96% RDX and 4% paraffin wax by weight. Another example of use is the VS-50 antipersonnel mine, which contains an explosive filling of 43 grams of RDX, again phlegmatized by combining it with 10% paraffin wax by weight.\n\nExplosive compounds may exist in material states that limit their application. For instance, nitroglycerin is normally an oily liquid. Phlegmatization of nitroglycerin allows it to be formed as a solid, commonly known as dynamite. It also allows the liquid, which is very sensitive to shock, to be handled more vigorously.\n"}

Durand had an attacking style, winning the Tour of Flanders in 1992 after a breakaway, and three stages in the Tour de France.\n\nDurand turned professional in 1990. He was national road champion in 1993 and 1994 and won Paris–Tours in 1998, the first French winner in 42 years. Durand rode seven Tours de France, finishing last in the 1999 race. In 1995 he was the surprise winner of the prologue, starting before it began raining. He wore the yellow jersey for two days. Durand won the combativity award in the 1998 and 1999 Tour de France; the latter year he also took the Lanterne Rouge. He retired at the end of 2004. He has since worked for Eurosport as a commentator.\n\nDurand was born to a poor farming family in the Mayenne region of northern France. He started racing in the \"minime\" class, the very youngest, but never won a race there or in the older \"cadet\" category. \"It's difficult to win as a kid when you're neither a climber nor a sprinter,\" he said. \"For me, the most beautiful jersey in the world is the French champion's. Yes, when they play the Marseillaise for you after a championship and then you go and show it off for three weeks in the Tour de France, the national flag on your shoulders, it's emotion and pleasure every day.\" As a senior, however, he won the national amateur team time-trial championship in 1988 with Laurent Bezault, Pascal Lino and Thierry Laurent. He turned professional in 1991.\n\nDurand became celebrated for long, lone attacks which sometimes succeeded but usually didn't. The French magazine, \"Vélo\", printed a monthly \"Jackymètre\" to log the kilometres ridden at the head of races during the course of the season. Durand said: \"Fortunately, in cycling, it's not always the best who wins, otherwise we wouldn't win so often.\"\n\nHis riding style was encouraged by his first directeur sportif, Cyrille Guimard. It brought him a seemingly suicidal win in the Tour of Flanders (\"see below\"). Guimard told him to attack early in the national championship at Châtellerault in 1993, to try his chance and to spoil those of Laurent Brochard and Luc Leblanc. The writer, Jean-François Quénet, said Guimard told Durand to attack far from the finish \"because he didn't want to see Laurent Brochard in blue, white and red and even less did he want a second consecutive title for Luc Leblanc, who was in disgrace in the Castorama team.\".\n\nOf the way he rode, Durand said:\n\nDurand won the Ronde van Vlaanderen, or Tour of Flanders, in 1992, 36 years after the last French winner, Jean Forestier, in 1956. He broke away from the field with Thomas Wegmüller after a quarter of the race, with 217 km still to ride. His success as an outsider, and after such a long lone ride, stayed in the memory of Belgian fans. Years later, Durand was stopped for speeding. The Belgian policeman who came to his car said, \"\"Vous avez gagné le Tour des Flandres en nonante-deux\"\" (\"You won the Tour of Flanders in '92\"\"\") - and let him drive on.\n\nDurand finished his career with Belgian teams. \"Winning the Ronde made me a bit of a naturalised Belgian,\" he said.\n\nDurand took drugs during the Tour de la Côte Picarde in 1996 and was given a one-month probationary suspension. He was disqualified during the Tour de France in 2002 for holding on to a car during the mountainous stage to the Plateau de Beille in the Pyrenees. There had been complaints from riders, including the Czech, Jan Svorada, that he had done the same the previous year.\n\nHis name was on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004.\n\nDurand retired from racing in 2005 after receiving no team offers. He followed that year's Tour de France as representative of the supermarket chain, Champion. He is now a television commentator for Eurosport.\n\nDurand stayed loyal to his first club, CC Renzé, throughout his career. He lives in Mauritius.\n\nOn 25 November 2017, Durand's 80-year-old father, Henri Durand, was reported missing by his wife, Colette, after he went out for his usual bicycle ride and never returned. His body was found in a lake on 2 January 2018, in between Ballots and Saint-Michel-de-la-Roë. An autopsy confirmed he had died from drowning.\n\n"}
{"id": "2277332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277332", "title": "Robert Doornbos", "text": "Robert Doornbos\n\nRobert Michael Doornbos (; born 23 September 1981) is a Dutch racing driver who also competed with a Monégasque licence. He has been test and third driver for the Jordan and Red Bull Racing Formula One teams, as well as driving for Minardi and Red Bull Racing in 2005 and 2006. Doornbos then drove for Minardi Team USA in the 2007 and final season of the Champ Car World Series. He competed in the Superleague Formula racing series in 2008, and drove for the Netherlands team in A1 Grand Prix's 2008–2009 season. In 2009, Doornbos competed in the IndyCar Series. He began the season with Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing, but switched to HVM Racing after the race in Kentucky Speedway.\n\nDoornbos's first sport was tennis. His interest in motorsport grew after he was invited to the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix as a guest of WilliamsF1. It was 1997 Formula One Champion Jacques Villeneuve who suggested that he should go for a series such as Formula Ford, as he was too big and too old to race karts. He gave up tennis and focused on racing, joining the JR racing team for the 1999 Opel Lotus UK Winter series. He had a successful season, finishing second in the championship after taking four pole positions, four fastest laps and four wins. In 2000, he competed in the Formula Ford Zetec Benelux series, finishing second in the Belgian championship and fifth overall with one pole, three fastest laps and six podiums.\n\nReturning to the UK in 2001, Doornbos contested the Scholarship class of the British Formula Three championship with FGR Racing. He finished the year fifth in the championship, taking two poles, two wins and nine podiums. He drew attention to himself with a second-place finish in the Formula Three support race to the British Grand Prix. He then moved to the German Formula Three championship with Team Ghinzani. He picked up four podiums, but no win. The year also featured a sixth-place finish in the prestigious Macau Grand Prix. Continuing with the team in 2003, Doornbos competed in the European Formula Three Championship, visiting the podium seven times. He took pole position at Spa-Francorchamps for the Formula Three Masters event, and finished second in Korea.\n\nWith support from Red Bull, Doornbos joined reigning International Formula 3000 champions Arden International for the 2004 FIA International Formula 3000 Championship. Partnered with Vitantonio Liuzzi, Doornbos claimed Rookie of the Year after finishing third in the championship. During the year, he took a fastest lap and four podium finishes, including a race win at Spa-Francorchamps.\n\nPrior to the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix, it was announced that Doornbos would be the official Friday test driver for the Jordan Formula One team, replacing Timo Glock, who had been promoted to race duties in place of Giorgio Pantano, whose sponsorship money had \"dried up\". Doornbos impressed as test driver for the final few races of the season, and was reappointed with the newly-sold Jordan team for the 2005 season.\nDoornbos completed Friday testing duties for Jordan in all but two of the first 11 events of the year, with French Renault F1 test driver Franck Montagny testing at the European Grand Prix, and Jordan being banned from using a third car at the Canadian Grand Prix after using too many tyres at the previous race.\n\nOn 19 July Doornbos was appointed as a Minardi race driver for the 2005 German Grand Prix onwards, replacing Austrian Patrick Friesacher, who had encountered sponsorship issues. In his first Formula One race, he collided with Jacques Villeneuve, the man who gave advice to Doornbos to start his career as a race driver. Doornbos raced a total of eight Grand Prix for the team, his best result being a 13th position in the Turkish and Belgian Grands Prix.\n\nDoornbos and teammate Christijan Albers would have become the first all-Dutch team line-up since Carel Godin de Beaufort and Ben Pon drove together for the Ecurie Maarsbergen team at the 1962 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort were it not for the fact that Doornbos raced with a Monegasque licence.\n\nEffectively, he would become Minardi's last Formula One driver, since the team was bought by Red Bull just before the Belgian Grand Prix.\n\nThe Minardi team ceased to exist in its previous form at the end of 2005, being bought out by Red Bull and becoming their Scuderia Toro Rosso team. Doornbos was unable to find a race drive for 2006, but Christian Horner, his former F3000 boss, had since been appointed as Sporting Director of Red Bull Racing, where he was appointed the team's test and reserve driver.\n\nHe thus spent most of 2006 testing at the racetracks on Fridays, ready to step into a race drive if either David Coulthard or Christian Klien were unable to race. In his role as the Red Bull test driver, he once more showed his talents as a racing driver. In the majority of the Grand Prix tests on Fridays, he was to be found in the top 10, and a number of times he achieved a top three time.\n\nAt the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix, he was involved in a controversial incident with Fernando Alonso, which resulted in the Spaniard incurring a two-second qualifying penalty.\n\nAfter the Italian Grand Prix, when Red Bull Racing announced that Klien had been dropped from the team, Doornbos was promoted to the second race driver role alongside Coulthard for the remaining three races. He entered with a bang by qualifying in the top 10 for his first race, in China. However, he touched Robert Kubica at the first corner during the race and the delay restricted him to 12th place at the finish.\n\nHe was subsequently signed as one of the team's test drivers for , alongside Michael Ammermüller, with Coulthard and Mark Webber taking the race seats.\n\nIn his role as Formula One test and racing driver, Robert Doornbos has given several demonstrations, both on tracks during other race events, as well as on public road. In the Netherlands, he has driven a Formula One car on public roads twice. In 2005, he was one of the drivers of the Monaco aan de Maas event in his hometown of Rotterdam. On 15 August 2006, he made the news with a fundraiser for the children of the 'Stichting Geluk en Vrijheid' (Foundation Happiness and Freedom). At a speed of 326 km/h (204 mph), he drove his Red Bull Formula One Car over the highway A7 on the Afsluitdijk in the Netherlands.\nAfter missing a racing seat for the 2007 Formula One season, Robert Doornbos signed a contract with Minardi Team USA for the 2007 Champ Car World Series season. He made a successful debut in the series in the first race of the season, the Vegas Grand Prix. After qualifying third, Doornbos finished on the podium, taking second place in the race. This made him the first rookie since Nigel Mansell in 1993 to make it to the podium in his first Champ Car race. A drive through penalty in 2007 Grand Prix of Cleveland quite possibly cost Robert a chance at his first Champ Car victory, but he still managed a fine second place behind Paul Tracy. One week later, however, Robert won the 2007 Mont-Tremblant Grand Prix in Canada and as a result took the joint lead of the championship with Sébastien Bourdais. After scoring this victory, the ESPN broadcast team dubbed him \"Bobby D\" – a nickname he reportedly enjoys. He later went on to win the 2007 San Jose Grand Prix after an accident during the first lap on turn one left him without his front wing. The accident inadvertently put him on an alternate pit strategy that he used to his advantage and secured the win. Although he impressed many fans and drivers alike with his personality and driving style, Doornbos would end up third in points at season's end, although he did win Roshfrans Rookie of the Year. After the merger of the CCWS and the Indy Car Series was announced for 2008, the Minardi half of the team elected not to take part, reducing HVM Racing to a one-car team. This left Doornbos without a drive for 2008.\n\nAfter failing to secure a seat with competitive teams in the unified IndyCar Series, and refusing to drive for uncompetitive teams, Doornbos opted to sit out the 2008 season in search for a competitive seat in 2009. It was announced on 21 May 2008 that Doornbos would drive for A.C. Milan in the Superleague Formula, a newly created racing series where the cars are sponsored by football clubs. The club's technical director is the son of Giancarlo Minardi, former owner of the Minardi Formula One team under its take over by Paul Stoddart. Doornbos finished third in the inaugural 2008 season.\n\nDoornbos contested the 2009 IndyCar Series season with Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing. Since he had no previous oval track racing experience, he has received coaching from fellow Dutchman Arie Luyendyk. Doornbos has finished no worse than 12th in his first three races but the highlight has been a second place start in his first oval track race at Kansas (helped by disqualifications of Dario Franchitti and Hélio Castroneves for dipping below the white line during qualifying). Lining up beside his teammate Graham Rahal, Newman/Haas/Lanigan cars formed the front row for the first time since Milwaukee in 2006. He took the lead after the first round of pit stops, but on that first stop under yellow he bumped a stationary tyre in the pit stall ahead of him. He was penalised to the rear of the field and was no longer a factor.\n\nOn 4 August 2009 Doornbos posted on his official website that he was leaving Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing effective immediately. He stated that there was the option for him to leave the team after 12 races and he decided to take it. He also said that he would like to stay in IndyCar and would announce his future plans shortly.\n\nOn 5 August 2009 Doornbos signed with HVM Racing in the IndyCar Series for the remainder of the 2009 and to drive for the team through 2010, however this did not happen.\n\nDoornbos co-founded Kiiroo, a Dutch company involved in the production of sex toys.\n\nHe is now active as a Formula 1 studio analyst for the Dutch F1 broadcaster Ziggo Sport.\n\n Did not finish the race, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.\n\n† Non Championship round\n\n"}
{"id": "2277335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277335", "title": "Hurontario Street", "text": "Hurontario Street\n\nHurontario Street is a roadway running in Ontario, Canada between Lake Ontario at Mississauga and Lake Huron's Georgian Bay at Collingwood. Within Peel Region, it is a major urban thoroughfare within the cities of Mississauga and Brampton, which serves as the divide from which cross-streets are split into \"East\" and \"West\", except at its foot in the historic Mississauga neighbourhood of Port Credit. Farther north, with the exception of the section through Simcoe County, where it forms the 8th Concession, it is the meridian for the rural municipalities it passes through. In Dufferin County, for instance, parallel roads are labelled as \"EHS\" or \"WHS\" for East (or West) of Hurontario Street.\n\nProvincial Highway 10 follows the road through Caledon as far north as Orangeville. The highway designation formerly continued south through Brampton and Mississauga, but the highway was downloaded through both cities in 1997 due to its increasingly urbanized nature and the presence of the 400-series Highways 410 and 403. Highway 24 followed much of the street's northern section (as well as the central section where it ran concurrently with Highway 10) from near Glen Huron to Collingwood, but was also downloaded (to Simcoe County), as it was deemed by the province to be of insufficient importance to be retained in the highway system, and is now known as Simcoe County Road 124 through that stretch.\n\nIn addition to these two highways that followed most of its course, Highways 7 and 26 jogged along it for short distances through Brampton and Collingwood, respectively, before being rerouted.\nThe street's name is a portmanteau of its two terminating Great Lakes; Huron and Ontario. However, most of the street was alternately named Centre Road, due to its role as a divider for much of its length, and still is today in parts. Within the central part of Brampton, the road is named Main Street. In the Townships of Mulmur and Clearview, the road is bypassed and breaks up and has several names; Centre Road, Lavender Hill Road, and Nottawasaga Concession 8. In addition, two parts form short sections of diagonal roads through this area. \n\nIn the cities of Mississauga and Brampton (with the exception of the latter's central area),\nthe street is still colloquially referred to by traffic reporters, and even by residents, as \"Highway 10\" rather than by its street names, despite the high degree of urbanization and the fact that the provincial highway designation is defunct in these cities. A prime example of this is the common reference to the street's intersection with Dundas Street as \"5 and 10\". The most likely reason for this is the fact that Mississauga is not a traditional city, but was established much later as a reincorporation of the rural Toronto Township, thus the road never had a history of being urbanized prior to receiving its highway designation, resulting in continued use of the highway number out of habit. Some businesses use the number in their names, and even the Ministry of Transportation's traffic camera website continues to identify the street as \"Hwy 10\", as does some signage at the Hurontario & 407 Park and Ride lot and transit terminal. However, the street name predominates in Collingwood.\n\nOne result of the use of the terminology is the frequent conflation of Hurontario St. as corresponding to the entire length of Highway 10 to Owen Sound, due to the highway's northern terminus being in that city, which is coincidentally also situated on Lake Huron's Georgian Bay (See diagram above on left for route comparison).\n\nHurontario Street was created in 1818 by incorporating the combination of the 8th Concession leading south from the harbour on Georgian Bay that later became the site of Collingwood, and the southern part of the Toronto-Sydenham Road, which ran between Sydenham and Toronto Township (present and former Highway 10 between Owen Sound and Mississauga), effectively creating a branched interlake route. As previously mentioned, parts were also alternatively called \"Centre Road\". That name continued to be used interchangeably at least until the 1950s, and a section bypassed by former Highway 24 is officially named Centre Road today.\n\nDuring the construction of the interchange with the Highway 410 extension and Valleywood Boulevard, Hurontario Street was temporarily diverted onto an alternative alignment. After work was complete this road section was bypassed and renamed Hutchinson Farm Lane.from August 2007 to November 16, 2009.\n\nMississauga and Brampton\n\nHurontario then enters Brampton, where it changes name to Main Street after crossing Steeles Avenue. Main St. runs alongside the Etobicoke Creek valley until reaching Brampton's downtown, where it passes landmarks such as Gage Park, Brampton City Hall, and the Rose Theatre Brampton. At Bovaird Drive (formerly Highway 7), the name Hurontario resumes, and the street passes through a lengthy mixed residential/industrial rural-urban fringe zone until it reaches Highway 410 at Brampton's northern city limits.\nCaledon to Collingwood\n\nAt Highway 410, the Highway 10 designation begins as the street enters rural Caledon, and it has a discontinuity through the interchange as it defaults onto Valleywood Boulevard northbound and the 410 southbound, with ramps connecting the two sections. The road continues northward as the undivided four-lane Highway 10 until reaching Orangeville, where the highway leaves the Hurontario Street alignment to head for the City of Owen Sound, although it parallels it very closely for 21 km. (13 mi.) as it follows First Line WHS. The reason for the highway's chosen alignment was due to old Orangeville's location farther to the west and (in the case of the former Highway 24 segment to the north), difficult terrain through the Niagara Escarpment. In Orangeville, it runs as a residential side street and breaks at the Orangeville Reservoir. In Mono, it resumes as a minor sideroad to Highway 89, where it breaks again. It picks up again north of Boyne Valley Provincial Park through Mulmur and Clearview townships as a series of broken minor roads with several names (including its historic alternate name; Centre Rd.), running through the hamlets of Dunedin and Glen Huron. North of Glen Huron, it becomes a major road again as it joins Simcoe County Road 124 (which, along with Highway 10, carries the Orangeville-Collingwood through traffic south of this point), until its terminus in Collingwood at Side Launch Way, one block north of First and Huron Streets (Highway 26). The final block is a short one-way northbound extension built in 2009 to serve a residential redevelopment project on the site once occupied by the now-closed Collingwood Shipyards.\n\nHurontario St. is one of the busiest transit corridors in the 905 Region of the Greater Toronto Area. Mississauga and Brampton each run separate systems, but routes cross city boundaries. In addition to local routes operated by both cities, Brampton Transit operates a rudimentary bus rapid transit line along it, branded as \"Züm\", and Mississauga's MiWay runs a limited-stop express bus route. The MiWay express bus and the southern portion of Zűm are slated to be replaced by a proposed light rail transit line that is to be constructed along the street in Mississauga and a short distance in Brampton (see Hurontario LRT). The project\nhas received funding approval by the Government of Ontario.\nIt is currently in the design phase and construction is projected to begin by late 2018.\n\nIn Caledon, GO Transit runs a commuter bus route along the road to Orangeville from Brampton's downtown bus terminal. There is also partial service along the street in Collingwood, provided by Colltrans.\n\nThe base trunk routes serving the street are:\n\nMississauga (MiWay):\n\nBrampton (Brampton Transit):\n\nCaledon (GO Transit)\n\nCollingwood (Colltrans)\n\nThe East Route operates along Hurontario for part of its run.\n\nAttractions and institutions along Hurontario Street in urban Peel Region include (south to north):\n\n\nCaledon to Collingwood:\n\n"}

While working the land he also found himself employed in the printing offices of the time. Aleks Çaçi finished the Trade School of Vlora and the Institute of High Trade (business would be the equivalent of today) in Greece. After the liberation of Albania from fascism he completed the school of the regime \"Vladimir Ilic Lenin\". He was among the early and young authors of the realist literature, or socialist realist as it was later dubbed of the 30s, as well as a member of the Communist Group of Korça.\n\nAs a result of his revolutionary activities as well as his writings, in 1936 he was isolated in the city of Berat for two years by King Zogu's regime. Çaçi was an active member of the war for independence from foreign oppression. Since the early days of the organization he worked in the editing group of \"Kushtrimi i Lirise\"\"(Battle cry of Freedom)\" where he published many articles, poems and prizes. Aleks Çaçi was also in charge of another newspaper, \"Trumpeta Clirimtare\" \"(The Freedom Trumpet)\" that used to be published in wartime in the Kurvelesh region in south Albania.\n\nAfter the war he worked in many newspapers and literary magazines. He spent many years in China as writer and publicist during the time when Albania had close relationships with Maoist China. For work and creative merits Çaçi was awarded by the Congress of that time with the order of \"Flamuri i Kuq i Punes\"\"(Red flag of Work)\" of the First Degree. He published many books and worked in \"Lidhia e Shkrimtareve\" \"(The league of writers)\" until his death in 1989. Towards the 1980s he retired in a smart fashion from the political life in Albania which was eating countless intellectual heads for the pleasures of Enver Hoxha. This was a time of instability with the political assassinations and/or suicides and mass arrests of intellectual figures that plagued the country in the 1980s. During the last 15 years of his life he detached himself from the political arena as the corruption became rampant and the ideals of communism crumbled under the weight of ruthless dictatorship.\n\nWith his friends he translated many books from Ancient Greek, Modern Greek and Italian into Albanian. He is widely known in Greece and Italy and his figure is an example of an Albanian intellectual and patriot that is revered in all that area which few people have managed to do.

It also is a primary component of a horse harness.\n\nA basic surcingle is unpadded, attaches around the horse by means of buckles or rings, and has no other hardware. A training surcingle, sometimes called a \"roller,\" has many extra rings attached, running from the ribcage up to the withers area. It usually has padding to relieve pressure on the horse's spine. A variation of this design is used for equestrian vaulting.\n\nMany trainers first teach a young horse to accept girth pressure by strapping on a surcingle before a saddle and girth. The surcingle is commonly used for longeing, often as a base from which to attach training equipment such as side reins, overcheck, lauffer reins (sliding side reins), or chambons. A surcingle is also important in long lining or ground driving, as it provides rings for the long reins to run through. Double longeing, using two longe lines, requires the use of a surcingle to thread the longe lines through the rings.\n\nCompared to a saddle, a surcingle allows more precise adjustment of side reins due to the placement of additional rings. While a saddle only provides one height to attach the rings (the girth buckles), and can be uneven or at the wrong position, a training surcingle places rings at more appropriate locations for ground work. Many surcingle designs allow the side reins to be attached at several different heights along the sides of the horse.\n\nWhen used without a saddle, a surcingle sits just behind the withers. When used with a saddle, the surcingle runs over the seat near the pommel. A surcingle is also used over the top of certain types of pack saddle and pack to keep the pack bags and swag in place. A surcingle is usually used with a pad, and fit to the horse's back as carefully as a saddle would be. It is tightened enough to prevent slipping, more when used with a saddle and rider, less when used for ground training.\n\n\n"}

It was established on 1 July 1843 through the amalgamation of a number of existing regional banks and headquartered in Madras (now Chennai). It was merged with the other Presidency banks in 1921 to form the Imperial Bank of India, which later became the State Bank of India.\n\nIn 1683, Governor William Gyfford (1681–1687) and his Council in Madras established a bank. In 1805, Governor Sir William Bentinck convened a Finance Committee that recommended the formation of a First government bank in India; the Madras Bank, which was sometimes called the Government Bank amalgamated Lord Krishna Bank, began functioning from 1 February 1806. It initially functioned from the Exchange Building—the building housing the present Fort Museum—within Fort St. George.\n\nThe Bank of Madras was formed in 1843 as a joint stock company with a capital of Rupees 3 million by the amalgamation of Madras Bank, Carnatic Bank (1788), the British Bank of Madras (1795), and the Asiatic Bank (1804). Bank of Madras had a branch network spread into all the major cities and trade centers of South India, including Bangalore, Coimbatore, Madurai, Mangalore, Calicut, Tellicherry, Cochin, Alleppy, Cocanada, Guntur, Masulipatnam, Ootacamund, Nagapatnam, and Tuticorin. It also had a branch in Colombo, British Ceylon, now called Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Bank of Madras undertook all the normal activities that are common to a commercial bank. The Bank of Madras, in the absence of any central banking authority during that time, also conducted certain functions that are ordinarily a preserve of a central bank. It also issued banknotes in the Madras Presidency. These included managing the banking business of the Presidency of Madras and offices of the colonial government of India located in South India, and managing the Public Debt Office of the Government of Madras.\n\nThe head office of the Bank of Madras was shifted to a new building, on South Beach Road, Madras, in 1897. The site was acquired for 100,000 in 1895, building was designed by Col. Samuel Jacob, and suitably modified and adapted by Henry Irwin (1841–1922), and constructed by Namperumal Chetty, a reputed builder, for 300,000. The building is an exquisite example of Victorian architecture. Currently, the building houses several offices of State Bank of India, including its main city office.\n\nThe Bank of Madras merged with the two other Presidency banks—the Bank of Calcutta and the Bank of Bombay—on 27 January 1921 and the reorganized banking entity took on the name Imperial Bank of India. In 1955, the Reserve Bank of India, which is the central banking organization of India, acquired a controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India. On 30 April 1955, the Imperial Bank of India became the State Bank of India.\n\n\n\n"}

Leslie\n\nHarry Guyer Leslie (April 6, 1878December 10, 1937) was an Indiana Republican Party politician, speaker of the state house and the 33rd Governor of the state. His term as governor was marked by the start of the Great Depression.\n\nHarry G. Leslie was born in West Lafayette, Indiana, on April 6, 1878 to Daniel and Mary Burkhart Leslie. His father was a local politician and served a chief of police for the town. While still a boy, his family moved into the country outside of the town. He attended public schools and worked delivering groceries as a teenager. In 1898 he was elected town clerk, a year after he graduated.\n\nHe soon enrolled in the recently constructed Purdue University where he was a member of the Sigma Pi fraternity and Acacia fraternity. While at Purdue, Leslie was captain of both the school's football and baseball teams and became one of the school's \"immortal\" players. As one of the school's star players, his team was on course to win the state championship in 1903. On October 31 he and his teammates took a train from Lafayette to Indianapolis to a match against Indiana University. As the train neared the 18th Street crossing in Indianapolis, it collided with another train, and Leslie's coach was shattered. One member of the team miraculously landed on his feet and was unharmed after being thrown out a window. The other eighteen boys, including Leslie, were pronounced dead at the scene and taken to the morgue.\n\nA few hours later at the morgue, as the morticians prepared to embalm his body, they discovered he still had a pulse and immediately rushed him to the hospital. Barely alive, he needed several operations and edged on death for several weeks. His recovery was slow, but he eventually regained his health, although he walked with the aid of a cane for the remainder of his life. He returned to school at the end of 1904 and after another year he graduated. His survival of the \"Purdue Wreck\" received significant attention across the state and he became a famous folk hero.\n\nIn 1904, Leslie founded the Purdue College Republicans. For a number of years in the 1990s and early 2000s, the Purdue chapter held a \"Leslie Day\" celebration and fundraiser in his honor.\n\nLeslie graduated from the Indiana Law School in 1907. He opened a law office in Lafayette the year he graduated and took a position at a local high school coaching football. There he met Martha Morgan, whom he married on August 16, 1910, and by whom he had three sons, Jack, Richard, and Robert. Leslie became involved in local politics and was elected as a Republican Tippecanoe County treasurer in 1912. He purchased a farm in 1914, but disliking the labor, he sold the farm and bought stock in a local bank at which he served as president until 1924.\n\nIn 1923 Leslie, aided by his popularity, was elected to represent Tippecanoe and Warren County in the Indiana House of Representatives. He became known for his down-to-earth style of speaking, and quickly made many allies in the body. He was reelected twice, and served through 1929. In 1925 he was elected Speaker of the House, and remained in that position until he left the body. His term as Speaker was dominated by the Indiana Ku Klux Klan. Their leader was arrested and convicted of rape and murder in 1925, and over the next two years many other Klansman were exposed and forced out of office on a host of charges—including nearly half the members of the General Assembly. The Klan had supported him in his bid for the speakership primarily because they opposed his rival candidate. Leslie fought the Klan block on several issues, including committee assignments, legislation aimed at eliminating Catholic schools, and other issues.\n\nLeslie was pleased with the Grand Dragon's conviction and the collapse in Klan power. He personally believed he was innocent of the charges but thought he deserved prison because of his many unknown crimes. Among the causes Leslie championed was the creation of the Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis.\n\nLeslie ran for the governor's nomination in the 1928 Republican primary. Among the five candidates, no one took a majority and the nomination went to the state convention. Leslie won on the fifth ballot and defeated the Democratic major of Indianapolis, Frank Daily, and was elected with 51.3% if the vote. He was the state's fifth consecutive Republican governor.\n\nOne of his first acts as governor was to support legislation to repeal the state's 1915 primary election laws, and return candidate selections to state conventions. The measure was approved in 1929, and much to the disappointment of the Klan. The first part of Leslie's term was a period of economic growth and he hosted several high-profile events, including the National Governors Association, a visit by President Herbert Hoover, Charles Lindbergh, and other famous guests.\n\nThe Great Depression began in 1929, and was complicated by a drought in the state. He instituted some relief measures, but largely did nothing significant believing that the Depression would soon end. In 1932 he called a special session of the General Assembly to lower taxes. Among the relief legislation passed by the General Assembly was Indiana's first old-age pension act, but Leslie vetoed it. As the Depression continued, Leslie decided more needed to be done. He began hiring unemployed workers to work on state road projects. He also advocated that his program be duplicated by the federal government, and his plan was soon implemented as the WPA. Among Leslie's other projects was continuing to grow the state park system.\n\nFollowing his governorship Leslie became a founder, and eventually the president, of Standard Life Insurance Company in Indianapolis. Leslie enjoyed humor and among his close friends were George Ade and Will Rogers. While visiting Ade in Miami, Leslie died unexpectedly from heart disease on December 10, 1937. His remains were returned to Indianapolis where he lay in state before being moved to Lafayette for a funeral and burial.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "2277450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277450", "title": "French conjugation", "text": "French conjugation\n\nFrench conjugation is the creation of derived forms of a French verb from its principal parts by inflection. French verbs are conventionally divided into three conjugations (\"conjugaisons\") with the following grouping:\n\nThe first two groups follow a regular conjugation, whereas the third group follows an irregular one. The third group is considered a closed-class conjugation form, meaning that most new verbs introduced to the French language are of the first group (\"téléviser, atomiser, radiographier\"), with the remaining ones being of the second group (\"alunir\").\n\nThe verb \"aller\" is the only verb ending in -er belonging to the third group.\n\nThere are seven different moods in French conjugation: indicative (\"indicatif\"), subjunctive (\"subjonctif\"), conditional (\"conditionnel\"), imperative (\"impératif\"), infinitive (\"infinitif\"), participle (\"participe\"), and gerund (\"gérondif\"). The infinitive, participle, and gerundive are not verbal moods.\n\nTenses are described under the mood to which they belong, and they are grouped as follows. Other tenses are constructed through the use of an auxiliary verb:\n\n\nThere are two auxiliary verbs in French: \"avoir\" (to have) and \"être\" (to be), used to conjugate compound tenses according to these rules:\n\n\nCompound tenses are conjugated with an auxiliary followed by the past participle, ex: \"j'ai fait\" (I did), \"je suis tombé\" (I fell). When \"être\" is used, the participle is inflected according to the gender and number of the subject. The participle is inflected with the use of the verb \"avoir\" according to the direct object, but only if the direct object precedes the participle, ex:\n\nAs stand-alone verbs, the conjugation of the two auxiliaries is listed in the table below:\n\nThis verb has different stems for different tenses. These are imperfect \"av-\" ; present subjunctive \"ai-\" ; future and conditional \"aur-\" ; simple past and past subjunctive \"e-\" (not pronounced: \"eus, eusse\" are pronounced as bare inflections ). Although the stem changes, the inflections of these tenses are as a regular \"-oir\" verb.\n\nIn the present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Notice that the imperative form uses the subjunctive conjugation.\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nThis verb has different stems for different tenses. These are all pronounced differently: imperfect \"ét-\" ; present subjunctive \"soi-\" ; future and conditional \"ser-\" ; simple past and past subjunctive in \"f-\" . The inflections of these tenses are as a regular \"-oir\" verb (that is, as an \"-re\" verb but with the vowel \"u\" in the \"f-\" forms). For example, subjunctive \"soyons, soyez\" is pronounced with the \"y\" sound () of other \"-re\" and \"-oir\" verbs.\n\nIn the simple present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The imperative form uses the subjunctive conjugation.\n\nThe non-finite forms use the stem \"êt-\" (before a consonant)/\"ét-\" (before a vowel):\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nFrench verbs ending in \"-er\", which constitute the largest class, inflect somewhat differently from other verbs. Between the stem and the inflectional endings that are common across most verbs, there may be a vowel, which in the case of the \"-er\" verbs is a silent \"-e-\" (in the simple present singular), \"-é\" or \"-ai\" (in the past participle and the \"je\" form of the simple past), and \"-a-\" (in the rest of simple past singular and in the past subjunctive). In addition, the orthographic \"-t\" found in the \"-ir\" and \"-re\" verbs in the singular of the simple present and past is not found in this conjugation, so that the final consonants are \"-Ø\", \"-s\", \"-Ø\" rather than \"-s\", \"-s\", \"-t.\"\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\"\n\nExceptional contexts:\n\nExceptional verbs:\n\nThe \"-ir\" verbs differ from the \"-er\" verbs in the following points:\nNon-finite forms:\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\" (\"partir\" uses \"être\")\n\nThe third group involves mostly verbs that end in -re and a few -ir verbs and the verb aller. There are numerous irregularities in this group with several different conjugation paradigms, for example several verbs that end in -ire have similar endings. The verb perdre and its endings are frequently presented as an example for the third group conjugations. See the irregular verb section for more details.\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"avoir\" (a few 3rd group verbs use \"etre\")\n\nMost irregular French verbs can be described with seven principal parts. In reality, few if any verbs have separate stems for all seven parts; instead, they tend to \"inherit\" the same stem as another part. Note that the endings for these verbs are basically the same as for regular \"-ir\" verbs; in fact, regular \"-ir\" verbs can be fit into this scheme by treating the \"-iss-\" variants as different principal parts.\n\nThe following table shows how the paradigm of an irregular verb is constructed from its principal parts. Note that a few verbs construct the present indicative (especially the singular) differently.\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nThe following table gives principal parts for a number of irregular verbs. There are a number of fair-sized groups of verbs that are conjugated alike; these are listed first. There are some additional irregularities in the present indicative, which are listed below. Nearly all irregularities affect the singular, and are purely issues of spelling. (Stems that are irregular in the sense of being unpredictable by the above rules are given in boldface.)\n\nThe following table shows an example paradigm of one of these verbs, \"recevoir\" \"to receive\".\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nNine verbs also have an irregular subjunctive stem, used at least for the singular and third plural of the present subjunctive. These verbs can be said to have 11 principal parts, because the subjunctive stem may or may not be used for the first and second plural present subjunctive, the imperative and/or the present participle, in ways that vary from verb to verb.\n\nThe following table shows how the paradigm of an 11-principal-part irregular verb is constructed from its principal parts. Note that these verbs are generally the most irregular verbs in French, and many of them construct the present indicative (especially the singular) in an idiosyncratic fashion. The verb \"aller\" also constructs its past participle and simple past differently, according to the endings for \"-er\" verbs.\n\nNon-finite forms:\n\nThe following table gives the principal parts for the 11-principal-part verbs. (Stems that are irregular in the sense of being unpredictable by the above rules are given in boldface.)\n\nThe verb \"aller\" means \"to go\" and is sufficiently irregular that it merits listing its conjugation in full. It is the only verb with the first group ending \"er\" to have an irregular conjugation. It belongs to none of the three sections of the third group, and is often categorized on its own.\nThe verb has different stems for different tenses. These are all pronounced differently: past \"all-\" (simple past, imperfect, past subjunctive); present subjunctive \"aill-\" ; conditional and future \"ir-\" . The inflections of these tenses are completely regular, and pronounced as in any other \"-er\" verb. However, in the simple present, not only are there stem changes, but the inflections are irregular as well:\n\nThe non-finite forms are all based on \"all-\" :\n\nAuxiliary verb: \"être\"\n\n1. In an interrogative sentence, the final \"e\" is written \"é\" (traditional spelling) or \"è\" (rectified spelling), and is pronounced as an open \"è\" . Additionally, the \"e\" in \"je\" becomes silent. For example: je marche (I walk), marchè-je? (do I walk?)\n\n2. Only in \"je/tu peux\" (I/you can), \"je/tu veux\" (I/you want), and \"je/tu vaux\" (I am/you are 'worth').\n\n. Verbs in \"-dre\" have a final \"d\" for the 3rd singular person, except for those ending in \"-indre\" and \"-soudre\" which take a final \"t\". The verbs \"vaincre\" (defeat) and \"convaincre\" (convince) are conjugated as \"vainc\" and \"convainc\", respectively, in 3rd singular person.\n\n3. The only verbs having this ending are: \"assaillir\" (assail), \"couvrir\" (cover), \"cueillir\" (pluck), \"défaillir\" (default), \"offrir\" (offer), \"ouvrir\" (open), \"souffrir\" (suffer), \"tressaillir\" (shiver), and in the imperative only, \"avoir\" (have), \"savoir\" (know), and \"vouloir\" (want).\n\n4. Except for \"je vins\" (I came), \"je tins\" (I held), etc..., \"que je vinsse\" (that I come), \"que je tinsse\" (that I hold), etc...\n\n\n\n"}

She is a Guggenheim fellow in composition and her recent works include the development of \"komungobot\" (algorithmic robotic instrument) and solo performances of the world's only electric \"komungo\" with live interactive MIDI computer system in her large-scale multimedia performance pieces.\n\nKim has received commissions from the American Composers Orchestra, Kronos Quartet, and Tan Dun's New Generation of East for Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, among others.\n\nDuring the last three decades Kim has performed as a \"komungo\" soloist in her own compositions at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Kennedy Center (Washington, D.C.), Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art (Washington, DC), Metropolitan Museum of Art, Asia Society (NYC), Haus der Kulturen der Welt (Berlin), and for collaborative improvisations at Royal Festival Hall (London), Venice Biennale, Moers Festival (Germany) and many significant international festivals throughout the USA, Europe, Canada, Latin America, South America, Russia, Asia, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\nShe began studies of traditional Korean music in South Korea in 1973, at her father's recommendation. She received a full scholarship to study at South Korea's first National High School for Korean Traditional Music (국립국악고등학교), one of 60 students accepted in the first year. The school was established under Ministry of Culture in association with the prestigious National Gugak Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts (국립국악원). There, she practiced court orchestra music, learned both court and folk styles of singing (가곡 kagok, 판소리 pansori, 민요 folk song), drumming (장고 janggo) and bamboo flutes (단소 danso, 소금 sogeum), and selected the \"geomungo\" (거문고, a six feet long board zither with sixteen frets and six silk strings that are plucked with a thin bamboo stick) as her major instrument. Her selection of the instrument was audacious; dating to the fourth century, the \"geomungo\" had been favored particularly by male Confucian scholars, and was generally not played by women. Upon graduation she received Ministry of Culture's Outstanding Student Award (문화공보부장관상). She continued her studies with Korea's leading ethnomusicologists earning a B.A. degree in Korean traditional music theory and composition from Seoul National University in 1980. Upon graduation she received an award for rising new musicians and her composition was premiered for KBS-TV national broadcasting.\n\nInterested in learning more about the musics of other cultures but aware that this would not be possible in Korea, Kim emigrated in August 1980 to the United States, where she immersed herself in world music. She first attended the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and studied composition with John Adams for one year then transferred to Mills College in Oakland, California, where she studied with Lou Harrison, Terry Riley, David Rosenboom, and Larry Polansky and received an MFA in electronic music and recording media in 1985. She was awarded Paul Merrit Henry Prize upon graduation.\n\nWhile in California, she also studied the Chinese \"guqin\" (an ancient 7-stringed zither) and Indian \"bansuri\" (bamboo flute) from G. S. Sachdev, and began to investigate the possibility of cross-cultural creative music.\n\nDuring the 1980s, she regularly attended the New Music America festival, where she met many noted contemporary composers including John Cage, La Monte Young, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, Lou Harrison, Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Joan La Barbara, Morton Subotnick, Meredith Monk, Joseph Celli, Malcolm Goldstein, David Moss, Elliott Sharp, John Zorn and many others. From 1982 to 1988, she worked as a correspondent, interviewing and writing over 30 articles about those contemporary American composers for \"Eumak Dong-A\", a Korean monthly music magazine published by the \"Dong-A Daily News.\"\n\nPlunged into the American avant-garde music scene, she was invited to the Composer-to-Composer festival directed by Charles Amirkhanian in Telluride, Colorado in 1989 and joined the one-week residency with John Cage and selected leading composers.\n\nKim premiered her commissioned works predominately in New York City and travels worldwide performing. Kim lives in Connecticut and teaches in the Music Department at Wesleyan University.\n\nJin Hi Kim's primary instrument is the \"geomungo\", though she also plays Korean percussion instruments such as \"janggo\" and \"dancer’s barrel drum set\". With the Toronto instrument builder Joseph Yanuziello in 1998 Kim co-designed and now plays the electric \"komungo\", for which she has created numerous interactive pieces with a MIDI computer system using MAX/MSP programmed by Alex Noyes. In collaboration with Alex Noyes Kim is developing \"komungobot\", an algorithmic robotic instrument.\n\nKim has released 15 CDs, including \"Living Tones\", \"Komungo\", \"Pulses\", \"Komunguitar\", \"Sargeng\", \"No World Improvisations\", and \"Sound Universe\".\n\nJin Hi Kim's compositions for Korean and Western instruments (both alone and in combination) have as their central focus the exploration of the Korean concept of \"shigimse\" (시김새), the technique of ornamentation used in traditional vocal and instrumental music. Although the term's literal meaning is not known, in 1985 Kim began to use the term \"living tones\" to describe this attitude toward melodic material as she applied it in her work. Thus, her compositions use newly developed forms of notation to indicate various types of vibrato, pitch bends, etc. in order that, as in Korean traditional music, each musical tone is given a unique expression and development. Kim's Living Tones CD features her signature bi-cultural compositions \"Nong Rock\" for string quartet and \"komungo,\" \"Tchong\" for flute and \"daegum, Piri Quartet\" for oboe/English horn with three \"piri\"(s) and \"Yoeum\" for \"kagok\" singer and baritone.\n\nIn 1986 she began to be recognized as a composer when she was commissioned by the Kronos Quartet for her work \"Linking\". Jin Hi Kim is both composer and soloist for the following compositions: \"Nong Rock\" for the Kronos Quartet premiered at Alice Tully Hall\",\" Lincoln Center in 1992; \"Voices of Sigimse\" for Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center premiered at the Lincoln Center Summer Festival 1996 with Tan Dun conducting; \"Eternal Rock\" (2001) for American Composers Orchestra premiered at Carnegie Hall; and \"Tilings\" (2013) for Either/Or Ensemble conducted by Richard Carrick premiered at The Kitchen (NYC).\n\nKim also has introduced Korean tall and colorful barrel drums in the orchestra. \"Eternal Rock II\" (2006) was commissioned and premiered by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, conducted by Gil Rose with Gerry Hemingway as soloist on drums. \"Monk Dance\" (2007) was commissioned and premiered by the New Haven Symphony Orchestra with Kim as soloist on the drums and Jung-Ho Pak conducting. Kim was Music Alive Composer-in-Residence with New Haven Symphony Orchestra (2009-2011) for which she premiered her commissioned \"Nori III\" for electric \"komungo\" and percussion quartet.\n\nIn 1998 Kim was featured composer for the Festival Nieuwe Muziek and \"Agate Slice\" was commissioned for Xenakis Ensemble (the Netherlands). Kim also performed her compositions as soloist with Empire State Youth Orchestra, Stanford Symphony, KBS Symphony (Korea), Zeitgeist, and Kairos String Quartet (Berlin).\n\nResponding to two wars involving American military in Asia, Jin Hi Kim composed two pieces, \"Child of War\" (2014) and \"One Sky\" (2005). A mixed choral piece, \"Child of War\" was dedicated to Kim Phuc who is renowned for ‘the girl in the picture' during the Vietnam War, was commissioned by John Marshall Lee and world premiered by The Mendelssohn Choir of Connecticut and Kim, conducted by Carole Ann Maxwell at Quick Center, Fairfield University. \"One Sky\" (2005), for chamber string orchestra and electric \"komungo,\" is dedicated to the reunification of North and South Korea, which was commissioned and performed by the Great Mountain Music Festival Orchestra, with Kim as soloist, at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ); Kim was featured on BBC The World/Global Hit radio program directed by Marco Werman for her \"One Sky\"; and the work was broadcast on KBS TV.\n\nIn collaboration with artist David Chung at the University of Michigan, Kim composed two soundtracks: \"Pyongyang\", a multimedia installation, and \"Koryo Saram\", an hour long documentary film about Korean refugees from Russia to Kazakhstan which was presented at Harvard University, Princeton University, Smithsonian Institution Freer Gallery of Art, and the Sackler Gallery (Washington, DC) and international film festivals including Sãn Paulo International Film Festival, Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival, San Francisco Asian American International Film Festival, Vancouver Asian Film Festival and European Film Festival.\n\nKim has created hour-long cross-cultural multimedia works that led to a new direction incorporating Asian cultural heritage interfaced with emerging Western interactive technology. \n\nIn 1986 Kim met Henry Kaiser and was quickly introduced to many other leading guitarists in the United States and Europe. Since then, she has improvised at many international festivals with Elliott Sharp, Bill Frisell, Derek Bailey, Hans Reichel, Eugene Chadbourne, James Newton, Evan Parker, Joseph Celli, Malcolm Goldstein, Oliver Lake, Billy Bang, William Parker, Leroy Jenkins, Peter Kowald, Reggie Workman, Mark Dresser, Joëlle Léandre, Jane Ira Bloom, Rüdiger Carl, Gerry Hemingway, and many other prominent figures in new music and avant-garde jazz.\n\nFor her own compositions and for collective creativity, she has improvised with traditional master artists from Asia and Africa including Kongar-Ol Ondar, Min Xiao-Fen, Wu Man, Samir Chatterjee, Mayumi Miyata, Vikku Vinayakram, Abraham Adzenyah, and Mor Thiam.\n\nKim received a 2001 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award, which was created by John Cage and Jasper Johns. She is a recipient of the composer fellowship from Guggenheim Foundation, American Composers Orchestra, National Endowment for the Arts, MAP fund from Rockefeller Foundation, McKnight Visiting Composer, Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust, Meet The Composer, Wolff Ebermann Prize of International Theater Institute, and Connecticut Commission on the Arts. She received the artist residence fellowship for the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center (Italy), Asian Cultural Council to Japan and Indonesia, Fulbright Special Project to Vietnam, Djerassi Foundation (California), Composers Now Creative Residencies (Pocantico Center of Rockefeller Brothers Fund), and Freeman Artist-In-Residence at Cornell University.\n\nAn autobiography, \"Komungo Tango\" covering her 25-year performing career, was published (in the Korean language) in 2007.\n\nA retrospective interview about Kim's major works was archived in \"Oral History of American Music\" at Yale University Library.\n\nKim is featured in \"Free Music Production (FMP)-In Retrospect\", published in Berlin, Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1944, he married Josephine Robinson of Allendale, South Carolina. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, having been awarded a Bronze Star. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree in 1947 at the University of South Carolina, where he was a member of the Euphradian Society. He received a law degree at the same school in 1948. While attending USC, McNair served as the first Governor of the South Carolina Student Legislature and was initiated into the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He practiced law in Moncks Corner and Allendale, South Carolina, from which he was elected in 1950 to the South Carolina House of Representatives. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1962, then succeeded Donald S. Russell in 1965 when Russell resigned with the understanding that McNair would appoint him to a then-vacant United States Senate seat.\nMcNair won the 1966 general election over State Representative Joseph O.

{"id": "2277483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277483", "title": "California State Lottery", "text": "California State Lottery\n\nThe California State Lottery (also known as the California Lottery) is the lottery system of the U.S. state of California. It began on November 6, 1984, after California voters passed Proposition 37, the California State Lottery Act of 1984, to authorize the creation of a lottery. The first tickets were sold on October 3, 1985.\n\nThe California State Lottery Act of 1984 was intended to provide more money to schools without imposing extra taxes. Accordingly, the Lottery was required to provide at least 34% of its revenues to public education, supplementing (not replacing) other funds provided by California. Another 50% of its revenues must be paid to the public in the form of prizes, making a mandated minimum of 84% of all funds that must be given back to the public in the form of prizes or funds for public education. The remainder, a maximum of 16%, was to be spent on administration, such as salaries and running the games.\n\nOn April 8, 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law Assembly Bill 142 (Hayashi, D-Hayward). Amending the Lottery Act, this bill reallocates Lottery revenues \"so as to maximize the amount of funding allocated to public education.\" As an urgency statute, this bill took effect immediately. The new allocation increased to at least 87% the portion of Lottery revenue returned to the public, and correspondingly decreased to a maximum of 13% the amount spent on administration. It then specified that \"not less than 50% of the total annual Lottery revenues, in an amount to be determined by the commission, be\nreturned to the public in the form of prizes.\" This leaves \"the commission to establish the percentage to be allocated to the\nbenefit of public education at a level that maximizes the total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education.\" It also imposed requirements \"to ensure continued growth in Lottery net revenues allocated to public education\", with annual procedures that would, \"in any one of the first 5 full fiscal years after the enactment of this measure, ... provide for the repeal of the changes made by this measure on the following January 1, and the prior law to be restored\", if those requirements were not then met. This bill follows the practice of \"other large state lottery systems, including Texas, North Carolina, and Florida, which have shown an increase in revenue through similar changes.\"\n\nThe Lottery Act mandates a five-member commission, appointed by the governor, to \"oversee the Lottery and the Director\" and make quarterly reports \"to the Governor, the Attorney General, the Controller, the Treasurer, and the Legislature.\" Annually the commission selects a chairperson. Regular meetings of the commission are held at least quarterly and are open to the public. On January 29, 1985, Gov. George Deukmejian appointed the first Lottery commissioners: William Johnston, Laverta Montgomery, John Price, Howard Varner, and Kennard Webster. Deukmejian appointed the first director, Mark Michalko, formerly Ohio Lottery legal counsel, in May 1985. On , Governor Jerry Brown appointed Gregory J. Ahern to the Commission, who was also elected as Sheriff of Alameda County in 2006.\n\nThe California State Lottery began on November 6, 1984, when a majority (58%) of California voters passed Proposition 37, the California State Lottery Act of 1984, authorizing the creation of a lottery. On January 29, 1985, Gov. George Deukmejian appointed the first Lottery commissioners: William Johnston, Laverta Montgomery, John Price, Howard Varner, and Kennard Webster. The Lottery Act mandated an extremely tight timeline for establishing the Lottery and bringing it to operational status. To comply, the state government immediately built the Lottery's original headquarters in only three months in the Richards neighborhood of Sacramento (just north of downtown), where it has been located ever since. Governor Deukmejian appointed the Lottery's first director, Mark Michalko, formerly Ohio Lottery legal counsel, in May 1985. The first lottery games were Scratchers; sales began on October 3, 1985. A weekly Lotto game began a year later on October 14, 1986.\n\nIn 1996, as a result of a lawsuit by Indian tribes, the Supreme Court of California unanimously struck down the lottery's implementation of keno, ruling that it was a house-banked game, not a lottery game, which at that time was illegal anywhere in California. In her opinion for the court, Associate Justice Kathryn Werdegar explained that the California Penal Code and case law interpreting the Penal Code have traditionally distinguished between a \"lottery\" and a \"banked game\" or \"banking game,\" and it was the intent of the state electorate in enacting the Lottery Act to allow only a \"lottery.\" In a true \"lottery\", the players play against each other; in a \"banked game\", they play each other \"and\" against the house. The critical distinction between the two is that a bank in a \"banked game\" can be broken based purely upon whether each of the individual bets is won or lost; the house unconditionally promises to pay prizes on all winning bets with no maximum ceiling. The high court explained that while this definition of a lottery does not prohibit fixed-prize lotteries, such lotteries are valid only if the total prize amount and the maximum number of fixed prizes to be won are fixed before the draw. Subsequently, California Attorney General Dan Lungren also ruled that Daily 3, which at the time had fixed payouts, also was illegal because it created an interest on the part of the state that fewer people should win, contrary to a lottery where the operator has no stake in the outcome of the draw. In response to these rulings, the Lottery modified Keno and created Hot Spot, which has a pari-mutuel payout format, and modified Daily 3 to a pari-mutuel format where payouts vary depending on the number of individuals who picked the winning numbers.\n\nCalifornia joined Mega Millions on June 22, 2005; it became the 12th jurisdiction to offer the game, and the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion with Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). A Mega Millions drawing was held in Hollywood to commemorate the event.\n\nIn September 2011, the California Lottery moved into a new $58 million headquarters at 700 North 10th Street across the street from the old one, which it promptly demolished. Because it was built in a frantic 90-day rush to comply with the Lottery Act, the original headquarters had numerous construction defects in the roof, foundation, and elevator, as well as a mold problem.\n\nCalifornia, while initially never desiring to offer Mega Millions's rival Powerball, was briefly a member of the MUSL because an \"international\" lottery game that would have included a number of US lotteries was planned; however, the game never came to fruition. However, in February 2012 the California Lottery initiated an impact analysis of the Powerball game, in preparation for a recommendation in July 2012. Subsequently, the Fiscal Year 2012–2013 Business Plan included funding for a launch of Powerball within the fiscal year, with Powerball launching in California on April 8, 2013. As a result of the California Supreme Court's decision, California is the only state with variable payouts for both games.\n\nPlaying Daily 3 involves picking three digits 0 through 9 and a playstyle. Bettors can choose Quick Pick to have the numbers picked randomly by computer. The playstyle choices are straight (this is the default if the player doesn't choose one) box, or straight/box. The game costs $1 per play, per draw, and the Advance Play option allows up to 14 consecutive draws. There are two draws every day, televised at 1:29pm and 6:59pm.\n\nA \"pick 4\" type game premiered on May 19, 2008. Each play costs $1 and drawings are held once per day. Playstyles, like \"Daily 3\".\n\nA Daily Derby is a mock horse racing game. Players choose three horses out of 12, one each to finish first (win), second (place) and third (show); players also choose a race time from 1:40:00 to 1:49:99, by marking the last three digits of the time on the playslip. Alternately, players can select Quick Pick to have the computer choose the horses, the race time, or both. Daily Derby also offers Advance Play for up to 14 consecutive draws. The game costs $2 per play, per draw; held daily at 6:35pm and televised at 6:59pm.\n\nFantasy 5 players choose five numbers from 1 through 39. A ticket includes up to five sets of numbers; they can be played up to 12 drawings. Games cost $1 per play. Fantasy 5 is drawn evenings at 6:35pm and televised at 6:59pm. Jackpots begin at $65,000.\n\nA player who bought a $5 Fantasy 5 ticket used to get a coupon to mail in for a \"second-chance\" drawing to be on the \"Make Me a Millionaire\" show, or to play the Dream Machine on the first TV show, \"The Big Spin\". That drawing was cancelled in July 2010 and now players receive a \"second-chance\" coupon with a twenty digit code. Players can enter those codes at www.calottery.com/fan5 to be entered into a weekly drawing for a cash prize ranging from $1,000 to $10,000.\n\nSuperLotto Plus is a lotto game played in the style of Mega Millions. SuperLotto Plus is drawn every Wednesday and Saturday. The game began in 1986 as \"California SuperLotto\". In 2000, the name was changed to SuperLotto Plus. Its starting jackpot is $7 million (annuitized); a cash option is available for jackpot winners.\n\nWhile the cash option usually is chosen, the SuperLotto Plus annuity is graduated. As of the May 11, 2013 drawing, the advertised annuity jackpot represents a 30-payment graduated annuity stream, similar to that of Mega Millions, partly in response to low long-term interest rates. The cash value is now guaranteed. The graduated payments begin at 1.81% of the jackpot amount and rise exponentially such that the final payout is 5.56% (more than triple that of the first payment) of the advertised jackpot amount. Previously, the first payment was 2.5% of the annuity value (or share) of the jackpot, with the second installment 2.7%. The remaining 24 payments increased by 0.1 percentage point yearly, so that the final (26th) installment represented 5.1% of the annuity.\n\nHot Spot is a quick-draw keno style game. The game was updated on August 1, 2011, to allow players to choose to play any number of \"spots\" from 1 through 10 from a pool of numbers from 01 through 80. A new higher top prize of $100,000 was also offered for 10 spot play. Previously, players could only choose to play 2, 3, 4, 5 or 8 spots. Wagering can be either $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, or $20, for a maximum of 100 consecutive draws. In addition, players can choose a Bulls-Eye wager for each draw, hoping to hit the 1 number out of the 20 numbers drawn that is selected as the bulls-eye number. Drawings occur every day and every four minutes from 6:00 am until 2:00 am. Lottery retailers have monitors that display Hot Spot drawings and recent results from other Lottery games. Fixed prizes are awarded. To meet the pari-mutuel requirements, a continuous \"wagered prize fund\" is created from 63% of gross sales, which ensures that the fixed payouts are met under normal circumstances, and calls for reductions should an unusually large number of individuals win a particular prize. If the wagered prize fund exceeds $2.9 million, prize augmentation and promotions are created to distribute the excess funds.\n\nIn 2004, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, as part of his redesign of California government, suggested that California join a multi-jurisdictional lottery. In June 2005, the Lottery Commission voted to join Mega Millions.\n\nCalifornia is unique among the 45 Mega Millions participants in that all nine prize levels for Mega Millions within its borders are always parimutuel, rather than each non-jackpot prize having a set value. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. For example, the \"advertised\" second prize in Mega Millions is $1,000,000; it is not unheard of for that prize level to pay over $1.9 million to a California second-prize winner. The second prize pool within California frequently rolls; it is, in effect, a \"secondary jackpot\". Unlike the other Mega Millions members, California currently does not offer the \"Megaplier\", which is drawn in Texas by a random number generator. It costs $2 per play as of Tuesday October 31st, 2017 because their starting jackpot starts at $40 million dollars when someone hits their jackpot. Starting the April 7th, 2020 draw and this point forward, their jackpot will plunge down to $20 million dollars for the next draw if and only if at least one ticket hits their jackpot at any time!\n\nIn February 2012, as a response to declining sales and low per-capita revenue from the lottery, California Lottery management initiated a review of whether Powerball would be appropriate for the state. In September 2012, the Lottery Commission approved management's request to launch Powerball in April 2013, citing a net increase in revenue of $90 to $120 million as a result of Powerball, desiring to avoid the launch of a $20 scratcher in fall 2013. Since the Lottery Act requires that Lottery staff be present at all draws, two part-time employees audit the Powerball draws, which are held at a studio in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nIn November 2012, California promulgated the regulations for Powerball in the state. Similar to Mega Millions, all non jackpot draws in the state are within an intrastate pool, with California sending its jackpot share (30% of draw sales) to MUSL for addition to the multi-state jackpot pool. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. Each pool for a particular prize category will rollover, thus the \"pick 5\" prize will create a secondary jackpot similar to the \"pick 5\" payout in California's implementation of Mega Millions. Also, as a result of the California Supreme Court ruling which mandates pari-mutuel payouts, California will not participate in the \"PowerPlay\" multiplier option. California launched Powerball on April 8, 2013, with the first drawing on April 10, 2013. The marketing budget was $8.4 million, and included experiential \"red balls\" placed at various locations within the state and television, radio, and online advertising! Their jackpot plunged down to $20 million dollars when a Powerball ticket was won in New Jersey worth $190 million dollars on April 8, 2020!\n\nLittle Lotto: A pick 6-out-of-39 game with a fixed top prize of $500,000.\n\nDecco: Played in a similar fashion as most US \"pick-4\" drawing games, except players had to match one playing card (2 through Ace) in each of the four suits.\n\nTopper: Each SuperLotto Plus ticket automatically was printed with the names of three of California's 100 then-most-populous-cities (e.g. Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento). If the player wagered an additional $1, they were eligible to win up to $25,000 in the \"Topper\" drawing, which was drawn by random number generator.\n\nThe California Lottery offered two raffles; March 17, 2007 and one on January 1, 2008. The raffles offered the best chance to win a $1 million prize, as well as various smaller prizes, and were designed to respond to lottery players' complaints that many million dollar prizes be offered instead of a few larger prizes. However, the raffles did not sell out, and were not repeated.\n\nThe California Lottery has had two TV game shows.\n\n\"The Big Spin\", the California Lottery's first game show, broadcast its final episode on January 10, 2009, ending its run as the longest-running lottery game show in the US. The Lottery had several methods for choosing contestants, including prizes in Scratchers games and \"second-chance\" drawings from other games. The top prize was fixed at $3 million; the minimum guaranteed prize was $1,750. While Big Spin Scratchers remained in circulation in 2009, winners who would previously have spun the wheel on \"The Big Spin\" had the option to spin the wheel—untelevised—as an alternative to going to the \"Make Me a Millionaire\" show, which succeeded \"The Big Spin\". Following the show's ending in 2009, the California Lottery commission deemed the wheel to be too historic to salvage, and decided to preserve \"The Big Spin\" wheel as part of a permanent exhibit at their headquarters in Sacramento. Guests are invited to spin the wheel for fun without cash prizes.\n\n\"Make Me a Millionaire\", the California Lottery's second TV game show, debuted on January 17, 2009, for an initial four-year run with host Mark L. Walberg and co-presenter Liz Hernandez. On May 4, 2010, the California Lottery announced the show's cancellation due to poor ratings, with the last program telecast on July 3, 2010. The show will not be replaced; money that was allocated for its production will be used for prizes for the Lottery's Scratchers games.\n\nPlayers qualified for the \"Make Me a Millionaire\" show by winning in the \"Make Me a Millionaire\" Scratchers game, or by a Fantasy 5 second-chance drawing; when the show began, winners from \"Big Spin\" Scratchers also qualified. After the TV show was canceled, winners of the \"Make Me a Millionaire\" Scratchers games, which were sold until June 25, 2010, had until December 22, 2010, to claim their opportunities to play and win prizes off the air. Similarly, Fantasy 5 second-chance draw coupons, which were discontinued on July 4, 2010, could be submitted by December 31, 2010. Five unaired episodes of \"Make Me A Millionaire\" were produced and made available for viewing on the Lottery's YouTube channel.\n\nDuring the game play, each of the 12 contestants won at least $2,000; seven of the contestants were selected randomly to play four different games of chance with a top prize of at least $1 million. The first game, Lucky Penny, gave three players a minimum prize of $2,000 and the possibility of winning a car. The second game is Safe Cracker, in which two players competed for prizes ranging from $2,000 to $92,000. Next is California Cool, with one player and prizes ranging from $5,000 to $200,000. The last game is Millionaire, also for one player; it guaranteed $10,000 with a jackpot that began at $1 million, increasing by $200,000 each week until won.\n\nCalifornia sells scratch cards under the branding \"Scratchers\". The prizes are smaller than other lottery games, but there are better odds (averaging 1:5). There are dozens of Scratchers games on sale at any time, and the selection of games changes frequently. Winners must be claimed within 180 days of the announced end-of-game date. Scratchers range in price from $1 to $30. A $20 scratcher, \"$5 Million Jackpot\", was introduced September 25, 2013. To commemorate the Lottery's 30th anniversary, on August 24th, 2015, a $30 Scratcher \"California Lottery 30th Anniversary\" was launched.\n\nFor each prize of less than $600, players may collect from either a Lottery retailer or the Lottery itself. Prizes of $600 or more must be collected from the Lottery, via claim form.\n\nAlmost all prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the draw or the announced end of the game. If the 180th day is a weekend or holiday, the final claim date is extended to the next business day. Any unclaimed prize money is transferred to the education fund in addition to the minimum 34% that the Lottery is already obligated to transfer from income.\n\nBecause many of the 44 Mega Millions participants have a one-year claim period, the California legislature changed the language in the Lottery Act. On April 23, 2008, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Assembly Member Van Tran's Assembly Bill 1251, modifying California Government Code section 8880.321 to allow for a one-year claim period for a Mega Millions jackpot prize. This is the only prize in California that has a one-year claim period. All other prizes have the 180-day claim period. This legislation affected Mega Millions drawings after July 5, 2008.\n\nAll prizes for Fantasy 5, Daily Derby, Daily 3, Daily 4, and non-jackpot SuperLotto Plus, Mega Millions, and Powerball prizes, are paid out in one payment, less 24% or 33% (depending upon the winner's tax documentation) Federal withholding if the prize is over $5,000. Merchandise prizes over $5,000 are subject to 33% Federal withholding. Scratchers tickets are generally one-payment prizes; however, some games have annuity options for payments each year, or per week. California does not tax California Lottery winnings, however it taxes lottery winnings from other jurisdictions. For SuperLotto Plus and Mega Millions jackpots, the player may choose a single cash payout for a floating percentage of the jackpot, or an annuity. The SuperLotto Plus, Mega Millions, and Powerball payment schedule are on a graduated basis over 30 annual payments. Until 2005, when California joined Mega Millions, the payment choice on SuperLotto Plus had to be made when the ticket was bought. Since then, there is a 60-day window after winning, in which the choice of cash or annuity is to be made.\n\nUnclaimed prizes remaining after the claim period expires always go to supporting California’s public schools. As of the end of FY 2013–14, a total of $793.5 million in unclaimed prizes have been awarded to education.\n\n\n"}

He is a former Formula 3000 champion and three-time runner-up in the Champ Car World Series.\n\nJunqueira started racing karts in Brazil and dominated Formula Three Sudamericana before moving to Formula 3000. He tested for the Williams Formula One team for many years, and came close to landing a race drive in 2000, losing out to Jenson Button. He rebounded from this setback, winning that year's International Formula 3000 Championship.\n\nIn 2001 Junqueira joined the CART Championship Car series driving for Chip Ganassi Racing where he had immediate success, capturing a win in his 14th race and finished second in points with two wins the following year. In 2003 Ganassi left to the rival Indy Racing League and Junqueira joined Newman/Haas Racing, the top team remaining in what was now the Champ Car World Series. He captured series runner up honors in both 2003 and 2004, capturing two wins in each of those seasons. He also drove in the Indianapolis 500 four times for both Ganassi and Newman/Haas in one-off appearances. In 2002, he qualified for the pole position, and he twice finished 5th in the race.\n\nIn the 2005 Indianapolis 500 Junqueira crashed head-on into the turn one wall after colliding with backmarker A.J. Foyt IV. He suffered a concussion and a fractured vertebrae and missed the remainder of the 2005 Champ Car season. Junqueira was the Champ Car points leader at the time, having won the second race of the year in Monterrey, Mexico. Veteran Oriol Servia took his place and finished runner-up in the standings.\n\nIn 2006 he returned to the cockpit at Newman/Haas but for the first time in his career he did not win a race and only finished fifth in the championship while his teammate Sébastien Bourdais won his third straight title. He was replaced in the second Newman/Haas car in 2007 by rookie Graham Rahal and Junqueira signed to drive for Dale Coyne Racing as teammate to the inexperienced Katherine Legge. Junquiera finished seventh in the championship including three consecutive podium finishes late in the season.\n\nPrior to the 2008 Indycar Series Season, Champ Car unified with the rival Indy Racing League. Junqueira drove the #18 car for the Coyne team's first season in the new series, alongside Brazilian rookie countryman Mario Moraes. His Indianapolis 500 was ruined by a mirror falling off, causing him to lose three laps during repairs. His season was not a great success, as he finished 20th overall with only two top ten finishes, both on road courses.\n\nHe was out of a drive for 2009. He made a deal with Conquest Racing for the Indianapolis 500 and qualified the car on Bump Day, but was asked to withdraw for the team's regular driver Alex Tagliani, who had failed to qualify his car due to a technical failure.\n\nIn 2011, driving for A. J. Foyt, he qualified his car for the 500 in nineteenth position, only to once again have to give up his chance to drive in the actual race.

The dam serves at once four distinct purposes: it generates hydroelectricity; it regulates and limits flooding; it releases stored water to permit year-round navigation on the lower Cumberland River; and it creates Lake Cumberland for recreation, which has become a popular tourist attraction. Because of seepage problems in the dam's foundation, it has become the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers's top dam priority. U.S. Route 127 is built on top of the dam.\n\nConstruction of the Wolf Creek Dam was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 and the River Harbor Act of 1946 as part of a comprehensive plan to develop the Cumberland River Basin. Construction began in 1941 but because of World War II and other factors, construction was not completed until 1951. Lake Cumberland is one of four major flood control reservoirs for the Cumberland; the others being J. Percy Priest Dam, Dale Hollow Dam, and Center Hill Dam. The last of the power generators was installed in 1952.\n\nWhile several small towns were adversely affected by the construction of the dam, such as nearby Creelsboro (downstream) and Burnside (upstream), the dam is credited with preventing several hundred million dollars in flood damage.\n\nThe Wolf Creek Dam is a long and high dam with a combined earthen and concrete structure. The concrete section of the Wolf Creek Dam consists of 37 gravity monoliths that comprise of the dam's length, across the old river channel. The spillway section contains ten tainter gates and six low level sluice gates. The power intake section contains the penstocks that feed the six 45 MW turbines. The embankment section extends from the end of the concrete gravity portion across the valley to the right abutment. It has a maximum height of above the top of rock. The non-zoned embankment is composed of well-compacted, low plasticity clays, from the valley alluvium.\n\nIn 1968, signs of seepage problems within Wolf Creek Dam's earthen embankments and foundation were discovered. Sinkholes appeared at the downstream toe of the dam, and muddy water was observed in the dam's outflow channel. The seepage problems were traced to the karst geology of the region which allows for the dissolution of limestone in the dam's foundation. Solution channels caused by this process allow piping to occur, which adds to the rate of erosion in the foundation.\n\nThe dam and its adjacent reservoir reside upon a heavy Karst bedrock foundation. Karst formations are large void spaces lying beneath seemingly solid species of limestone bedrock. Karst formations are created when limestone bedrocks are, over time, attacked by water through natural precipitation seepage. The rain or snowmelt water contains dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which, in solution, forms a weak carbonic acid. That acid attacks the limestone rock dissolving it and thereby leading to the voids within the rock formation. When a reservoir of 100+ feet in elevation is raised above this style of foundation, the hydraulic pressure of the water easily dislodges the cementing clays that are in the cracks and void spaces of the underlying Karst foundation.\n\nKeying a concrete dam's footing form into such a foundation; along with injecting waterproof grout into the void spaces between the dam's concrete base and the rock foundation (so as to fill the foundation's voids) will usually create a watertight seal above, at, and below the foundation of a concrete dam, in a Karst locale.\n\nHowever Wolf Creek is primarily an earth fill embankment dam. In this form of construction the majority of the dam's structure (measured by length across the streambed) is a nominally waterproof earth fill embankment body, with only the powerhouse and (if so equipped) the controlled overflow spillway section located within a concrete monolith. In the particular case of Wolf Creek dam, the earth embankment section is placed directly upon the formerly existing streambed; with only the surface soils and clays removed. While the upstream interface between the embankment section's foot and the old streambed is nominally waterproof, the Karst solution channels far under the mass of the earth embankment section proper, can directly attack the porous and not waterproofed foundation of the earth embankment section of the dam. It is this phenomenon that has occurred and led directly to the seepage problem.\n\nA short-term solution of grouting the existing seepage channels was employed immediately; grouting in the dam foundation ran from 1968 to 1970 and is credited with saving the dam. Construction of a long-term solution began in 1975 in the form of a seepage cut-off wall. A concrete diaphragm wall was chosen as the appropriate cut-off solution and extended through the earth embankment into the rock foundation. The cut-off wall was completed in 1979.\n\nDespite efforts to stem the seepage, continuous monitoring of the dam shows that seepage problems have not been completely alleviated and are increasing. Reports of seepage has caused public worry and if Wolf Creek Dam fails, the USACE estimates US $3 billion in property damage. Seepage has likely found new paths around, and possibly through, the cut-off wall previously placed. Since March 2005, around the time when increased seepage rates were discovered, Lake Cumberland has been held at nearly constant water levels to reduce the stresses placed on the structure and its foundation.\n\nIn late January 2007, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers placed the dam under a 'high risk' for failure designation, along with Center Hill Dam in Tennessee, both of which are two major dams upstream from Nashville, Tennessee. A new long-term solution was proposed to solve, or control, the current seepage problem. A grout curtain and a new concrete diaphragm wall of greater dimensions will be constructed with newer technologies. To reduce the stresses on Wolf Creek Dam, and thus the risk, the Corps planned to lower Lake Cumberland to , lower than normal summer levels. However, this will affect up to 200,000 area citizens' water supply and has also met resistance from marina owners, so the water level has remained at below normal. This 40 ft. lowered lake level is to be held for an indefinite amount of time and will be subject to frequent review. In October 2007, warning sirens were installed in counties downstream from the dam. Phase one remedial work began in March 2006. Phase two, which includes grouting the dam's foundation, began in January 2007.\n\nIn April 2009, construction began on a new concrete barrier wall within the embankment of the Wolf Creek Dam. The concrete wall was planned for completion in 2012 at a cost of US $584 million. A risk-benefit analysis suggests a 7:1 benefit. In 2010, the Commonwealth of Kentucky proposed a new route for US 127 that would cross the Cumberland River in the first bend downstream, potentially removing traffic from atop the dam. Timing of the project is uncertain. The barrier wall begun in 2009 was completed in 2013 and lake levels returned to normal in 2014.\n\n"}

It is made from a mix of sour tasting apples, such as \"Bohnapfel\" or \"Speierling\", respectively. It has an alcohol content of 4.8–7.0% and a tart, sour taste.\n\n\"Apfelwein\" is also regionally known as \"Ebbelwoi\", \"Äppler\", \"Stöffsche\", \"Apfelmost\" (apple must), \"Viez\" (from Latin \"vice\", the second or substitute wine), and \"saurer Most\" (sour must, \"Süßmost\" or sweet must is essentially apple juice). Instead of the name \"Äppler\", restaurants and smaller manufacturers may instead call the beverage \"Schoppen\" or \"Schoppe\", which actually refers to the measure of the glass. \n\nIn the Frankfurt area, berries from the service tree (\"Sorbus domestica\") may be added in small quantities to increase astringency, in which case the specific type of \"Apfelwein\" is called \"Speierling\". In modern times, the term \"Speierling\" is often also used to refer to any more sour variety of Apfelwein, even if it lacks any juice of the service tree.\n\n\"Apfelwein\" is made from pressed apples. The juice or must is fermented with yeast to produce an alcoholic beverage usually around 6% abv. It can be made with the addition of the unprocessed juice from the fruit of a small, indigenous tree known as \"Speierling\" (\"Sorbus domestica\") or \"Speyerling\", an endangered species that is easily confused with the wild apple.\n\n\"Apfelwein\" is mainly produced and consumed in Hesse (where it is the state beverage), particularly in the Frankfurt, Wetterau, and Odenwald areas. It is also found in Moselfranken, Merzig (Saarland), and the Trier area, as well as the lower Saar area and the region bordering on Luxembourg. Several large producers are located in these regions, as well as numerous small, private producers which use traditional recipes. Some of the most famous restaurants where \"Apfelwein \"is served are in Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main). Some of these regions have regular cider competitions and fairs, in which the small, private producers participate. Cider songs are composed and sung at these events. The Merzig region crowns a \"\"Viez\" Queen\", and the lower Saar area a \"\"Viez\" King\".\n\n\"Apfelwein\" is served in a \"\", a glass with a lozenge cut that refracts light and improves grip—a holdover from the past, when some meals were traditionally eaten without cutlery. Traditional \"Apfelwein\" restaurants serve a \"proper\" 0.30-litre (10-oz) serving, although some establishments may also have a 0.25-l or 0.50-l version of the glass. A \"Geripptes\" filled with \"Apfelwein\" is also called a \"Schoppen\".\n\nMost establishments also serve \"Apfelwein\" by the \"Bembel\" (a specific \"Apfelwein\" jug), much like how beer can be purchased by the pitcher in many countries. The paunchy \"Bembel\" (made from salt-glazed stoneware) usually has a basic grey colour with blue-painted detailing. In the Eifel region, near Hunsrück, around Moseltal, along the lower Saar and in Trier, the drinking container is called \"Viezporz\" and consists of white porcelain or stoneware.\n\nHot \"Apfelwein\" is commonly taken as an old household remedy against colds, or as a warming beverage in the cold season. The \"Apfelwein\" is heated and served with a cinnamon stick, possibly with cloves and a slice of orange, much like mulled wine.\n\nAn official \"Viez\" route, (\"Route du Cidre\") connects Saarburg with the border to Luxembourg. An annual \"Viez Fest\" is celebrated in Merzig. The date is usually the second Saturday in October.\n\n\n"}

Their blend of Cantopop, synthpop, new wave and electronic dance music with lyrics which reflected contemporary social, political, and literary themes, made them one of the first alternative and most influential bands of the 1980s Hong Kong music scene. The band enjoyed critical and commercial success until a hiatus in 1990. After their breakup, Wong proceeded as a solo artist while Lau went into acting although the duo have reunited several times over the years.\n\nOn 3 January 2019, the duo received the Golden Needle Award for their outstanding musical contributions at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards.\n\nTats Lau and Anthony Wong Yiu-ming met in 1985 when Wong was working as a DJ for Commercial Radio Hong Kong. Wong answered a singer-wanted advert placed in a music magazine by instrumentalist Lau, who had created two previous bands known as DLLM and Oriental Electronic Orchestra. The two discovered that they had a mutual interest in electronic music and they began working on original material. Lau became the main music composer of their songs. Hong Kong radio personality Winnie Yu christened them as \"Tat Ming Pair\" and they were signed to PolyGram Records.\n\nThe band provided an alternative to the mainstream pop/rock bands of the time due to their melodious synth-based music and politically conscious lyrics combined with themes drawn from classic literature. Their music was influenced by British musicians including Pet Shop Boys and David Bowie. Due to the pitch-sensitive tonal nature of Cantonese, pairing Cantonese lyrics with the western-style musical scale can be a difficult process. Thus they began their ongoing collaboration with lyricists such as Calvin Poon Yuen-Leung (潘源良), Yiu-Fai Chow (周耀輝) and Keith Chan Siu-Kei. The majority of their album art was directed by famed designer William Chang.\n\nThey released their first mini-album \"Tat Ming Pair\" (達明一派) in March 1986, followed by their debut full-length LP \"Tat Ming Pair II\" (達明一派II) in September of the same year. The cover of their debut EP contained an image prominently displaying Wong's long hair, a hairstyle which was considered subversive for men at the time in Hong Kong. Selected songs from their first full-length album were included in the 1986 film \"Kiss Me Good-Bye\" (戀愛季節) starring Wong and Loletta Lee.\n\nTheir second full-length album \"The Story of the Stone\" (石頭記) was released in 1987 and contained some of their biggest hit songs such as the title track, \"Angels of the Road (馬路天使)\" and \"Rear Window (後窗)\". An instrumental version of the title track was included as the opening theme for the film \"Golden Swallow\" (金燕子) starring Wong and Cherie Chung. The film's soundtrack also included an alternate recording of their song \"Searching For Love (情探)\".\n\nThey continued to produce innovative records and their January 1988 release \"I Shall Wait For Your Return\" (我等着你回來) was considered Hong Kong's first concept album. The album theme dealt with the ongoing emigration of Hong Kong residents due to an uncertain political status after the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The album won the award for Best Record Design at the 1988 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards in which the band also won the award for Best Performance.\n\nIn June 1988, they released \"Do You Still Love Me?\" (你還愛我嗎). The album contains one of their most famous songs \"A Murder Unannounced in Advance (沒有張揚的命案)\". The album is also noted for containing the song \"Forbidden Colors (禁色)\" which was one of the first songs in the Hong Kong music industry to deal with homosexuality and has since become a LGBT anthem. The title of the song was inspired by Yukio Mishima's novel and the song has been covered by other artists including Denise Ho and Eason Chan and was featured in the 1992 Evans Chan film \"To Liv(e)\".\n\nThey released \"Fallen Angel\" (意難平) in 1989, the original Chinese title being taken from a line in Dream of the Red Chamber. The album was partially influenced by Spanish guitar melodies. The album lyrically contained varying themes such as \"Love in the Time of Cholera (愛在瘟疫蔓延時)\" which was a dedication to victims of AIDS. The album is also lauded for containing the song \"Forget He Or She (忘記他是她)\" the first song on the Hong Kong music scene to examine gender fluidity.\n\nOn May 27, 1989, the band participated in the Concert for Democracy in China which was a benefit concert held at Happy Valley Racecourse in support of the students involved in the Tiananmen Square protests. The event lasted for 12 hours and raised over 1.5 million USD for the students in Beijing.\n\nTheir final release before their initial hiatus was 1990's acclaimed \"Nerves\" (神經), another concept album which contained many songs relating to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and unease towards the upcoming 1997 handover of Hong Kong such as \"The Ten Young Firemen (十個救火的少年)\" and \"Don't Ask The Sky (天問)\". \n\nIn 1991, the duo split amicably over a difference in musical opinion and a desire to pursue other work.\n\nAfter their separation, Lau formed several musical projects including Tats Lau and Dream (劉以達與夢) and wrote songs for other singers. Lau also composed music for film soundtracks and pursued his own acting career. \n\nWong began to collaborate with other songwriters and lyricists, such as Jason Choi (蔡德才) and Lin Xi. During this period, Wong released several successful albums which reached critical and commercial success. His solo career culminated in him winning the award for Best Original Song at the 1995 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards and the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards (新城勁爆頒獎禮) for his song \"Before Sunrise (春光乍洩)\". The video for \"Before Sunrise (春光乍洩)\" was directed by Susie Au and cinematography was done by Christopher Doyle.\n\nThe band reunited in 1996 to celebrate their 10-year anniversary and released a new single \"A Forbidden Fruit Once Per Day (每日一禁果)\" which won the top prize at the Ultimate Song Chart Awards (叱咤樂壇流行榜). They released their album \"Viva! Viva! Viva!\" (萬歲！萬歲！萬萬歲) in October 1996, staging a large-scale concert filmed at Queen Elizabeth Stadium the same month. They also released a live album entitled \"Viva! Viva! Viva!: The Concert\" (萬歲！萬歲！萬萬歲！！演唱會) in 1997. \n\nThe duo once again parted ways to focus on solo work, not reuniting again until 2004 for the release of the single \"Blessed are the Lonely Ones (寂寞的人有福了)\". In July 2005, they released the album \"The Party\" for their 20th anniversary. They once again staged more large-scale concerts filmed at the Hong Kong Coliseum, Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre and the Shanghai Indoor Stadium. The duo also released the live album \"At the Service Of The People\" (為人民服務演唱會). \n\nThey once again reunited in 2012 to release a single \"It's My Party\" to celebrate their 25th anniversary. They also held a four-night residency concert in April 2012 at the Hong Kong Coliseum entitled \"兜兜轉轉演演唱唱會\" which resulted in another live album and DVD. The duo celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2017 with a series of concerts once again at the Hong Kong Coliseum and they also released the maxi single \"1+4=14\". They released the live album \"達明卅一派對\" in November 2017.\n\nOn January 3rd 2019, the duo received the Golden Needle Award due to their success and artistic influence on the Hong Kong music scene. In April 2019, all of the band's music was removed from Apple Music and other music streaming sites in mainland China as a result of censorship by the Chinese government due to the political and democratic nature of their songs. \n\nIn May 2019, they released the song \"Memory Is A Crime (回憶有罪)\" in honor of the 30th anniversary of the victims of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. It was composed by Lau with lyrics by Lin Xi. The song topped the iTunes chart in Hong Kong but was immediately banned in mainland China where discussion involving the protests and the violent military response is forbidden. On June 4th 2019, Wong performed the song live during the annual Tiananmen Square vigil in Victoria Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A resist can be patterned via lithography to form a (sub)micrometer-scale, temporary mask that protects selected areas of the underlying substrate during subsequent processing steps. The material used to prepare said thin layer is typically a viscous solution. Resists are generally proprietary mixtures of a polymer or its precursor and other small molecules (e.g. photoacid generators) that have been specially formulated for a given lithography technology. Resists used during photolithography are called photoresists. \n\nSemiconductor devices (as of 2005) are built by depositing and patterning many thin layers. The patterning steps, or lithography, define the function of the device and the density of its components. \n\nFor example, in the \"interconnect layers\" of a modern microprocessor, a conductive material (copper or aluminum) is inlaid in an electrically insulating matrix (typically fluorinated silicon dioxide or another low-k dielectric). The metal patterns define multiple electrical circuits that are used to connect the microchip's transistors to one another and ultimately to external devices via the chip's pins. \n\nThe most common patterning method used by the semiconductor device industry is photolithography -- patterning using light. In this process, the substrate of interest is coated with photosensitive \"resist\" and irradiated with short-wavelength light projected through a photomask, which is a specially prepared stencil formed of opaque and transparent regions - usually a quartz substrate with a patterned chromium layer. The shadow of opaque regions in the photomask forms a submicrometer-scale pattern of dark and illuminated regions in the resist layer -- the \"areal image\". Chemical and physical changes occur in the exposed areas of the resist layer. For example, chemical bonds may be formed or destroyed, inducing a change in solubility. This \"latent image\" is then \"developed\" for example by rinsing with an appropriate solvent. Selected regions of the resist remain, which after a \"post-exposure bake\" step form a stable polymeric pattern on the substrate. This pattern can be used as a stencil in the next process step. For example, areas of the underlying substrate that are not protected by the resist pattern may be etched or doped. Material may be selectively deposited on the substrate. After processing, the remaining resist may be stripped. Sometimes (esp. during Microelectromechanical systems fabrication), the patterned resist layer may be incorporated in the final product. Many photolithography and processing cycles may be performed to create complex devices. \n\nResists may also be formulated to be sensitive to charged particles, such as the electron beams produced in scanning electron microscopes. This is the basis of electron-beam direct-write lithography. \n\nA resist is not always necessary. Several materials may be deposited or patterned directly using techniques like soft lithography, Dip-Pen Nanolithography, evaporation through a shadow mask or stencil.\n\n\n\n"}

It is often used as a convenient water-soluble source of isotopes of the radioactive element technetium (Tc). In particular it is used to carry the Tc isotope (half-life 6 hours) which is commonly used in nuclear medicine in several nuclear scanning procedures. \n\nA technetate(VII) salt is a compound containing this ion. Pertechnetate compounds are salts of technetic(VII) acid. Pertechnetate is analogous to permanganate but it has little oxidizing power.

This compound is generated directly from molybdate held on alumina within the generator (see this topic for detail). \n\nPertechnetate has a wide variety of uses in diagnostic nuclear medicine. Since technetate(VII) can substitute for iodine in the Na/I symporter (NIS) channel in follicular cells of the thyroid gland, inhibiting uptake of iodine into the follicular cells, Tc-pertechnetate can be used as an alternative to I in imaging of the thyroid, although it specifically measures uptake and not organification. It has also been used historically to evaluate for testicular torsion, although ultrasound is more commonly used in current practice, as it does not deliver a radiation dose to the testes. It is also used in labeling of autologus red blood cells for MUGA scans to evaluate left ventricular cardiac function, localization of gastrointestinal bleeding prior to embolization or surgical management, and in damaged red blood cells to detect ectopic splenic tissue. \n\nIt is actively accumulated and secreted by the mucoid cells of the gastric mucosa, and therefore, technetate(VII) radiolabeled with Tc99m is injected into the body when looking for ectopic gastric tissue as is found in a Meckel's diverticulum with Meckel's scans.\n\nAll technetium salts are mildy radioactive, but some of them have explored use of the element for its chemical properties. In these uses, its radioactivity is incidental, and generally the least radioactive (longest-lived) isotopes of Tc are used. In particular, Tc (half-life 211,000 years) is used in corrosion research, because it is the decay product of the easily obtained commercial Tc isotope, which is its nuclear isomer. In theory, the longest-lived technetium isotope, Tc (half-life 4.2 million years), would be the optimal isotope for this use.\n\nSolutions of technetate(VII) react with the surface of iron to form technetium dioxide, in this way it is able to act as an anodic corrosion inhibitor.\n\n"}

The reference to the testes (as the term \"balls\" is commonly understood to mean) of the brass monkey appears to be a 20th-century variant on the expression, prefigured by a range of references to other body parts, especially the nose and tail.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, small monkeys cast from the alloy brass were very common tourist souvenirs from China and Japan. They usually, but not always, came in a set of three representing the Three Wise Monkeys carved in wood above the Shrine of Tōshō-gū in Nikkō, Tochigi, Japan. These monkeys were often cast with all three in a single piece. In other sets they were made singly. Old brass monkeys of this type are collectors' items. Michael Quinion, advisor to \"The Oxford English Dictionary\" and author of the website \"World Wide Words\", writes, \"it's more than likely the term came from them\".\n\nEarly references to \"brass monkeys\" in the 19th century have no references to balls at all, but instead variously say that it is cold enough to freeze the tail, nose, ears, and whiskers off a brass monkey; or hot enough to \"scald the throat\" or \"singe the hair\" of a brass monkey.\n\n\n\nThe \"brass monkey\" is the nickname of the house flag of the Cunard Line, adopted in 1878, a lion rampant or on a field gules holding a globe. The reference is almost certainly irreverent humour, rather than a source of the expression, of which variants predate it.\n\nA \"brass monkey\" is one of any number of citrus-flavored alcoholic drinks. In 1986, the hip hop band the Beastie Boys released a single called \"Brass Monkey\" from their album \"Licensed to Ill\", although the song's lyrics are focused on the cocktail of the same name.\n\nUS Patent 4634021 (1987) describes:\n\nIt is often stated that the phrase originated from the use of a brass tray, called a \"monkey\", to hold cannonballs on warships in the 16th to 18th centuries. Supposedly, in very cold temperatures the \"monkey\" would contract, causing the balls to fall off. However, nearly all historians and etymologists consider this story to be a myth. This story has been discredited by the U.S. Department of the Navy, etymologist Michael Quinion, and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED).\n\nThey give five main reasons:\n\nThe reference is most likely a humorous reference to emphasize how cold it is.\n\n"}

He came of a family of small farmer proprietors, who had held land during three centuries. He was intended for the priesthood and entered the seminary of Floreffe, but his energies claimed a more active sphere.\n\nHe left the monastery for the University of Louvain. Here he studied law, and also prepared himself for the military examinations. At that juncture the first Carlist War broke out, and Lambermont hastened to the scene of action to support catholicism and absolutism. His services were accepted (April 1838) and he was entrusted with the command of two small cannon. He also acted as \"aide-de-camp\" to Colonel Durando. He greatly distinguished himself, and for his intrepidity on one occasion he was decorated with the Cross of the highest military Order of St. Ferdinand.\n\nReturning to Belgium he entered the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1842. He served in this department sixty-three years. He was closely associated with several of the most important questions in Belgian history during the last half of the 19th century, notably the freeing of the Scheldt. He was one of the very first Belgians to see the importance of developing the trade of their country, and at his own request he was attached to the commercial branch of the foreign office. The tolls imposed by the Dutch on navigation on the Scheldt strangled Belgian trade, for Antwerp was the only port of the country. The Dutch had the right to make this levy under treaties going back to the Treaty of Münster in 1648, and they clung to it still more tenaciously after Belgium separated herself in 1830-1831 from the united kingdom of the Netherlands, the London Conference in 1839 fixing the toll payable to Holland at 1.5 florins (3s.) per ton.\n\nFrom 1856 to 1863 Lambermont devoted most of his energies to the removal of this impediment. In 1856 he drew up a plan of action, and he prosecuted it with untiring perseverance until he saw it embodied in an international convention seven years later. Twenty-one powers and states attended a conference held on the question at Brussels in 1863, and on 15 July the treaty freeing the Scheldt was signed. For this achievement Lambermont was made a baron. Among other important conferences in which Lambermont took a leading part were those of Brussels (1874) on the usages of war, Berlin (1884–1885) on Africa and the Congo region, and Brussels (1890) of Central African affairs and the slave trade. He was joint reporter with Baron de Courcel of the Berlin Conference in 1884-1885, and on several occasions he was chosen as arbitrator by one or other of the great European powers. But his great achievement was the freeing of the Scheldt and in token of its gratitude the city of Antwerp erected a fine monument to his memory.\n\n"}

It is a parish of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, a United member church of the Evangelical Church in Germany. It is notable for being the seat of the 1848 Frankfurt Parliament, the first publicly and freely-elected German legislative body.\n\nThe Free City of Frankfurt, then governing its legally non-separated Lutheran state church, commissioned to construct the oval-shaped central church building in 1789. The new church building was to replace the former \"Church of the Discalced\" (Barfüßerkirche), which had been torn down in 1786 due to dilapidation. Constructions halted during the Napoleonic wars. The new building was completed between 1829 and 1833 by , whereupon the organ loft was disconnected in 1833. Between 1786 and 1833 Lutheran services were held at the Old St Nicholas Church in the Römerberg square to the south, also owned by the free city and then actually used as garrison church for its troops.\n\nIn 1830, the free city issued the \"deeds of dotation\" (\"Dotationsurkunde\") fixing its long-lasting practice of owning and maintaining the church buildings in its old city centre (so-called dotation churches; Dotationskirchen), but leaving their usage to congregations of the Lutheran state church or parishes of the Catholic church, newly emancipated during the Napoleonic era. The \"deed of dotation\" statutorily established the eternal gratuitous usufruct of nine city-owned church buildings by six Lutheran congregations and three Catholic parishes. Other religious groups, such as Jews and Reformed Protestants were not part of that government funding.\nBecause of its typical Protestant centralised design (\"Predigtkirche\"), allowing everybody easily to hear the reverend or speaker, it was desired as the meeting place for the Frankfurt Parliament in the course of the German revolutions of 1848.\n\nFrom 31 March until 3 April 1848, the building was the meeting place for the \"Vorparlament\", which prepared the election for the National Assembly. On 18 May 1848, the National Assembly met for the first time in the church, and was therefore named the \"Paulskirchenparlament\". Until 1849, the National Assembly worked in the church to develop the first constitution for a united Germany. The resistance of Prussia, the Austrian Empire and a number of smaller German states ultimately destroyed the effort.\n\nIn May 1849, there were a number of uprisings to force the implementation of the constitution, but these were destroyed with the help of Prussia. On 30 May 1849, the \"Paulskirchenparlament\" was dissolved. After 1852, St. Paul's was again used for Lutheran services.\n\nIn March 1944, during World War II, the church was destroyed along with much of the Frankfurt wider city centre in the Allied Bombing of Frankfurt. As a tribute to its symbolism of freedom and as the cradle of Germany, it was the first structure in Frankfurt the city rebuilt after the war. However, the city itself wanted to make use of the to-be-reconstructed building, thus St. Paul's Lutheran congregation and the city concluded to exchange the congregation's usufruct to this building for that of old St. Nicholas Church, only damaged by bombing.\n\nSt. Paul's was reopened on the centennial of the Frankfurt Parliament. Due to financial restraints and an altered concept of use, the original inner form was dramatically altered by the architectural team of Rudolf Schwarz. An inserted floor now divides the basement—which currently serves as a display room—from the actual hall in the main floor.\n\nIn 1963, US President John F. Kennedy gave a major speech in the \"Paulskirche\" during his visit to the country.\n\nFor the 150th birthday of the German democratic experience in 1998, St Paul's once again attracted public interest.\n\nToday St. Paul's is no longer used as a church, instead it became a venue used for various displays and events. The most well-known is the annual awarding of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade during the Frankfurt Book Fair.\n"}

Founded in 1930 by Sir Henry Kelliher and W Joseph Coutts, the partners purchased Levers and Co. and the Waitemata Brewery Co. in Otahuhu. Asia Pacific Breweries acquired DB Breweries in 2004, which in turn was bought-out by Heineken International in 2012. The company mainly produces pale lager, whilst its Tui brand is one of the better-known beers in New Zealand, partly due to strong advertising.\n\nThe company was founded in 1930 by Sir Henry Kelliher with the purchase of Levers and Co. and the Waitemata Brewery Co. in Otahuhu, owned by W.J. Coutts, who became a director.\n\nCoutts' son, Morton Coutts, took over as director in 1946, and later developed a new production process called \"continuous fermentation\", which enabled beer to be made continuously, without the need to stop and clean between batches. The system proved popular enough to be sold to other brewing companies.\n\nDB Breweries owns and operates four breweries in New Zealand - Waitemata Brewery (Otahuhu, Auckland), Tui Brewery (Mangatainoka), DB Draught Brewery (Timaru) and Monteith's Brewery (Greymouth). Mainland Brewery was renamed to DB Draught Brewery in 2012 in honour of the brand’s significance in the South Island.\n\nThe Tui Brewery was established in 1889 by Henry Wagstaff and Edward Russell. The main brand is \"Tui\", a 4% abv pale lager, named after a common native New Zealand bird. The New Zealand Consumers' Institute recently criticised Tui for claiming to be an \"East India Pale Ale\" when it is in fact a pale lager that bears little resemblance to the traditionally hoppy, bitter or malty India Pale Ale styles.\nTui is promoted through a humorous advertising campaign which uses stereotypes, heavy irony and the phrase \"Yeah Right\". These advertisements have caused some controversy, such as a billboard in Wellington stating 'Camilla for Queen? Yeah Right' and one stating 'Aucklanders are people too. Yeah Right'. Others to have made the news include \"Dad's new husband seems nice - Yeah right\" (after New Zealand legalised same-sex marriage); \"I nvr txt whl drvn - yeah right\"; \"When Winston says no, he means no - Yeah right\"; \"Captain, I know a short cut to the port – Yeah right\" (after ran aground near Tauranga); \"Our father in Heaven, Tamaki be your name – Yeah right\"; \"She clearly married Dotcom for his body – Yeah right\".\n\nIn 2010 a church was threatened with legal action after parodying the Tui billboard campaign with the slogan, \"Atheists have nothing to worry about - Yeah Right\".\n\nLiquorLand was formed in New Zealand in 1981 as a wholesale liquor chain, growing to 18 stores in its first year of business. Although it shares the name, it is not related to Liquorland in Australia. LiquorLand is a wholly owned subsidiary of DB Breweries who originated and owns the Master Franchise.\n\nThrough acquisition of rival Dalgety NZ Ltd in 1982, the national chain expanded to 29 outlets. Further expansion throughout the 1980s with the acquisition of the Wilson Neill business in 1989 saw Liquorland reach over sixty stores.\n\nIn April 2000 LiquorLand’s business model changed from being managed stores to a total franchise chain called LiquoLand Limited. Today LiquorLand has almost 80 stores nationwide with sales close to $300 million per year.\n\nIn November 2008, DB Breweries sold the company to Foodstuffs for an undisclosed sum. It is understood that DB was negotiating with both Progressive Enterprises (the holding company for Woolworths' New Zealand operations) and Foodstuffs. It was understood DB made it clear that consideration of future interests for franchisees and staff, as well as the continuation of the brand as a whole, formed a major part of the decision of whom to sell to.\n\nDB officially confirmed that it was looking to continue its relationship with the franchise, retaining marketing and supply agreements.\n\nDB trademarked the word Radler in 2003. This was contested in court by the Society of Beer Advocates who lost the case in 2011 when the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand ruled in favour of DB breweries after a two-year court battle. The Society of Beer Advocates likens this trademark to being able to trademark the word 'Muesli' for cereal and is disappointed in this result as the word radler is commonly used in Europe. This ruling has also been labelled as 'out of touch with reality' and condemned by some intellectual property experts in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the brand products (\"Export 33\", \"Export Dry\", \"Export Gold\" and \"Monteith's Single Source\") have won a Gold Quality Award at the 2011 annual World Quality Selections, organized by Monde Selection.\n\n"}

Streisand herself was critical of the series and her role in \"Mecha-Streisand\", although Leonard Maltin was complimentary about his portrayal.\n\nDuring a field trip to an archeological dig, Cartman discovers a mysterious stone triangle, which he promptly throws away without interest. Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on the triangle as Anasazi. Kyle appears on television to discuss the find, resulting in a jealous Cartman wanting the triangle back. Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns the triangle to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef whether he has seen Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and the triangle on television, tells Chef the boys are in great danger.\n\nStreisand herself finds the boys at the bus stop and demands the \"Triangle of Zinthar\", and gets aggravated when they reject her. As they search for Streisand, Maltin tells Chef she is seeking the boys' triangle to complete a powerful and ancient relic, the \"Diamond of Pantheos\", which will allow her to become an evil and dangerous creature capable of conquering the world. He explains that the diamond was originally split into two pieces and hidden at different points of the world, but Streisand had managed to find the first of the two. Streisand later dons a disguise and visits the boys again, offering them a monetary reward for the triangle. Stan, Kenny and Kyle are suspicious, but Cartman insists they go along for the money.\n\nStreisand takes them to her condo in the mountains, where she ties the boys up and tortures them with her singing voice. Cartman relents and gives up the triangle. Streisand uses the triangle to complete the diamond, transforming herself into a giant mechanical dinosaur version of herself, Mecha-Streisand, and begins to lay waste to South Park with her new form. Maltin and Chef arrive to free the boys, and Maltin asks Chef to call Robert Smith of The Cure for help. Maltin then transforms into a giant robot to battle Mecha-Streisand, but is quickly defeated. The boys evade fiery debris from the fight, but Kenny is killed when he stops to play tetherball and gets strangled by the rope. Actor Sidney Poitier arrives and turns into a giant fanged turtle to fight Mecha-Streisand, but he too is easily defeated. After getting a call from the boys and Chef, Robert Smith arrives and transforms into a giant moth creature.\n\nDuring the ensuing battle, Smith-Moth manages to punch the Diamond of Pantheos away from Mecha-Streisand before flinging her into outer space, where she explodes and dies. The townspeople, including Jesus, joyfully praise Smith as a hero. As the singer walks off into the sunset, Kyle calls out \"\"Disintegration\" is the best album ever!\". The boys split the diamond again to try to prevent anyone else from getting its power and throw the pieces in the trash can. However, Kyle's little brother Ike finds the pieces of the diamond in the trash, resulting in the episode ending with the boys cowering in the presence of a new foe: Mecha-Ike.\n\n\"Mecha-Streisand\" was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker. \"Mecha-Streisand\" first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 18, 1998. Robert Smith, lead vocalist and guitarist for the English rock band The Cure, makes a guest appearance as himself, marking only the second time a celebrity guest played a major role in an episode, after Natasha Henstridge in \"Tom's Rhinoplasty\". Following the success of \"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\", a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in \"South Park\" episodes, allowing Parker and Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars. Parker, a fan of The Cure, said it was his lifelong dream to meet Smith, and he was one of the few celebrities Parker specifically requested to make an appearance. Smith performed all of his lines via telephone and Parker used the first reading of each line, even though they were executed in a very dead-pan voice.\n\nWhen Parker and Stone made fun of celebrities in previous \"South Park\" episodes, they were chosen at random; however, they chose to mock Barbra Streisand based on a strong distaste for the actress. Part of the reason they disliked her was that after Colorado passed Amendment 2, an amendment to the Colorado state constitution forbidding homosexuals from being recognized as a protected class, Streisand made a public statement speaking out against the state and all its citizens, promising she would never visit Colorado again. Parker said he also finds her singing voice annoying, which inspired the scene with Streisand torturing the boys by singing to them. The duo tried to make Streisand's portrayal as \"sick and disgusting as possible\" in \"Mecha-Streisand\". Mary Kay Bergman, a voice artist who had done most of the female voices on \"South Park\", portrayed Barbra Streisand in the episode.\n\n\"South Park\" animators created the episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation animation program most commonly known as \"Alias\". Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said \"Mecha-Streisand\" was slightly more challenging to animate than other first-season episodes due to the laser beam-type effects featured in the final monster fight, which were specifically designed to resemble a low-budget monster movie with poor graphics. The scenes with an instructional guide taking the kids on a fossil hunt were based on real-life arrowhead-digging excursions Parker and Stone went on in Red Rocks Park during their childhood in Colorado. During a scene with Chef and Leonard Maltin driving in a car, actual video footage of Colorado roads is visible through the back window of the car. The footage was shot by a friend of Parker and Stone and used because the animators did not yet know how to create roads in perspective.\n\n\"Mecha-Streisand\" parodies Kaiju films such as Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and Ultraman. Parker and Stone watched many \"Godzilla\" films during their childhoods, and Parker said he knew from the beginning of \"South Park\" that he would base an episode around the films. Streisand is based on Mechagodzilla, the mechanical doppelgänger of Godzilla. Smith is based on Mothra, the giant moth-like monster from the 1961 film \"Mothra\" and also one of Godzilla's rivals, which Parker described as his favorite of the Kaiju films. The scene in which six-inch-tall twins appear and ask actor Sidney Poitier to fight Mecha-Streisand are based on similar scenes and characters from the \"Mothra\" film. Poitier portrays a monster similar to Gamera, a flying turtle monster, and film critic Leonard Maltin transforms into a giant mechanical superhero resembling that of Japanese television superhero Ultraman. During the fights sequence, Stan shouts for Smith to \"use robot punch\", a line frequently used in Japanese robot television shows. The Diamond of Pantheos, on the other hand, closely resembles the pendant worn by a major character in the anime Galaxy Express 999.\n\nWhen the monsters battle each other at the end of the episode, a Japanese man sings songs about each of the monsters while they approach. This mirrors a common element throughout actual Japanese monster movies, which commonly have theme songs for the monster characters. Parker wrote the songs in Japanese language. The English translation for the lyrics sung when Robert Smith transforms translates are, \"I really like Robert Smith\", and the lyrics sung about Mecha-Streisand translate, \"Barbra, Barbra, she's a bitch, Barbra\". When Streisand becomes Mecha-Streisand, the line was written in Japanese, \"From this moment on, I am Mecha-Streisand!\", but Parker said Bergman misread some of the words so the on-air translation was imperfect. Before Leonard Maltin transforms, he screams in Japanese, \"Listen, listen, here's a tulip\", which Parker said is a phrase Japanese children say before passing gas.\n\nDuring the fight scene, a number of skyscrapers are shown getting destroyed. Parker, who acknowledged the buildings were never featured in any other \"South Park\" episode, said they were modeled after real-life skyscrapers in Denver and included in \"Mecha-Streisand\" only so they could get destroyed during the monster fight, a frequent element of battles in real Japanese monster films. Musical elements from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon \"Super Friends\" are also featured during the battle. Actress Sally Struthers, who was previously lampooned in the \"South Park\" episode \"Starvin' Marvin\", is briefly seen during a scene in \"Mecha-Streisand\", in which she is filming a movie scene with Poitier. Kyle tells Robert Smith, \"\"Disintegration\" is the best album ever\". The line was based on Parker's own enthusiasm for The Cure's 1989 album, \"Disintegration\", and Robert Smith himself would go on to say in an interview that the line was his \"happiest moment\". As Smith walks into the sunset, a version of The Cure's \"Let's Go to Bed\" is played on the Japanese Lute (Biwa). Officer Barbrady makes a reference to singer-songwriter Fiona Apple with the line, \"Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass.\"\n\nIn its original American broadcast on February 18, 1998, \"Mecha-Streisand\" received a 6.9 Nielsen rating, translating to 5.4 million viewers in 3.2 million households. At the time, it was a record high viewership for a \"South Park\" episode, breaking the record that was set earlier that month by \"Damien\", and was ten times the average of Comedy Central's non-\"South Park\" programming.\n\nParker and Stone were very happy with the episode, but received feedback from fans that it was one of the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.\n\nStreisand herself took a negative view of her portrayal, stating in a \"Mirabella\" interview, Parker and Stone created the second season episode \"Spookyfish\" in response, where they took a picture of Streisand's head, placed the image into all four corners of the screen and called it \"Spooky vision\".\n\nLeonard Maltin was complimentary about \"Mecha-Streisand\", and told Parker and Stone his children particularly enjoyed his portrayal in the episode. Regarding his appearance, Robert Smith had claimed that nothing in his career mattered as much to his younger nephews and nieces as the fact that he was featured on \"South Park\".\n\n\"Mecha-Streisand\" was released, along with 11 other episodes, in a three-disc DVD set in November 1998. It was included in the third volume, which also included the episodes \"Starvin' Marvin\", \"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\" and \"Tom's Rhinoplasty\". \"Mecha-Streisand\", along with the other twelve episodes from the first season, was also included in the DVD release \"South Park: The Complete First Season\", which was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but they were not included with the DVDs due to \"standards\" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released in a CD separate from the DVDs. In 2008, Parker and Stone made \"Mecha-Streisand\" and all \"South Park\" episodes available to watch for free on the show's official website, \"South Park Studios\".\n\nThe episode was revisited twelve years later in the season 14 episode \"200\", featuring a redesigned Mecha-Streisand. During a duet with Neil Diamond, Mecha-Streisand lets out a green cloud from her groin that disgusts the people of South Park. The original Japanese theme song for the creature also plays in the episode. The Mecha-Streisand featured in \"200\" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, as the animation quality of the series has improved over the years in general.\n\n"}

A scent hound 22–23 inches high at the withers, weighing anything between 55 and 65 pounds, it is a well constructed dog with a slow graceful gait. It has a large, strong head, a medium-length back and a pointed tail that tends to be long and sickle-shaped. Their ears are set at eye level; they have large prominent eyes and quite thick lips.\n\nA well constructed dog, muscled and not too long, giving the impression of strength and energy.\n\n\nIts back is broad and well supported. Its loins are slightly arched. The hips give a slight inclination to its croup, which is well muscled. Its chest is broad and long, rather let down so that the sternal line arrives at elbow level. Its ribs should be well sprung. Its belly flanks fully its body.\n\nIt is strong and quite long; there should be some longer and coarser, slightly offstanding hairs, (like ears of grain) towards the tip. It is carried in a sickle fashion, never falling forward.\n\nA view of the ensemble indicates that its limbs are strong and vertical. Its shoulders are oblique and muscled. Its elbows are set well in the axis of the body. Its forearm should be lightly oblique.\n\nA view of the ensemble indicates that, (seen from behind), the point of the buttock, the middle of the leg, the hock, the metatarsal and the foot are on the same vertical line. Its upper thighs are let down and well muscled. Its hock joints are strong and moderately angulated, and the metatarsals are short and strong.\n\nThey are slightly elongated, strong but sufficiently tight; the pads are black, tough and compact.\n\nIts skin is quite thick. Its hair is short, thick and quite flat. The coat pattern is a dark fawn tri-colour, (similar to the coat of a hare or a badger), with a mantle or in large patches. The head is usually fawn, sometimes with a black overlay. Its main colours being tan and black and white in any combination.\n\nThe Artois Hound is an energetic dog that is brave and loyal. Though it has a large amount of endurance, it is calm and well balanced. It is a moderate sized dog that will feature the best characteristics of the scenthounds. It has a powerful sense of smell, and it is fast and independent. These dogs were bred to hunt rabbits, and they are proficient at this task. These dogs need to be trained by owners who are consistent. They are affectionate and loving to those that care for them. Like all scent hounds they are happiest when on the trail of a good scent.\n\nThe Artois Hound, (a Briquet, (of a small type)), is nowadays used especially in hunting with guns, and on horseback. It drives the game closer taking advantage of their faults with ingenuity; its speed is average but maintained.\n\n\nThere are no known health problems that are specific to the Artois Hound. Any health problems it may develop can be found in most other dog breeds. These dogs may have a maximum life expectancy of 13 years.\n\nThis is a hunting dog that needs extensive amounts of exercise. Without it, the dog could become problematic for its owners. It should be taken on walks daily, and this dog is great for healthy people who love to jog and hike. While it can live in an apartment, it may perform better in a small yard. It is important for owners to make sure this dog is never unleashed in an unsecured area, as it may run off in the direction of the first interesting scent it picks up. It is important for owners to make sure these dogs are given lots of space to move around in.\n\nThe Artois Hound does not require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth short-haired coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although they should be bathed with mild soap only if or when necessary; they should also be dry shampooed occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect. The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).\n\nThis breed, formerly named Picard, was much appreciated in hunting at the time of Henry IV of France and Louis XIII of France, and much sought after. Selincourt already made much of it, wondering and amazed to see these dogs pulling a hare which had passed by one hour ago in dry weather. Le Couteulx de Canteleu, in Manuel de Vénerie Française (1890), (Manual of French Hunting - 1890), praises also the Artois hound. He reports that the artesian breed of his time was crossbred and difficult to find pure but, in spite of that, it still remained one of the best breeds for hare hunting. \nNorthern France, bordering the English Channel, consists of the historical regions of Artois Hound. Hounds from this region stem from some of the earliest types.\nThe Artois Hound was a favorite by the 17th century. The Prince Alexandre de Gray wrote to the Prince de Galle, in 1609, of his intention to \"send a pack of little d'Artois dogs to the king ...\" In fact, this small French hound may have contributed to the formation of the Beagle in England.\n\nBy the 19th century it became popular among French hunters to avail themselves of the dogs from the British Isles. With the importation of many British types, the inevitable crossbreeding resulted in the deterioration of the pure Artois Hounds. Crossing also took place with the taller, more elegant, longer, scroll-eared hounds called Normands (now extinct). During the 19th century, only the packs kept at Chantilly and those of the Prince de Conde retained the ancient type.\n\nIn the 1880s, Ernest Levair and his cousin, M. Therouanne, began a 20-year effort to breed the original d'Artois, removing the last of the Normand blood.\n\nTheir efforts resulted in great success. At the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th, M. Levoir in Picardy had attempted the re-establishment of the old Artois type without really succeeding. During that period and until the beginning of the First World War, it was another Picard breeder, Mr. Mallard, who dominated the raising of the breed. But if he produced very pretty dogs, as witnessed by his numerous awards in canine shows, they were not always in the type conformed with the description given by contemporary authors. For all their efforts however the Second World War was very damaging for the breed and after the Second World War, it was believed that the Artois was all but extinct.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century the breed had nearly disappeared, however in the 1970s a few aficionados\n, in particular Mr. Audrechy, (of Buigny les Gamaches in the Somme), decided to reconstitute the breed from a few remaining specimens which they located after along search. Thanks to their efforts the modern day Artois hound closely resembles the original. There are now about 500 dogs registered in their stud books, making a strong comeback since 1975.\n\nNote that the Artois Hound does not yet have breed standards or classifications in any organisation, other than the FCI.\n\n\n\n"}

Snowy Hydro also owns and operates two gas-fired power stations in Victoria and one in New South Wales, three diesel power stations in South Australia, and owns two electricity retailing businesses (Red Energy and Lumo Energy).\n\nThe company is owned by the Australian Federal government and whilst not a statutory corporation, is established by the \"Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 (Cth)\". Prior to its incorporation under the \"Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)\", the company was previously known as Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority.\n\nThe company manages the Snowy Mountains Scheme which generates on average around 4,500 gigawatt hours of clean, renewable energy each year, which is around 37% of all renewable energy in the mainland National Electricity Market in 2010.\n\nThe company also owns a 300 MW gas-fired peaking power station in Victoria's Latrobe Valley, a 320 MW gas-fired peaking power station at Laverton North near Melbourne, and a 667 MW gas-fired peaking power station at Colongra on the Central Coast of New South Wales. It also owns three diesel-powered peaking power stations in South Australia providing 136 MW between them. The company's production assets are summarised in the table below. These assets are used to generate electricity for sale under contract to the National Electricity Market.\n\nAs part of the company's responsibilities for managing the Snowy Mountain Scheme, Snowy Hydro Limited also collects, stores, and diverts water for irrigation from the Snowy Mountains catchment west to the Murray and Murrumbidgee River systems under what is called the \"Snowy Water Licence\". Granted as part of the for fixed five year terms, this licence prescribes the rights and obligations on the company with respect to the collection, diversion, storage, use, and release of water within the Snowy area. The Snowy Water Licence also imposes some obligations on the company in terms of releasing environmental flows east into the Snowy River and other rivers in the Snowy Mountains region.\n\nIn December 2005, the NSW Government announced it would sell its 58% share in Snowy Hydro, expecting to yield A$1 billion. The Federal and Victorian governments had followed suit, announcing by mid-February 2006 the intent to sell their 13% and 29% respectively, with A$1.7 billion (ranging up to A$3 billion) expectations through a public float. Pre-registration for shares in Snowy Hydro opened in mid May and it was expected that the float would take place some time in July. Over 200,000 people pre-registered to purchase shares in the company over two weeks.\n\nOn 2 June 2006, the Federal Government announced that it would no longer sell its 13% stake in the project, effectively forcing the hands of the New South Wales and Victorian governments to follow suit. The aborted sale followed strong opposition from the public, including government MPs and prominent Australians.\n\nIn February 2014 the National Commission of Audit recommended in its Phase One Report that the Commonwealth sell its interest in Snowy Hydro.\n\nSince privatisation was cancelled in 2006, the company has continued to grow with investment into Snowy Scheme modernisation projects, cloud seeding, development of mini hydro opportunities such as the 14 MW Jounama mini-hydro (commissioned in 2010) and growth of its retailing business, Red Energy. In September 2014 Snowy Hydro purchased gas and electricity retailer Lumo Energy for $600 million. Red Energy currently has 1.6 million electricity and gas customers and is a sponsor of the Newcastle Knights and Breast Cancer Australia, and a partner of Qantas Frequent Flyers.\n\nIn addition Snowy Hydro has developed its gas-fired power station portfolio to reduce risks to the business due to its reliance on water as an energy source, and the potential impact of transmission constraints on the ability of the remote Snowy Mountains hydro generation assets to access the electricity grid. In January 2015 Snowy Hydro acquired the gas-fired Colongra power station in New South Wales.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2277678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277678", "title": "Forced marriage", "text": "Forced marriage\n\nForced marriage is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without their consent or against their will. A marriage can also become a forced marriage even if both parties enter with full consent if one or both are later forced to stay in the marriage against their will. A forced marriage differs from an arranged marriage, in which both parties presumably consent to the assistance of their parents or a third party such as a matchmaker in finding and choosing a spouse. There is often a continuum of coercion used to compel a marriage, ranging from outright physical violence to subtle psychological pressure. Though now widely condemned by international opinion, forced marriages still take place in various cultures across the world, particularly in parts of South Asia and Africa. Some scholars object to use of the term \"forced marriage\" because it invokes the consensual legitimating language of marriage (such as husband/wife) for an experience that is precisely the opposite. A variety of alternative terms have been proposed, including \"forced conjugal association\" and \"conjugal slavery\".\n\nThe United Nations views forced marriage as a form of human rights abuse, since it violates the principle of the freedom and autonomy of individuals. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that a person's right to choose a spouse and enter freely into marriage is central to his/her life and dignity, and his/her equality as a human being. The Roman Catholic Church deems forced marriage grounds for granting an annulment—for a marriage to be valid both parties must give their consent freely. The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery also prohibits marriage without right to refuse of herself out of her parents', family's and other persons' will and requires the minimum age for marriage to prevent this.\n\nIn 2009, the Special Court for Sierra Leone's (SCSL) Appeals Chamber found the abduction and confinement of women for \"forced marriage\" in war to be a new crime against humanity (AFRC decision). The SCSL Trial Chamber in the Charles Taylor decision found that the term 'forced marriage' should be avoided and rather described the practice in war as 'conjugal slavery' (2012).\n\nIn 2013, the first United Nations Human Rights Council resolution against child, early, and forced marriages was adopted; the resolution recognizes child, early, and forced marriage as involving violations of human rights which \"prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of violence and that has adverse consequences on the enjoyment of human rights, such as the right to education, [and] the right to the highest attainable standard of health including sexual and reproductive health\", and also states that \"the elimination of child, early and forced marriage should be considered in the discussion of the post-2015 development agenda.\"\n\nArranged marriages were very common throughout the world until the 18th century. Typically, marriages were arranged by parents, grandparents or other relatives. The actual practices varied by culture, but usually involved the legal transfer of dependency of the woman from her father to the groom. The movement towards emancipation of women in the 19th and 20th centuries led to major changes to marriage laws, especially in regard to property and economic status. By the mid-20th century, many Western countries had enacted legislation establishing legal equality between spouses in family law. The period of 1975–1979 saw a major overhaul of family laws in countries such as Italy,\nSpain, Austria, West Germany, and Portugal. In 1978, the Council of Europe passed the \"Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law\". Among the last European countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were Switzerland, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands, and France in the 1980s.\n\nAn arranged marriage is not the same as a forced marriage: in the former, the spouse has the possibility to reject the offer; in the latter, they do not. The line between arranged and forced marriage is however often difficult to draw, due to the implied familial and social pressure to accept the marriage and obey one's parents in all respects. The rejection of an offer to marry was sometimes seen as a humiliation of the prospective groom and his family.\n\nIn Europe, during the late 18th century and early 19th century, the literary and intellectual movement of romanticism presented new and progressive ideas about love marriage, which started to gain acceptance in society. In the 19th century, marriage practices varied across Europe, but in general, arranged marriages were more common among the upper class. Arranged marriages were the norm in Russia before early 20th century, most of which were endogamous. Child marriages were common historically, but began to be questioned in the 19th and 20th century. Child marriages are often considered to be forced marriages, because children (especially young ones) are not able to make a fully informed choice whether or not to marry, and are often influenced by their families.\n\nIn Western countries, during the past decades, the nature of marriage—especially with regard to the importance of marital procreation and the ease of divorce—has changed dramatically, which has led to less social and familial pressure to get married, providing more freedom of choice in regard to choosing a spouse.\n\nHistorically, forced marriage was also used to require a captive (slave or prisoner of war) to integrate with the host community, and accept their fate. One example is the English blacksmith John R. Jewitt, who spent three years as a captive of the Nootka people on the Pacific Northwest Coast in 1802–1805. He was ordered to marry, because the council of chiefs thought that a wife and family would reconcile him to staying with his captors for life. Jewitt was given a choice between forced marriage for himself and capital punishment for both him and his \"father\" (a fellow captive). \"Reduced to this sad extremity, with death on the one side, and matrimony on the other, I thought proper to choose what appeared to me the least of the two evils\" (p154).\n\nForced marriage was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets. The Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.These marriage ceremonies consisted of no fewer than three couples and could be as large as 160 couples. Generally, the village chief or a senior leader of the community would approach both parties and inform them that they were to be married and the time and place the marriage would occur. Often, the marriage ceremony would be the first time the future spouses would meet. Parents and other family members were not allowed to participate in selecting the spouse or to attend the marriage ceremony. The Khmer Rouge maintained that parental authority was unnecessary because it \"w[as] to be everyone's 'mother and father.'\"\n\nRaptio is a Latin term referring to the \"large scale abduction of women\", (kidnapping) either for marriage or enslavement (particularly sexual slavery). The practice is surmised to have been common since anthropological antiquity.\n\nIn the 21st century, forced marriages have come to attention in European countries, within the context of immigration from cultures in which they are common. The Istanbul Convention prohibits forced marriages (see Article 37).\n\nThe 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery defines \"institutions and practices similar to slavery\" to include:\n\nc) Any institution or practice whereby:\n\nThe Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention, states:\n\nArticle 32 – Civil consequences of forced marriages\n\nParties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that marriages concluded under force may be voidable, annulled or dissolved without undue financial or administrative burden placed on the victim.\n\nArticle 37 – Forced marriage\n\n\nThere are numerous factors which can lead to a culture which accepts and encourages forced marriages. Reasons for performing forced marriages include: strengthening extended family links; controlling unwanted behavior and sexuality; preventing 'unsuitable' relationships; protecting and abiding by perceived cultural or religious norms; keeping the wealth in the extended family; dealing with the consequences of pregnancy out of wedlock; considering the contracting of a marriage as the duty of the parents; obtaining a guarantee against poverty; aiding immigration.\n\nEarly and forced marriages can contribute to girls being placed in a cycle of poverty and powerlessness. Most are likely to experience mistreatment such as violence, abuse and forced sexual relations. This means that women who marry younger in age are more likely to be dominated by their husbands. They also experience poor sexual and reproductive health. Young married girls are more likely to contract HIV and their health could be in jeopardy. Most people who are forced into a marriage lack education and are often illiterate. Young ones tend to drop out of school shortly before they get married.\n\nDepending by jurisdiction, a forced marriage may or may not be void or voidable. Victims may be able to seek redress through annulment or divorce. In England and Wales, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 stipulates that a forced marriage is voidable. In some jurisdictions, people who had coerced the victim into marriage may face criminal charges.\n\nForced marriages are often related to violence, both in regard to violence perpetrated inside the marriage (domestic violence), and in regard to violence inflicted in order to force an unwilling participant to accept the marriage, or to punish a refusal (in extreme cases women and girls who do not accept the marriage are subjected to honor killings).\n\nThe traditional customs of dowry and bride price contribute to the practice of forced marriage. A dowry is the property or money that a wife (or wife's family) brings to her husband upon marriage. A bride price is an amount of money or property or wealth paid by the groom (or his family) to the parents of the bride upon marriage.\n\nMarriage by abduction, also known as bride kidnapping, is a practice in which a man abducts the woman he wishes to marry. Marriage by abduction has been practiced throughout history around the world and continues to occur in some countries today, particularly in Central Asia, the Caucasus and parts of Africa. A girl or a woman is kidnapped by the groom-to-be, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the groom-to-be, for her to lose her virginity, so that the man is able to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage. The future bride then has no choice in most circumstances, but to accept: if the bride goes back to her family, she (and her family) will often be ostracized by the community because the community thinks she has lost her virginity, and she is now 'impure'. A different form of marital kidnapping, groom kidnapping, occurs in some areas where payment of a dowry is generally expected.\n\nA forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other. \"Vani\" is a cultural custom found in parts of Pakistan wherein a young girl is forcibly married as part of the punishment for a crime committed by her male relatives. Vani is a form of forced child marriage, and the result of punishment decided by a council of tribal elders named \"jirga\".\n\nWidow inheritance, also known as bride inheritance, is a cultural and social practice whereby a widow is required to marry a kinsman of her late husband, often his brother. It is prevalent in certain parts of Africa. The practice of wife inheritance has also been blamed for the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\nIn conflict areas, women and girls are sometimes forced to marry men on either side of the conflict. This practice has taken place recently in countries such as Syria, Sierra Leone, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Historically, this was common throughout the world, with women from the communities of the war enemy being considered \"spoils of war\", who could be kidnapped, raped and forced into marriage or sexual slavery. Because women were regarded as property, it seemed reasonable to see them as the chattel of the war enemy, which could now be appropriated and used by the winner.\n\nForced marriage can occur in the situation where in an unmarried couple, one partner forces (through violence or threats) the other partner to enter the marriage.\n\nEnding a forced marriage may be extremely difficult in many parts of the world. For instance, in parts of Africa, one of the main obstacles for leaving the marriage is the bride price. Once the bride price has been paid, the girl is seen as belonging to the husband and his family. If she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.\n\nUK citizens escaping forced marriage abroad are forced to pay their repatriation costs or get into debt. This makes escaping a forced marriage harder.\n\nIn the United States, Unchained At Last is the only nonprofit organization operating to help people in the U.S. escape forced or arranged marriages by providing free legal and social services.\n\nAbu Hurairah reported Muhammad as saying \"A woman who has been previously married should not be married until her permission is asked nor should a virgin be married without her permission.\" They (the people) asked \"What is her permission, Apostle of Allaah(ﷺ)?\" He replied \"it is by her keeping silence\" [Sunan Abi Dawud 2092].\n\nIt appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary for her marriage to be considered valid. The above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract.\n\nThe contract of an Islamic marriage is concluded (but not excluding the bride) between the guardian (wali) of the bride and bridegroom, not between bridegroom and bride but her permission is still necessary. The guardian (wali) of the bride can only be a free Muslim.\n\nA shotgun wedding is a form of forced marriage occasioned by an unplanned pregnancy. Some religions and cultures consider it a moral imperative to marry in such a situation, based on reasoning that premarital sex or out-of-wedlock births are sinful, not sanctioned by law, or otherwise stigmatized. Giving birth outside marriage can, in some cultures, trigger extreme reactions from the family or community, including honor killings.\n\nThe term \"shotgun wedding\" is an American colloquialism, though it is also used in other parts of the world. It is based on a hyperbolic scenario in which the pregnant (or sometimes only \"deflowered\") female's father resorts to coercion (such as threatening with a shotgun) to ensure that the male partner who caused the pregnancy goes through with it, sometimes even following the man to the altar to prevent his escape. The use of violent coercion to marry was never legal in the United States, although many anecdotal stories and folk songs record instances of such intimidation in the 18th and 19th centuries. Purposes of the wedding include recourse from the male for the act of impregnation and to ensure that the child is raised by both parents as well as to ensure that the woman has material means of support. In some cases, a major objective was the restoring of social honor to the mother.\n\nShotgun weddings have become less common as the stigma associated with out-of-wedlock births has gradually faded and the number of such births has increased; the increasing availability of birth control and abortion, as well as material support to unwed mothers, such as Elterngeld, child benefits, parental leave, and free kindergartens have reduced the perceived need for such measures.\n\nForced marriage is prevalent in Madagascar. Girls are married off by their families, and often led to believe that if they refuse the marriage they will be \"cursed\". In some cases, the husband is much older than his bride, and when she becomes a widow, she is discriminated and excluded by society.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, Malawi has \"widespread child and forced marriage\" and half of the girls marry before 18. The practice of bride price, known also as lobolo, is common in Malawi, and plays a major role in forced marriage. Wife inheritance is also practiced in Malawi. After marriage, wives have very limited rights and freedoms; and general preparation of young girls for marriage consists in describing their role as that of being subordinated to the husband.\n\nForced marriage in Mauritania takes three principal forms: forced marriage to a cousin (known as \"maslaha\"); forced marriage to a rich man for the purpose of financial gain; and forced polygamous marriage to an influential man.\n\nIn 2018 a law went into effect known as the Hakkaoui law because Bassima Hakkaoui drafted it; among other things it includes a ban on forced marriage. But it was criticized for requiring victims to file for criminal prosecution to get protection.\n\nForced marriage is common in Niger. Niger has the highest prevalence of child marriage in the world; and also the highest total fertility rate. Girls who attempt to leave forced marriages are most often rejected by their families and are often forced to enter prostitution in order to survive. Due to the food crisis, girls are being sold into marriage.\nBalkissa Chaibou is known as one of the most famous activists against forced marriage in Niger. Chaibou was 12 when she was informed by her own mother that she was to be married to her cousin, and when she was 16, she took to the courts. With little success, Chaibou was forced to a women's shelter before she was finally able to go home where she learned of her parents changed views on forced marriage, that they were now against it.\n\nIn South Africa, ukuthwala is the practice of abducting young girls and forcing them into marriage, often with the consent of their parents. The practice occurs mainly in rural parts of South Africa, in particular the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The girls who are involved in this practice are frequently under-aged, including some as young as eight. The practice received negative publicity, with media reporting in 2009 that more than 20 Eastern Cape girls are forced to drop out of school every month because of ukuthwala.\n\nIn Tanzania, the practices of forced marriage and child marriage impacts the human rights and childhood of girls. Families sell their girls to older men for financial benefits, causing pain among young girls. Oftentimes, girls are married off as soon as they hit puberty, which can be as young as seven years old. To the older men, these young brides act as symbols of masculinity and accomplishment. Child brides endure forced sex, causing health risks and growth impediments. Primary education is usually not completed for young girls in forced marriages. Married and pregnant students are often discriminated against, and expelled and excluded from school. The Law of Marriage Act currently does not address issues with guardianship and child marriage. The issue of child marriage establishes a minimum age of 18 for the boys of Tanzania. A minimum age needs to be enforced for girls to stop these practices and provide them with equal rights and a less harmful life.\n\nIn 2016, during a feast ending the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the Gambian President Yahya Jammeh announced that child and forced marriages were banned.\n\n\"Compensation marriage\", known variously as vani, swara and sang chatti, is the traditional practice of forced marriage of women and young girls to resolve tribal feuds in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The practice is illegal in Pakistan, though it continues to be widely practiced in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. In Afghanistan, the practice is known as baad.\n\nForced marriage is very common in Afghanistan, and sometimes women resort to suicide to escape these marriages. A report by Human Rights Watch found that about 95% of girls and 50% of adult women imprisoned in Afghanistan were in jail on charges of the \"moral crimes\" of \"running away\" from home or zina. Obtaining a divorce without the consent of the husband is nearly impossible in Afghanistan, and women attempting a \"de facto\" separation risk being imprisoned for \"running away\". While it is not socially acceptable for women and girls to leave home without permission, \"running away\" is not defined as a criminal offense in the Afghan Penal Code. However, in 2010 and 2011, the Afghan Supreme Court issued instructions to courts to charge women with \"running away\" as a crime. This makes it nearly impossible for women to escape forced marriages. The Human Rights Watch report stated that\nForced marriage remains common for Kurdish girls in Iran and is also one of the major reasons for self-immolation in Iran. UNICEF's 1998 report found extremely high rates of forced marriage, including at an early age, in Kordestan in Iran, although it noted that the practice appeared to be declining. Kurdish cultural norms which facilitate the practice of forced and child marriage perpetuate the fear of violence amongst Kurdish girls in Iran.\n\nAs in other parts of South Asia, girls in Nepal are often seen as an economic burden to the family, due to dowry. Parents often compel young girls to marry, because older and more educated men can demand a higher dowry. In 2009, the Nepalese government decided to offer a cash incentive (50,000 Nepali rupees – $641) to men for marrying widowed women. Because widows often lose social status in Nepalese society, this policy was meant to 'solve' their problems. However, many widows and human rights groups protested these regulations, denouncing them as humiliating and as encouraging coerced marriages.\n\nDuring the Sri Lankan Civil War, a 2004 report in the journal \"Reproductive Health Matters\" found that forced marriage in Sri Lanka was taking place in the context of the armed conflict, where parents forced teenage girls into marriage in order to ensure that they do not lose their chastity (considered an increased risk due to the conflict) before marriage, which would compromise their chances of finding a husband.\n\nIn 2011 the family ministry of Germany found that 3000 people were in forced marriages, nearly all from migrant families and most (83.4%) from Muslim families by querying help bureaus. These figures exceeded the estimates of help organisation Terre des Femmes, which up until then had estimated that about 1000 migrant women sought help annually. More than half of the women had experienced physical abuse and 27% were threatened with weapons or received death threats. Of the victims, 30% were 17 years old or younger. 31.8% were from Germany, 26.4% from Asia, 22.2% from Turkey and 5.6% from Africa. In 2016 the German ministry of the interior found that 1475 children were in forced marriages. Of those 1474, 1100 were girls, 664 were from Syria, 157 were Afghans and 100 were Iraqis.\n\nForced marriages can be made because of family pride, the wishes of the parents, or social obligation. For example, according to Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood, many forced marriages in Britain within the British Pakistani community are aimed at providing British citizenship to a member of the family currently in Pakistan to whom the instigator of the forced marriage feels a sense of duty. In response to the problem of forced marriages among immigrants in the UK, the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 (applicable in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland) was passed, which enables the victims of forced marriage to apply for court orders for their protection. Similar legislation was passed in Scotland: the Forced Marriage etc. (Protection and Jurisdiction) (Scotland) Act 2011 gives courts the power to issue protection orders.\n\nIn 2008, it was estimated that about 3000 forced marriages took place each year.\n\nIn June 2012 the British Government, under Prime Minister David Cameron, declared that forced marriage would become a criminal offence in the United Kingdom. In November 2013 it was reported that a case was brought before the High Court in Birmingham by local authority officials, involving a then 14-year-old girl who was taken to Pakistan, forced to marry a man ten years her senior and two weeks later forced to consummate the marriage with threats, resulting in pregnancy; the court case ended with Mr Justice Holman saying he was powerless to make a \"declaration of non-recognition\" of the forced marriage, since he was prevented by law from granting a declaration that her marriage was \"at its inception, void\". Mr Justice Holman said that the girl, now 17, would have to initiate proceedings herself to have the marriage nullified. British courts can also issue civil orders to prevent forced marriage, and since 2014 refusing to obey such an order is grounds for a prison sentence of up to five years.\n\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 makes forcing someone to marry (including abroad) a criminal offence. The law came into effect in June 2014 in England and Wales and in October 2014 in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 criminalises forced marriage (section 16 – Offence of forced marriage).\n\nIn July 2014, the United Kingdom hosted its first global Girl Summit; the goal of the Summit was to increase efforts to end child marriage, early, and forced marriage and female genital mutilation within a generation.\n\nThe first conviction for forced marriage in the United Kingdom occurred in June 2015, with the convicted being a man from Cardiff, who was subsequently sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nOf the cases recorded by the government's Force Marriage Unit, run jointly between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, the majority involved South Asia communities, with 37% linked to Pakistan, 11% linked to Bangladesh and 7% linked to India. About 30% involved victims below the age of 18.\n\nIn July 2014, forced marriages were criminalised to protect individuals who were forced to marry against their will (Swedish: \"äktenskapstvång\"). The maximum sentence is 4 years. No court has given the maximum sentence as of January 2019.\n\nSchools in Skåne in the southern part of Sweden report that they discover that about 25 youth are forced to marry annually due them being part of a shame society. An investigation by government organisation \"Ungdomsstyrelsen\" reported that 70,000 youth perceived they were unfree in their choice of spouse.\n\nIn July 2016 an Afghani man in Sweden was sentenced to 4 years in prison for forcing his daughter to marry someone in Afghanistan in the first Swedish conviction. He was also convicted for sexually molesting her Swedish boyfriend, assault, threats, robbery, blackmailing and false imprisonment.\n\nIn January 2019 convicted the maternal uncle and aunt of a 16-year-old girl of an Iraqi family were sentenced to 21 months in jail and to pay 12500 euro in damages for forced marriage. In December 2016 her family discovered that the girl was dating a boy and the family decided to marry her off to a cousin without her knowledge. Under the false pretense that her grandmother was mortally ill, the girl, her mother, aunt and uncle travelled to Iraq where all but the girl had return tickets. In Iraq the grandmother proved to be in good health and the girl was to marry her cousin. Despite having no contacts in Iraq and the mobile phone had been taken from her, she managed to return to Sweden eight months later.\n\nAlthough forced marriage in Europe is most often associated with the immigrant population, it is also present among some local populations, especially among the Roma communities in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe UK \"Forced marriage consultation\", published in 2011, found forcing someone to marry to be a distinct criminal offence in Austria, Belgium, Turkey, Denmark, Norway and Germany. In 2014 it became a distinct criminal offence in England and Wales.\n\nThe Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence defines and criminalizes forced marriage, as well as other forms of violence against women. The Convention came into force on 1 August 2014.\n\nIn November 2014 UCL held an event, Forced Marriage: The Real Disgrace, where the award-winning documentary \"Honor Diaries\" was shown, and a panel including Jasvinder Sanghera CBE (Founder of Karma Nirvana), Seema Malhotra MP (Labour Shadow Minister for Women), and Dr Reefat Drabu (former Assistant General Secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain) discussed the concept of \"izzat\" (honour), recent changes in UK law, barriers to tackling forced marriage, and reasons to be hopeful of positive change.\n\nForced marriage may be practised among some immigrant communities in Canada. Until recently, forced marriage has not received very much attention in Canada. That lack of attention has protected the practice from legal intervention. In 2015, Parliament enacted two new criminal offences to address the issue. Forcing a person to marry against their will is now a criminal offence under the Criminal Code, as is assisting or aiding a child marriage, where one of the participants is under age 16. There has also been the long-standing offence of solemnizing an illegal marriage, which was also modified by the 2015 legislation.\n\nIn addition to these criminal offences, the \"Civil Marriage Act\" stipulates: \"Marriage requires the free and enlightened consent of two persons to be the spouse of each other,\" as well as setting 16 as the minimum age for marriage.\n\nEstimates are that hundreds of Pakistani girls in New York have been flown out of the New York City area to Pakistan to undergo forced marriages; those who resist are threatened and coerced. The AHA Foundation commissioned a study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice to research the incidence of forced marriage in New York City. The results of the study were equivocal. However, AHA Foundation for the past 11 years has operated a helpline that successfully referred numerous individuals seeking help in fleeing or avoiding a forced marriage to qualified service providers and law enforcement. According to the National Center for Victims of Crime Conference, there are \"limited laws/policies directly addressing forced marriage\", although more general non-specific laws may be used. The organization Unchained at Last, an organization in the United States, assists women escaping forced or arranged marriages with free legal services and other resources. It was founded by Fraidy Reiss.\n\nThe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) has been suspected of trafficking underage women across state lines, as well as across the US–Canada and US–Mexico borders, for the purpose of sometimes involuntary plural marriage and sexual abuse. The FLDS is suspected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of having trafficked more than 30 under-age girls from Canada to the United States between the late 1990s and 2006 to be entered into polygamous marriages. RCMP spokesman Dan Moskaluk said of the FLDS's activities: \"In essence, it's human trafficking in connection with illicit sexual activity.\" According to the \"Vancouver Sun,\" it's unclear whether or not Canada's anti-human trafficking statute can be effectively applied against the FLDS's pre-2005 activities, because the statute may not be able to be applied retroactively. An earlier three-year-long investigation by local authorities in British Columbia into allegations of sexual abuse, human trafficking, and forced marriages by the FLDS resulted in no charges, but did result in legislative change.\n\nChild marriage (2008–2014):\n\nSummary:\n\nActivists and women famous for refusing forced marriage\n\n\n"}

In Gascony, according to the families perpetuating the tradition of duck confit, all the pieces of duck are used to produce the meal. Each part can have a specific destination in traditional cooking, the neck being used for example in an invigorating soup, the garbure. Duck confit is considered one of the finest French dishes. \n\nWhile it is made across France, it is seen as a specialty of Gascony. The confit is prepared in a centuries-old process of preservation that consists of salt curing a piece of meat (generally goose, duck, or pork) and then cooking it in its own fat.\n\nTo prepare a confit, the meat is rubbed with salt, garlic, and sometimes herbs such as thyme, then covered and refrigerated for up to 36 hours. Salt-curing the meat acts as a preservative.\n\nPrior to cooking, the spices are rinsed from the meat, which is then patted dry. The meat is placed in a cooking dish deep enough to contain the meat and the rendered fat, and placed in an oven at a low temperature (76 – 135 degrees Celsius/170 – 275 Fahrenheit). The meat is slowly poached at least until cooked, or until meltingly tender, generally four to ten hours.\n\nThe meat and fat are then removed from the oven and left to cool. When cool, the meat can be transferred to a canning jar or other container and completely submerged in the fat. A sealed jar of duck confit may be kept in the refrigerator for up to six months, or several weeks if kept in a reusable plastic container. To maximize preservation if canning, the fat should top the meat by at least one inch. The cooking fat acts as both a seal and preservative and results in a very rich taste. Skipping the salt curing stage greatly reduces the shelf life of the confit.\n\nConfit is also sold in cans, which can be kept for several years. The flavourful fat from the confit may also be used in many other ways, as a frying medium for sautéed vegetables (e.g., green beans and garlic, wild or cultivated mushrooms), savory toasts, scrambled eggs or omelettes, and as an addition to shortcrust pastry for tarts and quiches.\n\nA classic recipe is to fry or grill the legs in a bit of the fat until they are well-browned and crisp, and use more of the fat to roast some potatoes and garlic as an accompaniment.\nThe potatoes roasted in duck fat to accompany the crisped-up confit is called \"pommes de terre à la sarladaise\". Another accompaniment is red cabbage slow-braised with apples and red wine.\n\nDuck confit is also a traditional ingredient in many versions of cassoulet.\n\n\n"}

She holds the record for most nominations without a win with ten for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. In 2019, she received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Eva Ayllón will celebrate her 50th Anniversary in 2020.\n\nAyllón adopted the stage name \"Eva\" from her maternal grandmother, Eva, who initiated her in vocalization at the age of three. As a child and teen, Eva Ayllón sang in school competitions and later on television and radio. Throughout the early 1970s, Eva appeared in many \"música criolla\" musical groups (locally called \"peñas criollas\") such as Rinconcito Monsefuano, La peña de los Ugarte, Los Mundialistas o Callejón and Los Kipus. Ayllón sang as the lead voice in this popular trio from 1973 through 1975, eventually leaving the group to pursue a solo career. By 1979, she began touring internationally, with appearances in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Japan and since then her music and live performances are requested on a yearly basis at international music events. In 1989, Ayllón was invited to join Los Hijos del Sol (Children of the Sun), a supergroup made up of Peruvian musical stars, developed by producer Ricardo Ghibellini in an effort to promote Peruvian music through performance and recording. \n\nAyllón released her first US album, \"Eva! Leyenda Peruana\", on Times Square Records in 2004. Since then, Ayllón's musical presence continues to expand boundaries. In her commitment to broaden the awareness of Afro-Peruvian culture, Ayllón changed her residence from Lima, Peru to New Jersey that same year. \"Leyenda Peruana\" gained praise and recognition in different latitudes, and in Germany it received the Critic's choice award for Best Traditional Recording. The group is about to embark on another US and European tour to introduce new cities and new countries to Ayllon's music.\n\nIn January 2007, Ayllón was honored with a seat among the judges at Latin America's largest music festival, the Chilean \"Festival De Viña del Mar\". In April, Ayllón released a live concert DVD recording titled \"Live from Hollywood\".\n\nAyllón has produced over 30 records, and nominated ten times to the Latin Grammy. Her latest release \"Eva Ayllon Celebra 40 Años Cantandole Al Peru\", is a compilation of her greatest hits, and revisits the musical styles that she has performed over the last four decades.

{"id": "2277686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277686", "title": "2006 Tour de France", "text": "2006 Tour de France\n\nThe 2006 Tour de France was the 93rd edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took between 1 and 23 July. It was won by Óscar Pereiro following the disqualification of apparent winner Floyd Landis. Due to United States Anti-Doping Agency announcing in August 2012 that they had disqualified Lance Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999–2005, this is the first Tour to have an overall winner since 1998.\n\nThe Tour began with a prologue in Strasbourg, on the French-German border, and ended on Sunday 23 July in Paris. The distance of the course (run counterclockwise around France) was . The race was the third fastest in average speed. Along the way, the cyclists passed through six different countries including France, The Netherlands (a stop at Valkenburg in Stage 3), Belgium (at Huy, Stages 3 and 4), Luxembourg (at Esch-sur-Alzette, Stages 2 and 3), Germany (though not stopping there, Stage 1) and Spain (Pla-de-Beret, Stage 11). The presentation of the course was made by the new director of Le Tour, Christian Prudhomme. For the first time since the 1999 edition, there was no team time trial.\n\nThe event, as with some of the Tours of the late 1990s, was marred by doping scandals. Prior to the tour, numerous riders – including the two favourites Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso – were expelled from the Tour due to their link with the Operación Puerto doping case.\n\nAfter the Tour, the apparent winner, Floyd Landis, was found to have failed a drug test after stage 17; Landis contested the result and demanded arbitration. On 20 September 2007, Landis was found guilty and suspended retroactive to 30 January 2007 and stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title making Óscar Pereiro the title holder. Landis appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport which upheld the ban.\n\nIn the most controversial scandal since the 1998 tour, thirteen riders were expelled from the tour on the eve of Strasbourg prologue to the 93rd edition stemming from a Spanish doping scandal. Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso, two favourites to win the race, were among those excluded from the Tour along with podium candidate Francisco Mancebo and Alberto Contador (who would return to win the following year, 2007). Alexander Vinokourov, another race favourite, was not linked to the doping scandal, but was forced to withdraw when the eligible riders on his Astana-Würth Team fell below the minimum starting requirement of six. Because of this and the retirement of then-seven-time consecutive winner Lance Armstrong, this year's Tour started without the top five riders from the 2005 edition. It was also the first Tour since 1999 that did not contain a past champion. All 21 teams were composed of nine cyclists, so 189 riders commenced the 2006 Tour de France.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nAfter the retirement of then seven-time winner Lance Armstrong, the main contenders for the overall win were expected to be Ivan Basso from , the 2005 runner-up; and Jan Ullrich from , the third man on the podium in 2005, winner in 1997, and the only previous winner still racing. However, both Ullrich and Basso were suspended by their teams on 30 June after UCI told T-Mobile and Team CSC that the riders were involved in the anti-doping investigation in Spain. The 2006 Tour also saw the return of former yellow jersey holder and three-time stage winner David Millar () after serving a two-year ban for admissions of the use of the drug EPO, which was discovered in a police search of his house before the 2004 Tour de France, in June 2004.\n\nFrancisco Mancebo of the French team , who finished fourth last year and sixth the year before, was also suspended by his team, and subsequently announced his retirement. Alexander Vinokourov would have been the only returning rider with a top-five finish from last year's race. However, his team, , was forced to pull out of the race because they would not be able to start with the minimum of six riders. As a result of the drug scandal, many believed Spaniard Alejandro Valverde (Caisse d'Épargne), or the Americans Floyd Landis (Phonak), Levi Leipheimer (Gerolsteiner), or Australian Cadel Evans (Davitamon-Lotto) would probably win the race.\n\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 16.\n\nDue to the developing doping case known as Operacion Puerto several top tier riders were denied entry to the 2006 Tour including Jan Ullrich, Joseba Beloki, Alberto Contador, Ivan Basso and indirectly, as his team did not have enough eligible riders, Alexander Vinokourov. The Prologue was won by Thor Hushovd and over the first few flat stages Robbie McEwen claimed three stage victories, but did not take the overall lead at any point as by Stage 3 another sprinter, Tom Boonen, had claimed the Yellow Jersey, which he held until the ITT in Stage 7.\n\nThe ITT was won handily by Serhiy Gonchar who claimed the Maillot Jaune with Floyd Landis finishing in 2nd in the Stage, as well as moving up the standings into 2nd place in the overall. After the ITT Team T-Mobile had four riders in the top 6 overall including Honchar and Andreas Kloden. The top of the GC remained more or less static until Stage 10 when a pair of riders escaped early in the day and stayed away to the finish with Juan Miguel Mercado winning the stage and moving into 2nd place overall and Cyril Dessel finishing the stage 2nd with the same time as Mercado, but taking over the Yellow Jersey as the new race leader.\n\nStage 11 was a brutal mountain stage with five highly categorised climbs. It was won by Dennis Menchov with Levi Leipheimer and Floyd Landis staying with him to the finish line. Landis took over the Yellow Jersey as the new race leader :08 ahead of Dessel. Cadel Evans and Carlos Sastre finished 4th and 5th in the stage and at the same time moved into 4th and 5th in the overall standings. Stage 12 was an intermediate stage won by Yaroslav Popovych who jumped from outside the top 20 to tenth place overall.\n\nThe top GC Contenders wouldn't change places until Stage 13 when Jens Voigt and Oscar Pereiro outlasted Manuel Quinziato and Sylvain Chavanel in a four-man breakaway that finished about 30 minutes ahead of the Peloton. Pereiro jumped everyone to take the overall lead by about 1:30 over Landis and Dessel and around 2:30 ahead of Menchov and Evans with Sastre over 3:00 back.\n\nThe situation remained the same after Stage 14, but in Stage 15 from Col d’Izoard to Alpe d'Huez the race blew apart with Frank Schleck winning the stage and among the GC riders Landis and Kloden winning considerable time on everyone but one another. Landis was back in Yellow by a thread of :10 with the 3rd through 7th place riders of Dessel, Menchov, Sastre, Kloden and Evans each within only three minutes of Landis and Pereiro. Stage 16 was won by Michael Rasmussen as Pereiro took over the race lead with Sastre jumping up to 2nd, Kloden taking over 3rd and Landis coming entirely unhinged and dropping outside the top 10.\n\nIn Stage 17 however, Landis made the potentially catastrophic decision to attack off the front of the Peloton entirely on his own over 100 km from the finish in pursuit of the morning Breakaway bunch. Before long he caught the escapees, rode with the break for a while, then attacked off the front with only Patrik Sinkewitz able to stay with him for any length of time, though without doing any work being as he was teammates with two riders placed higher than Landis in Kloden and Michael Rogers. Landis won the stage with Sastre finishing nearly six minutes back and Pereiro finishing over seven minutes back barely hanging onto the Maillot Jaune by :30 over Floyd Landis and :12 over Carlos Sastre. Amazingly at this point in the Tour Kloden, Evans, Menchov and Dessel were all within 5:00 of the Yellow Jersey. Not since the 1987 Tour de France had even five riders been within 5:00 of the overall lead this late in the race.\n\nStage 18 there were no serious (Cat-1 or HC) climbs and Matteo Tosatto won the Sprint with no change in the overall situation. The Stage 19 ITT would decide the race and Gonchar would win his second stage of the Tour putting in the fastest ride of the day. Floyd Landis won the 2006 TDF by defeating all of the other GC Contenders except for Kloden taking the Yellow Jersey back for the 3rd and final time. Pereiro finished 2nd overall at 0:59 back, Kloden rounded out the podium at plus 1:29, Sastre was 4th over three minutes behind and Cadel Evans finished 5th just over 5:00 slower than Landis.\n\nThis was the first TDF since the first retirement of Lance Armstrong and to the majority of American fans doping by contending riders was thought of as a rare occurrence that just didn't happen even though in reality many GC Contenders, Sprinters and Domestiques of the Armstrong Era, as well as previous eras admitted to doping or were implicated in some form of doping incident. Landis would be stripped of his only Tour de France victory soon after winning it following a confirmed failed drug test after Stage 17 and Oscar Pereiro would be declared the winner.\n\n2006 Tour de France winner Oscar Pereiro was an incredibly talented athlete who finished 10th, 1st, 10th and 10th in the four TDF's that he finished and even scored a goal apiece in the two professional soccer games he played in. He initially failed a drug test in this Tour de France as well, but was cleared after providing sufficient medical evidence that he had a legitimate medical reason for taking the substance he failed for.\n\nDespite Landis having this entire TDF vacated for doping, among some modern riders and fans when a GC rider attacks and finishes a seemingly impossible solo breakaway, as Chris Froome did in Stage 19 of the 2018 Giro, it is referred to as \"Doing a Landis\".\n\nThis was initially the closest three-way finish in the race's history to date. Floyd's final time was 89h 39'30\". While Landis was a leading favourite even before the Spanish doping scandal came to light, in an epic eight-minute loss of performance in , it appeared he had lost all hope to finish on the podium, much less win.\n\nBut the following day, during , Landis set a very high pace on the first climb of the day that no other rider could match. He then caught a breakaway group that had escaped earlier, passed them, and continued to the finish line solo, making up almost all of his deficit, ending up 30 seconds behind yellow jersey wearer Óscar Pereiro, which he made up with an extra minute in the final time trial.\n\nA urine sample taken from Landis immediately after his Stage 17 win has twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone as well as a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. Landis indicated that he would appeal the test results with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nOn 20 September 2007, Landis' doping accusation was upheld by an arbitration panel deciding between him and USADA and will be banned for two years. In response to this, the UCI formally stripped him of his 2006 Tour de France title. Second place finisher Óscar Pereiro was officially declared the winner. The only previous Tour de France winner to be disqualified was 1904 Tour de France winner Maurice Garin.\n\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2006 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There time bonuses given at the end of each mass start stage. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\n\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\n\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1981. The leader wore a white jersey.\n\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were for the first time identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, David de la Fuente () was given the overall super-combativity award.\n\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder and first race director Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 16, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given in honour of the second director Jacques Goddet to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 11. Michael Rasmussen won the Henri Desgrange and de la Fuente won the Jacques Goddet.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2277688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277688", "title": "Geographic areas of Houston", "text": "Geographic areas of Houston\n\nThe geographic areas of Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside Interstate 610, known as the \"Loop.\" Inside the loop generally encompasses the Central business district and the \"island cities\" of West University Place (West U.), Southside Place and a portion of Bellaire. (\"Island cities\" refers to the City of Houston's practice of annexing around the existing boundaries of incorporated municipalities.)\n\nOther \"island cities\" include the Memorial VillagesBunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, Hilshire Village, Hunters Creek Village, Piney Point Village, and Spring Valley Village.\n\nThe outlying areas of Houston, as well as the rest of Bellaire, the Memorial Villages, the airports and the city's suburbs and enclaves are outside the loop. Another ring road, Beltway 8 (also known simply as the \"Beltway\"), encircles the city another 5 miles (8 km) further out. A third, State Highway 99 or Grand Parkway, has begun construction roughly 10 miles (16 km) beyond the Beltway around the outer suburbs and currently extends from north of Interstate 10/U.S. Highway 90 east of Katy to Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 in Sugar Land.\n\nLocations within the Houston city limits inside Beltway 8 had traditionally used the 713 area code. Those outside Beltway 8 but within city limits had received the 281 or 832 area code. The geographic division between 713, 281, and 832 has been eliminated, and newly issued phone numbers (especially for cell phones and fax machines) within that zone may be assigned any of the three codes. There is also a new, 346 area code. Areas far north, west, east and south of the inner-city also use 936 and 409. Zip codes in Houston range from 77002 to 77099. A small portion of northeast Houston uses zip codes 77339 and 77345.\n\nHouston is the most populated city in the United States without zoning laws. City voters rejected creation of separate commercial and residential land-use districts in 1948, 1962 and 1993. As a result, Houston has grown in an unusual manner. Rather than a single “downtown” as the center of the city's employment, five additional business districts have grown throughout the inner-city, including one for Houston's medical center complex. If these business districts were combined, they would form the third largest downtown in the United States. The city also has one of the largest skylines in the United States but because it is spread over a few miles, pictures of the city show, for the most part, the main downtown area.\n\nJohn Nova Lomax of the \"Houston Press\" said that before the interstate system was established in Houston, the neighborhoods were \"strongly distinct neighborhoods and districts with poetic names[...]\".\n\nBeginning in the 1960s the development of the 610 Loop caused the focus of the Houston area to move away from Downtown Houston. Joel Barna of \"Cite 42\" said that this caused Greater Houston to shift from \"a fragmenting but still centrally focused spatial entity into something more like a doughnut,\" and that Downtown Houston began to become a \"hole\" in the \"doughnut.\" As interchange connections with the 610 Loop opened, according to Barna Downtown \"became just another node in a multi-node grid\" and, as of 1998, \"has been that, with already established high densities and land prices.\" By 1998 Beltway 8 neared completion and development increased in the central city. Barna said that \"it's as if Houston had stretched out so far that it its sprawl began doubling back upon itself.\"\n\nLisa Gray of the \"Houston Chronicle\" said that Houston differs from many \"old-style\" European cities and cities of the East Coast of the United States because Houston began with sprawl development and later developed dense cores, as opposed to beginning with dense cores and later developing sprawl. Many denser areas of Houston have parking garages, allowing automobile drivers to access areas with relatively few parking spaces.\n\nDowntown is located in the very center of the city's highway system, bounded by I-45 on the south and west, I-69/US-59 on the east, and Buffalo Bayou on the north.\n\nThe Skyline District is the heart of downtown and home to headquarters of various multinational businesses and financial institutions.\n\nThe Houston Theater District, in north downtown, is home to Houston's eight performing arts organizations and includes the Alley Theatre, Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, Wortham Center, the Revention Music Center, and Jones Hall, home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. The theater district is the second-largest performing arts district, next to New York City.\n\nDowntown is also home to one of the city's two Chinatowns. The first Chinatown is situated in the shadow of the George R. Brown Convention Center downtown, while the newer, larger Chinatown (originating around 1982), is located primarily on Bellaire Boulevard west of the Sharpstown neighborhood.\n\nThe Main Street Corridor in downtown, opened in 2004, has become a popular nightlife spot, particularly now that the city has light rail service. This is because the light rail line begins at the University of Houston–Downtown.\n\nPreston Station is a neighborhood in downtown Houston that takes its name from the Houston MetroRail's Preston Station, which is at the neighborhood's center. It is well known for its bars and restaurants, and includes such famous buildings as the Rice Hotel, the St. Germain building, and the Hotel Icon.\n\nSouth of downtown, but to the east of Meyerland and Fondren, lies Hiram Clarke, Sunnyside, South Park, Kennedy Heights, and other largely African-American communities with sizable Latino populations. Collectively (with the Third Ward) known as the \"Southside\", these formerly rural communities were childhood homes of country singer Kenny Rogers and (more recently) rap artist Scarface.\n\nHiram Clarke is a small neighborhood in south side Houston. The neighborhood is adjacent to Hiram Clarke Blvd. and West Fuqua Street. It was named after a former president of Houston Lighting & Power, a predecessor to Reliant Energy.\n\nThe term \"southwest Houston\" often refers to the area that opened in the years following World War II, when they were considered to be suburbs, such as Alief, Fondren Southwest, Meyerland, Sharpstown and Westbury. Alief is a large, ethnically diverse community which Houston began annexing in 1977. Fondren Southwest and Meyerland are centers of Houston's Jewish community. Sharpstown has large Hispanic and Asian American communities and was the first master-planned community in Houston. Also in the southwest is the Indian enclave, the Mahatma Gandhi District, informally known as Hilcroft. Westbury and Meyerland are becoming popular places for some gay men and lesbians to live, as real estate in the Neartown area has become more expensive as it has gentrified.\n\n\"See Southeast Houston\"\n\nThe Northside of Houston consists of several Historic neighborhoods to include Houston Heights, Near Northside, The Fifth Ward, The Historic Sixth Ward, Kashmere Gardens, Trinity Gardens, Homestead, Acres Homes, Greater inwood ,the East Aldine District and Greenspoint. Residents of these neighborhoods commonly refer to this area as \" Northside \" Many suburban Houstonians confuse the term to be also associated with the suburbs of North Houston such as Klein, Texas, Spring, FM 1960 or The Woodlands. The Northside along with other neighborhoods inside 610 have recently become the focus of Gentrification in an effort to tear down historic homes to make room for modern living to accommodate the influx of young professionals drawn to the Downtown/Inner 610 Loop area. The Houston Light Rail is extending its route that will head north from the University of Houston–Downtown (UHD) along North Main St and Fulton St. The Northside consists primarily of Hispanic and African Americans with the exception of The Houston Heights neighborhood which has a large Caucasian presence. Notable residents of the Northside include Politician Barbara Jordan, Singer Kenny Rogers, Activist Mickey Leland, Rapper Slim Thug and Boxer George Foreman.\n\nThe Energy Corridor is a district that lies along Memorial Drive and Eldridge Parkway in west Houston. The district is loosely bound by the area just north of IH-10 (the Katy Freeway) and Westheimer to the south, and extends from Kirkwood Road to the east and Fry Road to the West. The area is defined by many oil industry related companies, residential neighborhoods, restaurants and parks.\n\nMidtown, located immediately south of downtown, is a recently redeveloped area with many newly constructed apartments and condominiums. The area is also home to Little Saigon, the center of the city's Vietnamese American commerce and businesses. Midtown is roughly bounded by I-45 on the north, SH-288 on the east, I-69/US-59 on the south, and Bagby Street on the west. Midtown is an official State of Texas Cultural Arts and Entertainment District, as of 2012.\n\nUptown is Houston's second-largest business district and home to the world-famous Williams Tower. The Williams Tower is said to be the tallest building outside of a CBD. The District is home to Houston's tallest condominium towers. Uptown has headquarter and subsidiary locations of Fortune 500 companies, high-end retailers, and local and international fashion designers.\n\nActual residents do not use the term Uptown. That is reserved for city officials and/or realtors.\n\nThe Texas Medical Center, about three miles (5 km) south of the Midtown area is the largest medical complex in the world. Bordering the Texas Medical Center are Reliant Park to the south and the Rice University/Rice Village area to the west.\n\nThe Museum District comprises more than 20 institutions, Hermann Park, the Houston Zoo and the Miller Outdoor Theatre. It is one of the most visited museum districts in the country. The Museum District covers a radius around Mecom Fountain in Hermann Park.\n\nWhen Houston was established in 1837, the city's founders divided it into political geographic districts called \"wards.\" The ward designation is the progenitor of the nine current-day Houston City Council districts.\n\nMuch of the predominantly African American First Ward was demolished and renovated as part of a gentrification effort. Much of the district is bordered by Houston Avenue, Interstates 10 and 45, and Washington Avenue. Because of rising land values, houses formerly located in Third Ward, Neartown, the West End and West University Place were relocated from their former land parcels and rehabilitated.\nThe Second Ward, located east of downtown, was developed in the early 20th century. The Second Ward is predominantly a Hispanic community. The area has been undergoing gentrification due to its close proximity to downtown and entertainment venues. In the mid-to-late 2000s upper middle class residents moved into this East End area to take advantage of houses that are less expensive than west side houses. Second Ward is located in the East End district and is one of Houston's oldest neighborhoods.\n\nThe predominantly African American Third Ward, southeast of downtown, was home to one of the most affluent African American communities in the South after World War I. It is also where Texas Southern University and University of Houston are located. The Third Ward lies within two city council districts (D and I).\n\nThe Fourth Ward, known as Freedmen's Town for the freed slaves that settled there after the United States Civil War, was the first and most prominent African American community in Houston. It is home to the first campus of Booker T. Washington High School which was later moved to Independence Heights in northern Houston. Historically, the ward has been among the poorest areas of the inner-city, but is undergoing extensive gentrification because of its proximity to downtown. The ward included the Allen Parkway Village housing project, which was redeveloped into the Historic Oaks at Allen Parkway Village. The Freedmen's Town Historical District was created in 1988. Today, about 40 percent of the original wood-frame homes remain in the ward.\n\nThe Fifth Ward is another predominantly African American community originally settled by freed slaves. It too is undergoing gentrification. A section of the Fifth Ward, Frenchtown, once held the center of the Creole community in Houston .\n\nThe Sixth Ward is bounded by Memorial Drive to the south, Glenwood Cemetery to the west, Washington Avenue to the north, and Houston Avenue to the east. It was carved out of the Fourth Ward in 1877 as a residential area. There are many examples of Greek revival, Victorian, and Classical Revival architecture in the neighborhood, but due to extensive gentrification many are being demolished in favor of modern housing.\n\nThe Greenway Plaza business district is west of Midtown and southwest of Downtown Houston. The district is home to Lakewood Church, the country's largest megachurch.\n\nNeartown is an area located in west-central Houston, Texas and is one of the city's major cultural areas. The location has a distinctive character of eccentricity and a diverse population. The eastern–southeastern portion of Neartown (colloquially referred to as Montrose) is the center of Houston's gay and lesbian community, and known for its vintage shops, 1950s-style eateries and street art. The Neartown area traditionally hosted the Westheimer Street Festival, a colorful community gathering that was ended mostly due to gentrification. It is also the location of the Menil Collection and the University of Saint Thomas.\n\nThe historic Houston Heights, near downtown, has the highest point of elevation in the city. Like the smaller Woodland Heights neighborhood just to its east, it was originally a separate, independent suburb connected to Houston by streetcar. It was incorporated in 1891 and consolidated into the city of Houston in 1919. Even today it retains a ban on liquor sales and is a popular area for antique shopping. Like the neighboring Neartown, Houston Heights has long been a popular place for the artistic and gay and lesbian communities to live. Like other neighborhoods, the Heights has been experiencing gentrification pressures as the inner-loop grows, but residents concerned with historic preservation have resisted through the use of deed restrictions. Many of the Heights' Victorian houses and Craftsman bungalows are in high demand, especially those that have been remodeled. The Houston Heights is also home to the ArtCar Museum, a tourist attraction.\n\nRiver Oaks is the city's most affluent area, often compared to Beverly Hills. Beyond Houston, it is the wealthiest neighborhood in the entire state and is home to many celebrities and political figures. Situated as it is between downtown and Uptown, River Oaks is a collection of mansions in a sea of high-rise apartments and lofts. Near and partially blending into River Oaks, the areas of Highland Village and Upper Kirby are home to many high-end shopping and dining venues.\n\nTo the west is the Memorial Area. The zip code for Memorial (77024) is the sixth wealthiest in Texas. It contains the largest of a series of affluent municipalities separate from but surrounded by the city of Houston, known as the Villages, which include Hedwig Village, Bunker Hill Village, Hunters Creek Village, Piney Point Village, Hilshire Village, and Spring Valley Village\".\n\nClear Lake City is a master-planned community located in southeast Houston. It is home to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, the University of Houston–Clear Lake and a very large upper-middle class Asian American community. The area was annexed into the city of Houston in 1979. League City, just south of this area, is home to a few water-side resorts.\n\nTo the northeast is the master-planned community of Kingwood, which was annexed by the city of Houston in 1996.\nKingwood is the largest master-planned community in Harris County.\n\nIn addition to the \"island cities\" of Bellaire, West University Place, Southside Place and the Memorial Villages, there are several communities not part of Houston that are important to the metropolitan area.\n\nPasadena is Houston's most populous suburb and the former location of \"Gilley's\", the honky-tonk bar that inspired the hit 1980 movie Urban Cowboy, which was filmed in Pasadena. Because of its location skirting the ship channel where most of the city's refineries are located, Pasadena is considered the backbone of Houston's enormous petrochemical complex. The nearby cities of Baytown, La Porte, which is home to the San Jacinto Monument, and Channelview are also host to many refineries and chemical plants. Other nearby cities are Deer Park, Galena Park, and South Houston.\n\nKaty is about 30 minutes west of downtown. Manylive between Katy and Houstonthose areas have \"Katy\" addresses and are referred to as the \"Katy Area\", while the city proper is known as \"Old Katy\". Because of this, the \"Greater Katy\" area has a population of over 250,000. Several developments are located in this area, including Cinco Ranch, Kelliwood, and various other communities. Much of the Katy area borders the western portion of George Bush Park, and it is home to Katy Mills Mall. The Katy area also stretches into northern Fort Bend County as well as southeast Waller County.\n\nCypress is an unincorporated area about 30 minutes northwest of downtown. Originally a grouping of rice farms and forest, this area has seen tremendous growth since the 1980s, almost all of it single-family housing. Cypress is also home of Cy-Fair ISD, metro Houston's second-largest school district. Other cities to the northwest are Jersey Village, a bedroom community at the intersection of Beltway 8 and the Northwest Freeway, and Tomball, a city of around 25,000 at the edge of Harris County.\n\nBetween Cypress and Katy lies Bridgeland, a large development in the early stages of construction. At completion, the developers expect a population of 65,000 in the area.\n\nHumble, Texas is a town northeast of Downtown, adjacent to Bush Intercontinental Airport. Humble area has a sizable population, which includes Atascocita. While the city of Humble itself has a high crime rate, the area is one of the fastest and safest areas in Houston.\n\nSugar Land is a city southwest of Houston in northeast Fort Bend County, and is named for the former Imperial Sugar refinery. It is home to a number of international energy, software and product firms. It also is one of the fastest-growing and wealthiest cities in the state due to the numerous master-planned communities in the area, such as First Colony, New Territory, Greatwood, Sugar Creek, Sugar Lakes, Avalon, and Riverstone. Sugar Land has the most master-planned communities within Fort Bend County, which is home to the largest number of master-planned communities in the nation. Sugar Land ranked as the hottest place to live within the state of Texas and was third in the United States for 2006 according to \"Money\" magazine, with the city receiving honors for its quality government services, affordable housing, and diversity (around one-quarter of Sugar Land's residents are Asian-American).\n\nStafford lies between Sugar Land and Houston, straddling Fort Bend and Harris counties. Stafford is home to many corporate campuses due to the lack of a municipal property tax. The Stafford Municipal School District, run by the city, is the only school district in Texas run by a municipal government.\n\nIn 1890, the land that now comprises Missouri City was advertised for sale in St. Louis, Missouri and surrounding areas as \"a land of genial sunshine and eternal summer.\" Despite all the efforts to appeal to settlers from the \"north\", the first actual settlers came from Arlington, Texas – between Dallas and Fort Worth – in early 1894. Partially within Harris County, but mostly in neighboring Fort Bend County, the city boasts a large African American population. \"Mo City\", as it is sometimes called, has experienced significant \"white flight\". Most of this white flight has occurred in the northeastern portions of the city which are now predominantly black, and master-planned communities within the city such as Quail Valley and Lake Olympia boast significant white populations, and some of these communities have pockets of African-American and Asian-American residents. Sienna Plantation, an unincorporated community within Missouri City's extraterritorial jurisdiction, is culturally one with Missouri City.\n\nPearland is a city located south of Houston in Brazoria County with a small portion in Harris County. Pearland is the fastest-growing city in Brazoria County – it has increased from about 19,000 to 39,000 residents in the 1990s alone (based on 2000 U.S. Census figures). It has since increased from 39,000 to 82,000 since 2000. It is home to companies such as Weatherford and Aggreko. It is the closest suburb to Downtown Houston and the Texas Medical Center (about away), which attracts professionals from the oil, gas, energy, medical and aerospace industries. Some of the master-planned communities found in the area are Silverlake, Silvercreek, and Shadow Creek Ranch.\n\nThe Woodlands is a large master-planned community about north of Downtown Houston in Montgomery County. It is one of the largest and most popular master-planned communities in the country. Most of The Woodlands lies in the city of Houston's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) and the city limits of Shenandoah. Negotiations are under way with Houston and Conroe to the north to release The Woodlands from these ETJs and some in the community want The Woodlands to become a full city itself.\n\nA popular day trip may include Galveston to visit Moody Gardens or the sandy beach. Before near destruction in 1900 Galveston was larger and wealthier than Houston, dubbed \"The Wall Street of the Southwest\" and on par with New Orleans as the Gulf Coast's premier city. Galveston is also home to the new Schlitterbahn Waterpark. The waterpark is located across the street from Moody Gardens. Galveston's vulnerability on a narrow barrier bar island led to the creation of the Port of Houston, made by dredging the shallow Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay to form a protected port some 40 miles (64 km) inland of the open Gulf and less than 10 miles (16 km) from Houston's central business district. Beach houses owned by Houstonians have sprung up in other cities along the Gulf of Mexico's shoreline. Another tourist hot spot is Kemah where visitors see the Kemah Boardwalk, which has many seafood restaurants and local tourist attractions. Kemah is surrounded by Galveston Bay to the east and Clear Lake Shores (a brackish-water boater's paradise with open pass through to Galveston Bay) to the west.\n\nFive other cities lay along Interstate 45 on mainland Galveston County.

She was formerly a CBS News correspondent, and was their principal \"Ground Zero\" reporter during the morning of the September 11 attacks. In 2007 she joined MSNBC as an occasional anchor, and was subsequently chosen as co-host of \"Morning Joe\", alongside Joe Scarborough. She and Scarborough were married on November 24, 2018, with Rep. Elijah Cummings serving as the officiant.\n\nMika Brzezinski is a visiting fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. Her main political interest is in wage equality for women. She is also the author of three books; two on her career as a journalist and one on food addiction.\n\nBrzezinski is the daughter of diplomat and political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as adviser to both Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter.\n\nBrzezinski was born in New York City, the daughter of Polish-born foreign policy expert and former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski and Swiss-born sculptor Emilie Anna Benešová. Her mother, of Czech descent, is a grandniece of Czechoslovakia's former president Edvard Beneš. Her father was teaching at Columbia University when she was born; the family moved to McLean, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., in late 1976, when Zbigniew was named National Security Advisor by newly elected President Jimmy Carter. Her brother, Mark Brzezinski, is an American diplomat and was the United States Ambassador to Sweden from 2011 to 2015. Her second brother is military expert Ian Brzezinski. She is a first cousin of the author Matthew Brzezinski.\n\nBrzezinski attended the Madeira School and then enrolled at Georgetown University. During her junior year, she transferred to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1989.\n\nBrzezinski began her career in journalism as an assistant at ABC's \"World News This Morning\" in 1990. A year later, she moved to Tribune-owned Fox affiliate WTIC-TV/WTIC-DT in Hartford, Connecticut. There, she progressed from assignment and features editor to general assignments reporter. In 1992, she joined CBS affiliate WFSB-TV/WFSB-DT in Hartford and quickly progressed through the ranks to become its weekday morning anchor in 1995. In 1997, she left that role to join the CBS News, where she served as a correspondent and as anchor for the overnight \"Up to the Minute\" news program. In 2001, Brzezinski began a short hiatus from CBS News, during which she worked for rival MSNBC on the weekday afternoon show, \"HomePage,\" with co-anchors Gina Gaston and Ashleigh Banfield. \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the trio as \"the Powerpuff Girls of journalism\".\n\nShe returned to CBS News as a desk correspondent in September 2001, a move that thrust her into the limelight as a principal \"Ground Zero\" reporter for the September 11, 2001, attacks. Brzezinski was broadcasting live from the scene when the South Tower collapsed. In her last position at CBS News, Brzezinski served as a CBS News correspondent, substitute anchor, and segment anchor for breaking news segments and routine updates. During this period she became an occasional contributor to \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and \"60 Minutes.\" She was subsequently fired by CBS.\n\nBrzezinski returned to MSNBC on January 26, 2007, doing the evening \"Up to the Minute\" news updates. Then she worked primetime newsbreaks during the week. She also filed occasional reports for NBC Nightly News and appeared as an occasional anchor on \"Weekend Today\". Brzezinski resigned from both shows on the eve of a renewal option, said Brzezinski, when Scarborough selected her to co-host on \"Morning Joe\". Brzezinski said, \"I struggled to keep up with the live interaction broadcasting format at 6-9 am. I became more comfortable when I found myself having a primary function of reading the prompt for lead-ins and breaks. Mika, the 'hot anchor' was born. The producers slowly encouraged my participation in news reader segments that I was more at ease with. Geist and Joe slowly found me a capable news reader and the expansion of my role was a process. I was not pleased with the reference to being the 'hot anchor'.\"\n\nSince the program's inception, Brzezinski appeared as co-host and news reader on MSNBC's morning program \"Morning Joe\", alongside Joe Scarborough and Willie Geist.\n\nOn June 26, 2007, near the beginning of \"Morning Joe\", Brzezinski refused to read a report about Paris Hilton's release from jail. One hour later during another news break segment, her producer Andy Jones again pushed the story as the lead, ranking it over Indiana's Republican Senator Richard Lugar's break with President Bush on the Iraq War, which Brzezinski considered more important. After several sarcastic remarks from host Scarborough, she attempted to set the story's script on fire on the air, but was physically prevented from doing so by co-host Geist. She then tore up the script, and one hour later, got up and ran another copy of the script through a paper shredder retrieved from Dan Abrams's office. The incident was quickly popularized on the Internet, and in the days that followed, Brzezinski received large quantities of fan mail supporting her on-air protest as a commentary on the tension between \"hard news\" and \"entertainment news\". Similarly, on July 7, 2010, she objected on-air to pressure to report on Lindsay Lohan and Levi Johnston. Eventually, Geist and Pat Buchanan reported the stories with the caption, then popularized, \"News You Can't Use\".\n\nErik Wemple of the Washington Post criticized Brzezinski and co-host Scarborough for frequent phone interviews with Donald Trump during the 2016 Presidential campaign, even though much of \"Morning Joe\"'s coverage was critical of Trump's campaign.\n\nThe 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak revealed that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairperson of the Democratic National Committee, had emailed Chuck Todd, the Political Director of NBC News and host of \"Meet the Press\", to demand that he \"stop\" Brzezinski from criticizing the DNC's treatment of Bernie Sanders. In December 2016, after Clinton had lost, Brzezinski suggested the Clinton campaign had tried to silence her by calling executives at NBC and telling them she \"needed to be pulled off the air\".\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Brzezinski banned Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway from future appearances on her show. Brzezinski said, \"We know for a fact that [Conway] tries to book herself on this show. I won't do it. Because I don't believe in fake news, or information that is not true... every time I've ever seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect\". Her co-host Joe Scarborough said the decision to ban Conway from future appearances was based on her being \"out of the loop\" and \"in none of the key meetings\". \"She's not briefed. She's just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance\".\n\nOn February 15, 2017, \"Washington Post\" columnist Jennifer Rubin agreed that Conway should be banned from future television appearances. \"In recent days, George Stephanopoulos and Matt Lauer blasted her directly, essentially calling her a fabulist. Given all that, it would be irresponsible for any news show to put her out there, suggesting she really does not know what is going on at any given moment\", Rubin wrote. According to both Scarborough and Brzezinski, Conway is privately \"disgusted\" by her job and Donald Trump, and her words do not reflect her actual beliefs—though Conway disputed the claim.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted several times criticizing both Brzezinski and Scarborough. In March 2017, Brzezinski called Trump's presidency \"fake and failed\", and soon thereafter Trump unfollowed Brzezinski and Scarborough on Twitter.\n\nIn late June 2017, Brzezinski was again the target of Trump's tweets in which he called her \"low I.Q. Crazy Mika\" and asserted that she was \"bleeding badly from a face-lift\".\n\nBrzezinski and Scarborough then accused the White House of threatening to blackmail them with an exposé in a tabloid magazine unless the pair apologized publicly to the President.\n\nOn May 20, 2020, while hosting \"Morning Joe\", Brzezinski spoke out against Trump for tweeting a conspiracy theory that her husband Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of Lori Klausutis, an intern in Brzezinski's husband, Joe Scarborough's Florida office in 2001, while he was in Congress. Trump labelled Klausutis' death a \"cold case\" in his tweet. Klausutis was found dead at her desk in July 2001. An autopsy revealed an undiagnosed heart problem that caused her to lose consciousness and hit her head when she fell. During a live segment on \"Morning Joe\", Brzezinski stated \"Donald, you're a sick person. You're a sick person, to put this [Klausutis'] family through this, to put her husband through this, to do this just because you're mad at Joe, because Joe got you again today. Because he speaks the truth, and he speaks plainly about your lack of interest and empathy in others and your lack of ability to handle this massive human catastrophe (COVID-19), the fact that you have made it worse and you make it worse every day. And that you won't even wear a mask to protect people from your germs\". Brzezinski later announced in a tweet that she would be contacting Twitter about Trump's tweet, which she said violated their policies, and urged the platform to stop allowing their policies \"to be abused by the day\", citing Trump's tweet as libel, and further announced a call with the company was being arranged.\n\nOn May 26, 2020, the \"New York Times\" published an op-ed, containing a letter in which the husband of Lori Klausutis, Timothy Klausutis demanded Trump to stop exploiting his late wife and urged Twitter to take down the tweets. Klausutis wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey asking him to intervene and claimed Trump has violated Twitter's terms of service and \"has taken something that does not belong to him-the memory of my dead wife-and perverted it for perceived political gain\". Later, the same day, Trump posted two tweets seemingly adressing the letter, writing: \"The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought, this has been going on for years, long before I joined the chorus. In 2016 when Joe & his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking ... about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing? [...]\".\n\nOn December 12, 2018, Brzezinski called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \"a wannabe dictator's butt-boy\", referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, during a live MSNBC broadcast. She apologized later that day (as well as the next day) after her remarks were widely criticized as homophobic.\n\nOn October 23, 1993, Brzezinski married TV news reporter James Patrick Hoffer, now of WABC-TV. They met when both worked at WTIC-TV. They have two daughters, Emilie and Carlie Hoffer. Hoffer and Brzezinski divorced in 2016 amidst allegations of an affair between Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough.\n\nIn early 2017, Brzezinski became engaged to her co-host Joe Scarborough, and they were married on November 24, 2018 in Washington, D.C.\n\nBrzezinski has written three books, all of which were published by Weinstein Books. Her first book, \"All Things at Once\", was a memoir published in January 2010.\n\n\"Knowing Your Value: Women, Money and Getting What You're Worth,\" published in 2011, discusses women and financial negotiations. It includes tips for negotiating salaries and compensation packages. In 2018 this was revised, updated, and was released as \"Know Your Value\". Her third book, \"Obsessed: America's Food Addiction and My Own\", was published in 2012.\n\n\n"}

Thiladhunmathi was divided into its northern and southern divisions on May 21, 1958. The north division was integrated with Ihavandhippolhu forming administratively a new atoll called Haa Alif atoll or Thiladhumathi North. In total Haa Alif atoll contains 42 islands, 14 of which are inhabited.At present there are three Tourist resorts in the atoll. North Thiladhunmath is third largest atoll in the Maldives in terms of population and land area.\n\nThe atoll being at the north tip of the Maldives is the closest to Sri Lanka and India.\n\nNorthern Thiladhunmathi Atoll contains 42 islands, 16 of which are inhabited.\n\nNOTE: \"Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc. are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives.

The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).\"\n\nIn Matheerah there is a famous shrine (ziyaraiy, mausoleum) which was visited formerly by the Maldive kings and their families in order to seek blessings. Such tomb visits are aspects of Sufism that existed among the Maldivians until very recent times. Hence this island was referred to with the honorific title Matheerahffulhu (High (noble) Island) by the Sufi Muslims of the Maldives at that time.\n\nTraditionally the northernmost atoll of the Maldives was Minicoy (Maliku). Fishermen from Thuraakunu and from Minicoy often crossed the Maliku Kandu on their boats to visit each other's islands. Marriage alliances were common. Now Minicoy is a part of India and communication is highly restricted.\n\n"}

A BFP must purchase for value, meaning that he or she must pay for the property rather than simply be the beneficiary of a gift. Even when a party fraudulently conveys property to a BFP (for example, by selling to the BFP property that has already been conveyed to someone else), that BFP will, depending on the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, take good (valid) title to the property despite the competing claims of the other party. As such, an owner publicly recording his or her own interests (which in some types of property must be on a court-recognised Register) protects himself or herself from losing those to an indirect buyer, such as a qualifying buyer from a thief, who qualifies as a BFP. Moreover, so-called \"race-notice\" jurisdictions require the BFP himself or herself to record (depending on the type of property by public notice or applying for registration) to enforce his or her rights. In any case, parties with a claim to ownership in the property will retain a cause of action (a right to sue) against the party who made the fraudulent conveyance.\n\nIn England and Wales and in other jurisdictions following the 20th century oft-repeated precedent, the BFP will not be bound by equitable interests of which he/she does not have actual, constructive or imputed notice, as long as he/she has made \"such inspections as ought reasonably to have been made\".\n\nBFPs are also sometimes referred to as \"equity's darling\". However, jurist Hackney explains the portrayal is inaccurate; in cases where legal title is passed to a \"bona fide\" purchaser for value without notice, it is not so much that equity has any great affection for the purchaser – it is simply that equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held by the former beneficial owner of the property. The relationship between the courts of equity and the BFP is at root characterised as, geared toward the BFP, with benign neglect of the old owner(s). However, equity allows a proven BFP to claim for a full legal conveyance from former legal owner, failing which the court itself will convey title.\n\nIn the United States, the patent law codifies the \"bona fide\" purchaser rule, . Unlike the common law, the statute cuts off both equitable \"and\" legal claims to the title.\n\n"}

It was used as the basis for a very successful and highly regarded 1938 recording by Ella Fitzgerald, composed by Fitzgerald in conjunction with Al Feldman (later known as Van Alexander). \nIt has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 13188.\n\nThe rhyme was first noted in the United States in 1879 as a children's rhyming game. It was sung while children danced in a circle. One of the number ran on the outside of the circle and dropped a handkerchief. The nearest child would then pick it up and chase the dropper. If caught, the dropper either was kissed, joined the circle, or had to tell the name of their sweetheart. An early noted version had the lyrics:\n\nIn some variants, the second line is \"I lost my yellow basket\".\nIn other variants, the last line is \"A little girl picked it up and put it in her pocket\".\n\nIn nineteenth-century England, the rhyme used in the same game had somewhat different but evidently related words:\n\nElla Fitzgerald, in conjunction with Al Feldman (later known as Van Alexander), extended and embellished the rhyme into a jazz piece that was her breakthrough hit with the Chick Webb Orchestra in 1938. It has since become a jazz standard. The lyrics changed the color of the basket to brown and yellow. In Ella's version a little girl picks up the note and then takes the basket after it is carelessly left on the ground.\nA follow-up song written by Fitzgerald and Webb entitled \"I Found My Yellow Basket\" (1938) was less successful.\n\nThe song was a major hit of the \"pre-chart\" era, reaching number one in Billboard's sheet music and Record Buying Guide (jukebox) charts, also number 1 on \"Your Hit Parade\".\n\nBing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album \"On the Happy Side\" (1962).\n\nLines from the song have been mentioned by Stevie Ray Vaughan, Half Man Half Biscuit, Ganksta N-I-P, Shangri-Las, Scarface, Eminem, Madonna, and Boondox.\nNabisco did a take-off of the song for its ad campaign in the 70's, with the lyrics \"A Trisquit, A Trisquit, Baked only by Nabisco.\"\n\nCurly Howard recites a paraphrase of the (non-musical) rhyme in The Three Stooges short \"We Want Our Mummy\" (1939).\n\nThe music for the song was used in the opening scene of John Ford's 1940 film \"The Grapes of Wrath\" to help establish the contemporary time frame of the events of the film.\n\nElla Fitzgerald performed the song in the Abbott and Costello film, \"Ride 'Em Cowboy\" (1942).\n\nA rendition of the song was also performed in the Paul Thomas Anderson movie \"The Master\" (2012).\n"}

{"id": "2277747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277747", "title": "Metal clay", "text": "Metal clay\n\nMetal clay is a crafting medium consisting of very small particles of metal such as silver, gold, bronze, or copper mixed with an organic binder and water for use in making jewelry, beads and small sculptures. Originating in Japan in 1990, metal clay can be shaped just like any soft clay, by hand or using molds. After drying, the clay can be fired in a variety of ways such as in a kiln, with a handheld gas torch, or on a gas stove, depending on the type of clay and the metal in it. The binder burns away, leaving the pure sintered metal. Shrinkage of between 8% and 30% occurs (depending on the product used). Alloys such as bronze, sterling silver, and steel also are available.\n\nMetal clay first came out in Japan in 1990 to allow craft jewelry makers to make sophisticated looking jewelry without the years of study needed to make fine jewelry.\n\nFine silver metal clay results in objects containing 99.9% pure silver, which is suitable for enameling. Lump metal clay is sold in sealed packets to keep it moist and workable. The silver versions are also available as a softer paste in a pre-filled syringe which can be used to produce extruded forms, in small jars of slip and as paper-like sheets, from which most of the moisture has been removed. Common brands of silver metal clay include Precious Metal Clay (PMC) and Art Clay Silver (ACS).\n\nMetal clay artists looking for more strength in their silver creations can also mix PMC fine silver clay with an equal part of PMC Sterling clay. The firing of this alloy is found to be up to for two hours.\n\nAnother available alloy, EZ960 Sterling Silver Metal Clay was invented by Bill Struve from Metal Adventures, the inventor of BRONZclay™ and COPPRclay™. Because the clay is a sterling silver alloy, one of its best attributes is its post firing strength, in comparison to fine silver. This clay is fired open shelf on a raised hard ceramic kiln shelf at for 2 hours, full ramp. No carbon required. Its shrinkage rate is smaller than other clays, at 10–11%.\n\nPMC was developed in the early 1990s in Japan by metallurgist Masaki Morikawa. As a solid-phase sintered product of a precious metal powder used to form a precious metal article, the material consists of microscopic particles of pure silver or fine gold and a water-soluble, non-toxic, organic binder that burns off during firing. Success was first achieved with gold and later duplicated with silver. \nThe PMC brand includes the following products:\n\nACS was developed by AIDA Chemical Industries, also a Japanese company. ACS followed PMC Standard with their Art Clay Original clay (more like PMC+ than PMC Standard), which allows the user to fire with a handheld torch or on a gas hob. Owing to subtle differences in the binder and suggested firing times, this clay shrinks less than the PMC versions, approximately 8–10%.\n\nFurther developments introduced the Art Clay Slow Dry, a clay with a longer working time. Art Clay 650 and Art Clay 650 Slow Dry soon followed; both clays can be fired at , allowing the user to combine the clay with glass and sterling silver, which are affected negatively by the higher temperatures needed to fire the first generation clays. AIDA also manufacturers Oil Paste, a product used only on fired metal clay or milled fine silver, and Overlay Paste, which is designed for drawing designs on glass and porcelain.\n\nIn 2006 AIDA introduced the Art Clay Gold Paste, a more economical way to work with gold. The paste is painted onto the fired silver clay, then refired in a kiln, or with a torch or gas stove. When fired, it bonds with the silver, giving a 22-carat gold accent. The same year also saw Art Clay Slow Tarnish introduced, a clay that tarnishes less rapidly than the other metal clays.\n\nLump metal clay in bronze was introduced in 2008 by Metal Adventures Inc. and in 2009 by Prometheus. Lump metal clays in copper were introduced in 2009 by Metal Adventures Inc. and Aida. Because of the lower cost, the bronze and copper metal clays are used by artists more often than the gold and silver metal clays in the American market place. The actual creation time of a bronze or copper piece is also far greater than that of its silver counterpart. Base metal clays, such as bronze, copper, and steel metal clays are best fired in the absence of oxygen to eliminate the oxidation of the metal by atmospheric oxygen. A means to accomplish this –- to place the pieces in activated carbon inside a container – was developed by Bill Struve.\n\nMetal clays are also available as dry powders to which water is added to hydrate and kneaded to attain a clay consistency. One advantage to the powders is their unlimited shelf life. The first silver clay in powder form was released in 2006 as Silver Smiths' Metal Clay Powder. In the following years base metal clays by Hadar Jacobson and Goldie World released several variation containing copper, brass, and even steel.\n"}

Brown began working on the album after being discovered by the production team Trackmasters and appearing on a number of singles by other artists, such as LL Cool J, Case and Jay Z. The immediate success of the singles led to a bidding war at the beginning of 1996, and in March, Def Jam Recordings won and signed the then 17-year-old rapper to the label. Mostly produced by Trackmasters, \"Ill Na Na\" features guest appearances from Blackstreet, Havoc, Method Man, Kid Capri and Jay Z. Lyrically, the album mainly focuses on themes of fashion, sex and mafia.\n\nReleased exactly one week after Lil' Kim's debut album \"Hard Core\", the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, heavily comparing the two albums. \"Ill Na Na\" debuted at number seven on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 109,000 copies sold in its first week.

{"id": "2277773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277773", "title": "Removable partial denture", "text": "Removable partial denture\n\nA removable partial denture (RPD) is a denture for a partially edentulous patient who desires to have replacement teeth for functional or aesthetic reasons and who cannot have a bridge (a fixed partial denture) for any reason, such as a lack of required teeth to serve as support for a bridge (i.e. distal abutments) or financial limitations.\nThis type of prosthesis is referred to as a \"removable partial denture\" because patients can remove and reinsert it when required without professional help. Conversely, a \"fixed\" prosthesis can and should be removed only by a dental professional.\n\nThe patient's oral condition is categorized based on the remaining dentition in a classification first proposed by Dr. Edward Kennedy in 1925. His classification consisted of four general outlines for partially edentulous arches that can present within a patient, which then could be treated with an RPD. When there is an edentulous space that is outside of the four classifications, it is termed a modification space. The use of this classification allows for easier communication between dental professionals, allows for easily visualization of the arch, and distinguishes a tooth-borne or tissue-supported RPD.\n\n\nKennedy Class I RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some or all of their posterior teeth on both sides (left \"and\" right) in a single arch (either mandibular or maxillary), and there are no teeth posterior to the edentulous area. In other words, Class I RPDs clasp onto teeth that are more towards the front of the mouth, while replacing the missing posterior teeth on both sides with false denture teeth. The denture teeth are composed of either plastic or porcelain.\n\nClass II RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some or all of their posterior teeth on one side (left \"or\" right) in a single arch, and there are no teeth behind the edentulous area. Thus, Class II RPDs clasp onto teeth that are more towards the front of the mouth, as well as on teeth that are more towards the back of the mouth of the side on which teeth are not missing, while replacing the missing more-back-of-the-mouth teeth on one side with false denture teeth.\n\nClass III RPDs are fabricated for people who are missing some teeth in such a way that the edentulous area has teeth remaining both posterior and anterior to it. Unlike Class I and Class II RPDs which are both tooth-and-tissue-borne (meaning they both clasp onto teeth, as well as rest on the posterior edentulous area for support), Class III RPDs are strictly tooth-borne, which means they only clasp onto teeth and do not need to rest on the tissue for added support. This makes Class III RPDs exceedingly more secure as per the three rules of removable prostheses that will be mentioned later, namely: support, stability and retention. (See the article on dentures for a more thorough review of these three fundamentals of removable prosthodontics.)\n\nHowever, if the edentulous area described in the previous paragraph crosses the anterior midline (that is, at least both central incisors are missing), the RPD is classified as a Class IV RPD. By definition, a Kennedy Class IV RPD design will possess only one edentulous area.\n\nClass I, II and III RPDs that have multiple edentulous areas in which replacement teeth are being placed are further classified with modification states that were defined by Oliver C. Applegate. Kennedy classification is governed by the most posterior edentulous area that is being restored. Thus if, for example, a maxillary arch is missing teeth #1, 3, 7-10 and 16, the RPD would be Kennedy Class III mod 1. It would not be Class I, because missing third molars are generally not restored in an RPD (although if they were, the classification would indeed be Class I), and it would not be Class IV, because modification spaces are not allowed for Kennedy Class IV.\n\nThe results of a study conducted in Saudi Arabia, showed that the occurrence of Kennedy Class III partial edentulism was 67.2% in the maxillary arch and 64.1% in the mandibular arch. Followed by Class II in both maxillary and mandibular arch with an average of 16.3% in maxillary arch and 14.8% in the mandibular arch. Based on these results, class III has the highest prevalence in younger group of patient (31– 40 years). Class I and class II have the highest incidence among older group of Patients (41–50 years).\n\nPrior to designing partial dentures a complete examination is undertaken to assess the condition of remaining teeth. This may involve radiographs, sensibility testing or other assessments. From this examination and assessment of occlusion (occlusal plane, drifting, tilting of teeth and surveyed articulated casts) the designing of partial dentures can begin. Information from previous dentures can be very useful in deciding which features to keep the same and which features of the design to change – in the hope of making an improvement.\n\nA systematic design process should be followed:\n\n·      the teeth to be replaced must be decided.\n\n·      the soft tissue to be replaced (flange) is then drawn.\n\n·      the major connector is selected from a list of options (the options available will depend on the above assessment).\n\n·      retentive features of the denture must be decided – these may include clasps, guide planes and indirect retention (often important in dentures involving Kennedy Class 1 and Class 2 saddles).\n\n·      supportive features are then decided – these prevent the denture sinking into the soft tissue; often the natural teeth can take some of the loading (rest seats and connector coverage).\n\nHowever, this is not always possible. Support may thus be tooth-borne, mucosal borne or a combination of tooth and mucosal borne.\n\n·      the denture should where possible have features that withstand horizontal movement (bracing) and the clasps should have appropriate reciprocation.\n\n·      the denture base material (usually acrylic or cobalt-chromium) and materials of the various components must be selected.\n\n·      the hygiene of the prosthesis must be appropriate trying where possible to minimise the soft tissues coverage.\n\nThe design should be reviewed and simplified removing unnecessary components.\n\nOnce the partial denture has been designed, the shade and mould of the replacement teeth can be selected. Within the design process (and prior to the master impression stage of denture construction), modifications may be suggested to teeth. This may be undertaken to create occlusal space for rest seats or to create undercuts for the placement of clasps (such as addition of composite resin) or to create guide planes for easier insertion and removal of the denture.\n\nRather than lying entirely on the edentulous ridge like complete dentures, removable partial dentures possess clasps of cobalt-chrome or titanium metal or plastic that \"clip\" onto the remaining teeth, making the RPD more stable and retentive.\n\nThe parts of an RPD can be listed as follows (and are exemplified by the picture above):\n\n\nUpper connectors\n\nThere are many options for major connectors for removable upper partial dentures. The type of connector used will vary depending on the specific circumstances and the results of a comprehensive examination and discussion with the patient. Commonly used major connectors are outlined in the table below along with details of factors affecting the choice of using them.\n\nPlate\n\nAdvantages of plates are that they are useful when several teeth are missing or there are multiple saddle. They also provide more retention, stability and support due to larger palatal coverage. Plates are useful when there are long distal extensions. \nDisadvantages of plates are that they overs a lot of patients mouth so sometimes not well tolerated and also may affect phonetics. Plates can be problematic if there is a torus palatinus.\n\nPalatal bar (Strap/ Anterior-Posterior)\n\nAdvantages of these are their rigidity and minimal soft tissue coverage yet still having good resistance to deformation. A-P strap useful for Kennedy class I and II or if there is a torus. A-P strap gives greater distribution of stresses.\n\nDisadvantages of these are that there is not much support due to less palatal coverage and also that is it bulky and so disliked by some patients.\n\nU-shaped palatal bar (horseshoe connector)\n\nAdvantages of these are that they are useful in cases where we do not want to cover much of the palate e.g. if patient has a strong gag reflex, a large palatal torus or Kennedy class III.\n\nDisadvantages of these are that they are flexible due to distal extensions which can have adverse effects on force transmission to abutment teeth. They can traumatic to the residual ridge.\n\nSpoon denture\n\nAdvantages of these are that they are useful in small  anterior saddles and are cheap to make.\n\nDisadvantages of these are that they have large palatal coverage for a small saddle.\n\nPalatal Strap/Bar (Single/ Anterior, mid or Posterior)\n\nAdvantages of these are that single strap is useful for Kennedy class III and IV cases.\n\nDisadvantage of these are that single strap requires careful  placement  if there is a torus palatinus. They are generally inappropriate for Kennedy Class 1 or 2.\n\nA major connector is the part of a partial denture that links components on one side of the arch with those on the other. It must be strong and rigid enough to provide a suitable skeleton to the prosthesis and located so as not to damage the gingival or movable tissues. Five types of major connectors are listed below:\n\n   A lingual bar has a pear-shaped cross section tapering towards the gingival boundary. It should be positioned high enough so as to not irritate the lower movable tissue but low enough to allow for a substantial quantity of material to be used to ensure stiffness. At least 7mm of space is usually required. It sits on the soft tissue posteriorly to the dentition. Along with the lingual plate it is the most commonly used type of connector in the lower arch.\n\nA lingual bar is more hygienic than a lingual plate but is difficult to add to if teeth are later extracted and require to be added to the denture.\n   Sublingual bar- A sublingual bar is similar to a lingual bar but is located on the floor of the mouth posteriorly and inferiorly to its usual location. They are used when the superior border of a lingual bar would be positioned too closely to the gingival border. They are contraindicated in patients with a high lingual frenum and in situations where they may interfere with tongue movements.\nLingual Plate\n\n   A lingual plate is a thin plate contoured to the lingual surfaces of the lower anterior teeth. A lingual plate is useful when there is insufficient space for a lingual bar which would result in irritation of the gingival boundary.\n\nIf the teeth are spaced out and the patient does not wish for visible metal to be seen then an interrupted lingual plate may be used where the material is cut away where it would be visible anteriorly.\n\nA disadvantage of a lingual plate is that it covers a lot of gingival margins and is less hygienic than a lingual bar. It should be used with caution in those patients with a high caries rate. A major advantage is that is easier to add teeth to a denture with a lingual plate than a lingual bar connector. In addition, it is useful in providing some additional support for mobile lower anterior teeth.\nIn rare cases where the inclination of the remaining anterior teeth is problematic and the use of a lingual connector inappropriate, a buccal bar can be considered.  \n  Continuous Clasp- A continuous clasp is sometimes used in addition to a lingual bar and rarely as a sole major connector. It involves a bar of material placed along the cingulum of the anterior dentition.\n\nThe continuous clasp has the added advantage of providing indirect retention when used in addition to a lingual bar. It may be used when a lingual plate is compromising aesthetics.\n----[AP1]The picture shows 2 teeth being replaced so best to alter wording\n\nDirect retainers may come in various designs:\n\nBoth cast circumferential and wrought wire clasps are \"supra bulge clasps,\" in that they engage an undercut on the tooth by originating coronal to the height of contour, while Roach clasps are \"infrabulge clasps\" and engage undercuts by approaching from the gingival.\n\nIn addition there are a couple of specific theories which include the clasp design:\n\n Indirect retention is required to prevent displacement of saddles, such as free-end saddles or anterior saddle which is curved outside a straight line between the abutment teeth. Such indirect retention can only be achieved where both claps and rests work together to form lever system (Class III lever system) to retain the free part of denture.\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

In 1951, Binder directed two short films in the obscure \"Meet Mister Baby\" series; these films were preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2015. He did his first film title design for Stanley Donen's \"Indiscreet\" (1958). The Bond producers first approached him after being impressed by his title designs for the Donen comedy film \"The Grass Is Greener\" (1960). Binder also provided sequences for Donen for \"Charade\" (1963) and \"Arabesque\" (1966), both accompanying music by Henry Mancini.\n\nBinder created the signature gun barrel sequence for the opening titles of the first Bond film, \"Dr. No\" (1962). Binder originally planned to employ a camera sighted down the barrel of a .38 calibre gun, but this caused some problems. Unable to stop down the lens of a standard camera enough to bring the entire gun barrel into focus, Binder created a pinhole camera to solve the problem and the barrel became crystal clear.\n\nBinder described the genesis of the gun barrel sequence in the last interview he recorded before he died in 1991:\n\nAt least one critic has also observed that the sequence recalls the gun fired at the audience at the end of \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903). Binder is also known for featuring women performing a variety of activities such as dancing, jumping on a trampoline, or shooting weapons in his work. Both sequences are trademarks and staples of the James Bond films. Maurice Binder was succeeded by Daniel Kleinman as the title designer for \"GoldenEye\" (1995).\n\nPrior to \"GoldenEye\", the only James Bond movies for which he did not create the opening title credits were \"From Russia with Love\" (1963) and \"Goldfinger\" (1964), both of which were designed by Robert Brownjohn.\n\nBinder shot opening and closing sequences involving a mouse (an animal that didn't appear in either the novel or the film) for \"The Mouse That Roared\" (1959), a sequence of monks filmed as a mosaic explaining the history of the Golden Bell in \"The Long Ships\" (1963), and a sequence of Spanish dancers explaining why the then topical reference of nuclear weapons vanishing in a B-52 mishap shifted from Spain to Greece in \"The Day the Fish Came Out\" (1967).\n\nHe designed the title sequence for \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" (1963) that featured an orgy (the only one in the film). He took three days to direct the sequence that was originally supposed to take one day.\n\nBinder also was a producer of \"The Passage\" (1979), and a visual consultant on \"Dracula\" (1979) and \"Oxford Blues\" (1984).\n\nBinder died from lung cancer in London, aged 72.\n\n\n\n"}

The seller retains legal title of the property prior to the date of conveyance, but this land interest is considered personal property (a right to the payment of money, rather than a right to the property). The risk of loss is then transferred to the buyerif a house on the property burns down after the contract has been signed, but before the deed is conveyed, the buyer will nevertheless have to pay the agreed-upon purchase price for the land unless the seller in possession or deemed in possession has failed to protect it. Such issues can and should be avoided by parties by stipulating in the contract who will bear the loss in such occurrences. The above rule varies by jurisdiction, but is the general rule.\n\nIf one of the parties dies after the contract for sale of the property has been executed, the doctrine will govern how that party's interest will pass to his heirs. For example, the seller wills his real property to his son, and his personal property to his daughter. If the seller dies after a contract for conveyance is signed by a buyer, the seller's interest in the land will be treated as personal property, and the proceeds of the sale will pass to his daughter. In most jurisdictions, the real property interest created by the contract will pass to the buyer's heirs, while the seller's personal property interest created by the contract will pass to the seller's estate.\n\nThe State of New York does not recognize equitable conversion. In New York, as long as the buyer is without fault, the risk of loss remains on the seller until the buyer takes title or possession.\n\nA growing minority of States have adopted the Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (UVPRA) in one form or another. The UVPRA bases the legal consequences of no-fault casualty loss on the right of possession of the property at the time the loss occurs. See Brush Grocery Kart v. Sure Fine Market, 47 P. 3d 680 (Colo. 2002). Generally, the provisions of the UVPRA can be modified or avoided in the Land Sale Contract.\n\nIn Massachusetts and a handful of other states, the seller continues to bear the risk until the title is actually transferred to the buyer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary. See Brush Grocery Kart v. Sure Fine Market, 47 P. 3d 680 (Colo. 2002).\n"}

{"id": "2277799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277799", "title": "Hampton National Historic Site", "text": "Hampton National Historic Site\n\nHampton National Historic Site, in the Hampton area north of Towson, Baltimore County, Maryland, USA, preserves a remnant of a vast 18th-century estate, including a Georgian manor house, gardens, grounds, and the original stone slave quarters. The estate was owned by the Ridgely family for seven generations, from 1745 to 1948. The Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in America when it was completed in 1790 and today is considered to be one of the finest examples of Georgian architecture in the U.S. Its furnishings, together with the estate's slave quarters and other preserved structures, provide insight into the life of late 18th-century and early 19th-century landowning aristocracy. In 1948, Hampton was the first site selected as a National Historical Site for its architectural significance by the U.S. National Park Service. The grounds were widely admired in the 19th century for their elaborate parterres or formal gardens, which have been restored to resemble their appearance during the 1820s. Several trees are more than 200 years old. In addition to the mansion and grounds, visitors may tour the overseer's house and slave quarters.\n\nThe property was originally part of the Northampton land grant given to Col. Henry Darnall (c. 1645–1711), a relative of Lord Baltimore, in 1695. His heirs sold the land on April 2, 1745, to Col. Charles Ridgely (1702–72), a tobacco farmer and trader. The bill of sale records that the property included \"... houses, tobacco houses (tobacco barns), stables, gardens, and orchards.\" By the late 1750s, Hampton extended to more than and included an ironworks. His son, Capt. Charles Ridgely (1733–90), expanded the family business considerably to include gristmills, apple orchards, and stone quarries. During the American Revolutionary War, the ironworks was a significant source of income for the Ridgelys, producing cannons and ammunition for the Continental Army. In 1783, Capt. Ridgely began construction of the main house, Hampton Mansion. He said its concept was inspired by Castle Howard in England, owned by relatives of his mother. When it was completed in 1790, the Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in the United States.\n\nWhen Capt. Ridgely died that same year, his nephew, Charles Carnan Ridgely (1760–1829), became the second master of Hampton. He had of irrigation pipes laid in 1799 from a nearby spring to provide water to the Mansion and the surrounding gardens, which he was extensively developing. Prominent artisans of the time were hired to design geometric formal gardens, which were planted on the Mansion's grounds between 1799 and 1801. An avid horseman, Charles Carnan also began raising Thoroughbred horses at Hampton, where he had a racetrack installed. A 1799 advertisement promoted the stud services of his racehorse, Grey Medley. Another of Ridgely's racehorses, Post Boy, won the Washington City Jockey Club cup.\n\nUnder Charles Carnan Ridgely, Hampton reached its peak of in the 1820s. The mansion overlooked a grand estate of orchards, ironworks, coal mining, marble quarries, mills, and mercantile interests. The vast farm produced corn, beef cattle, dairy products, hogs, and horses. More than 300 slaves worked the fields and served the household, making Hampton one of Maryland's largest slaveholding estates. Six parterres were designed on three terraced levels facing the mansion, planted with roses, peonies, and seasonal flowers. In 1820, an orangery was built on the grounds.\n\nCharles Carnan Ridgely frequently entertained prominent guests in the Mansion's 51 ft. x 21 ft. (16 m by 6.4 m) Great Hall, such as Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Revolutionary War general, the Marquis de Lafayette. Charles Carnan served as governor of Maryland between 1816–19. When Governor Ridgely died in 1829, he freed Hampton's slaves in his will.\n\nThe Hampton estate was split among various heirs, with his son, John Carnan Ridgely inheriting the mansion and . The ironworks closed and thereafter the Ridgelys' income was primarily derived from farming, investments, and their stone quarries. John Carnan added plumbing, heating, and gas lighting to the mansion.\n\nEliza Ridgely John's wife and the subject of Thomas Sully's famous portrait, \"Lady with a Harp\", purchased many artworks and furnishings for the mansion. She was a noted horticulturist and had successively larger and more elaborate gardens cultivated on the grounds, with a large variety of flowers and shrubs grown in the estate's greenhouses and tended by some of the 60 slaves purchased by John Carnan Ridgely. By the mid-19th century, the Hampton estate had one of the most extensive collections of citrus trees in the U.S., along with various exotic trees and plants gathered by Eliza Ridgely during her frequent travels to Europe and the Orient. In the warm months, the potted citrus plants were brought outside and arranged around the terraced gardens, then taken into the heated orangery during the winter. She had one section of the garden planted with colorful red, yellow, pink, and maroon coleus from Asia. In 1859, Hampton's fame for lavish style was such that the author of a book on landscaping wrote, \"It has been truly said of Hampton that it expresses more grandeur than any other place in America\".\n\nIn January 1861, shortly after the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, Charles Ridgely (the son of John Carnan and Eliza Ridgely) formed the pro-Confederate Baltimore County Horse Guards at Hampton with himself as captain of the militia unit that he described as \"states' rights gentlemen.\" One of his militia's cavalry men, Lieut. John Merryman, was subsequently arrested by the Union Army and imprisoned in May 1861 on a charge of treason, sparking the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, \"Ex parte Merryman\". As the Civil War raged across the farmlands of Maryland and Pennsylvania at the Battle of Antietam (1862) and the Battle of Gettysburg (1863), the Ridgelys' Hampton estate remained untouched.\n\nAlthough Maryland, as a border state, was exempted from Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, the Maryland General Assembly eliminated slavery in 1864. With the end of slavery, Hampton began to decline. A number of the former slaves continued to work at Hampton as paid household servants but the Ridgelys had to hire other hands to work the farm. With the deaths of John and Eliza in 1867, their son Charles became the next master of Hampton. The mansion and the remaining were subsequently inherited upon Charles' death in 1872 by Captain John Ridgely Prominent guests, including Theodore Roosevelt, continued to visit Hampton and enjoy its grounds.\n\nAs nearby Baltimore grew and local agriculture declined, the Ridgelys found it increasingly difficult to maintain the property. Five of the six parterres were removed and replanted as a grass lawn. Some income was generated by producing cider from the estate's apple orchards and operating a dairy. In 1929, Capt. John Ridgely and his son, John Ridgely Jr., formed the Hampton Development Corporation and sold some of the remaining of land. In 1938, John Ridgely, Jr. (1882–1959) became the sixth generation of the family to become master of Hampton. His company sold off large portions of the estate to a suburban housing development in the 1930s and 1940s, now known as the fashionable Hampton residential community. The Hampton Mansion remained in the Ridgely family until 1948, when John Ridgely Jr. moved to the smaller Farm House on the property and the Mansion was acquired by the Avalon Foundation (now part of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation). The seventh and last generation of Ridgelys to live at the mansion was his son, John Ridgely III , who, after marrying Lillian Ketchum in the mid-1930s, continued to reside at the mansion with his wife until they both entered Army service during World War II.\n\nThe Hampton Mansion and remaining of the Ridgely estate were designated a National Historic Site by the Secretary of the Interior on June 22, 1948—the first site to be so selected on the basis of its historical significance and \"outstanding merit as an architectural monument\". Hampton Mansion was opened to the public in May 1949 under the care of Preservation Maryland for the next thirty years (1949–79). Work also began in 1949 to restore four of the site's six 19th-century parterres. On October 15, 1966, Hampton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In October 1979, it was acquired by the National Park Service (NPS), which has operated and managed the estate since. The NPS subsequently acquired additional acreage containing original Ridgely structures, bringing the park to its present size. In 1998, the NPS stated its purpose for the historic site:\n\nAs part of the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS in 1998 for the estate's long-term planning and operation, the NPS began studying the mansion's security, safety, electrical systems, and environmental issues in 2000. Critical needs were identified, such as the lack of a fire suppression system and climate control. Conservators of the property's furnishings and paintings said that the need to stabilize temperature and humidity levels inside the mansion was \"urgent due to unacceptable environmental stress\". The NPS finalized plans in 2004, including an environmental impact assessment, for installation of a modern HVAC system and a concealed fire sprinkler system to protect the historic mansion and its irreplaceable contents from loss by fire.\n\nStarting in January 2005, the mansion closed for almost three years as it underwent the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, the drawing room and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. The ornate cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.\n\nThe Park Service's chief ranger for the Hampton National Historic Site said afterwards of the $3 million in renovations, \"I don't think the mansion has ever looked better\". \"Preservation Maryland\", a statewide preservation advocacy organization, conferred its \"Stewardship Award\" in 2007 on the Hampton National Historic Site for refurnishing the mansion's rooms with historical accuracy while unobtrusively installing the fire suppression and climate control systems.\n\nThe remaining estate, straddling Hampton Lane, is now managed by the National Park Service and open to the public, with ample free parking, a gift shop, and wheelchair accessibility at the mansion. Visitors are provided a guided tour of the mansion, where the original furnishings owned by the Ridgelys may be seen, along with the family's collection of oil paintings, silverware, and ceramics comprising some 7,000 objects. In addition to the mansion itself, visitors may view nine surviving original structures on the grounds built during the 18th to mid-19th century period:\n\nSelf-guided tours may be made of the grounds during hours when the park is open to the public, including the farm, formal garden, family cemetery, and two stables built of stone for the Ridgely family's thoroughbred horses. A replica of the original orangery (built in 1824) may also be viewed (the original wooden orangery, which burned down in 1926, was reconstructed on the original foundations in 1976). One surviving deep underground icehouse is visible near the mansion and is open to visitors. Among the surviving trees planted by the Ridgelys in the 1820s are a large tulip tree, a European Beech, and Catalpas. A prize Cedar of Lebanon, brought back from the Middle East as a seedling by Eliza Ridgely, is one of the largest in the U.S.\n\nNumerous special events are scheduled throughout the year, such as chamber music concerts and harpsichord performances presented in the mansion's ornate Great Hall, milking demonstrations at the dairy by costumed milkmaids, carriage rides, hay harvesting by scythe, corn harvesting, blacksmithing demonstrations, and jousting reenactments. \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported that Hampton had 35,000 visitors in 2008.\n\nThe local community actively supports the site's preservation through a non-profit friends' group, \"Historic Hampton,\" which has assisted the National Park Service in achieving historical accuracy and interpretive potential of the interiors, along with presentation of various activities. In May 2008, a $195,000 challenge grant was announced by the National Park Service, matched by an equal amount to be raised by Historic Hampton, for further restoration of the mansion's interiors. The National Park Service also maintains an on-site archive of Ridgely family papers from 1750–1990 for researchers.\n\nWhen the Hampton estate first opened to the public in 1949, the mansion's kitchen was converted into a small restaurant. Known as the Tea Room, it was operated by a concessionaire for the next 50 years, serving lunches featuring Hampton Imperial Crab (backfin lump meat from the blue crab, baked and seasoned with spices) and other Chesapeake Bay seafood delicacies, served with a glass of sherry. A local newspaper columnist described the Tea Room as \"offering gentility ... a fireplace nearly as big as a wall and mullioned windows with sills that are nearly thick. The view is rolling lawns ...\"\n\nWhen the Tea Room was closed by the National Park Service on January 1, 1999, officials said they did so because of the potential fire hazard posed by operating a kitchen in the main park building and the possibility of insect or rodent damage to historic items in the mansion, as stated in the General Management Plan adopted by the NPS the previous year. While it \"may be a pleasant place to enjoy a meal ... that is clearly less important than the need to preserve Hampton's buildings, objects and landscapes for future generations,\" the Park Service stated. Officials of Preservation Maryland said they were \"disappointed\" by the restaurant's closure, saying it helped attract visitors to the historic site. The former chairwoman of the Hampton women's committee—which raises money for various projects at Hampton—also criticized the decision. Since 2006, the women's group has renewed efforts to have the Tea Room reopened, saying it would draw more visitors and repeat business from locals to the park. A Park Service spokesman was quoted as saying in October, 2006, that \"The mansion is not going to be the site of any food operation,\" but has made no further comment since then.\n\n"}

In Roman Catholic and other western Christian tradition, it is the first Sunday during the holy season of Lent. As on other Sundays of Lent, it is customary to dispense from the fast on Quadragesima, since Sundays are not counted among the forty days of Lent.\n\nThe term \"Quadragesima\" is derived from the Latin word for \"fortieth\", as there are exactly forty days from Quadragesima Sunday until Good Friday. However, like Quinquagesima, Sexagesima and Septuagesima, the numeral is more likely an approximation of how many days there are until Easter Sunday, in this case 42. While Quadragesima includes both Sundays and weekdays, the beginning of Lent was later changed to the preceding Wednesday, \"Ash Wednesday\", to get in forty weekdays.\n\nQuadragesima Sunday may occur as early as February 8 or as late as March 14.\n\nIn both the ordinary form of the Roman rite and common English parlance it is known as the First Sunday of Lent.\n\nThe \"buergbrennen\" festivities centred on a large bonfire are celebrated in the towns and villages of Luxembourg on the first Sunday of Lent to herald the coming of spring.\n"}

Presumably composed early in Bach's career, it is one of his most important and well-known works, and an important influence on 19th and 20th century passacaglias: Robert Schumann described the variations of the passacaglia as \"intertwined so ingeniously that one can never cease to be amazed.\"\n\nThe autograph manuscript of BWV 582 is currently considered lost; the work, as is typical for pieces by Bach and his contemporaries, is known only through a number of copies. There is some evidence that the original was notated in organ tablature. It is not known precisely when Bach composed the work, but the available sources point to the period between 1706 and 1713. It is possible that BWV 582 was composed in Arnstadt soon after Bach's return from Lübeck (where he may have studied Buxtehude's ostinato works).\n\nThe first half of the passacaglia's ostinato, which also serves as the fugue's main subject, was most probably taken from a short work by the French composer André Raison, \"Christe: Trio en passacaille\" from \"Messe du deuxieme ton\" of the \"Premier livre d'orgue\". It is possible that the second half of the ostinato was also taken from Raison, the bass line of \"Christe: Trio en chaconne\" of \"Messe du sixieme ton\" of the same publication is very similar. See \"Example 1\" for Bach's and Raison's themes.\n\nHowever, some scholars dispute Raison's influence. Bach's work shares some features with north German ostinato works, most notably Buxtehude's two chaconnes (BuxWV 159 and 160) and a passacaglia (BuxWV 161), and there is clear influence of Pachelbel's chaconnes in several variations and the overall structure.\n\nThe passacaglia is in time, which is typical of the form. Bach's ostinato comprises eight bars, which is unusual but not unheard of: an ostinato of the same length is used, for example, in Johann Krieger's organ passacaglia. The opening of the piece, which consists of the ostinato stated in the pedal with no accompaniment from the manuals, is slightly more unusual, although this idea also occurs elsewhere, and may even have been used by Buxtehude.\n\nThere are 20 variations in BWV 582/1. The first begins with a typical C minor \"affekt\", \"a painful longing\" according to Spitta, similar to the beginning of Buxtehude's \"Chaconne in C minor\", BuxWV 159. Numerous attempts have been made to figure out an overarching symmetrical structure of the work, but scholars have yet to agree on a single interpretation. Particularly important attempts were made by Christoph Wolff and . Some scholars have speculated that there is a symbolic component to the structure of the work: for instance, Martin Radulescu argues that BWV 582/1 is \"in the form of a cross\".\n\nThere is agreement among most scholars that the Passacaglia builds up until its climax in variation twelve. This is followed by three quiet variations, forming a short intermezzo, and then the remaining five variations end the work.\n\nBach performer and scholar Marie-Claire Alain suggested that the 21 variations are broken down into 7 groups of 3 similar variations, each opening with a quotation from a Lutheran chorale, treated similarly to the Orgel-Büchlein written at a similar time:\n\n\nAlain also points out that the numbers (21 repetitions of the Passacaglia ground and 12 statements of the fugue subjects) are inversions.\n\nThe passacaglia is followed, without break, by a double fugue. The first half of the passacaglia ostinato is used as the first subject; a transformed version of the second half is used as the second subject. Both are heard simultaneously in the beginning of the fugue. A countersubject enters immediately afterwards and is then used throughout the piece. When the three subjects appear simultaneously, they never do so in the same combination of voices twice; this therefore is a permutation fugue, possibly inspired by Johann Adam Reincken's works.\n\nAs the fugue progresses, Bach ventures into major keys (E and B) and the time between the statements increases from 1–3 bars to 7–13.\n\nThe passacaglia has been transcribed for orchestra by Leopold Stokowski, Ottorino Respighi, René Leibowitz, Eugene Ormandy, Sir Andrew Davis and Tomasz Golka and for piano by numerous composer/pianists including Eugen d'Albert, Georgy Catoire, Max Reger (in a version for 2 pianos), Fazil Say, Krystian Zimerman and Awadagin Pratt. It has also been arranged for a brass quintet by Neil Balm and performed by The Canadian Brass. A transcription for viol consort was recorded by the UK group Fretwork in 2005. In 2006, the passacaglia was transcribed for handbells by Kevin McChesney and recorded by Cast of Bronze from Dallas, Texas. The passacaglia was also transcribed by Donald Hunsberger for the Eastman Wind Ensemble (symphonic wind ensemble) and for the Eastman Trombone Choir (trombone octet). In 2009, the work was transcribed for string quartet by Nicholas Kitchen for performance by the Borromeo String Quartet.\n\nIn Stokowski's orchestral transcription the whole of the coda is slow and fortissimo without the possibility of a final massive rallentando. He made six commercial recordings of it between 1928 and 1972.\n\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\"Notes\"'\n"}

Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally publishes it through its Retroism brand in 2015.\n\nThe bumbling bachelor, Rex Nebular, has been hired by Colonel Stone to retrieve a vase that holds some sentimental value for 75,000 galactars. Rex agrees and sets out for the last known location of the vase.\n\nRex discovers that the planet where the vase was last known to reside has vanished, but his ship's sensors still detect a planetary mass and gravitational field, invisible to the naked eye. Suddenly a large warship decloaks behind him, and fires. His ship is badly damaged and is send crash landing on the strange planet, seemingly inhabited by women only.\n\nDecades ago, a vicious war between the sexes erupted on the planet. In the end, the females wiped out the male population with bio-weapons. As a result, the females were no longer able to give birth, so they had no way of continuing their species. They invented a machine that would allow them to alter their sex for short periods of time. This machine became known as the Cosmic Gender Bender (or the Gender Bender for short).\n\nThe populace of the planet is divided into two classes, Keepers and (breeding) Stock. The Keepers are technologically advanced and reside underground, where they monitor the Stock. The Stock reside above ground and have a primitive culture. Their only purpose is to be impregnated by a gender bent Keeper in order to repopulate the planet.\n\nThe game is divided into three difficulty levels. Higher difficulties have more puzzles and more death encounters. The left mouse button is used for selecting options and performing actions and the right mouse button is used to look at things (an alternative to selecting the 'look' option and selecting where). Some actions like sitting on a chair are automatically performed with just a left click. To get from one room to another the mouse pointer changes to a 'GO' icon where travel is possible. To get from one place to another, Rex will need to make use of teleporters correctly entering the code.\n\nThere are 10 different options, two of which are used to interact with people and seven of which are used to interact with objects.

It is one of many Samoan log drum variants and is of the slit drum family, and therefore is also of the idiophone percussion family. It is made from a hollowed-out log, usually of Miro wood and produces a distinctive and loud sound. Different sizes of log drums offer different pitches and volumes, as well as striking the log drum in the middle or near the ends.\n\nSamoa had large Indigenous log wood Talipalau drums a variant a little larger than a pate drum and somewhat smaller than the Lali log drum variant. The dimensions of some Talipalau are large as high and in length; these Talipalau are a distant cousin to the Fijian Lali drum which were larger in size. The smaller pate was said to be introduced to Samoa by inter-married Tahitians whom visited and settled in Samoa some 500 years ago. In recent times however the pate is used together with the other lesser known traditional log drum variants as well as the Samoan fala as percussive musical instruments. Because of the widespread distribution of Samoan music through the great Polynesian expansion, the use of the Pātē has gained much popularity among other neighbouring Polynesian Islands such as Uvea and Futuna, Tokelau, Tuvalu and Niue.\n\nThere are five main Samoan wooden slit drum variants:\n\n\nTahitian warriors introduced intricate wooden log pate drumming to the Samoan Islands and the Cook Islands. In Rarotonga its origins have grown into deep spiritual roots that are still found in Cook Islands drumming today.\n\nIn Samoa log drums have traditionally been used in communicating over large distances in times of war and for signalling times of Sa, Chief and Village Meetings. Drums are also used in traditional song and dance.\n\nIn Tahiti the people have taken a more contemporary approach where drumming and dancing is used more for entertainment and tourism than traditional functions. French Polynesia celebrates the annual Heiva i Tahiti festival where different tribes and island clan groups are able to contest against each other in dance and drumming competition the highest quality drumming in all of the South Pacific.\n\nFirst a segment of a hardwood tree trunk or thick branch is taken and stripped of its bark. Holes are then bored into the log in a straight line, from one end to the other, optionally leaving some space at each end. What remains in between the holes is then chiseled out, forming the characteristic slit. After this, the log continues to be hollowed out through the slit. Both the shape of the slit and the extent that the log is gutted will affect the tone and pitch of the pate.\n"}

England had lost 5–0 against the West Indies the previous year, then lost 2–0 and 1–0 to India and New Zealand respectively during the English summer. Australia, during the same period, had lost two series against New Zealand (2–1 and 1–0) and drew two series against India. While Australia had emerged with a drawn series from their tour of India, they had struggled against India at home the previous season and India had been unlucky not to have won the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.\n\nConsidering the losses that both teams had sustained, it was only natural that many felt this series was merely a battle for Test cricket's Wooden spoon. Australia had managed a tie in Madras and many commentators felt that Australia's batting had strengthened somewhat. The performances of Victorian batsmen Dean Jones and the new opening pair of David Boon and Geoff Marsh had been noted. Young NSW all-rounder, Stephen Waugh, was also beginning to make his presence felt, although certainly not to the level that many expected him. The bowling was still problematic, although Bruce Reid had begun to perform well.\n\nEngland began its tour at Brisbane in October 1986, losing the first game to Queensland by 5 wickets. Dirk Tazelaar, a tall, left arm bowler, took 4/34 in the first innings. England's batsmen were generally lacking form, though Ian Botham struck 86 off 67 balls, including eleven fours and four sixes – one six shattering a window at long-off. England's fielding was poor, with many catches dropped despite some effective bowling.\n\nA morale boosting 5-wicket victory against South Australia followed. Allan Lamb and tour debutant James Whitaker hit centuries while spinner John Emburey found form. It also marked the end of a depressing run of fourteen losses for the England team (including Test and tour matches). Parkinson, another left-arm fast bowler, took 5/87 in England's first innings. Experts began to question England's vulnerability against left-arm fast bowling.\n\nThe next match, in Perth, resulted in an embarrassing performance against Western Australia. Rain ensured the match ended in a draw, but England would have easily lost had the rain stayed away. Five catches were dropped in the first innings as Australian opener Geoff Marsh scored 124 in 345 minutes. Two left-arm quicks, Chris Matthews and Bruce Reid, took four wickets each as England collapsed for 152. Marsh then batted 246 minutes for his 63 in the second innings as Western Australia looked for a declaration. The match ended with England 6 for 153. David Gower, a very important member of the England lineup, had been dismissed for a \"duck\" in both innings. Captain Mike Gatting, vice captain Allan Lamb and backup opener Wilf Slack had also been dismissed for zero once each during the match.\n\nAustralia therefore approached the first Test as clear favourites. Martin Johnson of The Independent wrote that the English team \"had only three things wrong with them – can't bat, can't bowl, can't field\". Australia selected two left-arm fast bowlers – Bruce Reid and Chris Matthews (both from Western Australia) – to take advantage of the clear problem the English batsmen had with this sort of bowling.\n\nEngland's achievement in winning this match, especially against the backdrop of their early tour form, was remarkable. For Australia, with such high hopes against the \"old enemy\", the loss was depressing and indicated yet again that Australia's young side still had a long way to go before they could be competitive.\n\nEngland's first innings was dominated by Ian Botham's 138 off 174 balls. He was especially severe on Australian Bowler Merv Hughes, playing in only his second Test. Important also were the return to form of Gower (51) and Captain Gatting (61). A rain-shortened first day meant that Australia was 1–33 by the start of day 3. Australia's first innings was effectively ended by Kent seamer Graham Dilley, although all the bowlers were effective in either taking wickets or restricting runs. Geoff Marsh continued his good form from the previous tour match, scoring 56 in 205 minutes.\n\nUnfortunately for Australia, their first innings fell 8 runs short of avoiding the follow-on. Their second innings was dominated by Marsh's 110 off 392 minutes (by the end of this innings, Marsh had batted 1188 minutes – nearly 20 hours – in four innings against England). England's bowling was dominated by Emburey's 5/80, who conceded fewer than 2 runs per over. Australia was bowled out for 282 and England easily knocked off the runs required for a well-deserved victory.\n\nThe embarrassing failure of Australia in losing this match so completely also marked their 14th Test in succession without a victory. By any statistical analysis, Australia had reached their all-time historic \"low\" when the match ended. Having reached this point, the only way for Australia was up. Chris Broad became the third English batsman, after Jack Hobbs and Wally Hammond, to score hundreds in three consecutive Ashes Tests. Allan Border later criticised the Australian selectors for picking a team with only four specialist batsmen – Border says he wanted to pick Greg Ritchie but was overruled.\n\nThis match will always be remembered as \"Taylor's match\". When the team for the Test was announced, the Australian selectors had included the name of Peter Taylor from NSW. Thinking that a mistake in names had been made, the Australian media besieged the home of the talented young NSW opener \"Mark\" Taylor, thinking that he had been selected to play his first Test. Although history shows that Mark Taylor had a substantial Test career later on, the selectors had made no mistake in the name. NSW off-spinner Peter Taylor had impressed some selectors (especially Greg Chappell) with his all-round abilities during the previous season's Sheffield Shield final. He was noted as an off-spinner who really spun the ball and a number of the wickets he took during the test match were attributed to his 'loop' (the deceptive flight of a heavily spun cricket ball) and bounce from his unusual but high bowling action. Considering Peter Taylor's limited first-class experience, the selection was risky. Given the state of Australian cricket at this point, and the fact that the Ashes had already been lost, such a selection could be considered desperate. The selection was so shocking that the media quickly dubbed him \"Peter Who?\", and he became something of a celebrity leading up to the match. Spectators voiced their opinion too on the first day of the match. \"Aussie Selectors couldn't pick Bill Lawry's Nose\" declared one banner. No doubt these same spectators would have been cheering 5 days later as this unlikely player received the man of the match award.\n\nThe Australian first innings was dominated by Jones' 184 not out – his first century of the season and only his second Test century. Jones was lucky not to be out for 5, as video replays seemed to indicate that he had been caught behind. Australia managed 343 in the first innings, with Jones featuring in some very important late-wicket partnerships.\n\nGiven the dominance of England's batting throughout the season and the limited nature of Australia's bowling, both sides were stunned as England stuttered to 3/17 in their first innings, with Merv Hughes finally providing the venom he had been promising. Hughes, still inexperienced at this point, was one of the players the selectors stuck with despite his poor form. England recovered somewhat through the strokeplay of Gower and an almost embarrassing 69 from John Emburey (who kept falling over when playing the sweep shot). But it was debutant Peter Taylor taking 6/78 off 26 overs that ran through the middle order, including the dangerous Ian Botham.\n\nAustralia's second innings began badly again, then recovered slightly while Jones and Border were batting, then slumped again to 7/145. Steve Waugh (73) partnered Peter Taylor (42) in a 98 run partnership that, in the end, proved to be match-winning. Waugh, still potentially \"the next big thing\" and in front of his home crowd, was an attractive stroke-maker while Taylor, on the other hand, had little natural strokeplay but relied upon his concentration. John Emburey, the English Off Spinner, was taking every advantage of the wearing pitch with 7/78 off 46 overs.\n\nWith 320 to win on a wearing pitch, England applied themselves against the inexperienced Australian attack and aimed for victory. Gatting, out for 0 in the first innings, took England to 5/233, but was out caught and bowled to All-rounder Steve Waugh for 96. With the pitch getting worse, England put off thoughts of victory and worked to draw the match. John Emburey batted for over an hour for his 22, but was clean bowled in the penultimate over to a Peter Sleep leg-spinner that kept low. This gave Australia its first victory in 14 Tests. Peter Sleep finished with 5/72 – his only 5 wicket haul in Tests.\n\nThe Benson & Hedges Perth Challenge was a one-off one-day international tournament held at the WACA Ground, Perth in late December 1986 and early January 1987. It was part of the celebrations marking Australia's defence of the America's Cup yachting competition which was taking place simultaneously in nearby Fremantle.\n\nAustralia, England, Pakistan and the West Indies were the competitors. The games were played over a league basis and in coloured clothing, with Pakistan beating the West Indies in the first match under the new WACA floodlights. In England's victory over Australia, Ian Botham hit 26 runs off one over. England then inflicted a defeat over the then-dominant West Indies before beating Pakistan in a \"dress rehearsal\" of the final. Australia had a miserable tournament, losing all three games and being bowled out for a mere 91 in its game against the West Indies. Australian batsman Dean Jones did have a fine tournament, however, hitting back-to-back centuries. In the final, England comfortably beat Pakistan with 9.5 overs to spare.\nThe 1987 World Series Cup triangular tournament featured Australia, England and the West Indies, with games played at five venues:\n\nEach team played a total of eight games to reach the best of three final. Australia had a significantly better time than they had in the Perth Challenge, winning five of their eight qualifying games to top the group, ahead of England, with the West Indies eliminated. However, England rounded off their successful tour with a convincing 2–0 victory in the final series.\n\nDespite his promising debut, Australian off-spinner Peter Taylor never dominated a Test match in the same way again. Apart from a score of 54 not out against Pakistan a few years later and 87 against New Zealand in 1990, Taylor's overall Test record was mediocre.\n\nChris Broad also suffered from lack of consistency after this series. Despite his wonderful run of centuries, he never again dominated a bowling attack the way he did during this tour. He scored 116 against Pakistan in the infamous December 1987 Test, then 139 against Australia again in the Bicentenary Test match. However, Broad eventually finished with just 1661 Test runs at an average of 39.54. His final Test was during the 1989 Ashes series, where he scored 18 and 20 at Lord's.\n\nA number of other England players failed to live up to their potential from this series. Gladstone Small played only 17 Tests and took 55 wickets for an average of 34 runs. Young wicketkeeper Jack Richards found that the selectors preferred Bruce French when he returned to England. Richards retired before he turned 30, having played only 8 Tests. His 133 at Perth was his only Test century.\n\nPhilip DeFreitas, in his debut tour, eventually turned into an effective bowler for England, though he was never able to live up to the \"Black Botham\" tag that some had given him. Graham Dilley was another who served England well until his final Test in 1989.\n\nA number of Australians were able to learn from this series and were able to transform themselves into better players as a result. David Boon's Test career was written off after this series. Dean Jones lived up to his promise, while Steve Waugh, after a long period of time, finally began to deliver on his ability and was one of Australia's most important players in the 1990s. Australia's bowlers, notably Geoff Lawson, Merv Hughes and Craig McDermott, all returned to form and were integral parts of future teams that defeated England in 1989, 1990–91, 1993, and 1994–95. Bruce Reid's performances improved markedly, but back injuries limited his Test career.\n\nAfter this, England would not win an Ashes series for 18 years.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Delaware General Assembly, the founder of the Du Pont, Bauduy & Co., wool manufacturers, and brother of Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, the founder of the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company.\n\nVictor du Pont was born October 1, 1767 in Paris, France, son of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours and Nicole Charlotte Marie Louise le Dée. He married Gabrielle Joséphine de la Fite de Pelleport in 1794 and had five children, Amélie-Élisabeth (1796–1869), Samuel Francis (born and died 1799), Charles Irénée (1803–1865), Samuel Francis (1803–1865) and Julia Sophie (1806–1882).\n\nAfter 1784 du Pont worked with his father in King Louis XVI's Bureau of Commerce. There he had opportunities to travel around Europe and meet visiting friends of his father. In 1788 he began four years of work with the French minister to the United States in both New York City and Philadelphia. During this time, he wrote letters to his father analyzing the U.S. Constitution and the prospects for its ratification. Returning to Paris in 1793, he married and soon went back to the United States, this time as French Consul at Charleston, South Carolina. He remained there until 1797 when he was named French Consul-General at Philadelphia, but being refused recognition by President John Adams, he returned to France.\n\nFor the next two years Victor du Pont assisted his father in his preparation for the whole family immigrating to the United States. They finally sailed on the \"American Eagle\", arriving in Newport, Rhode Island, January 1, 1800. From there the father, two brothers, and wives and children, went to live at \"Goodstay,\" a house purchased for them in Bergen Point, New Jersey. Many ideas for future du Pont businesses were conceived in the coming year at \"Goodstay,\" including the one that had his brother, Eleuthère, beginning a gunpowder business. Victor and his brother returned to France for a year in 1801 to seek investors for that and various other prospects. He returned to New York, established a trading company, Victor du Pont de Nemours & Co., and acted as an agent for Louis Pichon, the French Consul-General and chargé d'affairs, provisioning French troops seeking to quell the rebellion then going on in Santo Domingo. This firm went into bankruptcy in 1808, as his many advances, including those to the French government, went unreimbursed. Victor next tried his hand at farming and merchandising on the Genesee River valley of western New York.\n\nIn 1811, he moved with his family to Delaware and established residence at \"Louviers\" on the Brandywine Creek, across from the Eleutherian Mills of his brother. He established a woolen mill to manufacture cotton cloth. Eleuthère's partner, Pierre Bauduy and son-law-law, Ferdinand Bauduy, joined the business in 1813, and it became known as Du Pont, Bauduy & Co. Soon after arriving in Delaware, Victor du Pont was elected to one of the New Castle County seats in the State House for the 1815, 1816, and 1817 sessions and later was elected to the State Senate for the 1821, 1822, and 1823 sessions.\n\nVictor du Pont died in Philadelphia on January 30, 1827, and is buried in the du Pont family cemetery near Greenville, Delaware. Victor du Pont was a man \"whose friends were everywhere.\" His son Charles took over management of the wool manufacturing business upon his death, and his other son, Samuel Francis, was a Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "2277871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277871", "title": "Metastability (electronics)", "text": "Metastability (electronics)\n\nMetastability in electronics is the ability of a digital electronics system to persist for an unbounded time in an unstable equilibrium or metastable state.\nIn digital logic circuits, a digital signal is required to be within certain voltage or current limits to represent a '0' or '1' logic level for correct circuit operation; if the signal is within a forbidden intermediate range it may cause faulty behavior in logic gates the signal is applied to. In metastable states, the circuit may be unable to settle into a stable '0' or '1' logic level within the time required for proper circuit operation. As a result, the circuit can act in unpredictable ways, and may lead to a system failure, sometimes referred to as a \"glitch\". Metastability is an instance of the paradox.\n\nMetastable states are inherent features of asynchronous digital systems, and of systems with more than one independent clock domain. In self-timed asynchronous systems, arbiters are designed to allow the system to proceed only after the metastability has resolved, so the metastability is a normal condition, not an error condition.\nIn synchronous systems with asynchronous inputs, synchronizers are designed to make the probability of a synchronization failure acceptably small. \nMetastable states are avoidable in fully synchronous systems when the input setup and hold time requirements on flip-flops are satisfied.\n\nA simple example of metastability can be found in an SR NOR latch, when Set and Reset inputs are true (R=1 and S=1) and then both transition to false (R=0 and S=0) at about the same time. Both outputs Q and are initially held at 0 by the simultaneous Set and Reset inputs. After both Set and Reset inputs change to false, the flip-flop will (eventually) end up in one of two stable states, one of Q and true and the other false. The final state will depend on which of R or S returns to zero first, chronologically, but if both transition at about the same time, the resulting metastability, with intermediate or oscillatory output levels, can take arbitrarily long to resolve to a stable state.\n\nIn electronics, an \"arbiter\" is a circuit designed to determine which of several signals arrive first. Arbiters are used in asynchronous circuits to order computational activities for shared resources to prevent concurrent incorrect operations. Arbiters are used on the inputs of fully synchronous systems, and also between clock domains, as synchronizers for input signals. Although they can minimize the occurrence of metastability to very low probabilities, all arbiters nevertheless have metastable states, which are unavoidable at the boundaries of regions of the input state space resulting in different outputs.\n\nSynchronous circuit design techniques make digital circuits that are resistant to the failure modes that can be caused by metastability. A clock domain is defined as a group of flip-flops with a common clock. Such architectures can form a circuit guaranteed free of metastability (below a certain maximum clock frequency, above which first metastability, then outright failure occur), assuming a low-skew common clock. However, even then, if the system has a dependence on any continuous inputs then these are likely to be vulnerable to metastable states.\n\nWhen synchronous design techniques are used, protection against metastable events causing systems failures need only be provided when transferring data between different clock domains or from an unclocked region into the synchronous system. This protection can often take the form of a series of delay flip-flops which delay the data stream long enough for metastability failures to occur at a negligible rate.\n\nAlthough metastability is well understood and architectural techniques to control it are known, it persists as a failure mode in equipment.\n\nSerious computer and digital hardware bugs caused by metastability have a fascinating social history. Many engineers have refused to believe that a bistable device can enter into a state that is neither \"true\" nor \"false\" and has a positive probability that it will remain indefinite for any given period of time, albeit with exponentially decreasing probability over time. However, metastability is an inevitable result of any attempt to map a continuous domain to a discrete one. At the boundaries in the continuous domain between regions which map to different discrete outputs, points arbitrarily close together in the continuous domain map to different outputs, making a decision as to which output to select a difficult and potentially lengthy process. If the inputs to an arbiter or flip-flop arrive almost simultaneously, the circuit most likely will traverse a point of metastability. Metastability remains poorly understood in some circles, and various engineers have proposed their own circuits said to solve or filter out the metastability; typically these circuits simply shift the occurrence of metastability from one place to another. Chips using multiple clock sources are often tested with tester clocks that have fixed phase relationships, not the independent clocks drifting past each other that will be experienced during operation. This usually explicitly prevents the metastable failure mode that will occur in the field from being seen or reported. Proper testing for metastability often employs clocks of slightly different frequencies and ensuring correct circuit operation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2277876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277876", "title": "1980 Tour de France", "text": "1980 Tour de France\n\nThe 1980 Tour de France was the 67th edition of the Tour de France. The total distance was over 22 stages. In the first half of the race, Bernard Hinault started out strong by winning the prologue and two stages. However, knee problems forced Hinault to abandon the race while still in the lead. Joop Zoetemelk became the new leader, and defended that position successfully. Just as in 1979 when Hinault and Zoetemelk finished nearly a half hour ahead of the rest of the field, the 1980 edition was a battle between these two riders until Hinault abandoned. At the time Hinault was just 21 seconds ahead of Zoetemelk and the race was about to enter the Pyrenees. Zoetemelk did not wear the yellow jersey during stage 13 though he did in every stage thereafter finishing the race with nearly a seven-minute advantage over second place Hennie Kuiper. It was his first Tour victory in his tenth attempt, after already having finished second in five editions.\n\nThe points classification was won by Rudy Pevenage, who also won the intermediate sprints classification. The mountains classification was won by Raymond Martin, and Johan van der Velde won the young rider classification.\n\nTwo weeks before the Tour would start, there were only twelve teams interested in starting the Tour. The teams with Italian and Spanish sponsors were focussed on the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España, and thought their cyclists were not able to compete in two grand tours in one year. This prevented Giovanni Battaglin of the Spanish-based , the winner of the mountains classification of 1979, from defending his title. Francesco Moser, who had left the 1980 Giro d'Italia injured, was the only Italian cyclist on the initial starting list, but he was not able to start, so the 1980 Tour was without Italian cyclists. One more team was added to the starting list, so the Tour 1980 started with thirteen teams, each with ten cyclists. The Boston–Mavic-Amis du Tour team was a combination of the Belgian Boston-Mavic team and French cyclists without a contract, combined into the \"Amis du Tour\" team.\n\nThe teams entering the race were:\n\nThe three most important favourites for the victory were Bernard Hinault, Joop Zoetemelk and Hennie Kuiper. Hinault was the winner of the two last editions, and had earlier that year won the 1980 Giro d'Italia. Zoetemelk, the runner-up of the last two editions, had switched teams to the TI–Raleigh team, which was considered one of the strongest teams. Kuiper had left the TI-Raleigh team and moved to the Peugeot team. The manager of that team, Maurice De Muer, had already managed Bernard Thévenet to a Tour win, and this made Kuiper confident.\n\nThe 1980 Tour de France started on 26 June, and had two rest days, in Saint Malo and Morzine. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 17.\n\nBefore the race, Hinault expressed dissatisfaction with the cobbled sections in stages five and six. In the 1979 Tour, Hinault had lost time in these sections, and he considered to organise a strike. Even though no strike was held, the route was still changed: after the fifth stage, tour organiser Félix Lévitan decided to change the first of the stage, to avoid the worst cobbled sections.\n\nThe 25 stages were won by riders from only four countries. In this year's edition of the Tour, the last rider in the General Classification after the consecutives mountain stages (16-19) was eliminated.\n\nThe prologue was won by Hinault, who finished :05 ahead of Gerrie Knetemann and 0:23 ahead of the closest General Classification rider Hennie Kuiper. Stage 1A was a sprint finish won by Jan Raas and Stage 1B was the first Team Time Trial in which TI-Raleigh claimed the victory ahead of Renault and Peugeot gaining enough in the time bonus for Knetemann to become the new leader. In Stage 2 Rudy Pevenage, Yvon Bertin and Pierre Bazzo escaped in a breakaway and were able to stay away the entire stage winning by nearly ten minutes over the rest of the field. Pevenage claimed the stage victory with Bazzo taking second and while Bertin took third he was the highest placed of the three and took over the lead in the general classification.\n\nStage 3 was won by Henk Lubberding and Bertin ended up falling off the back losing considerable time, which made Pevenage the new overall leader going into the second individual time trial (ITT) in Stage 4. Bernard Hinault was aiming to win his third straight Tour de France and in the ITT he looked to be well on his way dominating the rest of the field. Of the 122 riders remaining in the main field only six of them were able to come within 2:00 of Hinault and nobody was able to finish within a minute of the defending champ. Joop Zoetemelk was the closest to him taking second place at 1:16 back and in the overall situation overall Pevenage remained leader by about a minute over Bazzo with Hinault closing the gap to within six minutes.\n\nStage 5 was run in terrible weather, but the aggressive Hinault was looking to distance himself from the competition and went on the offensive together with Kuiper. Hinault won the stage, with Kuiper finishing right on his wheel, gaining more than two minutes on all of the other of the General Classification Riders although following this stage many riders began experiencing tendinitis problems, including Hinault. \nGoing into Stage 6 Hinault was within four minutes of Pevenage in the general classification and built a lead of more than 3:00 on Kuiper, nearly 4:00 on Zoetemelk and more than 5:00 on Raymond Martin and Joaquim Agostinho. The stage was won by Jean-Louis Gauthier by a full second over the rest of the field with no major changes in the overall classification.\n\nStage 7A would prove to be the beginning of a remarkable run by the TI–Raleigh team, who won the team time trial (TTT) beginning a stretch where a rider from this team would win seven stages in a row. During this TTT Hinault's knee problems were showing, as he could not do his part of the workload, although his Renault team still managed a respectable 4th place behind Raleigh, Peugeot and Ijsboerke.\n‘Panzer Group Post’ as they were known because of their Directeur Sportif Peter Post, attacked relentlessly in an effort to win stages and contain any attacks made by Hinault to put Zoetemelk in a position where he could defeat Hinault in the upcoming high mountain stages. The plan was working as Stage 7B was won by Jan Raas, Stage 8 by Bert Oosterbosch, Raas would win again in Stage 9 and Stage 10 was won by Cees Priem. After stage 10 Pevenage was still in Yellow by 2:44 over Bazzo with a 4:20 advantage over Hinault, however The Badger was in the lead among the serious contenders although his lead over Zoetemelk had been cut to 2:00 with Kuiper 2:24 behind Hinault.\nStage 11 was a time trial prior to going into the high mountains of the Pyrenees and if Hinault wanted to match the likes of Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx by winning his third Tour de France in a row he would have to perform well. The day however, belonged to Zoetemelk as he took the Stage victory with only eight riders finishing within 2:00 of him. Finishing 0:46 behind was Hennie Kuiper with Agostinho coming in 3rd, Oosterbosch finishing 4th and Hinault in 5th 1:39 back. Hinault was back in the yellow jersey but his lead over Zoetemelk was a minuscule 0:21. Rudy Pevenage fell to 3rd place and Kuiper was 1:31 back with no other general classification (GC) contenders within 5:00. Normally, Hinault was the better time trialist, so Zoetemelk's stage victory made him confident that he had the chance to win the Tour.\n\nIn Stage 12 Gerrie Knetemann and Ludo Peeters escaped and managed to beat the Peloton by more than a minute with Knetemann beating Peeters at the finish line. Late that evening, with the first stage of the high mountains looming, Hinault decided to withdraw. Zoetemelk, until that moment second in the general classification, became the new leader, but refused to don the yellow jersey during the following stage following the example of Eddy Merckx who refused to wear it in the 1971 Tour de France after Luis Ocaña left the race as leader. In Stage 13, Zoetemelk rode in his notoriously conservative style, allowing Raymond Martin to escape, as he was a distant threat in the general classification, but he kept Kuiper close, who was now his main rival for the overall victory. Zoetemelk would not stray from who he was as a rider and maintained this defensive tactic for the rest of the race. Martin won the stage breaking the impressive streak of TI-Raleigh and climbing into 3rd place in the process. Not only this but during this stage he distinguished himself as the strongest rider on a very talented Miko-Mercier team, who also had Christian Seznec and Sven-Åke Nilsson as GC contenders and for the previous several years also had Zoetemelk, who remained the overall leader, with Kuiper in 2nd place at 1:10 behind him. In Stage 14 Ludo Peeters escaped again, this time finishing alone more than a minute ahead of the Peloton for the stage win and in Stage 15 Bernard Vallet gutted out an impressive win finishing just four seconds ahead of Jean-Raymond Toso and the 1975 Tour de France and 1977 Tour de France winner Bernard Thevenet who was nearing the end of his remarkable career.\n\nGoing into Stage 16 Zoetemelk was now 1:18 ahead of Kuiper and 5:03 ahead of his former teammate Martin. In the 16th stage, one of Zoetemelk's present teammates Johan van der Velde, who had been riding a very good Tour, nearly fell off his bike and cut off Zoetemelk with van der Velde's back tire hitting Zoetemelk's front causing him to viciously crash into the pavement. Zoetemelk quickly remounted and continued the race but was bleeding from his arm and thigh. Jos De Schoenmaecker won the stage with the group of favourites coming in over a minute later as Zoetemelk was not only able to get back to the elite group, but he also put another 0:16 into Kuiper .\n\nThe fall in the 16th stage did affect Zoetemelk's performance in stage 17, as Zoetemelk had to let others go on the first climb. Helped by the Panzer Group, he was able to stay close to his competitors and was in good position for the final climb. Mariano Martinez survived his breakaway attempt and won the stage as Zoetemelk was able to drop 2nd place Kuiper, who came partially unhinged losing almost 1:30. 3rd place Raymond Martin was able to leave Zoetemelk behind but it was near the end of the stage and by this point it was too little too late as he was only able to take 0:15 back. In Stage 18 Ludo Loos escaped and crossed all five cols first, finishing more than five minutes ahead of the Peloton in a remarkable solo stage win which turned out to be the only Tour stage victory of his career. Zoetemelk finished in the second group with Robert Alban and Lucien Van Impe nearly a minute ahead of Martin and 2:30 ahead of Kuiper who fell to 3rd place as Martin moved into 2nd. With the Alps now finished the last obstacle in the way of Zoetemelk winning his first Tour de France was the time trial in Stage 20.\n\nStage 19 was an Intermediate stage in which Sean Kelly and Ismael Lejaretta beat the Peloton to the line by 0:20 and Kelly earned his second career stage win by winning the sprint. The overall situation remained the same going into the time trial which was won in dominating fashion by Joop Zoetemelk with only one rider coming within a minute of him and that rider was his own teammate Gerrie Knetemann. With Kuiper and Joaquim Agostinho finishing in 3rd and 4th at plus 1:12 and 1:13 respectively, Zoetemelk was now virtually assured of the overall victory with his lead now built to about 7:00 over Kuiper, who moved back into 2nd having a considerably better ride than Martin.\n\nStage 21 was a flat stage which was once again won by Sean Kelly and while Kelly rode an impressive Tour competing for the points classification, he ended up finishing second in that classification to Rudy Pevenage. Between 1982 and 1989 Kelly would go on to win the points classification four times. On the final stage into Paris the blossoming star was in good position for the final sprint to go for another stage win but he was beat to the line by Pol Verschuere who won the first Tour stage of his career that afternoon on the Champs Elysees. Zoetemelk crossed in the middle of the pack side by side with teammate Gerrie Knetemann who hoisted Zoetemelk's arm into the air while crossing the finish line.\n\nShortly before the start of the Tour, it was announced that Dietrich Thurau had tested positive in his national championship. He was allowed to start the Tour while his B-sample was being tested. His B-sample gave a negative result, so he could continue the Tour.\n\nOn the day of the final time trial, when it was all but clear that Zoetemelk would be the winner, tour director Jacques Goddet wrote in the newspaper l'Équipe that the only thing that could keep Zoetemelk away from a Tour victory was the drug tests for anabolic products after the eighteenth stage. As the director, Goddet was well-informed about drug tests, and many journalists speculated that his comments meant that Zoetemelk's A-sample had returned positive. Zoetemelk had tested positive in 1977, and was not happy about the insinuations. Tour co-director Félix Lévitan apologised for Goddet's choice of words.\n\nAt the end of the Tour, it was announced that all doping tests had returned negative.\n\nThere were several classifications in the 1980 Tour de France, four of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. In the 1979 Tour de France, Gerhard Schönbacher and Philippe Tesnière had both been trying to finish last, which had received attention from the press. The Tour organisation wanted to the press to focus on the winners, so they added the rule that after the 14th to 20th stage, the last-ranked cyclist in the general classification would be removed.\n\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\n\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\n\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only cyclists younger than 24 were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey.\n\nThe fifth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only points were awarded on intermediate sprints. In 1980, this classification had no associated jersey.\n\nA combination classification was also calculated; this was done by adding the points for the points classification, mountains classification, intermediate sprints classification and combativity award. A new competition was introduced in 1980, sponsored by the French television station TF1, therefore named \"Grand Prix TF1\". It was calculated from the results in the other classifications, and therefore seen as a successor of the combination classification that was calculated from 1968 to 1974. There was no jersey associated with the Grand Prix TF1. The Belgian Ludo Peeters won this classification.\n\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps.\n\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Christian Levavasseur won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 17. This prize was won by Johan De Muynck.\n\nAfter it was said that Zoetemelk only won because Hinault abandoned, Zoetemelk replied \"Surely winning the Tour is a question of health and robustness? If Hinault does not have that health and robustness and I have, that makes me a valid winner.\" Hinault agreed to that, saying that it was the absent rider (Hinault) who is at fault, not the one who replaces him.\n\nIn the individual time trial prior to the start of the mountain stages Zoetemelk dominated Hinault to come within 21 seconds of the overall lead. While Hinault was rarely beaten in any individual time trial, it was common knowledge that Zoetemelk was probably the best mountain climber in the world and with the mountain stages about to begin it is unlikely Hinault's lead of 21 seconds would have held.\n\nHinault's knee problems were solved before the 1980 UCI Road World Championships, which he won.\n\n"}

{"id": "2277892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277892", "title": "Alpha Rho Chi", "text": "Alpha Rho Chi\n\nAlpha Rho Chi (ΑΡΧ) is a professional co-educational college fraternity for students studying architecture and related professions. The fraternity's name is derived from the first three letters of the Greek word for architecture, ἀρχιτεκτονική.\n\nAPX was founded on April 11, 1914, with the joining of Sigma Upsilon at the University of Michigan and the Arcus Society at the University of Illinois to form a national fraternity for Architecture and the allied arts.\n\nSigma Upsilon was founded four years prior by eight architecture students at Michigan, with the intent of eventually forming a national architecture fraternity, and had drafted their constitution and laws to reflect that. Two years after they were founded in 1912 they were recognized by their school as a fraternity and started negotiation with other schools to open up more chapters.\n\nIn 1911 the Arcus Society was formed by 15 architecture students, at first secret and then becoming public a year later. After their recognition by their school, they started correspondence with several other schools in an effort to expand as well. One of those schools was the University of Michigan, which was the start of the collaboration of the two founding brothers of APX, Leo M. Bauer of the Arcus Society and Chandler C. Cohagen of Sigma Upsilon.\n\nAccording to fraternity history books, the University of Illinois chapter claims to be the first chapter of the new fraternity, by an attempt to set the meeting during a time in which Illinois was off on break, and Michigan's chapter would still be in classes, leading to the Anthemios chapter being the first chapter of the fraternity. Iktinos (Michigan) instead claims the first chapter out of pure virtue of their precursor organization existing before the one at Illinois. Both the Iktinos and Anthemios chapters are considered the founding chapters, and as such, share the same cadency mark.\n\nThe two founding brothers met on April 11, 1914, at the Hotel Sherman in Chicago, where they selected the new name of the combined organization, the new constitution and by-laws, and the coat of arms. The brothers decided to keep the colors of the Arcus Society, azure and sanguine, and the white rose, a symbol of Sigma Upsilon to represent both organizations. They also selected the names of the new chapters from a list of prominent Greek, Roman (and later on Egyptian) architects. Illinois selected Anthemios as their name and Michigan, Iktinos.\n\nAlpha Rho Chi set expansion as their first goal, wanting to embody their vision of being a national architecture fraternity. Several existing architecture organizations petitioned to join, but the only Tau Epsilon Chi of Ohio State University was accepted, being installed as the Demetrios Chapter on February 25, 1916. The Cyma Club became the Mnesicles Chapter at the University of Minnesota on October 10, 1916. Recruiting efforts remained active, but with the start of World War I, most of the brothers entered the armed services and the number of chapters stayed at four.\n\nAfter the war, the Kallikrates Chapter was installed at the University of Virginia on February 15, 1922. The Andronicus Chapter was installed a month later, on March 11, 1922, with eleven charter members at the University of Southern California. Expansion continued at a rapid pace with the addition of members at Kansas State, which formed the Paeonios Chapter on February 10, 1923. Ten members of the Delta Club at the University of Texas were initiated on April 19, 1924, to form the Dinocrates Chapter. The Polyklitos Chapter at Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie-Mellon University) was established on May 24, 1924. With the addition of the Theron Chapter at Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State University) on May 23, 1926, the fraternity stood at ten active chapters and was truly national in stature.\n\nThe Depression and World War II affected the strength of the local chapters, and several failed to survive. Only six chapters returned – Anthemios, Iktinos, Demetrios, Mnesicles, Andronicus, and Kallikrates – with strong alumni support and renewed membership. In 1954, the Vitruvius colony was established at Pennsylvania State University, and it was installed as a chapter on March 27, 1955.\n\nNext to be installed was a very active group from Arizona State University, who became the Satyros Chapter on May 13, 1962. Two surprised representatives from Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) were initiated at the 31st National Convention; in turn they assisted with the installation of the Metagenes Chapter on March 23, 1969. With the addition of the Xenocles Chapter at the University of Texas at Arlington on September 13, 1970, Alpha Rho Chi returned to its former high point of ten active chapters.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, fraternity membership in general dropped again as controversy raged on college campuses over the Vietnam War and any \"establishment\" organization. Alpha Rho Chi continued on, installing the Cleisthenes Chapter at the University of Houston on March 11, 1972. The beginning of the 1980s saw college fraternities enjoy a renaissance and Alpha Rho Chi added four new chapters. In June 1980, the vigorous Daedalus Chapter was founded at the California Polytechnic State University to become the fraternity's second West Coast chapter. After a freezing initiation night at the Anthemios chapter house, the Daphnis Chapter of the University of Arkansas was installed on November 23, 1980. The Heracleides Chapter of the University of Oklahoma was installed with a down-home, Texas-style bar-b-que at Xenocles on September 6, 1981. After collecting the required ten members for initiation, the Rhoecus chapter was installed at the University of Kansas on April 8, 1984.\n\nThe Apollodorus colony was bussed from the University of Florida to Metagenes, a 13-hour trip. They were officially installed as a chapter in Gainesville, Florida, on April 10, 1986. On March 29, 1992, Alpha Rho Chi installed the Pytheos Chapter at the University of Nebraska. The Seshait Chapter at Florida A&M University was installed on March 12, 1994, becoming the first chapter with an Egyptian namesake.\n\nThe co-op program at the University of Cincinnati created a unique installation for the Rabirius Chapter, whose members were initiated in two separate ceremonies; one held in Cincinnati on November 4, 2000, and the remainder of the members were initiated on January 20, 2001. In September 2001, a professor began correspondence with the fraternity in hopes of establishing a chapter of Alpha Rho Chi for the students at the University of Memphis. Up to this point, Alpha Rho Chi had limited expansion to accredited schools of architecture; however, after revisiting the fraternity's original objectives and mission, it was determined that there was no reason to exclude the University of Memphis, and on October 19, 2002, the Imhotep Chapter was installed in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nImproved communications, including the alpharhochi.org website and nearly universal email access, helped interested students of architecture discover and contact the national fraternity, accelerating the pace of expansion of new and reactivated chapters. Nicon Chapter was established at Florida International University on July 11, 2004. In the Northeast, the Vitruvius Chapter sponsored two new chapters simultaneously. Vitruvius installed the Domitian Chapter from the New Jersey Institute of Technology on January 30, 2005, and the Senenmut Chapter from the University at Buffalo on February 26, 2005—the chapter's fiftieth anniversary. A colony at Tulane University was preparing its petition to establish a chapter when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, closing the school for a semester and scattering the students across the country and to other continents.\nAfter regrouping, the Hadrian Chapter was finally installed on November 4, 2006.\nAfter rocky beginnings, students at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco successfully formed the Cossutius Colony, and were installed at the Andronicus chapter house on January 20, 2008. Representatives from Andronicus, Daedalus, Satyros, Anthemios, Hadrian, and Vitruvius chapters were on hand to usher in the newest chapter.\n\nThe Anthemios chapter house is currently on the National Register of Historic Places at the University of Illinois. A centennial celebration is planned at the Anthemios chapter house beginning in 2014 sponsored by the Anthemios Alumni Association. The Andronicus chapter house is on the list of Historic Cultural Monuments by the City of Los Angeles, and is awaiting placement on the Federal Register of Historic Structures. The Anthemios house has 18 bedrooms, most which used to be double occupancy. Currently, only rooms 5–7, 16 and 17 are capable of double occupancy. Keeping up with the progressive era, the Anthemios house changed to coed bathrooms in the late 2000s due to the influx of female brothers. In 2014, the Olynthius chapter at the University of Maryland was founded and they successfully inaugurated their Theta class on November 18, 2018. The Theta class was provided with information on the history and traditions of the fraternity by brothers Liam Berson and Eleanor Cromwell.\nIn the spring of 2017, Alpha Rho Chi welcomed two new chapters into their fold; the Theodorus chapter was established at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in February and was followed closely by the Amenophis chapter at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale in April. As of 2019, there were two colonies in formation with Syracuse University establishing the Skopas colony and The Ohio State University seeking to revive the dormant Demetrios chapter as a colony.\n\nThe Alpha Rho Chi Bronze Medal is awarded annually at accredited schools of architecture in the United States and Canada to honor graduating seniors who have demonstrated leadership, service, and the promise of professional merit. The recipients of the medal are decided by the faculty of each school. Membership in the fraternity is not a criterion for the award, nor is membership conferred to the medal's recipients. The medal program was established in 1931. Designed by sculptor Robert Merrell Gage, the medal is cast in bronze and features an image of a seated Athena holding a skyscraper.\n\nOn occasion, Alpha Rho Chi recognizes other individuals with two other classes of medals. The fraternity awards the Alpha Rho Chi Silver Medal for fraternal service. The Gold Alpha Rho Chi Medal honors an outstanding practitioner of architecture or an allied art. Recent recipients of the gold medal include I.M. Pei and Samuel Balen.\n\n\"Master Architect\" is a special classification of membership in the fraternity to honor brothers who have gained national prominence in the field of architecture, the allied arts, or who have made significant contributions to the built environment.\n\nThe following individuals have been installed as Master Architect (with year honored):\n\nPei is the only Master Architect of Alpha Rho Chi not to be a member of the fraternity.\n\nChapters take their names from architects of ancient Egypt, Greece, or Rome.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2277898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277898", "title": "Jetan", "text": "Jetan\n\nJetan, also known as Martian Chess, is a chess variant first published in 1922. It was created by Edgar Rice Burroughs as a game played on Barsoom, his fictional version of Mars. The game was introduced in \"The Chessmen of Mars\", the fifth book in the Barsoom series. Its rules are described in Chapter 2 and in the Appendix of the book, with an actual game partly described in Chapter 17.\n\nJetan is played on a black and orange checkered board of 10 ranks by 10 files, with orange pieces on the \"north\" side and black pieces on the \"south\".\nEach player has the following playing pieces: one \"Chief\", one \"Princess\", two \"Fliers\"; two \"Dwars\" (Captains); two \"Padwars\" (Lieutenants); two \"Warriors\"; two \"Thoats\" (Mounted Warriors); and eight \"Panthans\" (Mercenaries). The Chief, Princess, Fliers, Dwars, Padwars and Warriors are positioned along the rank closest to the player with the Chief at left center, the Princess at right center, and the Fliers, Dwars, Padwars and Warriors arranged to flank each, with the Fliers innermost and the Warriors outermost. The Thoats and Panthans are positioned along the next rank out from the player with the Thoats flanking the Panthans. The complete arrangement of each side follows:\n\nThere has in the past been considerable confusion regarding the rules of Jetan, but research has shown that most such problems can be cleared up through careful analysis of the text in \"The Chessmen of Mars\". This article is based primarily on the Appendix in \"The Chessmen of Mars\", but takes the abovementioned research into consideration.\nJetan pieces move one, two or three steps for every move. Two- and three-steppers may change their direction of movement at each step in the course of a move, so long as this is in a direction permitted for that piece. No piece can cross the same square of the board twice during the course of a move. The Princess and the Flier may jump over a piece that is in their path.\n\nA capture is made when a piece lands on a square occupied by an opposing piece with its final step or jump; the Princess may not capture.\n\nThe pieces move as follows:\n\nBy analogy to standard chess, it is assumed that a piece that moves multiple squares can capture an opposing piece only by \"finishing\" its move on the opposing piece's square. In other words, a piece can capture only once per turn. Burroughs was explaining his chess rules for an Earth audience familiar with standard chess. He deliberately stated that the Princess and the Flier may jump over a piece that is in their path. The only reasonable interpretation is that the Chief, Dwar, Padwar, and Warrior are \"blocked\" by pieces in their path (as are the queen, rook, and bishop in standard chess). It is unreasonable to suppose that Burroughs could have meant that the Flier jumps over intervening pieces while the Chief captures all intervening pieces, as this would be so different from standard chess that he would have stated this, had it been his intention.\n\nIt is not explicitly stated in Burroughs' text that a piece entitled to a two-space or three-space move \"must\" move the full amount, but implicit information suggests that this is the case. For example, the Padwar at [P] is entitled to a two-space diagonal move, so in the diagram below, it must end its move on the spaces marked [2]; if all the spaces marked [1] are occupied by friendly or opposing pieces, or if all the spaces marked [2] are occupied by friendly pieces, then the Padwar is blocked and unable to move.\n\nIn Burroughs's description, Jetan is won when either a Chief captures the opposing Chief, or when any piece captures the opposing Princess. The game is drawn if each player is reduced to three or fewer pieces of equal value and it is not won within the next ten moves, or if a Chief is taken by any piece other than a Chief.\n\nSome consider these rules to result in too many draws so a number of variants have been proposed to address this issue, the simplest being that the capture of a Chief by a piece other than a Chief merely retires the Chief without drawing or ending the game.\n\nAccording to \"The Chessmen of Mars\", Jetan was said to represent an ancient war between the Yellow and Black races of Barsoom. This explains why the orange pieces begin on the \"north\" side and black pieces on the \"south,\" because Barsoom's Yellow and Black races inhabit its north and south polar regions, respectively.\n\nThe second half of \"The Chessmen of Mars\" takes place in the city of Manator, where the most popular civil event involves human beings fighting to the death in a life-sized Jetan game viewed by hundreds of spectators. The \"board\" is large enough that some of the pieces are mounted on Thoats and yet still fit in a single \"square.\" However, this life-and-death version departs from the rules of Jetan in one very significant way: when one piece lands on a square occupied by another, the first does not automatically replace the second. Rather, the two pieces fight to the death, and the winner of the sword fight wins the square. The lone exception involves the Princess: if one side's piece lands on a square occupied by the other side's Princess, no battle occurs, and the first side wins the game.\n\nIn his Appendix, Edgar Rice Burroughs writes: \"The Martians gamble at Jetan in several ways. Of course the outcome of the game indicates to whom the main stake belongs; but they also put a price upon the head of each piece, according to its value, and for each piece that a player loses he pays its value to his opponent.\" But Burroughs never specified any exact rules for gambling, nor did he give the point values for the various pieces.\n\nAlthough gambling is optional per Burroughs' rules, some fans have developed several rule variants for gambling, with names such as \"Ransom\" and \"Pay to move\", which have sometimes been used when playing the game.\n\nMany suggestions have been made for the respective values of the pieces. The list below is based on Cazaux & Knowlton.\n\n\nJetan has been adapted to the computer medium on several occasions. Some variants of Jetan on the computer are:\n\nBurroughs inspired many other writers of the sword and planet genre. Some such writers have also included chess-like games in their writing, often with a living version. Instances of such possible homage include:\n\n"}

It corresponds to the northern section of the natural Miladhunmadulu Atoll, located in the north of the Maldives.\n\nOn 26 October 2009, the government decided to move the capital of Shaviyani Atoll from Funadhoo to Milandhoo, citing more ease for the people. However, this decision was overruled by parliament in June 2010, and Funadhoo was reinstated as the capital of the atoll, much to the dismay of both the government and the people of Milandhoo. This decision was vetoed by President Nasheed, and Milandhoo continued as the seat of the atoll office. The issue surfaced once again on February 26, 2011 when home rule was introduced into the country and the atoll offices were to be rebranded as the secretariats for the newly formed atoll councils. According to the Decentralization Bill, under which the councils were formed, the respective secretariats were to be seated in the capital islands of each atoll as stipulated in the new constitution of 2008, which in Shaviyani Atoll's case is Funadhoo. In the first atoll council meeting, it was decided to move the secretariat from Milandhoo to Funadhoo, as per the law states. The government responded with threats to dissolve the council if the move is followed through, and appealed the order of the Funadhoo Magistrate Court to carry out the move. On March 1, after the Milandhoo Magistrate Court ordered the work of the secretariat to return to Milandhoo, an order backed by the President, riot police was deployed to Funadhoo to \"urge the council to respect the court order\" issued by Milandhoo. The following day, the Supreme Court of the Maldives ruled that the Milandhoo court order was invalid and that the Funadhoo court order was, a ruling which the government and Milandhoo did not accept. On April 6, the parliament overrode the initial presidential veto on the capital island legislature, and declared Funadhoo as the legitimate capital island. In 2012, all of the materials used in Milandhoo were transferred to Funadhoo.\n\nIt is notable that as of 2013, the official website of the President's Office does not display an address for the Shaviyani Atoll Council.\n\nThis administrative atoll is 37 miles long, it is the third atoll from the northern edge of the country, and It comprises 51 islands of which 16 are inhabited. The islands in this atoll are small with half of the islands having less than 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of land area. There are 9 islands that are smaller than one hectare (2.49 acres). These islands comprise 18% of the islands. The smallness of the atoll indicates to the islands' vulnerability to environmental impacts.\n\nThe population of the atoll is 12,091 as of the 2014 census.\n\nFishing and agriculture form the mainstay of the atoll's economy. Fishing is engaged in throughout the year, with pole, line and reef fishing practised in various islands in the atoll. The atoll is also known for craftsmanship, such as mat and rope weaving.\n\nSeveral inhabitants work in the tourism industry and other commercial trades in the Maldivian capital, Malé.\n\nThe atoll is assigned the Maldivian letter 'Shaviyani' and the Latin letter 'C' as the atoll code. The atoll Council is responsible for public services, development and economic affairs. The Shaviyani Atoll Office was established on 9 September 1958 by the state. Until 1 January 1968, the atoll office was located in Lhaimagu which was the capital of the atoll. The government declared that effective from 1 January 1968, the capital would be Farukolhu Funadhoo (Funadhoo) and hence, the atoll office was transferred to Funadhoo.\n\nBasic medical care was introduced in the atoll with the establishment of a health centre on 25 December 1970 in the island of Lhaimagu. This health centre was shifted to Farukolhu Funadhoo (now Funadhoo) in 1971 when the island was made the atoll capital. This health centre is now developed to Atoll Hospital which has a well equipped laboratory and operation theater facilities and are manned by a gynecologist, anesthetist and a general practitioner. Other than Atoll Hospital, there are 13 Health Centre in the atoll with Doctor and Nurses.\n\nMajority of the population of the atoll have access to safe drinking water. Around 99% of the households have been provided with water storage tanks on tsunami recovery program. Most households have safe sanitation facilities.\n\nPrimary education is universal in all inhabited islands of Shaviyani Atoll. All the schools in the atoll providing education to Grade 10. And the Atoll Education Centre, Atoll School provide education to Grade 12. Most of the secondary schools yet offer only commerce stream subjects. The schools which offer both the Science and Commerce stream subjects are the Shaviyani Atoll Education Centre in Komandoo, Atoll School in Kanditheemu, Funadhoo School and Milandhoo School. Some of the School introduce TVET programs to the students. Most schools have computer labs funded jointly by parents, government and the Shaviyani Atoll Development Project.\n\n"}

He also organized a community self-help program in predominantly black East Pasco and landed a seat on the Pasco City Council. In 1968, Fletcher ran for Lieutenant Governor of Washington State and narrowly lost to the incumbent, John Cherberg. Fletcher was the first African American in Washington as well as the West to contest a statewide electoral office. During the campaign, his driver and bodyguard was Ted Bundy, the serial killer who was active in Republican Party politics in the late 1960s through the early 1970s.\n\nFletcher's close race for Lieutenant Governor got the attention of newly elected President Richard Nixon, who gave Fletcher a job in the incoming administration as Assistant Secretary of Labor.

Total population of Noonu Atoll is around 10,000 people (Information from: 2006).\n\nThe Administrative Divisions of the Maldives refers to the various units of government that provide local government services in the Maldives. According to the Decentralization Act 2010, the administrative divisions of the Maldives would consist of atolls, islands, and cities; each administered by their own local council, under the basic terms of home rule.\n\nAlthough the earlier provincial decentralization was rejected by Parliament, President Nasheed reinstated the concept through \"National Administrations\". The National Administrations of Maldives were in the same divisions as the earlier provinces, and the previous province offices were reinstated as the office of that National Administration, to which the atoll councils reported to accordingly. The National Administrations acted as an extension of the central government in Male’, for the convenience of dealing with regional affairs. The National Administrations operated under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The seven National Administrations were:-\n\nUpper North National Administration\nNorth National Administration\nNorth Central National Administration\nCentral National Administration\nSouth Central National Administration\nUpper South National Administration\nSouth National Administration\n\nNorth Province was one of the seven short-lived provinces of the Maldives. The provinces were created in a decentralization attempt by the Nasheed administration in 2008. As of 2009, it was governed by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Ms. Thilmeeza Hussain.[needs update] Rejecting this change, the Parliament saw the abolition of the province system in 2010, through a newly enacted Decentralization Act. It consisted of Baa, Lhaviyani, Noonu and Raa Atolls. Its capital was Felivaru. Its population (2006 census) was 43,539.\n\nBefore Decentralization Act was approved by the Parliament of Maldives, President Mohamed Nasheed appointed Atoll Councilors and Island Councilors to apply the concept of Decentralization to the Administrations of the Councils. \n\nAs the first Noonu Atoll Councilor Mr. Mohamed Mahid Moosa Fulhu was appointed at the date of 18th August 2009 and remained till 25th December 2010 until the Decentralization Bill was approved by the Parliament of Maldives.\n\nWhen the Local Government Decentralization Act was established Atoll Councilors and Island Councilors were elected by the vote of the people who belongs to the constituency. Local Council election was elected on 11 February 2011 and Mr. Mohamed Mahid Moosa Fulhu remained the constituency seat for Manadhoo Constituency from February 2011 till February 2014. Mohamed Mahid Moosa Fulhu was elected by the Atoll Council Members as the Vice President of Noonu Atoll Council.\n\nThe whole district consists of 71 islands. 13 of these island are inhabited: Fodhdhoo, Hebadhoo, Holhudhoo, Kedhikolhudhoo, Kudafari, Landhoo, Lhohi, Maafaru, Maalhendhoo, Magoodhoo, Miladhoo and Velidhoo.\n\nThe channel to the west of Noonu Atoll is called Baraveli Kandu. \"Baraveli\" means hermit crab in local Dhivehi language.\n\nHaa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc. are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives. They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).\"\n\nNoonu Atoll has the highest density of swarming fishes which can be found in the Maldives, especially Fusiliers and Snappers. It also has a huge spinner dolphin population. The underwater world is also famous for scuba diving. The best known spots are Orimas Thila, a shark point for grey and white tip reef sharks, as well as Christmastree Rock (Vavathi Kurohli Thila) which is famous for the abundant soft coral life.\n\nNoonu Atoll is home to 6 luxury resorts: NOKU Maldives (Kudafunafaru), Soneva Jani (Medhufaru), Cheval Blanc (Randheli), The Sun Siyam (Irufushi), Robinson Club Noonu (Orivaru) and Velaa Private Island (Orimasvaru).\n\n"}

{"id": "2277940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277940", "title": "Rawtenstall", "text": "Rawtenstall\n\nRawtenstall () is a town at the centre of the Rossendale Valley in Lancashire, England, with a population of 22,000. It is the seat for the borough of Rossendale, in which it is located. The town lies 17.4 miles north of Manchester, 22 miles east of Preston and 45 miles south east of the county town of Lancaster. Nearby towns include Bacup, Haslingden and Ramsbottom.\n\nThe name Rawtenstall has been given two possible interpretations. The older is a combination of the Middle English \"routen\" ('to roar or bellow'), from the Old Norse \"rauta\" and the Old English stall 'pool in a river' (Ekwall 1922, 92). The second, more recent one, relates to Rawtenstall's identification as a cattle farm in 1324 and combines the Old English \"ruh\" 'rough' and \"tun-stall\" 'the site of a farm' (Mills 1991, 269), or possibly, 'buildings occupied when cattle were pastured on high ground' (Mills 1976, 125).\n\nThe earliest settlement at Rawtenstall was probably in the early Middle Ages, during the time when it formed part of the Rossendale Valley in the Honour of Clitheroe, and consisted of simple dwellings for forest servants and animals. More substantial buildings may have followed in the 15th and 16th centuries with corn and flour mills.\n\nThe town entered a major period of growth during the Industrial Revolution, as new mills were constructed to process cotton. The climate and weather were conducive to the industry, as was the town's nearby location to the rapidly developing industrial and mercantile centre at Manchester, dubbed 'Cottonopolis'. Only a few of these mills survive today, and none are still operational. During this period, the brothers Thomas, David and Peter Whitehead became important entrepreneurs in the town. They built a number of mills, including one of the earliest mills in the valley, at Lower Mill, and the still existing Ilex Mill. They also built substantial houses for themselves at Holly Mount, as well as large numbers of terraced houses for their workers. Other industries active in this period included quarrying and small scale coal mining, as well as an expanding commercial sector.\n\nAs with many small mid-Lancashire towns, it saw a population decline in the 20th century, going from 30,000 inhabitants in the 1911 census to 21,500 in the 1971 census. With the decline of the traditional manufacturing industries, shoemaking became one of the last survivors. this was usually known locally as the slipper industry, since slipper-making grew from the local processing of felt, which itself grew from the textile industry. The firm of H. W. Tricketts, in nearby Waterfoot, had been a major producer and exporter of footwear across the British Empire, but shoemaking declined rapidly from the 1980s. Firms closed as production moved overseas, and the remaining companies are largely importers.\n\nThe church of St Nicholas (Church of England) is at Newchurch (rebuilt 1825) as is the Roman Catholic church of St Peter (1892). Other churches are St Michael's Lumb, St James's Waterfoot, St Anne's Edgeside, St John's Cloughfold, St Mary's Oakenhead, St John the Evangelist's Crawshawbooth, St Mary and All Saints Goodshaw (rebuilt 1790). Another RC church (dedicated to St James the Less) is at Oakenhead and there are a number of Nonconformist chapels.\n\nA local board was formed for the town in 1874 and the district it governed was extended to cover parts of the townships of Lower Booths (Rawtenstall itself), Higher Booths, Newchurch and Haslingden in the ancient parish of Whalley and Cowpe, Lench, Newhall Hey and Hall Carr, and part of Tottington (Higher End) in the ancient parish of Bury. Subsequently, Rawtenstall was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1891 and in 1894 a civil parish was created to match the borders of the borough. Following the local government reorganisation in 1974 Rawtenstall became part of the Borough of Rossendale.\n\nRawtenstall is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, after the constituency of Rossendale was abolished in 1983. The constituency sends one member of parliament to the House of Commons.\n\nJake Berry MP has been the Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen since 2010.\n\nIts neighbouring communities in the valley are Bacup, Haslingden and Ramsbottom. The area is bounded to the north by Loveclough and Whitewell Bottom, to the east by Waterfoot and Cowpe and to the south by Townsend Fold and Horncliffe. The River Irwell passes through the town on the first part of its route between Bacup and Manchester, collecting Limy Water close to the junction of Bury Road with Bocholt Way. Over recent years the area has become increasingly popular with visitors, attracted by historic buildings, dramatic landscapes and fine walking country.\n\nLike most of the United Kingdom, Rawtenstall has an oceanic climate.\n\nThe town has had bus routes since the early 1930s. The district is currently served locally by Rosso, with a large bus station in the town centre, as well as frequent express services X43 to Burnley, Nelson and Manchester run by Burnley Bus Company. In 2007 a proposal to demolish part of the previous bus station and build a Lidl store on the site was agreed and the new store was finally completed in 2009. Lancashire County Council and Rossendale Borough Council then eventually replaced the old bus station with a modern bus interchange, which commenced service on Sunday 24 November 2019.\n\nRawtenstall railway station also serves the town, but since the closure of the main line to Manchester, it now operates mainly as a tourist route, as part of the East Lancashire Railway, of which Rawtenstall station forms the northern terminus. The M66 motorway from Manchester is linked to Rawtenstall via the A56 Edenfield bypass, allowing for a driving time between Manchester and Rawtenstall of around half an hour. Today, Rawtenstall's nearest rail station is in Acrrington and over the border in Yorkshire, Todmorden. The nearest metro link is Bury Interchange.\n\nThe town has a number of primary and secondary (high) schools, including Bellmont School, St Paul's C of E Primary, Cloughfold Primary School, Leabrook School, Alder Grange Community and Technology School and All Saints' Catholic High School. Though located in Waterfoot, rather than Rawtenstall, the traditional grammar school, Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School takes part of its name from the town.\n\nRawtenstall also has a public library, built in 1906 with Carnegie funding.\n\nBy 2000, Rawtenstall's 1960s shopping centre had become deserted and boarded-up, and after 2003 various proposals were put forward regarding reconstruction or refurbishment. An agreement between Rossendale Council and the owners of the Rawtenstall centre, Ashcap, in February 2011, was said to \"improve Rawtenstall town centre\". In late 2011 the shopping centre was demolished, creating a new town square area, where local markets and other events are infrequently held. Rossendale Council funded the demolition using money set aside for a public pool in neighbouring town Haslingden. This move was controversial locally, but the completed bus station has also attracted positive comment. Since 2017 several new bars, shops, bistros and venues have opened in the centre of the town, along with a rejuvenated market under new management.\n\nClose by to the Cricket Ground is the Weavers Cottage. This is a characterful 18th century loom shop, which has been restored as a small museum containing a Victorian kitchen, a clog shop and a working hand loom.\n\nThe Rossendale Valley's local newspaper, the \"Rossendale Free Press\" was originally based in Rawtenstall, before being bought out by the Manchester Evening News in 2009 and subsequently moving to Manchester. Rawtenstall also has one of the largest indoor markets in Rossendale (a sign declaring it to be \"probably the friendliest market in the world\"), which suffered a serious arson attack in March 2011.\n\nThe town is also home to the traditional herbalist and temperance bar Fitzpatrick's Herbal Health, which claims to be the oldest brewer of sarsaparilla and dandelion and burdock in the country. Fitzpatrick's gained television acclaim in April 2005 when it won the Famous Sarsaparilla Taste-off on ITV. It is the last bar of its kind in England.\n\nThe acclaimed fashion boutique Sunday Best was opened in 1971 by Jan Shutt and is situated on Bank Street. Sunday Best won \"The Daily Telegraph\" magazine's best shop in Britain award for women's fashion in 2011 whilst Roland's Florist on Bacup Road was runner up in the best florist category. The awards were judged by TV shopping guru Mary Portas.\n\nPolice facilities in Rawtenstall were one of five sites used for the training of new recruits to the Lancashire Constabulary. In late 2011, due to funding cuts, Rawtenstall Police Station, along with various other stations in the area, closed down. Rawtenstall is also the location of the area's county and magistrates' courts.\n\nRawtenstall was featured in the documentary series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" which was aired on BBC2 at 9.00pm on 2 February 2006. The subject, actress Jane Horrocks, was born in Rawtenstall in 1964.\n\nThe Irwell Sculpture Trail also runs through the town, where four of the sculptures are located; the Whispering Wall, the Gateway, the Willow Tree and the Bocholt Tree. The last, by sculptor Bernard Tindall, celebrates Rossendale's twinning links with the town of Bocholt, Germany. The \"Shoe Trail\" also hits the outskirts of the town, and goes through nearby places such as Whitaker Park.\n\nWhitaker Park is located on the outskirts of the town centre, between Haslingden Road (A681) and Haslingden Old Road. It consists of the former house of the mill owner George Hardman, built in the 1840s, set in extensive landscaped grounds. Donated to the township of Rawtenstall in 1902 by Richard Whitaker, who brought the house from Hardman for the purposes of civic recreation, the property is now known as The Whitaker, previously Rossendale Museum and Art Gallery. The gardens and surrounding land are laid out as a public park. The park itself has tennis courts, a bowling green, basketball court, an Incredible Edible area, a skateboard area and a playground as well as formal gardens and fountains.\n\nThe museum contains exhibits of local history, including information about the house as it was originally, and a good collection of domestic bygones. There is an extensive exhibition of taxidermy, whilst gallery areas are used to display contemporary art. Arthur Mee considers it 'one of the best small museums in the North'. In 2019 The Whitaker was awarded a National Lottery Heritage Fund award of £1.7 million to convert the former barn and stables. This will double its size, and enable the museum to develop its displays, its cafe and bar, and the education spaces. As a result, it will close for much of 2020 for the work to be completed.\n\nRawtenstall is home to the North of England's largest dry ski-slope. \"Ski Rossendale\" is located five minutes from Rawtenstall town centre in the Oakenhead area, directly above Whitaker Park and Rossendale Museum. Over its 40-year existence it had seen world record attempts and was used by Olympic athletes and novice skiers. It re-opened after a period of closure in November 2011 with new funding, with a large ceremonial fireworks display on its opening day, Bonfire Night.\n\nRawtenstall Cricket Club, who compete in the Lancashire League, have their home ground, Worswick Memorial Ground, within the town. Rawtenstall is also home to Rossendale RUFC, who compete in the North Premier.\n\n\n"}

In an April 2012 interview, Khin Nyunt, formerly the country's prime minister, claimed that he personally intervened to save Aung San Suu Kyi's life during the massacre, by mobilising his men to bring her to a safe location at a nearby army cantonment.\n\nIn making this statement, the Asian Legal Resource Centre concurs with the preliminary findings of the Ad Hoc Commission on the Depayin Massacre, presented on 25 June 2003. In its summary observations on the attack, the Ad Hoc Commission observed that the attack was clearly premeditated and well organised, as indicated by the following:\n\n\nThe Asian Legal Resource Centre is of the opinion that the massacre at Depayin clearly amounts to a \"widespread or systematic attack directed against [a] civilian population, with a knowledge of the attack\" (article 7.1 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court) and is therefore a crime against humanity. To date, however, there has been no serious action taken on the massacre.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2277954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2277954", "title": "Palmengarten", "text": "Palmengarten\n\nThe Palmengarten is one of three botanical gardens in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It is located in the Westend-Süd district. It covers a surface of 22 hectares. It is major tourist attraction.\nLike many public sites in Frankfurt, it was privately financed and implemented by the architect . Work was completed in 1871 and opened to the public. One colorful visit was from the American entertainer Buffalo Bill who brought his Western show in 1890. In 1931, it was taken over by the city of Frankfurt but was later transferred to the American occupation authorities after World War II. When the Palmengarten was returned to the city's hands in the sixties, a major reconstruction effort was begun. Halls destroyed in the war were redeveloped and expanded. In 1992 the reconstruction finished completely and the Palmengarten shined in its new form.\n\nDirectly next to the area of the Palmengarten is the Frankfurt Botanical Garden, which formerly belonged to the biology department of Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt and is now administered by the Palmengarten.\n\nThe botanical exhibits are organized according to their origin in free-air or climatized greenhouses, which also contain numerous tropical and subtropical plants.\nAt the entry to the garden half of the original social building of 1905, which was rebuilt again, currently serves as the main entrance to the Palmengarten. To the right and left of the entrance we find exhibition rooms and teaching rooms. On the first floor in the south wing are some carnivorous plants, in the north wing are some American pineapple plants, which are grown indoors. The visitor is \"in situ\", information points on the ecology and geography of everything on display.\n\nOnce the entrance building is left behind, we find the «Rosaleda», with a characteristic geometric style of plant distribution. A pergola gives the formal touch of rose garden, with its paths and its flower beds carefully cared for. The \" Rosenbrunn \" house is located in the middle, built in the early garden style of 1884, it had been part of the office buildings. Themed gardens (for example: with scent roses or the so-called \"classic roses\") delimit the rose garden to the north and south.\n\nThis is the main core of the original Palmengarten, it was built in 1869 and is one of the largest buildings of its kind found in Europe. Along with a large number of subtropical palm trees, and covering the lower part of the forest canopy are tree ferns, plants with long and tender stems, and broad-leaved plants, which together produce an image of great subtropical exuberance. There is also a stream that cascades down from the high back of the hill-shaped structure. In a grotto-like passageway under the hill, it is shown in aquariums, a colorful tropical underwater world.\n\nIn the western part of the gardens and bordering the lake that is located here, the \" Rhododendrongarten \" ('Garden of rhododendrons') was created in 1989. Here a large variety of hybrids of species from eastern Asia and North America were planted side by side. These plants need a soil rich in humus and very acid for their development. This area is a spectacle of color in late May and early June when they bloom.\n\n\nIt is located at the highest point of the garden, a rocky hill with an imposing waterfall, from here you get one of the best views. The rockery (\"Der Steingarten\", or \"Garden among the stones\"), is located on the flanks of the rocky hill, and it was completely renovated in the 80s. With acidic soils and Alkaline in small gaps between the rocks are these plants from all the mountainous regions of the planet.\n\nWhere the rockery ends, in the east, the heather garden begins with its attractive color in the blooms of late summer. Also appealing is the gradation of shades of green presented by the rest of the year, this collection of wild and crossed species of the genera Erica and Calluna.\n\nIt is located in the northern part of the garden. This part of the garden has puddled areas, with abundant water and a stream accompanies along the main path of the walk. Here the plants grow grouped in bushes along the stream. Plants are found as green herbs, where the brushstrokes of color are provided by Asteraceae.\n\nAn enclave worth visiting in the garden is the \"Flower House\". The house has about 200 m² and is divided into hot and cold zones. Here the visitor can find flowering plants at any time of the year. Here the plants are periodically renewed.\n\nThis is the house \" Leonhardsbrunn \" flanked on both sides by striking greenhouse towers, it was rebuilt according to old plans. Here the plants are shown with the provenance and the expedition in which they were collected. In the western tower we find citrus, the eastern tower is dedicated to plants from the island of Tasmania. Plants in the southern half of the Earth sphere are grown in the central structure.\n\nIn the western part of the \" Tropicarium \" in a flat and drier area than in other parts of the garden, there is a collection of plants that develop in full sun. They are plants from the steppe estuary regions of Eurasia and the America s. In the middle of the garden is a glade. Here you will find a selection of forage grasses and among them meadow flowers develop, just as they can be found in any meadow in a field that has been left uncultivated.\n\nThese facilities were inaugurated in 1992, bringing together plants from the cold regions of the southern half of the globe. The characteristics of the vegetation are forest, shrub, and swamp areas. The red sandstone dominates on the left, where the plants of the Patagonia, Archipelago Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands are located, being delimited by a small swampy area. On the right side with a firm gray, are plants from New Zealand and neighboring islands.\nThe plants of the \" Tropicarium \" are not shown according to their continents or countries, but are grouped according to their biotope. What is attempted is to show the variety and richness of the tropical zone. The greenhouse \"Tropicarium Sur\" is a small structure that contains plants from semi-arid zones, savanna, and foggy desert.\n\nThis area deserves a special mention. Shown during the warm months from May through September, it is a collection of succulent plants that withstand harsh winters. They come from America, Africa and from the Canary Islands. In between these plants a large variety of fuchsias are displayed at the same time.\n\n"}

In 1995 Reg Grundy sold the company to Pearson Television, which has since become known as FremantleMedia and is part of the RTL Group (in turn 90% owned by Bertelsmann). In 2006 FremantleMedia merged Grundy Television and Crackerjack Productions to form Fremantle Australia. Until 2013 the Grundy name still existed in Germany as Grundy Light Entertainment and in Italy as Grundy Productions Italy.\n\nAfter success in radio, Reg Grundy's first TV production was \"Wheel of Fortune\" which launched on Nine Network in 1959. Another show with this title, although based on a Merv Griffin production, celebrated its 25th anniversary in Australia, a week before its cancellation in July 2006.\n\nIn the late 1980s Reg Grundy established Grundy World Wide Limited.

There are differences in flavor depending on the geography of where the sauce is made: in Europe it is generally slightly sour-tasting, while in North America it is typically more heavily sweetened.\n\nCranberry sauce was first offered to consumers in North America in 1912 in Hanson, Massachusetts. Canned cranberry sauce appeared on the market in 1941, allowing the product to be sold year-round. Cranberry sauce can be used with a variety of meats, including turkey, pork, chicken, and ham.\n\nThe most basic cranberry sauce consists of cranberries boiled in sugar water until the berries pop and the mixture thickens. Some recipes include other ingredients such as slivered almonds, orange juice, zest, ginger, maple syrup, port, or cinnamon.\n\nCommercial cranberry sauce may be loose and uncondensed, or condensed or jellied and sweetened with various ingredients. The jellied form may be slipped out of a can onto a dish, and served sliced or intact for slicing at the table.\n\nCranberry sauce is often eaten in conjunction with turkey for Christmas in the United Kingdom and Canada or Thanksgiving in the United States and Canada, and it is only rarely eaten or served in other contexts there.\n\n\n"}

The total measures approximately 38 km wide (east-west) for 46 km long (north-south), covering a surface of 1 127 km surface.\n\nThe atoll is formed by 105 coral reefs, representing a reef surface of 263 km. These reef surface in 61 islands provided with vegetation, and a variable number of sandy cays (between 4 and 14). Half (38) of these islands are less than 10 hectares, constituting less than 20% of the atoll lands.\n\nThe biggest island is Dharavandhoo (45,5 ha), followed by Kunfunadhoo (35 ha). The highest point, difficult to establish, can be situated in Funadhoo., with 3,19 m over the sea level.\n\nMaalhosmadulu Atoll is also considered as a good example of the rich biodiversity found in the Maldives, including large mangroves and a unique diversity of fauna, such as the benthic fauna. Furthermore, the ring-shaped reef forms known as \"faru\" in the Dhivehi language is a reef structure which is unique to the Maldives.\n\nThe southernmost uninhabited island of Olhugiri in the North Maalhosmadulu Atoll lies 13 km north of Goifulhafehendhu Atoll. Olhugiri is well known for its unique natural vegetation and for providing two of the only perching sites for the great frigatebird in the Maldives. Likewise, other marine creatures such as seaturtles and hawksbill turtles can be encountered.\n\nThe Fisheries Ministry of the Maldives has banned catching turtles or taking eggs from Olhugiri, which also applies to 11 other islands.\n\nOne of the most important species living around Baa Atoll is the parrot fish.

In addition to its 12,170 inhabitants, some 350,000 tourists visit the biosphere reserve annually. As part of a Global Environment Facility (GEF) project, the site has great potential for demonstrating sustainable development throughout the Maldives and the region, while relying on a green economy.\n\nHanifaru Bay which is known locally as Vandhumaafaru Adi is thought to be one of the few places in the world where whale sharks congregate in to mate although recent research suggests otherwise with the vast majority of the whale sharks seen there being young males.

A book of the same name, containing the transcripts of a wider selection of McGregor's dreams, and with illustrations by Edward Gorey, was also published in 1964.\n\nMcGregor would essentially narrate his dreams at conversational volume. As a narrator of his (often terrifying) dreams, Dion adopted various personas but frequently established a fey, argumentative, insolent approach to the subject at hand – be it a hot air balloon trip to the moon with a group of multi-ethnic children, a frantic journey around New York, or a tattooing job on a woman's tongue.\n\nAs a songwriter, McGregor's biggest success came when his song \"Where Is The Wonder\" (cowritten with roommate Michael Barr) was recorded by Barbra Streisand on her hit album \"My Name Is Barbra\" (1965). He was unable to find much success afterwards, however, and by the 1980s had given up on songwriting. Critic Joslyn Layne writes that \"Despite his lack of success as a song lyricist, McGregor's narration of his vivid dreamlife provided a more unique artistic contribution than any usually recorded.\"\n\nMcGregor died in 1994, but researcher Phil Milstein gathered recordings of McGregor's dream-speech considered too risque to be released in the 1960s and assembled them for the 1999 album, \"Dion McGregor Dreams Again\", released on Tzadik Records.

Although it is not legally binding under U.S. law, the ESRB rating system is a de facto standard which is self-enforced by the U.S. video game and retail industries. In some Canadian provinces, ESRB ratings are enforceable by law by local film classification boards.\n\nGames with the AO rating are considered by the board to be suitable for players age 18 and over; AO-rated games can contain higher levels of violent, profane, sexual, or pornographic content than the next-lowest rating on the scale (Mature [M], generally considered suitable for players 17 and over) can accommodate. AO is the highest of the ESRB's content ratings, and restricts the commercial availability of games which carry it; all three major video game console manufacturers (Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony) refuse to allow AO-rated games to be published for their platforms, most retailers refuse to stock AO-rated games, and the popular video game live streaming service Twitch explicitly bans all games carrying the rating. The only mainstream platform to allow AO-rated games is Steam, which hides them by default. Due to these self-imposed restrictions on the marketing and distribution of games with the rating, the AO rating has been described as a \"kiss of death\" by critics. \nRelatively few games carry the AO-rating; the majority of AO-rated games are adult video games which received the rating for containing sexual and/or pornographic content, but the ESRB has also issued the rating for games containing extreme violence. The fighting game \"Thrill Kill\" (1998) was given an AO rating for its violent content; its release was cancelled after the acquisition of its publisher, Virgin Interactive, by Electronic Arts, as they objected to the game's content. Rockstar Games' \"Manhunt 2\" (2007) was the second game given an AO rating for extremely violent content and the first to be released, but was re-edited to meet the M rating so it could be released on consoles (an uncut, AO-rated version for Windows was released in 2009). \"Hatred\" (2015), a game centering on a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, was the third game to receive the rating solely for violence and the second to be released. The only game to receive the rating for reasons unrelated to violence or sexual content is \"Peak Entertainment Casinos\" (2003), which received the rating as it allows the player to gamble using real money.\n\nFellow Rockstar game \"\" (2004) was temporarily re-rated to AO from M in response to the release of a mod known as \"Hot Coffee\", which allowed players to access a sexually-explicit minigame that was removed in development, but still present within the game's code in an incomplete state.

It is one of the prime residential areas in Chennai and is home to several prominent doctors, lawyers and politicians. Real estate prices are among the highest in the city . A recent addition to the area is VR Chennai Mall, located near Shanthi Colony and Thirumangalam junction.\n\nAnna Nagar is the first and the only township in Chennai to follow a standard addressing system followed in the western world. One of the primary landmarks in Anna Nagar is the Anna Nagar Tower, built in 1968 as part of the World Trade Fair. Other important locations include the Anna Arch, Chinthamani, Blue Star, 14 shops, Shanthi Colony, Thirumangalam junction, Padi grade separator, Anna Nagar East, and the Anna Nagar West bus depot.\n\nAnna Nagar has several established schools and colleges, places of worship, shopping areas with both independent shops and chain stores, and numerous restaurants.

It was called Mullam Village and is still referred to like that by the Land and revenue department for all official purposes. \n\nAnna Nagar was developed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board in the early 1970s following the World Trade Fair in the area in 1968. The board developed residential plots, apartments, commercial complexes, wide roads, school zones, bus termini, and large parks.\n\nAs of 2018, Anna Nagar zone had a green cover of more than 20 percent, as against the city's 14.9 percent average.\n\nAnna Nagar is a secular neighbourhood with several places of worship co-existing in harmony.

N. Annadurai, when Anna Nagar was still a developing area. It was inaugurated by the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran on 1 January 1986. Each arch stands 52 ft tall and weighs 82 tonnes. The road from the arch leads to the roundtana (roundabout) which is a major landmark and for all practical purposes, the centre of Anna Nagar.\n\nIn 2012, the arch was proposed to be demolished to leave way for a flyover that was planned to connect Anna Nagar with Aminjikarai. Demolition work began on 2 September 2012. However, the alignment of the flyover was modified slightly to prevent the removal of the arch, and the arch was restored at a cost of 6.4 million.\n\nThe Anna Nagar Tower is a tall tower built for the 1968 World Trade Fair, by B. S. Abdur Rahman. Its main entrance is from the 3rd Main Road and a back entrance from the 6th main road. It is popular with morning walkers and joggers, and with families and young people in the evenings to play and relax. For a nominal fee, one could walk to the top of the tower from where excellent views of the city could be seen. Entry inside the tower has been stopped for the last few years due to safety concerns as there had been a few cases of suicide in the past. The tower and park are now renovated and has a skating rink. Currently, it boasts of a good turnout of children who come in for practising their skills on roller skates.

In addition, a standardized naming nomenclature is adopted. In Anna Nagar, 2nd, 4th and 6th Avenues run East-West and 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th Avenues run North South. All the streets are interconnected to these avenues. Areas expanded after the formation of the initial 1970 layouts do not follow the standard nomenclature.\n\nThe Anna Nagar Roundtana located at the intersection of 2nd Avenue and 3rd Avenue is a sprawling and burgeoning high-scale commercial neighborhood.

It has a wide variety of markets and showrooms in the vicinity such as Croma, Tanishq, Bata, etc. and thus is a very important landmark for shoppers.\n\nThe Anna Nagar railway station was inaugurated in the year 2003. It is located on the Thirumangalam road, a road that connects Anna Nagar West with Villivakkam. The railway line stretches for 3.09 kilometers and links Anna Nagar with the Tiruvallur-Chennai suburban line. Between 2003 and 2007, five suburban trains were operated from Anna Nagar to Chennai Beach via Villivakkam. The station was closed in 2007 for the construction of the Padi elevated rotary.

Madame Fatal was created and originally illustrated by artist/writer Art Pinajian and the debut of the character was in the \"Crack Comics\" #1 (May 1940), a crime/detective anthology series published by Quality Comics. Madame Fatal continued as a feature in that title but when the character was not well received, Madame Fatal made a last appearance in #22 (March 1942).\n\nThe character later appeared in some publications by DC Comics when DC Comics bought the rights to the character in 1956, along with a bulk buy of all Quality Comic's characters, although Madame Fatal not been seen much since except a few brief appearances and passing mentions by other comic book characters.\n\nMadame Fatal is notable for being a male superhero who dressed up as an elderly woman and as such is the first cross-dressing hero. The original incarnation of the Red Tornado would become the first cross-dressing heroine later that year.\n\n\"She\" was actually Richard Stanton, a handsome, pipe-smoking, dapper, middle-aged blonde Caucasian man who is exceptionally intelligent and intuitive, as well as being at the peak of his physical abilities. He had made a vast fortune successfully playing the Wall Street stock market of the late 1920s, a time of economic unrest, which incurred the jealousy of many of those close to him. In his private life, Stanton was also a widower and a single father, being the parent of a two-year-old (unnamed) girl. As well as being a successful financial investor, Stanton is also a lover of theatrics and a world-famous stage, theatre, radio and film actor living in Manhattan, until his wealthy and prominent celebrity status brought unwanted attention from costumed villains. Stanton's daughter was kidnapped by them and the police were unable to uncover their identities, but Stanton was, on his wits and superior investigative skills. As such, Stanton decided to take matters into his own hands after he deduced that the leader of the gang was John Carver, a crime kingpin who had been running extortion rackets in various cities.\n\nAs a civilian, Stanton had already been searching for Carver for eight years, after a fight they had and the threats that Carver had made. Prior to this, Carver had been the first man to love Stanton's late wife, and Carver had been jilted when she chose Stanton instead. After the kidnapping of Stanton's daughter, and when the police got nowhere, Stanton's wife was riddled with guilt as it was her previous connection with Carver which had brought about the whole scenario. She died of a broken heart.\n\nStanton was able to infiltrate the John Carver gang due to his convincing acting and stage disguise as an old, helpless, red-cloaked woman with a yellow walking cane which doubled as a sly quarterstaff. Once inside their lair Stanton then used his natural athleticism and physical abilities to wipe out the unsuspecting gang, and revealed his true identity to Carver. In the ensuing fight, Carver (a formidable fighter himself) knocked Stanton to the ground and attempted to shoot him with a revolver, but Stanton quickly pulled out a rug from underneath Carver, tripping him up, and Carver accidentally shot himself instead. In his dying breaths, the crime kingpin told Stanton his daughter was still alive, although held captive by another villain. He never revealed who before dying.\n\nStanton decided to retire from acting and continue down the path of a crime-fighter and bring other villains to justice, inspired by his first success, adopting the alter-ego Madame Fatal. Stanton made his last appearance on Broadway on May 1, 1930, as an old woman, which garnered Stanton praise and acclaim from the audience. After that he disappeared from public view altogether and became \"Madame Fatal\" full-time. Stanton would also use the alternate identity to attempt to locate his captive daughter, whom Carver had passed on to other villains. When the character rights were sold to DC Comics and DC decided not to continue the character, this plot point was not resolved contemporaneously, and it was not revealed which villain was actually holding Stanton's daughter until \"The Shade\" #4 in 2012.\n\nThe old woman disguise was aided strongly by his expert acting skills, being a former professional actor and female impersonator. This same disguise also often raised Stanton above suspicion, and made him an expert in confidence trickery, infiltration, stealth, information gathering, and melting anonymously into crowds. Madame Fatal was also aided on occasion by his pet parrot, Hamlet, his only connection to his previous life. Hamlet was named so because he was intelligent enough to recite Shakespeare, and would inspire and help Stanton remember important information.\n\nAlthough Stanton had no actual super powers to speak of, he was a strong, agile and athletic man at his physical peak and a skilled fighter with a powerful punch. He had a high level of intelligence and intuition which aided his investigative abilities and locating criminals. Madame Fatal often came up against criminal masterminds and supervillains such as Doctor Prowl (a black-masked, hat-wearing gentlemanly murderer with metal claws) and the Jester (a violent clown-themed thief who laughs at death) and their henchmen. However, Madame Fatal's disguise gave him an edge in physical combat as his foes would underestimate his strength and speed. Madame Fatal's yellow walking cane was also a formidable weapon in Stanton's hands as he was adept at using the cane as a weapon.\n\nMadame Fatal was never a popular character given the cross-dressing angle, which is perhaps part of the reason why DC Comics decided not to further run with the character and limited him to light-hearted jibes made by other comic book heroes.\n\nThe character has often been ridiculed, such as in an article on Cracked.com which listed the character as one of the \"7 crappiest super heroes in comic book history\".\n\nDC Comics acquired the rights to all the former Quality Comics characters in 1956, but Madame Fatal has rarely surfaced.\n\nOutside of regular DC Universe continuity, comix writer Kim Deitch (\"Hollywoodland\") did a story in 1972 that purported to be about Madame Fatal.\n\nJames Robinson and Paul Smith featured Madame Fatal in a cameo in 1993's \"The Golden Age\" #4. The character appears in a panel surrounded by the Fiddler, and the Gambler, who all appear to be courting the cross-dressing hero while other characters (including Wildfire, Harlequin, and the Psycho-Pirate) stand around giggling (apparently knowing Madame Fatal's true gender).\n\nIn a scene in \"JSA\" #1 (Aug. 1999) depicting the funeral of the first Sandman, Wildcat wonders whether his own funeral will \"be like the time they buried Madame Fatal here, and no one turned up for the funeral but the touring cast of \"La Cage aux Folles\"?\"\n\nJames Robinson gives the character a prominent role in \"The Shade\" #4 (2012), set in 1944. In this issue Madame Fatal finally learns the location of his daughter.\n\n\n"}

She became interested in theater while attending San Diego State College, and subsequently pursued an acting career, appearing in stock theater in California. She subsequently signed a contract Warner Bros., and began appearing in their films in 1941. She starred in several films noir, including \"Lady Gangster\" (1942), and Howard Hawks's war film \"Air Force\" (1943). In 1944, she played one of her more memorable roles as Zachary Scott's former lover in \"The Mask of Dimitrios\". From 1944 to 1950, she was married to Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1949, Emerson began hosting \"The Faye Emerson Show\", a late-night talk show series. She went on to become a prolific television interviewer, which earned her the nickname \"The First Lady of Television\". Throughout the 1950s, she also appeared in numerous Broadway stage productions. Emerson formally retired from show business in 1963, and retired to Europe. She resided there until 1983, when she died of stomach cancer in Deià, Spain, aged 65. For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Emerson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. Her star is located at 6529 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nFaye Margaret Emerson was born July 8, 1917 in Elizabeth, Louisiana, the fifth child of Lawrence L. and Jean Emerson. The family moved frequently during her early years, relocating to El Paso, Texas when she was an infant. When she was three years old, her parents separated, and Emerson went to Chicago in 1924 to live with her father and stepmother. At age ten, she moved to San Diego, California to live with her mother, where she spent the remainder of her formative years.\n\nShe became interested in dramatics during her two years attending the Academy of San Luis Rey, a Roman Catholic convent boarding school in Oceanside, California. She went on to attend Point Loma High School and, for one year, San Diego State College. Emerson subsequently joined the St. James Repertory Theater, performing in summer stock productions in California. Emerson married her first husband, William Wallace Crawford, Jr., a naval aviator, on October 29, 1938. The couple had a son, William Wallace \"Scoop\" Crawford, III, in 1940.\n\nIn 1941, while appearing in a stage production of \"Here Today\" at the San Diego Municipal Theater, Emerson was spotted by a talent agent from Warner Bros. studios. She subsequently signed a contract with the studio, appearing in bit parts before having supporting roles in the Western \"Bad Men of Missouri\", and the comedy-drama \"Nine Lives Are Not Enough\" (both released in 1941). She had her first starring role as a female gangster in the film noir \"Lady Gangster\" (1942).\nIn 1943, Emerson met President Franklin D. Roosevelt's son, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt. Howard Hughes was instrumental in bringing the two together when Colonel Roosevelt visited the Hughes Aircraft Company to evaluate the proposed Hughes XF-11. Though Elliott was married, Emerson and he linked up, strongly urged on by the generous efforts of Hughes and his social facilitator, Johnny Meyer. Emerson later asserted that despite her doubts, Hughes urged her to advance the relationship, and she could not defy him. Emerson and Roosevelt married on December 3, 1944, at the rim of Grand Canyon, where she was filming \"Hotel Berlin\". Hughes and Meyer provided the funding and airplanes for the wedding. When Roosevelt went back to Europe, he named his reconnaissance aircraft \"My Faye\". After some months in Beverly Hills in 1945, the couple resided with Eleanor Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York.\n\nEmerson continued to appear in a number of crime dramas, co-starring with Zachary Scott in three: \"The Mask of Dimitrios\" (1944), \"Danger Signal\" (1945) and \"Guilty Bystander\" (1950). She co-starred with John Garfield in the film noir \"Nobody Lives Forever\" and opposite Jane Wyman in another mystery, \"Crime by Night\". A film she made with Van Johnson in 1942, \"Murder in the Big House\", was re-released under a new title later in the decade after Emerson began to make a name for herself in a new medium, television.\n\nBy 1947, Emerson's marriage to Roosevelt had begun to disintegrate. In late 1948, after having made her Broadway debut in \"The Play's the Thing\", Emerson attempted suicide on Christmas Day 1948 by slitting her wrists and was briefly hospitalized. This same year, she had transitioned to television and began acting in various anthology series, including \"The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre\", \"The Philco Television Playhouse\", and \"Goodyear Television Playhouse\". She served as host for several short-lived talk shows and musical/variety shows, including \"Paris Cavalcade of Fashions\" (1948) and \"The Faye Emerson Show\" (CBS, 1950). In January 1950, she obtained a divorce from Roosevelt in Cuernavaca, Mexico. \n\nIn 1949, Emerson began hosting \"The Faye Emerson Show\", which, though it lasted only one season, gave her wide exposure because her time slot immediately followed the \"CBS Evening News\" and alternated weeknights with the popular \"The Perry Como Show\". According to author Gabe Essoe in \"The Book of TV Lists\", on one of the show's segments, her low-cut gown slipped and \"she exposed her ample self coast to coast.\" The show was broadcast from a studio CBS built on the sixth floor of the Stork Club building. The studio, a complete replica of the Stork Club's Cub Room, was built for \"The Stork Club\", also seen on CBS beginning in 1950.\n\nIn 1950, Emerson married band leader and conductor Lyle \"Skitch\" Henderson in Cuernavaca. After \"The Faye Emerson Show\" was cancelled, she continued in television with other talk shows, including \"Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town\" (1951–1952), \"Author Meets the Critics\" (1952), and \"Faye and Skitch\" (1953–54), in the latter of which she appeared with her husband. She made numerous guest appearances on various variety shows and game shows. Emerson hosted or appeared on many talk shows, usually wearing elaborate evening gowns. She was such a frequent panelist on game shows like \"To Tell The Truth\" and \"I've Got a Secret\" that she was known as \"The First Lady of Television\" (although that title was sometimes applied to others, including Ruth Lyons and Lucille Ball). During this time, Emerson was earning up to $200,000 per year.\n\nEmerson and Henderson divorced in 1957 in Acapulco, Mexico. Former brother-in-law James Roosevelt wrote: \"after an incident involving some teen-age girls, [Skitch] was dropped from Johnny Carson's \"Tonight\" TV show, and his career went into eclipse. Emerson's marriage to Skitch hit the skids\". However, the teen-age incident happened before Carson's \"Tonight Show\", which didn't begin until 1962, and Emerson had divorced Henderson in 1957.\n\nWhile appearing on television throughout the 1950s, Emerson also appeared in numerous Broadway productions, including \"Parisienne\" (1950), \"The Heavenly Twins\" (1955), \"Protective Custody\" (1956), and \"Back to Methuselah\" (1958).\n\nIn 1963, Emerson formally retired from show business, and made her final television appearance that year. She subsequently relocated to Europe, residing for a time in Switzerland and then settling in Spain in 1975. Emerson rarely returned to the United States, and spent much of her time in seclusion.\n\nEmerson died on March 9, 1983 at age 65 from stomach cancer in Deià, Majorca, Spain, where she had lived since 1975.\n\n\n\nBecker, Christine, “Glamour Girl Classed as TV Show Brain: The Body and Mind of Faye Emerson,” Journal of Popular Culture (vol. 4 no. 2: Summer 2004): 242-260."}
{"id": "2278102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278102", "title": "Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley", "text": "Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley\n\nChinese communities form a substantial portion of the population of the San Gabriel Valley, just east of Los Angeles, California. The region has achieved international prominence as a hub of overseas Chinese, or \"hua qiao\". Although Chinese immigrants were a noteworthy presence in the establishment of Southern California from the 19th century, significant Chinese migration to suburban San Gabriel Valley coincided with a trend of white out-migration from the 1970s onward. This opened an opportunity for well-educated and affluent Asian Americans to begin settling in the west San Gabriel Valley, primarily to Monterey Park.\n\nHigh property values and overcrowding in Monterey Park have contributed to a secondary movement away from that city, and the Chinese community is now spread over a cluster of cities in the west San Gabriel Valley. Suburban cities in the valley with large non-white populations, also called ethnoburbs, include Alhambra, Arcadia, Rosemead, San Marino, San Gabriel, South Pasadena, and Temple City and then eastward to Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, and Walnut. Numerous Mandarin- and Cantonese-speaking businesses have been established in these suburbs to accommodate the changing population.\n\nThe history of the San Gabriel Valley, like much of the American West, included Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and south Asian settlers and pioneers in the mid-19th century. These Asian settlers worked the fields of grapes, citrus fruits, and other crops. They were also involved in the construction of early infrastructure for San Gabriel Valley. Due to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, the 1942 internment of Japanese, and racial covenant laws, Asian economic and social assimilation were halted for many years. The only Asian cultural hubs were Chinatown and Little Tokyo in Downtown Los Angeles, though populations persisted elsewhere.\n\nIn 1961, Alfred Song became the first Asian American elected to the California State Assembly, representing Monterey Park. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, there has been an influx of some 20 million Asian immigrants to the United States, many of whom settled in Monterey Park due to its close proximity to Chinatown, suburban appeal, and \"superior public education\" to LAUSD. This continued through the 1970s with the arrival of ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam, affluent \"waisheng ren\" Taiwanese, and Mainland Chinese. By 1996, the population of Monterey Park was 65% Asian, primarily Chinese.\n\nGiven the San Gabriel Valley's rapidly increasing population of Asian-Americans (largely Chinese-Americans), several business districts were developed to serve their needs. Since the 1970s, most Chinese immigrants to Los Angeles have preferred the communities in the San Gabriel Valley rather than New Chinatown in Downtown Los Angeles - as it was created by Hollywood film set designers, and seen as 'touristy'. By 2000, many Chinatown residents and businesses had moved to the San Gabriel Valley.\n\nIn 1988, Monterey Park passed an ordinance declaring a moratorium on new building, in an attempt to regulate the rapid growth the city experienced as a result of the influx of Asian immigrants. This moratorium was challenged and defeated in 1989, but it caused many Asian residents and businesses to move to the neighboring city of Alhambra, later spreading to more neighborhoods.\n\nWhile these San Gabriel neighborhoods contain prominent Chinese-language signage, these communities do not feature the Chinese-style gateways, or \"paifang\", found in the original Chinatown.\n\nThe creation of this major hub, a cultural center with many suburban cities, is an \"Asian Pacific American phenomenon\". Rather than solely being a significant Chinese American cultural center, the area is a hub of much more extensive \"multigenerational and multiethnic Asian American diversity.\" In the 21st century, many of the ethnoburbs in the San Gabriel Valley have expanded and thrived, and are becoming increasingly diverse - as well as congested.\n\nThere are several suburban Chinese-oriented ethnoburbs in Southern California, including those in the San Gabriel Valley. Unlike the official Chinatown in downtown Los Angeles, these \"pocket\" communities are not called \"Chinatown\" by the Chinese community there, but generally by the name of the city. Although, Monterey Park has been called the \"First Suburban Chinatown\".\n\nThe Asian communities in the San Gabriel Valley follow along a stretch of Valley Boulevard, covering the entire length of the valley with Alhambra on the west side and Diamond Bar on the east side. Asian communities in the valley extend as far north as San Marino and Arcadia and as far south as Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights.\n\nSan Gabriel has become a brand-name destination for Chinese tourists, especially in the business district around the San Gabriel Mall. This tourism boom is bringing about the construction of additional hotels as many Chinese tourists prefer to rent rooms in San Gabriel, even if they plan to visit typical Southern California tourist destinations.\n\nThe first generation of Chinese Americans in the area identify with 626 — the area code of much of the San Gabriel Valley. They are fluent in English but still identify with the culture of their parents. Many feel that something new has been created, such as songs mixing bits of dialect from across China with American hip-hop. The popularity of Boba, chewy tapioca pearls served in a drink of sweet tea, is a cultural touchstone of \"626.\" Popular food festival 626 Night Market in Arcadia, California was also named after the area code as a \"mecca for the Chinese food-obsessed.\"\n\nFrom the 1970s on, Taiwanese immigrants began settling in Monterey Park and the nearby communities of Alhambra, and Rosemead. The area was not too far from the Los Angeles Chinatown commercial area and was becoming a Chinese influenced community. This trend included affluent Chinese professionals, mostly from Taiwan. At that time, Monterey Park was being marketed by realtors in Taiwan and Hong Kong as the \"Chinese Beverly Hills,\" to entice future investors. The crowded downtown L.A. Chinatown did not have room for the growing numbers of Chinese leaving Taiwan and Hong Kong for economic opportunities in America. Other Mandarin Chinese-speaking immigrants, of the middle and working classes, from Taiwan and Mainland China later followed. Settlement in the city picked up the pace in the 1980s following opportunities created by the white flight from the San Gabriel Valley. Chinese shopping centers—with supermarkets serving as anchors—were developed to serve the new residents. As this unique phenomenon became known, Monterey Park was described as the \"first suburban Chinatown\" in North America, and was featured in \"Forbes\" magazine, \"Time\" magazine, \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Atlantic Monthly\". Monterey Park's effect on tourism in Los Angeles was featured on the \"Life and Times\" show on the L.A. former-PBS affiliate KCET. \nLittle Taipei (Chinese: 小臺北) was an informal name given to the city of Monterey Park, California in the late 1970s because of the large immigrant population from Taiwan. (Taipei is the capital city of Taiwan.) The city council had tried and failed to pass English-only sign ordinances, because of safety issues for police and fire departments. In 1985 the City Council of Monterey Park approved drafting of a proposal that would require all businesses in Monterey Park to display English language identification on business signs. According to the Monterey Park Chamber of Commerce, within the city’s limits, there are more than 60 Chinese restaurants, more than 50 realty companies, several Chinese supermarkets, scores of dental, medical, accounting and legal offices, and dozens of shopping centers.\n\nThe Chinese American population in Monterey Park and San Gabriel Valley is relatively diverse in socioeconomics and region of origin, including overseas Chinese from Vietnam and Indonesia. In Monterey Park, 61.3 percent of the population is Asian American, In Alhambra, Arcadia, and San Gabriel, the Asian population is 48.91 percent, as of the 2000 census. Montebello is also included as it has had a significant (almost 25%) Asian population for several decades after seceding from Monterey Park.\n\nThe city of San Gabriel boasts a mixture of Asian, European, and North American cultures. Second- and third-generation Chinese Americans patronize its diverse array of stores and eateries. There is the \"San Gabriel Square\" mall that has been mentioned in the Los Angeles Times as \"the great mall of China.\" This stretch of Chinese shops and bold architecture, with roofs of Spanish-style tile, is the model for the new ethnoburbs recently recognized in areas like the Las Vegas Valley and Houston. The conglomeration of restaurants and cafes, shops, markets, hair and nail salons, Asian video stores, health services, department stores, plus an extensive jewelry mart, provides 'something for everyone', from purchasing an expensive diamond and shopping for designer suits, to buying soy milk or a travel package to Las Vegas or China.\n\nIn 1992, the city of Alhambra and its southern neighbor Monterey Park jointly held the first annual Chinese new year parade and street festival. There were several conflicts and controversies with Monterey Park, so in the next few years the city of Alhambra has held the parade with its neighbor San Gabriel. The parade and festival have corporate sponsors, and several Chinese-dominant cities in San Gabriel Valley also sponsor the parade. This parade is broadcast on LA Chinese-language radio and on TV. Chi Mui became the city's first Chinese American mayor in 2006. The new San Gabriel Chinese aggregation served as the setting for the thriller novel \"The Jasmine Trade\", authored by Denise Hamilton.\n\nChinese businesses were formerly more spread out in Rowland Heights, an unincorporated area with a Chinese retail corridor on Colima Road and Nogales Street and intermixed with a Korean community. Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese, with number of ethnic Chinese from South Korea, and Vietnam, immigrant businesses, namely the eateries, banks, and offices, are gradually occupying the various strip malls across the Puente Hills Mall and in Hacienda Heights and City of Industry. The population is now 55 percent Asian.\n\nRowland Heights remains the Chinese commercial/cultural center in East San Gabriel. \n\nNearby in Hacienda Heights, Hsi Lai Temple, a Buddhist temple, was built in 1988. Though the proposed development was opposed at the time by some local residents, it is now a respected and accepted part of the community, with members of the United States House of Representatives and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department often visiting during major events. The Hsi Lai Temple is the largest Buddhist temple in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nIn addition to Rowland Heights and Hacienda Heights, Eastern San Gabriel Valley areas with a high percentage of Asian residents are West Covina, Walnut, and Diamond Bar.\n\nAs of the 2000 census, the racial makeup of Temple City was 38.89% Asian, that number is expected to be significantly higher in 2010 census. Along Las Tunas Boulevard, the \"Bridal District\" of Asian businesses along the stretch of the downtown area has made Temple City a bride's \"mecca\" for all wedding needs including elaborate dresses, as Asian brides often wear three gowns. Also included are several florists and lavish portrait studios supporting the Asian tradition of taking studio quality photos of the bride and groom before the wedding. Asian brides come from as far away as New York City to visit this Temple City specialty sector.\n\nValley Boulevard (former U.S. Route 60 and U.S. Route 99) is a vital and growing professional and business sector that includes many Asian markets, eateries and other service-oriented businesses such as physicians and dentists. There are multiple Asian banks and Asian owned and operated enterprises that accommodate the burgeoning Asian population.\n\nThe Asian communities in the San Gabriel Valley follow along a stretch of Valley Boulevard covering the entire length of the San Gabriel Valley with Alhambra on the west side and Diamond Bar on the east side.\n\nValley Boulevard begins at Lincoln Park, off North Main Street near downtown Los Angeles, about a mile northeast of the downtown Los Angeles Chinatown. From North Main Street, Valley runs east along a five-mile (8 km) stretch including large industrial tracts and the largely Hispanic community of Lincoln Heights. Midway between Chinatown, and the start of the ethnic Chinese suburbs to the east, is the Ming Ya Buddhist Temple in Lincoln Heights.\n\nLeaving Los Angeles, Valley Boulevard enters Alhambra, the \"Gateway to the San Gabriel Valley\". Alhambra, which is 47% Asian according to the 2000 census, has a large number of Asian businesses along the Boulevard. This area boasts numerous noodle shops, Asian cafés, and the original Sam Woo Barbecue restaurant. The artful Wing Lung Bank features the largest glass tile mural in North America, composed of 996,000 3/4\" glass tiles. Each year, Alhambra and San Gabriel host one of the largest Lunar Chinese New Year celebrations in the country which includes a parade along Valley Boulevard.\n\nContinuing east are the cities of San Gabriel and Rosemead, with San Marino, Temple City and Arcadia being further north and east. These five cities have Asian populations between 40 and 55% with a large number of Asian businesses in their various town centers. As existing homes are torn down, the size and skyrocketing prices of new houses is remaking Arcadia's reputation. Homes are being constructed in Arcadia to appeal to wealthy Chinese buyers.\n\nAlong Valley Boulevard in San Gabriel are dozens of Asian mini-malls and hundreds of shops and restaurants. San Gabriel Square is one of the most prominent and features a 99 Ranch Market, several shops and restaurants including specialties such as Taiwanese and Vegetarian food. This area also includes the comprehensive San Gabriel Superstore which includes multiple vendors anchored by a large grocery store. Inside and outside the Superstore are found numerous vendors of Asian art, jewelry, books, videos, clothing as well as health and beauty aids. This area is known for its tofu and dumpling houses.\n\nContinuing east from Rosemead along Valley Boulevard are the largely Hispanic communities of El Monte and La Puente and large industrial tracts, including those that dominate the City of Industry. This ten-mile-long (16 km) largely industrial corridor includes many Asian owned wholesale businesses, including importers of electronics, food and furniture from Asia. North of La Puente is West Covina which is 26% Asian and south of La Puente is Hacienda Heights which is 36% Asian. Hacienda Heights is home to the Hsi Lai Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in the United States. The temple encompasses and a floor area of . The temple's Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD) and Qing Dynasty (1644–1911 AD) architecture is faithful to the traditional style of buildings, Chinese gardens, and statuary of ancient Chinese monasteries. Hsi Lai was built to serve as a spiritual and cultural center for those interested in learning Buddhism and Chinese culture.\n\nOn the east side of the San Gabriel Valley, before Valley Boulevard becomes Holt Avenue in Pomona, are the communities of Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut and Diamond Bar. These three communities each have Asian populations of between about 40 to 60%. Rowland Heights and western parts of Hacienda Heights offers its own small ethnic suburbia, such as the businesses lining Azusa Avenue, Colima Road (about one mile (1.6 km) south of Valley), Fullerton Road, Gale Avenue (about half mile south of Valley) and Nogales Street. Indoor malls in Rowland Heights feature restaurants and chic Asian boutiques.\n\nAsian-American ethnoburbs can be found in the South Bay, Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley, and may include South Asians. These include are Sawtelle (West Los Angeles), San Pedro (due to its proximity to the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach) and Pasadena, though Pasandena's historic Japantowns are no longer hubs of the Japanese American communities. The towns of Artesia, Cerritos; Gardena; Hawaiian Gardens; La Mirada; Lakewood; Long Beach; Lomita; Norwalk; Redondo Beach; Torrance and Whittier have some Asian-American neighborhoods and businesses/malls.\n\nExperts said they predict more Asian-oriented supermarkets of these types to open in other Inland cities in coming years, including Corona, California, whose Asian population jumped from 8 percent to 11 percent from 2000 to 2005. Also for Rancho Cucamonga, whose Asian population rose from 6 percent in 2000 to 8 percent in 2005.\n\nOther Asian ethnoburbs in Southern California are in Orange County such as Anaheim, Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Laguna Beach, Laguna Niguel, La Palma, Orange and Westminster.\n\nChinese and Asian-American ethnoburbs also can be found in Chino, Chino Hills, San Bernardino, Calico a section of Barstow, Fontana, Riverside, Moreno Valley, San Jacinto, Desert Hot Springs north of Palm Springs, Victorville, Loma Linda and elsewhere (I.e. the San Diego area, Bakersfield and San Luis Obispo).\n\nOutside the Greater Los Angeles Area, Chinese ethnoburbs are also found in the San Francisco Bay Area, where ethnic Chinese populations are largely concentrated in cities of the East Bay and Santa Clara County. The most prominent Chinese ethnoburb in the region is found in the city of Milpitas, which has a population that is over 60% Asian as of the 2010 U.S. Census. Chinese-oriented shopping centers, markets, and community centers are spread around the city. Other suburbs which have large Chinese populations and commercial activity include Fremont, Cupertino, San Leandro and Sunnyvale, with the former two having majority Asian American populations and the latter two with plurality Asian American populations as of the 2010 U.S. Census.\n\nList of cities and CDP with Chinese American (Including Taiwanese American) population, according to the 2011-2015 American Community Survey and the 2010 United States Census.\n\n"}

Most are known by the common name pondweed, although many unrelated plants may be called pondweed, such as Canadian pondweed (\"Elodea canadensis\"). The genus name means \"river neighbor\", originating from the Greek \"potamos\" (river) and \"geiton\" (neighbor).\n\n\"Potamogeton\" species range from large (stems of 6 m or more) to very small (less than 10 cm). Height is strongly influenced by environmental conditions, particularly water depth. All species are technically perennial, but some species disintegrate in autumn to a large number of asexually produced resting buds called turions, which serve both as a means of overwintering and dispersal. Turions may be borne on the rhizome, on the stem, or on stolons from the rhizome. Most species, however, persist by perennial creeping rhizomes. In some cases the turions are the only means to differentiate species.\n\nThe leaves are alternate, which contrasts with the closely related genus \"Groenlandia\", where the leaves are opposite or whorled. In many species, all the leaves are submerged, and in these cases, they are typically thin and translucent. Some species, especially in ponds and very slow-moving waters, have floating leaves which tend to be opaque with a leathery texture. Leaf shape has been found to be highly plastic, with variability due to changes in light, water chemistry, planting depth, sediment conditions, temperature, photo period, waves, and seasonality. All \"Potamogeton\" have a delicate membranous sheathing scale, the stipule, at the leaf axil. This may be wholly attached, partly attached, or free of the leaf, and it may have inrolled margins or appear as a tube. The morphology of the stipule is an important character for species identification. The stems have small scales.\n\nThe flowers, which are often overlooked, are greenish-brown and are composed of four rounded segments borne in a spike. They are 2-4 merous, with superior ovaries and anthers that turn outward. The fruits are spheroidal and green to brown, usually 1–3 mm in diameter, with a noticeable 'beak'. Their pollen is inaperturate, monad, apolar and spherical.\n\nMost fine-leaved pondweeds are diploid, with 2n = 26 (such as \"P. pusillus\" or \"P. trichoides\") or less commonly 28 (\"P. compressus\", \"P. acutifolius\"). Broad-leaved taxa are mainly tetraploid, with 2n = 52 (e.g. \"P. alpinus\", \"P. praelongus\"), but a few species are diploid (e.g. \"P. coloratus\" or octaploid (2n = 104)(e.g. \"P. illinoensis\").\n\n\"Potamogeton\" is a genus of freshwater aquatic plants in the Potamogetonaceae. Molecular analysis has identified \"Groenlandia\" as the sister group to \"Potamogeton,\" although the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group also lists \"Zannichellia,\" \"Althenia\" and \"Pseudoalthenia\" as closely related genera. Some researchers have used molecular analysis and pollen grain shape to argue for the placement of \"Stuckenia\" at the genus level, but others have argued there is not enough difference to justify the change, and have kept \"Stuckenia\" as a subgenus of \"Potamogeton.\"\n\nThe genus is generally divided into two groups: broad-leaved and linear-leaved. The broad-leaved group includes such species as \"P. natans\", \"P. perfoliatus\" and \"P. alpinus\". The linear-leaved group includes such species as \"P. rutilus\", \"P. compressus\" and \"P. berchtoldii\". Series \"Batrachoseris\" historically contained only one species, \"Potamogeton crispus,\" however more recent research has also added \"P. maackianus\" and \"P. robbinsii\" into this grouping. These general divisions have been supported by molecular analysis, except that \"P. crispus\" clusters with broad-leaved species in section \"Potamogeton\".\n\nIn a detailed review of the genus, Wiegleb and Kaplan recognised 69 species, but the variability of many species means that there is disagreement regarding the exact number of species. Currently, the number of accepted names is 94. Hybridisation provides an added complexity to the taxonomy.\n\n\"Potamogeton\" species are found worldwide in many aquatic ecosystems. However, the greatest diversity of species occurs in the northern hemisphere, especially in North America, which is thought to be where the genus originated. Molecular evidence suggests that several independent colonizations of the southern hemisphere have occurred. However, due to their self-propagation from turions, \"Potamogeton\" populations show very low infrapopulation diversity, especially when living in deep, shaded or turbulent water where colonies do not expend energy on flowers. This has made it very difficult to use genetic data to find patterns of geographical differentiation.\n\n\"Potamogeton\" species hybridise freely. At least 27 hybrids have been observed in the British Isles alone, and more than 50 worldwide, of which 36 have been confirmed using genetic techniques. The majority of these are sterile, but many are long-lived and may occur in the absence of one or even both parents. Most hybrids have been described between broad-leaved species, but this probably reflects the relative scarcity of characters among fine-leaved taxa, so that hybrids are much more difficult to identify. Use of genetic markers suggests that hybrid taxa are also reasonably frequent among fine-leaved species. At least one species, \"P. obtusifolius\", is thought to have arisen via hybridisation.\n\nSeveral species of European pondweeds, including \"P. natans\", \"P. lucens\" and \"P. crispus\", were included in Linnaeus's \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753. Much of the European \"Potamogeton\" flora was subsequently named during the late 18th and early 19th century. As botanists ventured further afield, pondweeds began to be collected and named from other parts of the world. The North America flora was largely named by the start of the 20th century. \nAlfred Fryer became interested in \"Potamogeton\" in the 1880s, and was a recognised authority on the genus. The first parts of his work \"The Potamogetons (Pond Weeds) of the British Isles\" were published in 1898. His death intervened, and the work was completed by Arthur Bennett (1843-1929), who named a large number of specimens sent to him from around the world. Robert Morgan (1863-1900) illustrated Fryer's contribution to the monograph, his colour plates drawing praise from later critics.\n\nIn 1916, Johan Hagström published \"Critical researches on the Potamogetons\" from detailed measurements of dozens of vegetative, anatomical and reproductive characteristics such as fruit beak, peduncle rigidity and leaf apex across hundreds of specimens. It was a pioneering work that preceded the development of cladistics by more than 30 years, and his clustering of groups into broad-leaf and linear-leaf is still considered the framework for all subsequent classification systems of \"Potamogeton.\" Hagström's work was developed further by Merritt Fernald (1873-1950) who created a detailed phylogeny for the linear-leaved species, and by Eugene Ogden who did so for the broad-leaved species.\n\nNew species continue to be described from less well-studied areas such as Asia and Africa, and it is possible that molecular analysis may reveal hitherto unknown cryptic species.\n\nThe following list is based on the latest listing of valid \"Potamogeton\" taxa held on The Plant List.\n\n\nReproduction of pondweeds occurs both vegetatively and by seed, though studies suggest that in some species or situations reproduction by seed is rare. The fruits may be produced in large quantities from midsumer onwards, and are ingested by waterfowl. Germination experiments have shown that the seeds are viable after passing through the digestive tracts of birds and this mechanism is probably the only natural mechanism for long-distance dispersal between isolated water bodies. Vegetative propagation occurs by a variety of mechanisms including turions, and via growth and fragmentation of rhizomes and shoots. Vegetative reproduction is evidently an effective means of ensuring local persistence, as sterile hybrids have been recorded at some sites for over 100 years.\n\nAlthough they occur in a range of environments, most species prefer standing or slow-flowing waters with some calcium and fairly low nutrient levels. In general the fine-leaved species are more tolerant of human impacts such as eutrophication. They are important as food and habitat for animals including insect larvae, water snails, ducks and other waterfowl, and aquatic mammals such as beavers.\n\nMost species are not weedy, but a few can become troublesome, such as curly-leaf pondweed (\"Potamogeton crispus\").\n\nIn relation to the ecosystem as a whole, \"Potamogeton \"is often a common habitat for insects. For example, \"C. annularius\" and other insects from the \"Chironomus \"genera have been found to inhabit and mate around certain species of \"Potamogeton\". The closeness to a fresh water source as well as cover from predators allows \"C. annularius\" to thrive.\n"}

{"id": "2278116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2278116", "title": "Special right triangle", "text": "Special right triangle\n\nA special right triangle is a right triangle with some regular feature that makes calculations on the triangle easier, or for which simple formulas exist. For example, a right triangle may have angles that form simple relationships, such as 45°–45°–90°. This is called an \"angle-based\" right triangle. A \"side-based\" right triangle is one in which the lengths of the sides form ratios of whole numbers, such as 3 : 4 : 5, or of other special numbers such as the golden ratio. Knowing the relationships of the angles or ratios of sides of these special right triangles allows one to quickly calculate various lengths in geometric problems without resorting to more advanced methods.\n\n\"Angle-based\" special right triangles are specified by the relationships of the angles of which the triangle is composed. The angles of these triangles are such that the larger (right) angle, which is 90 degrees or radians, is equal to the sum of the other two angles.\n\nThe side lengths are generally deduced from the basis of the unit circle or other geometric methods. This approach may be used to rapidly reproduce the values of trigonometric functions for the angles 30°, 45°, and 60°.\n\nSpecial triangles are used to aid in calculating common trigonometric functions, as below:\n\nThe 45°–45°–90° triangle, the 30°–60°–90° triangle, and the equilateral/equiangular (60°–60°–60°) triangle are the three Möbius triangles in the plane, meaning that they tessellate the plane via reflections in their sides; see Triangle group.\n\nIn plane geometry, constructing the diagonal of a square results in a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 1 : 2, adding up to 180° or radians. Hence, the angles respectively measure 45° (), 45° (), and 90° (). The sides in this triangle are in the ratio 1 : 1 : , which follows immediately from the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nOf all right triangles, the 45°–45°–90° degree triangle has the smallest ratio of the hypotenuse to the sum of the legs, namely . and the greatest ratio of the altitude from the hypotenuse to the sum of the legs, namely .\n\nTriangles with these angles are the only possible right triangles that are also isosceles triangles in Euclidean geometry. However, in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, there are infinitely many different shapes of right isosceles triangles.\n\nThis is a triangle whose three angles are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 and respectively measure 30° (), 60° (), and 90° (). The sides are in the ratio 1 :  : 2.\n\nThe proof of this fact is clear using trigonometry. The geometric proof is:\n\nThe 30°–60°–90° triangle is the only right triangle whose angles are in an arithmetic progression. The proof of this fact is simple and follows on from the fact that if \"α\", , are the angles in the progression then the sum of the angles = 180°. After dividing by 3, the angle must be 60°. The right angle is 90°, leaving the remaining angle to be 30°.\n\nRight triangles whose sides are of integer lengths, with the sides collectively known as Pythagorean triples, possess angles that cannot all be rational numbers of degrees. (This follows from Niven's theorem.) They are most useful in that they may be easily remembered and any multiple of the sides produces the same relationship. Using Euclid's formula for generating Pythagorean triples, the sides must be in the ratio\n\nwhere \"m\" and \"n\" are any positive integers such that .\n\nThere are several Pythagorean triples which are well-known, including those with sides in the ratios:\n\nThe 3 : 4 : 5 triangles are the only right triangles with edges in arithmetic progression. Triangles based on Pythagorean triples are Heronian, meaning they have integer area as well as integer sides.\n\nThe possible use of the 3 : 4 : 5 triangle in Ancient Egypt, with the supposed use of a knotted rope to lay out such a triangle, and the question whether Pythagoras' theorem was known at that time, have been much debated. It was first conjectured by the historian Moritz Cantor in 1882. It is known that right angles were laid out accurately in Ancient Egypt; that their surveyors did use ropes for measurement; that Plutarch recorded in \"Isis and Osiris\" (around 100 AD) that the Egyptians admired the 3 : 4 : 5 triangle; and that the Berlin Papyrus 6619 from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (before 1700 BC) stated that \"the area of a square of 100 is equal to that of two smaller squares. The side of one is ½ + ¼ the side of the other.\" The historian of mathematics Roger L. Cooke observes that \"It is hard to imagine anyone being interested in such conditions without knowing the Pythagorean theorem.\" Against this, Cooke notes that no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle's sides, and that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle. Cooke concludes that Cantor's conjecture remains uncertain: he guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but that \"there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles\". \n\nThe following are all the Pythagorean triple ratios expressed in lowest form (beyond the five smallest ones in lowest form in the list above) with both non-hypotenuse sides less than 256:\n\nIsosceles right-angled triangles cannot have sides with integer values, because the ratio of the hypotenuse to either other side is , but cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. However, infinitely many \"almost-isosceles\" right triangles do exist. These are right-angled triangles with integral sides for which the lengths of the non-hypotenuse edges differ by one. Such almost-isosceles right-angled triangles can be obtained recursively,\n\n\"a\" is length of hypotenuse, \"n\" = 1, 2, 3, ... Equivalently,\n\nwhere {\"x\", \"y\"} are the solutions to the Pell equation , with the hypotenuse \"y\" being the odd terms of the Pell numbers 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378... .. The smallest Pythagorean triples resulting are:\n\nAlternatively, the same triangles can be derived from the square triangular numbers.\n\nThe Kepler triangle is a right triangle whose sides are in a geometric progression. If the sides are formed from the geometric progression \"a\", \"ar\", \"ar\" then its common ratio \"r\" is given by \"r\" = where \"φ\" is the golden ratio. Its sides are therefore in the ratio . Thus, the shape of the Kepler triangle is uniquely determined (up to a scale factor) by the requirement that its sides be in a geometric progression.\n\nThe 3–4–5 triangle is the unique right triangle (up to scaling) whose sides are in an arithmetic progression.\n\nLet be the side length of a regular decagon inscribed in the unit circle, where \"φ\" is the golden ratio. Let be the side length of a regular hexagon in the unit circle, and let {2}}</math>}} be the side length of a regular pentagon in the unit circle. Then , so these three lengths form the sides of a right triangle. The same triangle forms half of a golden rectangle. It may also be found within a regular icosahedron of side length \"c\": the shortest line segment from any vertex \"V\" to the plane of its five neighbors has length \"a\", and the endpoints of this line segment together with any of the neighbors of \"V\" form the vertices of a right triangle with sides \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\".\n\n\n"}

In 2007, Har Gilo had a population of 462. According to Peace Now, Har Gilo breaks the territorial contiguity of a Palestinian state and its close proximity to Al Walaja and Beit Jala will make it difficult to include within Israel's final boundaries.

Its first release was in 1985 for MSX computer systems. Many titles were made in the series and the gameplay is almost exactly the same in every game as well. Only a few changes were made over the years (mainly graphical).\n\nThe hero of most games is Lolo, a blue, spherical character with eyes, arms, and legs. The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, capturing princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only colored pink or red, and wearing a bow. Lolo must rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.\n\nMany video games of the Eggerland series were only released in Japan and some only in the West. Below is a list of all video games and their respective releases.\n\nAlthough the graphics and game engine of the Japanese \"Adventures of Lolo\" are identical to those of the Western \"Adventures of Lolo 2\", the stages are different and harder. They are actually separate video games. The Japanese \"Adventures of Lolo 1 & 2\" include original stages, whereas the American \"Adventures of Lolo 1 & 2\" are compilations of stages taken from earlier Japan-only titles. The American \"Adventures of Lolo 3\" includes mostly original stages, instead.\n\nThe player must guide Lolo through a room of 11×11 tiles and have Lolo collect all of the Heart Framers (sometimes referred to as HFs) in the room. Doing so opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item (sometimes a key or jewel). Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Players need to navigate Lolo past the many monsters seen throughout the rooms — some are harmless while others are deadly. For more information on the monsters, skip ahead to the Monsters section.\n\nLolo's only weapon is a Magic Shot. Two shots (and always two shots) are obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers (sometimes referred to as SF's for Shot Framers). Heart Framers containing magic shots are not differentiated in appearance from regular Heart Framers. Collecting a Heart Framer that does contain magic shots, however, is normally indicated by a different sound effect than a regular Heart Framer's. Magic shots allow Lolo to temporarily turn enemies into Eggs, which can be pushed around, but not pulled. Monsters in eggs will hatch after a few seconds. If Lolo shoots an egg a second time, it will fly off the screen, though the monster will reappear at its original starting point a few seconds later. Reappearance is typically indicated by an outlined box of sorts and then the monster physically appearing very shortly afterward. Lolo may move through the outlined box unhindered.\n\nIf a monster's starting point is covered with an Emerald Framer or another monster and there are no warp holes in the level, the monster will not return to the level. Lolo himself cannot cover a monster's starting point to cause this to happen. If Lolo is on a monster's starting point and it reappears, Lolo will be \"on top\" of the monster and can usually walk off of it, though some monsters like Almas or Skulls will kill Lolo if he is standing on their starting points.\n\nThere are various types of terrain and obstacles in the levels. Emerald Framers, or EFs, are green blocks that Lolo may push around freely, but he cannot pull them. Lolo cannot push multiple, stacked EFs at one time. This is similar to the game Sokoban. EFs are typically used to block dangerous monsters or ranged attacks from other monsters. One type of terrain is the grass (sometimes called flower bed), which Lolo may walk freely on, yet any mobile monster cannot enter the grass on its own. If Lolo pushes a monster in an egg onto the grass, the monster will try to walk off after the egg hatches. Another type of terrain is the sand. Lolo will only move at half speed while on the sand, but any mobile monster is unaffected by the sand's slowing effects. If Lolo is only halfway on the sand, he will not be affected.\n\nSome other obstacles include trees and rocks. Both of these block movement from Lolo and monsters. Monsters that have a ranged attack, like Medusas or Gols, can shoot through the trees, but Lolo cannot. Rocks prevent shots from both Lolo and monsters. Another obstacle is the one-way arrows. Lolo can enter these arrows from any direction except the direction the arrow is pointing. For instance, if the arrow is pointing up, Lolo cannot walk down against the arrow. One-way arrows do not stop monsters in any way, nor do they prevent any shots from Lolo or monsters.\n\nSome levels contain water or lava. Neither prevent shots from Lolo nor monsters from going through and both prohibit movement from Lolo and monsters. There are sometimes bridges going over the water and lava and both Lolo and mobile monsters can cross the bridges freely. With water, Lolo can push a monster in an egg onto the water to act as a temporary bridge. Typically, levels are laid out so Lolo can go to the other side of the waterway. An egg sinks quickly after being pushed into the water. If Lolo is on an egg and it sinks, Lolo will be killed. Some waterways even have currents which Lolo can ride eggs on to other parts of the level. Eggs will sink upon reaching the end of the current. An egg that sinks in the water will remove the monster from the level temporarily, but the monster will reappear in its original starting point (just like hitting it as an egg with a second magic shot). There can only be one egg on any water part of the level at any time. A second egg may \"not\" be put into the water until the first one sinks. Eggs may not be pushed into the lava.\n\nAnother tricky obstacle that was only featured in \"Adventures of Lolo 3\" is the crumbling bridge. These bridges can only be crossed twice. The first time will make the bridge crack. The second time, the bridge will crumble away, leaving either water or lava behind. Lolo must be fully on the bridge to qualify it for being crossed. If Lolo only walks halfway on these bridges and walks off, they will not be damaged. Any monster walking over these bridges will not cause any damage to them.\n\nOne final trick that appears in most games are the warp holes. Some levels, but not all, have pre-defined locations for a monster to alternately appear if it is removed from the screen \"and\" its original starting point is covered. Its starting point may be covered with an EF or another monster. Also, an object need only cover a part of the original point. For instance, if an EF were only on 1/4 of the monster's original starting point, this would be sufficient enough to cover it. Lolo himself cannot cover a monster's starting point and cause it to be sent to a hole. For a demonstration of how a warp hole works, see the adjacent image showing a 3-step process.\n\nThe holes go in a numbered order and the monsters go to the lowest numbered hole available. If there were two holes, for instance, and both the monster's starting point and the first hole were covered, the monster would go to the second hole. Many games had a maximum limit of 8 holes per level, though rarely ever used this many.\n\nOne important thing to remember is that the monster's original spot needs to stay covered to send it to a hole. If Lolo removes a monster that was sent to a hole and its \"original\" starting point was uncovered, it would not continue going to the hole, but rather back to its original starting point. Though in some rooms, monsters may need to be sent back to their original starting point in order to solve the room.\n\nIf a monster is in the process of reappearing and Lolo covers its spot while this is happening (i.e. when the outlined box indicating a monster is about to reappear is there and gets covered), the reappearing process will fail and the monster will be permanently removed from the level. It will \"not\" be sent to a hole.\n\nIn some levels, Lolo can obtain certain powers to help him. These powers include the Hammer, the Bridge, and the Arrow Turn (sometimes called a One-Way Pass). To obtain a power, Lolo must collect a certain amount of hearts, which is pre-defined in the data for any level that gives a power. This value varies from level to level. The maximum amount of powers a level can have is three. If the next heart to be collected will give Lolo a power, all hearts in the room will flash as an indicator.\n\nTo use any of these powers, Lolo simply needs to face the respective obstacle the power is used for and use the magic shot button. For arrows, Lolo may be facing the arrow from any direction, though care must be taken to ensure that Lolo is standing in the proper position, or a shot will be fired by accident instead.\n\n\n is a 1985 puzzle game for MSX computer systems produced by HAL Laboratory. It is the first game in the \"Eggerland\" series. Its main characters are named Lolo and Lala\n\nEggerland 2, known in Japan as , is a 1986 puzzle game for the MSX2 produced by HAL Laboratory. It is the sequel to the original \"Eggerland Mystery\" and the second game in the \"Eggerland\" series. The game is often referred to as \"Shodai\" (初代), or the \"first \"Eggerland\"\". The game features a total of 122 stages; the game is therefore presented in a 10-by-10 grid, plus 22 extra stages.\n\n is a puzzle video game developed by HAL Laboratory for the Family Computer. It was released in 1988 in Japan as the fourth game in the \"Eggerland\" series following \"Eggerland Mystery\", and is the third in the series not counting the port of \"Eggerland 2\" made for the Famicom Disk System. The game contains roughly 162 stages (or maps), which are arranged on an 8-by-16 grid (with some stages hidden). This entry in the series would serve as the basis for \"Eggerland – Departure to Creation\", which reuses \"Revival of the Labyrinth\"'s core gameplay and presentation.\n\nThis game is more linear than its predecessor: Lolo (the player) can choose to go in two different directions only in a dozen of rooms. Similar to the key that is used to access new rooms of the dungeon, the raft makes its second debut in the series as a room-completion prize which allows Lolo entry to the water courses in the southwest region of the game. \"Revival of the Labyrinth\" also has special inventory items that Lolo can collect along the way, such as a map and a \"Magic Bell\". Differences from \"Eggerland 2\"/FDS include the absence of time-based levels with special keys and Guardians/Gods as their prizes. Instead, these are given out for defeating rooms that lead to only one other room in the dungeon. Rather than the small key used to enter new rooms, the player may occasionally receive one of the game's special keys, which are used to open special doorways normal keys cannot open, and four of these special keys are used to access rooms closed off from the main dungeon map to obtain pieces of a large King Egger tablet required for access to the final levels of the game. Two other items that can also be obtained from chests are the map, which retains its usage from \"Eggerland 2\", and a new item: the Magic Bell, which rings in four specific rooms of the castle that contain entrances to special dungeons that if completed, award the player with one of the four Gods needed to finish the final rooms of the game, in a similar fashion to the Guardians from \"Eggerland 2\". These entrances to the God dungeons are not revealed like they were in the previous game; where the player had to move one specific Emerald Frame after the room's completion; Here the player has to align the Emerald Framers in a particular pattern to reveal the entrance. Alongside the Gods, Lolo can also encounter Buddhas that give out information in certain empty rooms.\n\n is a Japanese puzzle video game in the \"Eggerland\" series by HAL Laboratory. It was published for the Family Computer Disk System in 1988. The game comprises 50 stages (\"maps\"), and progresses linearly (unlike previous titles, such as \"Meikyū Shinwa\" and \"Eggerland – Revival of the Labyrinth\"). \"Construction Mode\" enables the player to create a custom map. The game is shorter than earlier \"Eggerland\" titles, and many of the maps are reproduced from \"Eggerland Mystery\".\n\n"}

It was closed down by the British authorities for violating contemporary standards of obscenity.\n\n\"The Pearl\" ran for eighteen issues from July 1879 to December 1880, with two Christmas supplements. As an underground publication, it was limited to 150 copies and cost twenty-five pounds, which made it unusually expensive relative to comparable contemporaneous pornographic periodicals. The Christmas Annual, a crudely produced supplement that ran sixty pages, sold for three guineas. Only the special numbers contained illustrations. The publisher and editor, William Lazenby, also wrote some of the content. The magazine was distributed discreetly through mail order. Based on the cost and subject matter, the target audience appears to have been middle- and upper-class professionals. Two of the flagellant poems were composed by Algernon Charles Swinburne, though it is unclear whether he authorized their publication. The format of the magazine, in combining a mix of short stories, serial fiction, current events, and letters to the editor, parodied contemporary family magazines such as \"Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine,\" which itself contained depictions of corporal punishment. Parts of the magazine were later compiled and translated into German.\n\nAfter the magazine was shut down, Lazenby would go on to publish three subsequent pornographic magazines, \"The Cremorne\" (1882), \"The Oyster\" (1883), and \"The Boudoir\" (1883). The popularity of pornographic magazines like \"The Pearl\" was part of a trend that began in the 1860s of capitalizing on the profitability of writing about sex, which served to proliferate discourses about sexuality by the time of the \"fin de siècle\" in England.\n\nThe general format of the periodical was to publish three serial erotic tales simultaneously, devoted to sex in high society, incest, and flagellation, respectively. The novels, six in total, were interspersed with limericks, hymns, odes, songs, facetious nursery rhymes, acrostic poems, parodies, faux advertisements, and fabricated letters to the editor. The topics depicted in the novels and poems were wide-ranging, including women's suffrage, physical disability, sexual impairment, secret sex societies, bestiality, India-rubber dildos, slave rape, duels, mock crucifixions, Turkish harems, and prophylactic devices. \"The Pearl\" often contained extensive political commentary, including references to the Reform Bills and Contagious Diseases Acts, and portrayed or alluded to many controversial public figures, including Annie Besant, Charles Spurgeon, Wilfrid Lawson, Newman Hall, Edmund Burke, William Gladstone, and Robert Peel.\n\n\"The Pearl\" contains the first obscene tale about slavery in the Americas. The story, entitled \"My Grandmother's Tale\", depicts the brutal sexualized flogging of a black West Indian slave girl by an overseer of ambiguous racial background acting under the authority of a white plantation owner.\n\n\"The Pearl\"'s serial novel \"Lady Pokingham\", in which a consumptive invalid recounts her sexual adventures from a wheelchair, has been noted for its depiction of transience, bodily decay, and death, which thus provides counter-evidence to the idea advanced by Steven Marcus that Victorian pornography portrays a pornotopia.\n\nSwinburne’s flagellant writings from \"The Pearl\" have been cited in British legal arguments as evidence against the safety and utility of corporal punishment in schools.\n\nIn 2011 an Australian alderman was convicted for possession of \"child exploitation material\" because a digital copy of \"The Pearl\" was found on his laptop. Greg Barns, the director of Australian Lawyers Alliance, noted that the conviction would imply criminality for possession of any number of works of art and literature, and media reports pointed out that Harper Collins had republished the magazine in 2009, and was currently available on Amazon. When the Victorian origins of the materials were identified on appeal, the conviction was set aside.\n\nA selection from the story \"Lady Pokingham\" is read during a scene in the 2012 film \"The Master\".\n\n\"The Pearl\"s characters and venues, being Victoriana, are featured in \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" by Alan Moore. A girls' school seems to be haunted by a ghost (The \"Holy Spirit\") that is raping and impregnating the students. The headmistress is Rosa Coote, a character from one of \"The Pearl's\" serials. The \"Holy Spirit\" turns out to be Hawley Griffin, the Invisible Man.\n\n\n\n"}

He amassed 146 caps playing for Mexico while scoring 11 goals.\n\nPardo spent most of his career playing with Club América and is the second most capped player in Mexico national team history. Pardo participated in two World Cups (1998 and 2006), won two CONCACAF Gold Cups and won the FIFA Confederations Cup with Mexico in 1999.\n\nPardo started his career in 1993 with Atlas de Guadalajara, and also played with Tecos UAG before joining Club América. A veteran of 467 games with 35 goals at club level and 139 international caps, scoring 10 goals. He is regarded as one of the best players in Mexico, having achieved great success with Club América, winning both the Mexican \"Torneo de Verano\" 2002, \"Torneo de Clausura\" in 2005 and the CONCACAF Champions Cup tournament in 2006.\n\nAfter participating with Mexico in high-profile tournaments, namely the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, both of which were held in Germany, Pardo began to attract attention from a number of international clubs. Rumors linked him with River Plate of Argentina and Recreativo Huelva of Spain, however Pardo was unable to reach an agreement with either club.\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Pardo joined VfB Stuttgart, for a sum of one million euros, the same club that purchased Pardo's national teammate, Ricardo Osorio. Pardo scored his first goal for Stuttgart in a 16 September 2006 league contest and win against Werder Bremen.\n\nOn 19 May 2007, Stuttgart won the Bundesliga with Pardo, who appeared in 33 complete games, serving as one of the pillars of the team. He was voted the fifth-best player in his first season in Germany.\n\nIn January 2009, he returned to Club América for a fee of US $600,000.\nIn July 2011, Pardo revealed he would be signing with a Major League Soccer team after America allowed him to terminate his contract with them and thus sign on a free transfer with MLS, and signed with the Chicago Fire on 26 July 2011. Pardo re-signed with Chicago for the 2012 season on 18 January 2012.\n\nOn 19 January 2013, Pardo announced his retirement from football.\n\nPardo made his international debut for Mexico in 1996, playing in the U.S. Cup tournament, against the USA. Since then, Pardo has captained his country in several occasions and played important roles for the national team for many years, helping his country to winning the 1998 and 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournaments and the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup. He played in France 98, as well as the 1997 Copa América and 1999 and the mentioned 2005 Confederations Cup and 2006 World Cup.\n\nAt the 1998 World Cup, Pardo was sent off in the match between Belgium and Mexico. Referee Hugh Dallas was criticised for his actions during the game after he also sent off Gert Verheyen.\n\nOn 21 June 2007, he played in the 2007 Gold Cup, helping Mexico earn second place. The day after the game he announced that he would not go to 2007 Copa América because he needed some rest. The national side eventually ended up in third place in that tournament.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, his second year in Stuttgart, he established himself as one of the leading players, due to his constant and solid performances and also because, at 32, he was one of the older players in the otherwise young \"VfB\" side. Therefore, he earned the nickname \"el comandante\" or \"el jefe\" in the team.\n\nOn 20 August 2008, he helped Mexico to a 2–1 win over Honduras at home in their first World Cup qualifier match at Estadio Azteca, scoring a brace in the 72nd and 75th minute respectively after trailing 1–0.\n\nHe was called up to play again against Honduras after missing the squad due to injury or call-ups from VfB Stuttgart.\n\nAmérica\n\nVfB Stuttgart\n\nMexico\n\n"}
