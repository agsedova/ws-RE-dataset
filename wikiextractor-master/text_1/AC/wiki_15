{"id": "2066129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066129", "title": "Tulsk", "text": "Tulsk\n\nTulsk () is a village in County Roscommon, Ireland. It lies on the N5 national primary road between Strokestown and Bellanagare. It is 19 km north of Roscommon town.\n\nCruachan may be one of the most important and best preserved Celtic Royal Sites in Europe, and Tulsk is the setting for the interpretative centre which explores this complex and mysterious landscape. Cruachan was an Iron Age (Gaelic) royal palace, the home of the Irish warrior Queen Medb (or Meave), who was responsible for launching the Cattle raid of Cooley, as recounted in one of the best known works of early Irish literature, the Táin Bó Cuailnge.\n\nModern science is shedding new light on the significance of this ancient landscape and the meaning of the 60 National Monuments to be found here. The results of Archaeological Surveys carried out by Prof. John Waddell, from National University of Ireland, Galway, are incorporated into the exhibition rooms at Cruachan Aí Heritage Centre. The book \"Rathcroghan, Co Roscommon: archaeological and geophysical survey in a ritual landscape\", by John Waddell, Joe Fenwick, and Kevin Barton, details significant and previously unknown features and information about the Celtic Royal Site of Connacht.\n\nThe Discovery Programme has based its primary archaeological excavations and survey in the medieval village of Tulsk, and surrounding areas, from 2003 to 2009.\n\nArchaeological research conducted by the Discovery Programme, Ireland’s archaeological research institute funded by the Heritage Council, has been examining the nature of Gaelic lordship and settlement in north Roscommon during the later medieval period, c. 1170-1650 AD. Since 2003, elements of this work have focussed on the history and development of Tulsk, as the principal residence of the O’Conor Roe (Rua) lords. Excavation on the ringfort in Tulsk village continues to reveal a sequence of unexpected and complex settlement horizons, which include a medieval castle-building phase and an Elizabethan-period (c. 1560-90s) occupation, when the mound was included as part of the works associated with the garrisoning of Tulsk by Sir Richard Bingham, the ‘Flail of Connacht’.\n\nIn 2009, the archaeological team has focused on a series of critical strata that explain the dating and development of the site. This year’s work considers the ringfort that underlies the medieval tower. The work shows the impressive boulder clay bank and ditch. It also shows the levels of soil introduced at a later date to build up the rignfort into a ‘platform’ of ‘raised rath’ form, sometime before the building of the medieval tower. The recent excavation has also revealed prehistoric levels, that extend back into the Mesolithic period, before the time of farming and when hunting and gathering prevailed. The sequence of levels reveals the degree to which the medieval lords attached value to returning to known sites of habitation.\n\nStudent volunteers from Ireland and from around the world have continued to contribute to the excavation project. Information on finds are presented in the Cruachan Aí Heritage Centre.\n\nParliamentary borough\nTulsk was previously a parliamentary borough, one of three in County Roscommon from the period 1663 to 1800 and was a constituency represented in the Irish House of Commons. Under the co-monarchs William III of England and Mary II of England Tulsk was first represented in the Commons by William Caulfeild and William Neave in 1692. The year marked what was to be the beginning of an extended period of dominance for the Protestant Ascendancy. One of the two seats was effectively hereditary in the Caulfeild family.\n\nVisit of Gabriel Beranger 1779\nIn 1779 the artist Gabriel Beranger travelled throughout Ireland to paint the 'antiquities’ of Ireland for the Hibernian Antiquarian Society. On his travels he passed through Tulsk and Rathcroghan. He noted that on May Day he witnessed a scene ‘peculiar to this locality’:\nIt was that of ‘driving in all the black cattle from the surrounding plains to the great fort [Rathcroghan Mound], and bleeding them for the benefit of their health, while crowds of country people, having brought turf for firing, sat around and cooked the blood mixed with oaten meal, and when they could be procured, onions or scallions.’\n\nVisit of Samuel Lewis 1837\nIn 1837, Samuel Lewis published a topographical dictionary[21] which included the following contemporary description of Tulsk:\n\n\"TULSK, a post-town (formerly an incorporated market-town and parliamentary borongh), in the parish of OGULLA, barony and county of ROSCOMMON, province of CONNAUGHT, 8 miles (N.) from Roscommon, and 79 ¾ (W. N. W.) from Dublin: the population is returned with the parish. O'Conor Roe erected a castle here in 1406, and during the same century a Dominican monastery was founded either by MacDuil or O'Dowell, or by Phelim, son of Phelim Cleary O'Conor, who was interred here in 1448. The castle was for a long time one of the strongest in the province, and was garrisoned by the Earl of Kildare when he led his forces into this province in 1499.\n\nThe monastery continued to flourish till the reign of Elizabeth, but for some time prior to the dissolution its possessions were usurped by the Corporation of Galway. A Dominican abbey was also founded at Toemonia, near the town, by O'Conor Roe which in the reign of Elizabeth was found to be in the occupation of Franciscans of the third order, on whose suppression it was granted by the Queen to Richard Kyndelinshe. The inhabitants were incorporated by Charles II., in the fourteenth year of his reign, by the designation of the \"Portreeve, Free Burgesses, and Commonalty of the Borough of Tulsk:\" the charter also conferred the elective franchise, with power to hold a court of record and a weekly market.\n\nUnder this charter the corporation consisted of a portreeve, 15 free burgesses, and an indefinite number of freemen, assisted by two serjeants-at-mace and other officers appointed in the usual manner. The portreeve and free burgesses continued to return two members to the Irish parliament till the Union, when the borough was disfranchised. The court of record, which had jurisdiction to the amount of £5, has been long discontinued, and the corporation has become extinct.\n\nThe town has dwindled into an insignificant village, consisting only of a few straggling cottages and one shop. Fairs are held on Easter-Monday and the first Monday in November (O. S.); a constabulary police force is stationed in the village, and petty sessions are held weekly. There are some remains of the ancient abbey, situated in a large cemetery which is still used as a burial-place; and also of the conventual buildings; but the chief feature is a double-arched doorway, divided in the centre by a round pillar, which is of elegant design and in good preservation. The surrounding district is extremely rich and affords luxuriant pasturage\".\nBianconi system\nStarted in 1815 by the Italian immigrant Charles Bianconi the system of horse-drawn \"Bians\" grew from one initial route in Munster to daily travel of over 3,000 miles of road in Leinster, Munster and Connacht. Tulsk was one stop on a route from Ballina to Longford and vice versa. Leaving Ballina each morning at 10 a.m. (circa 1842) a mail coach with passengers would arrive in Tulsk at approx. 6 p.m, taking on average a further hour to reach Strokestown, and reaching Longford at 9 p.m. In the opposite direction a Bianconi car passed through Tulsk at approx. 8.50 each morning. It would then be due to arrive in Ballinagare one hour later. What travelers may have seen is open to question, but this was at a time when Tulsk was particularly ravaged by poverty, and suffered death and emigration on a large scale in subsequent years. For instance, as recorded by Maynooth University Population Change Atlas, what we now know as Tulsk parish had a population of 11,101 in 1841. Ten years later that figure dropped to 6,955. In 1861 Tulsk's population had more than halved from that of the eve of the Famine, with 5,539 persons.\nThe Bianconi system grew less popular in the 1850s when rail service began, but many routes such as this one, continued for some time.\n\nOutdoor Rallies\nCloser in time - at the start of the 20th century - in October 1903 the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party John Redmond held a mass outdoor rally or \"National Meeting\" in Tulsk, for the people of County Roscommon. The party's dominant ideology was legislative independence for the country (Home Rule), with land reform also central to their mandate. On this particular inclement October Sunday, held in a field beside the village; Redmond addressed thousands on these two issues, both on local level and national level agendas. Tulsk was decided as the venue as it was geographically central to the county. Redmond arrived in the afternoon on horse-drawn side car from Roscommon town, where he had spent the previous night, after a train journey from Dublin. The culture of mass meetings in 19th century Ireland had begun with Daniel O'Connell's quest for Catholic emancipation, and between 1880 and 1920 there had been (at least, as recorded) eight to 10 such meetings in Tulsk. At this time (1903) Tulsk parish's population has been recorded at 3,275, having dropped further from the 5,539 recorded in 1861.\n\nWorld War 1\nTulsk was no different from most other British and Irish villages and towns during World War One, in that it contributed to the Allied effort of resisting the Central Powers' threat to European stability. John McGrath, from Tulsk, as published in Ireland's Memorial Records, is registered as a Private in the North Staffordshire Regiment - 12th Battalion - and was killed in action in France on 28 July 1918. His grave, amongst 370, can be viewed at Borre British Cemetery in northern France (grave number 11.F.6). Another WW1 soldier is Mark Phibbs of Corbally, Tulsk. He served in the Leinster Regiment, died of post traumatic stress disorder injuries sustained during battle while in France, and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. Both McGrath and Phibbs are some of between 30,000 and 35,000 Irish who perished in the Great War. Two other men, Henry Armitage and William Garry, were RIC officers in Tulsk during that same war, and went to the front after an outdoor send-off in the village (from contemporaneous newspaper reports). Their fate is unknown, like that of half of the men who died in World War I (over 9 million), scattered as they are beneath the green fields of mainland Europe. The Cenotaph memorial, erected mostly in England and France - out of the ashes of the first global catastrophe of the 20th century - goes some way to remembering these dead. (re. Jay Winter, Lecture 18 - Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning - from Yale Open Courses, European Civilisation, available online).\n\nOn Saturday 29 August 1914 an article appeared in the \"Leitrim Observer\" newspaper reporting on spies appearing in the districts of Roscommon. Along with two suspected Germans arrested on suspicion of \"some evil design\", over Tarmonbarry bridge, the following was also printed:\n\nWar of Independence\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, on 14 November 1920 George Kelly, who was a shop keeper in Tulsk, drove to Roscommon town in his truck to collect goods for his store. His vehicle was apprehended and Kelly was arrested and held in Roscommon. Later that night the same truck made its way to Four Mile House in the possession of RIC officers and members of the Black and Tans. Here, in the townland of Rathconnor, John Conry was marched from his house and shot twice in the head, twice in the chest and once in the stomach. The killing was in reprisal for the Four Mile House ambush, which had occurred three weeks previously. His death was just one in a total of 58 fatalities associated with the Irish revolution in county Roscommon from the years 1917 - 1921 (from 'Counting Terror' by Eunan O'Halpin in 'Terror in Ireland 1916-1923' ed. David Fitzpatrick).\n\nThomas Brady, Intelligence Officer of 2nd Battalion, North Roscommon Brigade stated in the Bureau of Military History that while the RIC barracks in Tulsk had been evacuated in Autumn 1919 - Spring 1920, it wasn't burned to the ground until after Easter 1920, without any trouble; \"We had no trouble in destroying [it].\" The barracks had been a busy one for a rural outpost, and in 1911 had no fewer than 10 RIC officers stationed - this at a time of particular agrarian unrest in the area (albeit with a population of 784 in Tulsk DED at the time, as opposed to 215 in 2002 for instance - NUI Maynooth Irish Population Change Atlas (available online)).\n\nTulsk GAA club was founded in 1970 when St. Brendans, Killina merged with St. Marys, Kilmurray to form one club for the whole parish. A new clubhouse and grounds were opened in 1985 and the playing area extended in 1997. The club has one pitch, a stand and a small training pitch. A second training pitch is located in Lisalway just outside Castleplunket. There is also a handball alley on the grounds. \n\nA camogie team was founded in 2009 and won the Roscommon B final several times since its establishment.\n\nFacilities in the village and surrounding areas include the Tulsk Macra na Feirme hall. This club was established originally in 1948 but in its present incarnation was re-established in 1987 after a lapse of ten years. The hall is also used for the Foroige Club, indoor camogie training, and Tidy Towns meetings. The hall has a stage, bathrooms and a kitchenette. Up until 2009 it was used as the play school. The hall is located on the N5 approximately 200 meters east of the crossroads.\n\nCruachan Aí is an interpretative and community centre for the Rathcroghan Celtic Royal Complex, Roscommon. It is located in the centre of the village.\n\nIrish folk singer Christy Moore, in the title track of his \"Welcome to the Cabaret\" album, describes Tulsk as being like \"hell\". It is widely held that this refers to a gig he played there that ended up with a large brawl. However, the area around Tulsk, within the complex of sites known as Cruachan/Rathcroghan, has long association with Hell, due to the Christian Monks fearful notations on a known entrance to the Celtic 'Otherworld', through the Cave at Cruachan - Oweynagat (, the Cave of the Cats).\n\nTulsk is situated on the N5 and is the halfway point between Dublin and Westport. Bus Éireann runs bus services to other major towns from the village.\n\nRoscommon railway station, Carrick on Shannon railway station and Longford railway station are each a 20km to 30km drive away.\n\n\n"}

The majority of students are New Zealand European, but there are some Māori and Asians. The school caters for students from year 7–13.\n\nThe school is divided into two campuses, known as James Hargest Junior Campus (Year 7–8) and James Hargest Senior Campus (Year 9–13). The campuses are at opposite ends of Layard Street and are separated by about a 20-minute walk (1.5 km).\n\nJames Hargest College is named after Brigadier-General James Hargest.\n\nJames Hargest Junior Campus was formerly known as \"Rosedale Intermediate School\" until it became part of the former James Hargest High School to make James Hargest College as part of the Ministry of Education review of schools in 2004. Other intermediate schools in the city merged with the newly formed James Hargest Junior Campus, increasing the school's roll and stretching resources. Because of this, a new technology block has been built, and several new classrooms have been built since the merge. There are over 25 homeroom classrooms.\nThe subjects in the New Technology Block (known as the Atrium) include Science, Art, Woodwork, Foods & Textiles technology, and an ICT & Media Suite.\n\nThe senior campus covers Years 9-13, and as of 1 July 2019 had 866 enrolled students. The school has a New Zealand $ 2.2 million library, which officially opened in 2004 that also includes the Guidance and Careers Centre, as well as a Library Reading Room and Library Classroom. The library's classroom has desks, computers and an interactive whiteboard, as well as the reading room where students can browse the library's collection of magazines, newspapers and many books. There are also DVD movies available for hire to students.\n\n\nThe \"Hargest Centre\" is a large building at the senior campus. The large gymnasium viewing gallery is popular with students who often go there to watch interclass sports at lunch break. There is a cafeteria at the centre, where students can purchase their lunch, and there are tables for the older students to eat indoors.\n\nDuring the early hours of Thursday 3 January 2013, the C Block was badly damaged by a deliberately lit fire. The block was undergoing major renovations at the time. Fortunately, most of the equipment in the block, such as computers and servers, had been removed months prior to the fire. On 15 January 2013, it was revealed that the fire was deliberately lit by two ex-students of the school. They were sentenced to 3 years, 4 months jail and 3 years, 6 months jail respectively. \n\nSchool sports are popular and well established at Hargest. The school frequently shares inter school sporting competitions with rivals Logan Park High School in Dunedin and Gore High School in Gore.\n\nStudents can partake in a very wide variety of sports to represent the school, and there are often notices for tryouts in provincial sports teams.\n\nEveryone at Hargest is placed into a school house. These are Menzies (green), Watson (blue), Thompson (red) and Hamilton (yellow). Near the beginning of each school year, the four houses compete for points at an athletics competition at Surrey Park Athletics Park, next to Stadium Southland.\n\nOn 24 August 2009, Paul O'Connor, who had been Principal since 1993, announced his resignation from the role due to retirement. He remained principal until the end of 2009.\nOn 5 November 2009, Andy Wood was announced as Paul O'Connor's successor in the role. Wood was principal of Central Southland College in nearby Winton. Wood was also deputy principal of the college from 1982 to 2003. He began in the role in the first term of 2010. In November 2019, Mike Newell was announced as the new principal of the school. He started at the beginning of Term 2, 2020.\n\n"}
{"id": "2066140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066140", "title": "Mondial (motorcycle manufacturer)", "text": "Mondial (motorcycle manufacturer)\n\nFB Mondial is a motorcycle manufacturer, founded in 1929, in Milan, Italy. They are best known for their domination of Motorcycle World Championships between 1949 and 1957. The firm produced some of the most advanced and successful Grand Prix road racers of the time, winning five rider and five manufacturer World Championships in that short period.\n\nFB Mondial was born under the impulse of the Boselli brothers Luigi, Carlo, Ettore and Ada. FB stands for \"Fratelli Boselli\" (. Father of the entrepreneurial brothers was Giuseppe Boselli, a well-respected pilot and co-owner of , a legendary motorcycle company from Bologna.\n\nInitially, a workshop was opened for sales and service of G.D models, but within a few months, it soon became clear that there was a market demand for a cheap and robust motorbike. During his years as a competitive motorcyclist, Count Giuseppe Boselli had met Oreste Drusiani, a well-known engine builder and the pair struck a deal. It was in Oreste's farm in Bologna that FB established its first production site, dedicating itself to the construction of motorbikes.\n\nAfter steady success in their early years, in 1943 FB decided to expand their production capability and buy modern machinery to increase production. Unfortunately they could not put their plan into practice, as on 24 July 1943, a heavy allied bombing struck the Bologna railway station and its surroundings, shaking the farm. The machinery survived, but was commandeered by the military to aid in the war effort, putting production on hold for the duration of the war.\n\nThe collaboration between the Drusiani family and the Boselli family continued at the end of the war period, with the reconstruction of the building, thanks to the enormous economic resources of Boselli, who took over full control of the company. FB effectively relaunched in 1948 as FB Mondial. Mondial found early racing success, winning their first of what would become five World Championships in only their second year of production. During a time when MV Agusta and Ducati produced economy lightweight two-stroke motorcycles, mopeds and scooters, Mondial was more of a \"boutique\" manufacturer, specializing in high-performance, small-displacement motorcycles. Much of the production of each motorcycle was done by hand, which kept output low, with production numbers typically ranging between 1,000 and 2,000 units per year. Mondial were able to continue this success for a number of years, sticking with this methodology. In 1957, Soichiro Honda approached Mondial owner Count Boselli for purchase of a Mondial racebike, with which the firm had just won the 125 cc and 250 cc world titles. Count Boselli gave Mr. Honda a racing Mondial; Honda used this bike as a standard to which he aspired, in order to compete on a world-scale. An original Mondial 125 cc racebike is, still now, the first bike on display when entering Honda's Motegi Collection Hall.\nAfter the 1957 Grand Prix season, many major Italian motorcycle manufacturers including Gilera, Moto Guzzi, and MV Agusta announced that they would pull out of Grand Prix competition citing increasing costs and diminishing sales (MV Agusta later reconsidered and continued racing). Mondial, despite their continued success, decide to join them. This marked the beginning of a decline in popularity and sales for the Italian company, and in 1960, the last all-Mondial motorcycle left the factory. After this, Mondial continued for a while, purchasing engines from proprietary makers. In this hybrid form, motorcycles with Mondial frames and ancillary parts, but non-Mondial engines, were produced by the factory for the next 19 years. However, Mondial stopped production in their entirety in 1979, until their rebirth nearly twenty years later.\n\nIn 1999, the rights to Mondial were purchased by newspaper tycoon Roberto Ziletti. Ziletti was an avid motorcyclist in his youth, and his dream was to own a prestigious motorcycle company. Soon after purchasing the rights, Ziletti's father died, leaving him in charge of the Lastra Group. Mondial started producing superbikes again soon afterward. In 2000 Ziletti asked Honda to supply engines for the new Mondial (the Piega 1000) from their race-winning RC51 superbikes. A deal was supposedly made because Mondial had supplied Soichiro Honda with that 1957 racebike. This was the first time Honda has ever allowed a firm to use its engines for their production vehicles.\n\nMondial's difficulties occurred when Lastra acquired Mitsubishi Corp.'s worldwide graphic arts division, leaving Roberto Ziletti insufficient time to focus on Mondial. He had spent more than 11 million Euros on the company, and after failing to farm Mondial out to a Swiss company, the Arcore factory was placed in the hands of the Monza bankruptcy court in July 2004, with around 35 Mondial Piega 1000s in various states of completion. To place this in perspective, Lastra Group had a turnover exceeding 500 million Euros in 2004.\n\nIn interviews in March 2005 a south Georgia motorcycle dealership, stated that the courts had arranged to sell Mondial to their American firm, Superbike Racing, on 28 February 2005, and that they would continue the marque. However, the Monza courts sold Mondial Moto SPA to another buyer on 27 July 2005: Biemme, another motorcycle firm located in Meda (near Milan) and owned by Piero Caronni (the same man who bought from Rimini bankruptcy court the remains and the production right from Bimota for the then defunct Bimota V Due), renamed itself as GRUPPO MONDIAL S.R.L. and continues offering the Piega 1000s to the market.\n\nIn 2014, friends Count Pierluigi Boselli, owner of the Mondial brand and descendant of the original founders, and Cesare Galli, holder of Pelpi international Italy, started to lay the foundation of a project to revive the company, sketching out the first designs that would in time become the first motorcycle.\n\nCesare Galli was formerly the Technical Director at Fantic Motor, the successful Italian offroad brand. Galli worked there until Fantic shut down in 1996 (it has since been restarted successfully), after winning a hat-trick of World Trials Championships with his designs, as well as successive World and Italian Enduro titles. Galli took over the importation of Kawasaki dirtbikes and ATVs for Italy. In 2002 he founded Pelpi International, European distributor for Taiwanese scooter and minibike manufacturers Aeon and Over.\n\nThrough that first year and all of 2015 the initial design sketches evolved into prototypes then eventually became reality; the HPS 125 and HPS 250 for FB Mondial. The HPS design aims to be a fusion of the classic F.B. Mondial character, with modern technology.\n\nBuilt by Piaggio in China, who also produce vehicles for iconic Italian brands such as Aprilia and Vespa, the new Mondials are effectively Piaggio engines with Mondial's own higher specification design of chassis and styling.\n\nThe firm currently offers four variants to the market. The traditionally styled 'café-racer' HPS, available with a 125cc and 250cc engine, as well as the off-road, sportier styled SMT and SMX models.\n\nWorld Championship 1949 \n\nWorld Championship 1950 \n\nWorld Championship 1951\n\nWorld Championship 1957\nAfter the 1957 Grand Prix season, the major Italian motorcycle manufacturers including Gilera, Moto Guzzi, MV Agusta and Mondial announced that they would pull out of Grand Prix competition citing increasing costs and diminishing sales.\n\n\n1951 Isle of Man TT\n1957 Isle of Man TT\n\n\n"}

Dudley) is a fictional comic book character, originally created for Fawcett Comics, and today owned by DC Comics, who appears in stories about the Marvel Family team of superheroes.\n\nCreated by Otto Binder and Marc Swayze, Uncle Marvel was created primarily as a supporting character of Mary Marvel and first appeared in \"Wow Comics\" #18 in October 1943.\n\nAn old, rotund man named Dudley, Uncle Marvel did not have any real superpowers. He found Mary Batson's good deed ledger which she kept to record her good deeds but had dropped and read it, learning her secret. Claiming to be the uncle of Mary Batson, Mary Marvel's teenage alter-ego, from California, Dudley attempted to con his way into the Marvel Family. The Marvels, possessing the wisdom of Solomon, saw through Dudley's machinations, but since he was, in their opinion such a \"lovable old fraud\", they allowed Dudley to join the team as their manager Uncle Marvel and humored his pretense of having Marvel powers. When asked to make use of his supposed superpowers, Dudley would always complain that his \"shazambago\" was acting up and was interfering with his powers, though the Marvels always knew better.\n\nThough mostly played as comic relief, Dudley plays a key role in \"Marvel Family\" #1 as he tricks the rogue Marvel Black Adam (debuting in that story) into saying the magic word \"Shazam\" and reverting to his mortal self. In \"Mary Marvel\" #7, after Mary stops some thugs, Dudley makes Mary promise not to turn into Mary Marvel until midnight, to show that she is helpless without Mary Marvel. He then sends two men to rob the office, not knowing they are actual criminals who kidnap Mary and try to hold her for ransom. The criminals attempt to force Dudley to write a ransom note, but midnight arrives and Mary transforms into Mary Marvel to stop them.\n\nUncle Marvel continued to appear in the Marvel Family stories through 1948, at which time the character was quietly dropped. He returned to the Marvel Family comics when DC Comics began publishing new stories and reprints under the title \"Shazam!\" in 1973, he was put into suspended animation, along with many other Fawcett characters, explained as an attack gone wrong by the Sivana family. He again takes over Shazam Incorporated. After forty years of appearing in the Marvel Family comics, Uncle Dudley was revamped in 1987 along with the rest of the \"Shazam!\" franchise. In Roy Thomas and Tom Mandrake's four-issue 1987 miniseries \"\", the character became Dudley Batson, an actual blood uncle of young Billy Batson, Captain Marvel's alter-ego.\n\nA second revamped version of Uncle Marvel was introduced in Jerry Ordway's \"Power of Shazam!\" graphic novel in 1994 and a resulting ongoing comic book series of the same name, rendering Thomas and Mandrake's version non-canonical. In Ordway's stories, Dudley H. Dudley is the janitor at Billy Batson's school, who looks out for the homeless boy and inadvertently learns that Billy is also the alter ego of Captain Marvel. This revelation leads Dudley to be involved in a number of Marvel Family adventures, including one story (\"The Power of Shazam!\" #11 and #12) in which Dudley temporarily gains superpowers (and the \"Uncle Marvel\" costume of the original version of the character) thanks to Ibis the Invincible. Dudley continued to appear in \"The Power of Shazam!\" for the duration of the series as a recurring supporting character, often paired with Tawky Tawny, an anthropomorphic tiger friend of Captain Marvel's who becomes Dudley's roommate.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of \"The Power of Shazam!\" in 1999, \"Uncle\" Dudley virtually disappeared from DC Comics publications, save for a short cameo in \"52\" #16 at the wedding of Marvel Family related characters Black Adam and Isis and two brief cameos in Jerry Ordway-illustrated issues of \"Justice Society of America\" in 2009 (Vol. 3, #24 and #28). Uncle Dudley was more prominently featured in the two-issue \"Convergence\" tie-in \"Convergence: Shazam!\" in 2015, as well as a brief cameo in the \"Thunderworld\" issue - issue #4 - of Grant Morrison's miniseries \"The Multiversity\".\n\n\n"}

She was a member of Hashomer Hatzair Zionist-socialist youth movement, and joined that movement's underground, upon the 1939 Nazi German invasion of Poland. Róża often used her Hebrew name, Shoshanah. In the home of Izajasz (Isaiah) Robota at Żydowska 4 Street in Ciechanów was the Perec Library, the most active Jewish cultural society in the city, organizing discussions about the Polish, Jewish and world literature, as well as theatre performances, lectures, and dances.\n\nRoza was transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in a Holocaust train during the liquidation of the Ciechanów Ghetto in 1942. She survived the \"selection\" and was assigned to Auschwitz-II Birkenau labor commando for women, where she got involved in the underground dissemination of news among the prisoners. No one else from her family in Europe is known to have survived. She worked in the clothing depot at the Birkenau \"Effektenlager\" adjacent to Crematorium III of Birkenau, where the bodies of gas chamber victims were burned. She had been recruited by men of the underground whom she knew from her hometown, to smuggle \"Schwarzpulver\" (gunpowder; or dynamite according to other sources) collected by women in the Krupp \"Weichsel\" munitions factory, and then transferring it to a \"Sonderkommando\" man named Wróbel, who was also active in the resistance. This \"schwartzpulver\" was used to manufacture primitive grenades to help blow up the crematorium during the \"Sonderkommando\" revolt. In her work, she was assisted by Hadassa Zlotnicka and Asir-Godel Zilber, both also from Ciechanów, whom Robota apparently enlisted in the resistance. Together with a few other women who worked in the Nazi \"pulverraum\" factory, they were able to obtain, hide, and turn over to the men of the underground no more than one to three teaspoons of the \"schwartzpulver\" compound per day, and not every day. The \"Sonderkommando\" blew up Crematorium III on 6 October 1944.\n\nRobota and three other women – Ala Gertner, Estusia Wajcblum, and Regina Safirsztajn – were arrested by the Gestapo and tortured in the infamous Bloc 23 but they refused to reveal the names of others who participated in the smuggling operation. They were hung on 6 January 1945 – two women at the morning roll-call assembly, two others in the evening. Robota was 23 years old. According to some eyewitness accounts, she and her comrades shouted \"Nekamah\" (\"Vengeance!\"), or \"Be Strong\" to the assembled inmates before they died. Some say they shouted, \"Chazak V'amatz\" – \"Be strong and have courage\", the Biblical phrase that God uses to encourage Joshua after the death of Moses. This is also the motto of Hashomer Hatzair, the youth organization she belonged to.\n\nThe Sonderkommando Revolt caused some 70 fatalities among the SS and kapos, and blew the roof off one crematorium, yet the Nazis knew the advancing Russian Army was very close to liberating the camp. It was clear to the Nazis that all evidence of the war-time atrocities had to be concealed, so the Germans attempted to destroy the other four crematoria themselves.\n\nRoza Robota's memory lives on, in the naming of the Roza Robota Gates at Montefiore Randwick (Sydney, Australia). This initiative was made possible by Sam Spitzer, a resistance fighter during World War II and now a resident of Sydney. He named the gates in honour of his war-time hero, Robota, and his late wife, Margaret. Spitzer's sister was in Auschwitz with Robota.\n\nAt Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, a monument was built to honor Robota and the three other executed women. It stands in a prime location in the garden.\n\n\n"}

The book reprises characters from her 1868-69 two-volume novel \"Little Women\", and acts as a sequel, or the second book in an unofficial \"Little Women\" trilogy. The trilogy ends with Alcott's 1886 novel, \"Jo's Boys\", and How They Turned Out: A Sequel to \"Little Men.\" Alcott's story recounts the life of Jo Bhaer, her husband, and the various children at Plumfield Estate School. Alcott's classic novel has been adapted to a 1934 film, a 1940 film, a television series, and a .\n\nAlcott's novel narrates six months in the life of the students at Plumfield, a school run by German Professor Friedrich and his wife, Mrs. Josephine Bhaer (née March). The idea of the school is first suggested at the very end of Little Women, Part Two, when Jo inherits Plumfield Estate from her late Aunt March.\n\nThe story was originally inspired by the death of Alcott's brother-in-law, which is revealed in one of the last chapters, when a beloved character, John Brooke, from \"Little Women\" dies.\n\nAlcott’s first inspiration for bringing educational ideals into the home and the development of a home-like model into the classroom, stems from her father, \"Amos Bronson Alcott\", “an educational reformer and prominent Transcendentalist.” As a “Transcendentalist visionary,” her father was considered unconventional even among his reform contemporaries. Educational theorists such as \"Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi\", also provided the inspiration for Alcott’s educational methodologies and “stressed the need for the school to be as homelike as possible.\"\n\nAs an educational reformer, Alcott's father believed education, “should simply turn the child’s mind inward to recognize that divinity.” Alcott's father also “believed that the theatrical performance of moral allegories by children would train them in the self-restraint that was the basis of domestic harmony and happiness.\"\n\nBronson Alcott’s appeal to children’s imagination “was part of an effort to harness the child’s imaginative powers to the pursuit of the passionless life.” Alcott incorporates family dramatizations for the children of Plumfield to teach children \"how to control every aspect of their self-expression.”\n\nThe story begins with the arrival of Nat Blake, a shy young orphan who is gifted at playing the violin and telling fibs. Nat narrates the story and introduces each character which features several cameo appearances from characters from the original Little Women novel. There are ten boys attending the school already. Then, Nat comes to Plumfield, followed by his friend Dan. After that, Nan arrives and becomes a companion for Daisy, the only girl. Jo's sons, Rob and Teddy, are younger than the others. Rob, Teddy, Daisy and Nan are not counted among the pupils.\n\nPlumfield is not run by conventional means. All the children have their own gardens and their own pets and are encouraged to experiment with running businesses. Pillow fights are permitted on Saturdays, subject to a time limit. Children are treated as individuals, with a strong emphasis on gently molding their characters.\n\nDaisy Brooke, Meg's daughter, attends Plumfield with her twin brother Demi, but she is somewhat isolated with no other girls her age, until Nan's arrival. Nan is even more of a willful tomboy than Jo was as a teenager, while Daisy is mainly interested in dolls and her own mini kitchen. Daisy’s mini kitchen includes a cast iron child-sized oven which was purchased by Jo's brother-in-law, Uncle Teddy, husband of her youngest sister Amy March. Near the end of the novel, Daisy's father, John, dies quietly one night.\n\nThe other newcomer to Plumfield, Dan, is introduced by Nat. Dan originally decides the other boys are \"molly-coddles\" and leads them in experiments with boxing, fighting, drinking, smoking, profanity, swearing and card games, which results in him being temporarily removed from the school. Dan eventually returns to Plumfield with an injured foot and redeems himself by standing up for Nat when Nat is falsely accused of theft by the other boys. He later becomes a curator of the school's natural history museum.\n\nPersonal relationships are central to the school, and diversity is celebrated. Daisy is deeply attached to her twin brother, to shy Nat, and to tomboy Nan. Nan and Tommy are also close and intend to marry when they grow up. Dan, already friends with Nat, is unexpectedly drawn to the pious Demi and the toddler Teddy. While Franz, Emil, Daisy and John are all related to the Bhaers, they are not treated with favoritism and are encouraged to overcome their faults just the same as the other pupils.\n\nIn the Introduction of Louisa May Alcott: A Biography, author \"Madeleine B. Stern\" states that “Louisa May Alcott was throughout her life a professional author skilled in creation and the re-creation implicit in revision.” Alcott's works borrowed “as source material episodes from her life, her observations, her travels, her experiences, [and] her reading.” Alcott’s legacy remains in her depiction of life and her devotion to family. Her overall work is considered, “neither of Hell nor of Heaven, but of a multitude of stories in a variety of literary genres, ranging from fairy tales to realistic war sketches, from sensation thrillers to domestic sagas.”\n\nCommentaries suggest that “even Little Women and its successors, Little Men and Jo’s Boys, were not immune from critics in hot pursuit of gender relations, power struggles, and sexual politics.” According to Stern’s biography, “in the case of Louisa May Alcott, such interpretations are very tempting, since she herself provided such an intriguing arsenal of ammunition.”\n\nAs an educational reformist, Alcott \"proves to be attuned to what eventually, in the twentieth century, became a solution to this obstacle: differentiation, or the idea that all children need not learn the same things.\" As an example, Alcott’s use of performance and acting in the home creates a “fictional adaptation of her father’s allegorical nursery theater, [where] domestic drama is made an inextricable part of the moral struggles of everyday life.” The Alcott family theatrics “proved a means of establishing peace between them, as Louisa learned to use family theater to curb her frantic demands for personal freedom and bring herself into conformity with her father’s domestic ideal.” Through adaptations of family theater, the characters in Little Men “learn to view themselves as little garden plots growing large crops of patience, perseverance, and good temper.”\n\nIn 1865, Alcott was first encouraged to write a book for girls, including memories of her childhood, and while she was employed as an editor at Merry Museum, a Boston children’s magazine, she began writing the Little Women trilogy which includes \"Little Women\", \"Little Men\", or Life at Plumfield with Jo's Boys, and \"\". Little Men was originally published by Roberts Brothers in 1871, and the first edition included 376 pages and since its original publication, Alcott's work has been published in many formats, languages, and adapted for younger readers. \n\nThe novel centers around \"a diverse and challenging set of students—orphaned boys, the next generation of Marches, physically and mentally challenged children, a motherless girl, children of the merchant class—Alcott comments on the possibilities and limitations of science education for the masses.\"\n\nIn the novel, Alcott “is able to devote her attention to the benefits and risks of science education on an individual basis rather than imagining students in the abstract.” Little Men discusses the gray area in-between where a teacher can “cover the whole ground of human culture—physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual, and practical.”\n\nSoon after the publication of Little Men, educational advocates and reformers alike “embraced these theories too, arguing their applicability to all children but particularly of the poor, who, it was believed, most needed the moral education a homelike school could offer.\" Alcott’s novel, Little Men, addresses two ideals of learning which had previously been separated, home and school. \n\nPlumfield becomes an ideal model of a combined home and school, where Alcott's characters grow into adulthood, and their learning \"outcomes are inflected not only by class and gender but also, most important, by the students' preexisting values and moral leanings.\"\n\n\"Little Men\" was first adapted into film in 1934 starring Erin O'Brien-Moore and Ralph Morgan. Another film followed in 1940 with Kay Francis. In 1998, a Canadian feature starring Mariel Hemingway and Chris Sarandon was released.\n\nIn 1993, an animated television series based on this novel ran in Japan, \"\", and has been translated into several other languages with new cast members to voice the characters. A Canadian television series, \"Little Men\", aired in 1998 to 1999 for two seasons. The plot is somewhat altered and acts more as a continuation of the novel.\n\n\n"}

Both were formed under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme and served under the operational command of the Royal Air Force.\n\n488 (NZ) Squadron was formed on 1 September 1941 at Rongotai, New Zealand under Squadron Leader Wilfred Clouston, a veteran of the Battle of France and Battle of Britain with nine victories to his credit. The squadron was one of several Commonwealth squadrons equipped with Brewster Buffaloes, and arrived at Kallang Airfield Singapore in November 1941, where it took over the Brewsters of No. 67 Squadron RAF. Kallang was shared with a Brewster detachment of the 2-VLG-V of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force, and No. 243 Squadron RAF, in which most of the aircrew were Kiwis.\n\nWhen the Japanese attacked, the squadron was still in training and sorting out difficulties with its machines, including dysfunctional oxygen which prevented high altitude flying, weight difficulties which resulted in armour and machine guns being deleted and high maintenance requirements resulting from Brewster's use of worn out ex-airline engines in manufacturing the aircraft (which had been supplied to No. 67 Squadron in March). There were also problems getting spares and with the peacetime red tape and restricted flying hours laid down by the British High Command in Singapore.\n\nFrequent air battles over Singapore occurred from 12 January 1942, the Japanese pilots being better trained and outnumbering the defenders, but (despite widespread claims of Mitsubishi Zeros being present), with the exception of a few Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa \"Oscars\" most Japanese fighters and many bombers were in no better condition than those of the Royal Air Force's. As the Buffalo squadrons (many manned by New Zealanders and Australians) lost men and machines, several were amalgamated into 488 Squadron. Clouston had presented a plan \"Get Mobile\" to provide daylight air cover off the coast to Admiral Phillip's Force Z, but this was rejected by the Navy.\n\nThe squadron received nine Hawker Hurricanes at the end of January to partially replace the Buffaloes, but by 31 January, losses and the ground situation forced a withdrawal to Palembang, Sumatra and a few days later to Tjililitan airfield, near Batavia, Java, where Dutch East Indies Buffalo squadrons were facing a similarly unequal fight. Clouston handed over command to Squadron Leader MacKenzie and stayed with remaining staff to become a prisoner when Singapore fell.\n\nOn 23 February, the squadron evacuated Tjililitan, to Fremantle in Australia where it disbanded on 2 March, the New Zealand pilots returning home to form the nucleus of No. 14 Squadron RNZAF. Figures for the squadron's achievements in the Far East are difficult to determine, but one notable pilot, Pilot Officer Noel Sharp, who flew a Brewster Buffalo in Singapore, is credited with three victories.\n\n488 Squadron reformed on 25 June 1942 at RAF Church Fenton, Yorkshire, as a night fighter 'intruder' unit equipped with Beaufighters. The squadron aircraft carried the code letters ME.\n\nWhen it switched to a defensive role in August 1943 it re-equipped with de Havilland Mosquitoes. In November 1944 the squadron moved to France, and was based in Belgium and Holland in the closing stages of the war. It disbanded on 26 April 1945.\n\nPossibly the top scoring 488 Squadron Mosquito of the war was NF.Mk.XII MM466, ME-R, which shot down seven enemy aircraft between July 1944 and November 1944, after which the aircraft was passed on to 409 Sqn., with which it shot down another four. In its night fighter incarnation, 488 Squadron flew 2899 sorties, shot down 67 aircraft and, in its intruder role, destroyed 40 trains. Pilots were awarded 5 DFCs, a DSO and an AFC.\n\n488 Squadron was unique in that it was the only \"Article XV\" New Zealand unit to have two distinct and separate roles, in different theatres, during World War Two.\n\nIn December 2010, the new headquarters formed to command the RNZAF units stationed at RNZAF Base Ohakea was named No. 488 Wing RNZAF in honour of No. 488 Squadron. This unit was disbanded in early 2015.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a 19th-century village of millworkers' homes.\n\nOella was founded in 1808 by the Union Manufacturing Company as a working class community for the company's mill workers. It was one of the earliest and most extensive cotton factories in the United States and used water-powered looms as early as 1819.\n\nThe Union Manufacturing Company was motivated by the Embargo Act of 1807 which required Baltimore merchants to manufacture finished goods in the United States rather than England. Stock in the company was issued to fund a series of industrial mills, the largest working with cotton and wool. Child and indigent labor was used reaching 150 employees in 1811. After the War of 1812 ended the embargo, cotton prices fell. A fire at the largest mill on 13 December 1815 took a decade to rebuild and recover from. The Mill rebounded with water driven looms, and expanded to three mill buildings before finally dissolving in 1887 after another drop in textile prices. William J. Dickey of Dickeysville (Gwynns Falls) purchased the mill in 1887, operating it as W.J. Dickey and Sons, naming the mill \"Oella\" after the first woman to spin cotton in America.\n\nThe Oella Historic District includes the village that consists of 19th century workers housing and one late 19th century church. The only known 20th century building is the W.J. Dickey Company Mill constructed in 1919 as a rebuild after a 1918 fire. The plant was eventually used for the city. A drawing from 1812 by Maximilian Godefroy shows most of the stone buildings. The brick houses date from the mid-19th century, while the frame buildings were constructed at the end of the century. The Oella Methodist Church is a simple frame building with a tower on the northeast corner, which has been converted into offices. The Patapsco River continued to provide power to generate electricity until 1972, when Hurricane Agnes flooded the power plant. That same year, the Dickey Company ceased manufacturing.\n\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Also listed on the National Register at Oella are the Ellicott's Mills Historic District and Mount Gilboa Chapel.\n\nOella is along the route of the Trolley Line Number 9 Trail.\n\n\nA park commemorating Benjamin Banneker is located in a stream valley woodland at the former site of Banneker's farm and residence at the eastern edge of the Oella community. The Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks manages the park, which was dedicated on June 9, 1998. The park, which encompasses and contains archaeological sites and extensive nature trails, is the largest original African American historical site in the United States. The primary focus of the park is a museum highlighting Banneker's contributions.\n\nOella is the type locality of the Oella Formation, a Late Proterozoic or early Cambrian schist.\n\n"}

It was a decisive victory for the Tang prince Li Shimin, through which he was able to subdue two rival warlords, Dou Jiande who headed the Xia regime in Hebei, and Wang Shichong, the self-declared emperor of the Zheng dynasty. The battle was fought at the strategically important Hulao Pass, east of Luoyang.\n\nFollowing victories in the west that had established his credentials as a general, in August 620 Li Shimin marched against Wang Shichong. Tang troops blockaded Wang in his capital of Luoyang, while seizing the rest of Henan province. After failing in his efforts to break through the Tang siege, and suffering from ever greater privations, Wang solicited help from Dou Jiande. In April 621, Dou Jiande led a 100,000–120,000 strong army west to confront the Tang. Li Shimin's generals urged him to retreat west and protect the Tang core territory at Shanxi, but doing so would surrender the northeastern plains, at that time the heartland of China, to Dou. Consequently, Li Shimin took a gamble by leading a small force east to occupy the strategic Hulao Pass, while the bulk of his army was left behind continuing the siege of Luoyang. Ensconced in favourable defensive positions, the Tang managed to hold up the Xia advance. A large and heterogeneous army, the Xia lacked the flexibility to either outflank Li Shimin's position or abandon the Luoyang campaign and attack the exposed Tang heartland at Shanxi. As a result, the standoff between the two armies continued for several weeks.\n\nFinally, when he judged the situation ripe, Li Shimin feigned detaching part of his forces north to entice an attack. When Dou took the bait and advanced to the Tang positions in battle order, Li Shimin held back his own troops for several hours, until the troops of Dou Jiande were exhausted from being made to wait in formation under the sun for the entire morning. Once signs of disorder began appearing among them, Li Shimin attacked, breaking the opposing army and capturing Dou Jiande. Subsequently, Wang Shichong, left with no other choice, surrendered Luoyang, both his and Dou Jiande's states were absorbed by the Tang. Dou Jiande was later executed, resulting in some of his followers, led by Liu Heita, raising an unsuccessful rebellion against the Tang. Hulao marked the decisive turning point in the civil wars that followed the collapse of the Sui Dynasty, after which the eventual victory of the Tang was never in doubt.\n\nDuring the later reign of the second emperor of the Sui Dynasty, Yang (), the dynasty's authority began to wane: the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, coupled with natural disasters, caused unrest in the provinces, and military failures eroded the emperor's prestige and legitimacy (\"Mandate of Heaven\") among the provincial governors. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and by the time he realized the gravity of the situation, it was too late: as revolts spread, in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.\n\nLocal governors and magnates rose to claim power in the wake of Yang's withdrawal. Nine major contenders emerged, some claiming the imperial title, others contenting themselves for the time being with the more modest titles of \"Duke\" (\"gōng\") and \"King\" (\"wáng\"). Among the most well-positioned contenders was Li Yuan, Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest (modern Shanxi). A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty, and with a distinguished career behind him, Li Yuan was an obvious candidate for the throne. His province possessed excellent natural defences, a heavily militarized population, and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng (Chang'an) and Luoyang. In autumn 617 Li Yuan and his sons, Li Shimin and Li Jiancheng, led their troops south. In a lightning campaign they defeated the Sui forces that tried to bar their way and, on 9 November, Li Yuan's troops stormed Chang'an. Li Yuan was now firmly placed as a major contender for the imperial throne, and on 16 June 618 he proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nIn a series of campaigns in 618–620 the Tang, led by the talented Li Shimin, managed to eliminate their rivals in the northwest and repel an attack by Liu Wuzhou, who had taken control of Shanxi, but they still had to expand their control to the northeastern plain and the modern provinces of Hebei and Henan, which in the words of historian Howard J. Wechsler, would decide whether the new dynasty \"would remain a regional regime or whether they would succeed in uniting the country under its control\". By early 620, two major regimes had established themselves over this region. Henan was controlled by the Luoyang-based Wang Shichong, a former Sui general who declared himself the first emperor of the Zheng dynasty after defeating another rebel leader, Li Mi, at the Battle of Yanshi and absorbing his army and territories. Hebei was ruled by the one-time bandit leader Dou Jiande, who had risen in revolt against the Sui already in 611. From his base at Mingzhou in south-central Hebei he had expanded his control south towards the Yellow River, claiming the title of \"King of Xia\". Like Wang and the Tang, he too made use of the pre-existing Sui officialdom and administrative apparatus to maintain his realm.\n\nIn 619, Dou defeated the Tang army under Li Yuan's cousin Li Shentong and captured their territories north of the Yellow River, while from Luoyang Wang was a constant threat to the cities of the lower Yellow River that had only recently acknowledged Tang authority. The two men are presented as diametrically different characters in the sources: while Dou was chivalrous and successfully extended his territories by judicious moderation, Wang's arbitrariness and lack of courtesy quickly alienated many of his own supporters, leading two of his most distinguished generals, Qin Shubao and Luo Shixin, to desert him and join the Tang. The Tang began launching raids against Wang, causing morale to drop and many of his men to defect. Wang was forced to take hostages from the families of his own generals to ensure their loyalty, and impose kin punishment for any trespassing. Although up to 30,000 people ended up as virtual prisoners in his palace city in Luoyang, these acts only served to further undermine his regime.\n\nFresh from his crushing victory over Liu Wuzhou in August 620, Li Shimin, with an army of 50,000 men, began his advance from Shanxi towards Luoyang. The strategic aim of the Tang prince was to capture the Yellow River valley up to the sea, thus separating the territories held by rival regimes in the north (i.e., Dou Jiande) from any allies in the south, particularly after Du Fuwei, a rebel leader who controlled the Huai River area, chose to acknowledge Tang authority.\n\nStarting from Shenzhou, Li Shimin's progress was swift, advancing against little resistance as Wang feared to risk an open confrontation and remained behind the walls of Luoyang. By September, Tang troops had begun to establish a ring of fortified camps around the city. Wang's offers of a settlement based on a partition of the empire were rejected by Li Shimin. While both sides skirmished around Luoyang, each trying to protect or prevent the supply convoys coming into the city, Tang detachments had penetrated further south, east, and north, triggering the defection of most of central Henan from Wang's control. By the end of the year, only the distant cities of Xiangyang and Xuzhou remained under Wang's control, but were unable to provide any assistance. The monks of the nearby Shaolin Monastery also sided with Li Shimin, defeating a detachment of Wang's army at Mount Huanyuan and capturing his nephew, Wang Renze.\n\nIsolated in his capital and the territory immediately around it, Wang Shichong was growing desperate and more aggressive, launching two major attempts to break out of the Tang blockade in early 621. Both battles were hard fought, but eventually won by the Tang, largely thanks to the intervention of Li Shimin with his bodyguard of 1,000 heavily armed horsemen. The failure of these attempts meant that the siege became ever closer, with siege engines employed to support daily attacks on the city from all sides. The supply situation in Luoyang grew steadily worse as the siege continued into winter and then spring. By March, people were reportedly sifting through dirt to find traces of food, or ate cakes of rice and mud. No one was spared from the suffering, not even the highest officials; and of the 30,000 prisoners held by Wang in his palace, barely a tenth were left alive. Nevertheless, Wang refused any suggestion of surrender, placing his final hopes on an intervention by Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620.\n\nDuring the siege of Luoyang, Dou Jiande and the Tang had been engaged in negotiations, but these had been inconclusive: Dou could not ignore the threat posed by the Tang, but was as yet unwilling to effect a complete breach, and made some conciliatory gestures such as releasing a Tang princess he had captured in 619. When Wang's pleas arrived at his court, Dou was persuaded by his councillor Liu Bin that the situation presented both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, it would be easy to oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation had become critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang.\n\nThe Tang launched an attack from their bases in Shanxi against Dou's flank, hoping to divert his attention, but in vain. Dou had enough men to strongly garrison his territory, while still mustering a huge force for marching against Li Shimin. The 10th-century \"Old Book of Tang\" and the 11th-century \"Zizhi Tongjian\" put Dou's army at 100,000 strong, while the 8th-century works \"Tongdian\" and \"Taizong zun shi\" (surviving only in fragments), raise it to 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was well within the capabilities of the time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats.\n\nThe approach of the Xia army placed the Tang army at Luoyang in a predicament: with no prospects of reinforcements, and with the loyalty of the recently captured cities in Henan suspect, remaining in place to be caught between Wang's men in Luoyang and Dou's army was a recipe for disaster. The older, more experienced and cautious of Li Shimin's generals suggested that he abandon the siege and retire west to Guanzhong, but the Tang prince refused to heed them, as this would mean abandoning the entirety of eastern China to Dou Jiande. Leaving control of the populous northeastern plain to Dou would strengthen his regime, and allow him to expand south, where Du Fuwei and other Tang clients would be forced to submit. Not only would this mean abandoning the unification of the empire, but would place the Tang regime itself in peril. In what his modern biographer C. P. Fitzgerald called \"the most critical military decision of his life\", Li Shimin opted to confront the Xia army with a part of his forces, while leaving most of his army to maintain the siege of Luoyang. This was a risky gamble, as a defeat would risk eliminating the main Tang army, and opening the path for Dou to capture not only Luoyang, but Shanxi and Chang'an itself.\n\nLeaving the siege of Luoyang in the hands of his younger brother Li Yuanji and the general Qutu Tong, Li Shimin took 3,500 men to the Hulao Pass, some to the east of Luoyang, which he occupied on 22 April. His force was augmented by the garrison of the local town, but his army is unlikely to have exceeded 10,000 men, albeit representing some of the best troops in the Tang army. The Hulao Pass was formed by the ravine of the Sishui River. Lined on both banks by escarpments and steep hills, rising in the south to the Songshang mountains, it possessed major strategic importance, as the east–west road along the Yellow River's south bank crossed it. Fitzgerald, who visited the area himself in the early 20th century, described this \"Chinese Thermopylae\" as follows:\n\nWhen Dou Jiande's army arrived before Hulao, Li Shimin headed a daring raid to raise his own army's morale in the face of such a numerically superior enemy. Taking only 500 horsemen, he crossed the river and advanced towards the Xia camp. Leaving the bulk of this force in ambush, Li Shimin pressed on with only four or five men as escort. When the Xia troops attacked, Li Shimin felled several of them with his precise archery, keeping them at a distance while leading them on into the ambush he had prepared. The Xia lost over 300 men, and a number of higher officers were taken prisoner.\n\nLi Shimin followed up this success by sending a letter to Dou, addressing him as if he were a subject, and demanding that he abandon the region. Dou responded by attacking the walled town of Sishui, but found it and the western heights behind strongly held by the Tang. Dou then encamped his forces at Banzhu, a plain east of the pass. Over the next weeks, he repeatedly marched to Hulao and offered battle. Li Shimin, however, was content to remain in his powerful defensive position from which his numerically inferior force could easily hold the Xia at bay. The Tang prince knew that time worked in his favour, as each day the standoff continued only brought the garrison of Luoyang closer to starvation and surrender, and when this happened he would be able to launch his strike with the entire strength of the Tang army. Furthermore, as time passed, the Xia position too deteriorated. The Xia had to laboriously pull their supply barges upstream, while the Tang were conversely aided by the current; and the very size of the Xia army meant that every passing week the costs of maintaining it in the field exhausted the Xia treasury further.\n\nOther passes were available through the hills near Hulao, but they were smaller and equally defensible; given the size of the Xia army, the only other alternative for Dou would have been to bypass the Tang position entirely, either by crossing the Yellow River to the north or by venturing further south to the Huanyuan Pass. Indeed, one of Dou's civil officials, Ling Jing, suggested a different strategic approach, namely to avoid any engagement with Li Shimin, cross to the northern bank of the Yellow River and strike at the Tang heartland in Shanxi, thereby both weakening the Tang and forcing them to abandon the siege of Luoyang without the Xia incurring any casualties. The plan was supported by Dou's wife, Lady Cao, but was not adopted due to the vehement opposition of the Xia generals. Aside from the natural disregard of the military professionals towards a suggestion from someone whom they regarded as an \"armchair general\", however, this opposition is attributed by some sources to the entreaties and bribery of some Xia generals by Wang Shichong's ambassador, who wished to ensure that Dou remained committed to the relief of Luoyang.\n\nWhatever the true events, military historian David A. Graff opines that logistical concerns played the major role in Dou's decision to stay at Banzhu, as his huge army was utterly dependent on proximity to the Yellow River and its canal network for its supplies. In addition, the heterogeneous nature of the Xia army, containing as it did the forces of various rebel leaders Dou had defeated over the past few years, and whose loyalty was doubtful, prevented Dou from dividing his army and sending various detachments on independent missions.\n\nIn the end, after a month had passed, the Tang prince decided to force a confrontation. Li Shimin's reasons for this move are unknown; Graff suggests that it is \"possible that he believed the morale of Dou's men had deteriorated, and it is very likely that he did not wish to allow the exposed Xia army to withdraw to safety in Hebei after Luoyang had fallen\", or that he was frustrated at Luoyang's unexpectedly long resistance. At the same time, Li Shimin was evidently determined to exploit the opportunity offered by the tactical situation to score a crushing victory against Dou, which would result in the rapid absorption of his domains by the Tang.\n\nTo entice his enemy to accept battle, Li Shimin sent his cavalry to raid Dou's supply lines, and then led a portion of his forces, with 1,000 horses across the Yellow River, giving the appearance that he had detached them to guard against an attack in the direction of Shanxi. During the night, these troops secretly crossed the river again. Dou took the bait, and on the early morning hours of 28 May led a large part of his army against Hulao, deploying his troops for battle along the eastern shore of the Sishui river in challenge to the Tang. Per Li Shimin's plan, the Tang troops did not come forth to deploy for battle; instead they remained in their strong defensive positions in the hills, waiting for the Xia army to tire and begin its withdrawal. Then the Tang, according to Graff, \"would rush out and fall upon the by now demoralized and disorganized Xia army\". This conformed to Li Shimin's usual blueprint, which he had already employed to prevail over Liu Wuzhou and the ruler of eastern Gansu, Xue Rengao: the Tang prince let the enemy advance, stretching their supply lines, and chose a suitable, highly defensible position where to confront them; he avoided a direct confrontation, instead launching raids on his opponent's supply lines, awaiting either signs of weakness or the beginning of a retreat; he then launched an all-out attack aiming at a crushing battlefield success, which he rendered decisive by following it up with a \"relentless cavalry pursuit\", in Graff's words, to exploit it and bring about the collapse of his opponent's entire regime.\n\nIn order to draw the Tang out to the open field, where his superior numbers would carry the day, Dou sent 300 of his cavalry to cross the Sishui stream and provoke Li Shimin to attack. Careful to stick to his plan but also exploit the pretext for a delay offered by Dou, the Tang prince sent only 200 of his horsemen. The duel between the two cavalry forces lasted for some time but proved indecisive, until both sides withdrew to their lines. Apart from this and a minor skirmish between a Xia officer and the Tang general Yuchi Gong, the two armies maintained their standoff from about 08:00 until noon, when the Xia troops began to show signs of thirst and weariness, with soldiers sitting down or breaking formation to fetch water. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this. With the horses from his earlier feint having returned and his cavalry again at full strength, the Tang prince sent 300 horsemen under Yuwen Shiji in a probing attack.\n\nWhen Li Shimin saw that the demoralized and dispersed Xia troops were thrown into confusion from this assault and struggled to put up a cohesive defence, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. The Tang attack was inadvertently aided by Dou, who was holding a council with his officers at the time. With his army buckling, Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley. However, in the spreading confusion, many officers were not able to reach their men in time, while orders issued by the generals often did not arrive in the fighting ranks. Seeing disorder spreading in the Xia army, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin's 18-year-old cousin Li Daoxuan particularly distinguished himself in this stage of the battle, charging through the Xia line until he emerged in their rear, turning round to emerge on the other side, and repeating this feat so many times that at the end of the battle so many arrows stuck out of his armour that the Chinese sources liken his appearance to a porcupine.\n\nThe ensuing battle was bloody, but was decided when Li Shimin and a part of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment, planting the Tang banners in full view of both armies. Possibly coupled with the arrival of the flanking Tang cavalry, this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army: trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs, 3,000 Xia soldiers fell in the field or the subsequent pursuit, but more than 50,000 were taken prisoner, and the rest dispersed in the surrounding countryside. These included Dou Jiande himself, who was wounded, unhorsed and captured while trying to find a way to cross the Yellow River. The rout of the Xia state was complete: only a few hundreds of horsemen reached the Xia capital, and with their ruler captured, any possibility of rallying the remaining Xia forces was gone.\n\nThe Tang victory at Hulao spelled the end for Luoyang too: bereft of any hope of rescue, Wang Shichong surrendered on 4 June, after Li Shimin displayed the captured Dou Jiande and his generals before the city walls. Li Shimin returned to Chang'an, which he entered at the head of a triumphal procession, wearing golden armour, followed by the two captive rivals and their courts, 25 of his own generals, and 10,000 horsemen. Dou's wife and senior officials managed to escape the Xia camp and reach the safety of Hebei, but although some wanted to continue fighting under Dou's adopted son, most, including the influential Qi Shanxing, regarded the outcome of the battle as a sign that the Tang possessed the \"Mandate of Heaven\", the divine right to rule. On 10 June, the Xia formally surrendered to the Tang, with Dou's ally Xu Yuanlang and Wang Shichong's brother Shibian following suit over the next days. In stark contrast to the leniency with which the Tang treated most of their defeated rivals, Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong were soon eliminated: Dou was sent to Chang'an, where he was executed, while Wang was ostensibly allowed to retire in exile in Sichuan, but was killed on his way there.\n\nAccording to David Graff, the battle at Hulao was \"the single most decisive engagement of the civil wars\" that followed the fall of Sui, while C. P. Fitzgerald considers it \"one of the decisive battles in the history of the world\". By defeating Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong, the Tang eliminated their two strongest rivals and brought the vital north-eastern plain under their control, securing an unchallenged ascendancy over all other competing factions and making possible the reunification of China under Tang rule. Tang authority had not yet encompassed all of China and rebellions occurred for a few more years. The most notable of these occurred in late 621, when the former Xia officials in Hebei rose up in reaction to the execution of Dou Jiande, under the leadership of Dou's cavalry commander Liu Heita. Nevertheless, the course the civil war had been decided at Hulao, and the various rebel leaders were overcome one by one; the last, Liang Shidu of Shuofang, was defeated in June 628, marking the end of the civil war.\n\nIn late 629, Li Shimin, by now Emperor of China, ordered the erection of Buddhist monasteries on the sites of seven of the battles he had fought during the civil war. In a gesture that illustrated the emperor's desire to heal the divisions of the conflict, for Hulao he chose the name \"Temple of Equality in Commiseration\".\n\n"}

Terms shall not be implied merely because they appear \"desirable and reasonable\". The case has been widely cited in later cases and is narrowly distinguished.\n\nThe owners of the ship called \"The Moorcock\" contracted for space at a wharf owner's jetty in order to unload \"The Moorcock's\" cargo. While docked, the tide went down to a point where the hull of the ship hit a ridge, causing damage to the ship. The plaintiff argued that the wharfingers were responsible to ensure that his vessel would remain safe while docked. The wharf owners, in their defense, claimed that there were no provisions in the contract to ensure the vessel's safety and that they could not have foreseen the damage caused to the vessel. The issue before the Court was whether there can be any implied warranty given the circumstances. The trial court found that there was an implied warranty.\n\nThe Court held for the ship owner, ruling that there was an implied term that the wharfingers had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the state of the riverbed adjacent to the jetty (not, as often stated, an implied term that the jetty would be a safe place to dock). If the wharfingers had taken such responsibility, then they would have discovered the ridge of rock and would have been under the duty to warn the shipowners of the potential hazard. Failure to warn would have been actionable in tort. Therefore, this very restricted term was sufficient to provide protection to the shipowners as it would have been necessary to give the contracted business efficacy. Bowen LJ stated that any implied warranties must be based on the presumed intentions of the parties. An implied warranty may be read into a contract for reasons of \"business efficacy\", and in order to maintain the presumed intention of the parties. As Bowen LJ said:\n\nBowen LJ looked at the presumed risks of the agreement and who was expected to bear them. The wharfingers were in such a position that they could have discovered there was a risk of damage to the ship, and would have been in the best position to judge the safety of the vessel.\n\n"}

Like many magician superheroes introduced in the Golden Age of Comics, Ibis owes much to the popular comic strip character Mandrake the Magician. A second Ibis, successor of the first, was introduced in 2007.\n\nThe original Ibis first appeared in \"Whiz Comics\" #2 (February 1940), and was created by Bob Kingett. When superheroes declined in popularity in the early 1950s, Ibis and the other Fawcett characters ceased publication. One Ibis story shortly thereafter was reprinted by Charlton Comics.\nThe Fawcett characters were later licensed and eventually bought outright by DC Comics in the 1970s. \nThe second Ibis first appeared in \"Helmet of Fate: Ibis the Invincible\" #1 (January 2007), and was created by Tad Williams and Phil Winslade.\n\nIbis begins his life as Amentep, a prince of ancient Egypt who was in love with the beautiful Princess Taia of Thebes. As a young man, Amentep is given the \"Ibistick\", a talisman of incredible power, by the Egyptian god Thoth, who empowers the talisman after Ibis was overthrown. Amentep's throne is eventually usurped – with the aid of a demonic army conjured up by the evil god Set – by a cruel magician known as the Black Pharaoh. When Taia, who is under the protection of Osiris, refuses to marry him, the Black Pharaoh shoots her with a poisoned arrow. Using his Ibistick, Amentep places his beloved in suspended animation to allow her to heal. He casts a similar spell upon himself, hoping to be present when Taia revives.\n\n4000 years later, the mummy of Amentep returns to life in an American museum in 1940 (this was later revealed to be the work of the wizard Shazam). Now called \"Ibis\", Amentep sets out in search of his beloved, eventually finding her at another museum. Seeking to adjust to this new world, Ibis uses his vast powers to become a crimefighter.\n\nIbis can do almost anything with the power of the Ibistick: build force-fields around cities, transport himself and others, heal or destroy people, bring people back to life or summon spirits, give superhuman powers, and even make objects appear out of thin air. Without the wand however, he is powerless, and this weakness is frequently exploited by his enemies. The Ibistick apparently vibrates in the presence of evil, at one point it even wakes him up. Taia was once shown using the wand to make lightning strike a foe of Ibis, and often uses it at other times. It can be used by anybody, but not to cause harm directly to Ibis, or it will backfire on the user. It cannot be used directly against certain magics.\n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", \"Ibis fights ordinary criminals, an animated and living Sphinx, the Yellow Peril Trug, a spider made man-sized and man-smart by the Ibistick, the superintelligent maimed madman Half-Man, the Dark Spirit (a forgotten god of wickedness), Ruthven the Warlock, and Satan Himself.\"\n\nIbis and Taia next appear in a Justice League/Justice Society crossovers as members of a team referred to as Shazam's Squadron of Justice. These heroes live in a parallel universe on a world called Earth-S. Along with many other Earth-S characters, they were imprisoned in Doctor Sivana's Suspendium globe, but released twenty years later when it drifted near the Sun. Ibis was a member of the Squadron of Justice, organized to defeat King Kull when he paralyzed the Marvels and tried to destroy all three Earths. Ibis helped stop Mr. Atom from destroying the futuristic City of Tomorrow on Earth-One.\n\nAfter the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Ibis and Taia were retconned as part of the Golden Age of the DC Universe, in which Ibis served alongside other wartime heroes in the All-Star Squadron. As noted in \"Starman\" Vol. 2, #40 (March 1998), Ibis tends to operate out of Fawcett City like other heroes, including Bulletman, Minute Man, Spy Smasher and the duo of Mr. Scarlet and Pinky.\n\nIbis was reintroduced in the modern DC Universe in \"The Power of Shazam!\" #11, in which he is resurrected by Mary Marvel and \"Uncle\" Dudley to rescue the wizard Shazam from Hell, where he had been imprisoned by the demoness Blaze. In \"Zatanna\" #1, part of the \"Seven Soldiers\" miniseries, Ibis and Taia presumably perish along with Doctor Thirteen and Timothy Ravenwind at the hands of Gwydion during a seance conducted by Zatanna. The sorceress blames her own shortcomings for their deaths.\n\nIbis had a cameo in \"Infinite Crisis\", in a scene showing the return of the Fawcett superheroes to Earth-S. A modernized version of Ibis appeared in \"52\" #10 as the Egyptian representative in Black Adam's coalition. It is not known if this Ibis is the same character.\n\nAmentep's successor is an Egyptian American boy named Danny Khalifa. Due to his ancient bloodline, Danny is chosen by Amentep to be his successor. He inherits the Ibistick and is thrust into a conflict between ancient Egyptian gods. As Ibis, Danny prevents the helmet of Doctor Fate from falling into the hands of the dark god Set. Danny is assisted by the deity Thoth, who becomes his mentor and frightens away the bullies.\n\nIbis returns to seek his new apprentice's services during the \"Reign in Hell\" miniseries. Tensions between the major demons and the Hell-empowered heroes and villains erupt into a struggle for the control of the Hell dimension. Danny accepts the summons. He is assisted by Black Alice, who offers guidance and covers for his absence on Earth. While in Hell, Black Alice betrays him to ensure her own safety, abandoning him to Neron's forces.\nHe is later seen alive on Earth fighting against Frankenstein after being corrupted by the energy of the Starheart.\n\nIbis the Invincible appeared in:\n\n\n\n"}

The film was shot on location at various settings in Israel including Tel Aviv, the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee.\n\nDuring production, Aames and Cates both decided that the film did not need as much nudity as the script called for. In interviews, Aames and Cates claimed that \"the producer (Lantos) went back to Canada and used somebody else in the shots. They weren't in the version of the film they showed us for approval. When I finally got to see the final print months later, I flipped.\" Lantos responded to this by saying that it was up to himself and the distributor to decide what would be included in the final release, not any of the actors. He furthermore claimed that \"99% of it was what Willie and Phoebe shot.\"\n\nNevertheless, Aames agreed to promote the film because, as he admitted, \"aside from those parts that bother me, it's a damn good film.\" Cates felt differently and refused to have anything to do with promotion, such as screenings and parties. According to Aames, Cates was \"really upset\" by the film.\n\nOn Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 20 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nWriting in \"The Washington Post\", Tom Shales stated that \"Paradise\" \"amounts to 100 minutes of agonizing tedium seasoned with equal parts excruciating embarrassment.\" He also criticized the depiction of the Jackal, describing the character as \"an offensively stereotyped Arab\". Leonard Maltin's annual \"Movie Guide\" book describes it this way: \"Rating: star and a half. Silly \"Blue Lagoon\" ripoff, with Aames and Cates discovering sex while stranded in the desert. Both, however, do look good \"sans\" clothes.\" Upon its release, when reviewed on the show \"Sneak Previews\", Roger Ebert selected it as his \"Dog of the Week,\" the worst film he saw that week, and heavily berated it. In his book \"Reel Bad Arabs\", writer Jack Shaheen criticized \"Paradise\" for its \"particularly degrading\" depiction of an Arab sheikh.\n\nGolden Raspberry Awards\n\n"}

He first became prominent during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui as one of the few Sui generals having success against rebel generals, and during Yang Tong's brief reign, he was able to defeat the rebel general Li Mi and seize Li Mi's territory. After becoming emperor, however, he was unable to withstand military pressure from Tang dynasty forces, forcing him to seek aid from Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia. After Dou was defeated and captured by the Tang general Li Shimin (the later Emperor Taizong), Wang surrendered. Emperor Gaozu of Tang spared him, but the Tang official Dugu Xiude (獨孤修德), whose father Dugu Ji (獨孤機) had been executed by Wang, assassinated him.\n\nWang Shichong's ancestors were surnamed Zhi (支), originally from the Western Regions (\"Xiyu\") and were not ethnic Chinese. After his grandfather Zhi Tuinou (支頹耨) died early, his grandmother married a man named Wang, who also adopted his father Zhi Shou (支收), who thereafter changed his name to Wang. Wang Shou later served as a secretary to the governor of Bian Province (汴州, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). The Book of Sui described Wang as a cunning and skeptical man with curly hair and a jackal-like voice.\n\nWang Shichong himself was said to be studious in his youth, particularly concentrating on military strategies. He was also well-acquainted with laws. He apparently had contributions as a soldier and was gradually promoted. It was said that he was skillful in his application of laws and use of language, such that even when he made suggestions that did not appear to make sense logically, people were unable to refute him.\n\nBy 610, after Zhang Heng (張衡), the supervising official of Emperor Yang's palace at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), fell from Emperor Yang's grace, Wang replaced him. As Emperor Yang frequently visited Jiangdu, Wang was said to be skillful at flattering the emperor as well as decorating the palace in an extravagant manner, bringing favor from the emperor. It was further said that Wang understood that Sui was soon to be in disturbance, and therefore carefully cultivated relationships with brave men. Whenever people were imprisoned, he would often find ways to free them, to gain their gratitude.\n\nIn 613, when the general Yang Xuangan rebelled near the eastern capital Luoyang, agrarian rebels south of the Yangtze River rose as well, with Liu Yuanjin (劉元進) as their leader. Emperor Yang initially sent the generals Tuwan Xu (吐萬緒) and Yu Juluo (魚俱羅) against Liu, but Tuwan and Yu were not able to defeat Liu conclusively. Emperor Yang executed Yu, and Tuwan died in fear. Emperor Yang instead sent Wang, and Wang defeated Liu, killing him. Wang initially promised not to kill Liu's soldiers, and they surrendered, but he slaughtered them after they surrendered. However, Emperor Yang, believing that Wang was a capable general, bestowed even greater favor on him.\n\nIn 614, the major rebel leader Meng Rang (孟讓) advanced south from his home commandery, Qi Commandery (roughly modern Ji'nan, Shandong), advancing to Xuyi (盱眙, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). Wang led his army against Meng and built five fences to block Meng's path, while feigning weakness. Meng, believing Wang to be an incompetent civilian, spread his forces, not only to attack Wang, but also to pillage the area. Wang, catching Meng by surprise, struck back, defeating Meng and forcing him to flee.\n\nIn the fall of 615, Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and much of the Sui court was touring Yanmen Commandery on the northern frontier when it received word from the Chinese princess Yicheng that her husband, Shibi Khan, was launching a surprise attack on the area. They hurried to the commandery seat at present-day Daixian in Shanxi; the Turks besieged it on September 11. The emperor sent out messages of distress, promising promotion and riches to his saviors. Wang launched his army from Jiangdu toward Yanmen Commandery despite the long distance. During the journey, he often wept and was disheveled, stating his fear for the emperor's safety. Because the siege was lifted largely through the treacherous deception of Princess Yicheng, who told her husband that the khaganate had come under attack from the north in his absence, Emperor Yang followed the advice of councilors like Su Wei and gave no rewards and few promotions to the soldiers who had come to his assistance, causing great resentment among the military. Hearing of Wang's great personal distress, however, the emperor believed in his loyalty and promoted him to acting governor of Jiangdu in 616.\n\nAfter the general Yang Yichen defeated and killed the rebel general Ge Qian (格遷), Wang crushed the remainder of Ge's forces, and also those of Lu Mingyue (盧明月). Emperor Yang was impressed with his success and personally awarded him wine.\n\nIn fall 617, with Luoyang under the threat of the rebel leader Li Mi the Duke of Wei, who had captured the large food storages that Emperor Yang had built near Luoyang and begun to starve the Sui defense forces at Luoyang, Emperor Yang, then at Jiangdu, sent Wang Shichong, along with several other generals, Wang Long (王隆), Wei Ji (韋霽), and Wang Bian (王辯), from various locations of the empire, to aid Luoyang. They were under the command of Xue Shixiong (薛世雄), who was ordered to take his forces from Zhuo Commandery (涿郡, roughly modern Beijing) to Luoyang was well. However, Xue was intercepted and defeated by Dou Jiande and forced to return to Zhuo Commandery, and died there, leaving the other generals without a central commander. When Wang Shichong, Wang Bian, and Wei arrived at Luoyang, they stalemated with Li across the Luo River, and Emperor Yang put the Sui forces under Wang Shichong's command. For the next several months, he battled with Li, and while each had victories, the results were generally indecisive, although Wang's forces took the brunt of the losses. Meanwhile, he had hoped that Li and his key general Zhai Rang would eventually have a fallout and that he could use the fallout to his advantage, but in winter 617 Li assassinated Zhai without Wang's being able to take advantage.\n\nIn spring 618, after his forces were reinforced by 70,000 men sent by Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tong the Prince of Yue, who was nominally in command at Luoyang, Wang launched a major attack on Li, but was defeated by Li, allowing Li to then crush the other Sui forces as well. In light of the victory, a number of Sui generals and rebel generals all submitted to Li, requesting Li to take imperial title, but Li declined. Wang retreated to Luoyang, and for a while did not dare to engage Li again.\n\nLater in spring 618, Emperor Yang was killed at Jiangdu in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When the news reached Luoyang, the Sui officials at Luoyang, including Wang, declared Yang Tong emperor. Wang was made one of the heads of the examination bureau (門下省, \"Menxia Sheng\") and created the Duke of Zheng. He and six other officials, Duan Da (段達), Yuan Wendu (元文都), Huangfu Wuyi (皇甫無逸), Lu Chu (盧楚), Guo Wenyi (郭文懿), and Zhao Changwen (趙長文), formed a collective leadership and were known as the \"seven nobles.\"\n\nWith Yuwen leading the elite Xiaoguo Army (驍果) back north toward Luoyang, both the Sui officials at Luoyang and Li were apprehensive of Yuwen's plans. In summer, after Yuan and Lu advocated the plan, Yang Tong entered into a peace agreement with Li, where Li accepted Sui titles and nominally submitted to Yang Tong. Li was subsequently able to repel Yuwen's attacks, and when the news reached Luoyang, the officials were largely pleased—but Wang was not, stating, \"Why are they giving offices and titles to a bandit?\" This drew suspicions from Yuan and Lu that Wang was intending to surrender the city to Yuwen. The \"seven nobles\" thereafter came to suspect each other.\n\nWang began to incite his troops by telling them that they would soon fall into Li's trap, and that if Li received the command over them (as Li was nominally bestowed the office of supreme commander of the armed forces), he would surely slaughter them for having resisted him. When Yuan received news that Wang was doing this, he planned to ambush Wang. However, Duan revealed the plot to Wang, and Wang started a coup himself first, killing Lu and surrounding the palace. Huangfu fled to Chang'an, the capital of Emperor Gaozu of Tang (Li Yuan), a former Sui general who had first nominally supported Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You (Emperor Gong) as emperor, but who had taken the throne himself earlier in 618 to establish Tang Dynasty. At Wang's insistence, Yang Tong surrendered Yuan, who remarked to Yang Tong, \"If I die in the morning, Your Imperial Majesty will die in the evening.\" Yang Tong wept, but still sent Yuan to Wang, who executed Yuan. Wang then met Yang Tong and pledged his loyalty, swearing that all he intended was to save himself and save the empire. Yang Tong took Wang inside the palace to meet Yang Tong's mother Empress Dowager Liu, and Wang swore before her as well. Nevertheless, from this point, all power was in Wang's hands, and Yang Tong himself was powerless. Guo and Zhao were also seized and executed. However, initially Wang continued to be outwardly respectful to the young emperor, while he flattered Empress Dowager Liu by offering to be her adopted son and honoring her with the title of \"Empress Dowager Shenggan\" (聖感皇太后).\n\nUpon hearing of Yuan Wendu's and Lu Chu's deaths, Li Mi broke off of peaceful relations with Yang Tong's regime. However, Li had a low opinion of Wang Shichong, and therefore took few precautions against an attack from Wang. At that time, Li's army lacked clothes, while Wang's army lacked food. Against his initial judgment, Li was persuaded by his secretary Bing Yuanzhen (邴元真), who could benefit from the transactions, to trade food to Wang for clothes. As a result, the people of Luoyang stopped surrendering to Li, and while Li then stopped the transactions, the damage was done. Meanwhile, Li's army was worn out and heavily damaged by wars with Yuwen Huaji's Xiaoguo Army as well. While he had earlier received the submission of Wang's family members—including Wang's brother Wang Shiwei (王世偉) and sons Wang Xuanying (王玄應), Wang Xuanshu (王玄恕), and Wang Xuanqiong (王玄瓊) -- he did not take particular use of them, but only detained them at the city of Yanshi (偃師, in modern Luoyang) with hopes to use them in the future to get Wang Shichong to surrender.\n\nWang took this opportunity to launch a major attack on Li in fall 618. He first defeated Li himself at the Battle of Yanshi (after convincing his army that the spirit of the Duke of Zhou had predicted a victory) and, finding someone whose appearance was similar to Li, used him to declare that Li had been captured, further raising his army's morale. He then attacked and captured Yanshi, not only taking his family members but also the family members of many of Li's generals. He then made another assault on Li—which Li reacted slowly to and could not counter. Bing and Shan Xiongxin surrendered to Wang. Li, after initially considering fleeing to join forces with his general Xu Shiji—a friend of Zhai Rang's, ultimately decided to flee west instead to Tang territory to submit to Emperor Gaozu of Tang. After Li left the region, most of Li's territory surrendered to Yang Tong's regime, as did the major rebel general Zhu Can. (Xu, however, did not, and the area under his control submitted to Tang as well.) The major rebel leader Dou Jiande, who had claimed the title of Prince of Xia, also nominally submitted to Yang Tong.\n\nWang was given the honorific office of \"Taiwei\" (太尉), and he began to gather officials with good reputations onto his staff. Wang encouraged people to offer suggestions, putting three wooden signs before his headquarters, requesting for three types of people to volunteer or to provide suggestions:\n\n\nHowever, it was said that Wang, although he welcomed these suggestions and petitions, actually did not act on them, and that while he used kind words to comfort even the lowest of soldiers, he did little in actions to benefit them. In spring 619, Wang's subordinates Dugu Wudu (獨孤武都), Dugu Wudu's cousin Dugu Ji, Yang Gongshen (楊恭慎), Sun Shixiao (孫師孝), Liu Xiaoyuan (劉孝元), Li Jian (李儉), and Cui Xiaoren (崔孝仁) plotted to surrender Luoyang to Tang troops, but were discovered, and they were all executed.\n\nMeanwhile, during a feast in Yang Tong's palace, Wang suffered from a severe case of food poisoning, and he believed that he was poisoned, and thereafter refused to see Yang Tong again. When Yang Tong, fearing his fate, tried to receive divine blessing by having the palace treasures given to the poor, Wang put soldiers around the palace to stop it. In late spring 619, Wang had Yang Tong create him the Prince of Zheng and grant him the nine bestowments—both ultimate steps before taking the throne. He also had his subordinates openly discuss in public how it would be proper for him to take the throne. In summer 619, he had Duan Da and Yun Dingxing (雲定興) enter the palace to persuade Yang Tong to yield the throne to him, and further sent messengers to Yang Tong to say:\n\nHe then had an edict issued in Yang Tong's name, yielding the throne to him, ending Sui and establishing a new state of Zheng.\n\nWang Shichong made his son Wang Xuanying crown prince and Wang Xuanshu the Prince of Han. He made 19 other relatives his princes, and Yang Tong the former emperor the Duke of Lu. He did not have a fixed office; rather, he worked at several offices in the city, and he was in the habit of receiving personal submissions from the people to show that he was open to suggestions, but the idea backfired as too many people submitted petitions, making him unable to read them all. It was also said that he was overly talkative at imperial meetings, causing them to drag on overly long. Meanwhile, in light of his taking the throne, a number of commanderies that had submitted to Yang Tong submitted to either Tang or Xia, and Dou Jiande formally broke with Wang and took imperial style, albeit not imperial title. Further, after Wang attacked Liyang (黎陽, in modern Hebi, Henan), which Xia had seized from Tang, in winter 619, and Dou retaliated by attacking Yin Prefecture (殷州, roughly modern Xinxiang, Henan), the states became enemies.\n\nA month later, Pei Renji and his son Pei Xingyan (裴行儼), as well as the officials Yuwen Rutong (宇文儒童), Yuwen Wen (宇文溫, Yuwen Rutong's brother), and Cui Deben (崔德本) plotted to kill Wang and restore Yang Tong. The news leaked, and the conspirators were slaughtered, along with their families. Wang Shichong's brother Wang Shiyun (王世惲) the Prince of Qi persuaded Wang Shichong that in order to avoid a repeat of the plot, he needed to put Yang Tong to death. Wang Shichong agreed, and he sent his nephew Wang Renze (王仁則) the Prince of Tang and his servant Liang Bainian (梁百年) to force Yang Tong to drink poison. Yang Tong made one last plea, pointing out that Wang Shichong had previously promised to keep him alive. Liang considered requesting confirmation from Wang Shichong, but Wang Shiyun refused. Yang Tong set sacrifices for the Buddha and prayed, \"May it be that I will no longer again be reborn into an imperial household.\" He drank poison, but initially did not die. Wang Shiyun ordered that he be strangled.\n\nMeanwhile, Zheng and Tang had continuous battles near Luoyang and also to the west and south, with the sides trading victories. In fall 620, Tang's Emperor Gaozu commissioned his son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin with an army to attack Luoyang, and Wang Shichong prepared his own forces to defend and counter. Wang sought to enter into a peace agreement with Li Shimin, but Li Shimin declined, and he captured Zheng cities one by one, either by attacking them or by accepting their surrender. By winter 620, Zheng was in a desperate situation, and Wang Shichong sent messengers to Dou, seeking help from Xia forces. Dou, believing that if Tang destroyed Zheng, his own Xia state would be cornered, agreed, and sought to diplomatically convince Li Shimin to withdraw, but Li Shimin again refused. Meanwhile, in spring 621, Li Shimin put Luoyang under siege. Wang's forces had strong catapults and crossbows, inflicting much casualties on Tang forces, and many Tang generals wished to withdraw. Li Shimin, however, believed that Luoyang would fall soon and therefore refused. Upon hearing that Dou was approaching, he decided to advance east to take up defensive position at the key Hulao Pass in advance of Dou's arrival, leaving a relatively small Tang army, under the command of his brother Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, at Luoyang. Wang, seeing Li Shimin's troop movement but unsure what the situation was, did not attack Li Shimin's rear (as some of Li Shimin's generals feared).\n\nMeanwhile, Dou, against the advice of his strategist Ling Jing (凌敬) and his wife Empress Cao, advanced to Hulao in summer 621. Li Shimin initially refused to engage him, wearing his troops out, and then counterattacked, defeating and capturing him. Li Shimin took the captured Dou and Wang's emissaries Wang Wan (王琬) the Prince of Dai (Wang Shichong's nephew) and Zhangsun Anshi (長孫安世) to Luoyang to display them to Wang Shichong. Wang Shichong, after a conversation with Dou, broke down in tears. He considered fighting his way out of the siege and fleeing to Xiangyang, defended by his nephew Wang Honglie (王弘烈) the Prince of Wei. His generals pointed out that he was dependent on Xia help, and now that Dou had been captured, there was nothing further to be done. Wang therefore exited the city and surrendered to Li Shimin. Li Shimin executed a number of his high level officials, but spared Wang himself, his family, and the rest of the officials.\n\nLi Shimin took Wang Shichong and Dou Jiande back to the Tang capital Chang'an to present them to his father Emperor Gaozu. When Emperor Gaozu met Wang and rebuked him, Wang stated, \"I should be beheaded, but the Prince of Qin had agreed to spare me.\" In fall 621, Emperor Gaozu spared him but demoted him to commoner rank, exiling him and his clan to modern Sichuan, while executing Dou.\n\nMeanwhile, Wang and his family members were awaiting exile, and were detained at the barracks of the capital prefecture, Yong Prefecture (雍州). Dugu Xiude, the son of Dugu Ji, took the opportunity to enter the barracks, claiming that Emperor Gaozu wished to see Wang Shichong. Wang Shichong and his brother Wang Shiyun came out to greet Dugu, and Dugu executed them to avenge his father. Emperor Gaozu only punished Dugu by removing him from his post as the prefect of Ding Prefecture (定州, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). The other members of the Wang clan were exiled, but on their way plotted rebellion, and were all executed.\n\nOf all of the contenders to rule the empire during Sui's disintegration, Wang was one of the most reviled by traditional historians. The Later Jin historian Liu Xu, the lead editor of the \"Old Book of Tang\", commented:\n\n"}

Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance of Greece from 17 June 2011 to 21 March 2012. He is a member of the Hellenic Parliament for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) for the first electoral district of Thessaloniki.\n\nHe is a Professor of Constitutional Law at the Law School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\n\nOn 18 March 2012, Venizelos was elected unopposed to replace George Papandreou as PASOK president and led the party in the May 2012 general election as well as the June 2012 general election.\n\nEvangelos Venizelos was born in Thessaloniki on 1 January 1957. He is unrelated to his famous namesake, Eleftherios Venizelos. He is married to Lila A. Bakatselou and has a daughter. He was an undergraduate at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki from 1974 through 1978 and completed postgraduate studies at Panthéon-Assas University in France. In 1980, he received his PhD in Law from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\n\nBesides his mother tongue Greek, he speaks French and English.\nVenizelos is the author of a number of books, monographs and papers, including most recently \"Agenda 16\" ( in 2007, a collection of writings about the future of the university system in Greece, including some articles previously published on the web. Other writings have dealt with current political issues and the media, foreign policy, and developmental policy. His recent works focus more on political theory and cultural issues. He strongly opposes the clash of civilizations theory, and has written extensively about the Greek \"civilization of civilizations\" (Venizelos, 2001).\n\nAs a student, Venizelos served on the Central Council of the Student Union of the University of Thessaloniki (FEAPT) in 1977, and the National Student Union of Greece (EFEE) in 1975.\n\nVenizelos was elected as a PASOK MP in the Thessaloniki A constituency in the general elections of 1993, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2007 and 2009. He has been a member of the parliamentary committee for the Revision of the Constitution, on which he was spokesman for the majority party in the parliaments elected in 1993, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2007. He was also a member of the Standing Committees on National Defence and Foreign Affairs, on Public Administration, Public Order and Justice and on European Affairs.\n\nIn parliament, Venizelos currently serves on the Special Permanent Committee on Institutions and Transparency and on the Special Permanent Committee on monitoring the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nIn addition to his role in parliament, Venizelos has been serving as member of the Greek delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe since 2016. A member of the Socialists, Democrats and Greens Group, he serves on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights; its Sub-Committee on the implementation of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights; the Committee on Rules of Procedure, Immunities and Institutional Affairs; and Committee on the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nHe has been a member of the PASOK Central Committee since 1990. In the past he was a member of the PASOK Executive Bureau.\n\nVenizelos has held the following government posts:\n\nAfter the legislative elections of 2007, in which PASOK was soundly defeated, Venizelos announced his candidacy for the leadership of the party. In the leadership election, held on 11 November 2007, Venizelos was defeated by incumbent party leader George Papandreou, receiving 38.18% of the vote against 55.91% for Papandreou.\n\nWhen named by Papandreou to the finance and deputy PM positions in June 2011, Venizelos said \"'I am leaving defense today to go to the real battle' to reduce Europe’s biggest debt load – almost 1 1/2 times the size of its economy.\" David Marsh of London and Oxford Capital Markets in \"MarketWatch\" wrote that both \"German parliamentarians who voted solidly earlier this month to involve private-sector creditors in the next bail-out package\", which Angela Merkel has now dropped as a precondition, and \"Greece’s politicians and people, who must bow to further austerity as the price for fresh external support\", were central as \"the stage now shifts to further players in the theatre of Greek affairs.\" And \"[n]obody knows whether the burly new Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos will put in a starring role or turn out merely as a transitory figure.\"\n\nOn 1 June 2019 Venizelos left PASOK and KINAL in protest against the political line of the new leader Fofi Gennimata.\n\nVenizelos was active in the Macedonia naming dispute, when elements in Greece opposed the use of the name \"Macedonia\" by the newly independent neighbouring Republic of Macedonia. Columnist Mark Dragoumis of Athens News opined that, \"[i]n February 1994, as minister of information, [Venizelos] was instrumental in convincing the ailing Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to impose that idiotic 'embargo' on the country later named FYROM.\" Dragoumis maintained that Venizelos' motivation was to gain \"nationalist votes in his Thessaloniki constituency\".\n\nDragoumis also criticised Venizelos for helping pass a law – \"in order to boost [his] popularity among Greek republicans\" – to impose a requirement on King Constantine II, former king of the Hellenes, and his family if they wanted to be granted Greek nationality. The requirement was to submit a declaration that they \"unreservedly respected the 1975 Constitution and accepted and recognised the Hellenic Republic\". The columnist termed it a \"silly precondition – reminiscent of the 'declarations of repentance' that Greek leftists were obliged to sign under pressure during the civil war and after\". Ultimately, the law proved irrelevant once Greece signed the Schengen Agreement allowing the ex-king to travel to Greece via Italy without having to pass through Greek immigration.\n\n"}
{"id": "2066241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066241", "title": "Parent pointer tree", "text": "Parent pointer tree\n\nIn computer science, an in-tree or parent pointer tree is an -ary tree data structure in which each node has a pointer to its parent node, but no pointers to child nodes. When used to implement a set of stacks, the structure is called a spaghetti stack, cactus stack or saguaro stack (after the saguaro, a kind of cactus). Parent pointer trees are also used as disjoint-set data structures.\n\nThe structure can be regarded as a set of singly linked lists that share part of their structure, in particular, their tails. From any node, one can traverse to ancestors of the node, but not to any other node.\n\nA compiler for a language such as C creates a spaghetti stack as it opens and closes symbol tables representing block scopes. When a new block scope is opened, a symbol table is pushed onto a stack. When the closing curly brace is encountered, the scope is closed and the symbol table is popped. But that symbol table is remembered, rather than destroyed. And of course it remembers its higher level \"parent\" symbol table and so on. Thus when the compiler is later performing translations over the abstract syntax tree, for any given expression, it can fetch the symbol table representing that expression's environment and can resolve references to identifiers. If the expression refers to a variable X, it is first sought after in the leaf symbol table representing the inner-most lexical scope, then in the parent and so on.\n\nThe term \"spaghetti stack\" is closely associated with implementations of programming languages that support continuations. Spaghetti stacks are used to implement the actual run-time stack containing variable bindings and other environmental features. When continuations must be supported, a function's local variables cannot be destroyed when that function returns: a saved continuation may later re-enter into that function, and will expect not only the variables there to be intact, but it will also expect the entire stack to be present so the function is able to return again. To resolve this problem, stack frames can be dynamically allocated in a spaghetti stack structure, and simply left behind to be garbage collected when no continuations refer to them any longer. This type of structure also solves both the upward and downward funarg problems, as a result first-class lexical closures are readily implemented in that substrate.\n\nExamples of languages that use spaghetti stacks are:\n\nMainframe computers using the Burroughs Large Systems architecture and running the MCP operating system can spawn multiple tasks within the same program. Since these were originally ALGOL-based systems so have to support nested functions, the result is that task creation results in a fork in the stack, which Burroughs informally described as a \"saguaro stack.\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2066244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066244", "title": "Dental fluorosis", "text": "Dental fluorosis\n\nDental fluorosis is a common disorder, characterized by hypomineralization of tooth enamel caused by ingestion of excessive fluoride during enamel formation.\n\nIt appears as a range of visual changes in enamel causing degrees of intrinsic tooth discoloration, and, in some cases, physical damage to the teeth. The severity of the condition is dependent on the dose, duration, and age of the individual during the exposure. The \"very mild\" (and most common) form of fluorosis, is characterized by small, opaque, \"paper white” areas scattered irregularly over the tooth, covering less than 25% of the tooth surface. In the \"mild\" form of the disease, these mottled patches can involve up to half of the surface area of the teeth. When fluorosis is moderate, all of the surfaces of the teeth are mottled and teeth may be ground down and brown stains frequently \"disfigure\" the teeth. Severe fluorosis is characterized by brown discoloration and discrete or confluent pitting; brown stains are widespread and teeth often present a corroded-looking appearance.\n\nPeople with fluorosis are relatively resistant to dental caries (tooth decay caused by bacteria), although there may be cosmetic concern. In moderate to severe fluorosis, teeth are weakened and suffer permanent physical damage.\n\nThe adequate diagnosis of fluorosis can be diagnosed by visual clinical examination. This requires inspection of dry and clean tooth surfaces under a good lighting. There are individual variations in clinical fluorosis manifestation which are highly dependent on the duration, timing, and dosage of fluoride exposure.There are different classifications to diagnose the severity based on the appearances. The clinical manifestation of mild dental fluorosis is mostly characterised a snow flaking appearance that lack a clear border, opaque, white spots, narrow white lines following the perikymata or patches as the opacities may coalesce with an intact, hard and smooth enamel surface on most of the teeth. With increasing severity, the subsurface enamel, all along the tooth becomes more porous. Enamel may appear yellow/ brown discolouration and/ or many and pitted white-brown lesions that look like cavities. They are often described as “mottled teeth”. Fluorosis does not cause discolouration to the enamel directly, as upon eruption into the mouth, affected permanent teeth are not discoloured yet. In dental enamel, fluorosis causes subsurface porosity or hypomineralizations, which extend toward the dentinal-enamel junction as severity increases. Hence, affected teeth are more susceptible to staining. Due to diffusion of exogenous ions (ex, iron and copper), the stains would develop into the abnormally porous enamel.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for this condition includes:\n\nThe two main classification systems are described below. Others include the tooth surface fluorosis index (Horowitz et al. 1984), which combines Deans index and the TF index; and the fluorosis risk index (Pendrys 1990), which is intended to define the time at which fluoride exposure occurs, and relates fluorosis risk with tooth development stage.\n\nDean's fluorosis index was first published in 1934 by H. Trendley Dean. The index underwent two changes, appearing in its final form in 1942. An individual's fluorosis score is based on the most severe form of fluorosis found on two or more teeth. \nProposed by Thylstrup and Fejerskov in 1978, the TF index represents a logical extension of Dean's index, incorporating modern understanding of the underlying pathology of fluorosis. It scores the spectrum of fluorotic changes in enamel from 0 to 9, allowing more precise definition of mild and severe cases.\n\nDental fluorosis is caused by a higher than normal amount of fluoride ingestion whilst teeth are forming. Primary dentine fluorosis and enamel fluorosis can only happen during tooth formation, so fluoride exposure occurs in childhood. Enamel fluorosis has a white opaque appearance which is due to the surface of the enamel being hypomineralised.\n\nThe most superficial concern in dental fluorosis is aesthetic changes in the permanent dentition (the adult teeth). The period when these teeth are at highest risk of developing fluorosis is between when the child is born up to 6 years old, though there has been some research which proposes that the most crucial course is during the first 2 years of the child's life. From roughly 7 years old thereafter, most children's permanent teeth would have undergone complete development (except their wisdom teeth), and therefore their susceptibility to fluorosis is greatly reduced, or even insignificant, despite the amount of intake of fluoride. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the amount of fluoride exposure, the age of the child, individual response, weight, degree of physical activity, nutrition, and bone growth. Individual susceptibility to fluorosis is also influenced by genetic factors.\n\nMany well-known sources of fluoride may contribute to overexposure including dentifrice/fluoridated mouthrinse (which young children may swallow), excessive ingestion of fluoride toothpaste, bottled waters which are not tested for their fluoride content, inappropriate use of fluoride supplements, ingestion of foods especially imported from other countries, and public water fluoridation. The last of these sources is directly or indirectly responsible for 40% of all fluorosis, but the resulting effect due to water fluoridation is largely and typically aesthetic. Severe cases can be caused by exposure to water that is naturally fluoridated to levels above the recommended levels, or by exposure to other fluoride sources such as brick tea or pollution from high fluoride coal.\n\nDental fluorosis has been growing in the United States concurrent with fluoridation of municipal water supplies, although disproportionately by race. A 2010 CDC report acknowledges an overall incidence of dental fluorosis of 22% from 1986-87 increased to 41% in the early 21st century, with an increase in moderate to severe dental fluorosis from 1% to 4%. The 2011-12 NHANES figures documented another 31% overall increase among American teens since the previous decade, with a total adolescent population impact of 61% afflicted. More than one in five American teens (23%) have moderate to severe dental fluorosis on at least two teeth.\n\nTeeth are the most studied body tissues to examine the impact of fluoride to human health. There are a few possible mechanisms that have been proposed. It is generally believed that the hypomineralization of affected enamel is mainly due to in-situ toxic effects of the fluoride on the ameloblasts in the enamel formation, and not caused by the general effects of fluoride on the calcium metabolism, or by the poisoning effects that suppress the fluoride metabolism. However, despite decades of research and studies, there have yet to be any studies that substantiates the believed mechanism whereby dental fluorosis is a result of alteration in the mineralisation that takes place when fluroide interacts with mineralising tissues.\n\nIn the extra-cellular environment of maturing enamel, an excess of fluoride ions alters the rate at which enamel matrix proteins (amelogenin) are enzymatically broken down and the rate at which the subsequent breakdown products are removed. Fluoride may also indirectly alter the action of protease via a decrease in the availability of free calcium ions in the mineralization environment. This results in the formation of enamel with less mineralization. This hypomineralized enamel has altered optical properties and appears opaque and lusterless relative to normal enamel.\n\nTraditionally severe fluorosis has been described as enamel hypoplasia, however, hypoplasia does not occur as a result of fluorosis. The pits, bands, and loss of areas of enamel seen in severe fluorosis are the result of damage to the severely hypomineralized, brittle and fragile enamel which occurs after they erupt into the mouth.\n\nHydroxyapatite is converted to fluoroapatite in a three step process. Dental fluorosis can be prevented at a population level through defluoridation. It is the downward adjustment of the level of fluoride in drinking water.\n\nDental fluorosis may or may not be of cosmetic concern. In some cases, there may be varying degrees of negative psychosocial effects. The treatment options are:\n\nFluorosis is extremely common, with 41% of adolescents having definite fluorosis, and another 20% \"questionably\" having fluorosis according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control found a 9 percentage point increase in the prevalence of confirmed dental fluorosis in a 1999-2002 study of American children and adolescents than was found in a similar survey from 1986-1987 (from 22.8% in 1986-1987 to 32% in 1999-2002). In addition, the survey provides further evidence that African Americans suffer from higher rates of fluorosis than Caucasian Americans.\n\nThe condition is more prevalent in rural areas where drinking water is derived from shallow wells or hand pumps. It is also more likely to occur in areas where the drinking water has a fluoride content greater than 1 ppm (part per million).\n\nIf the water supply is fluoridated at the level of 1 ppm, one must consume one litre of water in order to take in 1 mg of fluoride. It is thus improbable a person will receive more than the tolerable upper limit from consuming optimally fluoridated water alone.\n\nFluoride consumption can exceed the tolerable upper limit when someone drinks a lot of fluoride-containing water in combination with other fluoride sources, such as swallowing fluoridated toothpaste, consuming food with a high fluoride content, or consuming fluoride supplements. The use of fluoride supplements as a prevention for tooth decay is rare in areas with water fluoridation, but was recommended by many dentists in the UK until the early 1990s. \n\nIn November 2006 the American Dental Association published information stating that water fluoridation is safe, effective and healthy; that enamel fluorosis, usually mild and difficult for anyone except a dental health care professional to see, can result from ingesting more than optimal amounts of fluoride in early childhood; that it is safe to use fluoridated water to mix infant formula; and that the probability of babies developing fluorosis can be reduced by using ready-to-feed infant formula or using water that is either free of fluoride or low in fluoride to prepare powdered or liquid concentrate formula. They go on to say that the way to get the benefits of fluoride but minimize the risk of fluorosis for a child is to get the right amount of fluoride, not too much and not too little. \"Your dentist, pediatrician or family physician can help you determine how to optimize your child’s fluoride intake.\"\n\nDental fluorosis can be prevented by lowering the amount of fluoride intake to below the tolerable upper limit. This can be achieved by consuming de-fluorinated water and improving the general nutritional status of the people.\n\nIn ancient times, Galen describes what is thought to be dental fluorosis. However, it was not until the early 20th century that dental fluorosis became increasingly recognized and scientifically studied.\n\nIn 1901 Eager published the first description of the \"mottled enamel\" of immigrants from a small village near Naples, Italy. He writes that the condition is called \"Denti di Chiaie\" (Chiaie teeth), named after Stefano Chiaie, an Italian professor. In the United States of America, a dentist, Frederick McKay, set up practice in Colorado Springs in 1901 and discovered a high proportion of the residents had stained teeth, locally termed the \"Colorado brown stain\". He took this information to Greene Vardiman Black, a prominent American dentist of the time. After examining specimens of affected enamel, in 1916 Black described the condition as \"[a]n endemic imperfection of the enamel of the teeth, heretofore unknown in the literature of dentistry.\" They made the interesting observation that although the mottled enamel was hypomineralized, and therefore should be more susceptible to decay, this was not the case. Gradually, they became aware of existing and further reports of a similar condition worldwide.\n\nIn 1931, 3 different groups of scientists around the world published their discoveries that this condition was caused by fluoride in drinking water during childhood. The condition then started to become termed \"dental fluorosis\". Through epidemiological studies in the US, Henry Trendley Dean helped to identify a causal link between high concentrations of fluoride in the drinking water and mottled enamel. He also produced a classification system for dental fluorosis that is still used in modern times, Dean's Index. As research continued, the protective effect of fluoride against dental decay was demonstrated.\n"}

At its peak, it numbered around 10,000–15,000 adherents. The movement was severely crippled during the Philippine Revolution after the Philippine Constabulary took over patrols in Samar, when the U.S. military declared the island as \"pacified\".\n\nPulahanes practiced a syncretic religious revival centered mostly on Philippine mythology and Folk Catholicism. Individual beliefs include the anting-antings as well as the revival of the babaylan. Indigenous fighting techniques such as eskrima were also utilized in the elite and ferocious combat style. They practiced a form indigenous martial arts called Derobio Eskrima and they specialize using a heavy, crescent-shaped bolo knife in their battles. Religious rituals using bottles of holy oil, prayer books such as the Bible, consecrated \"anting-anting\", as blessings before battles.\n\nAmericans have described Pulahanes as notorious fighters and are experts in hand-to-hand combat. War cries were also common among their fighters. They have also been described as lacking in strategy due to their high casualty figures in battles such as the Massacre at Dolores. They were the subject of many laws passed during the early American colonial period and have often been accused of banditry. George Curry, Governor of Samar, wrote about the Pulahan in a 1907 report: \"...Pulahanes are nearly all ignorant, superstitious persons, and are easily influenced for good or for evil. It is therefore necessary that they be closely watched and brought under our influence, to the end that within a few years they may no longer have the desire to lead a wild and lawless life. They are not naturally bad people, and I know that they can be reclaimed to civilization if brought under the influences mentioned above. Missionaries are badly needed for these people. They are all naturally religious and a good priest could exercise more influence over them than anyone else. \"\n\nThe 19th century saw the rise of the \"dios-dios\" \"shamans\". \"Dios-dios\" (literally \"god pretender\" or \"false god\", from Spanish \"dios\") were religious leaders so named because of their penchant for identifying themselves with Christian religious figures. They led cult-like religious movements, promising prosperity, supernatural powers, or healing to their followers. Most were mere charlatans selling amulets and magical pieces of paper. Their members were mostly from the illiterate rural poor who had little knowledge of formal Catholic teachings and were living in extreme poverty under colonial rule. The \"dios-dios\" movement was initially purely religious.\n\nThere are numerous examples of \"dios-dios\" leaders in the 19th century. They include Lungao, a healer from Ilocos who claimed he was Jesus Christ in 1811; Ignacio Dimas, who led the \"Tres Cristos\" (\"Three Christs\") of Libmanan, Nueva Cáceres (modern Camarines Sur) who claimed they had supernatural powers over diseases in 1865; Benedicta, an old woman and a healer who called herself \"La Santa de Leyte\" (\"The Saint of Leyte\") in 1862 and prophesied that the island of Leyte would sink; Clara Tarrosa, an eighty-year-old \"babaylan\" in Tigbauan, Iloilo in the late 1880s who proclaimed herself the Virgin Mary and isolated herself and her followers from Spanish rule; Francisco Gonzalez (alias \"Francisco Sales\" or \"Fruto Sales\") of Jaro, Leyte who claimed in 1888 that he was a king sent to save people from another great flood by leading them to a city that would rise from the waves; and many more. These movements were usually suppressed by the Spanish by imprisoning their leaders or exiling them.\n\nThe movement began on 1887, when Ponciano Elofre the \"Cabeza de Barangay\" of Zamboanguita, Negros Oriental, failed to collect all the taxes from his constituents. As a response Spanish soldiers beat his father, Cris Elofre, to death in order to teach him a lesson. Thereafter, he rallied the people against the forced payment of taxes to the Spanish government. His movement would soon incorporate religious freedom, as well as the celebration of the ancient rites of the \"babaylan\" (shaman), with the intention of reviving aspects of Philippine mythology. He renamed himself as Dios Buhawi (literally \"Whirlwind God\") and proclaimed himself the savior of the people. Emulating the ancient \"asog\" shamans, he dressed in women's clothing and assumed feminine mannerisms even though he was married to a woman. He claimed supernatural powers much like the ancient \"dalagangan\". He called his followers \"Pulahanes\", who numbered about 2,000 (whom the Spanish authorities called the \"babaylanes\") and would regularly attack Spanish-controlled towns. Despite its momentum, the movement was unable to achieve its goals. The activities of Elofre so alarmed the Spanish colonial government that Governor-General Valeriano Weyler sent 500 men of the \"Guardia Civil\" and a battleship to Negros to deal with the threat. In August 22, 1887, Elofre raided Siaton, the town adjoining Zamboanguita, and was killed in the encounter with colonial forces. His wife, Flaviana Tubigan, and relatives attempted to continue the movement, but they were eventually captured and exiled by Spanish authorities. They were succeeded by Ka Martin de la Cruz, of Tolong in southern Negros Oriental, Elofre's lieutenant. De la Cruz' command of the \"babaylanes\" degenerated into banditry. When the Spanish authorities failed in their bid to capture him, on September 11, 1893, de la Cruz was killed in a trap laid by his own mistress, Alfonsa Alaidan. The remaining Buhawi followers, were later recruited by Papa Isio when he began to organize his own group of \"babaylanes\" in another revolt against Spain.\nThe last significant \"dios-dios\" rebellion in the 19th century was led by Dionisio Magbuelas, better known as Papa Isio, meaning \"Pope Isio\". Papa Isio was a son of migrants from Panay. By 1880 at 34 years old, he was involved in a scuffle with a Spaniard. Fearing reprisal from the colonial government, he fled to the mountains, where he met Dios Buhawi, leader of the Pulahanes. He joined the Dios Buhawi group. In 1896 Papa Isio organized his own \"babaylanes\" group from remnants of Buhawi's followers, in Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. During his leadership, the movement would become more organized and he led a new revolt beginning in Himamaylan. The movement would continue until the Philippine Revolution in August 1898. During this era, the movement rapidly gained adherents and began setting up base camp on the slopes of Mt. Kanlaon. Soon, they began to have sympathy for the Katipunan, and entered a pact with Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta, leaders of the Katipunan-affiliated Negros Revolution. After the formation of the Republic of Negros in November 1898, tensions began to arise with their new allies. This led to a boiling point when the leaders of this republic signed a treaty with the United States. Papa Isio immediately withdrew his allegiance from this government and began his new offensive. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States after the Spanish–American War, Papa Isio was initially made \"military chief\" of La Castellana, Negros Occidental under the American government. However, he picked up armed resistance again in 1899 during the Philippine–American War. His movement ended on August 6, 1907, when Papa Isio surrendered to American authorities and was sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment and he died in the Manila Bilibid Prison in 1911. \nAnother \"dios-dios\" uprising was led by a shaman named Gregorio Lampinio (better known as \"Gregorio Dios\", and also known as \"Hilario Pablo\" or \"Papa\") in Antique from 1888. The uprising was formed near Mount Balabago, a sacred pilgrimage site for shamans. Lampinio led a force of around 400 people. They collected \"contribuciones babaylanes\" (a revolutionary tax), disseminated anti-colonial ideas, and launched attacks on towns in Antique and Iloilo. The group was eventually suppressed by the Guardia Civil by 1890.\n\nConcurrent with Papa Isio's rebellion in Negros Occidental against American rule, the \"dios-dios\" movement in eastern Visayas turned their attention to the new American colonial government. Calling themselves the Pulajanes (\"those who wear red\"). Like their predecessors, they claimed supernatural powers and used fetishistic amulets, holy oils, and magic spells in battle. They attacked both American troops and local Filipinos cooperating with the American colonial government. James Francis Smith, Governor-General of the Philippines, wrote about the Pulahanes in a 1906 report: \"\"To many the word \"pulahan\" is synonymous with that of bandit or robber. This designation... is hardly proper. The pulahanes of Leyte and Samar can hardly be called robbers or thieves. Indeed, as a rule the pulahan is hard working, industrious, and not at all disposed to violence unless impelled to it by long continued wrongs or by the potent influence of religious fanaticism. All the trouble in Leyte and in Samar was due in a large degree to injustices perpetrated upon the people... Education and just treatment will make out of the pulahan a good citizen\"\"\n\nFrom 1902 to 1907 the Pulahanes challenged the American authorities in Leyte, led by Faustino Ablen (\"Papa Faustino\"), an illiterate peasant who assumed the title of pope. Ablen claimed to have supernatural powers and sold anting-anting that would render one invisible to the enemy and holy oil that could cure any ailment. Ablen promised his followers that after victory, he would lead them to a mountain top on which stood seven churches made of gold, and they would be re-united with dead relatives and lost carabaos. Ablen's troops attacked American forces and captured weapons where they could, however their primary weapon remained the bolo. They would also attack Filipino's who collaborated with the Americans. For example, during the raid on Carigara, they beheaded the local presidente, killed his wife and kidnapped his children. They did not harm innocent locals, their only purpose was to obtain weapons and wreak vengeance on the town police. Despite determined campaigns by the Constabulary, the revolt continued to grow. In some battles, the movement managed to deploy five hundred to one thousand men. The government was so alarmed that it offered a 2000 peso reward for Papa Faustino, dead or alive. US Major General Leonard Wood sent four batallions of the US Army to Leyte to crush the rebellion. This finally broke the rebellion into exceedingly smaller groups that were forced to deploy guerilla tactics. On June 11, 1907, a detachment of Philippine Scouts chanced upon four Pulahan fighters and opened fire. Three men escaped, but one was captured. He was Papa Faustino. With his capture, the rebellion in Leyte came to an end.\n\nAfter Emilio Aguinaldo's surrender to the Americans, the resistance continued in Samar, led by general Vicente Lukbán. The hardships the local population went through by the hands of the US Army, such as the Balangiga massacre of September 28, 1901, instilled a deep hatred for the Americans among the Samareño's. Thus, after Lukban’s secret headquarters along the Cadac-an River was taken over by the Americans on November 17, 1901, several rebel leaders refused to surrender and retreated to the interior of the island, including Lukban who had escaped. Among the rebel leaders were Pablo Bulan (\"Papa Pablo\"), Antonio Anugar, and Pedro de la Cruz. All of them were members of the Dios-Dios. After Lukban was captured on 18 February 1902, Papa Pablo became the leader of the resistance. From 1902 to 1904, Papa Pablo built up his forces in the mountains, which were estimated at 7,000 by 1903. After the Americans brought them the same corrupt officials, new taxes and laws, the local population began to join the Pulahanes and launch attacks on the government.\n\nColonel Enrique Villareal Dagohob (or Daguhob) was a college-educated native of Bicol, who served in the Siege of Catubig on April 1900. He was jailed in his native Masbate from 1902, under the name Andres Villasis (which according to the Philippine Commission was probably his real name), until February 24th 1903. On this day he escaped with five other accomplices. After escaping jail, he went to Leyte and became a prominent military leader, where he was known as Enrique Villareal. In the spring of 1904, he went to Samar under the new pseudonym Dagohob, which means \"strong wind\" or \"thunder\" in the Visayan language. He left Leyte for Samar because of the more favorable war conditions and the strained relations with other Pulahanes. After his arrival, Dagohob set up a base in Catubig in Eastern Samar. After being given a considerable amount of freedom by the Pulahan leaders, perhaps because of his superior education, Dagohob quickly took over the leadership of northeastern Samar and bolstered the Pulahan movement on the island. Dagohob planned to drive the local population into the mountainous interior of the island by the destruction of towns and villages, after which they would be influenced to join the resistance. The government responded by stationing troops and warning the local residents not to leave their settlements. As the Pulahanes had grown too strong for the Constabulary and Philippine Scouts to handle, the US Army relieved the Constabulary forces in December 1904. However, attacks continued and more weapons were captured. The Constabulary forces were then sent into the heart of Pulahan territory. One detachment established a fort at San Ramon, which the Pulahanes soon attacked. The following description of the assault was made: \n\nA devastating battle for the movement was the Battle of Dolores River on 12 December 1904, in Samar, when over 1,000 Pulahanes led by Pedro de la Cruz were massacred by the 38 man contingency of the United States-led Philippine Constabulary. The 38th was ambushed en route, by over 1,000 Pulahanes. As the Pulahanes rushed, waving colorful banners and shouting \"Tad-Tad!\" (Cut To Pieces!) they were met with a volley of rifle-fire that stopped their advance. The Constables held their ground and repelled the attacks, inflicting heavy losses with accurate and steady rifle fire. The Pulahanes were far greater in number, however, and they eventually wiped out the entire scout force. Of the 43 man contingent, the officer and 37 of his men were killed. The Pulajans on the other hand, suffered much heavier losses. Estimates range as high as 300 dead before the Constabulary fell. The pulahan fighters were able to capture 38 Krags rifles, along with a large amount of ammunition. \n\nAfter several captures of guns by the Pulahanes, their force grew stronger, both in firepower and in the boldness of the fighters. By February 1905 the Pulahanes dominated many areas of the island. The government had practically no control of Samar, which was limited to military posts. To make headway, eastern Samar was placed under complete control of the regular army, while the Constabulary retained control over the more peaceful western side. In a surprise attack in July 1905, American troops killed Dagohob, after which many of his followers surrendered and resistance in the area he controlled stopped. In August, Antonio Anugar was also killed. Early in 1906, Nazario Aguillar and 130 of his men agreed to surrender, however this was only a ruse, as during the surrender ceremony they suddenly attacked instead of giving up their arms. It was a suicidal attempt as 43 Pulahanes were killed, but they did kill 22 Constables. In November 1906, de la Cruz was killed in battle and a number of his officers were captured. A few days later, Constables attacked Papa Pablo's camp and killed him. Only one leader of importance remained, Isidro Pompac, also known as Otoy, who assumed control and the title of Papa. By this time, the Pulahanes were much weakened and Otoy roamed from place to place to evade capture. George Curry, Governor of Samar, wrote about the Pulahan in a 1907 report: \"Pulahanism\" has almost ceased to exist in this province (Samar). Otoy, assisted by Angeles and a few others, is in the mountains between Borongan and Basey with some fifty or sixty followers. They have been so closely pressed by the military, constabulary, and volunteers that they have not made an attack on any of the towns or force since November, 1906. Since my last report, Papa Pablo, the religious head of the Pulahanes, Pedro de la Cruz, the fighting leader, Lucente Picardel, and several other leaders have been killed.\" Major J.B. Murphy was senior inspector and leader of the Samar Philippine Constabulary, tasked with capturing Pulahan leadership. Congressman Eugenio Daza and Narciso Abuke served directly under Murphy as Captains, each leading 100 armed men. Major Murphy is credited with killing the religious head, Papa Pablo. Abuke and his men are credited with killing their fighting leader, Pedro de la Cruz and 20 of his men. Four years later on October 1, 1911, a Constabulary force managed to locate Otoy's small band and killed them. This ended the Pulahan resistance. In Samar alone, 7000 Pulahanes had died. \n\n\n"}

He also had his own self-titled comic for three issues published Summer 1941 - Spring 1942.\n\nAlong with other Fawcett characters, he was purchased by DC Comics, and made brief appearances in the \"Shazam!\" comics in 1976, and the \"Power of Shazam!\" comic in 1995 and 1996.\n\nDuring World War II, Jack Weston is an Army private in prime physical condition who dons a patriotic costume and becomes the Minute-Man, a \"One Man Army\" who combats enemy agents. His double identity is known to his superior officer General Milton, who sends the Minute-Man on unsanctioned missions behind enemy lines. Minute-Man serves as a member of a group of local Fawcett City heroes, the Crime Crusaders Club.\n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", \"His nemesis is the femme fatale Illyria, Queen of the Spies, but he also fights rebellious Haitian natives, robot spies, ten foot tall Nazi monsters, the Black Poet, agents of the Black Dragon Society, the evil Toymaker, mad scientists, mummies, vampires, and head hunters.\"\n\nPrior to DC Comics' \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" miniseries, Minute-Man was said to exist on the parallel Earth-S, home of the Fawcett heroes. He makes his first appearance in \"Shazam!\" when he rescues Billy from Mr. Mind and the Rainbow Squad, who have captured and gagged him. Cap feels unable to fight females, so Minute-Man shows him he can do it, inspiring Cap to beat the Squad, and reveal their leader Mr. Wonderful is really his old enemy, the super-intelligent alien worm Mr. Mind.

This method can be considered a combination between configuration interaction (where the molecular orbitals are not varied but the expansion of the wave function) and Hartree–Fock (where there is only one determinant, but the molecular orbitals are varied).\n\nMCSCF wave functions are often used as reference states for multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) or multi-reference perturbation theories like complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT2). These methods can deal with extremely complex chemical situations and, if computing power permits, may be used to reliably calculate molecular ground and excited states if all other methods fail.\n\nFor the simplest single bond, found in the H molecule, molecular orbitals can always be written in terms of two functions χ and χ (which are atomic orbitals with small corrections) located at the two nuclei \"A\" and \"B\":\n\nwhere \"N\" is a normalization constant. The ground-state wavefunction for H at the equilibrium geometry is dominated by the configuration (\"φ\"), which means that the molecular orbital \"φ\" is nearly doubly occupied. The Hartree–Fock (HF) model \"assumes\" that it is doubly occupied, which leads to a total wavefunction\n\nwhere formula_3 is the singlet (\"S\" = 0) spin function for two electrons. The molecular orbitals in this case \"φ\" are taken as sums of 1s atomic orbitals on both atoms, namely \"N\"(1s + 1s). Expanding the above equation into atomic orbitals yields\n\nThis Hartree–Fock model gives a reasonable description of H around the equilibrium geometry about 0.735 Å for the bond length (compared to a 0.746 Å experimental value) and 350 kJ/mol (84 kcal/mol) for the bond energy (experimentally, 432 kJ/mol [103 kcal/mol]). This is typical for the HF model, which usually describes closed-shell systems around their equilibrium geometry quite well. At large separations, however, the terms describing both electrons located at one atom remain, which corresponds to dissociation to H + H, which has a much larger energy than H + H. Therefore, the persisting presence of ionic terms leads to an unphysical solution in this case.\n\nConsequently, the HF model cannot be used to describe dissociation processes with open-shell products. The most straightforward solution to this problem is introducing coefficients in front of the different terms in Ψ:\n\nwhich forms the basis for the valence bond description of chemical bonds. With the coefficients \"C\" and \"C\" varying, the wave function will have the correct form, with \"C\" = 0 for the separated limit, and \"C\" comparable to \"C\" at equilibrium. Such a description, however, uses non-orthogonal basis functions, which complicates its mathematical structure. Instead, multiconfiguration is achieved by using orthogonal molecular orbitals. After introducing an anti-bonding orbital\n\nthe total wave function of H can be written as a linear combination of configurations built from bonding and anti-bonding orbitals:\n\nwhere Φ is the electronic configuration (φ). In this multiconfigurational description of the H chemical bond, \"C\" = 1 and \"C\" = 0 close to equilibrium, and \"C\" will be comparable to \"C\" for large separations.\n\nA particularly important MCSCF approach is the complete active space SCF method (CASSCF), where the linear combination of CSFs includes all that arise from a particular number of electrons in a particular number of orbitals (also known as full-optimized reaction space (FORS-MCSCF)). For example, one might define CASSCF(11,8) for the molecule NO, where the 11 valence electrons are distributed between all configurations that can be constructed from 8 molecular orbitals.\n\nSince the number of CSFs quickly increases with the number of active orbitals, along with the computational cost, it may be desirable to use a smaller set of CSFs. One way to make this selection is to restrict the number of electrons in certain subspaces, done in the restricted active space SCF method (RASSCF). One could, for instance, allow only single and double excitations from some strongly occupied subset of active orbitals, or restrict the number of electrons to at most 2 in another subset of active orbitals.\n\n"}

These properties have a total of about 14,000 slot machines, 350 table games, 2,300 hotel rooms; and three dozen restaurants.\n\nThe company was founded in 1990 by Bernard Goldstein as Kana Corporation.\n\nIn April 1992, it was renamed Anubis II Corporation. In June 1992, it was renamed again to Casino America, Inc. and began trading on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol CSNO. In 1995 it announced a move to trade to the New York Stock Exchange but that did not happen. In September 1998, it became Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. and changed its ticker symbol to \"ISLE.\"\n\nThe company opened its first casino on August 1, 1992 as a publicly traded corporation. Goldstein was known as the \"grandfather of riverboat gaming since he owned the first riverboat casino to sail on the Mississippi River.\n\nGoldstein's first casino operations were in the Quad City area of Iowa and Illinois, where Goldstein operated the riverboats Diamond Lady and the Emerald Lady under the corporate name Steamboat Casino Cruises. The two boats, which sailed from Bettendorf, Iowa on April 1, 1991, were two of the first modern riverboat casinos.\n\nIsle of Capri Casinos opened its first casino in Biloxi, Mississippi in August 1992, and was the first gaming establishment to trade on the NASDAQ.\n\nIn 2000, Isle of Capri spent $400 million in a multi-part deal to acquire the Lady Luck chain of casinos. Lady Luck Gaming, which owned two adjacent Lady Luck casinos in Lula, Mississippi, one in Natchez, Mississippi, the Miss Marquette casino in Marquette, Iowa, and a half interest in the Lady Luck casino in Bettendorf, Iowa, was bought for $59 million in cash, $177 million in assumed debt, and $22 million to redeem preferred stock. On the same day, Isle of Capri bought the other half of the Bettendorf property from Goldstein's family for $62 million, and the rights to the Lady Luck trademark from Lady Luck's founder, Andrew Tompkins, for $31 million. Six months later, it completed the purchase of the Lady Luck Hotel & Casino in downtown Las Vegas from Tompkins for $14.5 million. The Las Vegas property was sold two years later to a group of real estate investors. The other Lady Luck properties were all rebranded under the Isle of Capri name.\n\nIn 2005, its Biloxi casino (but not its hotel) was destroyed and its Lake Charles facilities were damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, respectively.\n\nIn August 2006, Isle of Capri Casinos moved its headquarters from Biloxi to Creve Coeur, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Missouri had offered $4.2 million in tax incentives to lure the operation. 150 employees moved with the headquarters. Company officials said they were looking for new headquarters after evacuating their building three times in 2004–05 due to hurricanes.\n\nOn February 14, 2006, Isle of Capri sold the Isle of Capri Bossier City and Isle of Capri Vicksburg to Legends Gaming for $240 million. The properties are now known as \"Diamond Jack's\".\n\nThe company competed for a gambling license in Pittsburgh in 2006, offering $290 million toward the construction of a new arena for the Pittsburgh Penguins as an incentive and thus drawing enormous public support in Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board nevertheless awarded the license to PITG Gaming Majestic Star instead, who was required to partially fund the building of the new arena, the Consol Energy Center.\n\nOn March 19, 2007 Isle of Capri purchased Casino Aztar in Caruthersville, Missouri from Columbia Sussex for about $45 million.\nIn April, 2007 the Company opened the Isle Casino & Racing at Pompano Park in Pompano Beach, Florida.\n\nOn July 1, 2007 Isle of Capri opened a new property in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nIn 2008, the company adopted a two-brand strategy, reviving the Lady Luck name for smaller properties with limited amenities, while keeping the Isle of Capri name for properties with full-service facilities like hotel rooms, convention space, and expanded dining options. The Marquette and Caruthersville casinos were the first to be rebranded as Lady Luck properties.\n\nIn June 2010, Isle of Capri bought the Rainbow Casino in Vicksburg, Mississippi from Bally Technologies for $80 million. The property was re-branded Lady Luck Casino in 2012.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, the Missouri Gaming Commission awarded the company the state's 13th gaming license for a casino project in Cape Girardeau. The casino includes 1,000 slot machines, 28 table games, 3 restaurants, a lounge and terrace overlooking the Mississippi River and a 750-seat event center at an estimated cost of $125 million.\n\nOn April 14, 2011, Isle of Capri and Nemacolin Woodlands Resort were selected as the recipients of Pennsylvania's last casino resort license by the state's gaming board. Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin is expected to include 600 slot machines, 28 table games, a casual dining restaurant and lounge.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, Isle Casino Cape Girardeau opened to the public.\n\nIn November 2012, Isle of Capri sold the Isle Casino Hotel Biloxi to Landry’s Inc. for $45 million.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin opened to the public.\n\nOn February 3, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its Davenport, Iowa casino to Scott County Casino LLC.\n\nOn October 18, 2015, the Company closed their Natchez, MS riverfront casino due to low patronage. The Isle of Capri hotel was sold to Natchez competitor Magnolia Bluffs Casino.\n\nOn March 13, 2017, the Company sold Lady Luck Marquette to the Casino Queen based in Swansea, Illinois.\n\nOn May 1, 2017, the acquisition by Eldorado Resorts, previously announced on September 19, 2016, was completed.\n\nThe properties owned and operated by Isle of Capri Casinos at the time of its acquisition were:\n\nProperties previously owned by the company include:\n\n"}

Thereafter, he worked locally in the theater in Seattle until he entered the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, where he was eventually assigned to their radio service. He announced re-broadcasts prepared for the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In this role, he served as the announcer for the drama \"Suspense\", dated March 16, 1943.\n\nDuff's most memorable radio role was as Dashiell Hammett's private eye Sam Spade in \"The Adventures of Sam Spade\" (1946–50). With his TV and film career starting to take hold, he ultimately left the program in 1950 at the start of its final season; Stephen Dunne took over the voice role of Spade.\n\nDuff was signed to a long-term contract with Universal, and made his film debut alongside Burt Lancaster as an inmate in 1947's \"Brute Force\". The movie was produced by Mark Hellinger and directed by Jules Dassin, who gave Duff a bigger role in their next film, \"The Naked City\" (1948). He subsequently reunited with Lancaster for the family drama \"All My Sons\" (also 1948), based on the play of the same name by Arthur Miller.\nIn 1951, Duff made a pilot for a new radio series, \"The McCoy\". Following his marriage to Lupino in October 1951, Duff was granted a release from his contract with Universal.\n\nDuff appeared in the 1952 film \"That Kind of Girl\" (aka \"Models Inc\"), and also featured in \"Spaceways\", and \"Roar of the Crowd\" (both 1953), the latter for Monogram Pictures, which ultimately made \"Jennifer\" (also 1953), the second movie in which he starred alongside his wife.\n\nHis other film appearances beside his wife; Don Siegel's \"Private Hell 36\" (1954); Lewis Seiler's \"Women's Prison\" (1955), and Fritz Lang's \"While the City Sleeps\" (1956) continued Duff's successful run of movies during the 1950s.\n\nIn addition to his movie roles, Duff also experienced success in television, with appearances in the 1950s series \"The Star and the Story\", \"Climax!\" and \"Crossroads\". From January 1957 to July 1958, he appeared with Lupino in the CBS sitcom \"Mr. Adams and Eve\", which revolved around the private lives of two fictitious film stars Howard Adams and Eve Drake. They also served as producers.\n\nOther TV roles included an appearance in NBC's western series \"Bonanza\", playing a young Samuel Langhorne Clemens in his early life in the West as a satirical and crusading journalist, in the first season episode \"Enter Mark Twain\". Duff also featured in episodes of numerous TV series during the 1960s including \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Burke's Law\", \"The Eleventh Hour\", \"Mr. Novak\" and \"Batman\" (the latter in an episode entitled \"The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra\", alongside wife Ida Lupino). In 1963 Duff appeared as Ed Frazer on \"The Virginian\" in the episode titled \"A Distant Fury.\" \n\nDuff had the lead role in the short-lived TV series \"Dante\" (which ran for only one season; 1960–61), but found greater success as Detective Sergeant Sam Stone in the ABC police drama \"Felony Squad\" (1966–69). Duff appeared in all 73 episodes of the series during its three season run, alongside his co-stars Dennis Cole and Ben Alexander. He also directed one episode; \"The Deadly Abductors\".\n\nDuff also directed 7 episodes of the 1960s TV sitcom \"Camp Runamuck\".\n\nDuff continued to make guest appearances in TV series during the 1970s including \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"The Rockford Files\" amongst others, and also featured in the TV movies \"A Little Game\" (1971) and \"Snatched\" (1973). In 1971 Duff appeared as Stuart Masters in \"The Men From Shiloh\" (rebranded name for the TV western \"The Virginian\") in the episode titled \"The Town Killer.\"\n\nDuff was part of an ensemble cast in the 1978 comedy film \"A Wedding\", and had a prominent role as the attorney to Dustin Hoffman's character in the Academy Award-winning \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" (1979). In 1980 he played Charles Slade in the 1980 mini series The Dream Merchants\n\nDuff portrayed villain Jules Edwards in Part 1 of the 1981 mini-series \"East of Eden\", and was part of the main cast in the TV series \"Flamingo Road\" (1980–82), appearing in all 38 episodes of the show.\n\nHe continued to make guest appearances in TV series during the 1980s, including \"Charlie's Angels\" (1980) (as bumbling private eye Harrigan in the episode \"Harrigan's Angel\"); \"Murder, She Wrote\" (1984), \"Magnum, P.I.\" (1988) (as Capt. Thomas Magnum, II, the grandfather of main character Thomas Magnum, played by Tom Selleck), and \"Dallas\" (also 1988). Duff also had a recurring role as Paul Galveston during the sixth season of \"Knots Landing\" (1984–85), appearing in 10 episodes. He returned for one more episode in 1990.\n\nAlthough Duff made few film appearances during the 1980s, he did have a prominent role in the 1987 thriller \"No Way Out\", alongside Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman. In 1990, shortly before his death, Duff made his final acting appearances in the TV series \"Midnight Caller\" and \"The Golden Girls\", and the film \"Too Much Sun\".\n\nDuff had a tempestuous relationship with actress Ava Gardner in the late 1940s. In October 1951, he married Ida Lupino.\n\nAfter he was listed in Red Channels as a communist subversive in 1950, he lost his radio work and might have forfeited his entire career had it not been for his marriage. Duff and Lupino had a daughter, Bridget Duff (born April 23, 1952). The couple separated in 1966 but did not divorce until 1984. He subsequently married Judy Jenkinson. Like former wife Lupino, Duff was a staunch Democrat.\n\nDuff died at age 76 of a heart attack on July 8, 1990 in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066285", "title": "Carbodiimide", "text": "Carbodiimide\n\nIn organic chemistry, a carbodiimide is a functional group with the formula RN=C=NR. They are exclusively synthetic. A well known carbodiimide is dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which is used in peptide synthesis. Dialkylcarbodiimides are stable. Some diaryl derivatives tend to convert to dimers and polymers upon standing at room temperature, this mostly occurs with low melting point carbodiimides that are liquid at room temperature. Solid diaryl carbodiimides are stable ,but can slowly undergo hydrolysis in the presence of water overtime.\n\nFrom the perspective of bonding, carbodiimides are isoelectronic with carbon dioxide. Three principal resonance structures describe carbodiimides: \nRelevant to the significance of the polar resonance structures, no carbodiimide has been separated into its optical isomers.\n\nThe N=C=N core is relatively linear and the C-N=C angles approach 120″. In the case of C(NCHPh), the central NCN angle is 170° and the C-N=C angles are within 1° of 126°. The C=N distances are short, near 1.20 Å, characteristic of double bonds. Carbodiimides are chiral, possessing C-symmetry. \n\nThe parent compound, methanediimine (HN=C=NH), is a tautomer of cyanamide.\n\nA classic route to carbodiimides involves dehydrosulfurization of thioureas. A typical reagent is mercuric oxide:\nThis reaction can often be conducted as stated, even though carbodiimides react with water. In some cases, a dehydrating agent is added to the reaction mixture.\n\nThe dehydration of N,N'-dialkylureas gives carbodiimides:\nPhosphorus pentoxide and p-Toluenesulfonyl chloride have been used as a dehydrating agents.\n\nIsocyanates convert to carbodiimides with loss of carbon dioxide:\nThe reaction is catalyzed by phosphine oxides. This reaction is reversible.\n\nCompared to other heteroallenes, carbodiimides are very weak electrophiles and only react with nucleophiles in the presence of catalysts, e.g. acids. In this way, guanidines can be prepared. As weak bases, carbodiimides bind to Lewis acids to give adducts.\n\nCarbodiimides are reagents for the Moffatt oxidation, a protocol for conversion of an alcohol to a carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde). Dimethyl sulfoxide is the other component on this protocol:\nTypically the sulfoxide and diimide are used in excess. The reaction cogenerates dimethyl sulfide and a urea.\n\nIn synthesis, compounds containing the carbodiimide functionality are used as dehydration agents. Specifically they are often used to convert carboxylic acids to amides or esters. Additives, such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole or N-hydroxysuccinimide, are often added to increase yields and decrease side reactions.\n\nPolycarbodiimides can also be used as crosslinkers for aqueous resins, such a polyurethane dispersions or acrylic dispersion. Here the polycarbodiimide reacts with carboxylic acids, which functional groups are often present in such aqueous resins, to form N-acyl urea. The result is that there have formed covalent bonds between the polymer chains, which have thus become crosslinked. \n\nThe formation of an amide using a carbodiimide is straightforward, but with several side reactions complicating the subject. The acid 1 will react with the carbodiimide to produce the key intermediate: the O-acylisourea 2, which can be viewed as a carboxylic ester with an activated leaving group. The O-acylisourea will react with amines to give the desired amide 3 and urea 4.\n\nThe side reaction of the O-acylisourea 2 produce both desired and undesired products. The O-acylisourea 2 can react with an additional carboxylic acid 1 to give an acid anhydride 5, which can react further to give the desired amide 3. The main undesired reaction pathway involves the rearrangement of the O-acylisourea 2 to the stable \"N\"-acylurea 6. The use of solvents with low-dielectric constants such as dichloromethane or chloroform can minimize this side reaction.\n\nDCC (acronym for N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) was one of the first carbodiimides developed as a reagent. It is widely used for amide and ester formation, especially for solid-phase peptide synthesis. DCC has achieved popularity mainly because of its high yielding amide coupling reactions and the fact that it is quite inexpensive.\n\nHowever, DCC does have some serious drawbacks, and its use is often avoided for several reasons:\nFor alternative to DCC in coupling see (Coupling Reagents BOP, DCC) at : http://www.biocis.u-psud.fr/IMG/pdf/Coupling_Reagents.pdf\n\nIn contrast to DCC, DIC (acronym for N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide) is a liquid. Its hydrolysis product N,N'-diisopropylurea is soluble in organic solvents.\n\nEDC is a water-soluble carbodiimide reagent used for a wide range of purposes. Apart from uses related to DCC and DIC, it is also used for various biochemical experiments as a crosslinker or chemical probe.\n\n1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-\"p\"-toluene sulfonate is a carbodiimide developed for the chemical probing of RNA structure in biochemistry.\n"}
{"id": "2066288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066288", "title": "Medal of Honor: Airborne", "text": "Medal of Honor: Airborne\n\nMedal of Honor: Airborne is a World War II first-person shooter video game, developed by EA Los Angeles, and released worldwide on mobile phones in August 2007, on Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in September 2007, and on PlayStation 3 in November 2007. It is the 11th installment of the \"Medal of Honor\" series, and uses a modified version of Unreal Engine 3, In the game's single-player mode, players assume the role of an American paratrooper in the US 82nd Airborne Division who is airdropped with his squadrons and fights against hostile forces across six large missions that take place during the latter half of the European theater of World War II, while in its online multiplayer mode, players can choose to fight as Allied soldiers that parachute into the battlefield, or as Axis soldiers who defend on the ground.\n\nUnlike previous games in the series that employed a linear style of gameplay in its single-player mode, in which the start point and direction is already laid out, \"Airborne\" employs a more nonlinear gameplay style in both modes, in that players can start their game anywhere in the map that they land in and complete the majority of a mission's objectives in any order. The game has received more favorable reviews for the PC and PlayStation 3 versions, than its Xbox 360 version. While the game was planned to have versions made for PlayStation 2, Wii, and Xbox, these were later cancelled, with the first two consoles having \"\" as an exclusive title between them instead.\n\nIn both modes of gameplay, players have access to three different categories of weapons that they can use in battles, either selected before or acquired during a game - Main Weapons, covering rifles, sub-machine guns, auto/assault rifles, shotguns and anti-tank weapons; Side-arms, which have infinite ammo and are mainly used as a back-up when out of ammo for main weapons; and grenades. Traditional game mechanics for the game such as crouching and \"cooking\" grenades, are complemented with the ability to lean out of cover to take shots at enemies, while players may also engage opponents in close combat. Like many games in the \"Medal of Honor\" series, players have a health bar, divided into four units, that begins to deplete when taking damage; if the player avoids taking any damage, the current unit of health being depleted will regenerate in time, but any units lost will require the player to find first aid kits. The HUD allows the player to keep track of what weapon they are using, the amount of ammo they have in it and on hand to reload it with, how many grenades they have, and a compass that keeps track of where allies and enemies are, along with markers indicating which direction a player is being damaged from and where active grenades have landed.\n\nWhat makes \"Airborne\" unique in the series is the ability for players to choose where they land as a paratrooper on the battlefield in both modes. Once a player begins descending onto the map they are fighting on, they can direct where they will begin from, controlling the speed of the descent, thus giving greater flexibility and strategy on how they deal with enemies, with the added ability of being able to kick enemies they land upon.\n\nIn the game's main campaign, players assume the role of a fictional paratrooper working alongside other members of an American airborne division, to complete a series of objectives within each of the campaign's six missions. The player is given a briefing on each mission's initial objectives, as well as a map of where they will be operating, including the location of heavy enemy concentrations (marked red) and safe landing sites (marked green). In this mode of gameplay, players can equip two main weapons, designated as primary and secondary weapons, and chose what loadout they have before beginning a mission from a selection of Allied and Axis weapons; additional weapons can be unlocked by either taking those dropped by enemy soldiers during a mission or reaching later missions where they become available in. During missions, weapons earn experience from killing enemies, with the amount per kill greatly increased from performing headshots, melee and multiple kills. Once a weapon earns enough experience, it receives an upgrade that improves how effective it is for the player, with upgrades ranging from increased damage, a higher rate of fire, and reduced weapon recoil. Each weapon can be upgraded three times, and has its own set of upgrades; once it is fully upgraded, the weapon's icon on the interface changes to reflects its fully upgraded appearance.\n\nWhen descending by parachute into a mission's battlefield, the type of landing the player makes affects the speed at which they can begin to fight - \"Greased\" landings, by moving forward before touching down, allow the player to be ready instantly to fight; \"Flared\" landings allow the player to land safely, but require a little time to be combat-ready; \"Botched\" landings, by coming in too hard, cause the player to be more vulnerable to attack as they recover and become combat-ready. The player can also perform a \"Skill\" drop, by landing safely and in a specific way, at a site designated by a white parachute (i.e. landing through an open doorway); each mission has a set number that the player can find on when on the ground, and which they can attempt at any time when their character is descending down onto a mission's battlefield. Once in a mission, players do not face enemies with randomized appearances and weapons, but rather a predetermined selection of enemy types; while the player faces the weakest kind to begin with, more difficult and challenging opponents are introduced as the game progresses.\n\nEach mission the player undertakes consists of two phases. In the first phase, gameplay is non-linear; in addition to choosing where they wish to land, players can decide the order in which objectives are completed, though they are restricted to landing and moving within the area of the map that is accessible to them. If the player is killed during this phase of a mission, they re-spawn in the air, descending down to the battlefield once more, and can thus take advantage of this to put themselves in a more favourable position to complete an objective. Upon completing the objectives outlined in a mission's briefing, the game's second phase begins and focuses on a more scripted and linear path, with objectives unlocked in sequence and a new area of the map becoming accessible. In this phase, the player no longer can parachute back down to the mission's map, instead re-spawning to the last checkpoint they reached.\n\nIn the game's multiplayer mode, players work as a team, playing as either Allied or Axis soldiers, over six maps - while the game uses three from the single-player mode, along with another that is scaled down in size, the other two maps are original design. In a match, players begin by choosing what main weapon they begin with - rifle, SMG, auto-rifle, sniper and anti-tank - which is denoted by what role they are in (i.e. for SMG, Allies get the Thompson, while Axis get the MP40), and can scavenge a second main weapon during the match. If a player is killed, they can change what weapon they use before they respawn, though lose the second weapon they scavenged. Matches can be set to one of three modes - Airborne Objective (a variation on the \"seize-the-objective\" multiplayer mode), Airborne Team Deathmatch, and Team Deatchmatch - with the airborne-based modes utilising \"Airborne\"s unique paratrooper aspects of gameplay, in which Allied players can land wherever they want on the map being used, including when they respawn, but are vulnerable during their descent as Axis players can shoot them down.\n\nPlayers can acquire access to weapon upgrades, similar to those in single-player, depending on what type of match they undertake - unranked matches grant access to upgrades and allow match's server settings to be optimized per what the player(s) want; ranked matches focus on persistent character development that grant gradual access to upgrades over time.\n\nIn 1943, following training in North Africa, PFC. Boyd Travers learns that the 82nd Airborne Division is to help with the invasion of Italy, beginning with Operation Husky. After nearly being killed by friendly fire from the US Navy, Travers and his squadron land in the village of Adanti, Sicily, where the group assists in neutralising several anti-aircraft nests while combating Italian soldiers, before venturing deeper into the village to find a missing sniper team and aiding his squadron in repelling a German counterattack. Travelling to the Italian mainland, the 82nd take part in Operation Avalanche, eliminating a munitions stockpile, fuel depot, motorpool, and radio equipment at an the Paestum archaeological dig near Naples, with Travers assisting in an assault on a ruined temple housing anti-air guns, destroying them before Allied P-40 fighter bombers arrive and destroy the German artillery located around the dig site.\n\nOne year later, on 6 June 1944, the 82nd take part in Operation Neptune, lending assistance to the American forces preparing to land on Utah Beach as part of Operation Overlord. Working with his squadron, Travers manages to eliminate all potential threats to the invasion force, including a Tiger tank and a series of bunkers, before heading to the shoreline and eliminating German pillboxes that endanger the incoming landing forces. A few months later, Travers and his squadron take part in Operation Market Garden, assisting in the capture of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, while preventing the Germans from destroying the town's bridge with explosives planted on it. Despite a fierce counterattack, including the use of Panzerschreck rocket launchers and Tiger tanks, the 82nd manage to secure the bridge for American Sherman tanks to cross, while Travers receives a promotion to Corporal for his actions.\n\nAfter Market Garden ends in failure for the Allies, Travers transfers to the 17th Airborne Division. In March 1945, his division takes part in Operation Varsity, landing within an industrial complex in Essen, Germany, to destroy its stockpile of munitions and tanks, while shutting down its weapon production facilities. Despite a counter-attack by heavily armored Allgemeine SS troopers wielding MG42s that inflict heavy losses on the Allied troops, Travers manages to overcome the new threat and successfully destroys an armoured ammunition train that arrives at the complex. A few days later, with Operation Varsity proceeding as planned, Travers finds his squadron going deeper into enemy-held territory within Essen, with the task of destroying a massive flak tower that Allied bombers had failed to level. Despite heavy opposition, Travers helps to neutralize key fortifications within the tower, before assisting an engineering unit and detonating charges placed beneath the tower, destroying the structure as the war in Europe begins to enter its final stages.\n\nIn a closing report, Travers' CO comments on how history will remember the sacrifice and courage of the men in the Airborne divisions for what they did during World War II.\n\nDevelopment of \"Airborne\" started in late 2004 when the game designers wanted a new game that would \"really revolutionize the \"Medal of Honor\" scene\". The idea of a paratrooper-based gameplay came up and as such a free-roaming environment was needed, which became the key focus of the game. Each mission starts with a jump and the developers wanted to make the experience as nonlinear as possible, with no starting points and as such the scenario unfolding in a different way each time, as opposed to previous World War II FPS games where there is a set starting and end point.\n\nThe lead designer was Rex Dickson, and the executive producer was Patrick Gilmore, who previously worked on \"Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.\" The development team even had an actual historical advisor, who is an enthusiast on the Airborne forces and weapons of World War II, attempting to ensure historical accuracy and authenticity. Each sound was recorded from hundreds of real World War II-era artifacts including real weapons, tanks, and one of the last remaining airworthy C-47s.\n\nOriginally, the game was going to include pathfinder missions done by soldier Eddie LaPointe that would include more stealth. They would come before Travers' drop. This was later cut as EA wanted to simplify the action and focus on large scale fights with Travers instead. EA signed partnership with Jeep to feature drivable vehicles in the game. This was taken out of the final version as well, because levels were made with cramped spaces and short roads and alleys, so there was no room left to drive.\n\"Airborne\" was developed in close consultation with the \"Medal of Honor\" community, via forums and summits. Certain community leaders who run \"Airborne\" fan-sites were invited to a multiplayer preview summit in July 2007, and many problems were identified that would hamper the game's popularity within the \"MOH\" community, the most important ones being lack of a dedicated server and issues with mouse lag and low frame rate. As a result of the summit, the most critical issues were able to be fixed in time for the game's release, and the other issues in time for the first patch.\n\nA single-player demo was released on August 23, 2007, featuring the first half of Operation Husky.\n\n\"Airborne\" uses a heavily modified Unreal 3 engine. The game's core development was started with EA's acquired Renderware engine, but it made the switch to the Unreal 3 engine in early 2006 which delayed the game by over a year. The engine was specifically designed for DirectX 9 and 10 PCs, PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, and supports many rendering techniques utilized within the graphics capabilities of \"Airborne\", including HDRR, per-pixel lighting and dynamic shadows.\n\nBecause of the non-linear gameplay style of \"Airborne\", the developers had to build an entirely new artificial intelligence system to deal with the many ways the player can interact with or approach the computer-controlled allied and enemy soldiers (NPCs), and for them to react to the situation accordingly. With \"Affordance A.I.\", the characters have an awareness of enemy approach patterns, and also features of the terrain and urban infrastructure that provide a tactical advantage, such as cover, high ground and open doorways. This allows AI characters to take intelligent combat actions based on their surroundings, as opposed to the scripted movements of previous linear FPS games.\n\n\"Airborne\" uses two systems to guide the physical and emotional reactions of the AI characters to what is happening around them. \"E-cap\" (emotion capture) is used to create more human-like emotions on the characters' faces by blending an awareness of their surroundings and other NPCs, for example an AI soldier that started to move forward would jump back for cover if an ally next to him was shot.\n\nMedal of Honor: Airborne Original Soundtrack was released on July 31, 2007. It features the in-game tracks and musical scores of the game, all of which were composed by the award-winning Michael Giacchino, who also composed scores for some of the previous Medal of Honor games, including the main theme for the whole series.\n\nThe first scoring session was held at the Paramount Scoring Stage in Hollywood on April 20, 2006 to score the teaser trailer that would premiere at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in the summer of 2006. A 75-piece orchestra, conducted by Marshall Bowen, performed the music. Eight months later, Giacchino was wrangling a few projects, including Lost and Ratatouille, and it was decided that instead of trying to blast through the writing process and compose all of the music for 2-days of recording, it would be best to focus on one day of recording, and then record the rest of the music in the spring when the game's development had progressed sufficiently.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, Giacchino recorded the first round of cues for the game with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Bros. Four months after that, on March 28, 2007, the final round of music was recorded.\n\nThe \"Airborne\" soundtrack has been said to be based on the Medal of Honor themes of the past, but \"brings a dark uncertainty that communicates the ominous journey of the first US Airborne combat troops\".\n\nThe PC and PlayStation 3 versions received \"favorable\" reviews, while the Xbox 360 version received \"average\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nGameSpot was pretty average on the game, saying, \"The single-player campaign doesn't get cooking until the last two levels, but those two levels combined with solid multiplayer make it worth enlisting in \"Airborne\".\" IGN fared a bit better on the game in its review, saying that, \"\"Airborne\", while not perfect, is definitely the best game in the franchise to come along in quite a while.\" Press Start Online stated that \"Airborne\" was \"a \"Medal of Honor\" game that's not only good, it demonstrates a level of imagination and innovation that's becoming increasingly rare in the genre.\" Most reviewers praised the music from the games of \"Medal of Honor\", with IGN stating in particular that the title music was said to bring back some classic memories from \"Allied Assault\" and the starting music for Operation Market Garden for Campaign.\n\n"}

Beck, he first appeared in \"Captain Marvel Adventures\" #8 (March 6, 1942).\n\nIbac's alter-ego is Stanley \"Stinky\" Printwhistle, a crook who attempts to blow up a bridge, but is caught in the explosion and thrown off due to Captain Marvel. He is saved by Lucifer, who offers Printwhistle the chance to become a champion of evil and defeat Captain Marvel in exchange for his mortal soul. Printwhistle accepts, Lucifer summons up four historical villains, and Printwhistle is told to speak the magic word \"IBAC\". By doing so, the frail, grey-haired criminal transforms into Ibac, a brutal muscleman with a buzz cut. Saying \"IBAC\" again transforms Ibac back into Printwhistle.\n\nWhen he first appears he is defeated when Captain Marvel hits him so hard he seems to knock the evil power from him, in the form of leaving Printwhistle and the four other villains in front of him, the four fade away quietly, but Ibac later returns when the evil spirits contact him. Captain Marvel whirls Ibac around so fast that the four evil spirits separate from him. Because he has not been able to defeat Captain Marvel, Printwhistle has not been obliged to give his soul to the devil, and has reformed, but being weak-willed, he has often been forced by other criminals into becoming the evil Ibac again. \n\nIn his first Silver Age appearance in \"Shazam\" #4 (July 1973), the spirits of the villains who gave him his powers telepathically communicate with him, and force him to become Ibac as he has reformed and been a street sweeper for the last ten years. They order him to capture, then destroy, Billy. He succeeds in surprising, capturing, and leaving a bound and gagged Billy in a building about to be blown up, but Billy is able to use a recording of his voice to summon Captain Marvel and beat up Ibac. After being defeated, his benefactors withdraw their powers from him. However this may not be possible Post-Crisis. Ibac was a member of both the Pre-Crisis Monster Society of Evil during WW II, in which he nearly killed Billy in Africa after giving him bound and gagged to cannibals, and the Society formed years later.\n\nWhile Captain Marvel is empowered by six mythological and Biblical figures, Ibac is empowered by four of the most evil and terrifying men to have ever walked the earth: Ivan the Terrible, who supplies Terror, Cesare Borgia, who gives Ibac Cunning, Attila the Hun, who gifts him with Fierceness, and Caligula, the sponsor of Cruelty. While Captain Marvel transforms using magic lightning bolts, Ibac's transformations are accomplished with the power of mystical green fire and brimstone. This also gives him superhuman strength and stamina. In his second appearance in Captain Marvel Adventures #9 Beautia Sivana saying 'Ibac' next to Ibac after his transformation transforms her into a black haired woman wearing a black dress, though she still has her own personality and turns back when saying 'Ibac' again. In Justice League of America #135 (October 1976) Ibac is one of the villains of three Earths working for King Kull. Spy Smasher battles Ibac, and is on the verge of losing when he remembers what Captain Marvel told him of the villain. Spy Smasher then taunts the dim-witted villain, telling him to \"back down\". Ibac responds proudly: \"I back down for nobody!\" The phoenetic \"I back\" causes him to revert to Stinky Printwhistle's form. In \"Shazam\" #29 (May–June 1977), his original benefactor Prince Lucifer gives him greater power briefly, but he turns back on purpose to escape the affections of villainess Aunt Minerva after getting advice from Solomon.\n\nBefore the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Ibac is a member of the Monster Society Of Evil, a team of Captain Marvel's greatest enemies, and joined the first Silver Age version. More recently, he has turned up in \"Villains United\" as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains.\n\nOne Year Later, Ibac appeared in the \"Secret Six\" series, still with the Society, battling the second Ragdoll on the orders of the Society. Ragdoll escapes, leaving a wounded Ibac. (Secret Six 02, 2006)\n\nIbac is seen among the captured villains in \"Salvation Run\". There he is in Camp Lex and starts an argument with the people that are not working to help build the machine they need to escape back to Earth.\n\nIbac was also in the \"DC Holiday Special '09\" issue fighting Captain Marvel once again, but in the spirit of the holiday, cease fighting and work together to rebuild what they destroyed during their brawl. Captain Marvel gives him amnesty to walk away free. In the last panel, both are shown at a soup kitchen in their human forms, but neither recognizes the other's alter-ego.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Ibac is depicted as an evil barbaric ruler who enslaved the Khandaq people before being defeated and turned into stone by Black Adam whose family he murdered. Centuries later one of his descendants takes the same name only to be also killed by Adam.\n\nIbac has superhuman strength (almost on par with Captain Marvel, but not equally as strong), speed, agility and endurance which he gets by saying \"IBAC\". He also turns back by saying \"IBAC\" making him, like Captain Marvel Jr. unable to identify himself by name. He has some protection from physical and energy attacks. In his Ibac form, Stanley possesses the following attributes:\n\nThe Pre-Crisis version claimed not to have invulnerability, however he was very resistant.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066293", "title": "Born Yesterday (1950 film)", "text": "Born Yesterday (1950 film)\n\nBorn Yesterday is a 1950 American comedy-drama film directed by George Cukor, based on the 1946 stage play of the same name by Garson Kanin. The screenplay was credited to Albert Mannheimer. According to Kanin's autobiography, Cukor did not like Mannheimer's work, believing it lacked much of the play's value, so he approached Kanin about adapting a screenplay from his own play. Because of legal entanglements, Kanin did not receive screen credit.\n\nThe film tells the story of an uneducated young woman, Billie Dawn (played by Judy Holliday, in an Oscar-winning performance) and an uncouth, older, wealthy junkyard tycoon, Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) who comes to Washington to try to \"buy\" a congressman. When Billie embarrasses him socially, Brock hires journalist Paul Verrall (William Holden) to educate her. In the process, Billie learns how corrupt Harry is, and eventually falls in love with Paul.\n\nThe film was produced and released by Columbia Pictures. Ironically, Kanin frequently stated that Harry Brock was modeled on Columbia production chief Harry Cohn, with whom Kanin had a long and testy relationship. According to Cohn biographer Bob Thomas, Cohn knew of Kanin's attribution but didn't care about it.\n\nIn 2012, \"Born Yesterday\" was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nBullying, uncouth junkyard tycoon Harry Brock goes to Washington, D.C. with his brassy girlfriend, Emma \"Billie\" Dawn, and his crooked lawyer, Jim Devery (played by Howard St. John) to \"influence\" a politician or two. As a legal precaution, Devery presses Harry to marry Billie, as a wife cannot be forced to testify against her husband.\n\nHarry becomes disgusted with Billie's ignorance and lack of manners, though his are much worse. He hires a journalist, Paul Verrall (William Holden) who had come to interview him, to educate her and give her some culture. Blossoming under Paul's encouragement and her own hard work, Billie learns about literature, history, politics and the law, and turns out to be much smarter than anyone knew.\n\nBillie starts thinking for herself and applying her learning to her situation. She also falls in love with Paul, who respects and appreciates her. When she stands up to Harry, he reacts violently, striking her and forcing her to sign the contracts related to his crooked deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Devery has persuaded Harry to sign over many of his assets to Billie to hide them from the government. When Harry experiences Billie's new independence, he tries to intimidate her into signing his assets back to him. Billie and Paul use her leverage to escape from Harry's domination. She promises to give him back his property little by little as long as he leaves them alone. A brief final scene reveals that Billie and Paul have married.\n\nThough all the major Hollywood studios wanted to film Garson Kanin's Broadway play \"Born Yesterday\", Columbia Studios purchased the rights for $1 million in 1948. However, the project was put on the shelf for months because of casting problems. In April 1950, Columbia head Harry Cohn assigned George Cukor to direct the film, though Cukor was not the studio's first choice.\n\nCukor's preparatory work for \"Born Yesterday\" was quite innovative. The actors rehearsed the screenplay for two weeks, then performed it before an audience drawn from studio employees. Cukor's idea was to give the actors a chance to develop “dimensional characters,” and clock laugh values from audience reaction before the cameras began rolling. Cukor held that if a scene is funny, there is no need to play about with it. When people complained, “that laugh overrode the line, I did not hear the next line,” Cukor's answer remained the same, “Go and see the movie again.” But he did make some changes – when the laughter was long and loud, he added some visual detail.\n\nAccording to a Hollywood Reporter news item, Holliday initially refused to reprise her popular Broadway role for the film. In September 1947, Rita Hayworth was reported to be in line for the role, but in late April 1949, it was reported that Gloria Grahame was to be borrowed from RKO for the lead, and that Jean Arthur and Lana Turner had also been considered for the part. An October 16, 1947 Hollywood Reporter news item stated that Columbia was negotiating with Paul Douglas to reprise his Broadway role.\n\nAccording to modern sources, Kanin convinced Cohn to cast Holliday by first writing with his wife, Ruth Gordon, a part in the 1949 MGM film \"Adam's Rib\" particularly for her. Holliday's performance in the film garnered her critical acclaim and convinced Cohn of her comedic abilities. Larry Oliver and Frank Otto also reprised their Broadway roles. A September 20, 1950 article in the Los Angeles Daily News reported that before filming began, the cast perfected their comic timing during six performances in front of live audiences of studio employees.\n\nAlthough the film was clearly written for a mature audience, Kanin and Cukor were forced to amend the film to appease censors. Cukor explained, \"It seems ludicrous now, but twenty years ago you couldn't have a character say, 'I love that broad,' you couldn't even say \"broad.\" And the nonsense that went on to get over the fact that Judy Holliday and Broderick Crawford lived together! It required the greatest skill and some new business that Garson invented, like Billie Dawn always creeping into the apartment the back way. We managed to keep it amusing, I think, but it was so unnecessary.\"\n\nHowever, the censors thought the scrutiny was necessary, and Cukor was urged to use caution when filming Holliday's dresses. At that time, it was mandatory for intimate body areas, especially breasts, to be completely covered. The censors also requested that Cukor avoid any suggestion that Billie was trying to get Paul in bed. Billie's line \"Are you one of those talkers, or would you be interested in a little action?\" was deemed offensive. However, Cukor stood his ground, and the line made it into the final cut.\n\nIn the stage production, Holliday's character Billie Dawn wore only five costumes, but in the film, costume designer Jean Louis designed thirteen elaborate creations. Cukor asked Louis to “characterize” the clothes, with obviously expensive and ornate clothes at the beginning, when Billie is dumb and self-centered. However, as she acquires culture, her wardrobe becomes simpler and more elegant.\n\nTo increase the film's authenticity, Cukor went to Washington, D.C. for locations, and the city became a dramatic personage in the story. Six named Washington, D.C. locations (Jefferson Memorial, Library of Congress, National Gallery of Art, Statler Hotel, United States Capitol and the Watergate Steps, where Dawn and Verrall attend a then-regular outdoor summer concert of the National Symphony Orchestra) were included in the shoot. Observing tourists at the Lincoln Memorial, Cukor noticed that sightseers would chew gum and give works of art a cursory glance, if any at all. But in Hollywood movies, sightseers invariably were shown standing in rapt attention. Avoiding these cliches, Cukor considered the outdoor scenes among his best efforts.\n\nThe Hollywood premiere of \"Born Yesterday\" was attended by many celebrities and the film was met with enthusiastic applause. Jan Sterling and Paul Douglas, who had played the two leading roles on stage, attended the premiere.\n\nIn a review published the day after the film's premiere, Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Just in time to make itself evident as one of the best pictures of this fading year is Columbia's trenchant screen version of the stage play, 'Born Yesterday' ... On the strength of this one appearance, there is no doubt that Miss Holliday will leap into popularity as a leading American movie star.\" \"Variety\" stated, \"Columbia has a promising box-office offering in its screen version of the Broadway hit play, 'Born Yesterday.' The bright, biting comedy of the Garson Kanin legit piece adapts easily to film and there is every indication that key-city audiences will give it a hearty ticket play.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" called it \"an even more beguiling comedy than it was on the stage, and Judy Holliday's even funnier ... It's one of the few I'd like to see twice.\" A review in \"Harrison's Reports\" declared, \"An excellent adult comedy ... What really puts the picture over is the brilliant performance of Judy Holliday as the beautiful but dizzy 'girl-friend' of an unscrupulous, uncouth multi-millionaire junk dealer, whose downfall is brought about when he makes the mistake of deciding that she needs an education. One has to see and hear Miss Holliday to fully appreciate the superb delivery of her lines and the fine shadings of her artful mannerisms.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" stated, \"Garson Kanin's comedy is a pleasing lesson in the virtues of democracy, enlivened by smart, sometimes witty, dialogue and by characterisation which, if broad and simple, is always lively.\"\n\nSyndicated Catholic columnist William H. Mooring decried the film as \"clever film satire strictly from [Karl] Marx.\" In 1951, the film was picketed by the Anti-Communist Committee of the Catholic War Veterans because Holliday and Kanin were affiliated with organizations on the U.S attorney general's list of subversive groups.\n\nSupporters of the film included columnist Louella Parsons, reviewer William R. Weaver of the Motion Picture Herald and Kenneth Clark of the MPAA, who stated \"we feel very deeply and sincerely the picture gives warmth and positive support to the democratic ideals, principles and institutions of America.\"\n\nThe British film magazine \"Picturegoer\" awarded the film its Seal of Merit, but warned its readers that Holliday's character is \"from New York's East Side, and speaks in a baby Bronx voice that is like the tinkling of many tiny, tuneless cymbals.\" The magazine admired Holliday's performance and spoke of her in the same breath as Carole Lombard.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Kanin reportedly pursued plans for an updated remake, possibly starring Bette Midler or Whoopi Goldberg, as well as a musical version that might star Bernadette Peters or Dolly Parton, with Frank Sinatra as Harry Brock, but neither of these projects came to fruition. The remake was finally made in 1993, directed by Luis Mandoki and starring Melanie Griffith, Don Johnson and John Goodman.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066296", "title": "Ford Mustang SVT Cobra", "text": "Ford Mustang SVT Cobra\n\nThe Ford SVT Mustang Cobra (also known as SVT Mustang Cobra, SVT Cobra, or simply as Cobra) is a muscle car/pony car model that was built in model years 1993 through 2004 by Ford Motor Company's Special Vehicle Team division (or SVT, for short). The SVT Cobra was a high-performance version of the Ford Mustang, considered as top-of-the-line as it was positioned above the Mustang GT and Mach 1 models during its era of production. On three occasions, the race-ready, street-legal SVT Cobra R variant was produced in limited numbers. The SVT Cobra was succeeded by the 2007 Shelby GT500.\n\nThe 1993 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra was launched during the 1992 Chicago Auto Show. It was the premier vehicle of Ford's newly established SVT division, designed to showcase SVT's four hallmarks of Performance, Substance, Exclusivity and Value. The exterior of the 1993 SVT Cobra was similar to that year's GT model with differences explained below.\n\nThe upgrades were beneath the bodywork and featuring a V8 engine, producing at 4,600 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. According to \"Road & Track,\" this could send a Cobra through the 1/4 mile in 14.5 seconds at a trap speed of 98 mph (158 km/h). Acceleration from zero to took 5.9 seconds. The drivetrain received an upgraded transmission, rear disc brakes, and for the first time on a factory Mustang, 17\" unidirectional wheels. Cobra models received a softer, more compliant ride compared to the GT model. This was accomplished with model-specific springs and sway bars.\n\nThe 1993 SVT Cobra's short block (cylinder block, crankshaft, rods, and pistons) was carried over from the GT model. To this, Ford SVT engineers added the following performance items:\n\n\nWith the increased engine output of the new Mustang SVT Cobra, the Borg-Warner World Class T-5 transmission needed an internal upgrade, which allowed it to yield a higher torque capacity compared to the standard World Class T-5. This upgrade consisted of custom gearing 1–3 (which were reduced 10% and hardened), 4th/5th (just hardened) gear was the same as standard T-5s found in the LX/GTs. The holding capacity of the Cobra's clutch was increased by way of a higher clamping force pressure plate using the same 10 inch diameter as the GT/LX.\n\n\nThe Cobra featured a more subdued styling than the GT.\n\nThe 1993 Cobra was available in four exterior paint choices, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were Opal Gray cloth, Black cloth, and Opal Gray leather.\n\nIn the table below, the engine code (in bold) is the only unique code that differentiates the SVT Cobra from other Mustangs for the 1993 model year. Notice that the SVT Cobra and Mustang GT hatchback shared the same code for the body style/model number. Also, the street-spec Cobra and the race-ready Cobra R shared the same codes for body style, model number, and engine.\n\nThe 1993 Cobra R was the first of three Cobra R models produced, and it was an extremely exclusive vehicle. As the \"R\" designation in its name stood for \"Race\", the car did not have a radio, speakers, wiring and antenna, air conditioner, foglights, sound deadener, rear seat, rear safety belts, rear carpeting, and roll-up cargo cover, among other items. There were no power options; the car had power steering, roll-up windows, manual door locks, and manual-adjustable mirrors. Also, manually-adjustable Opal Gray cloth bucket seats from the Mustang LX were lighter than the GT/Cobra sport seats, and a piece of thin gray carpeting secured by Velcro covered the bare hatch and rear seat area. The deletion of all this equipment shed some 450 pounds, but it was somewhat offset by the necessary addition of heavy-duty hardware to enable the car to handle the rigors of competition.\n\nTo stiffen the chassis, a strut tower brace was installed to tie the cowl together, and a pair of V-braces (used on all 1983–1993 Mustang convertibles) attached in an X-pattern tied the subframes together. The Cobra R featured Eibach springs that were a bit too stiff for the street, but perfect on a racetrack. The Cobra R also benefitted from the adjustable Koni shocks and struts, helping to cement the car's reputation as a serious driving machine.\n\nThe car also featured massive 13\" Kelsey-Hayes vented rotors in front and 10.5\" vented rotors in back. According to Neil W. Ressler, the executive director of vehicle engineering for Ford Motor Company at the time and one of the founding fathers of SVT, the 1993 Cobra R's brakes \"\"were the most expensive brakes ever fitted to a\" [production] \"Mustang. I bought the brakes for the R model out of my engineering budget. I wanted big brakes, and we didn't have them. The program couldn't afford it. Unbeknownst to the higher-ups at Ford, I spent like $2,100 per car to buy those big brakes. But the last thing I wanted was a fast car that didn't stop. We ended up putting good brakes on all those\" [Cobra R] \"vehicles.\"\"\n\nThe same 5.0L V8 from the street-spec Cobra was used in the race-ready Cobra R. However, the radiator was unique to the Cobra R, and a purge tank was installed for improved cooling. A power steering cooler (located behind the left foglight bezel) and an engine oil cooler were standard.\n\nThe Cobra R wheels were actually the optional 17\" x 8\" five-lug wheels from the soon-to-be-released 1994 Mustang GT, but they were painted gloss black with a chrome lug cover. The wheels were wrapped with Goodyear Gatorbacks, which were the standard Cobra tires. To give the car better front-end geometry, lower control arms from the 1994 Mustang were fitted.\n\nContrary to SVT's stated wishes, many of these Cobra R models were purchased by private collectors and never actually driven, but several competed successfully in the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) Firestone Grand Sport Series and Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) World Challenge Class B Series. Of the three Cobra R models produced, the 1993 model had the benefit of being the lightest and the smallest.\n\nOnly 107 of these Cobra R models were produced, and all were painted in Vibrant Red Clearcoat. According to Ford's official announcement on April 7, 1993, the Cobra R was produced to take the Fox-bodied Mustang out in grand style, a \"best of the last\" model. According to SVT, each one could go 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds and do a top speed of 140 mph. With the 1993 SVT Cobra, the 1993 SVT Cobra R, and the 1993 SVT F-150 Lightning combined for a freshman effort, Ford's Special Vehicle Team appeared to be off to a good start in producing some of the most instantly collectible Fords from this time period.\n\nFord introduced the newly-redesigned 1994 Mustang in December 1993. It was the first major redesign since the Fox-bodied Mustang bowed for 1979. Known as Fox-4 (because it was based on the Fox platform as a 1994 model), the new 1994 Mustang was a vast improvement over the outgoing 1993 model. The new car's ride, handling, styling, ergonomics, and standard and optional equipment were all a major step forward from the previous model. As nice as the new 1994 Mustang was, it still left Ford enthusiasts yearning for more power. The and Pontiac Firebird Formula and Trans Am, all redesigned for 1993, came standard with . The 1994 Mustang GT engine only put out . Thus, a new SVT Cobra model was needed to bridge that performance gap.\n\nThe 1994 Cobra was introduced midway through the model year with the same beefed-up engine from the 1993 Cobra. With its GT-40 cast-iron heads and lower intake and its Cobra-specific upper intake, power increased incrementally to . However, the actual output of the Cobra's GT-40 enhanced engine was probably higher. Ford claimed a modest 6.3 seconds to hit 60 mph and a top speed of 140 mph. \"Muscle Mustangs & Fast Fords\" magazine tested a 1994 Cobra coupe and ran 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds and the quarter mile in 13.87 seconds at 99.49 mph.\n\nInitially, the 1994 SVT Cobra was only available as a coupe, but the first factory-produced SVT Cobra convertible was the 1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica. On the same day that the new 1994 Cobra coupe was launched, SVT announced that it would be building a Cobra convertible (the first factory-produced \"Cobra\" convertible since the 1970 Shelby models) and that this new convertible had been selected to pace the 1994 Indianapolis 500 (see the next section). The new Cobra convertible, or Indy 500 Pace Car Replica, was made available later in the 1994 model year.\n\nIf the 1993 Cobra and Cobra R laid the groundwork for super performance, then the 1994 Cobra began the tradition of offering refinements and subtle touches that made the car stand apart from its lesser Mustang brethren. Every subsequent model year, SVT's hallmarks of performance, substance, exclusivity, and value were met and exceeded, and the 1994 Cobra started this pattern of raising the bar over each previous model year.\n\nAccording to Jim Campisano's finely-written book \"Powered by SVT: Celebrating a Decade of Ford Performance,\" below is a list of items that set the 1994 SVT Cobra apart from the run-of-the-mill 1994 Mustang GT:\n\nBody and Appearance Components\n\nEngine and Chassis\n\nThe 1994 Cobra was available in three exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On the 1994 Cobra convertible (see the next section about the 1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica), the vinyl top was only available in saddle, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.\n\n\"NOTE: In the table below, paint colors marked with an asterisk (*) were non-clearcoat paints.\"\n\nIn the table below, the engine code (in bold) is the only unique code that differentiates the SVT Cobra from other Mustangs for the 1994 model year. Notice that the SVT Cobra and Mustang GT shared the same codes for the body style/model number.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nThe Ford Mustang turned 30 years old in 1994 and was met with corporate-sponsored enthusiasm. As a demonstration of this renewed enthusiasm, a trio of SVT Cobra convertibles served as pace cars for the 78th Indianapolis 500 race on May 29, 1994. The three cars were modified by Jack Roush at his shop in Allen Park, Michigan, for heavy-duty pacing on race day. The pace cars were installed with heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmissions, 15-gallon racing fuel cells, heavier rear springs (to accommodate the weight of television camera equipment), a Halon fire-extinguisher system, a rollbar with 50,000-watt strobe lights built in, and special lights in the rear spoiler. Parnelli Jones, a seven-time Indy 500 competitor who won the 1963 race, drove the official pace car at the event.\n\nTo commemorate the special occasion, SVT produced 1,000 Indy 500 Pace Car Replicas for the buying public. All 1,000 cars were painted Rio Red and fitted with Saddle leather interiors and matching Saddle vinyl tops. These special editions had the Indy 500 winged-tire logo emblazoned as a chrome cloisonné badge on the decklid and embroidered on the front seatbacks. A set of \"Official Pace Car\" decals came with each special-edition Cobra. These decals were not installed at the factory; rather, they were shipped inside the trunk and left to the buyer's discretion to install them. There was one very small difference between the decals worn by the three official pace cars and the replicas' decals. The tire logo on the official decals was white, and on the replica decals, it was gray.\n\nThe 1994 SVT Mustang Cobra was only the third Ford Mustang chosen for official pace car duties at the Indianapolis 500 race. The other two Mustangs that served as official Indy 500 pace cars were the very first Mustang in 1964 and the newly-redesigned Fox-bodied Mustang in 1979.\n\n \n\nThe 1995 Cobra was essentially a carryover of the 1994 model. The chrome SVT badge on the decklid was new for all SVT vehicles this year. A new vertical spat was added to the leading edge of each rocker panel extension to prevent rock damage to the lower body.\n\nThe Cobra convertible returned this year for a limited production run of 1,003 units, and all were painted Black and fitted with Saddle leather interiors and Black convertible tops. Newly available for the 1995 Cobra convertible was a removable hardtop option. This was a one-year-only option due to its $1,825 price and 90 pounds of additional weight; thus, only 499 of the 1,003 Cobra convertibles built this year had this option. Removing or installing the hardtop was a two-person job, and this hardtop could not easily fit any other Mustang or Cobra convertible from this vintage due to the latching mechanisms of the fiberglass top and the dome light wiring. Included with this option, a convenient carrier that rolled on four casters allowed for easier storage of the hardtop when it was not being used. This hardtop option was originally supposed to be an available option for the all-new 1994 Mustang convertible, but it was delayed due to supply problems and quality-control concerns. This hardtop option was also available on the 1995 Mustang GT convertible.\n\nThe biggest news for 1995 was the return of the street-legal, race-ready SVT Cobra R (see the next section).\n\nThe 1995 Cobra was available in the same three exterior paint colors from 1994, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were the same as in 1994: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On the 1995 Cobra convertible, the vinyl top was only available in black, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.\n\n\"NOTE: In the table below, paint colors marked with an asterisk (*) were non-clearcoat paints.\"\n\nIn the table below, the engine codes (in bold) are the only unique codes that differentiate the SVT Cobra from other Mustangs for the 1995 model year. Notice that the SVT Cobra and Mustang GT shared the same codes for the body style/model number.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nIn the wake of the '93 R's unexpected success, SVT engineers developed a more powerful R-model based on the 1995 Cobra. Top priority became addressing customer requests for a larger, more powerful engine and more fuel capacity. In response to those requests, SVT replaced the Cobra's 5.0 L V8 with an SVT modified version of Ford's 5.8 liter Windsor V8, re-engineered to produce and installed a 22-gallon fuel cell. To handle the torque of the more powerful engine, a Tremec 3550 5-speed manual transmission was installed. See also 5-speed T-5 manual. Again, weight-savings was targeted, so there was no back seat, radio, power windows/seats or air-conditioning—not even fog lights, which were omitted to provide ducts for getting cool air onto the front disk brakes. Heavy-duty progressive-rate springs, thicker stabilizer bars and a front strut tower brace helped improve handling on the racetrack. The 95 R was available only in white with saddle cloth interior, each with a unique center-tiered fiberglass hood tall enough to clear the engine and induction system. Only 250 vehicles were built; Ford kept 18 examples for its press and engineering fleets.\n\nUnlike the 93 Cobra R, one could only obtain a 95 R if they held a valid competition license (or owned a race team). This provision was added after Ford discovered that most of the 93 R's that were sold ended up in the hands of collectors. Nevertheless, several 95 R's found their way into collectors' hands.\n\nFor 1996, Ford finally retired the aging 5.0L V8 in the Mustang GT and SVT Cobra, replacing it with a new aluminum 4.6L DOHC modular unit that was smoother and had slightly better fuel economy. Starting with the 1996 model year, every Cobra engine was hand-assembled by two-person teams at the Ford Romeo Engine Plant in Romeo, Michigan, a practice that continued through the remainder of SVT Cobra production. Each engine had a label (later, a metal plaque on the 2003–2004 Cobra engines) bearing the names and signatures of the two engine builders. The Romeo engine, as it was called, produced and of torque, enabling the new Cobra to go 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds and do the quarter mile in 13.99 seconds at 101.6 mph. However, \"Car and Driver\" magazine was able to hit 60 mph in 5.4 seconds and the quarter mile in 14.00 seconds at 102 mph during a comparison test in their December 1995 issue. The 1996 Cobra engine redlined at 6,800 rpm, with fuel shut-off occurring at 7,000 rpm.\n\nFord's modular V8 debuted in the all-new 1992 Ford Crown Victoria as a single-overhead-cam (SOHC) setup, and then the engine really displayed its power potential with 32 valves, dual overhead cams (DOHC), and in the all-new 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII.\n\nThe modular engine's aluminum block was cast in Italy by Teksid, a firm that produces parts for Ferrari and Formula One racers. SVT fitted the 1996 Cobra with the Borg Warner T-45 5-speed manual transmission, which was also used in the Mustang GT. (Tremec bought the production rights for the T-45 in late 1998, although the unit remained unchanged in terms of strength.)\n\nThe 1996 Cobra was available in four exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were the same as before: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, saddle, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra for the 1996 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra from other 1996 Mustangs.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nTo promote the technological advances and mechanical achievements of its new modular engine, Ford introduced the Mystic Cobra for 1996, which featured high-tech, color-shifting paint formulated by BASF. Utilizing color-shifting ChromaFlair pigments from Flex Products, the Mystic paint shifted from green to amber to gold to purple depending on the angle and the availability of light. The research and development process for this paint took three years to complete. Only available on the Cobra coupe, the Mystic paint option cost only $815 at the time, and the 1996 Mystic Cobra was the first production vehicle to wear a color-shifting factory paint job. Only 1,999 Mystic Cobras were produced, and of these, 1,990 had black leather interiors and nine had black cloth interiors. Since the paint continues to have special proprietary uses, any remaining quantities are tightly controlled and thus require a VIN verification through a complying Ford body shop to obtain the special paint in order to repaint any damaged areas.\n\nThe 1997 Cobra was basically a carryover of the 1996 model. Only an astute observer noticed that the honeycomb grille from before was now absent to allow more airflow into the larger radiator included across the entire Mustang lineup, and the 1997 Cobra had a larger diameter fan. Also new was a parallel-flow air conditioning condenser that was exclusive to the SVT Cobra. The rear spoiler was now optional, as it had been standard on all previous models.\n\nThe only other major changes for 1997 was in the color palette. The 1997 Cobra was available in four exterior colors, as shown in the table below. The interior choices were the same as what was offered in 1996: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was again available in black, saddle, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra for the 1997 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra from other 1997 Mustangs.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nThe 1998 Cobra continued to remain virtually unchanged from previous model years. One noticeable change was the wheels, which were similar to the cast-aluminum units used on the 1995 Cobra R. Only this time, the wheel cutouts were painted gray, and the wheels measured 17\" x 8\", instead of 17\" x 9\" on the 1995 Cobra R. The wheels continued to be wrapped in the same BF Goodrich Comp T/A tires from before. Other minor changes included a redesigned console in which the dashboard-mounted digital clock pod was deleted, and the clock function was then integrated into the radio's digital display. Also, the standard premium sound system now included a single-disc CD player.\n\nThis was also the last year of the return-style fuel system, as it was replaced with a newer returnless system for 1999.\n\nThe 1998 Cobra was available in five exterior colors, as shown in the table below. Chrome Yellow was added midyear on the 1998 Cobra. The interior choices were the same as before: Black cloth, Saddle cloth, Black leather, and Saddle leather. However, the leather pattern changed. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was again available in black, saddle, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.\n\n\"NOTE: In the table below, paint colors marked with an asterisk (*) were available at midyear.\"\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra for the 1998 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra from other 1998 Mustangs.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nFor the 1999 model year, Ford restyled the fourth-generation Mustang utilizing Ford's \"\"New Edge\"\" design language. The facelifted car featured newly redesigned body panels that followed Ford's new worldwide styling direction. Thus, the interior was basically a carryover from the 1994–1998 Mustangs, and most of the parts were interchangeable. All 1999–2004 SVT Cobras featured independent rear suspension, unique to only the Cobra. A new returnless fuel system was used which helped Ford meet tightening emission standards.\n\nThe new 1999 Cobra had an upgraded 4.6L DOHC V8 engine rated at and of torque. However, when the new 1999 Cobras were put through their paces by their new owners, it was revealed that 0-60 mph times were slower than a comparably-equipped 1998 model, and dyno tests suggested that the advertised power output was closer to , even though Ford claimed that the engine was outputting 15 hp more than the 1998 Cobra engine. Due to this outcry, on August 6, 1999, Ford halted the sales of all unsold 1999 Cobras on dealership lots and recalled all 1999 Cobras that had been sold. Ford replaced the intake manifold, certain computer components, and the exhaust system from the catalytic converters to the tailpipes in order to achieve a \"true\" 320 hp at the crankshaft.\n\nThe 1999 Cobra was available in four exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were limited to two offerings: Dark Charcoal and Medium Parchment. The standard leather seats were the same optional leather units used in the 1999 Mustang GT, but without the embroidered running pony logo on the front seatbacks. Cloth seats were no longer offered on the Cobra, as they were never popular with buyers in previous model years. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, parchment, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular 1999 Mustang convertibles.\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra for the 1999 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra from other 1999 Mustangs.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nFor 2000, the SVT Cobra R returned for a limited production run of 300 units. As the standard 2000 Cobra was cancelled due to problems with the 1999 Cobras, the Cobra R was SVT's sole high-performance Mustang for the 2000 model year. The new Cobra R came standard with a DOHC V8 engine with a 6,500 rpm redline that was rated at at 5,700 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. However, independent dyno tests have shown that the Cobra R produced rear-wheel output that nearly matched both of those numbers, suggesting the engine may have been underrated. The cast iron block was based on the 5.4L block that Ford used in its trucks at the time. The cylinder heads were later used in the 2005–2006 Ford GT, albeit slightly modified. Some sources claimed that the Australian FPV GT's engine was very similar to the Cobra R's mill. As with previous Cobra R models, the 2000 model was designed to be a race-ready, high-performance vehicle in a perfectly street-legal package; as such, it lacked many of the creature comforts that the standard Cobra enjoyed. This model had no radio/audio equipment, no air conditioning, no cruise control, and no rear seat. Each of the 300 units produced featured a Performance Red exterior and a Dark Charcoal interior with cloth Recaro bucket seats.\n\nThe 2000 Cobra R had several distinguishing visual and performance features that set it apart from the standard 1999 or 2001 Cobra. The \"power dome\" hood, for instance, was taller than the standard Cobra hood, and it had gills that could be cut out to help reduce engine compartment temperatures. The rear spoiler was tall and wide, providing much needed downforce at track speeds. The Cobra R was equipped with Eibach springs that lowered the car 1.5 inches in front and 1.0 inch out back. This model also used Bilstein shocks and struts, Brembo 4-piston front calipers acting on 13-inch rotors cooled by large ducts, along with a race-style fuel cell that was clearly protruding under the Mustang V6-style rear bumper. The front fascia was adorned with a low-riding, removable splitter. The wheels were also uniquely styled, silver-painted, five-spoke, x alloys wrapped in aggressive BF Goodrich G-Force KD tires. The hand-built SVT engine employed special DOHC cylinder heads, a \"trumpet-style\" intake manifold, aggressive camshafts, short tube headers connected to Cobra catalysts, a Bassani X-pipe, and a unique Borla dual side-exiting exhaust system, which was necessitated by the large fuel cell. This model also featured 3.55 gears, a Gerodisc hydro-mechanical differential with speed and torque sensitivity, and a Tremec T-56 6-speed manual transmission that was closely geared for drag racing or road course usage. Despite these close ratios, the 2000 Cobra R also enjoyed a 177 mph (282 km/h) top speed.\n\nA number of well-known makers of aftermarket performance parts for the Mustang were involved in this project, including Recaro, Brembo, McLeod, Eibach, BF Goodrich, Tremec, Borla, Dana, Federal Mogul, and K&N (among others).\n\nThe following is a list of parts on the 2000 Cobra R that differ from the standard 1999 Cobra:\n\nExterior\n\nInterior\n\nDrivetrain\n\nA Quick Word on the 2000 SVT Cobra that never was...\n\nBecause of the 1999 Cobra performance debacle, the standard 2000 SVT Cobra was pulled from production, only to return in 2001 rated at a true 320 hp. The production run of the 2000 SVT Cobra R (see below) went ahead without issue. Ford still printed brochures for the 2000 Cobra, with a print date of December 1999, four months after the 2000 model was officially cancelled. The reason for this was because these brochures talked about the upcoming 2000 Cobra R.\n\nAccording to the 2000 Cobra brochure, if the 2000 Cobra had been produced, it would have been available in six exterior paint colors: Crystal White Clearcoat, Ebony (Black) Clearcoat, Laser Red Tinted Clearcoat, Medium Atlantic Blue Clearcoat Metallic, Silver Clearcoat Metallic, and (most notable) Mystic Gold. Apparently, Mystic Gold was supposed to be available in limited numbers late in the model year. After the 1996 Mystic Cobra, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra would have been the second time that a color-shifting paint was used on the Cobra. It was said that the Mystic Gold paint had a color shift from burnt orange to gold to yellow to pale green. Unfortunately, Ford made some changes to the painting process for the 2001 model year, and the Mystic Gold paint was incompatible with the new process. Thus, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra never saw the light of day, but a photograph of a prototype painted Mystic Gold will forever be memorialized in the 2000 Cobra brochure.\n\nAside from paint colors, the standard 2000 SVT Cobra was pretty much a carryover of the 1999 model. Even the interior was supposed to be the same as in 1999. Only two color choices, Dark Charcoal and Medium Parchment, were supposed to be offered again.\n\nThe 2000 Cobra R was only available in one exterior paint color, as shown in the table below. The sole interior color choice was Dark Charcoal. The standard cloth Recaro bucket seats had a stylized red \"R\" with an intertwined Cobra logo embroidered on the front seatbacks.\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra R for the 2000 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra R from other 2000 Mustangs.\n\nThe price below is in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nWhile the 2001 Cobra shared almost all the same components of the 1999 Cobra, some changes were made including:\n\n\nWith the above list of changes, the 2001 Cobra was able to go 0-60 mph in 5.4 seconds and do the quarter mile in 13.8 seconds at 102 mph. The cars were electronically limited to a top speed of 150 mph.\n\nThe 2001 Cobra was available in eight exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. There were only two interior color choices: Dark Charcoal (the interior environment was Dark Charcoal, and the seats had Dark Charcoal leather bolsters with Medium Graphite Alcantara inserts) or Medium Parchment (the interior environment was Medium Parchment, but the seats had Chocolate Brown leather bolsters with Medium Parchment Alcantara inserts). In keeping with SVT's attention to detail, the Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a somewhat darker color than the suede inserts to provide a subtle contrast. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, parchment, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular 2001 Mustang convertibles.\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra for the 2001 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra from other 2001 Mustangs.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nAlthough many enthusiasts believe there were no 2002 Cobras, approximately 100 vehicles were partially built in the US and shipped to Australia for right-hand-drive conversion and final assembly by Ford Tickford Experience (FTE). The vehicles were based on the 2001-spec SVT Cobra. Other changes included additional driving lights in the lower front fascia to meet Australian lighting specifications, and the steering wheel was moved to the right side of the car. This was part of a $4 million program by Ford Australia to combat the rival Holden Monaro, which eventually formed the basis of the reborn 2004–2006 Pontiac GTO in the U.S.\n\nFor more information about the Australian 2002 Cobras, see 2002 Mustang Cobra.\n\nDebuting in the spring of 2002, the 2003 Cobra came with a supercharged, 32-valve DOHC, 4.6-liter V8 engine rated at and of torque. Code-named \"Terminator\" by the SVT development crew led by John Coletti, numerous improvements were made to the powertrain and driveline to handle the power increase from the previous model's set-up. A cast-iron block was used, instead of the previous Teksid aluminum unit, with stronger internals including Zollner pistons and forged Manley H-beam connecting rods that were modified with a wrist pin oiling hole by the SVT engineers. These upgrades were critical in order to support the of boost delivered from the stock Eaton M-112 roots-type supercharger. Other improvements included the use of a lightweight aluminum flywheel connected to a Tremec T-56 six-speed transmission, 3.55:1 rear axle ratio, and stronger 31-spline halfshafts with revised upper and lower control arms. These modifications enabled the Cobra to go 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds and do the quarter mile in 12.67 seconds at 110.11 mph. Although electronically-governed to a top speed of 153 mph, a factory-stock Terminator Cobra can reach a top speed of just under 180 mph if the governor is removed.\n\nThe 2003 Cobra boasted visual and functional improvements designed by Camilo Pardo, the chief designer of the 2005–2006 Ford GT supercar. These exterior differences included a new front fascia with an integrated spoiler and front brake air ducts, a new rear fascia with a black insert which visually integrated the exhaust pipes, a composite hood with dual functional heat extractors, newly designed side scoops, and foldable sideview mirrors painted in the matching body color. The side skirts were designed specifically for the Terminator Cobra body kit, featuring a smooth body line from the door to the bottom of the car. As a visual departure from the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Cobras (there was no 2002 Cobra model), which featured the Canadian Mustang taillights with separate amber turn signals, the 2003–2004 Cobras used standard red Mustang taillights with integrated turn signals. SVT also introduced new five-spoke 17\" x 9\" rims, available in standard machined-faced aluminum with metallic argent-painted pockets or optional chrome. Finally, the Terminator Cobra sported a new decklid spoiler with an integrated LED brake light, as opposed to the wing-type spoiler seen on previous Cobras and the standard Mustang V6 and GT models. It was optional to delete the spoiler, and the brake light was then integrated into the decklid using conventional bulbs.\n\nBy the end of the model year, the 2003 Cobra was offered in ten exterior paint colors, but initially, it was available in seven colors. Early 2003 Cobras built between May and September 2002 were produced concurrently with the 2002 Mustang V6 and GT models. Since Satin Silver and Mineral Grey were 2002 colors, they were replaced with Silver Metallic and Dark Shadow Grey Metallic, respectively, at the start of regular 2003 Mustang production on September 29, 2002. Redfire Metallic replaced Torch Red only because it was a new color for the 2003 model year; however, Torch Red would make a comeback at the end of the model year on the 10th Anniversary Edition (see the next section). All 2003 Cobras had Dark Charcoal interiors. The seats were upholstered with Dark Charcoal Nudo leather bolsters and suede inserts in either Medium Graphite (light gray) or Medium Parchment (tan). The Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a color that matched the suede inserts; however, on the 10th Anniversary Edition, this same emblem was embroidered in dark charcoal-colored thread to contrast with the special red leather inserts. On Cobra convertibles, the canvas convertible top was either black or parchment depending on the color of the chosen suede seat inserts, and on 10th Anniversary Edition convertibles, the canvas convertible top was only available in black.\n\n\"NOTE: In the table below, paint colors marked with an asterisk (*) were available at the start of regular 2003 Mustang production on September 29, 2002.\"\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra for the 2003 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra from other 2003 Mustangs.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nFor 2003, SVT offered a limited-edition 10th Anniversary Cobra to celebrate ten years since the introduction of the first SVT Mustang Cobra in 1993. The car featured unique seven-spoke, dark argent-painted, 17\" alloy wheels; Dark Charcoal interior with Colorado Red leather inserts on the seats; red inserts in the door panels; red-painted brake calipers; and special 10th Anniversary badges on the decklid and floormats. Also included was special carbon fiber-patterned leather wrapped around the shifter; emergency brake handle; and on the steering wheel at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The Anniversary model was the first Cobra to feature a steering wheel with grip humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. SVT produced 2,003 (same number as the model year) units of the Anniversary model at the end of the model year during June and July 2003, totaling 1,003 coupes and 1,000 convertibles. The 10th Anniversary models were only available in three exterior colors: Black (775 models), Torch Red (734 models), and Silver Metallic (494 models). The 10th Anniversary Edition package (order code 375A) was a $1,495 option.\n\nThe 2004 Cobra was a carryover of the 2003 Cobra but with a few minor updates, including a slightly updated exhaust system and rumors of a 20+ horsepower increase over the 2003 model. The addition of a newly integrated shift light negated the $1,000 gas guzzler tax that was charged on the 2003 models. One notable new option across the entire Ford lineup was the available Sirius satellite radio; the distinguishing feature between the 2003 and 2004 factory sound systems was the \"SAT\" button on the 2004 system.\n\nThe 2004 Cobra was produced between November 2003 and March 2004. It was a short model year for the 2004 Terminator Cobra, as well as the entire 2004 Mustang lineup, due to a number of reasons. The 2004 Mustangs and Cobras were the last Mustangs to be built at Ford's historic Dearborn Assembly Plant in Dearborn, Michigan, and Ford Motor Company had made the decision to end Mustang production there rather than updating the plant for the 2005 models. Thus, 2004 production was scheduled to wrap up by May 2004. Another reason was the hype over the all-new 2005 Mustang, which meant that Ford needed to start production as soon as possible at the newly updated Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, then known as AutoAlliance International.\n\nThe 2004 Cobra was available in eight exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Zinc Yellow was replaced by Screaming Yellow across the Mustang lineup for 2004; however, Sonic Blue Metallic and Dark Shadow Grey Metallic were still available on regular 2004 Mustangs. The seats were upholstered with Dark Charcoal Nudo leather bolsters and suede inserts in either Dark Charcoal or Medium Graphite. Medium Parchment suede inserts were no longer offered. The Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a medium graphite-colored thread regardless of the color of the suede seat inserts; however, on the Mystichrome Cobra (see the next section), this same emblem was embroidered in dark charcoal-colored thread to contrast with the special Mystichrome leather inserts. On all 2004 Cobra convertibles, the canvas convertible top was only available in black, regardless of the color and material of the seat inserts.\n\nIn the table below, the codes in bold are unique to the SVT Cobra for the 2004 model year, and these codes differentiate the SVT Cobra from other 2004 Mustangs.\n\nAll prices below are in United States dollars when the vehicles were sold new at a Ford dealership before any available options were added.\n\nThe limited-edition 2004 Mystichrome Cobra debuted at the 2003 New York International Auto Show alongside the 2004 40th Anniversary Mustang GT and V6 models. According to SVT's press release, the Mystichrome Cobra was produced to help commemorate the Mustang's 40th anniversary year. SVT had recognized the importance of this milestone, and shortly after the success of the 1996 Mystic Cobra, SVT worked with Ford's product planners and outside vendors to build the ultimate special edition Cobra. DuPont was commissioned to work on an improved formulation of color-shifting paint that would be easier to use and match. The resulting Mystichrome paint, sold to BASF who finally supplied the paint to Ford, contained ChromaFlair pigments that rendered a shift from a bright topaz green to cobalt blue, then to royal purple, and finally to a deep onyx black. A high amount of metallic aluminum flakes were added to give the Mystichrome paint some sparkle. The paint is called \"2004 Ford Mustang Cobra MystiChrome Metallic\" and cost, at the time, about $150 per pint. As the Mystichrome paint is still very expensive, any kind of exterior damage to the car is financially problematic. If a damaged Mystichrome Cobra requires repainting at a reputable Ford dealer's body shop, a Ford employee from Dearborn headquarters is required to bring the paint in person and supervise the usage of the special paint. The damaged car must be verified that it is a factory-built Mystichrome Cobra. Once the body shop is finished using the Mystichrome paint, all unused paint must be put back in the can and sealed, and the supervising Ford employee returns to Dearborn with the unused paint.\n\nSVT worked with Garden State Tanning to produce the Mystichrome leather found on the car's seat inserts and the steering wheel at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The production process for the Mystichrome leather included tanning and dying the leather jet black, spraying the Mystichrome paint directly onto the leather, and sealing it with a clear layer to protect and prevent damage to the Mystichrome-painted leather. Like the 2003 10th Anniversary Cobra, the Mystichrome Cobra featured a steering wheel with grip humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. The Mystichrome Cobra came standard with the five-spoke 17\" chrome wheels.\n\nThe Mystichrome Cobra was produced between December 2003 and January 2004.

In December, over a thousand Pulahanes besieged a detachment of native scouts in the town of Taft.\n\nIn December 1904, the 38th Philippine Constabulary Scouts, under Lieutenant Stephen Hayt, were on patrol along the Dolores River in an attempt to link up with the 37th Constabulary Scouts and another Constable Company led by Lieutenant Hendryx.\n\nThe 38th was ambushed en route, by over 1,000 Pulahanes. As the Pulahanes rushed, waving colorful banners and shouting \"Tad-Tad!\" (Cut To Pieces!) they were met with a volley of rifle-fire that stopped their advance. The Constables held their ground and repelled the attacks, inflicting heavy losses with accurate and steady rifle fire.\n\nThe Pulahanes were far greater in number, however, and they eventually enveloped and wiped out the entire scout force.\n\nOf the 43 man contingent, the officer and 37 of his men were killed. The Pulajans on the other hand, suffered much heavier losses.

{"id": "2066310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066310", "title": "Hoppy the Marvel Bunny", "text": "Hoppy the Marvel Bunny\n\nHoppy the Marvel Bunny is a fictional comic book superhero and funny animal originally published by Fawcett Comics as a spin-off of Captain Marvel. He was created by Chad Grothkopf (1914–2005), and debuted in \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\" #1 (Dec. 1942). Hoppy later became a property of DC Comics, and has made periodic appearances in stories related to Captain Marvel, today also known as Shazam.\n\nIn 1942, Fawcett Comics, decided to add a funny animal comic book to accompany its line of superhero, movie, and adventure comics. Chad Grothkopf, an artist with experience at DC Comics and Timely Comics, was tapped to come up with concepts for Fawcett's \"Funny Animals\" comic; his creations included Willie the Worm, Shelock Monk and Chuck, and Hoppy, a rabbit who dreamed of being strong. For the latter character, Grothkopf added elements from Fawcett's popular Captain Marvel strips, and the lead strip for \"Funny Animals\" was set as \"Hoppy the Marvel Bunny\".\n\nHoppy debuted in \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\" #1, and appears in nearly every issue of that comic's run. He also starred in his own 15-issue series, \"Hoppy the Marvel Bunny\" (Dec. 1945 – Sept. 1947), which featured several Hoppy stories per issue, along with stories featuring his old co-stars from \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\". One of his foes is Captain Black Bunny, the lagomorph equivalent of Captain Marvel's foe Black Adam.\n\nHoppy's stories include \"Hoppy the Marvel Bunny and the Paper Dolls of Victory!\", \"The Keepers of the Winds\" and \"Hoppy Duels with Stinger Bee.\"\n\nFor a span of five issues (#49–54, May–Oct. 1947), Hoppy made no appearances in \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\"; these issues featured Billy the Kid and Oscar as the lead feature. Beginning with #55, Hoppy returned as the main feature. \n\nIn \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\" #69 (Feb. 1951), the Captain Marvel Bunny stories were dropped, replaced by more standard funny-animal stories with just Hoppy. There was no further mention of his career as Captain Marvel Bunny. In issue #80 the word \"Fawcett's\" was dropped from the title, making the remaining issues simply \"Funny Animals\". The final issue of \"Funny Animals\" was #83 (1953).\n\nAfter Fawcett cancelled \"Funny Animals\", the rights to many of its characters were purchased by Charlton Comics. Charlton resumed publication of \"Funny Animals\" with #84 and continued the series to #91 (February 1956). Hoppy also appeared in Charlton's \"Atomic Mouse\", though these stories appear to be edited reprints from \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\". For these reprints, Charlton removed the lightning bolt from Marvel Bunny's suit and recolored the costume, changing his name to Magic Bunny and his magic word to \"Alizam!\". He is alternately referred to in various Charlton books as \"Hoppy\", \"Happy\", \"Happy the Magic Bunny\" and, according to one source, \"Speedy\".\n\nAfter the Fawcett characters were purchased by DC Comics, Hoppy returned in \"DC Comics Presents\" #34 (June 1981). Hoppy has turned up sporadically since, primarily in \"Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz-Wonderland War\" #2, in \"The Power of Shazam!\" #29, and in \"Tiny Titans\" #15. A modernized version of Hoppy has made a handful of appearances in the revamped \"New 52\"/\"DC Rebirth\" interpretation of \"Shazam!\", beginning in 2012.\n\nHoppy is a pink rabbit who lives in the town of Funny Animalville, along with an assortment of other funny animal characters. As revealed in the origin story from \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\" #1, Hoppy is a fan of Captain Marvel. One day, he decides to emulate his hero and speaks the magic word \"Shazam!\" Surprisingly, the magic word transforms Hoppy into Captain Marvel Bunny.\nIn \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\" #30 (July 1945), an explanation for Hoppy's powers is revealed. In the story \"Hoppy Meets the Wizard Bunny\", Hoppy is hit on the head and develops amnesia. The mysterious Wizard Bunny (or Bunny Wizard, both versions are used) is watching, and he flies down to help Hoppy regain his memory. A panel in this story states \"Because it was he who bestowed the magic word and power upon Hoppy, the Bunny Wizard flies down to Earth to help Hoppy\". Eventually, the Wizard gets Hoppy to say \"Shazam!\" and his memory is restored, along with his abilities. This is the Bunny Wizard's only known appearance.\n\nThe word \"Shazam!\" has a slightly different meaning for Hoppy. According to the E. Nelson Bridwell-scripted story, \"Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz-Wonderland War\" #2, Captain Marvel Bunny has the wisdom of Salamander, the strength of Hogules, the stamina of Antlers, the power of Zebreus, the courage of Abalone, and the speed of Monkury.\n\nHoppy's stories occasionally feature his girlfriend Millie, who (like Lois Lane) despises the meek Hoppy, but adores the heroic Captain Marvel Bunny. Millie has no idea that Hoppy can become Captain Marvel Bunny. \nA noteworthy foe appeared in \"Fawcett's Funny Animals\" #32 (Oct–Nov 1945). In the lead story of that issue, Hoppy faces Captain Black Bunny, who is based on Captain Marvel's foe Black Adam. Captain Black Bunny wears a black costume similar to Black Adam's, though the evil bunny wears a cape like Hoppy and instead of a lightning bolt he has a yellow flame on his chest. Captain Black Bunny comes from deep within the Earth's core and is aided by a gang of imps. \nIn Hoppy's first appearance in DC Comics (in \"DC Comics Presents\" #34), Hoppy and Millie find themselves magically transported to Earth-S, the home of the Marvel Family in the Pre-\"Crisis\" DC Universe. He aids the Marvel Family and Superman against Mr. Mind, Mr. Mxyzptlk, and King Kull. In this story, both Hoppy and Millie were depicted as white bunnies, instead of their usual pink.\n\nHoppy next appears in \"Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz-Wonderland War\" #2 (1986), where he fights alongside the Zoo Crew. His silhouette is briefly seen in Limbo, where forgotten characters from DC continuity currently reside, pursued by Ace the Bat-Hound, during the events of \"Final Crisis\" in 2009.\n\nFollowing DC's 2011 \"New 52\" reboot, Hoppy was reimagined as the pet of Mary Bromfield in the rebooted \"Shazam!\" franchise. In \"Shazam!\" #1 (February 2019), Hoppy is accidentally struck by magic lightning when Mary and her foster sister Darla Dudley say \"Shazam!\" and assume their superhero forms. As a result, Hoppy acquires superpowers (flight and lightning-emitting eyes, among others) and his fur pattern reflects the lightning-bolt emblem of the Shazam Family.\n\nHoppy has powers roughly similar to those of Captain Marvel/Shazam. He accesses his powers by yelling \"Shazam!\", but his pantheon differs. His patron deities are Salamander, Hogules, Antlers, Zebreus, Abalone and Monkury.\n\nIn \"American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944\", Kurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas write, \"It was cover star Hoppy the Marvel Bunny who made \"FFA\" special. Creator Chad Grothkopf struck a balance in his stories between the usual funny animal tropes, fairy tale-style fantasy, and full-tilt super-heroics, the strip's only sticking point the tiresome gimmick of Hoppy never being able to remember his magic word. Whether battling piscine pirate Captain Kid Perch, the Witch, King Artist of Picture Land, or Simon Spider and his living dolls, Marvel Bunny always delivered big laughs and plenty of action.\"\n\n\n"}

It provides developers with a common layer to create their own Gnutella or Gnutella2 client or network. As a separate component, GnucDNA can be updated independently of the client, passing down improvements to the applications already using it.\n\nGnucDNA is a widespread and established library which can be extended by programmers. It includes the capability of forming a decentralized network between peers with integrated Ultrapeer support, allowing the network to avoid bottlenecks of low bandwidth nodes. However, the Ultrapeer - respectively Hub on G2 - support is outdated compared to modern implementations by clients like gtk-gnutella and Shareaza.\n\nThe library gives programs which link to it the ability to share files with built-in support for uploading, downloading, file queuing and partial file sharing (the ability to upload verified chunks of a file while it is downloading), hash those files, extract meta-data to be shared through the network, and the ability to perform advanced searching by specific hash and meta-data parameters. GnucDNA also offers applications the ability to update their software easily through the same P2P network that they create.\n\nThe GnucDNA component is COM based to inherit the advantage of language independence and versatility. Applications in C++, Visual Basic, .Net, and even scripts can utilize GnucDNA. Also by being a separate component, it can be used in a number of alternate situations such as part of a plugin, a service or running behind a web server.\n\nOver five years of development have already gone into coding, improving, and testing the GnucDNA as part of the Gnucleus project. As others took notice of the project the engine was duplicated over 15 times, but while the interfaces and services others provided were great, they could not keep up with the main development. So the decision was taken, to move the Gnucleus engine, now called GnucDNA, into a separate component, so that anyone has access to it without fear of falling behind in the developments and improvements that are made. It also opens up new doors for those interested in creating their own P2P networks, but do not want to re-invent the low layer communication and file transfer mechanisms.\n\nGnucleus is the gnutella and Gnutella2 client project for Microsoft Windows that the GnucDNA library code originally has been developed in, before it was split to a semi-separated project. Just like the GnucDNA library, it has been released under the GNU General Public License.\n\nThe client is designed to be easy to use without reducing the number of options available. Gnucleus implements a number of features including \"Ultrapeer\" capability on gnutella (resp. \"Hub\" mode on G2), multisource swarming downloads, partial-file sharing, SHA1 file hashing, Tiger tree sub chunk verification and proxy server support.\n\nKiwi Alpha is a peer-to-peer file sharing application that uses the GnucDNA library to connect to the gnutella and G2 networks. Its design goal focusses on leaving a small resource footprint and being simple to use for beginners.\n\nKiwi Alpha doesn't contain functionality such as media players, in the spirit of its \"lightweight\" goal. However, the application comes with two bundled pieces of adware, such as SaveNow, which seems to contradict the small footprint goal. Also, the program's website states that \"\"Kiwi Alpha does not require users to register and protects the user's privacy by connecting anonymously to the network\"\". This is misleading, as both supported protocols do not obfuscate the user's IP address, which the statement seems to indicate.\n\n"}

{"id": "2066349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066349", "title": "Gunge", "text": "Gunge\n\nGunge as it is known in the United Kingdom, or slime as it is known in the United States and most English-speaking areas of the world, is a thick, gooey, yet runny substance with a consistency somewhere between that of paint and custard. It has been a feature on many children's programmes for many years around the world and has made appearances in game shows as well as other programming. While gunge mostly appears on television, it can also be used as a fundraising tool for charities, youth and religious groups. Gunge tanks have appeared at nightclubs and Fun Days. The British charities Comic Relief and Children in Need, supported by the BBC, have used gunge for fundraising in the past. In the U.S., slime is sometimes associated with Nickelodeon, even having several game shows revolving around it, such as \"Slime Time Live\".\n\nThe gunge that is widely used on television is an industrial powder thickener hydroxyethyl cellulose, mainly used in production of the sauce for apple pies. Alternatively, other items can be used for \"gunge\", for example eggs, sauces, as well as other messy items. In many cases, the gunging occurs in a gunge tank, a transparent booth with a means for storing and releasing the gunge. Due to source ingredients uses as food thickeners in soups and stews, gunge is often safe to eat, provided the colouring is also non-toxic. Other ingredients used in gunge can be Oobleck, a mixture of cornstarch and water, and Xanthan gum, another food additive.\n\nThe iconic green slime of the Canadian television series \"You Can't Do That on Television\" was developed by accident, according to producer Roger Price - the original idea had been to dump a barrel of food leftovers on a young boy chained in a dungeon, but before it could be used, the contents of the barrel had turned green with mold. The noxious mixture was dumped on the young boy anyway, and overnight the series had its trademark gag. The show subsequently went through several different slime recipes incorporating ingredients such as lime gelatin dessert powder, flour, oatmeal or Cream of Wheat, baby shampoo, and even cottage cheese (not all necessarily at the same time). On the show (and subsequently on Nickelodeon since then), the composition of the slime was treated as a closely guarded secret, and some episodes revolved around the cast members trying to discern what the slime was made of.\n\nToday gunge or slime features on many television shows around the world; however, since the 2000s the focus has changed from mainstream shows to children's and teenager's television programmes like Nickelodeon's \"Figure It Out\". In fact, thanks largely to the popularity of Nickelodeon shows, slime and gunge have typically been associated with children's programming in North America since the 1980s. In addition to its use on television and as a fundraiser, gunge in tanks sometimes features in nightclubs. Youth groups such as church groups and scouting movements also make use of gunge to \"gunge the leaders\" as well as the children.\n\nIn the UK the popular BBC show \"Not Only... But Also\" featured a closing sketch called \"Poet's Corner\" in which that week's guest would be challenged to an improvisational poetry contest against Peter Cook, with Dudley Moore acting as referee. Each contestant would sit at the corner of a square tank of \"BBC Gunge\" on a rigged seat that could be triggered so as to catapult the occupant into the tank. The referee would sit at one of the other corners in a similar chair. Any use of repetition, hesitation or deviation from the challenge theme would precipitate the offender into the tank. The sketch always ended with all three personalities in the tank, chest deep in slime and reciting poetry.\n\nThe UK Saturday morning children's show \"Tiswas\" used the concept of gunge in abundance. Having already established messy slapstick humour through custard pies and buckets of water being thrown over presenters and guests, Tiswas had taken to locking up adult volunteers into a cage. Once inside the cage, the inhabitants would normally be soaked with buckets of water at random points in the show. Where gunge became involved, was thanks to the tin bath perched on top the Cage. Through a handle, this tub could be tilted, dropping its messy contents onto the people below, While famous for its custard pie humour, it would not be unusual for Tiswas to have buckets of food and imitation mud/horse manure poured over people. Custard and baked beans were popular choices.\n\nIn North America, \"You Can't Do That on Television\", a Canadian children's show popular on Nickelodeon developed by a British TV producer, Roger Price, routinely subjected its characters to \"slime\" (usually green, but sometimes in other colours), usually when they said, \"I don't know.\" It became a staple of the show where other actors would try to encourage their peers to say a phrase to get them slimed. A sliming scene from a 1982 episode of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" was also used in the opening of the 1987 film \"Fatal Attraction\", and references to the series have been used in mainstream U.S. television series ranging from \"NewsRadio\" to \"Family Guy\". This aspect of the cult show later became iconized in Nickelodeon's slime logo, subsequent game shows such as \"Double Dare\", \"What Would You Do?\", \"Figure It Out\", and \"BrainSurge\" revolving around slime, pies in the face, and other forms of mess, and live events in which participants (including celebrities, particularly at the annual Kids' Choice Awards) would be offered the chance to get slimed or publicly humiliated. In the late 1980s, Nickelodeon and its Canadian counterpart, YTV, even held write-in contests in which the grand prize was a trip to the \"YCDTOTV\" set in Ottawa, Ontario, to be slimed. The popularity of Nickelodeon's slime shows spawned imitators such as the short-lived 1988 syndicated game show \"Slime Time\" (no relation to Nickelodeon's later \"Slime Time Live\"), in which schoolteachers were the victims of green gungings.\n\nIn Britain and Europe, in the early 1980s, children's gunge-based game shows were the norm. Particularly shows like \"How Dare You!\" on ITV and \"Crackerjack\" on the BBC ensured that the gunging element featured on shows for the decade to come. On \"How Dare You!\", one of the main games was 'Teach Them a Lesson', where children got the opportunity to drench their teacher or representative from their school in gunge while sitting above a knee deep filled gunge tank. After this game the teachers were sometimes knocked off their perch by one of show's presenters and into the gunge tank. On \"Crackerjack\", the two weekly celebrities, one male and one female, would compete against host Stu Francis in a gunge based gamed called \"Take A Chance\" to try to win points for their child contestant. Failure to answer questions correctly would lead to Francis and/or the celebrity guest being covered in gunge. Additionally, the male celebrity and Francis, even if they got a question correct would usually get gunged regardless as punishment for laughing at their opponent, although female contestants who answered correctly were generally allowed to laugh at Francis and get away with it.\n\nLater in the 1980s, the BBC launched \"Double Dare\", based on the US style format, but much sloppier than its U.S. counterpart. Also, gunge started to appear on mainstream shows such as \"Game for a Laugh\" on ITV and Noel Edmond's \"Saturday Roadshow\" on the BBC.\nOther countries in Europe also started to have gunge elements on mainstream shows. \"Un Dos Tres\" on TVE in Spain often had contestants throwing buckets of gunge at each other. Also, \"Donnerlippchen\", a television show in Germany, had many messy games; the climax of the show was dunking the team's suited boss in a dunk tank and pouring custard down inside every team members pair of boxer shorts.\n\nNew Zealand children's show \"What Now\" has used gunge over the years since its launch in 1981. As of 2015 the show is still broadcasting on channel 2 each Sunday morning from 8am. Various segments of the show using gunge include, tank of terror, gunge on the run, flushed away, frog in the bog and brain freeze.\n\nIn \"Noel's House Party\", the public often voted to determine which celebrities on the television show would be gunged in the Gunge Tank. In later years, the Gunge Tank became the Gunge Train, and celebrities were forced to take a ride on the train and were covered in gunge throughout their journey. Celebrities usually returned with their suits or dresses ruined and faces unrecognizable. Sometimes audience members were gunged on the show for reasons of revenge by family members or friends.\n\nThe entertainment factor attached to the process of gunging was realised by the producers of the charity event \"Comic Relief\", who held an event, in cooperation with the Guinness World Records at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham where an attempt to set a record for the Most People Gunged Simultaneously took place on March 12, 1999. 184 gallons of gunge was splattered over 731 people.\nAll across Europe television producers were ordering more gunge segments to be fitted into mainstream television shows due to its popularity with viewers. In Germany, on Sat.1, Halli galli, Glücksritter (RTL), Glücksspirale, plus the German version of NHP - Gottschalk's Haus-Party, all involved a high dose of gunge. Halli Galli had audience members plucked out of their seats and sent down a messy gunge slide and into a pool. Likewise, Glücksspirale on SAT1, Glücksritter RTL and Rache ist Süß Sat1, had contestants plucked out of the audience and gunged in the most spectacular ways.\nTowards the end of the 1990s, with the demise of \"Noel's House Party\" and the dwindling audience figures for other European shows, the gunge segment in many mainstream shows started to fade.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, gunge became a focal feature in many children's television shows. Teenagers and celebrity guests are often seen competing in quizzes on \"Live & Kicking\", and are gunged if they lose. Celebrities Lee Ryan, Ben Adams, Katy Hill, Lesley Waters, Katherine Merry, Heather Suttie and Victoria Hawkins were gunged on this show. Many other shows used gunge throughout - \"Fun House\", \"Get Your Own Back\", \"Run the Risk\" and \"Double Dare\".\n\nFrom 1997 to 2003, a Canadian show called Uh Oh! (game show), that ran on YTV, featured a punishment system that had the participant go inside a closet sized room and have green gunged dropped on them if their partner wasn't able to answer the question correctly.\n\nIn mainstream television programmes during the naughts, gunge was used in shows such as The Paul O'Grady Show, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and \"Insides Out\".\n\nGunge continues to feature in 2010 on children's TV in the UK and continuing the trend of the latter half of the 2000s, not as much as it once did. 101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow has used it in its Bonus Round. The host picks a random name and the first person to get the question he asks wrong gets lowered down a pipe and gets gunged. Wait For It and Keep Your Enemies Close. Basilchildren's Swap Shop returned minus the gunge gallery but introducing a new game with a western theme called Gold Rush. In this game, the two winning teams from the previous game (dunk beds) take part in the game set in a mine shaft where the aim is to fill up tubes with liquid sludge by tipping buckets with the slop into the tubes which are hidden (so the children do not know who is winning). At the end the four kids take cover in the now shuddering mine shaft. The winning team then receives gold (yellow gunge) while the losing team were initially covered in brown sludge however later episodes they remain dry.\n\nIn New Zealand kids television, What Now introduced a new gungey game the big breakfast and Splat Cave. Fe Fi Fo Yum has a challenge which sees two children go barefoot into a bowl of gunge to collect objects for their teammates such as letters/numbers or other items. The final game also makes use of the gunge bowl, where the last part involves wading in the pool and up a ramp in order to release their captive teammates. In 2014, a few new games such as Use Ya Head, Target Ya Teacher and Small Balls were added to What Now. In addition, the spin-off from Horrible Histories, involved a physical challenge involving gunge. The three children in the quiz running barefoot across an inflatable collecting \"poo\" and depositing it in their tanks at the other end. Above the inflatable are three containers - one for each lane of the inflatable, storing gunge which is released at points in the game. A variation of this challenge sees the three contestants again running barefoot along an inflatable lane, in an all play game, throw pies into mouths attached to a bungee cord, in the second series, this has the added difficulty of \"Garum sauce\" falling onto the inflatable at a random point in the game causing the children to slip and slide thus increasing the difficulty of the challenge. As of series 3 the losing kids would go down a slide barefoot into a vat of brown gunge and have to crawl through it.. The British and Australian versions of Nickelodeon's Camp Orange also features challenges which involve getting gunged. Splatalot (in Dutch Spetterslot), a medieval themed game show, similar to Total Wipeout features gunge/slime is fired at the attackers by the defenders at random points in the challenges as a means to slow down the attackers.\n\nSam and Mark Big Friday Wind Up has started featuring gunge since 2014. The game was called rotation and two family teams were asked general knowledge questions while a gunge tank is being poured into, if they get the question right they spin and it is the other family's turn to answer a question. The team that is under the gunge when it is full gets gunged.\n\nIn 2016, rotation was replaced by another gungey game called Splat in the box. Two family teams were asked general knowledge questions. However many seconds they took to answer the question is however many turns they do on the handle on the box. for example if they took 3 seconds to answer they will have to turn the crank 3 times. if they get a question wrong or run out of time they will have to do the maximum of turns which is 10. A gunge monster was hiding in the box and a certain number of turns will open the box and whichever team is standing in front of the box gets gunged.\n\n7two had a new gameshow with gunge in called Flushed. The losers of the previous round went into a gunge tank and got gunged with purple gunge or \"Sludge\" as they call it in the show. There were 2 rounds so each episode contained 2 gungings unless there was a tie in one of the rounds so that it was just one gunging.\n\nIn terms of prime time television, in the UK at least, gunge has made appearances in the ITV1 game show The Whole 19 Yards where two transparent spheres contained either pink or yellow gunge. In one of the many physical challenges, a contestant had to unscrew the bottom of the sphere of their colour resulting in the gunge falling onto them and the floor below in order to retrieve a key in the sphere which allowed them to complete the challenge. The Channel 5 version of Big Brother (both celebrity and normal version) features gunge in various tasks and as a way to nominate housemates.\n\nAt the 2014 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards, the Legend Award was given to soccer player David Beckham, who was slimed with gold slime rather than the traditional green. Baseball player Derek Jeter, who received the award the following year, was also slimed with a gold color. This tradition has continued with Kobe Bryant in 2016, Michael Phelps in 2017, and Danica Patrick in 2018. This sliming is notable not only for its unique gold look, but for the overwhelming fashion in which the individuals are covered with slime.\n"}
{"id": "2066350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066350", "title": "Bundesautobahn 2", "text": "Bundesautobahn 2\n\nThe A 2 was modified in the late 1990s, and completely rebuilt in the former East Germany. All of the A 2 has 3 travel lanes and a breakdown lane in each direction. \n\nThe highway was planned between September 1933 and December 1934 by the construction departments of the company Reichsautobahn in Dusseldorf, Hanover and Merseburg. As a connection of the Rhine-Ruhr region, the highway was deliberately planned in the northern area of the Ruhr area, since the mining migrated to the north and at the same time wanted to avoid the mountain subsidence areas. In the area Ostwestfalen one followed the settlement priorities. In the area of Hanover, it was natural to pass the motorway via a short route south of the city. As Hanover was at that time one of the hubs of German air traffic and the airport was in the north of the city, it was decided, however, for a northern bypass of the city. In addition, there was a freight yard in the north, an industrial area was planned and the soil conditions were better. Between Berlin and Hanover there were three possible variants, which were examined. The northern one was supposed to lead over Stendal and to the north to the Berliner Ring. It was the shortest route for the proposed extension in the direction of Szczecin and Königsberg dar. However, the disadvantage was that the crossed area was sparsely populated and already the railroad was the main carrier. The middle variant touched Genthin and Brandenburg on the Havel and aimed at the center of Berlin. Again, the area was sparsely populated and already developed by the railway. Another difficulty was that there were numerous lakes and bogs, which would have made construction difficult. The southern variant, which was finally built, led through the most densely populated area and opened the possibility of an extension to Wroclaw or Frankfurt (Oder) and Warsaw. It was planned to build two 3.75 m wide lanes per direction of travel with a 4.2 m wide median strip along the entire route. With the Betonleitstreifen and the banquets, the construction had a width of 24 m. It was laid out, with the exception of the section in the Teutoburg Forest, for speeds of at least 160 km / h.\n\nThe construction was carried out in parallel with the total of 12 locations. First, on April 5, 1936, the 32 km section between Braunschweig-West and Lehrte was opened to traffic. Three further sections between Hannover-Ost to Lehrte (10 km), Braunschweig-West to Helmstedt (43 km) and Werder / Groß Kreutz (located at the subsequent part of today's A 10) to Burg / Schermen (85 km) followed on 17 August 1936. On January 10, 1937, the Berlin Ring was connected to Hannover with the release of the 55 km long section between Burg / Schermen and Helmstedt. In 1937, the first section between Dusseldorf and Recklinghausen was opened in the western area on 17 December. The Kamener cross northeast of Dortmund, where the A 1 crosses the A 2, was on 12 November 1938, together with the section between Recklinghausen and Gütersloh the traffic passed, but still without the subsequent parts of today's A 1, the only after 1945 were put into operation. It was after the Schkeuditzer cross (A 9-A 14) a second intersection in cloverleaf execution in Germany. The also scheduled for this day traffic transfer of the section between Gütersloh and Bielefeld could not be performed due to a landslide in the Teutoburg Forest. Only after the damage had been eliminated on 15 December, you could drive this route. On the same day, the section was inaugurated until Bad Salzuflen and Herford. The day before, the section between Bad Nenndorf and Hannover had already been opened. Thus, only the section between Bad Salzuflen and Bad Nenndorf was missing. This was released on 23 September 1939 restricted. Due to the started World War II you could finish this section only once. Thus, this was provisionally intended only for the so-called service traffic. Under the operation of Polish forced laborers and prisoners of war, this section was built and opened until November 14, 1940, except for a three-kilometer stretch of the Weser crossing at Bad Oeynhausen, which was built after the war. Altogether 230 bridges were built in the course of the highway.\n\nIn the GDR, the highway was one of the transit routes, from 1971 in the context of the transit agreement. On a travel and traffic map of the GDR of 1979, the section of the highway between the border crossing Marienborn and the former branch Magdeburg (now motorway junction Werder) is only marked with a T for transit route, on a later map (Reiseland DDR 1988) with the until today applicable addition E 30 for European road. It played an important role as a transit corridor to West Berlin, with allied checkpoints at Helmstedt and Dreilinden-Drewitz (on the A 10) respectively.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1970s prepared numbering scheme of the federal highways carried the current A 2 in the former West Germany largely their current number, but ran west of the cross Oberhausen on the way of today's A 3 on to the motorway junction Heumar, the Berliner Ring coming Kilometrierung was even continued in a westerly direction to Aachen. From the introduction of today's numbering system in 1975, the A 2 already began at the Dutch border Straelen / Venlo and led from the intersection Kaiserberg together as A 2 and A 3 to the cross Oberhausen, where the A 3 in the direction of Arnhem again separated from the route. In the course of the numbering of the junctions, which began in 1992, double denominations of motorway junctions, motorway junctions and dual denominations such as the route between Duisburg and Oberhausen were classified as A 2 / A 3. The piece between Venlo and Duisburg is today part of the A 40.\n\nBetween the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn one can still see the former border control points, which were turned into a museum in the 1990s.\nThe Dortmund-Lanstrop junction has only been built to give access to the nearby landfill. Garbage trucks approach it via the autobahn, then exit via secondary roads. The landfill is easily recognizable by the Lanstroper Ei, an old water tower standing on a hill approximately away from the autobahn.\n\nDue to its importance as a major thoroughfare for commercial transit and as a trade route connecting the western parts of Germany to neighbouring Central European countries such as Poland, it is often nicknamed \"Warsaw Avenue\" or simply \"Poland Highway\".\n\nChristian Dzida, keyboardist for the Austrian band Schürzenjäger from 1995 to 1999, was killed in a road accident on Bundesautobahn 2 in November 2009.\n\nThe A 2 is completely six-lane between the Ruhr area and Berlin. The last gap of several years of expansion was closed in mid-December 2011. During the long expansion phase, it came again and again to miles of traffic jams. Despite extensive security measures, there were always numerous serious rear-end collisions involving trucks.\n\nAt the end of October 2013, after 18 months of construction, the tank and service facility \"Lipperland Nord\" north of the junction Ostwestfalen / Lippe opened. The rest stop Lipperland Süd was already completed.\n\nLower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia want to expand the busy A 2 from Bielefeld to the border to Saxony-Anhalt eight lanes. In order to meet the expected increase in traffic, especially of trucks on the important east-west connection, both countries had notified the expansion for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030. However, the final version of the corresponding demand plan, which came into force at the end of 2016 with the amendment of the Highway Act, now only includes the extension of the motorway triangle Bottrop and Hannover-West, the motorway junction Hannover-Buchholz and the eight-lane extension from Herrenhausen to AD Hannover-West as urgent needs with bottleneck elimination. Further needs are the eight-lane expansion of the sections Bad Nenndorf to Herrenhausen and Hannover-West to Hannover-East classified.\n\nOn the approximately 3.5-kilometer section between the interchange Hannover-Ost and Lehrte the side strips were equipped with emergency stop bays, structurally adapted and sold with block marking and released since January 28 in the direction of Berlin and February 1 in the opposite direction as Verflechtungsstreifen. Traffic is routed there via LED panels and supplemented variable message signs.\n\n<br>\n"}

He is best known as the co-creator of Supergirl and for his many scripts for \"\" and other stories involving the entire superhero Marvel Family. He was prolific in the comic book field and is credited with writing over 4400 stories across a variety of publishers under his own name, as well as more than 160 stories under the pen-name Eando Binder.\n\nBorn in Bessemer, Michigan, Otto Binder was the youngest of six children born into a German-Lutheran family that had emigrated from Austria a year earlier. They settled in Chicago in 1922, during a period rich with science fiction, which enthralled Binder and his brother Earl. The two began writing in partnership and sold their first story, \"The First Martian\" to \"Amazing Stories\" in 1930; it saw publication in 1932 under the pen name \"Eando Binder\" (\"E\" and \"O\" Binder).\n\nNot earning enough as a writer to live on, Binder and his brother worked at many jobs. Earl found employment at an iron works. In late December 1935, Otto Binder began working for Otis Adelbert Kline as a literary agent in charge of Kline's New York City office most prominently marketing the stories of Robert E. Howard, although insufficient business during this Great Depression era forced Kline to close his company after a year and a half. At the time of Otto's move to New York City, Earl Binder dissolved the writing partnership, and all new material produced under the name of Eando Binder from January 1936 on, was solely the work of Otto Binder. Concurrent with his agent work, Binder was writing for Mort Weisinger, editor of \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", and Ray Palmer, editor of \"Amazing\", for the latter of whom he created the Adam Link series\n\nBinder entered comics in 1939 on the heels of his artist brother, Jack, who moved to New York to work at the studio of Harry \"A\" Chesler, one of that era's \"packagers\" who provided outsourced content for publishers entering the new medium of comic books. The following year, magazine publisher Fawcett Publications began its Fawcett Comics line, and Binder started writing the exploits of such characters as Captain Venture, Golden Arrow, Bulletman and El Carim. After a year, editor Ed Herron had Binder tackle Fawcett's most prominent character, the superhero Captain Marvel. He soon wrote for the spin-off features starring Captain Marvel, Jr. and Mary Marvel, the latter of whom he co-created with Marc Swayze.\n\nBinder spent from 1941 to 1953 with Fawcett, writing \"986 stories ... out of 1,743, over half the entire Marvel Family saga\", per comic-book writer-editor E. Nelson Bridwell. His first Captain Marvel writing was the \"Dime Action Book\" novel \"Return of the Scorpion\", featuring the villain from the 1941 Republic serial \"The Adventures of Captain Marvel\". His first Captain Marvel comic-book story was \"Captain Marvel Saves the King\" in \"Captain Marvel Adventures\" #9 (April 1942). He wrote for numerous other Fawcett features, as well as many two-page text fillers that were required in comics in order to be eligible for magazine postal rates. His text stories in \"Captain Marvel Adventures\", under the \"Eando\" pseudonym, starred Lieutenant Jon Jarl of the Space Patrol. During his time at Fawcett, Binder co-created with Swayze and C. C. Beck such characters as Mary Marvel, Uncle Dudley, Mr. Tawky Tawny, Black Adam and Mr. Mind, as well as two of Doctor Sivana's four children: the evil teens Thaddeus Sivana Jr. and daughter Georgia. Binder and Beck unsuccessfully attempted to launch a newspaper comic strip featuring Mr. Tawky Tawny in 1953.\n\nBinder left Fawcett when the company shut down its comic book division in 1953, but found no shortage of work. For Timely Comics, the 1940s company that would evolve into Marvel Comics, he [co-]created Captain Wonder, the Young Allies, Tommy Tyme and the patriotically themed superheroine Miss America, and wrote for stories starring Captain America, the Human Torch, the Sub-Mariner, the Destroyer, the Whizzer, and the All-Winners Squad.\n\nFor Quality Comics, Binder co-created Kid Eternity, and wrote Blackhawk, Doll Man, Uncle Sam and Black Condor stories. For MLJ Comics (subsequently known as Archie Comics), he wrote stories starring Steel Sterling, the Shield, the Hangman, and the Black Hood. At Gold Key Comics, Binder co-created Mighty Samson and other characters. His science fiction for EC Comics includes \"Lost in Space\", illustrated by Al Williamson, in \"Weird Science-Fantasy\" #28 (March–April 1955).\n\nIn 1948, Binder began working for DC Comics, then known as National Periodical Publications, swiftly creating Merry, Girl of 1,000 Gimmicks, in the feature \"Star-Spangled Kid\", whose place Merry soon took in \"Star-Spangled Comics\".\n\nHe then moved on to his best-known DC work, the Superman group of titles, including launching the \"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\" series in 1954. Binder and artist Al Plastino collaborated on the Superboy story in \"Adventure Comics\" #247 (April 1958) that introduced the Legion of Super-Heroes, a teen superhero team from the future that eventually became one of DC's most popular features. Binder and Plastino debuted the supervillain Brainiac and the Bottle City of Kandor in \"Action Comics\" #242 (July 1958) and co-created Supergirl in \"Action Comics\" #252 (May 1959). With various artist collaborators, he co-created Krypto the Super Dog, the Phantom Zone, and the supporting characters Lucy Lane, Beppo the Super Monkey, and Titano the Super Ape. In the first issue of \"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\", he introduced Jimmy Olsen's signal-watch, and in #31, Jimmy's Elastic Lad identity. He wrote the Lois Lane feature in \"Showcase\" #9 (Aug. 1957) which served as a tryout for the character's own series.\n\nDC writer-editor E. Nelson Bridwell credits Binder as creating the first \"Imaginary Tale, for Lois Lane,\" and of writing \"most of the early\" Bizarro stories, including at least the first \"Tales of the Bizarro World\" feature. The character's first comic book appearance was in \"Superboy\" #68 (Oct. 1958) by Binder and artist George Papp and Bizarro World was introduced in \"Action Comics\" #263 (April 1960). Binder scripted what Bridwell calls the \"classic [storyline] 'Superman's Return to Krypton.'\" His last Superman story was \"The Cage of Doom\" in \"Action Comics\" #377 (June 1969).\n\nBinder was featured in a story in the first issue of \"Shazam\", DC Comics' 1970s revival of the original Captain Marvel. The Binder character, drawn by C. C. Beck, meets a young Billy Batson and is astonished that the boy, who has been missing for 20 years, is still a kid.\n\nBinder was a proponent of the ancient astronauts theory, and a believer in extraterrestrial life. Binder's theory is that human beings are \"homo hybrid\" an \"interstellar crossbreed\" (half human, half extraterrestrial). He first discussed this hypothesis in his 1968 book \"Flying Saucers Are Watching Us\" (later called \"Unsolved Mysteries of the Past\", Tower Publications; reissue edition, 1970). He wrote \"Mankind Child of the Stars\" with Max Flindt in 1974, discussing the concept of \"astroevolution\". Erich von Däniken wrote a foreword for the book, which was revised and reprinted in 1999. He wrote extensively about UFOs in magazines, including articles detailing the experiences of claimed UFO contactee Ted Owens.\n\nBinder became editor of \"Space World\" magazine, a move that ended in bankruptcy in the early 1960s. As he recalled in 1974:\n\nOtto Binder's daughter Mary, had been on her way to school one morning when a car jumped the curb, went into the driveway in front of the school and killed her. As film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan, a family friend, recalled, \"Otto never recovered. His wife never recovered. She had a breakdown, and Otto started drinking, and eventually he dropped dead of a heart attack. And the three of them were gone, like in a flash.\" Binder recalled in a 1972 history of comics, that after his daughter's death\n\nIn 1973, Binder worked for Vincent Fago's Pendulum Press, adapting classic science-fiction stories into comic book format, including \"Frankenstein\", \"The Invisible Man\", \"The Time Machine\", \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" and \"The Mysterious Island\".\n\nHe died in Chestertown, New York, on October 13, 1974, leaving behind, counted Bridwell, \"almost 50,000 pages of comics\" comprising \"over 1,300 scripts for Fawcett\" and \"more than 2,000 for 20 other publishers\", including \"some 93 heroes in 198 magazines.\"\n\nBinder was posthumously inducted into the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 2004. He was the posthoumous recipient of the Bill Finger Award in 2010.\n\nBinder is referenced in the first episode of the 2015 television series \"Supergirl\" as the title character prevents a crippled jet from crashing into the \"Otto Binder bridge.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for creating the Fawcett Comics character, Captain Marvel, in 1939, along with artist C. C. Beck.\n\nParker was born in East Orange, New Jersey. He graduated in 1929 from The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, and then attended Princeton University, where he was a member of the Cannon Club, Press Club and ROTC. After graduating from Princeton in 1933 with a degree in English Literature, Parker worked for three years for the \"New York Herald Tribune\" as a sports editor and in the education department, followed by a year as sports editor of the \"Literary Digest\". \n\nIn September 1937 Parker joined Fawcett Publications, initially as an editor on its crime and detective magazines and then as an editor on its movie magazine line. He stayed in this role until August 1939, when he was asked to become the senior editor of a new comic book line that Fawcett intended to bring to market.\n\nAfter agreeing to take on the comic book project, Parker was assigned the task of creating the characters and stories for Fawcett's first comic magazine, \"Whiz Comics\". For the lead character, Parker developed a superhero that he initially named \"Captain Thunder,\" later changed to \"Captain Marvel\" at the suggestion of Fawcett General Manager Ralph Daigh. Parker originally conceived Captain Marvel as a leader of a group of men, each of whom possessed one outstanding characteristic, and who would be called upon by the leader as the needs of each mission demanded. This concept was inspired by stories of the Knights of the Round Table that Parker had read as a boy in James Baldwin's 1910 book \"Stories of the King.\" Fawcett's Daigh, however, was against the idea of a group, so Parker decided to combine all of the outstanding characteristics of the group into a single character. He drew these characteristics from six mythological heroes - Solomon, Hercules, Achilles, Zeus, Atlas and Mercury - and used the first letter of each as an acrostic for the word \"Shazam.\" \n\nAfter Parker had fully developed Captain Marvel's character and backstory, artist Clarence \"C.C.\" Beck was brought in to flesh out the character's look, to which Parker contributed the ideas for the Hessian cape and the lightning bolt logo. Captain Marvel's first appearance was in Whiz Comics #2, which went on sale in December 1939.\n\nIn addition to co-creating Captain Marvel, Parker also co-created the other Fawcett characters that debuted in \"Whiz Comics #2\", including Ibis the Invincible (with C.C. Beck), Golden Arrow (with Pete Costanza), Spy Smasher (with C.C. Beck), Scoop Smith (with Greg Duncan), Lance O'Casey (with Bob Kingett) and Dan Dare (with Greg Duncan).\n\nAt the time he created Captain Marvel, Parker was a member of the cavalry in the New York National Guard, and in October 1940 left Fawcett to join the U.S. Army in active service. He served in the Pacific theater during World War II, rising to the rank of Major. \n\nFollowing World War II, he rejoined Fawcett Publications in December 1945, but had no further involvement in comics. From 1945 to 1948 he was the feature editor of \"Today's Woman\", before becoming the senior editor of \"Mechanix Illustrated\", a position he held until his death in 1963. \n\nParker was survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Hennig, and two step-daughters. Parker's only child, William Lee Parker Jr., died in infancy in 1949.\n\n"}

He was best known for his work on Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family during both the Golden Age and Bronze Age of comics, as well as his work on the title \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\" during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nSchaffenberger was born on a farm in the Thuringian Forest, Germany, where, as a boy, he \". . . tended geese, herded goats, and hoed potatoes.\" Emigrating to America as a 7-year-old, first to Hartford, Connecticut, and then to New York City, he eventually won a scholarship to the Pratt Institute. After graduation, he joined Jack Binder's studio in 1941, where he worked on key Fawcett titles including \"Captain Marvel\", \"Bulletman\", and \"Ibis the Invincible\".\n\nWhile working for Binder's studio, which was located in Englewood, New Jersey, Schaffenberger took over an apartment from the local high school football coach, Vince Lombardi, who had yet to achieve success in the National Football League.\n\nDuring this time, Schaffenberger's work was also published by Prize, Street & Smith, and Pines.\n\nSchaffenberger served in the U.S. military during World War II, including a stint with the Office of Strategic Services, leaving the military with the rank of Master Sergeant.\n\nSchaffenberger returned to the world of professional sequential art soon after war's end. He resumed his work for the Captain Marvel family of titles, and expanded his reach to an even more diverse group of publishing houses, including EC Comics, Gilberton, Premier Magazines, American Comics Group, and Marvel Comics.\nAt Gilberton, Schaffenberger provided the interior art for \"Classics Illustrated\" No. 119, \"Soldiers of Fortune\" (May 1954).\n\nIn 1957 Otto Binder recruited Schaffenberger to DC to work on the Superman family. He stayed at DC for the next 30 years, making an especially large contribution to the development of Lois Lane. In this capacity, he was the lead artist on the \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\" series for the entirety of its first decade. Indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lane became cited by many as the \"definitive\" version of the character, and Schaffenberger was often asked by DC editor Mort Weisinger to redraw other artists' depictions of Lois Lane in other DC titles where she appeared. Catwoman made her first appearance in the Silver Age of Comic Books in \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\" #70 (Nov. 1966) in a story drawn by Schaffenberger. In issue #80 (Jan. 1968), Schaffenberger updated the character's fashions to a then-more contemporary look.\n\nHe was essentially fired from DC in 1970 for helping to organize other artists to protest bad working conditions. He then briefly freelanced and worked for Marvel, but returned to DC in 1972.\n\nWhen, in the 1970s, DC acquired the rights to the Marvel Family, Schaffenberger was one of the key players in the revival of those characters. The late 1970s saw him contribute outside the Superman family of titles, including work on titles such as \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Super Friends\".\n\nIn 1980, Schaffenberger was again leading a Superman family title, \"The New Adventures of Superboy\", the final, post-\"Legion\" title for the original Superboy. Somewhat metaphorically, the Superboy- and Supergirl-less DC universe that followed the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" turned out to be a mostly Schaffenberger-less one as well. He largely retired from comics soon after helping with the final pre-\"Crisis\" Superman tale \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\"\n\nSchaffenberger was a special guest at the 1996 San Diego Comic Con.\n\nSchaffenberger and his wife, the former Dorothy Bates Watson, who married in Englewood, New Jersey, on March 30, 1946, had two children, Susan and her three-years-younger brother, Karl. The family lived for four decades in the same house in River Edge, New Jersey, before moving in 1989.\n\nSchaffenberger's work won him the 1984 National Cartoonists Society Award in the \"Comic Book\" division.

He was the co-creator of Mary Marvel, along with writer Otto Binder. The first Mary Marvel character sketches came from Swayze's drawing table, and he illustrated her earliest adventures, including the classic origin story, \"Captain Marvel Introduces Mary Marvel\" (\"Captain Marvel Adventures\" #18, Dec. 1942).\n\nSwayze was born to Louis Herbert and Mildred (née Turner) Swayze. He graduated from Neville High School in his native Monroe, Louisiana. He attended the Northeast Center of LSU (now University of Louisiana at Monroe) before receiving his degree from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He subsequently procured a Master of Fine Arts degree from Northeast Louisiana University (now ULM) where he also taught art.\n\nSwayze was hired primarily by Fawcett to illustrate Captain Marvel stories and covers for \"Whiz Comics\" and \"Captain Marvel Adventures\". He wrote many Captain Marvel scripts and continued to do so while he served in the United States Army, which he entered at Fort Oglethorpe in north Georgia during World War II. He played guitar and performed twice with Bing Crosby entertaining troops.\n\nAfter leaving the military in 1944, he made an arrangement with Fawcett to produce art and stories on a freelance basis from his home in Monroe, where he created both art and storylines for \"The Phantom Eagle\" (Wow Comics), as well as drawing the \"Flyin' Jenny\" newspaper strip for Bell Syndicate (created by Russell Keaton). \nAfter Wow Comics ceased publication, Swayze produced artwork for Fawcett's top-selling line of romance comics, including \"Sweethearts\" and \"Life Story\". After the company ceased publishing comics, Swayze switched to Charlton Publications, from which he ended his comics career in the middle 1950s. He was then hired by Olin Matheson to establish the art department for the company's packaging division.\n\nIn an interview in 2000 with the \"Monroe News Star\", Swayze describe his philosophy of developing comics as the utilization of \"art in storytelling so that even a child who couldn't yet read could get a story out of it.\" An oil painter and former semi-professional league baseball player, Swayze wrote a column containing his memoirs, carried in \"Alter Ego\" magazine, from 1996 until his death, under the title, \"We Didn't Know It Was the Golden Age!\"\n\nSwayze and his wife, the former June Bloomer, reared five children in Monroe. He was elected to the Ouachita Parish School Board, and was vice commander of the American Legion.\n\nHe died October 14, 2012 in Monroe at age 99. In addition to his wife of 66 years, he was survived by his three daughters, a son, and four grandchildren. The fifth child is not mentioned by name in the obituary, presumably having predeceased his or her parents. Services were held on October 17, 2012, at the First United Methodist Church of Monroe.

The album's title name comes from the lyrics of \"Outside the Boundaries of a Friend\", \"My heart, once nourished with hope and compassion, now is black as death.\"\n\nMany movie samples were used. One of them is played at the end of \"Solely Concentrating on the Negative Aspects of Life\", in which Bill Murray is heard saying \"It's gonna be cold. It's gonna be gray. And it's gonna last you for the rest of your life\" from the 1993 film \"Groundhog Day\".

She is more than ready to hand the responsibilities of the household over to her younger brother's new wife; however, the keep is attacked during the wedding feast and the bride, Dierna, is kidnapped. With her father dead and her brother badly wounded, Kerowyn goes to her grandmother, the sorceress Kethryveris, for help. Kethry presents Kerowyn with her magical sword Need, and Kerowyn rides after the bandits herself, successfully rescuing Dierna in an event later immortalized in a song called \"Kerowyn's Ride.\"\n\nFollowing the rescue, Kerowyn finds that she is both a hero and an embarrassment to her brother. She soon leaves to live with Kethry and her partner Tarma, becoming Tarma's student in the arts of warfare, and learning to control her mind-magic from Tarma's kyree companion Warrl. In the course of her training Kerowyn meets Darenthallis, third son of the king of Rethwellan and another of Tarma's students; after a period of mutual antagonism, the two of them eventually become friends, and then lovers, but when Daren's father dies and his older brother takes the throne, Kerowyn refuses to go with him to Rethwellan. Instead, upon completing her training with Tarma, Kerowyn joins the mercenary company known as the Skybolts.\n\nKerowyn remains with the Skybolts for several years, growing in skill and in standing within the company. During a campaign against Karse, Kerowyn ends up separated from the rest of the company and flees into Karse. There, she encounters a group of Karsites who have captured and are planning to torture the Herald Eldan; securing Eldan's promise to pay her for it, she rescues him from the Karsites. The two quickly fall in love, but when Kerowyn realizes that the Karsites are tracking Need's presence, she sneaks away in the night, drawing the Karsites away and leaving Eldan to make his way back to Valdemar while she returns to the Skybolts. Upon her return, after a confrontation with the Skybolt's selfish captain, Kerowyn is made Captain of the Skybolts.\n\nTen years pass. The Skybolts are a formidable company under Kerowyn, and they win a decisive battle for Rethwellan against Karse. Kerowyn again meets Daren, who takes her to the Rethwellan court. While Kerowyn is at the court, Herald Talia and Herald Dirk arrive, seeking aid from Rethwellan. Prince Ancar of Hardorn is making war against Valdemar, using men controlled by magic as soldiers. Valdemar has no experience with magic, and more importantly, they do not have a large enough army. Kerowyn volunteers the Skybolts as an advance force, while Rethwellan promises a second force with Daren to follow.\n\nIn Valdemar, Kerowyn is reunited with Eldan, whom she has been unable to forget. But Ancar's forces seem limitless, and Kerowyn was unable to bring her own mages across the Valdemar border. The Skybolts sympathize with Valdemar, however, and the forces prepare for a final stand. As the battle joins, Daren arrives with the Rethwellan army and a number of Ancar's soldiers, now freed from the controlling spell. Ancar's troops are defeated, and both Kerowyn and Daren are Chosen by Companions in the chaos of the battle, making them Heralds. The Skybolts are given a border town in Valdemar to use as a home base, in gratitude for their assistance, and Kerowyn is able to remain in Valdemar, fulfilling her duties as both a Captain and a Herald.\n"}

Temerloh has been proved that it is \"The Centre Of Peninsular Malaysia\" (Malay: Temerloh Titik Tengah Semenanjung Malaysia)T3S which actually situated at Kampung Paya Siput, Lanchang.[4]\nLocated about from Kuala Lumpur along the Kuantan–Kuala Lumpur trunk road , Temerloh is the second largest town in Pahang after Kuantan, the state capital. It is situated at the junction of the Pahang River and the Semantan River. Today, \"Temerloh\" usually refers to the territory under the administration of Temerloh Municipal Council which includes Mentakab, Lanchang, Kuala Krau and Kerdau.\n\nAn old town with some colonial buildings and shop houses, the town has prospered in recent years as a transport hub and new industrial centre. There have been many new commercial and industrial hub built in Temerloh in recent years. Cutting travel time in half, the newly completed East Coast Expressway links the town to Kuala Lumpur and Kuantan and adds to the growth of Temerloh.\n\nTemerloh has been proved that it is \"The Centre Of Peninsular Malaysia\" () which actually situated at Kampung Paya Siput, Lanchang.\n\nThe town is once called \"Kuala Semantan\" as it situated at Semantan River's confluence. The name Temerloh was derived from the Malay word \"mereloh\" meaning sleep. It is said that \"Temerloh\" came about when a group of Minangkabau settlers, who came to settle at the place, noticed an Orang Asli (aborigine) who slept (\"mereloh\") all through the day without a care in the world. Perhaps as a mark of amazement on such lazy conduct and perhaps for lack of other names to give, or probably just in jest, he then called his settlement there as \"Temerloh\". Another more plausible theory claims the town's name is derived from the sleep place of orang asli which is called \"Tempat Mereloh\". As the word \"Tempat Mereloh\" is hard to pronounce, the Minangkabau settlers shortened it to \"Temerloh\" as it is easier to pronounce.\n\nAccording to Haji Zakaria Hitam, the modern-day Temerloh developed from a small settlement called Kuala Semantan. Kuala Semantan was actually a small old village at the bank of Semantan River. According to the folk story, the name \"Semantan\" came from the word \"Seman Tahan\". Osman, or \"Seman Tahan\" as the villagers called him, is a Bruneian settled at the small river connected to Pahang River. He mastered the martial art of Silat, thus many people came all the way and settled here to learn silat from him. As \"Seman Tahan\" became popular among the villagers, they named the river \"Seman Tahan River\". Thus, the town near the river was called \"Kuala Seman Tahan\" (\"Kuala\" in Malay means river confluence). The name \"Seman Tahan\" gradually becomes \"Semantan\".\n\nThe Temerloh district, on the other hand was established on July 1, 1889, when J. P. Rodger, the first Pahang Resident divided Pahang state into six smaller administration areas (districts): Pekan, Rompin, Kuala Pahang, Kuantan, Temerloh and Hulu Pahang. The capital of Temerloh district then (1 July 1889) was Kuala Semantan. As Kuala Semantan begin to develop rapidly, the name Kuala Semantan was thought unsuitable as the \"kuala\" only refers to the river confluence. Hence, Kuala Semantan changed its name to Temerloh. Before the British colonization, Temerloh was governed by several headvillagers (Village level) and \"Orang Besar\" (dignitaries) under the Pahang's administration of the \"Orang Besar System\". The Temerloh's people (then) were mainly Malay and Orang Asli, however there were also small groups of Chinese and Arabs there.\n\nThe following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.\n\nTemerloh is well connected to Kuala Lumpur and Kuantan via the East Coast Expressway and the Karak Expressway. These expressways also link Temerloh to other major towns in Pahang such as Maran, Karak and Bentong. The new state-of-the-art Hospital Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah serves as the main hospital in Central Pahang apart from Hospital Mentakab and Hospital Jengka. To cater to all kinds of sports activities such as athletics and field games, Temerloh Stadium was built and is usually fully utilized during the weekends. There are many shopping places in Temerloh: The Store, Lurah Semantan, Seri Semantan, Bazaar Temerloh, and others. The East Coast Expressway project includes the Sultan Ahmad Shah II Bridge in Temerloh. It crosses the Pahang River, the longest river in west Malaysia.\n\nHotel Green Park, one of the best hotels in Temerloh, is the tallest building in the town.\n\nTemerloh Mini Stadium is home to match Malaysia Premier League and FAM Cup League Malaysia for the team Pahang FA and Shahzan Muda FC\n\nTemerloh has been proved that it is \"The Centre Of Peninsular Malaysia\" (Malay: Titik Tengah Semenanjung Malaysia) which actually situated at Kampung Paya Siput, Lanchang.Temerloh town sits at the confluence of the Pahang and Semantan Rivers, which is why it is rich with freshwater fish such as Patin (silver catfish), Jelawat, Baung, Tenggalan, Lampam, Belida, Tilapia and Kerai. As the home of the Patin fish, the Temerloh folks have special dishes that bring out the best taste of the fish. Besides, a visit to the Sunday Bazaar \"Pekan Sehari\" is not to be missed. Located along the town's riverside, \"Pekan Sehari\" is a place where all kinds of goods and commodities can be found and sold at a reasonable price. In fact this \"Pekan Sehari\" is said to be the longest and biggest in the whole of Pahang. The sellers normally come by riverboat early in the morning, and take their place before the customers arrive about 7:00 in the morning. Sunday mornings are busy when boats come and go ferrying passengers and goods to the \"Pekan Sehari\".\n\nApart from its variety of fish, the town of Temerloh also offers a variety of jungle and wild-life experiences. The Kuala Krau Wildlife Reserve, a virgin forest reserve with untouched flora and fauna, is also where you can find the Kuala Gandah Elephant Conservation Centre and the Seladang Breeding Center. Gunung Senyum Recreational Forest, a paradise for nature and cave lovers is just about away. Located at Bukit Rengit, Lanchang, the Deerland Park is where you can learn not only about deer, feed and touch them, but also other animals such as ostrich, peacock, tuna deer, nilga deer (India) and wood-duck (Canada). Home to the albino monkey, porcupine, black leopard, civet, the Malayan gharial crocodile and alligators, the town's mini zoo covers over of land, and is located at Jalan Bahagia, near Kampung Sungai Rabit. There's also a recreational park located right in the middle of Temerloh town, behind the Courthouse, called \"Taman Bandar\" (Town Park). Among the facilities provided here are skate-board track, playground, jogging trails and a mini stadium.\n\nBy road \nThe old Kuala Lumpur–Kuantan federal highway is the main route serving downtown Temerloh; though motorists now prefer the LPT which links Temerloh all the way to Kuantan and then to Kuala Terengganu. Mentakab is linked to Temerloh by highway . Temerloh is the northern end of Highway which begins in Gemas, Negeri Sembilan and is almost parallel to the KTMB tracks. Highway joins Temerloh to Jerantut, and is the main gateway to northern Pahang.\n\nE-Hailing service at Temerloh - MyCar Temerloh. Mycar allows the passengers to find drivers in minutes and quickly gets you where you want to go. It’s fantastic way to get a ride on demand or in advance with just a tap on your phone, track your drivers and keep them in touch then pay seamlessly with cash and card.

The train service is provided by the KTMB.\n\nBy water \nThe water transportation among the locals still exists especially for those who live on the banks of the Pahang River. Water transportation is a necessity especially for the farmers to transport their crops as there is no bridge to connect both sides of the river.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for creating the superhero Marvelman, later known as Miracleman.\n\nBorn in Bow, London, Mick Anglo was educated at the Central Foundation School and John Cass Art School, both in London. On leaving school he freelanced in fashion and commercial art until 1939, and first drew cartoons for \"SEAC\", the official army newspaper for South East Asia Command in 1942, then for newspapers in Singapore in 1945. After completing his National Service, he became an author for a small publishing company, Martin & Reid, producing westerns, romance books and crime thrillers with titles such as \"Guns & Gamblers\", \"My Gun Speaks For Me\"/\"Muscles For Hire\" (1951), and \"Broadway Glamour\", under the pen-name Johnny Dekker. He also drew a small number of short humorous comic strips for the publisher John Matthew during 1946, and for two other companies, Rayburn and A. Solway in 1948. After illustrating the book jacket for one of his own novels, Martin and Reid suggested he developed strips for their comics line, and he worked on their comics imprint between 1948 and 1950; editing the line and writing and drawing western, adventure and science fiction strips and titles. He also produced a number of one-off stories contemporaneously with his Martin and Reid work for Paget Publications, one of the smaller British comics imprints of the day; producing short run, often single issue, titles containing a number of stories. Although contributing mainly short humor strips, Anglo's creations for Paget Publications included an early British superhero, Wonderman, who appeared for 24 issues in his own title from 1948 to 1951.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1952 Anglo produced a number of strips for publisher Arnold Miller's Arnold Book Company, on stories such as \"Captain Valiant\" (in \"Space Comics\") and \"Ace Malloy of the Special Squadron\", while concurrently producing \"Space Commando Comics\", featuring \"Space Commander Kerry,\" for L. Miller and Son, a major British comics company run by Arnold Miller's father, Leonard Miller and still writing novels for Martin and Reid. Early in 1954 Anglo opened his own comics production company, Gower Studios, in Gower Street, London. As \"an old school editorial packager\", Anglo's studio created \"packets\" for various publishers, usually comprising the entire content of a publication; and Mick Anglo Limited was incorporated on 21 August 1954 for the purpose of \"Artistic and literary creation\". Anglo and his staff of British artists, including Don Lawrence (who was given his first break in drawing comics by Anglo), Bob Monkhouse, Denis Gifford, Ron Embleton and George Stokes, had a hand in the creation of many British independent comic books and magazines between 1954 and 1963. \"I employed a pretty large staff of freelancers: scriptwriters and artists. Most of the artists had just come out of the Forces, and were looking for something to do\".\n\nIn 1954 Anglo created the character he is best known for, Marvelman. Since the mid-1940s L. Miller and Son had successfully reprinted American comic book company Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr stories in the UK However, in 1953 Fawcett were party to a protracted lawsuit brought by National Comics (now DC Comics) claiming plagiarism of their Superman character. Fawcett cancelled their Captain Marvel titles, leaving Leonard Miller without reprint material for their best-selling British titles. Miller approached Mick Anglo to create an replacement; \"One day Leonard Miller phoned and said he wanted to see me urgently. His supply of the American material for the Captain Marvel series had suddenly been cut off. Had I any ideas? ... So I quickly told him I had plenty of ideas, and for my trouble I received a regular supply of work for the next six years.\" Anglo replaced the Captain Marvel family with almost identical characters, Marvelman, Young Marvelman, and Kid Marvelman. In the six years between the relaunch of \"Captain Marvel Adventures\" as \"Marvelman\" from issue No. 25 (3 February 1954) and Anglo leaving L. Miller in 1960, he was responsible for scripting 736 issues of \"Marvelman\", \"Marvelman Family\" and \"Young Marvelman\" the \"best-loved and best-known British superhero\" and the longest-running British superhero. Gaining further mileage from the Marvelman material, in 1954 Anglo wrote one issue of \"Captain Universe\" for Arnold Books, a near-identical character to Captain Marvel and Marvelman.\n\nAs well as the Marvelman family of titles, in the mid-1950s Anglo took over a number of L. Miller's established American reprint titles, continuing the series \"Jim Bowie\", \"Annie Oakley\", and \"Davy Crockett\" utilising both the English artists from his studios and a number of Spanish artists. In 1960 Anglo left Miller and the \"Marvelman\" and \"Young Marvelman\" titles went into reprint soon after for the last three years of their runs. He set up his own Anglo Comics imprint title from Gower Studios, launching \"Captain Miracle\", a title which used Marvelman reprints with changes to the artwork; \"Battle\", \"Gunhawks Western\" and \"TV Features\", the last of which contained reprints of material produced by the Studio for L. Miller. None of the titles lasted more than 10 monthly issues between October 1960 and June 1961; after which Anglo Comics folded. Anglo next adapted three stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde and Wilkie Collins for the British Classics Illustrated imprint of publishers Thorpe and Porter, a company for which he also devised a number of 68-page hardback annuals based on television series \"The Avengers\", \"Charles Rand\", and \"Danger Man\".\n\nDuring 1965–1966, Anglo produced thirteen issues of \"Miracle Man\" for Top Sellers publishers – a further revamp of the Captain Miracle stories from 1960, which had in turn been altered Marvelman stories. Also in 1966, Anglo was approached by John Spencer & Co, a company that had produced crime and western books since the 1940s, latterly under the sobriquet Badger Books, to launch a series of comics. Four titles appeared in 1966, \"Fantasy Stories\", \"Macabre Stories\", \"Spectre Stories\" and \"Strange Stories\", featuring, among other stories, a number of reworked strips by Gower Studios artists Ron Embleton and Bill Merrill, \"Spaceman\" (originally produced for Gould/Norman Light Publishing). With low production values, the John Spencer titles were not a success, and all folded within the year after six issues.\n\nDuring 1967 Anglo edited City Magazines Ltd's TV series-based weekly comic \"TV Tornado\", and contributed the short-run strips \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" and \"Green Hornet\", before returning to Top Sellers and packaging reprints of DC Comics material, including Superman, Wonder Woman and the Batman newspaper strip, for their \"Super DC\" anthology series in 1969/1970. Anglo then worked on the weekly \"Look & Cook\" magazine in the late 1960s, co-wrote a small number of cookery books, and was a joke writer for comedian Tommy Cooper. He has also written a series of nostalgic books looking back at the decades from the 1930s–1950s, with a companion duo of quiz books, a book about Victorian magazines, \"Penny Dreadfuls and other Victorian Horrors\", and one on cannibalism, \"Man Eats Man: The Story of Cannibalism\", together with a small number of stories or features for Fleetway/IPC's war comics output between 1979 and 1983, before retiring during the 1980s.\n\nAnglo had little to do with the revival of the Marvelman character in 1982 by Alan Moore for Quality Communications. Dez Skinn, the editor of \"Warrior\", in which the revived series appeared, said \"He wasn't crazy about our revamp, but he really didn't care either way.\" Eventually the Marvelman revival was terminated after legal threats from Marvel Comics over Quality Communications \"Marvelman Special\" (June 1984), which was composed of Marvelman reprints from the L. Miller days, and Eclipse Comics publishing of the stories, renamed \"Miracleman\", for the American market. The character became \"mired in a legal quagmire\" for 25 years, preventing further reprint or new character development opportunities. The situation was not helped by ownership doubts, not clarified by Anglo's contractual relationship to L. Miller and Son and their status as a company.\n\nEventually, in 2009, Marvel Comics purchased the rights to Marvelman from Mick Anglo, together with the rights for the 1980s \"Miracleman\" revival. having established that Anglo owned the rights to the character. Alan Moore is on record as saying that \"I'm very happy for this book to get published – because that means money will finally go to Marvelman's creator, Mick Anglo, and to his wife ... The main thing is that I will feel happy to know that Mick Anglo is finally getting the recompense he so richly deserves.\"\n\nMarvel Comics press release at the time quoted Marvel CEO and publisher Dan Buckley as saying \"It is an honor to work with Mick Anglo to bring his creation to a larger audience than ever before.\" The press release quotes Mick Anglo as saying, \"I did not think it would ever happen. It's a wonderful thing to see my creation finally back.\" Marvel have since announced that the first release of Marvelman material under their imprint is \"Marvelman Classic Primer\" No. 1 in June 2010, featuring an interview with Mick Anglo at 93, and a cover drawn by him; which will be followed by reprints of the L. Miller Marvelman stories in chronological order.\n\n\"The following is an incomplete list of those stories/comics known to have been written, drawn or edited by Mick Anglo:\"\n\n\n\n"}

They were also found in the mining, maritime, and nearly any other industry that needed a powered winch. Donkeys were often attached to a yarder.\n\nSteam donkeys acquired their name from their origin in sailing ships, where the \"donkey\" engine was typically a small secondary engine used to load and unload cargo and raise the larger sails with small crews, or to power pumps. They were classified by their cylinder type – simplex (single-acting cylinder) or duplex (a compound engine); by their connection to the winches (or \"drums\") – triple-drum, double-drum, etc.; and by their different uses: high-lead yarder, ground-lead yarder, loader, snubber, incline hoist, etc. A good deal of the cable-logging terminology derived from 19th-century merchant sailing, as much of the early technology originated from that industry.\n\nA logging engine comprised at least one powered winch around which was wound hemp rope or (later) steel cable. They were usually fitted with a boiler and usually equipped with skids, or sleds made from logs, to aid them during transit from one \"setting\" to the next. The larger steam donkeys often had a \"donkey house\" (a makeshift shelter for the crew) built either on the skids or as a separate structure. Usually, a water tank, and sometimes a fuel oil tank, was mounted on the back of the sled. In rare cases, steam donkeys were also mounted on wheels. Later steam donkeys were built with multiple horizontally mounted drums/spools, on which were wound heavy steel cable instead of the original rope.\nA donkey consists of a steam boiler and steam engine, connected to a winch mounted on a sled called a donkey sled. The donkeys were moved by simply dragging themselves with the winch line. They were used to move logs, by attaching lines to the logs and hauling them.\n\nThis describes the use of a steam donkey for logging operations. In the simplest setup, a \"line horse\" would carry the cable out to a log in the woods. The cable would be attached, and, on signal, the steam donkey's operator (engineer) would open the regulator, allowing the steam donkey to drag, or \"skid\", the log towards it. The log was taken either to a mill or to a \"landing\" where the log would be transferred for onward shipment by rail, road or river (either loaded onto boats or floated directly in the water). Later, a \"haulback\" drum was added, where a smaller cable could be routed around the \"setting\" and connected to the end of the heavier \"mainline\" to replace the line horse.\n\nIf a donkey was to be moved, one of its cables was attached to a tree, stump or other strong anchor, and the machine would drag itself overland to the next yarding location.\n\nIn Canada, and in particular Ontario, the donkey engine was often mounted on a barge that could float and thus winch itself over both land and water. Log booms would be winched across water with the engine and it would often be reconfigured with a saw to mill the timber.\n\nA donkey puncher is the operator of a small steam donkey, a machine used in logging in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe donkey puncher was the machine operator and engineer. Use of the term gained currency in 1920. In later times the donkey puncher was too far away from the end of the line for verbal communication, so whistle codes (steam whistles) were employed. The whistle operator was known as a whistle punk, who was placed between the men attaching the cables (choker setters), and the donkey puncher, so that he could see the choker setters. When the cables were attached, a series of whistle blows signaled the donkey to begin pulling and the choker setters to stay out of harm's way. This is an oversimplification of a closely orchestrated sequence of operations, where mistakes were often fatal and where good men stood in line for the jobs. Although the steam engine, and its whistle, have been replaced by gasoline and diesel engines, the whistle codes are still used in many current logging operations. The whistle has been replaced largely with airhorns.\n\nJohn Dolbeer, a founding partner of the Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company in Eureka, California, invented the logging engine in that city in August 1881. The patent (number: 256553) was issued April 18, 1882. On Dolbeer's first model, a 150-foot, -inch manila rope was wrapped several times around a gypsy head (vertically mounted spool) and attached at the other end to a log.\n\nThe invention of the internal-combustion engine led to the development of the diesel-powered tractor crawler, which eventually put an end to the steam donkey. Though some have been preserved in museums, very few are in operating order. A great number still sit abandoned in the forests.\n\nSteam donkeys were also found to be useful for powering other machines such as pile drivers, slide-back loaders (also known as \"slide-jammers\", cranes which were used to load logs onto railroad cars and which moved along the flat-bed rail cars that were to be loaded), and cherry pickers (a sled-mounted crane used for loading, onto railroad cars, logs that a grading crew had cut down). Sailing fishing vessels on the North sea operated vertical steam-driven capstans called ´the donkey´ to haul fishing lines and -nets, some of which are still operating today, even though converted to compressed air.\n\nAn auxiliary engine on a sailing craft (which \"does\" propel the vessel) is still sometimes informally known as \"the donk\".\n\nA functioning steam donkey is on display and occasionally operated at Fort Humboldt State Historic Park in Eureka, California. A non-functioning steam donkey accompanied by a plaque explaining the history of the machine is on permanent display at Grizzly River Run, an attraction at Disney California Adventure Park. Another collection of steam donkeys is located at the Point Defiance Park, Camp 6 Logging Museum located in Tacoma, Washington. The collection includes various steam donkeys, including one of the last very large ones built, and others at various stages of restoration.\n\nAnother steam donkey is on display along an interpretive trail at the Sierra Nevada Logging Museum in Calaveras County, California, an indoor open-air museum about the Sierra Nevada logging industry and history.\n\nAnother steam donkey is preserved at Legoland Billund on their Wild West gold-mine-themed railroad.\n\nOn August 1, 2009, a Steam Donkey was officially unveiled at McLean Mill National Historic Site in Port Alberni, British Columbia. It is now the only commercially operating steam donkey in North America. On that occasion, due to extreme fire risk, demonstrations of the donkey were not performed, but the logs hauled by previous test runs of the donkey (and had been loaded onto a truck) were dumped into the McLean Mill millpond, representing the first steam-powered commercial logging operation in North America in decades. This machine continued to operate after R. B. Mclean shuttered the steam-powered McLean Mill site in 1965. It ran until 1972 and was abandoned on site. It was restored by the Alberni Valley Industrial Heritage Society in 1986 for Expo 86 and, more recently, was re-certified for commercial use at McLean Mill. Agreements have been made with forestland owner Island Timberlands (owned by Brookfield Asset Management) to log, mill, and sell trees and lumber from the surroundings of McLean Mill.\n\nA wide-face steam donkey (called that because the width of the drum is greater in proportion to that in later machines) has been operational at the Tillamook County Pioneer Museum in Tillamook, Oregon, since the early 1980s. Manufactured by the Puget Sound Iron & Steel Works in the early 1900s, this donkey was abandoned in the woods when the Reiger family finished logging their land in about 1952. The steam donkey was rescued and restored from 1979 to 1981. It was donated to the Pioneer Museum by the Ned Rieger family and has been on display on the Museum grounds.\n\nA vertical steam capstan called \"donkey\" for hauling fishing lines and nets is preserved on the museum fishing vessel \"Balder\" in the historic harbour of Vlaardingen (near Rotterdam), the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2066425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066425", "title": "Don Newton", "text": "Don Newton\n\nDon Newton (November 12, 1934 — August 19, 1984) was an American comics artist. During his career, he worked for a number of comic book publishers including Charlton Comics, DC Comics, and Marvel Comics. He is best known for his work on The Phantom, Aquaman, and Batman. Newton also drew several Captain Marvel/Marvel Family stories and was a fan of the character having studied under Captain Marvel co-creator C. C. Beck.\n\nNewton was born in St. Charles, Virginia, but after being diagnosed with asthma at the age of four, the Newton family moved to Arizona. Newton began drawing at a young age, with comic books being a major influence on his early artwork. He was a big fan of Batman and Daredevil, and an even bigger Captain Marvel fan.\n\nBy the mid–1960s, Newton was teaching art in Phoenix and worked part-time as a student art reviewer for the mail order \"\"Master Artist's Painting Course.\"\"\n\nNewton eventually discovered comic book fandom, while searching for a source to purchase old comics. Newton became involved with the Science Fiction and Comics Association (SFCA) and became an artistic staple in the organization's publications. Between 1968 and 1973 he produced almost two dozen covers for the \"Rocket's Blast Comicollector\" (\"RBCC\"). Newton did not limit himself exclusively to the publications of the SFCA; he also worked for most of the major fanzines during these years. In all Newton’s work appeared in over one hundred fanzines.\n\nNewton did one major strip during this time, which ran for more than a year in the \"RBCC\" called \"The Savage Earth\". Over a period stretching from 1968 to 1970 the science fiction strip appeared in issues 60–70 of the \"RBCC\". Issue #65 of the \"RBCC\" sported a Newton \"Savage Earth\" painting as its cover.\n\nNewton tried for years to leverage his connections in fandom into work at DC Comics or Marvel Comics, but he was at a distinct disadvantage living in Arizona. Marvel in particular wanted their artists close at hand. Newton finally set his sights a little lower and sent some sample pages to Nicola Cuti at Charlton Comics where his first professional comic book work was published.\n\nNewton's first work for Charlton appeared in \"Ghost Manor\" #18 (May 1974) and would work on Charlton horror books for the next year and half. Besides drawing for the Charlton horror comics, Newton also began painting covers for their horror and romance books.\nIn October 1975 Newton's first issue of \"The Phantom\", #67, was published. Newton would pencil and ink all of his Phantom work and would supply a cover painting for every issue he drew. Newton’s short run on the book featured two classic Newton pieces at Charlton. Issue #70 of \"The Phantom\" stars Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Claude Rains and is a mixture of \"Casablanca\", \"The African Queen\", \"The Maltese Falcon\", and \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\"\n\nNewton’s final issue of \"The Phantom\" features the Phantom of 1776 meeting Benjamin Franklin. It has a Phantom cover, the Phantom of 1776, sword in one hand, flintlock pistol in the other in front of a smoky background of the Declaration of Independence and a tattered 13-star American flag.\n\nNewton had always seen Charlton as a stepping-stone to Marvel Comics. While still working for Charlton, Newton worked on an issue of \"Giant-Size Defenders\", did some small uncredited inking on a few issues of the \"Deadly Hands of Kung Fu\" magazine over Mike Vosburg's penciled artwork, a frontispiece for the \"Savage Sword of Conan\" and a single painting for Roy Thomas, which years later, became a cover for Thomas' magazine \"Alter Ego\". Newton inked an issue of \"Ghost Rider\" over Don Heck's pencils and produced a cover for Marvel's \"Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction Annual.\"\n\nNewton began his career at DC with \"DC Special\" #28 (July 1977). Newton contributed the pencils on an Aquaman strip inked by his old friend Dan Adkins. Newton would draw Aquaman off and on for the next three years. That same month saw the release of Newton's first series at DC, \"The New Gods\" #12. Dan Adkins inked most of his work on the New Gods. It was during his tenure on this strip that Newton left his job as a junior high school art teacher to go work full-time as an artist. In the middle of Newton's run on \"The New Gods\", he and David Michelinie co-created the Star Hunters for DC but Newton dropped the feature after drawing two stories.\n\nOne of Newton’s lifelong ambitions was to draw Captain Marvel and he fulfilled this desire in 1978 when he was signed as the new penciler for the \"Shazam!\" title. He would draw this strip in its own title, as well as in \"World's Finest Comics\" and \"Adventure Comics\" until October 1982.\n\nNewton began drawing the Batman character beginning with \"Batman\" #305 (November 1978), and would draw 79 stories featuring Batman or members of the Batman family during his tenure at DC. Newton and writer Dennis O'Neil co-created the Maxie Zeus character in \"Detective Comics\" #483 (April–May 1979). O'Neil and Newton produced the story \"The Vengeance Vow\" in \"Detective Comics\" #485 (Aug.–Sept. 1979) in which the original Batwoman is killed by the League of Assassins.\n\nIn 1979 Newton returned to Marvel. He wanted to draw Captain America, but that title was unavailable at the time and \"The Avengers\" was the closest Marvel could do to fulfilling that request. Newton took the assignment when he was promised Joe Rubinstein as his permanent inker on the book. Newton finished the pencils for only two issues before returning to DC. Those two issues of \"The Avengers\" became \"Avengers Annual\" #9, half of which was inked by Rubinstein, half by Jack Abel. In 1981 Don Newton again left DC for Marvel. As was the case the first time, better money was one of the factors that pushed him to Marvel. Marvel had other artists, such as Val Mayerik, call Don to entice him into working at Marvel again. Unlike the previous time, Joe Rubinstein was not part of the deal. \"The Avengers\" #204 featured inks by Dan Green.\n\nDuring the time that Newton was drawing this second attempt at \"The Avengers\" book, he was contacted by Paul Levitz who promised him some additional advertising artwork, should Newton return to DC. After the \"Avengers\" inking by Green (which he had been unsatisfied with) and again the lack of scheduled work from Marvel, Newton agreed to accept a new contract with DC.\n\nNewton did two issues of \"Green Lantern\" in 1982. Both were Green Lantern Corps stories, one of which contained the first appearance of Ch'p, the squirrel-like Green Lantern of H'lven. Two years later Newton returned to \"Green Lantern\" in the only DC comics work he inked. In Newton’s obituary, Dick Giordano said of this work, \"To my mind, Don's final statement was the Green Lantern Corps story he penciled and inked that appeared in \"Green Lantern\" #181. He showed us how to do it right.\"\n\nHe drew the first appearance of Jason Todd in \"Batman\" #357 (March 1983), a character who became the second Robin.\n\nNewton had always told DC that the only series he would like to draw other than \"Batman\" and \"Captain Marvel\" was \"All-Star Squadron\". Editor/writer Roy Thomas tapped into that interest by proposing that Newton draw \"Infinity, Inc.\", featuring the children of the original All-Star characters. The first issue scheduled to contain Newton's art was \"Infinity Inc.\" #11 featuring a five-page framing sequence by Newton which surrounded a story drawn by George Tuska and Mike Machlan. Newton was to begin penciling the entire book with issue #12, but the letters page in issue #11 told of Newton's death. Newton suffered a massive heart attack in his home, after dealing with months of a debilitating throat ailment. He died three days later on August 19, 1984, in a nearby Mesa hospital.\n\nWhile Newton was in the hospital in a coma, the first three pages of \"Infinity Inc.\" #12 were sent to Thomas. Rubinstein was brought in to ink them and Newton’s Phoenix friend John Clark lettered the pages at Thomas' request. As a final tribute to Newton, Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter let Rubinstein out of his contract for a month so that he could ink a fill-in issue Newton had done. It became \"Infinity Inc.\" #13 (April 1985). This was Newton's last published original work.\n\nIn 2011, DC published \"Tales of the Batman: Don Newton\", a hardcover collection of Newton's Batman stories.\n\nNewton died on August 19, 1984, after suffering a massive heart attack.\n\nNewton won the Comic Fan Art Award in 1973 in the category \"Favorite Fan Artist\".\n\nComics work (interior pencil art) includes:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2066442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066442", "title": "The Cyrkle", "text": "The Cyrkle\n\nThe Cyrkle was an American rock and roll band active in the early and mid-1960s. The group charted two Top 40 hits, \"Red Rubber Ball\" and \"Turn-Down Day\".\n\nThe band was formed by guitarists and lead singers Don Dannemann and Tom Dawes (who also played bass guitar), and Jim Maiella (the original drummer), who all met while studying at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Dannemann enlisted in the US Coast Guard in 1966. The other members were Earle Pickens on keyboards and Marty Fried on drums. They were originally a \"frat rock\" band called The Rhondells but were later discovered and managed by Brian Epstein, who was best known as manager of The Beatles. Epstein found out about the band when his business partner, New York attorney Nathan Weiss, heard them in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Labor Day of 1965. Epstein became their manager and renamed them, as a reference to the circular roundabout known as Centre Square, located in downtown Easton. John Lennon provided the unique spelling of their new name. They were produced by John Simon.\n\nIn the summer of 1966, they opened on 14 dates for the Beatles during their US tour. On August 28, they headed the opening acts performing prior to The Beatles at Dodger Stadium. The other artists who appeared were Bobby Hebb, The Ronettes, and The Remains. Before touring with The Beatles, the Cyrkle had a successful engagement at the Downtown Discothèque in New York City. They were also on the bill for the final Beatles concert at Candlestick Park on August 29, 1966.\n\nThe Cyrkle is best known for their 1966 song \"Red Rubber Ball,\" which went to No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. It was co-written by Paul Simon, of Simon and Garfunkel, and Bruce Woodley of The Seekers, and was released by Columbia Records. Later in 1966, the band had one more Top 20 hit, \"\"Turn-Down Day\"\" (#16). After the release of their debut album, \"Red Rubber Ball\", they recorded a second album, \"Neon\", in late 1966, and a movie soundtrack, \"The Minx\", in 1967. They followed that with various singles and then disbanded in late 1967.\n\nBoth Dawes and Danneman became professional jingle writers after the Cyrkle disbanded. Dawes wrote the famous \"\"plop plop fizz fizz\"\" jingle for 'Alka-Seltzer'. Danneman wrote jingles for Continental Airlines and Swanson Foods. He penned the original 7Up 'Uncola' song. Dawes produced two albums for the band Foghat, 'Rock & Roll' (1973) and 'Energized' (1974), and co-wrote the song \"'Wild Cherry'\" on the latter. Marty Fried left the music business to attend law school and graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit in 1972. He now works as a bankruptcy attorney in suburban Detroit. Earle Pickens is a surgeon in Gainesville, Florida.\n\nIn the spring of 2014, the keyboardist of The Cyrkle, Mike Losekamp, joined a Columbus, Ohio based band called The Gas Pump Jockeys, a regionally popular classic rock act performing in the Ohio region and neighboring states.\n\nJoining band members Pat McLoughlin (guitarist/vocalist), Scott Langley (drummer), Don White (lead guitarist) and initially bassists Rick Brown (d. 2015) and later Mike “Roscoe” Rousculp (d. 2019), the band immediately incorporated the Cyrkle’s two biggest hit songs, “\"Red Rubber Ball\"” and “\"Turn Down Day\"” into their show featuring Losekamp on lead vocals. The songs became a highlight of each show the Gas Pump Jockeys performed.\n\nBuoyed by the crowd’s responses and a growing audience, McLoughlin elected to pursue the possibility of merging with surviving members of the original Cyrkle for a possible 50th anniversary reunion tour. This mission proved to be more daunting than anticipated. Losekamp had had no communications with any of his band mates since The Cyrkle disbanded in 1968 (following the death of Brian Epstein the prior year). The original lineup had retired from being rock musicians and established professional careers living and working in various parts of the United States. They had only performed together twice as a band (sans Losekamp), once in 1981 (in support of the “Hands Across America” event), and a second time in 1988, when they performed at their college reunion in Easton Pennsylvania. Although they remained on very friendly terms with each other, they rarely communicated over the next 50 years.\n\nLocating the original members to discuss a reunion was challenging for McLoughlin as he searched every state east of The Mississippi River for surviving members. He eventually located original drummer Marty Fried, now a very successful lawyer, living in the lower peninsula of Michigan. He also found keyboardist Earl Pickens, who had established himself as a highly successful surgeon in north Florida. In both instances, their very valuable careers were not conducive for being in the revised Cyrkle. Sadly, The Cyrkle’s original bass player, Tom Dawes (who had had a very remarkable career as a jingle writer), had passed away in 2007. So, McLoughlin set his sights on locating the band’s original singer and lead guitarist Don Dannemann. \n\nDannemann had successfully established in New York City his own highly successful advertising jingle company (\"Mega-Music\"), in the early 1970s. In 2008, he retired his business, moved away from New York City and was enjoying life as a retiree. He would occasionally perform in a duet, but for all practical purposes his musical career lay dormant. After months of failed attempts, McLoughlin at last located him in the latter part of the summer of 2016. He brokered a call with Losekamp, resulting in the first conversation with the two band mates in 50 years to occur. Losekamp explained the mission of trying to reunite the Cyrkle, and Dannemann expressed his interest in the project.\n\nFollowing a pair of conference calls in which McLoughlin explained the business model to all members, Dannemann agreed to travel to Columbus, Ohio to reconnect with Losekamp and to meet the other members of his Central Ohio band. He and the band quickly bonded, both musically as well as on a personal level. He agreed to join the other members of the Gas Pump Jockeys to form a new version of The Cyrkle featuring himself and Losekamp.\n\nThe Cyrkle performed for the first time to a live audience for the filming of a promotional video, and to record a live album (\"Full Cyrkle\") in November of 2016. They preformed professionally for the first time in five decades three months later in February, 2017 in Columbus, Ohio. On October 13, 2017, The Cyrkle began touring nationally starting in Lakewood, New Jersey, typically appearing with other classic rock contemporaries from the 1960’s music era. As of 2020. they continue to perform across the USA.\n\nThe reformed lineup, beginning in 2016, featured original members Don Dannemann and Michael Losekamp, joined by Pat McLoughlin, Mike Rousculp (d. 2019), Don White, Scott Langley, and later by Mike Shoaf (2019).\n\n\n\nhttp://www.thecyrkle.com / https://www.facebook.com/thecyrkle/\n"}
{"id": "2066444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066444", "title": "Peltigera", "text": "Peltigera\n\nPeltigera is a genus of approximately 91 species of foliose lichens in the family Peltigeraceae. Commonly known as the dog lichen, lichens of \"Peltigera\" are often terricolous (growing on soil), but can also occur on moss, trees, rocks, and many other substrates in many parts of the world.\n\nMost \"Peltigera\" species have the cyanobacterium \"Nostoc\" as the dominant phytobiont but some have the chlorophyte \"Coccomyxa\" in which case they also have small gall-like growths containing \"Nostoc\". Because of their ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, such lichens are influential in soil composition and generation.\n\nSpecies of \"Peltigera\" are foliose, with broad lobed thalli. Although the size of the thalli is variable and species-dependent, in some species the thalli can grow quite large, up to 30 cm in diameter. The color of the upper surface may range from drab gray, brown or greenish. Lower surfaces are typically \"without\" a cortex (unlike other foliose lichens), and cottony, often with fungal hyphae fused to form a network of veins. The reproductive structures isidia, soredia or lobules may be present in some species.\n\nAll species of \"Peltigera\" associate with the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria \"Nostoc\".\n\n\"P. didactyla\" is a common pioneer species on disturbed soils and nutrient poor grasslands in Western Europe. At Deception Island in the South Shetlands archipelago, \"P. didactyla\" was found growing extensively on ash from volcanic eruptions that occurred in the late 1960s and 1970.\n\nIn 1753, Linnaeus first described the species \"Lichen apthosus\" and \"L. caninus\" back when all known lichens were grouped into the genus \"Lichen\". Later, in 1787, Willdenow circumscribed the genus \"Peltigera\", and redescribed \"P. aphthosa\" and \"P. canina\".\n\nThe generic name is derived from the Latin language \"pelta\" (small shield), and refers to the shield-shaped thallus in these species. The common name, the dog lichen, refers to the perceived resemblance of \"P. caninus\" to a dog.\n\nIn a comparative analysis of both morphological and chemical characteristics as well as sequences of large subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA, it was shown that the genus \"Peltigera\" is monophyletic.\n\nThe \"Peltigera\" have a widespread distribution, and are found on all continents. There are 34 North American species, 30 European species, 25 species from South America, and 16 species from New Zealand.\n\n\n\"Peltigera\" species has been used historically to treat wounds, urinary disorders, thrush, tuberculosis, and rabies. \"P. apthosa\" was used as a remedy for cough and infantile aphthae.\n\"P. furfuracea\" has shown potent antioxidant activity and reducing power. Similarly, \"Peltigera\" specimens from Hawaii and Iceland have also been reported to show pronounced antioxidant activity.\n\nAlthough a few reports have described caribou and reindeer feeding on the thalli of \"Peltigera\", in general, species of \"Peltigera\" are not commonly used as a food source by mammals. A study of the grazing habits of the land snails \"Cantareus aspersa\" and \"Limax\" species revealed that these snails prefer to eat \"Peltigera\" species (such as \"P. praetextata\") that are lacking in secondary metabolites.\n\n\"Peltigera leucophlebia\" contains the compounds tenuiorin and methyl orsellinate, which are inhibitory to the enzyme 15-lipoxygenase.

It is the provincial capital of Sultan Kudarat. According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe Christian settlers would have preferred to decide the name of their new town by referendum. However, Captain Gunting., both revered and feared had decided it by himself.\n\nDatu Kudanding had reacted to the history of local battles way back in the early.Until 19th century when a sultanate in the adjacent town of Maganoy under Sultan Utto with a vast army decided to attack a small municipality located in the area now encompassed by the new entity under the leadership of Sultan Kudarat Mopak. Outnumbered with the ratio of 20:1, Sultan Kudarat Mopak on a white horse decided to do battle with his men notwithstanding the odds.\n\nThe battle cry of Sultan Kudarat was the uttering of the word, “Isu-silan” which means “They are there, advance”. This intrepid, although suicidal show of force and determination, so impressed by Utto, that in order to save lives on both sides, he decided to resolve the issue by negotiation, thus placing Kudarat and his principality under his protectorate of Utto, Isulan municipality derived its name from “Isu-silan “ which means “Progress”.\n\nThe present territories of Isulan formerly belonged to the municipalities of Koronadal and Dulawan. The municipality of Koronadal was created under E.O. No. 82 dated August 8, 1947 by Pres. Manuel L.

It had brought-in hundreds of farm tractors which uprooted big trees, cleared obstruction, planned, cleaned and harrowed the wide stretches of the area.

Isulanons believe that the wealth of arts and culture is expressed in many forms and in so many kinds. The festival showcases skills and talents in literary, musical and cultural aspects of the constituents both young and old.\n\nThe Hamungaya also depicts the thanksgiving festival of its residents who are mostly engaged in agriculture. This includes rice and corn farming, vegetables and crops production including the famous African palm which has contributed a lot to the utilization of its by-products as construction materials – the uniquely woven ”kalakat” known all over Mindanao.\n\nThe festival is divided into two parts: the first part shows the different activities being done in the farm. After which a thanksgiving is performed for their good harvest. The second part shows the merrymaking in the form of dance using different properties and materials that make it very festive.\n\nAs a whole, the Hamungaya Festival actually expresses life itself or deep-seated emotion communicated by the emotions of the human body blending with the music. The flow of body movements, the sound of the music and the grace with which the dance is executed all build up the story or emotions being communicated.\n\nNo doubt, this is a unique form of art, and along with other activities or talent being displayed during festivities, it is a contribution to the dreams of establishing solidarity among the peoples in the province of Sultan Kudarat.\n\n\n\n.*0.\n\n\"East Isulan District Elementary School\"\n\"Central Isulan District Elementary Schools\"\n\"South Isulan District Elementary Schools\"\n\"West Isulan District Elementary Schools\"\n\"Public Secondary Schools\"\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt was incorporated on August 14, 1959 through Executive Order No. 350 by President Carlos P. Garcia.\n\nTheir annual feast named \"Kalilang sa Biwang\" is celebrated every 11 November.\n\nIn the early days of the coming of Shariff Kabunsuan in Mindanao, Palimbang was not yet a dot on any geographical map of the island. This place was a mere abode of the primitive people whom we call not the cultural minority or highlander.\n\nAccording to Tarsila, there was a tremendous change in the society due to the spread out of Islam in the coastal areas widely known as Biwang, which later paved a way toward Islamic Civilization of the inhabitants. Palimbang at that time was locally known as Pula a tree widely grown in the place. A group of fishermen from Palimbang, Indonesia was lifted by strong winds and accidentally docked at the mouth of Pula River. They were warmly welcomed by the native datus headed by Sondalo Tambuto. The hospitality shown to them reigned in their hearts and drawn the visitors to settle and intermarry with the native Muslims. A new community was developed and later named Palimbang, in honor of the fishermen's hometown, which now remained the name of the municipality.\n\nAttempts to create Palimbang into municipality was thrice first, by the energetic leadership of Dr. Julio Sarayba in the 1940s; second, on July 24, 1953 by the seventeen (17) influential leaders of PAT-A-INGED (four communities) (1) Kraan, (2) Kanipaan, (3) Pula and (4) Maganao, namely: Dr. Julio Sarayba, Chairman; Sixto Quijano, Vice Chairman; Mr. Remegio Managad, Mr. Pedro Mamon, Mr. Pedro Bonifacio, Mr. Cresencio Geneza, Mr. Felipe Tunngala, Datu Pasay Ayao, Datu Manti Pangansayan, Mr. Lomontod Latip, Datu Talicop Lidasan, Datu Sundalo Tambuto, Haji Salik Manan, Hadji Druz Ali, Mr. Cecilio Domingo, Mr. Gorgonio Bagang, Mr. Dominador Durendez and Datu Sumana Sulog, members. Others are Datu Padasan Macut, Datu Obpon Dipatuan, Datu Pelangking Bayang and Mr. Dominador Garcia. It was a blast to the petitioners as they were regarded mentally unable to run their own government and the income of the barrios in the coastal portion was insufficient to meet the requisite of creating a new municipality. Third, by the same petitioner who collectively agreed to support candidates that will ascertain a seat of government in Palimbang in case they get elected. Fortunately, the well-supported Datu Udtog Matalam faction won. Subsequently, headed by the Provincial Governor of Cotabato Datu Udtog Matalam, the Provincial Governor of Cotabato recommended by the Members of the Board, sponsored by Congressman Salipada K. Pendatun, and supported by Datu Guiwan Mastura and Kiamba Mayor Cornelio Falgui, Palimbang was proclaimed municipality on August 14, 1959 by virtue of Executive Order No. 350, pursuant to Section 68 Revised Administrative Code, issued by His Excellency President Carlos P. Garcia.\n\nFrom its creation up to the present, Palimbang was served by twelve (12) generations of municipal officials. Datu Guiwan Mastura the Deputy Governor at-large became the appointed mayor who served the municipality until the 1963 election. Datu Guiwan Mastura then became the appointed & first elected mayor of Palimbang.\n\nMayor Datu Guiwan Mastura lost to Mayor Datu Druz Ali, Al-Haj in the 1967 election who remained supreme until the 1986 EDSA Revolution. The Revolutionary Government under President Corazon C. Aquino appointed Mocsin Manondong, Officer-In-Charge (OIC) but he ran for Provincial Board Member. Dimalub Namil became OIC Mayor during the 1988 election.\n\nMayor Labualas B. Mamansual was elected in the 1988 election and was re-elected in the 1992 and 1995 elections respectively, completing the three (3) consecutive term limit. Mayor Karim “King” Daud was installed after the 1998 election. Mayor Labualas B. Mamansual was elected in the 2001 election and was re-elected in the 2004 and 2007 election, completing again the three (3) consecutive term limit. A fresh and renewed mandate, was given to Mayor Abubacar P. Maulana in the May 2010 election.\n\nIn spite of the exceptional development potentials of Palimbang, the municipality is somehow left in terms of physical development. The municipal government is exploring strategies and pouring its meager resources to meet and welcome new challenges. With the private sector at the helm of its economy, coupled with its supportive citizenry and strong political leadership committed to the full development of its human and natural resources, the municipality will certainly make its vision for development.\n\nThe municipality of Palimbang was transferred from Cotabato Province to Province of Sultan Kudarat on November 22, 1973 by presidential decree 341 of President Ferdinand E. Marcos.\n\nThe Malisbong Masjid massacre, also called the Palimbang massacre, was the mass murder of Moros on September 24, 1974, in the coastal village of Malisbong in Palimbang, Sultan Kudarat, Mindanao where units of Gov. Siongco and the Philippine Army killed more than 1,000. Accounts compiled by the Moro Women's Center in General Santos City state that 1,500 male Moros aged 11–70 were killed inside a mosque, 3,000 women and children aged 9–60 were detained - with the women being raped and that 300 houses were razed by the government forces. The massacre occurred two years after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in September 1972.\n\nThe massacre started after the first four days on the feast of Ramadan when members of the Philippine Constabulary arrived and captured barangay officials along with 1,000 other Muslims and never came back. For more than a month, the military would capture murder residents in the area by batch. Testimonies show that victims were made to strip of their clothes, dig their own graves and shot.\n\nPalimbang is politically subdivided into 40 barangays.\n\n"}

His thesis was an expansion of a 1907 scholarly study of tonality, in which he coined the term \"atonality\". He began composing seriously in 1908 and over the next four years he produced around 120 songs. In 1914 he joined the faculty of the Vienna Music Academy, later becoming the institution's director in 1922. When the school was reorganized as the Hochschule für Musik in 1924 he was appointed to the position of rector, holding that post for three years.

Although most of his songs used piano accompaniment, about two dozen of them used symphonic accompaniment. His style is characterized by Slavonic and Italian elements, often with an impressionistic kind of lyricism. His output in the 1920s and early 1930s was focused on orchestral works, followed by a period devoted primarily to chamber music for the remainder of his career.

According to the , it has a population of people. \n\nIt is made up of Samal Island and the smaller Talikud Island in the Davao Gulf, from the merger of former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian.\n\nSamal is a part of the Metropolitan Davao area and is two kilometers away from Davao City, the largest city and the primary economic center of Mindanao.\n\nThe name Samal was derived from the Sama-Bajau peoples, the natives who were the first inhabitants of the island. The first datu in the island was Datu Taganiyug, a native of what is now Peñaplata, today the governance center of the city. In the past, the people of the island name a place about what was the said place known for. For example, the name \"Peñaplata\" is said to be derived from the word \"piña\" or pineapple because of the abundance of pineapple in the area; this, however, is folk etymology, for \"peñaplata\" literally means \"rock of silver\" in Spanish. Tagpopongan is the first barangay in the island which name was from the word \"tagpo\" or meet. It was so called owing to the fact that this place was chosen by the datus as their meeting place. The word Samal was also known before because it was commonly used as surname by datus.\n\nThe island was initially home to the Sama-Bajau peoples. Later on, Spain managed to conquer the island in the late 1840s when Nueva Vergara (Davao City today) was established.\n\nThe Pacific War, which happened during World War II, struck the island. Japanese fighter planes bombed the island. Japanese forces occupied the island and forced the people to work for four years until they were expelled by the Allied forces. After the war, infrastructure was built, like schools, churches and stores in the area.\n\nThe time came in July 8, 1948, when the entire island itself becomes part of the newly created municipality of Samal; it was the official founding of the municipality. Five years later in 1953, the municipality of Babak was created from Samal, marking the political division of the island between the two municipalities. Now came the political division of the island between the three municipalities, when the municipality of Kaputian was created from the island in 1966. In this period, the living qualities between these three municipalities became low and extremely rural.\n\nIn 1969, a proposal to create the sub-province of Samal was created by Republic Act No. 5999 and covered the area of the present-day city. The act was enacted without President Ferdinand Marcos' approval. However, the sub-province was never inaugurated.\n\nThe city was created through Republic Act No. 8471 in January 30, 1998. This act paved the way for the dissolution and merger of the three former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian into one local government unit by turning then into districts, now officially named as IGaCoS, the Island Garden City of Samal. The first city mayor was Rogelio P. Antalan, who later served for three consecutive terms from 1998 to 2007.\n\nOn September 22, 2015, Kjartan Sekkingstad, aged 55, from Sotra, Norway, was abducted by Abu Sayyaf Islamist guerrillas from a high-end tourist resort on Samal Island, along with two Canadian men, John Ridsdel, aged 68, and Robert Hall, aged 67, and a Filipina woman, Marites Flor, Hall's girlfriend. In April and June 2016, the Canadians were beheaded after ransoms were not paid, and in June 2016 Flor was released. On September 17, 2016, Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island, 600 miles south of Manila after captor Abu Sayyaf received $638,000 in ransom for his release. He was handed over to another rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front. The MNLF was in peace talks with the government and had been working with authorities to secure Sekkingstad's release. It is not known who paid the ransom for Sekkingstad, but it was not Norwegian authorities.\n\nSamal is the only city in the country that encompasses two entire islands, hence its name as the Island Garden City. While pristine beaches dot the island's shores, hills dominate the middle portions of the island. Talikud Island is located southwest of the main island. \n\nIGaCoS enjoys an evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year and a typhoon free climate, which make it ideal for agricultural production. \n\nSamal is politically subdivided into 46 barangays. In 1955, the sitios of Mambago, San Isidro, Santo Niño, San Antonio, San Agustin, Dangcaan, Balet, Tambo, Camudmud, and Cogon were converted into barrios of the now-defunct municipality of Babak.\nCebuano is the medium of language of the people of Samal Island, followed by Isama, Boholano and Tausug.\n\nThe city's economy depends greatly in its agricultural production. Copra, mango, corn, vegetables, citrus and fish are the major products of the island. Livestock production is also a major product with Davao City as the primary market. In addition, rice is also produced in the barangays of Libuak in Babak District and Aumbay in Peñaplata District.\n\nThe city is the largest resort city in the country. It has good beaches and houses many beach resorts. It has also numerous marine reefs and tranquil waters that lure the tourists to visit them, especially in Talikud Island. There are 34 registered resorts with a combined capacity of 1,000 rooms in the city. The most popular of these is the Pearl Farm Beach Resort, owned by Ms. Universe 1973 winner Margarita Moran. Because of these, the Department of Tourism named it one of the best visiting islands in Mindanao and currently one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the country. Thus, tourism is the main source of income in the city. Biggest taxes are imposed to tourism and resort industry.\nThere are three main festivals held annually in the city, namely: \n\nMonfort Bat Sanctuary, the world's largest fruit bat colony, is also located in the island.\n\nFishing is also a growing business sector in this city, since the city was situated on the island, it cannot fully complement the demand for meat products imported from other parts of the country, especially in nearby Davao City. The city has no both container port and deep-water transport terminal, except for a barge wharf at Babak district, to deliver market products directly to the city, so the city government advocated building fishery complexes across the city to minimize the demand for market products imported to the city. Fish, pearls, and edible crustaceans such as shrimps, prawns, and crabs are the main aquatic consumable products in the city.\n\nThe center of city governance is located at Barangay Peñaplata, Samal District, situated at the west central coast of the island. The city has three districts: Babak, Samal and Kaputian. These districts used to serve as separate towns until the 1998 city merger.\n\nBarge/ferry service or passenger boats from the Sasa Wharf & Santa Ana Wharf in Davao City serves the island city. The modes of transportation on the island are motorcycles, tricycles or trikes, and bus and private car services offered by resorts.\n\nBus operators:\n\n\n\n"}

He was a pupil of Franz Liszt and one of the most distinguished pianists of his generation. Josef Hofmann called von Sauer \"a truly great virtuoso.\" Martin Krause, another Liszt pupil, called von Sauer \"the legitimate heir of Liszt; he has more of his charm and geniality than any other Liszt pupil.\"\n\nSauer was born in Hamburg, Germany on 8 October 1862 as Emil Georg Conrad Sauer. He studied with Nikolai Rubinstein at the Moscow Conservatory between 1879 and 1881. On an 1884 visit to Italy he met the Countess von Sayn-Wittgenstein, who recommended him to her former paramour, Franz Liszt. He went on to study with Liszt for two years, but did not for some time consider himself a Liszt pupil. In an 1895 interview, he even denied it: \"It is not correct to regard me as a pupil of Liszt, though I stayed with him for a few months. He was then very old, and could not teach me much. My chief teacher has been, undoubtedly, Nicholas Rubinstein.\" In his later years, however, Sauer realized the influence of Liszt on himself and on music in general.\n\nFrom 1882 Sauer made frequent and successful tours as a virtuoso pianist; his performing career lasted until 1940. He premiered in London in 1894 and New York in 1899. In 1901 he was appointed head of the Meisterschule für Klavierspiel at the Vienna Academy. Sauer left this post in April 1907 but returned to it in 1915. Some of his pupils continued on to successful concert or other significant music careers, \n\nIn 1917, Sauer was raised to the peerage by the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy, which added the nobiliary particle \"von\" to his name. He was also awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society of London.\n\nEmil von Sauer was married twice. Angelica Morales (Sauer), his second wife, carried on his legacy in teaching. Sauer had two sons with Morales — Julio and Franz.\n\nHe died in Vienna, Austria on 27 April 1942, aged 79.\n\nRegardless of his own opinion initially, Sauer was considered to have emphasized the original Liszt approach to piano as well as a strong Romantic approach to a musical technique which demanded total command of the keyboard in what was known as the Liszt School of piano. Unlike his fellow pupil Moriz Rosenthal, who could overwhelm the keyboard with orchestral force, von Sauer was said to caress the piano in a suave, polished manner. His recordings show him as a smooth pianist who was inclined toward relaxed tempos and the exactitude of detail over temperament. While his playing may have sometimes lacked breadth, it was always elegant and beautifully finished.\n\nAlong with editing the complete piano works of Johannes Brahms and a number of academic works by Pischna, Plaidy and Kullak, Sauer wrote piano concertos, piano sonatas, concert études, piano pieces and lieder. His compositions have been considered of minor importance. Nevertheless, six CDs of his piano music were recorded by Oleg Marshev.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066528", "title": "Tagum", "text": "Tagum\n\n', officially the ', (), or simply referred to as Tagum City, is a and capital of the , . According to the , it has a population of people making it the most populous component city in Mindanao.\n\nIt is one of the top most livable cities in the Philippines, and was one of the finalists in Most Child Friendly City in the Philippines – Component Category along with Laoag, and Talisay, Cebu. In the recently released 2017 Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI), the City of Tagum ranked third on the Overall Competitive Component Cities in the Philippines, second on Infrastructure, fourth in Resiliency, seventeenth on Economic Dynamism and twenty-fourth on Government Efficiency.\n\nTagum has a total land area of , which is predominantly agricultural, and produces various kinds of crops like coconut, rice, Cavendish banana, fruit trees like durian, lanzones and other agricultural crops for non-commercial use.\n\nThe city is strategically located at the northern portion of Southern Mindanao and lies in the intersection of three major road network systems namely: the Phil-Japan Friendship Highway, the Davao-Mati-Agusan road and the soon to be completed Davao-Bukidnon road that connects the city to other major destinations in the region and in the rest of Mindanao. With this, the city serves as a vital economic crossroad not only for the province, but for the entire Davao Region as well, linking Davao City to the northern city of Butuan (in Agusan del Norte), to Mati (in Davao Oriental) and the Surigao provinces.\n\nThe city is located 55 kilometers north of Davao City, the main economic and administrative center of Region XI. It takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes travel to Davao City. The city lies between 7°26′ N latitude and 125°48' E Longitude. It is bounded by the Municipalities of Asuncion, New Corella, and Mawab on the north, Maco on the east, and B.E. Dujali on the west. Carmen lies on its southwestern borders, while it faces the Davao Gulf directly to the south.\n\nTagum is politically subdivided into 23 barangays.\n\nTagum has a tropical rainforest climate (type \"Af\") under the Köppen climate classification system. The city enjoys a weather that remains balmy all year round. It is characterized by a uniform distribution of rainfall, temperature, humidity, and air pressure. It has no pronounced wet or dry season. Weather predictability makes it highly conducive to agricultural production. Temperature ranges from 20 to 32 degrees Celsius and average rainfall is up to 2,000 mm yearly.\n\nThere is no official record as to the origin and meaning of the name Tagum, but in Visayan \"tagum\" (or variants \"tayum\", \"tagung-tagung\") refers to the indigo plant (Indigofera tinctoria Linn.). On the one hand, a legend explains how the name Magugpo, the city's former name, came about. At the beginning, Magugpo was nothing but a vast wilderness, inhabited by the Mansakas, Manguangans, Mandayas and the Kalagans in the coastal barangays. The name Magugpo was derived from the native word \"mago\", a name of certain tree, and \"ugpo\" means very high. According to legend, the natives were occupying a river basin inside the thickly covered forest where they could not even see the sun. The creek where the natives dwelt still exists, but the once abundant fresh water is now dead due to pollution.\n\nThe first real transformation of Magugpo occurred when the first immigrant, an intrepid pioneer from Moalboal, Cebu, by the name Sulpicio Quirante, came in October 1929. More migrants came from the Visayas and Luzon. These included Cebuanos like Hermogenes Alburo Misa who owns \"Misa District\" and was Married to Balbina Narisma Misa. Their family owns almost all of the land in the heart of Tagum. Commercial, Industrial or Residential Property. They even donated a portion of their property to the Local Government of Tagum which are being used to urbanized the area. Misa Property has been utilized for the used of Public Schools, Markets, Terminals, Malls etc... Other Pioneers are Don Ricardo Briz and Felix Senanggote; Boholanons like Manuel Baura Suaybaguio, Sr. and Lucio Jumangit; Joaquin Pereyras from Pangasinan and Alfredo Pulmano from La Union and Encarnacion Sacramento & Felipe Sacramento from Ilocos.\n\nPhysical land developments started to emerge when these migrants organized themselves into the Magugpo Homesteaders' Association and bought the homestead of Lolo Mandaya, a native. They subdivided the land into residential lots of 750 square meters each and sold these lots at P1.50 each to newcomers. The amount paid by the buyer also served as membership fee to the association.\n\nIn 1932, Engineers Ignacio and Alib, both from Davao City, together with 15 laborers surveyed the trail for the national highway. During those times the only means of transportation from Davao City to Tagum was by boat using the Hijo and Tagum Rivers as its points of entry. This explains why the seat of government was first located at Barangay Hijo, now the Hijo Plantation in Barangay Madaum. Another seat of settlement during was near the river banks of Barangay Pagsabangan, the place where the remains of Datu Bago, the hero of Davao, is buried.\n\nThe first physical landmarks of Magugpo were a school building, a teacher's cottage, a rest house and a chapel, all of which were constructed by the Homesteaders' Association in the early 1930s.\n\nThe 1940s saw the establishment of the Municipality of Magugpo which was created by virtue of Executive Order No. 452, issued by then Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon on June 23, 1941. Before that, Magugpo was merely a district of Davao City. It was made into a regular municipality in 1941 by a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Cesar Sotto, Davao's representative to the National Assembly.\n\nIn 1941 Tagum had its first local civil government under the leadership of Manuel Baura Suaybaguio, Sr. and Sulpicio Quirante. Both were appointed as the first Mayor and Vice Mayor, respectively. Before the infant municipality could take-off, World War II broke out. The war badly damaged the Magugpo settlement. Only five houses were left standing at Magugpo after the liberation. From the rubble, Suaybaguio and Quirante spearheaded the construction of houses, drugstores, stores and a church (which remains on the same site even today). The national government's infrastructure projects such as the Davao Agusan national highway and provincial roads going to Kapalong and Saug paved the way to the influx of more immigrants to the municipality.\n\nThe local government of Magugpo was formalized with the holding of the first local election in 1947. Suaybaguio retained his position, gaining a new Vice Mayor in the person of Lucio Berdida.\n\nSignificant changes were made such as the renaming of Magugpo to Tagum by virtue of a municipal council resolution. In 1948, Mayor Suaybaguio transferred the seat of government from Hijo to Magugpo Poblacion. The following year the new municipality of Panabo was born. Vice Mayor Berdida who really hailed from the said place was appointed as Panabo's Mayor. This paved the way for Macario Bermudez to become Tagum's Vice Mayor.\n\nIn the 1950s, Tagum experienced many significant changes, not only in the political arena but also in its physical structures. Under the administrations of Mayor Eliseo Villanueva Wakan and Mayor Hermigildo Baluyo, in 1951 and 1955 respectively, the people of Tagum witnessed physical transformations in the town. There was massive construction of roads. The Municipal Hall was constructed and moved to its present site. The Municipal Health Center along Bonifacio St. was also put up. A public market site was donated by the Pereyras family.\n\nIn 1954, the boundary between Tagum, Mabini (formerly Doña Alicia) and Compostela was formalized by Republic Act No. 1102, approved June 15. The boundary line between the municipality of Tagum and Doña Alicia is the Dumlan River from the Gulf of Davao to the source of the river and a straight line from said source running northwestward to the concrete monument in the sitio of Libaybay. The Hijo River was considered the boundary between the municipalities of Tagum and Compostela.\n\nEconomically, Tagum was slowly becoming a convenient place for traders to exchange products with neighboring municipalities. The booming abaca and coconut industries in the early 1950s contributed significantly to the growth of the local economy. Alongside the economic development, came the establishment of two schools/colleges, Holy Cross College (now St. Mary's College) and Mindanao Colleges (now the University of Mindanao) which were then the only providers of tertiary education in the province outside Davao City. The presence of these two (2) schools slowly contributed to making Tagum another possible educational center for Davao.\n\nTagum's role as an important center for various activities was highlighted in 1967. It was a banner year for the municipality because it became the seat of the provincial government of Davao del Norte, when the whole of Davao was finally divided into three (3) provinces: Del Norte, Del Sur and Oriental. Tagum became a capital town, signaling its continued transformation. In the 1971 local elections Baloyo, after 16 years in office, was replaced by Gelacio \"Yayong\" Gementiza. Fortunately for Gementiza's administration, the economic losses of the dying abaca sector and the receding importance of the coconut industry were more than off-set by the gains of the emerging banana plantations. Indeed, the banana impetus propelled the total development of Tagum into a bustling metropolis. The once sleepy town became the beehive of business activities in Southeastern Mindanao.\n\nThe progressive economy then made it easier for Gementiza's administration to undertake infrastructure development projects such as the expansion of the municipal hall, concreting of the public market (through loans from the Development Bank of the Philippines), the asphalting of more municipal roads and opening of more barangay roads. In the process, various offices were created: Municipal Engineering Office, Municipal Planning and Development Office, Municipal Assessor's Office and the Fire Station.\n\nThe 1980s were turbulent years for Tagum, politically-speaking. There was a heavy turnover of local officials for various reasons. Tolentino's administration which started in 1980, was rocked by anomalies, thus forcing him to resign from office 16 months after taking his oath. Tolentino's resignation led to the appointment of Prospero Estabillo as Mayor and Victorio Suaybaguio, Jr. as Vice Mayor. As a result, there were major changes in the positions of the Council Members.\n\nLike the rest of the nation, Tagum suffered political instability and serious peace and order problems during the first five (5) years of the decade. The EDSA Revolution in 1986 practically changed the political climate. Baltazar Sator who was appointed OIC-Mayor then, was elected as Congressman in 1987. Victorio Suaybaguio, Jr., eventually assumed the leadership of the town after the 1988 election.\n\nIn spite of the prevailing political unrest of the early eighties, Tagum continuously enjoyed an expanding economy, though at a slower pace. There might have been a slight slump in the banana industry, but the discovery of abundant mineral resources, specifically gold, in various areas of Davao Province triggered the mini-local economies, not just in Tagum but in the neighboring municipalities as well. Thus, in the later part of the decade, the construction sector grew at an unprecedented pace. Towards the 1990s and onwards, Tagum has been undoubtedly turning itself into a strategic and important growth center in Southeastern Mindanao.\n\nThe 1990s have been significant years not only for Tagum, but for the entire Philippine Government bureaucracy. There was a radical change in the system of government through the passage of Republic Act 7160 otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. By virtue of the said Republic Act, decentralization had taken off. The former centralized form of government became decentralized through devolution. As an effect, local government units (LGUs) were given additional functions, powers, authorities and responsibilities.\n\nAlthough, the decentralization policy of state was very relevant and vital for local and national development, however, there were also problems and issues that were encountered along the process of its implementation. For Tagum, financial and organizational problems were felt by the local officialdom. This was because the former municipality has broader areas of services with only limited financial and manpower resources. But this situation had been gradually resolved through various revenue raising strategies and grants/aids from the national and foreign funding institutions.\n\nOne of the significant accomplishments of the officialdom of Tagum during the 1990s was its elevation from a second to first class municipality. This opened a gateway to increase its financial resources through the Internal Revenue Allocation (IRA) from the national government and local revenues.\n\nThis was under the leadership of Hon Victorio R. Suaybaguio, Jr. who sat as mayor Tagum for three (3) consecutive terms (1988–1998).As a matter of fact, during the 1995 election, all incumbent elected officials of Tagum, from Mayor down to the municipal councilors, were unopposed, making a significant event in the political history of Tagum.\n\nThe fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others. Confronted by this situation, the local government of Tagum engaged into the revision of its Municipal Comprehensive Development Plan (MCDP). This was spearheaded by the Municipal Planning and Development Office (MPDO) with the assistance from the University of the Philippines College of Architecture Foundation, Inc. (UP ARKI), Manila and the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLRB), Region XI.\n\nThe MCDP was approved in December 1993. And during that year, Tagum was the second municipality in Region XI which had an approved Municipal Comprehensive Development Plan.\n\nTagum had increased the number of its barangays when the division of Barangay Poblacion which is an urbanized barangay of Tagum occurred in 1995. This resulted to the creation of four new barangays, namely, Barangay Magugpo North, Barangay Magugpo South, Barangay Magugpo East and Barangay Magugpo West.\n\nAnother important event happened particularly in 1997 was the transfer of public market to the new P60 Million public market which is more than a kilometer away from the old market. The new market was constructed in a seven (7) hectare donated land by the Pereyras family. The said area is also the site of the new Tagum Overland Transport Integrated Terminal (TOTIT) worth P 60 Million and the Livestock Auction Center worth P 2.5 Million.\n\nForemost of the development of Tagum in the 1990s was its conversion into a Component City of Davao del Norte. Congressman Baltazar Sator sponsored House Bill No.7509 in the House of Congress. Prior to its approval, a public hearing was conducted in Tagum by the Committee on Local Government of the House of Congress, chaired by Congressman Ciriaco Alfelor. The said law passed all the requisites in the House of Congress, resulting to its approval.\n\nThen, Republic Act 8472 “An Act converting the Municipality of Tagum into a City, to be known as the City of Tagum” was passed to the House of Senate through the sponsorship of Senator Vicente Sotto III.\n\nOn January 30, 1998, the said Republic Act was signed into law by His Excellency Fidel V. Ramos and it was ratified through a plebiscite in Tagum on March 7, 1998.\n\nThe incumbent Municipal Mayor, Victorio R. Suaybaguio, Jr., who served his last term in the office, became the first City Mayor of Tagum. His incumbency as the first city mayor was only for a short period, however, because he resigned from the office to seek for higher political position. In the May 1998 election, Suaybaguio run as Vice Governor in Davao del Norte. By virtue of the law, Arrel R. Olaño, the incumbent City Vice Mayor took over the position as the City Mayor. However, he only served in his capacity as the mayor for short period because he also resigned and sought for higher political position as board member in the provincial government.\n\nThe next higher in rank in the officialdom was the first city councilor in the person of Octavio R. Valle. By this capacity, he took over the position as the Vice Mayor and became the Acting City Mayor of Tagum while running as Vice Mayor in the May 1998 election.\n\nThe first elected City Officials of Tagum assumed office on July 1, 1998 under the leadership of Mayor Rey T. Uy and Vice Mayor Gerardo R. Racho. In 2001, Uy failed in his reelection bid to Gelacio P. Gementiza, but regained the mayoralty seat in the 2004 elections as Gementiza became provincial governor of Davao del Norte.\n\nThe 2007 local elections saw the reelectionists-tandem Uy and Allan L. Rellon pitted against the opposition candidates Meliton D. Lemos and running-mate, Geterito T. Gementiza, with the Uy-Rellon tandem winning by a big margin of votes.\n\nAt present, the incumbent local chief executives, with the support of the City Legislative Council and various LGU organizations, initiated political will to forge a new brand of public administration. Mayor Rey T. Uy then replicated some of his management principles and strategies in the corporate world to his local office, with rapid urbanization, improvement of transportation, infrastructure and public facilities, rise of more businesses and improvement of lives amongst Tagumeños. In 2008, due to these improvements, Tagum became the second First-Class city in Davao Region (next to Davao City) with a combined income of PhP463,476,022.99 as recognized by the Department of Finance and Department of Interior and Local Government.\n\nThe 2010 general elections saw again the Uy-Rellon tandem against First District congressman Arrel Olaño and the tandem of Gementiza-Aventurado. Uy and Rellon won by a landslide and were proclaimed days after the said election.\n\nIn 2006, Tagum became the Palm Tree City of the Philippines. It also holds an unofficial record for having the tallest Christmas tree in the Philippines. At 153 feet tall, the stunning structure erected at the Freedom Park at the back of the City Hall rivaled Puerto Princesa City's 100 feet tall Christmas tree. Tagum is also the home of the world's biggest wooden rosary, made out of ironwood, located at the Christ The King Cathedral, also one of the region's biggest Catholic churches.\n\nSince 1999, Tagum annually hosts the Musikahan Festival aimed at showcasing the musical talents of Tagumeños, Mindanaoans and Filipinos in general, draws thousands of visitors both locally and internationally. Currently, the city is the only one in the Philippines to have a direct joint agreement with Venezuela for cultural exchange, in line with the 11th Musikahan sa Tagum in 2011, thus supporting the City's claim as The Cultural Center of Mindanao, and as affirmed by the University of the Philippines Diliman College of Music and College of Arts and Letters.\n\nTagum hosted three major national competitions in 2010, to wit, the National English Jazz Chants Festival, the National Schools Press Conference and the 9th Musikahan Festival. The 3rd International Rondalla Festival, the first international competition Tagum hosted in 2011, implanted the city into the roster of cultural hubs in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn recognition for the City's efforts in strengthening literacy in the region, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) will confer the Honourable Mention for the King Sejong International Literacy Prize to the City Literacy Coordinating Council of Tagum for its “Peace Management Literacy and Continuing Education through Night Market” programme.\n\nVice Mayor Allan L. Rellon succeeded Uy as the City Mayor during the 2013 Midterm elections, with Geterito \"Boyet\" T. Gemetiza succeeding Rellon's earlier post.\n\nTagum, from being a predominantly agricultural area, has become Mindanao's fastest-growing urban city due to its strategic location, being in the crossroads between the rural areas of Davao del Norte and Compostela Valley and the urban Metro Davao. Blessed with a developed infrastructure, the city manages to export goods like wood chips, veneer plywood, and wood lumber. Fresh bananas, however, remain as the chief export product.\n\nThanks to the influx of people from the countryside of Davao del Norte and Compostela Valley the rise of human resources has helped a lot in the revenue generation of the city.\n\nTourism has also become of the city's main economic powerhouse lately.

A woman named Cosima \"Codi\" Noline returns to her hometown of Grace, Arizona to help her aging father, who is slowly losing his struggle with Alzheimer's disease. She takes a biology teacher position at the local high school and lives with her old high school friend, Emelina. \"Animal Dreams\" features Kingsolver's trademark—alternating perspectives throughout the novel. Most chapters are told from the perspective of Codi, while others are told from her father, Homer's, perspective. The book was dedicated to Ben Linder, who was killed by the Contras on April 28, 1987.\n\nThe novel features some Hispanic and Native American themes. Codi's sister, Halimeda \"Hallie\", moves to Nicaragua to teach local people more sustainable farming techniques and dies after being captured by the Contras. Another political theme in the novel is the small town's fight against the Black Mountain Mining Company, which pollutes the river water and nearly destroys the citizens' orchard trees, Grace's primary economic livelihood.\n\nIn addition to political themes like these, many of Kingsolver's novels also feature images and themes from biology. \"Animal Dreams\" is rich with natural imagery and the study of the created world. And, as with most Kingsolver novels, this one is laced with genial humor.\n\nAnimal Dreams opens with a chapter narrated in the third person from the point of view of Doc Homer. This establishes a double narrative voice, which switches between dreams and memories of the past and events of the present. Doc Homer remembers his daughters, Codi and Hallie, when they were young. Their mother is dead. In the second chapter, narrated by Codi in first person, the plot line begins. Hallie leaves Tucson, Arizona, where she was living with Codi and Carlo, for Nicaragua. She plans to assist the newly established communist regime with their crop cultivation. Shortly thereafter, Codi also leaves Tucson, returning to her small rural hometown, Grace, to care for her ailing father and to teach high school biology. The return to Grace is fraught with difficulty for Codi, as she has always felt herself an outsider in the town and has never had a very close relationship with her father. Her return home raises the specter of several mysteries surrounding Codi and her family's past: her failure to hold a medical license despite her attendance at medical school, the deaths of her mother and of her child, and the relationship of her family to the rest of the community.\n\nIn Grace, Codi stays in her friend Emelina Domingos's guest house. As the two women talk, Codi's high school relationship with Loyd Peregrina is revealed. Loyd, a friend of Emelina's husband J.T., still lives and works in town. Re-visiting Grace, Codi is again struck by her feeling of being an outsider. Codi and Hallie's mother died shortly after Hallie's birth. At the age of fifteen, Codi became pregnant with and then miscarried Loyd's child. She never told anyone. Her father, the town doctor, was aware of the situation, but Codi still does not know this.\n\nCodi and Loyd meet again and begin a new relationship. Loyd, a Native American who grew up on the nearby Reservation, is ready to establish a serious and committed relationship, but Codi is not ready to imagine herself as staying in one place or loving only one person. Loyd accepts her ambivalence. They continue to see each other, and he teaches her about Native American Cultures.\n\n\n"}

Tyler also played the mummy in 1940's \"The Mummy's Hand\", a popular Universal Studios monster film.\n\nBorn Vincent Markowski or Markowsky (sources differ) in Port Henry, New York, to Lithuanian-American parents, Helen (née Montvilos) and Frank Markowski. he had two brothers: Frank Jr. and Joe (who changed his last name to Marko), and two sisters: Katherine (Mrs. Slepski), and Maliane \"Molly\" (Mrs. Redge). He made his First Communion in a small church in Mineville around 1910. His father and older brother worked in the mines for the Witherbee Sherman Company.\n\nIn 1913, his family moved to Hamtramck, Michigan, where he attended St. Florian Elementary School and Hamtramck High School. After graduating high school, he left home and made his way west, finding work as a seaman on a merchant steamer in the U.S. Merchant Marine, a coal miner in Pennsylvania, a lumberjack in the Northwest, and even a prizefighter.\n\nTyler was an amateur weightlifter sponsored by the Los Angeles Athletic Club during the late 1920s. He set a new world's amateur record for the right-hand clean and jerk by lifting . In 1928, he won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) heavyweight weightlifting championship, lifting —a record that stood for fourteen years.\n\nAround 1924, Tyler arrived in California and found work in the film industry as a prop man and extra. His first screen appearances as an extra included \"Three Weeks\" (1924), \"Leatherstocking\" (1924), and \"Wild Horse Mesa\" (1925). In 1925, Tyler was signed to a contract with Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Western adventures with a starting salary of about $75 per week. His first starring role was in \"Let's Go Gallagher\" (1925). In the next four years, he starred in 28 additional Westerns for FBO, including \"The Masquerade Bandit\" (1926), \"The Sonora Kid\" (1927), \"The Texas Tornado\" (1928), \"The Avenging Rider\" (1928), and \"Pride of the Pawnee\" (1929). While romance was generally underplayed in these early Westerns, a number of up-and-coming heroines—including Doris Hill, Jean Arthur, and Nora Lane—contributed to the overall appeal of Tyler's films, which enjoyed critical praise and were popular with Saturday matinee audiences. His four years with FBO gave him valuable riding and acting experience, and made him a popular cowboy hero in the latter years of the silent film era.\n\nIn 1929, Tyler signed with Syndicate Pictures, where he made his last eight silent films in 1929 and 1930, which included \"The Man from Nevada\" (1929), \"Pioneers of the West\" (1929), \"The Canyon of Missing Men\" (1930), and \"Call of the Desert\" (1930). In 1930, Tyler was loaned out to Mascot Pictures for his first \"all talking\" sound film, \"The Phantom of the West\", a typical ten-chapter Saturday matinee cowboy cliffhanger featuring a mysterious secret villain and numerous stunts and action sequences. Kermit Maynard, the brother of Ken Maynard, was Tyler's stunt double in the more dangerous sequences. In 1931, Tyler made his first Syndicate sound film, \"West of Cheyenne\", which showcased an excellent voice for Westerns, despite his awkward delivery of lines. Tyler concluded his tenure with Syndicate Pictures with \"Rider of the Plains\" (1931) and \"God's Country and the Man\" (1931). He was also strongly considered for the role of Tarzan by MGM in their \"Tarzan the Ape Man\" (1932)\n\nSyndicate merged into Monogram Pictures, which signed Tom Tyler to an eight-picture contract as part of the company's sagebrush series. These typical low-budget \"quickies\" included \"Man from Death Valley\" (1931), \"Single-Handed Sanders\" (1932), \"The Man from New Mexico\" (1932), and \"Honor of the Mounted\" (1932)—each made for about $8000. All of his Monogram films received critical and popular support. When Monogram chose Bob Steele to star in the next season's series, Tyler moved over to Universal to do three chapter plays—a safari yarn called \"Jungle Mystery\" (1932), \"Clancy of the Mounted\" (1933), and \"Phantom of the Air\" (1933)—while managing to fit in four low-budget Westerns for John R. Freuler's Monarch Pictures, including \"The Forty-Niners\" (1932), \"When a Man Rides Alone\" (1933), \"Deadwood Pass\" (1933), and \"War on the Range\" (1933).\n\nIn 1934, Tyler signed a two-year contract with Harry S. Webb's Reliable Pictures for eighteen low-budget Western films, tailored as second features on double bills for second- and third-tier movie houses. These films included \"Mystery Ranch\" (1934), \"The Silver Bullet\" (1935), \"Born to Battle\" (1935), \"Silent Valley\" (1935), \"Fast Bullets\" (1936), and \"Santa Fe Bound\" (1936). Despite a few well-done scenes and some good performances by supporting players like Slim Whitaker, Charles King, Earl Dwire, and even the silent-era \"Hebrew\" comedian Max Davidson, most of these films were of average quality with production shortcomings that restricted the effectiveness of Tyler's performances. By 1936, companies such as Republic Pictures and Paramount Pictures were producing larger budget better-quality Western films with impressive exterior locations that overshadowed the type of Poverty Row low-budget offerings that brought Tyler to fame.\n\nIn 1936, Tyler signed a two-year contract with Sam Katzman's new Victory Pictures for eight Western films, each budgeted at about $6000. The first five of these films were directed by Bob Hill and included \"Cheyenne Rides Again\" (1937) with Lucile Brown and \"Feud of the Trail\" (1937) in which Tyler played a dual role. Of lesser quality, the final three included two co-starring his wife, Jeanne Martel: \"Orphan of the Pecos\" (1937) and \"Lost Ranch\" (1937), the latter containing a rare scene in which Tyler lip syncs two songs: \"Tucson Mary\" and \"Home on the Range\". Following \"Brothers of the West\" (1937), Katzman did not renew Tyler's contract with Victory, replacing him with Tim McCoy as the company's top Western star.\n\nWith no starring roles being offered to him, Tyler took a job with the Wallace Brothers Circus in 1938. He returned to Hollywood and appeared in supporting roles and bit parts in several feature films, including John Ford's \"Stagecoach\" (1939) with John Wayne, \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" (1939) with Henry Fonda, \"Gone With the Wind\" (1940) with Clark Gable, \"The Westerner\" (1940) with Gary Cooper, and John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1940) also with Henry Fonda. His most unusual role was that of Kharis the mummy in Universal's \"The Mummy's Hand\" (1940), in which he was cast because the studio felt he resembled a younger Boris Karloff well enough to match stock footage of Karloff from \"The Mummy\" (1932).\n\nIn 1941, Tyler signed a two-year contract with Republic Pictures to star in 13 films in the popular \"The Three Mesquiteers\" series in the role of Stony Brooke opposite Bob Steele playing Tucson Smith, and Rufe Davis or Jimmie Dodd playing Lullaby Joslin. Tyler's $150-per-week salary during the first year was increased to $200 per week for the second year. These final 13 films in \"The Three Mesquiteers\" series (39 through 51) represent some of Tyler's best work, and his last leading roles: \"Outlaws of Cherokee Trail\" (1941), \"Gauchos of El Dorado\" (1941), \"West of Cimarron\" (1941), \"Code of the Outlaw\" (1942), \"Raiders of the Range\" (1942), \"Westward Ho\" (1942), \"The Phantom Plainsmen\" (1942), \"Shadows on the Sage\" (1942), \"Valley of Hunted Men\" (1942), \"Thundering Trails\" (1943), \"The Blocked Trail\" (1943), \"Santa Fe Scouts\" (1943), and \"Riders of the Rio Grande\" (1943), the last film in the series.\n\nDuring this period Republic, which failed to secure the rights to \"Superman\", purchased the rights to another comic book superhero, \"Captain Marvel\". In his late thirties at the time, Tyler was still in good shape and was offered the title role at $250 per week for four weeks' work. In the title role in \"The Adventures of Captain Marvel\" (1941), Tyler portrayed the first film adaptation of a comic book superhero.\n\nTyler's last major screen role was in the Columbia Pictures serial \"The Phantom\" (1943), based on Lee Falk's famous comic strip. In costume, Tyler bore a striking resemblance to the Phantom character, and he delivered one of his best performances. Columbia filmed a sequel to \"The Phantom\" more than a decade later, but the studio's rights to the Phantom property had lapsed. Producer Sam Katzman was forced to film new scenes with hero John Hart, wearing a new costume that resembled the Phantom only vaguely. The patchwork was released as \"The Adventures of Captain Africa\" (1955), and footage of Tyler's Phantom appears in some of the long shots.\n\nIn 1943, the forty-year-old Tyler was diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis. He was physically limited to occasional supporting roles in Western films, including \"San Antonio\" (1945) with Errol Flynn; \"They Were Expendable\" (1945), \"Red River\" (1948), and \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" (1949) with John Wayne; \"Badman's Territory\" (1946) with Randolph Scott; \"Masked Raiders\" (1949), \"Riders of the Range\" (1950), \"Rio Grande Patrol\" (1951), and \"Road Agent\" (1952) with Tim Holt; \"West of the Brazos\" (1950) and several other films with James Ellison; \"Trail of Robin Hood\" (1950) with Roy Rogers; and \"Best of the Badmen\" (1951) with Robert Ryan. Tyler was one of John Ford Stock Company appearing in six of the director's films.\n\nBeginning in 1950, Tyler transitioned to television work, finding minor roles on \"The Lone Ranger\" (1950), \"Dick Tracy\" (1950), \"The Cisco Kid\" (1950–1951), \"The Range Rider\" (1951–1952), and \"The Roy Rogers Show\" (1952). His final television appearances were in four episodes of \"The Gene Autry Show\" in 1952 and 1953. The last screen appearance by Tom Tyler was playing a \"District Marshal\" on the television series \"Steve Donovan, Western Marshal.\" The episode called \"Comanche Kid\" premiered on January 14, 1956, but had been filmed as a pilot in 1950. In it, Tyler had difficulty drawing his gun because of his arthritis.\n\nTyler married actress Jeanne Martel in September 1937; they met the previous year while filming \"Santa Fe Bound\" in which she was his leading lady. They appeared in two other films together in 1937, \"Lost Ranch\" and \"Orphan of the Pecos\". She most likely accompanied him on the road with the Wallace Brothers Circus in 1938.

After studying in Berlin, he moved to Switzerland in 1863. After ten years spent as a critic, pianist and conductor as well, he spent the last three years of his life composing. The conductor Felix Weingartner found it \"incomprehensible that his delightful opera comique, \"Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung\", should have entirely disappeared from the repertoire.\" Another great admirer of Goetz's compositions was George Bernard Shaw, who praised Goetz's \"Symphony in F\" above anything in the genre by Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms.\n\nGoetz, the son of a salesman, came into contact with music early in his life. However, he did not receive his first serious piano lesson until 1857 — although he already had begun to compose some years before. At the end of the 1850s, he began to study for a degree in mathematics, but broke this off after three terms to study at the Stern conservatory in Berlin, where he studied piano and composition with Hans von Bülow. In 1862 he successfully graduated from the conservatory.\n\nThe following year, Goetz was appointed as city organist of Winterthur in Switzerland (thanks to the assistance of Carl Reinecke), where he taught the piano and began to make his name as a composer. In 1868 he married, and two years later moved to the village of Hottingen, today a suburb of Zurich, but remained employed in Winterthur until 1872. Between 1870 and 1874, he wrote reviews for a music magazine.\n\nIn the last years of his life, Goetz had to withdraw from teaching and concert performance due to the increasing seriousness of his tuberculosis, from which he had suffered from the 1850s and from which he would eventually die, aged 35, at Hottingen.\n\nAlthough Goetz showed active interest in the important artistic trends of his own time (on the one hand Liszt and Wagner, on the other Brahms), his own compositional style was more influenced by Mozart and Mendelssohn, and to a lesser degree by Schumann. Goetz's music is defined by lyricism and great clarity, and in general terms can be defined as quiet and introverted. Goetz almost completely avoided spectacular effects. Great mastery of compositional technique is characteristic of Goetz's style, which is particularly apparent in the connectedness of motifs and the technical depth of movements.\n\nGoetz was no radical forger of new musical paths, but rather a composer in total control of his compositional technique. For a long time, he was almost forgotten, although Gustav Mahler performed a number of his works; only since the 1990s have his works been revived.\n\nGoetz's compositions include a symphony, two piano concertos, a violin concerto in one movement, much piano music, a piano trio, piano quartet, piano quintet, and sonata for piano four-hands (two players). There are also two operas, \"Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung\" (based on Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\") and, much less successful, the three-act opera \"Francesca da Rimini\", to a libretto by the composer and Joseph Victor Wildmann, based on Dante's \"Inferno\" (premiered at Mannheim, September 30, 1877).\n\n\n\n\n"}

He debuted in \"Prime\" #1 under Malibu Comics' Ultraverse imprint, and was one of its flagship characters along with Mantra and Hardcase . The character design was credited to Bret Blevins. The character also appeared in the superhero group Ultraforce.\n\nPrime is really a thirteen-year-old boy named Kevin Green with the power to transform into a super-powered adult. In this sense, he is very similar to the Golden Age Captain Marvel. And much like the Modern Age version of Captain Marvel, Kevin retains the thoughts, memories and consciousness of his thirteen-year-old self as Prime. This is a chief source of conflict for the character as he is frequently placed in adult situations and circumstances he may not be mature enough to deal with.\n\nPrime made his first appearance in \"Prime\" #1, dated June 1993, written by Gerard Jones and Len Strazewski and illustrated by Norm Breyfogle.\n\nAs part of the Ultraverse imprint, the comic was set within a shared universe of super-powered beings conceptualized by Mike Barr, Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber, James Hudnall, Gerard Jones, Larry Niven, James Robinson, and Len Strazewski. Image Comics, a line of creator-owned comics that had record-breaking sales figures, had a publishing deal with Malibu that had ended shortly before.\n\nWriters Jones and Strazewski used the book to explore a number of themes, such as the place of role models in establishing personal definitions of heroism, as well as touchy matters regarding sexuality and pedophilia.\n\nArtist Breyfogle set the definitive visual tone of \"Prime\". His style was marked by the use of interconnected panels with spilled margins and broken borders, as well as frequent use of speed lines and other hyperkinetic emphasis effects. Breyfogle's depiction of Prime was also distinctive for stark lighting, over-rendered musculature, and a dark approach to gore. Breyfogle departed as regular artist after issue 12. Among the artists who made up for Breyfogle's departure were George Pérez, Darick Robertson, and John Statema.\n\nMarvel Comics purchased Malibu in 1994. In 1995, Marvel characters began crossing over into the Ultraverse, beginning with the appearance of Thor and Loki in \"Godwheel\" — a crossover that revealed many of the elements that Larry Niven had written into the Ultraverse creators' bible.\n\nAs time passed, these incursions became more frequent, culminating in 1995, with the event known as \"Black September.\" This crossover effectively gave Marvel the license to rewrite many of the Ultraverse books' core concepts.\n\nKevin transforms into Prime by projecting an organic 'liquid flesh' material from his torso. The liquid flesh then shapes itself into a tall man with exceptionally large and defined muscular development. Prime can revert to his teenage form by destabilizing the outer body into a mess of protein goo, either consciously or when his Prime-body's energy reserves run out. When this happens, Kevin must pull himself out of the body's remains or risk suffocating from lack of oxygen.\n\nAs Prime, Kevin possesses tremendous strength with unknown limits and once lifted an entire outdoor gym with relative ease. His resistance to physical injury is also exceptionally high, having survived a close proximity explosion of several nuclear warheads. Prime can also fly at Mach-level of velocity. Although all of Prime's powers are modelled after traditional superhero powers, these limitations are defined mostly by Kevin's subconscious aspirations.\n\nIn fact, it is frequently suggested that the appearance of the Prime-body is formed mostly by Kevin's subconscious. Many of the features of the Prime-body are taken from Kevin's role models such as action stars and comic book superheroes. Another Ultraverse character who shares a similar origin, Elven, is a fan of Elfquest comics and creates a body for herself that is a mishmash of various Tolkienesque fantasy elements. The face of Prime also bears a striking resemblance to Kevin's own father, Russell Green.\n\nIn effect the Prime-body reflects Kevin's own attitudes towards heroism at any given moment. As such, Prime's physical appearance has changed numerous times. Common elements exist among the different Prime-bodies though, such as a stylized 'P' resting somewhere on his chest or cape and some metallic adornment such as chains or gauntlets. Some of his forms include:\n\n\nIn June 2005, when asked by Newsarama whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada replied that:\n\nPrime was a recurring character in the short-lived \"Ultraforce\" cartoon show, where Hardcase acts as his mentor (as he is the only one in the team who knows that Prime is a teenager), and he constantly bickers with Prototype, usually insulting Prototype because his lack of super powers. Prime's team faces off with other Ultraverse villains such as Rune and Lord Pumpkin. Prime is voiced by Michael Donovan, and Prime's alter ego, Kevin Green, is voiced by Amos Crawley.\n\nPrime was one of the action figures produced for Galoob's \"Ultraforce\" line.\n\nPrime also starred in a Sega CD disc published by Sony Imagesoft bundled with Psygnosis' \"Microcosm\" video game. Though marketed as a video game, \"Ultraverse Prime\" is actually a multimedia CD which includes digital copies of 12 issues of the \"Prime\" comic book, video interviews with Prime's creators, some concept art, and a beat 'em up game. The disc received a negative review from \"GamePro\".\n\nA pastiche of Prime was included among the army of Supermen in \"Final Crisis\" #7.\n\nOn October 8, 2002, Marvel Studios announced movie deals for Sub-Mariner and Prime with Universal Studios while Universal had the \"Hulk\" movie in post-production with a then-expected June 6 release date.

{"id": "2066576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066576", "title": "Joseph Holbrooke", "text": "Joseph Holbrooke\n\nJoseph Charles Holbrooke (5 July 18785 August 1958) was an English composer, conductor, and pianist.\n\nJoseph Holbrooke was born Joseph Charles Holbrook in Croydon, Surrey. His father, also named Joseph, was a music hall musician and teacher, and his mother Helen was a Scottish singer. He had two older sisters (Helen and Mary) and two younger brothers (Robert and James), both of whom died in infancy. The family travelled around the country, with both parents participating in musical entertainments. Holbrooke's mother died in 1880 from tuberculosis, leaving the family in the care of Joseph senior, who settled the family in London and took the position of pianist at Collins' Music Hall, Islington, and later at the Bedford Music Hall. Holbrooke was taught to play the piano and the violin by his father, who was not averse to the use of violence as a method of instruction, and played in music halls himself before entering the Royal Academy of Music as a student in 1893, where he studied under Frederick Corder for composition and Frederick Westlake for piano. Whilst at the academy he composed several works, chiefly piano miniatures, songs and some chamber music, which were performed at student concerts: at one recital, he substituted one of his own compositions in preference to Schumann's \"Toccata\", incurring the wrath of the Principal, Sir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie. Whilst at the Royal Academy, Holbrooke won several prizes including the Potter Exhibition for pianoforte (1895), the Sterndale Bennett Scholarship (awarded on 29 April 1896), the Heathcote Long Prize for pianoforte (1896) and, in his final year (with the \"Pantomime Suite\" for strings), the Charles Lucas Prize for composition (1897).\n\nAfter leaving the Royal Academy Holbrooke sought a variety of occupations. In 1898 he undertook a tour of Scotland accompanying the music hall singer Arthur Lloyd, but the venture failed and he was forced to return to live with his father in London. He then moved out of the family home to Harringay where he began to teach music privately, but once again without financial success. Around this time he decided to change his name from Holbrook to Holbrooke, probably in order to avoid confusion as his father was also still teaching privately. He subsequently adopted the variant Josef Holbrooke which he continued to use inconsistently throughout the remainder of his life. Responding to an advertisement in \"Musical News\", Holbrooke travelled to Horncastle in Lincolnshire where he briefly lived with and served as musical companion to the Reverend Edward Stewart Bengough (1839-1920). He was soon travelling again, conducting a touring pantomime (\"Aladdin and the Lamp\") during the 1899-1900 Christmas season. Once more, however, the enterprise collapsed and Holbrooke was left stranded and virtually destitute, at which point Bengough sent him money to enable him to return to London.\n\nWhilst on tour, Holbrooke had sent the score of his orchestral poem \"The Raven\" to August Manns, conductor at the Crystal Palace. Manns accepted the work for performance and gave the premiere on 3 March 1900, whilst later that same year the orchestral variations on \"Three Blind Mice\" were also heard (Queen's Hall Promenade Concert, conducted by Henry Wood, 8 November 1900). In 1901 he won the Lesley Alexander Prize for chamber music with his Sextet in F minor and also received an invitation from Granville Bantock to become a member of the staff at the Birmingham and Midland Institute School of Music. He accepted the position, living with the Bantocks whilst teaching at the institution, but rapidly became dissatisfied with the routine and returned to London in 1902. There then followed a decade of prestigious commissions and performances, with notable works including the poem for chorus and orchestra \"Queen Mab\" (Leeds Festival, conducted by the composer, 6 October 1904), the orchestral poem \"Ulalume\" (Queen's Hall, conducted by the composer, 26 November 1904), the scena for baritone and orchestra \"Marino Faliero\" (Bristol Festival, conducted by the composer, 12 October 1905), the \"Bohemian Songs\" for baritone and orchestra (Norwich Festival, conducted by the composer, 25 October 1905), the poem for chorus and orchestra \"The Bells\" (Birmingham Festival, conducted by Hans Richter, 3 October 1906), the orchestral suite \"Les Hommages\" (Queen's Hall Promenade Concert, conducted by Henry Wood, 25 October 1906) and the choral symphony \"Homage to E.A. Poe\" (two movements first performed at the Bristol Festival, 16 October 1908). During this period Holbrooke also won a further prize, this time with his Fantasie Quartet, Op.17b entered for the 1905 chamber music competition initiated by Walter Willson Cobbett.\n\nIn 1907 Holbrooke was approached by the poet Herbert Trench who wished the composer to set his extended poem on immortality \"Apollo and the Seaman\". This Holbrooke duly did, although only the final section of the poem (\"The Embarkation\") is actually sung (by a male chorus), the rest of the score being a purely orchestral illustration of the verses. The completed work, styled \"An Illuminated Symphony\", was first performed at Queen's Hall on 20 January 1908, conducted by Thomas Beecham: on this occasion the orchestra and chorus were hidden from the audience behind an elaborate screen whilst the text of the poem was projected onto the screen using lantern slides at corresponding points in the music. The rehearsals for \"Apollo and the Seaman\" were attended by Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden who shortly after the first performance approached Holbrooke with one of his own poems, entitled \"Dylan - Son of the Wave\": this resulted in the composition of the opera \"Dylan\", first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, conducted by Artur Nikisch, on 4 July 1914. The staging included another technological wonder:\n\nCollaboration on two further operas, \"The Children of Don\" (first performed at the London Opera House, conducted by Arthur Nikisch, on 15 June 1912 - postponed from 12 June) and \"Bronwen\", brought about the completion of Holbrooke's most ambitious project, a trilogy under the collective title \"The Cauldron of Annwn\" setting Scott-Ellis' versions of tales from the Welsh Mabinogion. Until his death in 1946, Scott-Ellis effectively acted as patron to Holbrooke, subsidising performances and publication of many of his works.\n\nThroughout this period, Holbrooke also enjoyed a successful career as a virtuoso concert pianist. Besides his own compositions, his repertoire included the Toccata by Robert Schumann, \"Islamey\" by Mily Balakirev, Scriabin's Piano Sonata No.1, the fantasie \"Africa\" for piano and orchestra by Saint-Saëns, Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1 and Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No.2.\n\nIn 1902 Holbrooke had begun his own series of chamber music concerts to promote his music alongside new works by his British contemporaries. Audiences would regularly find admonishing notes printed in their programmes:\n\nWhen war broke out in 1914 he turned his attention to vigorously denouncing both the lack of support given to British music and the continued favour afforded to that of other countries, especially Germany. He published a series of five essays entitled \"British Music Versus German Music\" which appeared weekly in \"The New Age\" between 5 November and 3 December 1914:\n\nThe personal tone which informed much of the writing was too strong for some commentators who saw it as blatant self-promotion:\n\nThe fact that Holbrooke had recently issued a number of works under a pseudonym was also seized upon and viewed with suspicion:\n\nUndoubtedly, Holbrooke was a difficult and prickly person to deal with professionally. Shortly before a concert in Bournemouth on 22 February 1917, where the composer was to give a performance of his piano concerto \"Gwyn ap Nudd\", the conductor Dan Godfrey was compelled to hastily insert apology slips into each of the programmes to the following effect:\n\nIn fact, what had annoyed Holbrooke was the greater prominence which the printed advertisements gave to Vladimir Pachmann who was due to play two days later: he felt that this was yet another instance where a foreigner was being given undue celebrity to the detriment of a native pianist. Such outbursts of pique were characteristic and he gained the reputation of a troublesome and cantankerous eccentric:\n\nFollowing the First World War, with his own music increasingly side-lined, Holbrooke continued ever more vehemently to berate his critics. A particular target was Ernest Newman, initially an enthusiast for Holbrooke's music but who latterly became cool towards the composer:\n\nHowever, at the same time, Holbrooke continued to vigorously and vociferously promote compositions by other contemporary British composers both through performance at his own chamber music concerts and in print:\n\nPerhaps Holbrooke found some satisfaction in seeing his war-time attitude towards greater British representation in concert-halls echoed retrospectively, albeit without the same controversy:\n\nPerformances of his own music continued sporadically, but included several of great importance: \"The Children of Don\" (\"Die Kinder der Don\") was given five times at the Vienna Volksoper under Felix Weingartner, and three times in Salzburg under Ludwig Kaiser (1876-1932), in 1923; \"Bronwen\" was first performed in Huddersfield by The Carl Rosa Opera Company on 1 February 1929 and then taken on tour; and the ballet \"Aucassin and Nicolette\" was performed over two hundred times by the Markova-Dolin Ballet Company during the 1935-36 season. Holbrooke had spent extended periods of time at Harlech, Wales, since around 1915, Scott-Ellis having provided him with a number of residences, and in the early 1920s he moved with his family to a house which he appropriately named \"Dylan\". In the early hours of 9 November 1928, whilst the rest of the family were in London, fire broke out and the house was completely gutted: Holbrooke sustained serious head injuries and his music library was destroyed. This disaster precipitated a return to London where, having bought back many of the copyrights on his earlier works, Holbrooke set up his own publishing house \"Modern Music Library\", operating from his various London homes: through this outlet he ensured that his compositions remained available and also issued several printed catalogues of his works.\n\nFrom about the age of forty he began to suffer problems with his hearing, eventually becoming profoundly deaf, an affliction which tended to increase his isolation and irascibility. The condition also served to curtail his career as a concert pianist: when Holbrooke revised his Piano Concerto \"The Song of Gwyn ap Nudd\" in 1923 it was for a performance given by Frederic Lamond.\n\nA \"Holbrooke Music Society\" was founded in 1931 to promote the composer's works, Scott-Ellis being the Patron and Granville Bantock acting as President. Until Bantock's death in 1946, Holbrooke maintained frequent correspondence with the older composer, railing against the BBC's apparent unwillingness to broadcast performances of his music. Despite his neglect by the musical establishment, Holbrooke continued to compose throughout the 1930s and 1940s, working on several large-scale projects including an opera-ballet \"Tamlane\", two further choral symphonies, \"Blake\" and \"Milton\", both of which were probably unfinished, and choral settings of Kipling's poetry, also unfinished. He also devoted much of his time to revising and recasting his earlier works. Whilst resident in London, Holbrooke lived at various addresses including 22 Harringay Grove, Hornsey (c.1902-1910), Vale House, Tufnell Park (c.1910-c.1924), 60 Boundary Road, St John's Wood (c.1929-1937), 48 Boundary Road, St John's Wood (1937-1940), and 55 Alexandra Road, St John's Wood (1940-1958). Between September 1940 and March 1941, at the height of the Blitz, he moved out of London to live with friends in Taunton, Somerset, before returning to the capital permanently in the summer. He died at 55 Alexandra Road, St John's Wood, London, on 5 August 1958 at the age of eighty and was survived by his wife Dorothy ('Dot') Elizabeth Hadfield whom he had married in 1904. The couple had five children: Mildred (born 1905), Anton (1908), Barbara (1909), Gwydion (1912) and Diana (1915), the last of whom was married to the renowned clarinettist Reginald Kell. The youngest son changed his name to Gwydion Brooke and became a pre-eminent English bassoonist, also actively promoting the music of his father through a continuation of the \"Modern Music Library\", renamed \"The Blenheim Press\".\n\nHolbrooke was fascinated by the writings of Edgar Allan Poe which deal with the supernatural and the macabre, eventually producing over thirty compositions which he referred to as his \"Poeana\". These included orchestral works (\"The Raven\", \"Ulalume\", \"The Sleeper\", \"Amontillado\" and \"The Pit and the Pendulum\"), a double concerto for clarinet and bassoon (\"Tamerlane\"), choral works (a choral symphony \"Homage to E.A. Poe\" and a poem for chorus and orchestra \"The Bells\"), a ballet (\"The Masque of the Red Death\"), a multitude of chamber works (such as the Clarinet Quintet \"Ligeia\", the Trio \"Fairyland\" and the Nonet \"Irene\") and several piano pieces.\n\nDuring the early 1920s he became interested in writing in the new jazz idiom:\n\nHe produced several foxtrots and valses for dance orchestra and, perhaps uniquely amongst prominent British composers, also composed and compiled suites of pieces for theatre orchestras to accompany silent films. He was also notably productive in writing original works for both brass band and military band.\n\nThroughout his career he continually revised his compositions: titles were changed with an almost casual regularity (for instance, the opera \"Pierrot and Pierrette\" became \"The Stranger\", the opera-ballet \"The Wizard\" became \"The Enchanter\" and the dramatic overture for brass band \"1914\" became \"Clive of India\"), many works were assigned several different opus numbers at different times, he borrowed music from one piece to another and recast works in different forms: for example, \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" draws its material from the opera-ballet \"The Enchanter\", Symphony No.7 (\"Al Aaraaf\") is a transcription for string orchestra of a String Sextet, \"The Masque of the Red Death\" which was originally another orchestral poem became a ballet, and what was illustrative of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Skeleton in Armour\" was seemingly also a close depiction of Byron's \"The Corsair\", whilst several different versions of his orchestral variations on \"Auld Lang Syne\" exist with a number of the supposed 'musical portraits' apparently applicable simultaneously to different contemporaries. Larger scores, particularly the operas in the \"Cauldron of Annwn\" trilogy, were also quarried to produce a variety of subsidiary works. Trios became quartets, quintets became sextets, chamber works and piano suites were augmented with additional movements only to be subsequently contracted by the removal of others, pieces for clarinet and piano were arranged for brass band and works which figure prominently in early promotional catalogues subsequently vanish from later ones:\n\nHolbrooke was a late-Romantic composer, writing in a predominantly tonal, though richly chromatic, idiom. His style was essentially eclectic: whilst the early chamber works echo the language and methods of Brahms and Dvořák, there is also an exuberance informed by his affection for the music of Tchaikovsky:\n\nThe orchestral scores display a virtuosity of instrumentation which owes much to Elgar and Richard Strauss, reaching a peak in works such as \"Queen Mab\", \"The Bells\", \"Apollo and the Seaman\" and \"The Children of Don\". From his early maturity onwards, Holbrooke evinced a sophisticated appreciation of orchestral tone-colour, using several unusual instruments in his scores including the concertina (\"The Bells\"), sarrusophone (\"Apollo and the Seaman\"), saxhorn and saxophone (Serenade for oboe d'amore, clarinet, basset horn, two saxhorns, viola, five saxophones and harp). His reputation for using outlandish instruments and inflated orchestral resources is, however, generally undeserved: most of his large-scale works are scored for the modern symphony orchestra as used in the early twentieth century. Hannen Swaffer, a writer for \"The Graphic\", referred humorously to Holbrooke on several occasions as \"The Cockney Wagner\", although the only real similarity between the two was a predeliction for mythological music drama:\n\nHolbrooke generally utilised the freely-developing musical form as pioneered by Liszt, only loosely acknowledging more academic structures such as sonata form. This preference is shown in the frequent styling of his works as poems or fantasies, and the fact that virtually every single piece by him carries a descriptive or poetic title, often literary. Holbrooke's imagination was essentially illustrative:\n\nAlthough Holbrooke's choral writing could occasionally be unadventurous and somewhat four-square, as in the poem for chorus and orchestra \"Byron\", there are effects of startling originality elsewhere, ranging from the vocal use of the acciaccatura in \"The Bells\" to the multi-layered chorus of shouted warcries in the final act of \"Bronwen\". The solo vocal writing in the mature operas, whilst not strictly comparable with verismo, is generally declamatory and follows naturalistic speech-rhythms: in this sense at least, along with many of his contemporaries, Holbrooke was indebted to Wagner although his musical idiom is more dissonant. Indeed, from the 1920s onwards his music gained a noticeably increased harmonic astringency:\n\nHowever, his occasional forays into atonalism in piano works such as \"Four Futurist Dances\" and \"Bogey Beasts\" were uncharacteristic and intended as caricature:\n\nPerhaps it was due to his early experience in the music hall that several of his melodies have a distinctly populist feel, for example the syncopated first subject in the final movement of the early Sextet in F minor.\n\nThe tendency towards the pictorial rather than the abstract in his music undoubtedly stemmed from Holbrooke's tuition at the Royal Academy: his reputation, along with that of other composers (including Granville Bantock and Arnold Bax) who studied under Frederick Corder, an ardent Wagnerian, has consequently suffered from what has been perceived as a lack of rigorous musical thought and an assumed want of self-criticism:\n\nOther assessments of Holbrooke's music have been considerably more positive:\n\nOnly a small fraction of Holbrooke's large output has been recorded, although he was deeply interested in promoting his music through various reproductive formats. Scott-Ellis financed several gramophone recordings including excerpts from \"The Cauldron of Annwn\", most notably from the final opera of the trilogy, \"Bronwen\". Issued by Columbia, these were positively received:\n\nOther recordings appeared intermittently throughout the 1930s, including a coupling of the \"Dylan\" Prelude and the finale of Holbrooke's third symphony (both abridged) on Decca:\n\nAnother highlight was Paxton's 1949 recording of the piano concerto \"The Song of Gwyn ap Nudd\" played by Grace Lyndon with the London Promenade Orchestra conducted by Arthur Hammond (1904-1991).\n\nIn 1993 several of these historical recordings were re-issued on compact disc by Symposium. Besides gramophone records, Holbrooke oversaw the production of a large number of pianola and organ rolls of his music including abridged arrangements of \"Apollo and the Seaman\", the overture to \"Children of Don\", the overture to \"Bronwen\", \"Queen Mab\", \"The Viking\", \"The Raven\", \"The Wilfowl\", the variations on \"Three Blind Mice\" and \"Auld Lang Syne\", and the second piano concerto \"L'Orient\". Few of his works were commercially recorded in the three decades following the composer's death in 1958, notable exceptions being \"The Birds of Rhiannon\" and \"The Song of Gwyn ap Nudd\", although the BBC did broadcast a number of studio performances.\n\nThe advent of the compact disc has, however, brought a revival of interest: Marco Polo issued two orchestral discs and one chamber music disc, Hyperion included \"The Song of Gywn ap Nudd\" in its ongoing \"Romantic Piano Concerto\" series and Lyrita reissued their recording of \"The Birds of Rhiannon\". More recently, several other companies have shown an interest in recording Holbrooke, including CPO, Dutton, Naxos and Cameo Classics.\n\nHis students included the conductor and composer Anthony Bernard.\n\nThe English composer and bassist Gavin Bryars paid tribute to Holbrooke by giving the name Joseph Holbrooke to his collective free-improvising trio with Derek Bailey and Tony Oxley. Despite the name, the group never played Holbrooke's compositions.\n\nHolbrooke Court, Parkhurst Road, Islington built in 1974 is named after him.\n\n"}

Huss grew up in New York City, the son of German immigrant parents. After studying piano and organ locally with a teacher who had trained at the Leipzig Conservatory, Huss traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Conservatory with Josef Rheinberger. His fellow students at the Royal Music School in Munich included Arthur Whiting and H. W. Parker. After graduating, he returned to the States and embarked on a career as a touring piano virtuoso. As a composer, he was regarded as one of the best of his generation by those who counted, but unfortunately, it was at a time when American composers could rarely get a hearing for their works.\n\nAn exhaustive study of Huss' life and music, with a complete catalog of compositions, has been published: Henry Holden Huss: An American Composer's Life, by Gary A. Greene (1995, Scarecrow Press (Metuchen NJ and London)), .\n\nHis 1886 Piano Trio in D minor, Op. 23, subtitled \"The Munich\" and dedicated to Rheinberger, was premiered with considerable acclaim and a number of other performances followed. However, the work remained unpublished until 2008 when Edition Silvertrust brought out the world premiere edition.

Poor. The line was intended to link Portland (the eastern terminus of the US rail network) with an ice-free Atlantic port in Nova Scotia to connect with fast trans-Atlantic ships from Europe; the port at Halifax was discussed as a possible eastern terminus for the line, as was Canso.\n\nThe concept was also discussed throughout the early 1850s in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Maine as a means to connect the British colonies with the railway network of the United Province of Canada. Poor himself was also promoting a connection from Portland to Richmond and built the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad (SL&A), opening in 1853, the same year it was purchased by Grand Trunk. Poor stood to benefit from a dual flow of traffic from the Maritimes to New England and the Maritimes to the Canadas.\n\nThe railway most commonly referred to as the E&NA in Canada was built between Saint John and Shediac, New Brunswick as a segment of Poor’s vision of a Portland-Nova Scotia line.\n\nThe initial ownership of the line is unclear, however the European and North American Railway was incorporated in New Brunswick on March 15, 1851, following the Portland conference, with the intention being to start construction east toward Nova Scotia. Both Saint John, and St. Andrews, New Brunswick were vying for the E&NA to begin in their respective communities; however Saint John managed to convince the company to begin on the east side of the Saint John River.\n\nSaint John also convinced the company to forego plans to build into Nova Scotia by concentrating on reaching the Northumberland Strait first. This would give the city a steamship connection through the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Canada East, as well as allowing coal and other goods to avoid the circuitous and hazardous transit around Nova Scotia.\n\nConstruction started in 1853, heading northeast from Saint John up the Kennebecasis River valley. Unfortunately construction did not proceed very far and the company went bankrupt in 1856 with the colonial government of New Brunswick taking over the company’s line in 1857.\nThat year (1857) saw construction proceed apace under a newly reincorporated government-owned European and North American Railway Co. Canada’s first civil engineering graduate, H.G.C. Ketchum, of the University of New Brunswick, was employed in the surveying and construction of the line. Ketchum surveyed a high-capacity railway with long tangent sections and minimal grades between Saint John and Moncton.\n\nThe first section of the E&NA opened between Shediac and Moncton on August 20, 1857, a distance of . Although the Shediac-Moncton section was the first part opened, the line was soon extended 2 miles east to the better wharf facilities at Point du Chene. The line had been surveyed to extend from Cape Brule 2 miles further east of Point du Chene, however the sheltered harbour at Point du Chene won out over the more exposed Cape Brule location.\n\nMeanwhile, the line between Hampton, New Brunswick and Saint John opened in 1859 and the remaining section between Moncton and Hampton was opened in 1860. In 1860, the colony of New Brunswick issued a postage stamp which illustrated an E&NA engine. The stamp was commissioned by the postmaster and one of the railway's directors, Charles Connell.\n\nUnfortunately, the E&NA never progressed east from Moncton to its stated goal of Nova Scotia. By the late 1850s, the Nova Scotia Railway had already built a line from Halifax to Truro, Nova Scotia, with a stated ambition of building westward to link with the E&NA in New Brunswick; thus the E&NA stood with its Saint John-Shediac line for several years. The missing link between Truro and Moncton was finally built by the Intercolonial Railway, completed in 1872.\n\nThe E&NA’s \"Eastern Extension\" locomotive shops and headquarters were located in Shediac until it was taken over by the Intercolonial Railway, which then moved them to Moncton.\n\nLess well-known was the railway most commonly referred to as the E&NA Western Extension which was built between South Bay, New Brunswick (immediately west of Saint John) and St. Croix on the International Boundary with Maine.\n\nOn April 13, 1864, the colonial government in New Brunswick incorporated a company called the European and North American Railway for extension from Saint John westward to build the \"Western Extension\" of the E&NA system. The 90-mile railway was surveyed later that year and a contract for construction was awarded to E.R. Burpee. On November 9, 1865, the first sod was turned at South Bay by the mayor of Saint John. By August 14, 1869 the line was opened between South Bay and Hartts Mills (later renamed Fredericton Junction). On November 17, 1869 the line was completely opened from the Maine border at St. Croix east to Saint John.\n\nThe E&NA incorporated in the State of Maine as the European and North American Railway on August 20, 1850. Subsequent delays over the next 15 years saw its charter revised to run from Bangor to Vanceboro, Maine on the International Boundary opposite St. Croix, New Brunswick.\n\nConstruction finally began with the section from Bangor to Olamon, Maine, opening in 1868 and Olamon to Mattawamkeag, Maine, opening in 1869. The 114 mile line was finally completed to Vanceboro in October 1871, linking the E&NA (Maine) to the E&NA (Western Extension) at Vanceboro-St. Croix. A ceremony celebrating completion of the line was attended by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and Canadian Governor General Lord Lisgar at the boundary bridge crossing the St. Croix River.\n\nOn November 9, 1872, the Eastern Division was consolidated, along with the Nova Scotia Railway, into the Intercolonial Railway. On the other hand, the Maine and Western companies were merged on December 1, 1872 as the Consolidated European and North American Railway, which defaulted on its bonds in 1875. The Western Extension bondholders organized the St. John and Maine Railway on March 29, 1878, and acquired the property in New Brunswick on August 31. The New Brunswick Railway leased this line on July 1, 1883. The Maine property was similarly reorganized under its original name - European and North American Railway - in October 1880. The Maine Central Railroad leased this line on April 1, 1882.\n\nAlthough the entire Portland to Halifax line that was envisioned at the Portland conference in 1850 was not built by the E&NA per se, several portions of this system were completed by other companies as follows:\n\n\nAn express passenger train known as the \"Gull\" was jointly operated over this route by the various owners from 1930 to 1960.\n\nAlthough the Portland to Halifax railway line remains in operation, various sections of the line have undergone several corporate changes over the years:\n\nThe Intercolonial Railway (ICR) took over the Nova Scotia Railway and E&NA \"Eastern Extension\" on November 9, 1872, following completion of its connection between Truro and Moncton. The E&NA \"Eastern Extension\" was standard gauged on November 11, 1872.\n\nThe Intercolonial Railway came under the control of the Canadian Government Railways (CGR) in 1915. CGR was merged into the Canadian National Railways (CNR) in 1918. CN continues to operate these lines, although the Shediac spur has been cut back to Scoudouc, New Brunswick.\n\nThe E&NA \"Western Extension\" was operated by the New Brunswick government separately from the E&NA \"Eastern Extension\" and thus did not get included in the takeover by the Intercolonial Railway, which was focused exclusively on building and operating a railway from Halifax to Quebec. The E&NA \"Western Extension\" was standard gauged by 1877.\n\nThe E&NA \"Western Extension\" became part of the New Brunswick Railway (NBR) in 1883. On July 1, 1890, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) secured a lease for 999 years for the NBR. CPR applied to abandon the line effective January 1, 1995, however it was subsequently taken over by New Brunswick Southern Railway which continues to operate the line today.\n\nThe E&NA \"Maine\" was operated separately from its completion in 1871 until it was leased to the Maine Central Railroad (MEC) in 1882. In 1889 the International Railway of Maine was built by Canadian Pacific Railway from Megantic, Quebec to the MEC at Mattawamkeag, Maine The MEC granted trackage rights to the CPR over the 56 mile section from Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro at that time.\n\nIn November 1955, MEC purchased the entire 114 mile E&NA \"Maine\" for US$125 per share or US$3,114,500 payable in cash or bonds. On December 17, 1974, the CPR purchased the 56 mile Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro section from MEC for US$5.4 million, although MEC maintained trackage rights. MEC maintained ownership of the 58 mile Bangor to Mattawamkeag section. In 1981, MEC was purchased by Guilford Rail System, which continues to operate the Bangor to Mattawamkeag section.\n\nCPR applied to abandon the Mattawamkeag-Vanceboro section effective January 1, 1995, however it was subsequently taken over by Eastern Maine Railway which continues to operate the line.\n\nThe Maine Central was created in 1862 and was sold to Guilford Rail System (GRS) in 1981. GRS continues to operate the line as of 2005.\n"}

The story is about a black female vigilante played by Pam Grier who seeks violent revenge against \na heroin dealer responsible for her sister's addiction.\n\nThe film's tagline in advertising was \"They call her 'Coffy' and she'll cream you!\"\n\nA nurse, last name \"Coffin\" but usually referred to as \"Coffy\", seeks revenge against the people responsible for her younger sister Lubelle's heroin addiction and the widespread violence that exists in her city. Under the guise of a prostitute willing to do anything for a drug fix, she lures a drug pusher and a mob boss to their residences, killing them. After the killings, Coffy returns to her job at a local hospital operating room.\n\nAfter her shift, Coffy’s police friend Carter offers to drive her home. Carter is a straight-shooting officer who is not willing to bend the law for the mob or the thugs who have been bribing officers at his precinct. Coffy doesn't believe his strong moral resolve until two hooded men break into Carter's house while she's visiting him and beat Carter severely, temporarily crippling him. This enrages Coffy, giving her further provocation to continue her work as a vigilante, killing those responsible for harming Carter and her sister.\n\nCoffy's boyfriend, Howard Brunswick, is a city councilman. Coffy admires Brunswick for his contributions to the community. Brunswick announces his plan to run for Congress, and his purchase of a night club. Coffy is pleased with these developments. \n\nCoffy's next targets are a pimp named King George, one of the largest suppliers of prostitutes and illegal drugs in the city, and Mafia boss Arturo Vittroni, a criminal associate of George's.\n\nCoffy questions a former patient of hers, who is a known drug user, to gain insight into the type of woman King George likes and where he keeps his stash of drugs. Coffy shows no sympathy for the drug-addled woman and is abusive to her as she looks for answers. Coffy is on a mission of revenge and no one will stand in her way. With the information she gets from the woman, Coffy tracks down George and poses as a Jamaican woman looking to trick for him. \n\nGeorge is immediately interested in her exotic nature and hires her. One of the prostitutes becomes jealous when she sees King George taking an interest in Coffy. Later that day, Coffy and the other prostitutes get into a massive brawl. Coffy wins out, which attracts mob boss Vittroni who demands that he must have her that night.\n\nCoffy plans to murder Vitroni and just when she is about to shoot, she is overtaken by his men. She lies and tells Vitroni that King George ordered her to kill him, which makes Vitroni order George to be murdered. Vitroni's men kill George by tying him by the neck from their car, which they drive through an open field.\n\nCoffy then discovers Brunswick, her clean-cut boyfriend, is corrupt when she's shown to him at a meeting of the mob and several police officials. He denies knowing her other than as a prostitute and Coffy is sent to her death. Coffy uses her sexuality to seduce her would-be killers. They try injecting her with drugs to sedate her, but she had replaced the illicit drugs with a sugar solution earlier. Faking a high, she kills her unsuspecting hitmen with a pointed metal wire she fashioned herself and hid in her hair.\n\nRunning to avoid capture, Coffy carjacks a vehicle to escape. Coffy drives to Vitroni's house, murders him, and then goes to Brunswick's to do the same. He pleads for forgiveness and just as she is about to accept, a naked white woman comes out of his bedroom. Coffy shoots Brunswick in the groin. The film then closes with Coffy walking along the beach having avenged her sister.\n\nAccording to writer/director Hill, the project began when American International Pictures' head of production, Larry Gordon, lost the rights to the film \"Cleopatra Jones\" after making a handshake deal with the producers. Gordon subsequently approached Hill to quickly make a movie about an African-American woman's revenge and beat \"Cleopatra Jones\" to market. Hill wanted to work with Pam Grier, whom he had worked with on \"The Big Doll House\" (1971). The film ended up earning more money than \"Cleopatra Jones\" and established Grier as an icon of the genre.\n\n\"Coffy\" is notable in its depiction of a strong black female lead (a professional nurse), something rare in the genre at the time, and also in its then-unfashionable anti-drug message.\n\n\nThe movie received a mixed reception.\nKaren Ross wrote that it \"let black audiences enjoy the sight of heroes kicking the white system and winning even while condemning the violence and recognized the implausibility. It allowed blacks the ultimate escape to cheer on the heroine that fought corruption and crime and then leave the theatre to be blighted by the racism in society.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"Jack Hill, who wrote and directs with an action-atuned hand, inserts plenty of realism in footage in which Pam Grier in title role ably acquits herself.\" Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, praising the film for its believable female lead and noting that Grier was an actress of \"beautiful face and astonishing form\" and that she possessed a kind of \"physical life\" missing from many other attractive actresses. Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \"a stupid movie\" with a \"wooden performance\" from Grier. Fredric Milstein called it \"very well-made, very filthy and obscenely violent,\" adding that director Hill \"elicits convincing, interesting performances from everybody except Miss Grier, who reads her lines rather stiffly and childishly and who shouldn't be able to fool anyone — especially not the Prince of Pushers — with that phony Jamaican accent she uses when she goes undercover.\"\n\nGrier subsequently played similar characters in the AIP films \"Foxy Brown\" (1974), \"Friday Foster\", and \"Sheba, Baby\" (both 1975).\n\nThe film is a favourite of Quentin Tarantino, and he ranks it high among his top 20 best films. He later hired Grier for \"Jackie Brown\" in 1997, a film with clear inspiration from films like \"Coffy\" and \"Foxy Brown\". Tarantino said of the film poster: \"Not only is it a great image of Pam Grier, it's got great type — it's the epitome of a great exploitation poster...and every version of it in foreign countries rocked.\"\n\nBy 1976 \"Variety\" estimated the film had earned $4 million in rentals.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nDue to sequels performing poorly at the box-office, the sequel to \"Coffy\" (known as \"Burn Coffy Burn\") was scrapped and replaced with \"Foxy Brown\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

After mentioning Johannes Brahms and others, Altmann writes, “He produced a number of chamber works, which . . . need fear no comparison.”\n\nKiel was born in Bad Laasphe, Puderbach. He was taught the rudiments of music and received his first piano lessons from his father, but was in large part self-taught. Something of a prodigy, he played the piano almost without instruction at the age of six, and by his thirteenth year he had composed much music. Kiel eventually came to the attention of Prince Albrecht Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, a great music lover. Through the Prince's efforts, Kiel was allowed to study violin with the concertmaster of the Prince’s fine orchestra with which he later performed as a soloist. Kiel was also given theory lessons from the renowned flautist Kaspar Kummer. By 1840, the eighteen-year-old Kiel was court conductor and the music teacher to the prince’s children. Two years later, Louis Spohr heard him and arranged for a scholarship which allowed Kiel to study in Berlin with the renowned theorist and teacher Siegfried Dehn. In Berlin, Kiel eventually became sought after as an instructor. In 1866, he received a teaching position at the prestigious Stern conservatory, where he taught composition and was elevated to a professorship three years later. In 1870 he joined the faculty of the newly founded Hochschule für Musik which was shortly thereafter considered one of the finest music schools in Germany. For his many students \n\nKiel's hobby was mountaineering and at age 60, he climbed Europe's second highest peak, the Monte Rosa, on the Swiss-Italian border. In September 1883 he was involved in a traffic accident with a coach. His injuries eventually forced him to retire shortly before his death in September 1885.\n\nKiel's compositions number over seventy, including a piano concerto, motets, oratorios (including the \"Star of Bethlehem\"), as well as a \"Missa Solemnis\" and two \"Requiems\".\n\nChamber music comprises a considerable part of Kiel's output and must be regarded among his most important and best compositions. (See list below) Altmann noted that, \"throughout my long life, I have found Kiel’s chamber music a never-failing source of delight.” He praised Kiel highly as a melodist and lamented that it was “scandalously unjust” that Kiel’s two string quartets were as good as forgotten. Writing about Kiel's two Piano Quintets Opp. 75 & 76 in \"The Chamber Music Journal\", R. H. R. Silvertrust remarks, \"Both of these quintets are as fine as any in the entire literature.\" Several of his chamber works, along with the piano concerto and some choral works, have been recorded.\n\n\n"}

She is widely regarded as a pioneer of women's liberation in South Asia.\n\nShe advocated for men and women to be treated equally as rational beings, noting that the lack of education for women was responsible for their inferior economic position. Her major works include \"Matichur\" (A String of Sweet Pearls, 1904 and 1922), a collection of essays in two volumes expressing her feminist thoughts; \"Sultana's Dream\" (1908), a feminist science fiction novella set in Ladyland ruled by women; \"Padmarag\" (\"Essence of the Lotus\", 1924) depicting the difficulties faced by Bengali wives; and \"Abarodhbasini\" (The Confined Women, 1931), a spirited attack on the extreme forms of purdah that endangered women's lives and self-image.\n\nRokeya held education to be the central precondition of women's liberation, establishing the first school aimed primarily at Muslim girls in Kolkata. She is said to have gone from house to house persuading the parents to send their girls to her school in Nisha. Until her death, she ran the school despite facing hostile criticism and social obstacles.\n\nIn 1916, she founded the Muslim Women's Association, an organization that fought for women's education and employment. In 1926, Rokeya presided over the Bengal Women's Education Conference convened in Kolkata, the first significant attempt to bring women together in support of women's education rights. She was engaged in debates and conferences regarding the advancement of women until her death on 9 December 1932, shortly after presiding over a session during the Indian Women's Conference.\n\nBangladesh observes \"Rokeya Day\" on 9 December every year to commemorate her works and legacy. On that day, Bangladesh government also confers Begum Rokeya Padak on individual women for their exceptional achievement. In 2004, Rokeya was ranked number 6 in BBC's poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time.\n\nRoquiah Khatun was born in 1880 in Pairaband village, Rangpur in the-then British India. Her ancestors served in the military and judiciary during the Mughal regime. Her father, Jahiruddin Muhammad Abu Ali Haidar Saber, was a \"zamindar\" and a multi-lingual intellectual. He married four times; his marriage to Rahatunnessa resulted in the birth of Rokeya, who had two sisters and three brothers, one of whom died in childhood. Rokeya's eldest brother Ibrahim Saber, and her immediate elder sister Karimunnesa Khanam Chaudhurani, both had a major influence on her life. Karimunnesa wanted to study Bengali, the language of the majority in Bengali people, against her family's wish who preferred to use Arabic and Persian as the media of education. Ibrahim taught English and Bengali to Rokeya and Karimunnesa. Karimunnesa married at the age of fourteen and later became a poet. Both of her sons, Abdul Karim Ghaznavi and Abdul Halim Ghaznavi, became politicians and occupied ministerial portfolios under British authorities.\n\nRokeya married at the age of 18, in 1898 to 38-year-old Khan Bahadur Sakhawat Hussain. He was an Urdu-speaking deputy magistrate of Bhagalpur (a present-day district of Bihar state). He earned his bachelor of agriculture degree from England and was a member of Royal Agricultural Society of England. He married Rokeya after the death of his first wife. As a liberal, he encouraged Rokeya to continue learning Bengali and English. He also encouraged her to write, and on his advice, she adopted Bengali as the principal language for her literary works.\n\nRokeya launched her literary career in 1902 with a Bengali essay entitled \"Pipasa\" (\"Thirst\"). She later published the books \"Matichur\" (1905) and \"Sultana's Dream\" (1908) before her husband died in 1909. In \"Sultana's Dream\", Rokeya wrote reversing the roles of men and women in which women were the dominant sex and the men were subordinate. She also depicts an alternative, feminist vision of science, in which inventions such as solar ovens, flying cars, and cloud condensers are used to benefit the whole of society.\nIt is regarded as a notable and influential satire. She wrote regularly for the \"Saogat\", \"Mahammadi\", \"Nabaprabha\", \"Mahila\", \"Bharatmahila\", \"Al-Eslam\", \"Nawroz\", \"Mahe Nao\", \"Bangiya Musalman Sahitya Patrika\", \"The Mussalman\", \"Indian Ladies Magazine\" and others.\n\nFive months after Rokeya's husband's death, she established a high school, naming it Sakhawat Memorial Girls' High School. It started in Bhagalpur, a traditionally Urdu-speaking area, with five students. A dispute with her husband's family over property forced her to move the school in 1911 to Calcutta, a Bengali-speaking area. She ran the school for 24 years.\n\nRokeya founded the Anjuman-e-Khawateen-e-Islam (Islamic Women's Association), which was active in holding debates and conferences regarding the status of women and education. She advocated reform, particularly for women, and believed that parochialism and excessive conservatism were principally responsible for the relatively slow development of Muslims in British India. Anjuman-e-Khawateen-e-Islam organised events for social reforms based on the original teachings of Islam that, according to her, were lost.\n\nRokeya wrote a number of genres, short stories, poems, essays, novels and satirical writings, developing a distinctive literary style, characterised by creativity, logic and a wry sense of humour. She started writing in the \"Nabanoor\" from about 1903, under the name of Mrs R S Hossain. However, there is an opinion that her first published writing \"Pipasa\" appeared in the \"Nabaprabha\" in 1902. Her writings called upon women to protest against injustices and break the social barriers that discriminated against them.\n\n\nRokeya died of heart problems on 9 December 1932, on her 52nd birthday. 9 December is celebrated as Rokeya Day in Bangladesh.\n\nRokeya's grave in Sodepur was rediscovered due to the efforts of the historian Amalendu De.\nRokeya is considered as the pioneer feminist of Bengal. Universities, public buildings and a National Award has been named after her in Bangladesh. She was an inspiration for many later generation female authors including Sufia Kamal, Tahmima Anam, and others.\n\nOn December 9, 2017, Google celebrated her 137th birthday with a Google Doodle.\n\n\n"}

He is also sometimes called in the Chinese tradition \"Hufa Weituo Zuntian Pusa\", meaning \"Honored Dharma Protector Skanda Bodhisattva\", because he is the leader of the twenty-four celestial guardian deities mentioned in the \"Golden Light Sutra\".\n\nIn Chinese temples, Skanda faces the statue of the Buddha in the main shrine. In others, he is on the far right of the main shrine, whereas on the left is his counterpart, Sangharama (personified as the historical general Guan Yu). In Chinese sutras, his image is found at the end of the sutra, a reminder of his vow to protect and preserve the teachings.\n\nAccording to legends, Skanda was the son of a virtuous king who had complete faith in Buddha's teachings. When the Buddha entered nirvana, the Buddha instructed Skanda to guard the Dharma. It was his duty to protect members of the sangha when they are disturbed by Mara, the tempter, and also to resolve conflicts amongst members of the sangha. A few days after the Buddha's passing and cremation, evil demons stole his relics. Skanda's vow of protecting the faith and Dharma was proven when he managed to defeat the evil demons and returned the relics.\n\nStories vary on how Skanda was accepted into the traditional Chinese Buddhist pantheon. Some have proposed that Skanda's features were adapted from a Chinese deity who appeared in the Chinese classical Ming novel \"Fengshen Yanyi\". However, the existence of illustrated Skanda images predating the Ming Dynasty set his origins back to an earlier period in the development of Chinese Buddhism.\n\nSkanda is described as a young man fully clad in the armor and headgear of a Chinese general, and is usually leaning on a vajra staff. Some suggest that Skanda may have come from Hinduism as the war deity Kartikeya / Muruga / Kandha- கந்தா (Tamil), who bears the title Skanda. Others point out that Skanda might also be a manifestation of Vajrapani, a bodhisattva who bears some relations to Skanda because they both wield vajras as weapons, are portrayed with flaming halos, and are both heavenly protectors of Buddhism. Skanda may be connected through Vajrapani through a theory to his connection to Greco-Buddhism, as Wei Tuo's image is reminiscent of the Heracles depiction of Vajrapani.\n\nAlthough Skanda is only a deva, he is very often addressed as a bodhisattva.\n\nWhen the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was reincarnated as the princess Miao Shan, Skanda (known as Wei Tuo in this story) was one of her cruel father's generals. He loved Miao Shan but realized he could not possibly be a proper partner to her, since she was a pure person. However, Wei Tuo was inspired by Miao Shan's kindness so he decided to stay faithful and devoted to Miao Shan, even if she wasn't his wife. The two escaped Miao Shan's father, and the general-suitor helped build Miao Shan a temple and a kingdom of her own. Soon however, the cruel king found them and killed them both. The general, because of his devotion to Guan Yin, transformed into a bodhisattva himself, who vowed to always serve and protect Guan Yin. His appearance as a Chinese general is the direct forebear to his connection with Miao Shan.\n\nAnother story says that Miao Shan was told to commit suicide by her grandmother. Her grandmother forced Miao Shan to leap into the sea because she was thought to have been an incarnation of a demon, when in fact she was not. The emperor told a loyal soldier named Luo Ping to pretend to throw Miao Shan into the ocean. He brought her with Yin Ma, the mother of Wei Tuo, to her village. Years passed, when an evil fish demon came. A disloyal soldier named Huo Yi was sent by the fish demon to kill Miao Shan. The fish demon wanted revenge on Miao Shan because she was the incarnation of \"Ci Hang Da Shi\", a Buddhist deva that put the fish in a lotus pond. Huo Yi and his troops went to the village where Miao Shan and Wei Tuo lived and fought. Huo Yi's son killed Wei Tuo. After Miao Shan became the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, she made Skanda a bodhisattva guardian. He became a bodhisattva because he took care of Miao Shan and loved her as a sister.\n\nAccording to the lunar calendar, his birthday is the 3rd day of the 6th lunar month.\n\n"}
{"id": "2066627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066627", "title": "Agranat Commission", "text": "Agranat Commission\n\nThe Agranat Commission (Hebrew: ועדת אגרנט) was a National Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate failings in the Israel Defense Forces in the prelude to the Yom Kippur War, when Israel was found unprepared for the Egyptian attack against the Bar Lev Line and a simultaneous attack by Syria in the Golan—the first phase in a war in which 2,812 Israeli soldiers were killed.\n\nThe commission was an official National Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Israeli government to investigate the circumstances leading to the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. The Committee was headed by Shimon Agranat, Chief Justice of Israel's Supreme Court. Its other members were Justice Moshe Landau, State Comptroller Yitzchak Nebenzahl, and former Chiefs of Staff Yigael Yadin and Chaim Laskov. The Committee sat for 140 sessions, during which they listened to the testimony of 58 witnesses. It was established on 21 November 1973 with a remit to investigate:\n\nIt did not examine the later stages of the war when the IDF went on the offensive.\n\nOn 31 December 1973, elections that had been delayed by the war took place. Likud, a new political party, won 39 seats in the Knesset. Newly elected Member of Knesset and one of the Likud founders, Reserve General Ariel Sharon gave a newspaper interview in which he was quoted as saying that he would disobey orders that he felt were against the interests of the State or his subordinates. This caused so much public concern that Sharon was asked to appear before the Commission, which accepted his testimony that the quote was in the context of a specific event which occurred under very exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe commission's report was published in three parts. The interim report, released 1 April 1974, called for the dismissal of a number of senior officers in the IDF and caused such controversy that Prime Minister Golda Meir was forced to resign. The second part was published 10 July 1974 and contained the reasons for the conclusions of the first report. The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975. One consequence of the Commission's investigation was the \"Basic Law: The Army (1975)\", clarifying the IDF's legal status.\n\nPublished on 1 April 1974, the Interim Report caused a sensation. Its headline recommendation was the dismissal of four senior officers in military intelligence: The Chief of Military Intelligence Major General Eliyahu Zeira, his deputy Brigadier Aryeh Shalev, the head of the Egyptian Department Lt Colonel Yona Bendman, and the chief intelligence officer in the Southern Command Lt Colonel David Gedalia. The report also was critical of what it called the \"concept\" in military intelligence thinking. The \"concept\" was based on the assumption that Egypt would only attack if it had the air-power to take on the Israeli Air Force. Military intelligence also thought that Syria would only attack if Egypt did. In the absence of any upgrading of Egypt's air force, the directorate concluded there was no threat of imminent war. This assumption led to complacency and evidence being ignored. For example, on 1 October and again on 3 October 1973, Lieutenant Benjamin Siman Yov, order of battle intelligence officer for the Southern Command, gave his superior Lt Colonel Gadalia documents indicating Egypt's war preparations.\n\nIn its examination of the senior echelons of the IDF, the commission also concluded that GOC Southern Command Shmuel Gonen should be dismissed. After his departure, Gonen argued that he had only been in the post for a few months and that the command had been neglected by his predecessor Ariel Sharon.\nThe Commission also found Chief of Staff David Elazar responsible, but it refused to give an opinion on the responsibility of the Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan, arguing that this was beyond its remit.\n\nThis report caused public uproar and unhappiness in the army. In Abba Eban's words \"The conclusions ... did not seem to accord with the narrative\" Yitzhak Rabin walked out of the cabinet with Elazar. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. Nine days after the publication of the Interim Report, Golda Meir announced the resignation of her government.\n\nAfter his dismissal, Elazar maintained that had he been given more of the information, he would have mobilized the IDF sooner. This only confirmed the Commission's criticisms about the reliance on a single avenue for intelligence analysis. Elazar died two years later aged 48.\n\nThe final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975. The completed report was 1,500 pages long, with 746 pages devoted to the fighting in the south and 311 to the northern front. Forty two pages were made public, the remainder being classified. Besides the IDF's failures, it looked at the issues around civilian and political control of the army and found a \"lack of clear definitions...\". Surprisingly, they could not find a clear statement of civilian control over the military. They argued that the Basic Law: The Cabinet (1968) implied authority when it stated that the Cabinet has authority over all areas not covered by other legislation. Later critics argued that the Cabinet's authority stemmed from the IDF Order (1948), which authorised the Minister of Defence to set up the army. Further questions arose over hundreds of orders issued by Chiefs of Staff since 1948 without authorisation from the Minister of Defence. These discoveries led to the swift enactment of Basic Law: The Army (1975). Its main clause stated:\n\nThe new law still left some issues unresolved, such as who appoints a Chief of Staff and whether the Chief of Staff was the most senior officer in the army.\n\nIn practice, the controversy about the report's absence of criticism of Moshe Dayan led to a strengthening of the Chief of Staff's position since he could argue that if the Chief of Staff had sole responsibility, it must be the Chief of Staff's decision. The Chief of Staff was now a regular attender of cabinet meetings.\n\nThe Commission was critical of the standard of everyday discipline in the IDF: \"Discipline is indivisible. For example, a soldier who becomes accustomed in time of peace not to observe the minor rules, such as in matters of personal appearance, without being alerted to this failure by his superior officer, will in the end be negligent in carrying out operational orders.\"\n\nAs a response to the Commission's criticism of using military intelligence as the sole route for analysis of information, the Foreign Ministry established a Research and Planning Department. Despite this, five years later the 29th Comptrollers Report into the conduct of the IDF during Operation Litani, which left 21 IDF soldiers dead, concluded that conditions remained the same as in 1973. The Report's author was Yitzhak Nebenzahl, a member of the Agranat Commission.\n\nThe full text of the report, except for 48 pages, was made public 1 January 1995.\n\nThe findings of the Agranat Commission have been the focus of sharp debate among the Israeli public up until today. Particular criticism relates to its exoneration of the country's political leadership, especially Defense Minister Dayan. According to the Report: \"As long as he accepts the opinions of his advisers, he does not bear any personal responsibility.\"\n\nFurther criticism responds to the Commission's recommendations, stemming from the failure of military intelligence to assess the Arab states' intent, that the IDF should not consider the intentions of hostile states, but rather their capacity for war. Thirty years later, Giora Eiland, head of the National Security Council, wrote: \"Both the proscription against considering intent and the concentration on the prevention of threats—two central messages of the Agranat Commission [Report]—frustrated and delayed the rebuilding and preparedness of the IDF for years.\"\n\n\n"}

Hellfest was known for its fan-friendly atmosphere, (including a lack of barriers, providing easy access to the stage for stage diving) and for its high social-awareness, focusing on such causes as animal rights, with many attendees following the straight edge and/or vegan lifestyle. It continued as an annual event until it was cancelled in 2005. After its cancellation less than thirty-six hours before doors were scheduled to open on the festival's ninth year, some fans, unhappy with the inadequate processing of refunds, filed small claims court lawsuits against promoter Keith Allen.\n\nIn its ninth season in 2005 (which was cancelled), Hellfest was to feature independent hardcore, metal and punk rock bands on three different stages. However, discrepancies between Paper Street Music (Hellfest's organizer and promoter) and the venue caused the fest to be cancelled at the last minute.

A classically trained pianist, Mazich became interested in playing the organ after hearing the classic Deep Purple album \"Machine Head\"; he also counts jazz organ pioneer Jimmy Smith as an influence.\n\nA veteran of several San Pedro, California cover bands, Mazich first met and worked with Watt in a project band Watt was involved with, The Madonnabes, which devoted itself to reinterpreting the songs of Madonna. From there, Watt asked Mazich and another Madonnabes member, drummer Jerry Trebotic, to help record a song for a 1998 compilation album benefiting Doctors Without Borders, under the group name Mike Watt & Masina.\n\nIn 2002, Mazich was asked to join Watt as organist in a new band that would record and tour behind Watt's third solo album, \"The Secondman's Middle Stand\". His initial tours with Watt in 2002 and 2003 would end several weeks early for him because of time constraints related to his day job at a pet food lab; by the fall of 2003 he was able to resign from the job and be able to work as a longshoreman in between Watt tours.

Mazich proceeded to fulfill a lifelong dream of his when he became an endorsee of Hammond Organs during the tour.\n\nMazich's work ethic and love for music led Mike Watt to point out almost frequently that Mazich was his \"rock\", adding that the name Peter happens to come from the Greek word for \"rock\", \"pietros\".\n\nMazich continues to play with Watt & The Secondmen's original lineup for special Los Angeles-area gigs. He is also leading his own band, Johnny Angry. The group had started under the name Pipe, only to discover that another band was using that name. They then went with AMF (Angry Mother Fuckers) but changed to their present collective moniker to avoid legal conflicts with the AMF known for its bowling equipment and centers. Johnny Angry released a self-titled EP in 2006. Johnny Angry later became The Angry upon release of their first self-titled Album in October 2009 on Shab Records. The band later disbanded it May 2010 after the death of bass player Scott Cieszki in February of that same year.\n\nMazich has been married twice; he lives in San Pedro with his second wife, Ljiljana Nikolovska, a former pop star in her native Croatia and former Yugoslavia.

It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International. The Beau Rivage hotel is the tallest building in Mississippi. The term 'Beau Rivage' is French for 'beautiful shore'; the original, well-known hotels of that name are the Beau-Rivage Geneva and Beau-Rivage Palace, both in Francophone Switzerland.\n\nThe name of Beau Rivage was originally meant for the Bellagio casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip, however, developer Steve Wynn of Mirage Resorts changed Beau Rivage into Bellagio, and reserved this name for his new waterfront casino in Biloxi.\n\nThe Beau Rivage, with 1,740 rooms, opened in March 1999. At that time of its opening, it was the largest hotel/casino in the United States outside of Nevada. The casino was located on a series of floating barges as required by local law confining all casinos to mobile marine vessels at the time of the resort's construction. The hotel, restaurants, parking garage, and associated facilities were constructed on land. The height of the 29-floor hotel-casino is .\n\nBeau Rivage was seriously damaged by the storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, and was rebuilt by W.G. Yates & Sons Construction (the contractor that originally built it) and more than 50 subcontractors. Beau Rivage Resort & Casino re-opened its entire resort August 29, 2006 — the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Although the hotel tower survived relatively unscathed, the casino barge was significantly damaged. Beau Rivage was one of the few still recognizable buildings remaining on Biloxi's coast.\n\nIn the weeks following Hurricane Katrina and in the wake of the catastrophic damage to the coast's casinos in the hurricane, the Mississippi state legislature changed its laws regarding the placement of casinos. Instead of having to be on barges on the water, casinos may now be built on land as long as they are within of the shore.\n\nIn November 2006, the resort opened a new Tom Fazio-designed championship golf course named Fallen Oak.\n\nIn 2009 there were news reports that Beau Rivage's parent company MGM Mirage had hired investment firm Morgan Stanley to assist the company in finding possible buyers for the Biloxi property and its cousin the MGM Grand Detroit. The Beau Rivage and MGM Grand Detroit were considered to be MGM Mirage's top performing properties and if sold could fetch a total of $1–$2 billion which then would be used to lower MGM Mirage's debt load. In the event, no sale happened.\n\n"}

Historically, it is known for repelling the Turkish attack in 1552 during the Siege of Eger.\n\nThe first castle was built on the high hill named Várhegy at Felsőtárkány near Eger.\n\nDuring the Mongol invasion in 1241, this castle was ruined, and the bishop of Eger moved it to a rocky hill in the city of Eger. On the hill, a new castle was built, and it developed rapidly. In 1470 a Gothic palace was built. In 1552, a Turkish army of 35,000-40,000 soldiers attacked the castle which had 2,100-2,300 defenders. The siege failed as the Turks suffered heavy casualties. A total of 1,700 of the defenders survived. After that Turks besieged the castle again in 1596, resulting in a Turkish victory. In 1701, the Austrians exploded half of the castle (the \"Külső vár\").\n\nArchaeological excavations only started in 1925 and the castle was used by the army as barracks until 1957.\n\nThere are several museums in the castle:\nand several periodic exhibitions.\n\n"}
{"id": "2066697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066697", "title": "Heritage centre", "text": "Heritage centre\n\nA heritage centre, center, or museum is a public facility – typically a museum, monument, visitor centre, or park – that is primarily dedicated to the presentation of historical and cultural information about a place and its people, and often also including, to some degree, the area's natural history. Heritage centres typically differ from most traditional museums in featuring a high proportion of \"hands-on\" exhibits and live or lifelike specimens and practical artifacts.\n\nSome are open-air museums – heritage parks – devoted to depiction of daily life or occupational activity at a particular time and place, and may feature re-creations of typical buildings of an era. Such sites are often used for experimental archaeology, and as shooting locations for documentaries and historical-fiction films and television. A few are rebuilt archaeological sites, using the excavated foundations of original buildings, some restore historic structures that were not yet lost, while others are mock-ups built near actual sites of historic value (which may still be subject to ongoing excavation, study, and preservation). Many also have living museum features, such as costumed staff, demonstrations of and short courses in historical craft-working, dramatic presentations (live-action mock combat, etc.), and other living history activities. Others may be more narrowly focused on a particular occupation or industry, such as rail transport or the early factories or mines around which a community developed.\n\nThe distinction between a heritage centre or park, and a history-based theme park can become blurred, as at Nikko Edomura, focused on Feudal Japan, and Wild West City, a self-described \"heritage theme park\" about the American Old West.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066699", "title": "Castle of Diósgyőr", "text": "Castle of Diósgyőr\n\nThe Castle of Diósgyőr is a medieval castle in the historical town of Diósgyőr which is now part of the Northern Hungarian city Miskolc.\nThe first Castle of Diósgyőr was built probably in the 12th century and was destroyed during the Mongol invasion (1241–42). The current, Gothic castle was built after the invasion and reached the peak of its importance during the reign of King Louis the Great (1342-1382). Later it became a wedding gift for the queens of Hungary, which it remained until the Ottoman invasion of Hungary in the 16th century. By the end of the 17th century it was already in ruins. Archaeological excavations were made from the 1960s. In 2014 the castle was restored, the rooms are furnished with Mediaeval-style furniture.\n\nThe first castle was built in the 12th century, it is likely that it was an earthwork and timber castle and was destroyed during the Mongol invasion (1241–1242.) The castle that stands today was probably built by King Béla IV, who, after the Mongols left the country, ordered a castle to be built on every hilltop. In the earliest times the castle was an oval structure with a rounded donjon, surrounded by a polygonal outer wall. In 1316 it was mentioned as \"new castle\", which confirms the theory that it was built in place of a destroyed castle. Judging from a document listing the taxes paid by towns in 1330 it seems the town around the castle was one of the richest towns of the county.\n\nThe castle had its prime during the reign of Louis I (Louis the Great). Its importance lay in standing near the road leading to Poland (the mother of Louis the Great, Elizabeth Lokietkówna, was a Polish princess; Louis himself became King of Poland in 1370.) The king had the castle rebuilt and modernised. Surrounded by several walls, the inner castle was built around a rectangular courtyard, and it had four towers, one on each corner. On the first floor were the storerooms and on the second floor were the rooms and the Knights' Hall, which was 25 meters long and 13 meters wide. The modernising of the castle was finished under the reign of Louis' daughter Mary. The castle was surrounded by a 4 metre deep moat.\n\nIn 1364 the nearby town Miskolc was annexed to the Diósgyőr estate. In 1381 the Peace Treaty of Turin was signed in the Diósgyőr Castle. In the treaty the Italian town of Venice was compelled to raise the flag of the Anjou dynasty on the St. Mark square every Sunday. In the north-eastern tower of the castle there is a waxworks exhibition showing the wax figures of King Louis and the Venetian envoy.\n\nDiósgyőr lost some of its importance when the personal union between Hungary and Poland ended (Louis shared the two countries between his two daughters Mary and Jadwiga.) For the next few centuries the castle was a holiday residence for queens. The last queen owning the castle was Maria, wife of Louis II. She gave up the castle formally in 1546 (by this time it had been occupied by the ruling prince of Transylvania.)\n\nWhen the Ottoman army began to occupy the southern territories of Hungary, the castle was fortified. Its owners, the Gyarmati Balassa family turned it into a large fortress, and they had an Italian-style rondelle built to the north-western tower. The slim turrets were replaced by strong bastions. This was the last time the castle was rebuilt; after 1564 the owners changed frequently, and the castle slowly deteriorated. In 1596 the Ottoman army occupied the Eger Castle and defeated the Christian army at Mezőkeresztes. The Diósgyőr Castle fell too; it was built to be a holiday residence and was never intended to be a large fortress that withstands the siege of a foreign army. From this time Diósgyőr was under Ottoman occupation and the area was ruled by the Pasha of Eger until 1687 when this part of the country was freed from Turkish rule. By this time the castle lost all of its military importance.\n\nThe restoration of the castle began in 1953. Originally only the parts threatened with collapsing were restored, the archaeological excavation began only in 1960.\n\nBefore 2014 there was an exhibition of the history of the castle and the Pauline monastery, a weapons exhibition and the waxworks showing the signing of the Torino Peace Treaty in the northeastern tower (which belonged to the King's quarters). The north-western tower functions as a looking-tower, with a view on Diósgyőr and the surrounding hills; on the ground floor there is a small mint where tourists can make commemorative coins with their own hands. The south-western tower is in ruins. One of the main tourist attractions of the castle is a large waxworks exhibition in the outer castle. This exhibition is one of the largest waxworks exhibitions of Central Europe and it shows six scenes of everyday life in medieval Diósgyőr.\n\nThe Castle Plays are held twice in every year (May and August). Tournaments and open air plays are held at the castle, and there is a medieval fair next to the castle. An important musical event, the Kaláka Folk Festival is held on the second weekend of July each year.\n\nUnlike the castles of Eger and Kőszeg, the Diósgyőr Castle is surrounded by modern concrete buildings instead of a historical town, but it is still a popular tourist destination, thanks to the castle plays, the museum, the waxworks exhibitions and \"Mrs. Déry's House\", a small museum dedicated to the popular 19th-century actress Róza Széppataki Déry, in the house where she lived.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066719", "title": "Kendrys Morales", "text": "Kendrys Morales\n\nKendrys Morales Rodríguez (born June 20, 1983) is a Cuban-Dominican former professional baseball designated hitter and first baseman who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Seattle Mariners, Minnesota Twins, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, Oakland Athletics, and the New York Yankees.\n\nMorales suffered an ankle injury on May 29, 2010, during a celebration of his walk-off grand slam, which kept him out of Major League Baseball for nearly two years. In April 2012, Morales returned to the Angels' line-up for the season opener against the Kansas City Royals. Morales has also played first base and right field during his MLB career.\n\nMorales played in Cuba's equivalent of the North American Triple-A level. With 16- to 17-year-olds in the category, he was the first starter of the pitching staff, and fourth in the batting order, and had the ability to hit home runs from both sides of the plate.\n\nMorales joined the Cuban national baseball team in 2002 and immediately became a star player—despite being the first teenager to make the team in nearly 20 years. He was the cleanup hitter on the team during its dramatic 2003 World Cup championship. His grand slam in the final round against Taiwan secured a 6–3 Cuban victory, one game after hitting a home run that provided the winning runs against Brazil.\n\nIn his first—of two and a half—full season with Havana's Industriales of the Cuban National Series, in 2002, Morales had a batting average of .324 with 21 home runs and 82 RBI, and pitched in a game during the regular season, setting seven rookie records in the process (including HR and RBI); and obviously becoming Rookie of the Year, being considered the best rookie in the history of Cuban baseball. In his second season, he suffered an injury and did not hit as many home runs as in his rookie season, but he finished with a .391 batting average.\n\nMorales' stardom in Cuba was short-lived, however. He was sent back to Cuba from Panama during the Olympic qualifying round in November 2003 for making contact with an agent. It was the last time he would suit up as a Cuban.\n\nBy early 2004, Cuba's national team and the Industriales banned Morales from their teams for disciplinary reasons due to their belief that he had met with people in an attempt to flee the nation. Morales denies this accusation, telling a reporter \"That's not true. I never talked to any agent. But from that moment on, I just wanted to leave. I tried to do it several times without success, occasionally ending up in jail.\" He escaped on a raft in June 2004 to the shores of southern Florida, his eighth attempt at escape.\n\nBut, as is the usual practice of defectors, he chose to leave the country to establish foreign residency so as to avoid the MLB draft. He left once again, this time to the Dominican Republic, where he was privately scouted by several Major League teams. Preston Gómez, in his role as consultant to Angels general manager Bill Stoneman, ended up signing him to a six-year deal worth $3 million dollars up front in December 2004. Morales played winter ball for the Estrellas Orientales Dominican team to keep himself in game shape.\n\nBy the spring of 2005, the Angels hoped to have Morales practice in the Cactus League to get ready for a quick ascension through their farm system or possibly even make the team as the designated hitter. Because he was not yet a citizen, the Dominican government held up granting Morales the necessary passport to fly back to the U.S. for several months. He was not able to get all his paperwork in order until late May and he finally made his minor league debut on May 21 for the Single-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. After three weeks (his batting average was .344, with five home runs), he was moved up to Double-A Arkansas, where he was second on the team in home runs despite playing there for only half the season. When that season ended, he was chosen by the Angels to play for the Surprise Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League.\n\nMorales had a strong spring training in 2006 for the Angels, but failed to make the 25-man roster.\n\nHe ultimately made his Major League debut on May 23, 2006, playing first base and going 3-for-5, including a home run in his second at bat, versus the Texas Rangers. Thereafter he performed well enough to be the Angels' regular first baseman until his eventual demotion back to Triple-A on July 23, 2006.\n\nMorales enjoyed a breakout year in his first full season. He hit 34 home runs and slugged .569, ranking second in the AL, behind eventual AL MVP Joe Mauer.\n\nMorales was promoted to starting first baseman after Mark Teixeira (the Angels' first baseman for the 2008 season) left the Angels as a free agent in the winter of 2008. Morales said of the timing of his promotion, \"The guys that played ahead of me were seasoned players, and I didn't deserve to play in the big leagues yet. The one thing I thought about -- not how long I had to wait -- was just to concentrate on playing well once that opportunity came.\"\n\nHe hit well in the first half, and hit extremely well in the second half of 2009, and was named AL Player of the Month in August when he drove in 33 runs in 28 games with 10 homers, batting .385 and slugging .734. His performance led to talk of him being a possible American League MVP, eventually placing 5th in MVP voting behind Mauer, Teixeira, Derek Jeter, and Miguel Cabrera.\n\nMorales hit a walk-off grand slam off Brandon League to end a 10-inning 5–1 victory over the Seattle Mariners at Angel Stadium of Anaheim on May 29, 2010. Approaching his celebrating teammates, he jumped up with the intention of stomping on home plate instead of simply stepping on it. His awkward landing resulted in a fracture in his lower left leg, placing him immediately on the disabled list. The injury required surgery, and he missed the rest of the 2010 season. In 51 games in the 2010 season, Morales hit .290 with 11 home runs and 39 RBIs.\n\nOn May 11, 2011, it was announced that Morales, still sidelined by his injured ankle from 2010, would miss the whole 2011 season due to complications in his rehabilitation from surgery on the ankle.\n\nOn March 22, 2012, nearly two years after his ankle injury, Morales returned to the lineup in a spring training game against the Kansas City Royals. On April 16, he hit his first home run since his 2010 injury.\n\nOn July 30, 2012, Morales hit two home runs in the same inning (once left handed and the other right handed). He became only the third player in MLB history to homer both left and right in the same inning. He finished the 2012 season with a .273 batting average, 22 home runs, and 73 RBI.\n\nOn December 19, 2012, the Angels traded Morales to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Jason Vargas.\n\nOn June 23, 2013, Morales hit a first-pitch three run home run in the 10th inning against the Oakland Athletics after subbing for Brendan Ryan, leading to a 6-3 Mariners win at Safeco Field. After rounding the bases, he gently stepped on home plate. On July 2, 2013, he hit two home runs and had 6 RBIs in a 9-2 win over the division-leading Texas Rangers. On August 26, 2013, Morales was claimed off waivers by an unknown team; however, he was not traded within 48 hours of the waiver claim, meaning the Mariners pulled him back from waivers.\n\nOn September 4, Morales hit a walk-off two-run homer off the Kansas City Royals to win the game 6-4 in the ninth inning. It was the only game the Mariners won during the four-game series.\n\nThe Mariners made Morales a qualifying offer after the 2013 season, which he rejected. He remained unsigned as of Opening Day. On June 8, 2014, Morales agreed to terms with the Minnesota Twins on a one-year contract and a prorated portion of $12 million, worth approximately $7.4 million.\n\nOn July 24, 2014, Morales was traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for pitcher Stephen Pryor.\n\nIn December 2014, Morales signed a two-year, $17 million contract with the Kansas City Royals.\n\nMorales finished the 2015 season with 106 RBIs, his highest since his 2009 season with the Angels.\n\nOn September 20, 2015, Morales hit three home runs (which tied a Royals record), and had 15 total bases (which set a Royals record) in a 10-3 Royals win over the Detroit Tigers. Morales only had 3 RBI and had nobody on base all 5 times he came up to bat. He went 4-4 with 3 homers, a triple, and a walk. On October 14, in the winner-take-all game 5 of the American League Divisional Series against the Houston Astros, Morales hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning to secure a 7-2 Royals win.\n\nHitting .295 with 22 home runs, 106 RBIs, and 39 doubles, while seeing the lowest percentage of fastballs of all MLB hitters (47.8%), Morales was named the recipient of the 2015 Edgar Martínez Award, an honor presented annually to the most outstanding designated hitter in the American League.\n\nAfter coming of his great 2015 campaign, Morales struggled at the start of 2016. Before June, he had a .193 average; after getting a 4-game break to regather himself mentally, Morales finished June with a .262 average and was the Royals' home run leader on the season. On November 4, Morales declined his option with the Royals and became a free agent.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, Morales agreed to a three-year, $33 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. The contract became official on November 18. On August 31, 2017, Morales became the first player in Blue Jays franchise history to have 4 hits, 3 home runs, and 7 RBIs in the same game when he did so in an 11–8 win against the Baltimore Orioles. Morales made his major league debut as a pitcher on May 20, 2018, and pitched a hitless ninth inning for the Blue Jays in a 9–2 loss to the Oakland Athletics. On July 8, 2018, Morales hit his 200th career home run off Domingo Germán of the New York Yankees. Starting on August 19, Morales hit a home run and continued a seven-game home run hit streak ending on August 26 to record the longest such streak in Blue Jays franchise history, and became the seventh person in MLB history to accomplish the feat. His accomplishments during the week of August 20–26 earned him the AL Player of the Week award.\n\nOn March 27, 2019, the Blue Jays traded Morales and cash considerations to the Oakland Athletics for minor league infielder Jesus Lopez and international bonus money. On May 13, he was designated for assignment.\n\nOn May 14, 2019, the Athletics traded Morales to the New York Yankees for cash considerations or a player to be named later.\nOn June 25, 2019, the Yankees designated Morales for assignment. Morales was released on July 2.\n\nMorales announced his retirement from baseball on February 7, 2020 after 13 MLB seasons.\n\nMorales and his wife, Yarley, have three children: Hanely, Kendrys Jr. and Andrea. Until March 2011, MLB mistakenly spelled Morales' first name \"Kendry.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066722", "title": "Heart to Yours", "text": "Heart to Yours\n\nHeart to Yours is the debut solo studio album by American singer and songwriter Michelle Williams. Released on April 16, 2002 by Sanctuary and Columbia Records, it became the first solo release of any Destiny's Child member. Production of the album began in 2001, with Williams working with an array of producers, including her brother Erron Williams (who produced the title track), HR Crump and Warryn Campbell. \"Heart to Yours\" is primarily an R&B album, however it heavily incorporates elements of many other styles and genres such as neo-soul, inspirational, urban contemporary gospel and even rock music. The album's lyrical content and subject matter is also diverse and ranges from songs that glorify and praise God to tributes dedicated to the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, which encourage those suffering in the aftermath of the attacks that the \"sun will shine again\".\n\nReceiving generally positive reviews from critics, \"Heart to Yours\" peaked at number one on the US \"Billboard\" Gospel Albums chart after debuting with 17,000 copies sold in one week; eventually becoming 2002's biggest selling album of that genre in the US, selling over 200,000 copies. The album was also a success on another \"Billboard\" component chart, the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it peaked within the top 20 at number seventeen. However, the album failed to make as big of an impact on the US \"Billboard\" 200 as the debuts of Williams' bandmates, peaking at a moderate fifty-seven. The album won Williams an award for \"Best Gospel Act\" at the 2002 MOBO Awards and its lead single \"Heard a Word\" was featured on the platinum-certified \"WOW Gospel 2003\" compilation album. \"Billboard\" listed Williams as the fifth Top Gospel Artist of 2002.\n\nWilliams began her singing career as a backing vocalist for R&B singer Monica in 1999 before joining Destiny's Child with Farrah Franklin alongside original members Beyoncé Knowles and Kelly Rowland, replacing former members LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson to much controversy in 2000. In late 2000, while recording their third album, \"Survivor\", Destiny's Child revealed that they would produce solo albums to be released \"simultaneously\" in the \"hope\" that they would \"boost interest in Destiny's Child\". Describing the stylistic differences of the albums' directions, Knowles said \"We're going to all do different types of music and support each other's album\" before saying \"hopefully it will broaden our audience, so it will help us all out\". The idea of individual releases emanated from the group's manager and Knowles' father, Mathew. After the release of \"Survivor\", the group announced in late 2001 a temporary break-up to focus on solo projects, including working on their own albums. Before undertaking their respective solo projects, the group released a Christmas album, \"8 Days of Christmas\".\n\nWilliams worked in the studio with several musical collaborators, including Scott “Shavoni” Parker, Damon Elliott, Warren Campbell and gospel producer HR Crump. Williams also co-wrote five of the songs whilst her brother Erron Williams, produced numerous tracks. She revealed in an interview with Gospel Flava that she \"received tremendous support\" from Music World, saying, \"they came to me. There wasn't a question as to what type of music I was going to do. Music World has a Gospel division and I'm the first artist to come out on Music World and in the Gospel division. I'd love to do more and more Gospel projects\". She also discussed her Christian upbringing, saying, \"I grew up in Rockford, Illinois. St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church\". Furthermore, she explained, \"I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school.\" In discussing the musical transition she said, \"it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. I thought that it would be a perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that. They go Gospel when they don't have anything else to do anymore, you know? I chose to do this while I can reach people.\" She echoed this sentiment in speaking with \"Billboard\" about the album and its artistic direction, saying: \"Some people will do gospel when their career fails, but I chose to do it at the height of the popularity of Destiny's Child. I didn't want to do it because it was a fad. I wanted to do it because it's in me. It's in my heart.\"\n\nGenerally, the album consists of urban contemporary gospel music containing elements of R&B, neo-soul and traditional black gospel music, with inspirational lyrics about building, maintaining and appreciating a relationship with God which also encourage the listener that \"everything is going to work out fine\". The album's lead single, \"Heard a Word\", sums up the theme of the album, with its chorus: \"I heard a word / Saying girl, you'll be fine / I heard a word that would ease my troubled mind / Took all the hurt away / Warmed me up inside like a summer day / So glad that you'd never break your promises\". Other songs are tributes to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States; \"Better Place\", written by Michelle Williams, Damon Elliott and Kayla Parker, is one such example which was inspired by the catastrophic event and is an emotional tribute to those who died in the attack.\n\nThe album features guest vocals by various artists, including Williams' Destiny's Child band mates – Kelly Rowland and Beyoncé Knowles – on \"Gospel Medley\" (originally produced for the group's 2001 album, \"Survivor\") which consists of an interpolation of Kirk Franklin's \"Holy is the Lamb\", the popular Anna B. Warner hymn \"Jesus Loves Me\" and concludes with the famous final section of Richard Smallwood's \"Total Praise\". Other guests include Carl Thomas on a remixed version of the BeBe & CeCe Winans classic, \"Heaven\", (featured as a bonus track on the album); Men of Standard's Isaac Carree and Lowell C. Pye on \"You Care for Me\"; Mary Mary on \"So Glad\"; and Shirley Caesar on \"Steal Away to Jesus\", which was heralded by most critics as \"the album's high point\" and was first included on Caesar's 2001 album, \"Hymns\".\n\nIn discussing the collaborations, Williams said it was \"no problem\" to connect with the featured artists on the album, saying \"a phone call was made and we were already cool with one another. It kinda wasn't even a business thing. It was like 'that's my girl', you know, and I personally asked them myself. So that's how that went.\" She also revealed she was \"initially uncertain about boldly referencing Jesus on the project\". Whilst discussing the lyrical content she stated, \"at first I was like, 'should I say Jesus', but before I knew it, I couldn't help but to [say His name] [...] I wasn't going to let anybody stop me from doing that...not that anybody really was, you know?\".\n\n\"Heart to Yours\" received generally positive reviews from critics. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic complimented the non-hasty production of the album, noting that \"there are different producers on nearly every track, and the arrangements for the most part are state-of-the-art urban contemporary efforts\". Ruhlmann also described Williams' voice as \"warm\" and \"kittenish\" before writing that \"by the time Williams is trading lines with Isaac Carree and Lowell Pye of Men of Standard\" she \"has transformed herself from kitten to tiger, belting out the words with absolute conviction\". \"GospelCity.com\" also praised \"Michelle's delicate vocals\" – particularly on \"You Care For Me\" where Williams' \"soulful chops\" are said to \"shine through brilliantly\" – and noted that on \"Heard A Word\", Williams \"demonstrates further versatility in Ella-like fashion\", concluding the review by describing \"Heart to Yours\" as a \"melodically pleasant, lyrically sound gospel project\".\n\nSal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" also described Williams' voice was \"warm\", noting that it recalls \"the playful wisps of her R&B contemporaries (Jill Scott, Erykah Badu) and the breathy timbre of Diana Ross\". Cinquemani then described the album as being \"a mix of slick hip-hop-style beats, inspirational themes and catchy, pop-friendly hooks\" with \"admirable\", \"largely restrained arrangements\", lending particular praise to the \"surprisingly eloquent (and non-denominational) sentiment\" that is featured within the lyrics of the album's title track (\"Heart to Yours\"). Tracy Hopkins of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine gave the least favorable review however, stating that despite Williams' collaborations with contemporary gospel singers, they \"only reinforce the thin-piped vocalist's shortcomings\". Hopkins also wrote that although Williams \"is in the right place\", her vocals are \"too quiet\" and the production is too \"tame to start a real Holy Ghost party\". On the contrary, Mike Rimmer of \"Cross Rhythms\" gave a very favorable review of the album (10/10), describing \"the quality\" as being \"superb throughout\" and \"Michelle's soulful laid back vocals\" as being \"delicious throughout\".\n\nWhile her musical cohorts were finishing their projects, Williams' management strategically planned a successive release of their albums to avoid \"rivalry\" on the charts. Over a period of one year, Williams released \"Heart to Yours\" on April 16, 2002, in the United States, ahead of Kelly Rowland's 2002 album, \"Simply Deep\" and Beyoncé Knowles' 2003 \"Dangerously in Love\" – all debut releases. Williams expressed that she wanted \"to reach everyone\" and hoped \"that a small percentage of Destiny's Child's fanbase\" would \"get it and be reached\" and \"hear a different message.\n\nAlthough \"Heart to Yours\" failed to dominate the US \"Billboard\" 200, it gained success on \"Billboard\"'s components charts. The album entered the \"Billboard\" Top Gospel Albums chart at number one with first week sales of 17,000 copies. Eventually spending a total of forty-six weeks on the chart, \"Heart to Yours\" became the best-selling gospel album of the year. On the main album chart in the US, the \"Billboard\" 200, the album reached number fifty-seven on May 4, 2002, spending fourteen weeks on the chart and also managed to peak within the top 20 of the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, at number seventeen, where the album spent twenty-four weeks. According to \"The New York Times\", \"Heart to Yours\" has sold 203,000 copies in the US. In addition to this, the album was listed at number six on the US \"Billboard\" Year-End Top Gospel Albums chart in 2002, making it one of the most successful gospel releases of the year.\n\n\nCredits are taken from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1974 the college went bankrupt due to poor fiscal management and the loss of anticipated donor funds. A core of determined faculty and students refused to see the college fold, and after a series of emergency meetings, formed the Prescott Center for Alternative Education. This earned the school national publicity as \"The College That Wouldn't Die.\"\n\nDuring the spring semester of 1975, classes were held in the basement of the historic Hassayampa Hotel in downtown Prescott, Arizona, as well as in the homes of both faculty and students. Over the succeeding years, the college was able to regain the legal right to the name Prescott College and acquire property and buildings for its main campus. Prescott College has an agroecology program at Jenner Farm, an international center in Kino Bay, Mexico, programs in regenerative design in partnership with the Ecosa Institute, the Prescott College Art Gallery at Sam Hill Warehouse and the college also has a Tucson, Arizona location.\n\nMost of the Prescott location buildings are repurposed buildings, converted to classrooms from stores and offices. The Village residence hall has a townhouse style housing groups of 7-8 students with shared common areas. The Crossroads Center is built from reclaimed timber, Corten steel, compressed earth with solar panels and rooftop gardens. It houses the Crossroads Cafe, classrooms, meeting facilities, the Fanon Center, the college library as well as computer labs. \n\nThere are four general degree programs at Prescott College: the Resident Undergraduate Program (RU), Limited-Residency Undergraduate Program (LRU), the Resident Masters and Limited-Residency Masters Program (RM/LRM), and a Limited-Residency Ph.D. program (PhD) in Sustainability Education.\n\nWithin the resident undergraduate program, students can earn a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies, or a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, Visual Arts or Interdisciplinary Arts & Letters.\n\nResident students live in Prescott and attend classes at the main campus. Students enrolled in the Limited-Residency program work with community based mentors and Prescott College faculty. \n\nPrescott College was an early adopter of Prior Learning Assessment and in 2014 was certified as a Veteran Supportive Campus by the Arizona Department of Veterans Services. The college was the first private college in Arizona to receive such a designation. The college uses the system of narrative evaluation in addition to or as a substitute for the conventional grading system of A-F letter grades.\n\nResident undergraduate students begin with a three-week orientation in Arizona's wilderness, known as wilderness orientation. In their first week, students are introduced to the college and gather supplies before being sent out in groups of 7-14 people, depending on the size of the incoming class. The average distance covered varies from 50–100 miles. There are also options for a community-based orientation where students explore and are educated about their surrounding environment.\n\nStudents may also choose the limited residency program which allows one to attend a colloquium (or series of such) on campus once a year, work with a primary faculty adviser and a mentor(s) who is usually based in the student's home community. This allows for the student to study from home in a community based setting. Programs are offered for the bachelor's degree, the master's degree and even a Ph.D using this limited residency model.\n\nStudents design a degree plan by the beginning of their junior year. Prescott College students fulfill basic requirements (such as math and writing) and then design their Competence (like a major) and Breadth (like a minor). The degree plan is submitted to the student's Individual Graduation Committee (IGC) for review. The IGC consists of at least one faculty member, and another faculty member and a student if desired. The committee will then edit and suggest classes that are needed to enhance and complete the Competence and Breadth.\n\nA student's course of study will fall under one of the following: Adventure Education (AE), Arts and Humanities (AH), Education (EDU), Environmental Studies and Sustainability (ESS), Psychology and Counseling (PSC) or Cultural and Regional Studies (CRS).\n\nSome examples of student degree plans would be: \"Environmental Studies with a competence in Ecology and a breadth in Chemistry\" or \"Global Studies with a competence in Latin American Cultures and a breadth in Psychology\".\n\nTo graduate from the college, each student must design and complete a senior project. Some examples include: The creation of Butte Creek Restoration Council, HUB (helping understand bicycles), The Ripple Repeat Project (campus thrift store), The Latin American Studies Scholarship Endowment Fund, The Freedom of Education Fund, an internship relevant to a student's Competence, or a research paper. A student must rigorously justify the project as proof of competence in their field of study.\nPrescott College is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the Association for Experiential Education.\n\nThe college's Teacher Education Program is approved by the Arizona State Board of Education and the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC). \n\nPrescott College has stand-alone student exchange relationships with Telemark University College in Norway, the Ecosa Institute in Prescott, the SOS Conservation Project, and Sail Caribbean, that permit students to study as visitors at other institutions while maintaining enrollment and paying tuition to Prescott.\n\nPrescott College is a member of the Eco League, a five-college consortium of colleges with environmental studies programs: Alaska Pacific University, Green Mountain College (now closed), Northland College, and College of the Atlantic and, since January 2014, Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.[1] The consortium is unique in that each college is in a different geographic area.\n\nPrescott College is also a member of Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a public interest, not-for-profit environmental law firm founded in 1989 in the USA to strengthen international and comparative environmental law and policy around the world.\n\nIn fall 2012, the college completed a $7.4M on-campus sustainable housing project, the Village, to accommodate up to 104 first-year students. The Village is a LEED Platinum certified facility that consists of 13 new multi-story townhome style apartment units, for up to eight students in each three-level unit. Most other students reside in nearby apartments, condos, and houses. \n\nFrom 2013 - 2016 Prescott College rented out one of its Village buildings to Embry-Riddle University.\n\nIn 2016 a student-led initiative resulted in the acquisition of the Frantz Fanon Community Strategy Center for use for student and community organizing and club meetings.\nGroups that currently meet in the Frantz Fanon Community Strategy Center include the Queer Student Union, The Advocates for Responsible Sexual Culture, the Black Student Union, Mi Familia (a Latino and indigenous group), Yavapai County Planned Parenthood, and others. These clubs have successfully organized many events and demonstrations at Prescott College, and in the community. The Frantz Fanon Community Strategy Center also includes a zine library, a food pantry, a kitchen, and multiple classroom spaces. \n\nPrescott College Activists were also able to successfully institute a $30 semester fee to support the Freedom Education Fund scholarship for undocumented immigrants seeking to attend university. Prescott College President John Flicker has said of this project “I am proud that our students take on the role of scholar activists”. \n\nThe College also has a Student Activity Center (SAC) which is used by a variety of individual students and clubs to hold meetings and interact. The space is also utilized for the Student Union Board (SUB meetings and includes a lounge area, kitchen area and the Max and Bessie Bakal Memorial Lounge and Library. \n\nPrescott College has a mountain biking team registered with USA Cycling that offers scholarships. Most athletics are intramural in general, since the college curriculum is centered on field-based immersion courses.\n\n\n"}

It was released by the Sanctuary Records Group and Columbia Records on January 26, 2004 in the United States. \"Do You Know\" \"straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B\" and is described as portraying \"a more intimate side of Michelle\". It contains a greater percentage of mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs. However, \"Do You Know\" is much more diverse, lyrically, than its predecessor \"Heart to Yours\", covering the themes of \"spiritual\" and \"carnal\" love and contains retrospective songs about Williams' career thus far, whilst still retaining the inspirational and encouraging lyrics that characterised \"Heart to Yours\".\n\nIn the US, \"Do You Know\" found fair success on \"Billboard's\" component charts; peaking at number two on the Gospel Albums chart, number three on the Christian Albums chart and number twenty-eight on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. However, the album peaked at one-hundred-and-twenty on the \"Billboard\" 200, making it Williams' lowest-charting album. Though the album was well received by critics, it sold only 10,000 copies in its first week of release. Despite this, the album was later re-released, including two new tracks and has now sold over 78,000 copies in the US alone as of 2008. The album gained Williams a nomination for \"Best Gospel Act\" at the 2004 MOBO Awards.\n\n After becoming the first member of Destiny's Child to release a solo album in 2002, Williams did not wait long to start work on its follow-up in 2003. Due to the success of \"Heart to Yours\", which topped the US Top Gospel Albums and became the best-selling gospel album of 2002, anticipation was high for Williams' second album. Before taking over the lead role in the Broadway musical \"Aida\" on November 18, 2003, Williams began working on the album, involving an even greater variety of producers than she did for her debut album such as trio PAJAM, made up of Paul Allen, J. Moss and Walter Kearney, duo Dawkins & Dawkins, Tommy Sims, bandmate Beyoncé Knowles, her sister Solange Knowles, and Williams' brother Erron Williams. As with her debut, Williams contributed greatly to the songwriting of the album, co-writing a total of six tracks on the album.\n\nPrior to \"Unexcpected\"s release, Williams told MTV that she couldn't \"wait for the world to hear [her] new solo album\", describing it as \"fresher\", \"more inspirational\", and \"more on the secular side\". Furthermore, she stated \"whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it\", therefore expecting \"some of her gospel fans to be a little upset\" but wanted to \"keep it real\". She also discussed one of the album's primary themes – \"what it's like to be in love\" – explaining \"[I talk about] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life\" after saying \"I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them.\" In describing the album during another interview, this time for \"GospelCity\", Williams said \"these songs are just about the real me\" and that she \"just wrote from [her] heart\" before acknowledging that \"it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked\", but \"the stuff\" that's on the album \"is stuff [she] went through\". Williams then said \"this whole album is about God's love and me\". After being asked \"Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?\", Williams responded \"That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know what I went through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life.\"\n\nCritical reviews of the album were generally favorable. Kwaku of \"Cross Rhythms\" wrote that \"Michelle seems happy to produce music which straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B\" and thus \"she certainly isn’t going to have problems facing the congregation when she attends church\". Sony of \"Gospel City\" described the album as a \"beautifully written [...] very wonderfully produced gospel album that in some places is a throwback to a Duke Ellington jazz minuet, in others it's a fast paced hip-hop laced gospel after-party, and in others it's a beautiful testimony of a woman at the well\" He then went on to comment that \"the true highlight of this album is Michelle's unique, yet beautiful, timbre and her magnificent song writing.\" Caroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" however gave a more mixed review, commenting that \"Do You Know?\" \"doesn't provide the running start\" that Williams \"needs\". She then noted that \"Williams's strength is a shimmery jazz lilt. \n\nEmily Sogn of \"PopMatters\" likened Williams' \"pleasingly slow paced\" singing style to pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson and described the album as \"a decent, yet not spectacular sophomore effort\", noting that \"while it might not enough to ensure her a successful career outside of her contributions to Destiny's Child, it isn’t without its particular merits and shining moments\". \"People\" magazine commented that \"there is a contemporary R&B sound\" to the album \"that wouldn't be out of place on secular radio\" and noted that \"The Movement\" \"has a hip-hop vibe, while glossy ballads like \"The Way of Love\" sound like they could be Destiny's Child slow jams\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" editor Chris Willman rated the album B- and highlighted the artistic growth on the album. Comparing it to its predecessor he wrote \"this second solo foray into contemporary spirituals vastly improves upon her godforsaken 2002 debut\" and that \"both the beats and girlish chops feel more seasoned, even if she'll always be more R&B minimalist than the gospel powerhouse she aspires to be\". AllMusic wrote that \"working with a wide array of producers [...] Williams is subtly more up-tempo than on her debut.\" The staff found that the songs \"all point to an artist with a considerable amount of self-assurance. Not surprisingly, Williams is never far from the roots that extend back to her day job in Destiny's Child.\"\n\nFirst released on January 26, 2004, \"Do You Know\" preceded the release of Destiny's Child's fourth and final regular studio album \"Destiny Fulfilled\", making Williams the only member of the group to release more than one solo album in the group's hiatus. Williams promoted the album during various TV appearances and live performances, some of the most notable include; live performances of \"Do You Know\" (the album's first single) and \"Purpose In Your Storm\" on various \"TBN\" programs and a live performance of a newly arranged version of \"The Way of Love\" on \"Regis & Kelly\". Notably, Williams also performed \"Do You Know\" live on the 2004 Soul Train Music Awards and throughout the \"Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It\" world concert tour – which visited 16 countries throughout Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America with 67 dates in total. A video and audio recording of one such performance of \"Do You Know\", recorded in Atlanta was included on the \"\" 2006 DVD release, which has since been re-issued on Blu-ray. \"Do You Know\" was also promoted with the filming and release of a music video for the song.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Do You Know\" achieved its greatest commercial success on \"Billboard's\" component charts. Almost topping the Gospel Albums chart, the album peaked at number two, where it had its longest chart run, staying on the chart for 20 weeks, resulting in its placement at number twenty-five on \"Billboards Year-End Gospel Albums chart. Meanwhile, the album peaked at number three on \"Billboards Christian Albums chart, remaining on the chart for six weeks and peaked at number twenty-eight on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it spent a total of five weeks. However, \"Do You Know\" only managed to hold one week on the main US albums chart – the \"Billboard\" 200 – where it peaked at number one-hundred-and-twenty. According to Billboard.com, as of 2008, the album has sold 78,000 copies.\n\n\nCredits are taken from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

France and Japan have enjoyed a very robust and progressive relationship spanning centuries through various contacts in each other's countries by senior representatives, strategic efforts, and cultural exchanges.\n\nAfter nearly two centuries of seclusion by \"Sakoku\" in Japan, the two countries became very important partners from the second half of the 19th century in the military, economic, legal and artistic fields. The Tokugawa shogunate (\"Bakufu\") modernized its army through the assistance of French military missions (Jules Brunet), and Japan later relied on France for several aspects of its modernization, particularly the development of a shipbuilding industry during the early years of the Imperial Japanese Navy (Léonce Verny , Émile Bertin), and the development of a Legal code.\n\nFrance derived part of its modern artistic inspiration from Japanese art, essentially through Japonism and its influence on Impressionism, and almost completely relied on Japan for its prosperous silk industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 1996, in Lyon, as part of the G7 summit which took place thanks to the crucial role played by the Consul General of Japan, Louis Michallet, Ryutaro Hashimoto and Jacques Chirac decided to organize \"The Year of Japan in France\", from April 1997 to March 1998 in order to correct the superficial and sometimes inaccurate understanding of Japanese culture. The start of that year coincided with the inauguration of the House of Culture of Japan in Paris. \"The Year of France in Japan\" followed \"the Year of Japan\", the combination of these two events inaugurating Franco-Japanese relations for the 21st century.\n\nThe two countries have been collaborating closely in the area of nuclear energy generation. In September 2013, two years after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima, Japan has officially accepted help from France for the decommission and dismantle of Fukushima's reactors. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, a Japanese corporation and France's Areva began cooperating on constructing a nuclear reactor in Turkey in 2013.\n\nIn June 2005, France and Japan announced a collaboration to build the next generation supersonic commercial aircraft, a successor to the Concorde. Commercial service is not expected until 2050.\n\nLaurent Fabius, French Foreign Minister, met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as a courtesy call during a visit to Japan from 5 October to 6 October 2014. The meeting included Abe expressing his condolences for the ISIL beheading of French backpacker Hervé Gourdel and both agreed on future meetings on defense cooperation and tackling global warming.\n\nOn December 8th, 2014, during public ceremonies under the aegis and presence of authorities Japan recognised the Niten Ichi Ryu Memorial which recalls history and Japan-France link.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2066774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066774", "title": "Aggregating anemone", "text": "Aggregating anemone\n\nThe aggregating anemone (\"Anthopleura elegantissima\"), or clonal anemone, is the most abundant species of sea anemone found on rocky, tide swept shores along the Pacific coast of North America. This cnidarian hosts endosymbiotic algae called zooxanthellae that contribute substantially to primary productivity in the intertidal zone. The aggregating anemone has become a model organism for the study of temperate cnidarian-algal symbioses.\n\nThe polyps of the aggregating anemone reach up to eight cm across the oral disk with approximately 100 tentacles in three or four rows around the margins of the oral disk. Most are olive to bright green (depending on the species of algal symbionts present) with tentacles tipped in pink. Individuals that live in microhabitats that are deficient in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), such as under docks or in caves, lack symbionts and are pale yellow to white in color.\n\nPacific coast of North America from Alaska, United States to Baja California, Mexico.\n\nThis species of anemone is capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually. As adults, aggregating anemones release gametes into the water that join to form genetically unique individuals that settle on intertidal rock. This genetically distinct individual can then proliferate through binary fission. Some argue that this is not true reproduction but actually a form of growth. Fission is often prompted in the autumn by a decrease in the abundance of food and follows sexual spawning in summer. Over time, a single individual can generate a large colony of genetically identical polyps. Because of its ability to grow in this manner, the genetic entity of a colony is potentially immortal on an ecological time scale.\n\nAggregating anemones host endosymbiotic, photosynthetic algae in their tentacles, oral disk and column of the polyps. In addition to a chlorophyte, two species of dinoflagellate \"Symbiodinium\", \"S. muscatinei\" and \"S. californium\" are known to inhabit the anemone. These algae are generally referred to as zooxanthellae (dinoflagellates) and zoochlorellae (chlorophytes) and many polyps concurrently host more than one type of alga within their tissues. The rate of occurrence of each alga is determined by temperature and light regimes of anemone habitats. Zoochlorellae are typically found at higher latitudes and in deeper intertidal habitats than zooxanthellae. Of the two species of zooxanthellae that inhabit the anemone, \"S. californium\" is restricted to southern California due to its intolerance of cold temperatures whereas \"S. muscatinei\" is tolerant of a broad range of temperature and irradiance levels.\n\nThe mutualistic relationship of these organisms requires adaptations of each partner. The algal symbionts convert inorganic carbon into carbohydrates for use by each partner and release oxygen to the animal host in the process. To accommodate the algae, the anemone must provide concentrated carbon dioxide to their intracellular photosynthetic guests as well as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to fuel the photosynthetic process. This restricts the symbiotic organism to euphotic habitats and requires consistent exposure to high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). To protect from potentially damaging UVR, the algae provide mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) that act as sunscreen for themselves and the host. The anemones, in turn, produce antioxidants called superoxide dismutases to protect against reactive oxygen that causes oxidative stress.\n\nThe aggregating anemone is agonistic toward other individuals with different genetic disposition. When one colony of genetically identical polyps encounters a different genetic colony, the two will wage territorial battles. Aggregating anemones have specialized tentacles called acrorhagi that are used solely to deter other colonies from encroaching on their space. When a polyp makes physical contact with a non-clonemate, it extends the acrorhagi to attack the competing anemone with stinging cells called nematocytes. Acrorhagi of the attacking anemone leave behind a 'peel' of the ectoderm and nematocysts that causes tissue necrosis in the receiving animals.\n\nA study of two colonies on a boulder removed from the shore and brought into a laboratory revealed that hostilities between neighboring colonies follow the tides. As water rushed into the tank, warrior polyps inflated their acrorhagi, tripled their body length and began reaching into an empty swath of rock between the colonies. Occasionally, a polyp from one of the colonies would move into the spatial zone between the two colonies, acting as a scout, and would be attacked by the warrior polyps of the other clone. If the scout polyp received enough stings, it would be attacked by its clonemates upon return to its own colony. The return of an attacked scout to the clone with acrorhagial peel may serve to communicate the presence and identity of neighboring clones to the interior of the colony.\n\nThe few known predators of the aggregating anemone include a species of nudibranch (\"Aeolidia papillosa)\", leather star, and mosshead sculpin.\n"}

Kolhapur and the temple is located on the banks of the Panchganga River, it is about 230km south of Pune.\n\n Temple of the goddess Ambabai was built during Chalukya reign. Mounted on a stone platform, the \"murti\" of the crowned goddess is made of gemstone and weighs about 40 kilograms. The image of Mahalakshmi carved in black stone is 3 feet in height. The Shri Yantra is carved on one of the walls in the temple. A stone lion (the vahana of the goddess), stands behind the statue. The crown contains an image of the Sheshnag, the serpent of Vishnu.\n\nIn her four hands, the deity of Mahalakshmi holds objects of symbolic value. The lower right hand holds a \"mhalunga\" (a citrus fruit), in the upper right, a large mace (\"kaumodaki\") the mace of Vishnu with its head touching the ground, in the upper left a shield and in the lower left, a bowl (\"panpatra\"). Unlike most Hindu sacred images, which face north or east, the deity faces West (Pashchim). There is a small open window on the western wall, through which the light of the setting sun falls on the face of the image for three days around the 21st of each March and September.\n\nThere are a number of other shrines in the courtyard to the Navagrahas, Surya, Mahishasuramardini, Vitthal-Rakhmai, Shiva, Vishnu, Tulja Bhavani and others. Some of these images date back to the 11th century, while some are of recent origin. Also located in the courtyard is the temple tank “Manikarnika Kund”, on whose bank is a shrine to Visweshwar Mahadev.\n\nThe temple belongs architecturally to the Chalukya empire and was first built in the 7th century. The temple is referred to in multiple Puranas. There is evidence to show that the Konkan king Kamadeo, Chalukyas, Shilahara, Yadavas of Devagiri dynasties visited this city. Adi Shankaracharya also visited. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj & Sambhaji reigned.\nIn 109 A.D, Karnadeo cut off the jungle and brought the temple to light. The existence goes back to the 8th century, according to Dr. Bhandarkar & Mr. Khare. In the 8th century, the temple sank down due to earthquake. In the 9th century, Gandavadix (King) extended the temple by building Mahakali Mandir. During 1178–1209, in the reign of Raja Jaysing & Sindhava, South gate & Atibaleshwar Temple were built. In 1218, Yadav king Tolum built Mahadwar, and offered jewels to Devi. Further, Shilaharas built Maha Sarasvati Mandir. He being a Jain, got 64 idols carved. It is possible that new idol called Padmavati was installed at that time. Further, in Chalukya times, Ganapati before the temple was installed. In the 13th century, Shankaracharya built Nagar Khana & Office, Deepmalas.\n\nLater during the time of maratha empire, the temple was repaired. Though many invasions over this part of India have caused some damages of the beautiful idols which are all around the temple.\n\nDuring 1712–1792 (Sambhaje Reign) Narhar Bhat Shastree had a dream which he told to Sambhajee. In the Mughal reign, the worshippers had hidden the idol for protection. Believing Sangavakar's dream, Sambhajee started a search. This idol was found in a house in Kapila Teertha Market in the city. According to Sambhaji's letter dated 8 November 1723, Sindhoji Hindurao Ghorpade of Panhala installed the idol again on 26 September 1712 (Monday, Ashwin Vijiya Dashami). The number of devotees grew, and in due course of time, the Devi became the Deity of Maharashtra. The deity began to denude due to Abhishekas. So Sankeshwar Shankaracharya got it repaired. After Vajralep & sacrifices, it was again installed at the hands of Kolhapur Shahajee Raje in 1954. There are 5 main temples and 7 Deepamalas now. Around are 35 temples of various sizes and 20 shops. There are 5 Hemad-style tops and a Garud Mandap.\n\nHistorian Paul Dundas in his book \"The Jains\" mentions that Mahalaxmi temple Kolhapur was a Jain temple. Sheshashayee Vishnu which is an octagonal structure closer to the eastern gate has a panel of 60 Jain Tirthankaras carvings. \n\nWorship services are offered each day throughout the year. Daily schedule is as follows:\n\nSpecial Events: A festival image of the deity is taken out in procession around the temple courtyard each Friday, and on full moon days.\n\nKirnotsav (lit. festival of Sun Rays) is celebrated in the Mahalakshmi Temple at Kolhapur, when the rays of the sun fall directly on the deity at the time of sunset. It is said that the Sun god pays his homage to Mahalakshmi Ambabai for three days in a year. This will be on the occasion of “Rath Saptami”.\n\n\nIt is not surprising that even the rays of a setting sun pay homage to Goddess Mahalakshmi Ambabai as the life of human being revolves around illumination and prosperity. But it is the wonder of wise architects who built the temple of Mahalakshmi at Kolhapur that the rays of the setting Sun, bow at the feet of the Goddess through a window, for a while before vanishing. It is the architect's excellence, which was done more than 1000 years ago, and can still be observed. This special event is celebrated by thousands of people as Kiranotsav.\n\nEvery year during Navratri, on the fifth day of Lalitapanchami, a palkhi procession is taken from the Mahalaxmi temple to Temblai mandir at Temblai hill.\n\n"}
{"id": "2066802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066802", "title": "Art Barr", "text": "Art Barr\n\nArthur Leon Barr (October 8, 1966 – November 23, 1994) was an American professional wrestler. While he wrestled briefly for World Championship Wrestling, he found his greatest success in Mexico's Asistencia Asesoría y Administración promotion.\n\nWhile growing up, Barr became friends with Roddy Piper during Piper's stint in the Oregonian Pacific Northwest Wrestling. While attending Oregon State University, Barr became an accomplished amateur wrestler, having become a four-time district champion and a two-time state champion. However, he later dropped out of college to tend to his wife when she became pregnant.\n\nBarr had three brothers: Jesse, who was also a wrestler, JR and Sean. His father, Sandy, was also involved in wrestling as a wrestler, referee and promoter. Sandy died on June 2, 2007.\n\nAfter leaving college, Barr began working in a steel mill during the day while he began receiving training to become a wrestler from his father Sandy, his older brother Jesse Barr, and Matt Osborne at night. On April 2, 1987, Barr debuted in the Pacific Northwest Wrestling territory. About a year and a half later, at the suggestion of Roddy Piper, he began wrestling as \"Beetlejuice\", based on the title character of the 1988 movie. The character, wearing face paint and flour in his hair, was a cartoonish fan favorite.\n\nAfter the trial, Barr's license to wrestle in Oregon was not renewed, stemming from a previous conviction for possession of cocaine that he did not disclose on his license application. About this time, a tape of Barr as Beetlejuice was sent to the offices of WCW president Jim Herd. WCW was even with WWF in adult demographics, but was losing badly among the child demographics. Herd decided to hire Barr, even though booker Ole Anderson thought Barr was too small to work in the company. Barr joined World Championship Wrestling in 1990 and was renamed \"The Juicer\" in order to avoid copyright conflicts, but he retained his character. Due to a faxing campaign, his sexual assault conviction followed him, which along with his small stature in a wrestling world then dominated by large wrestlers, he lost support and was soon released.\n\nAfter his release, Barr worked a few spot shows for the Pacific Northwest Wrestling promotion in Washington state, as he was banned from working Oregon by the state's commission.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Barr was brought into Mexico's Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre promotion by Konnan. He initially wrestled under a mask as \"The American Love Machine\", and was very successful. A year after entering EMLL, the American Love Machine faced off against another masked wrestler, Blue Panther, in a mask versus mask match. 18,000 fans sold out the 17,000 seat Arena México in Mexico City and another 8,000 fans watched on big screen TV in the parking lot to see the card. The match ended when American Love Machine performed a piledriver (Martinete in Spanish) against Blue Panther, an illegal move in Mexican wrestling, thus losing his mask.\n\nSoon afterward, Barr left EMLL to join Konnan's newly formed Asistencia Asesoría y Administración promotion. As \"The Love Machine\" Art Barr, he debuted in AAA as a villain, and formed the tag team \"La Pareja del Terror\" (The Pair of Terror) with Eddie Guerrero. The pair were highly successful, as they would go on to win the World Tag Team Championship and become arguably the most hated tag team in lucha libre history. Barr and Guerrero expanded their tag team into a faction after being joined by Konnan, Black Cat, Madonna's Boyfriend, Jake Roberts, Misterioso, Chicano Power and King Lion. Together, the faction became known as Los Gringos Locos (The Crazy Americans).\n\nDespite both the acclaim and the financial success he received, Barr's time in Mexico took a toll on him, as he was reportedly homesick (his wife and son remained in Oregon while he was working in Mexico). Eventually, he turned to alcohol and drugs for solace, despite the concern of his friends in the business.\n\nOn November 6, 1994, AAA held the When Worlds Collide pay-per-view card (with some help from WCW) at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. La Pareja del Terror faced off against El Hijo del Santo and Octagón in a double hair versus mask match, which was acclaimed as one of the greatest pay-per-view matches ever and would receive a 5 star rating from Dave Meltzer. Around this time, Barr and Guerrero were also in talks with Extreme Championship Wrestling.Barr confirmed this in a shoot interview with Los Angeles media following the PPV, and said that he looked forward to competing in ECW, \"they're not the biggest promotion but they're the hottest and a very forward thinking promotion\". Barr additionally was scheduled to compete at New Japan's annual Tokyo Dome show on January 4, 1995 in a match with Jushin Thunder Liger however this never materialised.\n\nAt the same time, the World Wrestling Federation, World Championship Wrestling also showed interest in the tag team of Guerrero and Barr however it never got past that stage.\n\nAt Triplemania XXIV, Barr was posthumously inducted into the AAA Hall of Fame as the 2016 inductee. He is regarded as the most hated rudo the company has ever had along with his tag team partner Eddie Guerrero as Los Gringos Locos.\n\nBarr made his New Japan Pro Wrestling debut as \"American Machine\" in Summer 1994, wrestling under an old American Love Machine mask. His debut match was a 6-Man Tag involving himself, Black Cat & Black Tiger II against Shinjiro Otani, El Samurai & Jushin Liger, in which Machine's team won. Liger apparently had big plans to feud with Barr, but they never materialized after Liger broke his ankle. A match was planned for January 4th 1995 at the Tokyo Dome for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Title, but again this never materialised due to Barr's death in November 1994.\n\nOn November 23, 1994, Barr was found dead lying with his child at his home in Springfield, Oregon. Preliminary reports said that he died of heart failure, but later reports said that he died under unknown circumstances. Barr did not have heart problems, no aneurysm or internal bleeding, and no ring injuries. He had a mixture of alcohol and drugs in his blood stream. Although Eddie Guerrero's book claims that the cause of Barr's death is still unknown to this day, \"Hardcore History\" by Scott E. Williams, criminal-justice reporter and wrestling columnist for \"The Galveston County Daily News\", states that \"Barr died in his sleep from a drug-related heart attack.\" Chris Jericho states in his autobiography, \"A Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex\", that he believed Barr's death to be an accidental pill overdose.\n\nAfter his death, Eddie Guerrero adopted Barr's trademark frog splash as his finishing maneuver in tribute to him. According to Guerrero, when they began tagging he first used the frog splash as the \"Jackknife Splash.\" Barr took a liking to the move, began using it regularly and adopted it as his finisher. 2 Cold Scorpio commented to Barr that he \"looked like a frog\", thus leading Barr to name his move the frog splash. It has since become a trademark move of several wrestlers in Mexico, Japan, and the United States.\n\nDave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer wrote that Barr and his tag team partner Eddie Guerrero changed Lucha Libre forever. “Art Barr and Eddie Guerrero broadened the style of Lucha Libre, Art opened their eyes to his style and made the young guys like Rey Misterio Jr, Psicosis and Juventud Guerrera who came up from AAA to WCW into the best workers in the world. He and Eddie had that much influence. Art taught them a whole lot.”\n\nChris Jericho said of Barr in his book, , “I think if Art Barr was still alive today he would be one of the top guys in the business, He had such good personality and the ability to piss people off. He drew such big houses for AAA it was scary how good he could been.”\n\nEddie Guerrero himself also paid tribute Barr on his Cheating Death, Stealing Life DVD produced by WWE: \"I learned so much from Art,\" admitted Guerrero. \"He could make the fans laugh, he could make them cry and he could make them pissed off. He made me realize there's more to wrestling than just wrestling. He helped me change my personality in the ring. He had a big effect on me...\"I cried three months straight when he passed away. He changed everything.\"\n\nKonnan said that Art Barr was one of the greatest talents he'd ever stepped into the ring with.\n\nOn July 16, 1989, Barr had a sexual encounter with a 19-year-old girl after a PNW card in Pendelton, Oregon; the girl later filed rape charges. Barr continued to wrestle as Beetlejuice, despite the charges and the attention brought to him and PNW by the \"Portland Oregonian\". A year later, Barr was polygraphed as part of the police investigation, during which he admitted the girl did not consent, but he believed she would have been willing to have sex someplace else. Barr worked a plea-bargain, and was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse. He was fined $1,000, placed on two years probation, and sentenced to 180 hours of community service, but served no jail time. Barr always maintained that he would have beaten the case in court, but was advised to take the plea since it involved no jail time. Also if he lost, the bad publicity would harm the local wrestling business, driving away customers.\n\n\n\n"}

It was designed by Roger Gohl, at the time a student at the Herron School of Art. The white star represents the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, and its centralization the fact that Indianapolis is the state capital of Indiana. The white circle and the red field within it depict Monument Circle. The color red also signifies \"the driving energy and urge for progress that has made the City of Indianapolis race ahead.\" The four white stripes represent North and South Meridian Streets vertically, and East and West Market Streets horizontally (the streets that radiate from Monument Circle), along with the city's unofficial motto, the Crossroads of America. The four quadrants of dark blue symbolize the residential areas of the city. The colors of the flag are the same as the flag of the United States.\n\nThe flag replaced the existing city flag that had been created in 1915. By 1962 city leaders thought that a more modern flag was needed, so the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce sponsored a contest to create a new one, with a prize of $50 for the winning entry. The instructor in one of Gohl's classes at Herron required each member of the class to submit an entry. Gohl's winning entry had the circle and vertical stripe offset to the left rather than being centered; he was unaware of the change until he returned to visit the city in 1969. \n\nThe city flag assumed a new role as the \"de facto\", though not \"de jure\", symbol of Marion County on January 1, 1970, when the City of Indianapolis and Marion County merged their respective governments.\n\nA 2004 survey of flag design quality by the North American Vexillological Association ranked Indianapolis's flag 8th best of 150 American city flags.

Its status as a family and the number of genera included have both varied considerably. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the family has 24 genera, and excludes genera placed in the separate family Onocleaceae. Alternatively, it may be treated as the subfamily Blechnoideae s.l. of a very broadly defined family Aspleniaceae, and include genera others place in Onocleaceae.\n\nMost are ground dwelling, some are climbers, such as \"Stenochlaena\". A characteristic feature of many species is that the young opening fronds are usually tinged with red.\n\nThe family was created by Newman in 1844. In 2014, Christenhusz and Chase submerged it as subfamily Blechnoideae within the family Aspleniaceae and included Onocleaceae in it. The PPG I classification of 2016 restored it to family status.\n\nBlechnaceae is a member of the eupolypods II clade (now the suborder Aspleniineae), in the order Polypodiales. It is related to other families in the clade as in the following cladogram:\nThe number of genera accepted within Blechnaceae (or Blechnoideae when treated as a subfamily) has varied between authors. Christenhusz and Chase (2014), treating the group as a subfamily, describe the situation as follows: \"Blechnoideae comprise three major clades, one corresponding to \"Onoclea\" \"sensu lato\", a second corresponding to \"Woodwardia\", sister to all other species that can be treated as the single genus \"Blechnum\". However, the subclade sister to the rest of \"Blechnum\" \"sensu lato\" contains the vining taxa \"Stenochlaena\", \"Salpichlaena\" and a few non-vining \"Blechnum\" species with long-creeping rhizomes, which may have to be accepted at the generic level pending further studies. \"Brainea\", \"Doodia\", \"Pteridoblechnum\" and \"Sadleria\" belong to \"Blechnum\" sensu lato.\"\n\nPerrie et al. (2014) retained the family rank and excluded \"Onoclea\" as a separate family, Onocleaceae, sister to Blechnaceae. They identified three major clades within the remaining Blechnaceae, which they labelled \"Woodwardia\", super-\"Stenochlaena\" and super-\"Blechnum\", with the latter two as sister groups. They did not consider \"Blechnum\" as monophyletic and recommended revision of intergeneric boundaries, resulting in seven genera.\n\nGasper et al. (2016), independently of Christenhusz and Chase, examined the deeper relationships of the \nBlechnaceae, retaining its family status and excluding Onocleaceae, and allocated the three major clades of Perrie et al. (2014) to subfamilies: Woodwardioideae, Stenochlaenoideae and Blechnoideae. Their approach to the polyphyletic nature of \"Blechnum\" was to create a series of monophyletic segregate genera, resulting in 24 genera in total. The relationship between the three subfamilies was found to be as follows:\nIn 2016, the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group followed Gasper et al. (2016) in accepting 24 genera, grouped into three subfamilies with approximately 265 species, most of which are placed in the subfamily Blechnoideae.\n\nSubfamily Woodwardioideae \nSubfamily Stenochlaenoideae \nSubfamily Blechnoideae \n\n\n"}

It is sometimes called an \"on the rise shot\", or \"short hop\".\n\nThe player who is hitting the half volley should not take a full backswing, but should still follow through. The grip for this shot is a standard continental. Also, staying down when hitting the shot is very important, or else it will go long. This is the basic form for the volley, hence the name: half volley. The two parts of the tennis court where this shot is generally used are on the baseline and the service line.\n\nA half volley is a difficult shot to make. Often a player hits a half volley only when forced by the opponent or caught out of position. \n\nThe half-volley came to prominence in the hands of George Caridia and Ernest Lewis in the early 1900s.\nArguably the greatest half-volleyer in history is John McEnroe; other professionals such as Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras and Roger Federer had excellent half volleys that were used as weapons.\n\nIn his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \"HALF-VOLLEY—Gonzales and Rosewall. Kenny had to learn to hit a half-volley because his serve was so weak that he had to pick up shots at his feet as he came to the net. With his great serve, I don't know why Gorgo had to hit so many half-volleys, but he sure learned how.\"\n\n"}

The leaves are 10–60 cm long and 3–6 cm broad, with sori arranged in rows perpendicular to the rachis.\n\n\"A. scolopendrium\", with its close relative \"A. sagittatum\", has also been placed in a segregate genus \"Phyllitis\". \"A. scolopendrium\" forms hybrids with other \"Asplenium\" species, including those species sometimes classified in the separate genus \"Camptosorus\", which is one reason that both \"Phyllitis\" and \"Camptosorus\" species are now generally included in \"Asplenium\". On the other hand, a recent phylogenetic study of the family Aspleniaceae suggests that \"A. scolopendrium\" is only distantly related to other \"Asplenium\" species, and that the genus \"Phyllitis\" should again be recognized.\n\n\"Asplenium scolopendrium\" is a common diploid species in Europe. In North America it occurs in rare, widely scattered populations that have been given varietal status, \"A. scolopendrium\" var. \"americanum\". Morphological differences are minor, but the North American populations are tetraploid.\n\nThe plants grow on neutral and lime-rich substrates, including moist soil and damp crevices in old walls, most commonly in shaded situations but occasionally in full sun; plants in full sun are usually stunted and yellowish in colour, while those in full shade are dark green and luxuriant. The rare occurrences of the North American form in the southeastern US are found exclusively in sinkhole pits. These populations may be relics of cooler Pleistocene climates.\n\nIn the United States, \"A. scolopendrium\" var. \"americanum\" was declared endangered in 1989. The reason that the European variety is relatively widespread, and the American variety a rarity, has apparently not been established. A third variety, \"A. scolopendrium\" var. \"lindenii\", occurs in southern Mexico and Hispaniola.\n\n\"A. scolopendrium\" var. \"americanum\" grows in a small number of caves in the United States, two of them being in Alabama. One is Fern Cave, a public cave in Jackson County, Alabama, where it has declined heavily due to illegal plant collecting. The other is located at an undisclosed pit in Morgan County that is off limits due to the land around it being both protected by private landowners and the National Speleological Society.\n\n\"Asplenium scolopendrium\" is often grown as an ornamental plant, with several cultivars selected with varying frond form, including with frilled frond margins, forked fronds and cristate forms. The species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, as has the cultivar \n'Angustatum'. \n\nThe American variety is reputed to be difficult to cultivate, and even in North America most, if not all, cultivated plants are derived from the European forms.\n\nThis fern was used in the 1800s as a medicinal plant in folk medicine as a spleen tonic and for other uses.\n\n\n"}

The Māori language name of the plant is \"tātarāmoa\".\nTātaramoa or bush lawyer has hooked thorns that snag clothing and rip or prick the skin.\n\nThe colloquial English name is often said to have been given because once this thorny plant becomes attached to you it will not let you go until it has drawn blood:\nSome overseas trampers might not understand or appreciate the common name of \"Rubus cissoides\", but North Americans certainly do. In New Zealand the thorny vine is best known as bush lawyer. Found throughout the country up to 1000m, the plant has hand-shaped leaves with three to five toothed 'fingers', white flowers and a yellowish-red fruit. The berry is shaped like a small blackberry and was once used by early Europeans to make jams and jellies. But the plant's most noticeable feature is its thorns.\nThe backward-pointing prickles on the stems help the vine climb to the open canopy of a forest but also snare unwary trampers who stray from the track.

These edifices are associated with alternative worship and the emerging church movements, and seek to find new forms and approaches to existing as a church in the 21st century. These churches are often focused on relationship aspects of Christian fellowship and outreach to their local community, and use the modern gathering place of a café in their ministry.\n\nThe cafe church can be viewed as an organically based philosophy for planting churches, centered around the idea of making the message of Christ's love relevant to the needs of the local community that the church seeks to serve.\n\nThe \"Alma Mount Hope Coffeehouse Church\", of Alma, MI, says:\n\n\"The ministry statement for AMH Coffeehouse Church is found in Acts 2:42: 'And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.'\" \n\nThe goal of cafe church endeavors is to impact their local community with a message of God's love and the transforming power of Christ's love.\n\nDepending on the leadership, some cafe church leaders will provide a clear doctrinal perspective, while others may be more open-minded and comfortable with members and visitors asking questions of speakers.\n\nFor example, \"One World Coffeehouse\" in Columbia, Maryland was founded by a church member who said, \"I felt that our church needed an outreach effort ... and a way to express principles such as multiculturalism and acceptance of others different from yourself.\"\n\nAnd the \"Glebe Café Church,\" in New South Wales, Australia states that:\n\n\"Café Church is a Glebe-based, non-traditional Christian faith community. We aim to provide an inclusive, accepting and welcoming space for everybody, no matter what their spiritual path. Café Church revolves around open discussion, creative expression and alternative approaches to worship. Our core values include hospitality, creativity, discipleship and social and environmental justice.\"\nChurches using the cafe as a model for their organization can take different forms. Some cafe churches maintain a permanent cafe or restaurant, which offers the local community a high-quality array of coffee, sandwiches, and food, and provides a venue where the members of the church fellowship meet. Church members may also volunteer their time to support the enterprise.\n\nOther churches simply use the cafe model as a way to build community, facilitating variation within their normal service structure and within the confines of their building, by serving coffee after or during the service in a predesignated area, or holding a coffeehouse event.\n\n\"Ebenezer's Coffeehouse\", in Washington, DC, operated by the National Community Church, is one example of a cafe church. Its website asks, \"How much more comfortable can you get sipping a Chai in church?\" This church is a multi-location church located at sites accessible by public transit, which links its indie music coffeehouse broadcasts to other locations via the Internet.\n\nAlso located in Washington is the \"Potters House,\" an outreach ministry of the Church of the Savior. Its website states, \"We, the members of that church, asked ourselves, 'Would Jesus want to hang out with folks at a traditional institutional church? or would he want to hang out over a beer in a bar or coffee in a restaurant?' The resounding answer was the latter. We chose coffee over beer because of our support for the budding AA movement in 1960.\"\n\n\"The Abbey\" is a ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama which opened in Birmingham's Avondale neighborhood in 2015. After operating as both a coffeeshop and worshiping congregation for over four years, the coffeehouse was closed in summer 2019. The Abbey continues to operate a six-day-a-week ministry with pay-as-you-can breakfast on weekdays and Sunday worship services.\n\nAn old congregation house of Oxford University, dating back to 1320, is home to \"The Vaults and Garden Cafe\", operated by the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, which specializes in organically grown and locally sourced foods. The cafe serves the community by catering events, and donating funds. Another religious organization specializing in healthy food is the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, which runs a chain of vegetarian restaurants called \"Govinda's\".\n\n\"The Loft\" coffeehouse, a project of Alamo Heights United Methodist Church, San Antonio, TX includes \"a food bank, thrift store and a resource center for the needy.\"\n\nCafé churches became more popular in the Christian community of South Korea around 2016, especially among younger Protestants, as an alternative to the traditional Korean megachurches' conservatism and perceived corruption.\n\nChurch-sponsored coffeehouses have a long history in the United States. For example, Nameless Coffeehouse has operated for over 50 years (since 1966) on the site of The First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Cambridge, MA. And fifty years ago, it was \"The Sacred Mushroom\" coffeehouse in Columbus, OH that hosted Phil Ochs; a local fan reminisced, \"One of his first public performances as a solo artist was at the First Unitarian Universalist Church on Weisheimer Road, where he performed for a ladies luncheon,\" she said with a laugh ... \"God only knows the songs he performed there.\"\nIn fact, Unitarian Universalists are a denomination particularly known for sponsoring folk coffeehouses.\n\n\"The welcoming environment of Unitarian Universalist coffeehouses has provided an artistic haven for a variety of performers and helped launch the entertainment careers of folk musicians such as Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie.\nFolk music is featured at \"The Old Ship Coffeehouse Off The Square\", located in the parish house of Old Ship Church in Hingham, MA, (which is, incidentally, \"the oldest English church in continuous use in America.\")\nThe First Congregational Church in Branford, CT sponsors the \"Branford Folk Coffeehouse\", a monthly folk music concert series held in its auditorium.\n\n\"Mom & Pop's Coffeehouse\", a folk concert series held in the sanctuary at United Christian Church in Levittown, PA, uses the altar as the stage, and has been held since 1994.\n\nAnd in 2011, the \"Good Folk Coffeehouse\" began its 21st concert season at the Rowayton United Methodist Church, in Rowayton, CT.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066899", "title": "Purple Rain (song)", "text": "Purple Rain (song)\n\n\"Purple Rain\" is a song by American musician Prince and his backing band The Revolution. It is the title track from the 1984 album of the same name, which in turn is the soundtrack album for the 1984 film of the same name starring Prince, and was released as the third single from the album. The song is a power ballad that combines rock, R&B, gospel, and orchestral music.\n\n\"Purple Rain\" reached No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and stayed there for two weeks, being kept off the top spot by \"Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go\" by Wham! It reached No. 1 in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is considered to be one of Prince's signature songs. Following Prince's death in April 2016, \"Purple Rain\" rose to No. 1 on the US and UK iTunes Charts, allowing it to re-enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, where it reached No. 4. It also re-entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 6, placing two spaces higher than its original peak of No. 8. In France, where it originally peaked at No. 12, \"Purple Rain\" reached No. 1 around a week after Prince's death.\n\n\"Purple Rain\" is ranked at No. 144 on \"Rolling Stone\" list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. During the 2007 Super Bowl halftime show, for which Prince was the featured performer, \"Purple Rain\" was the last song of his set; the event became especially notable when actual rain started to fall during the performance while the stage stadium were lit up with purple lights, and the show continues to top lists of the best Super Bowl halftime shows of all time. Prince performed the song as the opening of a medley of his hits with Beyoncé at the 2004 Grammy Awards. It was also the final song he performed live, taking place at the end of his final performance in Atlanta on April 14, 2016, one week before he died.\n\n\"Purple Rain\" was originally written as a country song and intended to be a collaboration with Stevie Nicks. According to Nicks, she received a 10-minute instrumental version of the song from Prince with a request to write the lyrics, but felt overwhelmed. She said: \"I listened to it and I just got scared. I called him back and said, 'I can't do it. I wish I could. It's too much for me.'\" At a rehearsal, Prince then asked his backing band to try the song: \"I want to try something before we go home. It's mellow.\" According to Lisa Coleman, Prince then changed the song after Wendy Melvoin started playing guitar chords to accompany the song: \"He was excited to hear it voiced differently. It took it out of that country feeling. Then we all started playing it a bit harder and taking it more seriously. We played it for six hours straight and by the end of that day we had it mostly written and arranged.\"\n\nPrince explained the meaning of the song as follows: \"When there's blood in the sky... red and blue = purple. Purple rain pertains to the end of the world and being with the one you love and letting your faith/god guide you through the purple rain.\" The title track of Prince's preceding album, \"1999\", included similar references to a doomed ending under a purple sky (\"...could have sworn it was Judgment Day, the sky was all purple...\").\n\n\"Purple Rain\" opens with a lone guitar quickly followed by live drumming and a prominent Yamaha CP70 Electric grand piano, evoking images of church gospel music. Three verses are each followed by a chorus, with a building emotional delivery. In the context of the film, each verse ties into a different strained relationship Prince's character has and his desire to reconcile. The song is dedicated to his father in the movie, not ex-girlfriend Denise Matthews better known as Vanity. After the final chorus, a guitar solo takes over the song. The song ends with a piano solo and orchestral strings. Prince's vocal range spans from the low note of Bb2 to the high note of C#6.\n\nThe song was recorded during a benefit concert for the Minnesota Dance Theatre at the First Avenue nightclub in Minneapolis on August 3, 1983. The performance was guitarist Wendy Melvoin's live debut with The Revolution, at the age of 19. \"City Pages\" described the 70-minute performance as Prince's \"sweatiest and most soulful hometown concert yet\", and drummer Bobby Z stated, \"it certainly was one of the best concerts we ever did\".\n\nThe concert was recorded by David Rivkin (also known as David Z, brother of Bobby Z) using a mobile recording unit brought in from the Record Plant in New York City, staffed by engineers Dave Hewitt and Koster McAllister. David's older brother Cliff Rifkin was the regional promotion executive for Warners in Minneapolis, who also expedited Prince's label signing. David Z's younger brother, Bobby Z, would then become Prince's drummer in the Revolution. David Z was not surprised when he was requested to set up the live recording on August 3, 1983, \"With Prince, you never knew,\" he declared. \"I thought we were recording a concert, but I wasn't sure if it was going to be a record, too. I knew they were working on the movie as, as well. You just had to go in prepared to record whatever it was going to be as well as you could.\" The basic tracks for three songs were used on the \"Purple Rain\" soundtrack: \"Purple Rain\", \"I Would Die 4 U\", and \"Baby I'm a Star\". Prince performed overdubs while working at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles from August to September 1983. A solo and the third verse from the original recording were edited out, changing the length from eleven to eight minutes. The extra verse was about money but was removed because it diluted the emotional impact of the song.\n\nAfter recording the song, Prince phoned Jonathan Cain from Journey to ask him to listen to it, as he was worried that it might be too similar to \"Faithfully\", a Journey single composed by Cain which had recently been in the charts. Cain reassured Prince by telling him that the songs only shared the same four chords. Lisa Coleman created the string arrangement, played by her brother and friends, that was overdubbed into the song in a studio in Los Angeles.\n\nThe song was a staple of Prince's live performances. He played it on nearly every tour since 1984, except for a period after his when he avoided his older hits for a few years.\n\nAt Super Bowl XLI's halftime show, in which he was the featured performer, \"Purple Rain\" was featured as the last song of Prince's set and was, appropriately, played during a downpour at the stadium; when combined with the purple stage lighting, this created the song's signature image.\n\nPrince performed the song as the opening of a medley of his hits with Beyoncé at the 2004 Grammy Awards, and also at the 2006 Brit Awards.\n\n\"Purple Rain\" ended up being the final song Prince performed live during his final concert in Atlanta, Georgia on April 14, 2016.\n\nFor release as a single, the song was edited down from 8:41 to 4:05.\n\nThe B-side, \"God\", is a much more overtly religious number (Prince's most religious), recalling the book of Genesis. The song also features extensive vocal experimentation. Towards the end, Prince mentions \"The Dance Electric\", which was a song given to former band member André Cymone. In the U.K., the 12\" single also included an instrumental of \"God\", also known as \"Love Theme from \"Purple Rain\", an edited portion of which appears in the film.\n\nThe song ranked number 144 on the \"Rolling Stone\" list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n\"Q\" magazine placed it at number 40 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, and \"Pitchfork\" named it the best song of the 1980s.\n\nThe song is also included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2066904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066904", "title": "Forehand", "text": "Forehand\n\nThe forehand in tennis and other racket sports such as table tennis, squash and badminton is a shot made by swinging the racket across one's body with the hand moving palm-first. In tennis, except in the context of the phrase \"forehand volley\", the term refers to a type of groundstroke—a stroke in which the ball has bounced before it is struck. It contrasts with the backhand, the other type of groundstroke. For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon.\n\nMost forehands are hit with topspin because it helps keep the ball from landing outside the court. On some occasions, such as an \"approach shot\", a player can opt to hit with backspin, which can also be called a 'slice'.\n\nPlayers with great forehands often build their main strategy around it. They set up a point until they have a good chance of striking a powerful forehand to win the point. A well-known tactic is to run around a ball on their backhand side in order to hit a forehand cross-court, called the \"inside-out\" forehand.\n\nThere are four main grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. They are the \"western\", the \"semi-western\", the \"eastern\", and the \"continental\". Some rarer grips include the \"semi-eastern\" and \"extreme-western\" or \"Hawaiian\".\n\nThe \"western\" was widely used in the first two decades of the 20th century. For a number of years the small, apparently frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a \"western\" grip. Few top players used the \"western\" grip after the 1920s, as many of them moved to the \"eastern\" and \"continental\", but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot-making techniques and equipment changed radically, the \"western\" forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. Some consider it to be an extreme or radical grip, however. The maximum amount of topspin can be generated with this grip. Prominent exponents of the western grip include Kei Nishikori, Nadia Petrova, Lleyton Hewitt, Sania Mirza, Robin Söderling, Samantha Stosur, Jack Sock, and Andrea Petkovic.\n\nThe \"extreme-western\" or \"Hawaiian\" grip is a very extreme tennis grip where the player places their knuckle past the 5th bevel on the tennis racket. It's considered by some to be too extreme for tennis, as the optimal strike zone for this grip is very high up and is suitable only for pure spin hitting. Indeed; flattening out a shot at that height is near impossible due to wrist constrictions, and so this grip is suited only for clay court specialists. However, some players are able to take advantage of this grip's massive spin generation due to their defensive play style or height, which allow them to hit the strike zone often. An example would be Florian Mayer. Other players that employ this extreme grip are Nick Kyrgios and Karen Khachanov. On the WTA tour, Anna-Lena Grönefeld and Amélie Mauresmo were well known for using the Hawaiian grip. The Extreme-Western is also known for causing arm and wrist problems if employed incorrectly.\n\nThe \"semi-western\" grip is also widely used today, and falls in between the \"western\" and the \"eastern\". It is popular with players who want to hit a fair amount of topspin, but still want to be able to flatten out the ball for finishing shots. It is currently the most popular forehand grip among ATP and WTA pros, with many top players employing this grip on their forehand. It can be further modified to be closer to a semi-eastern grip, or more extreme to a full-western grip depending on the player's profile and playing style. Many of the world's current players use this grip, such as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, David Ferrer, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Venus and Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Maria Sharapova, and countless other professional tennis players in today's modern game.\n\nA rare grip used in modern tennis, it is a hybrid between the \"eastern\" and \"semi-western\" forehand grips. Its main purpose is a modification over the traditional eastern grip to help develop more spin on the forehand, and thus gives a player more control and options over their shot than a conventional \"eastern\" grip. It's a very versatile grip, allowing multiple ways of hitting the ball, such as the double bend arm or the straight arm, and can be further modified with the wrist and forearm movement for added spin and power. It also can be used to flatten out the ball for a finishing shot or roll over the ball for a more consistent topspin shot without having to change grips. It does however, take a bit longer to master than other forehand grips due to its unique nature and more traditional style, but will present more options when faced with any type of shot.\n\nThe \"eastern\" grip widely replaced the \"western\" in the 1920s and thereafter was used by such World No. 1 players as Ellsworth Vines, Don Budge, and Jack Kramer, all of whom were considered to have very powerful forehands. Many beginners start with the \"eastern\" grip because of its comfortable feel. It is often described as shaking hands with the racquet. Forehands hit with the \"eastern\" can have either topspin or backspin, as the gripping hand is on the same plane as the racquet, and can thus be tilted up for topspin or down for backspin rather easily. Although rarer on the professional tour as it makes hitting topspin somewhat difficult, there are some notable players who use the eastern grip to great effect. Juan Martín del Potro is an excellent example of an eastern forehand user. Roger Federer is often noted as having an eastern grip, although his forehand lies somewhere in between semi-western and eastern. His power and versatility on the forehand side are commonly attributed to this twist on the forehand grip. WTA players who have utilised the eastern grip include Steffi Graf, Justine Henin, Petra Kvitová, Angelique Kerber, and Lindsay Davenport.\n\nThe \"continental\" grip was popular with many Europeans of the 1920s and 1930s and with many Australians of the 1940s and 1950s. The \"continental\" has the advantage of being used for all strokes: serves, volleys, forehands, and backhands, without having to be shifted in the player's hand, as is the case with all the other grips. It is particularly well-suited for hitting low balls — \"taking the ball on the rise\" — but is generally considered inferior for most forehands. It is extremely rare for a modern professional player to utilize a \"continental\" grip, owing to the difficulty of topspin generation and poor ability to hit balls above the strike-zone, crucial in today's heavy topspin game. Richard Gasquet is an example of a player who uses the \"continental\" forehand, but he generally switches his grip over to a semi-western during his takeback process. Fred Perry, the great English player of the 1930s and 1940s was notable for his snap forehand using the continental grip and taking the ball on the rise.\n\nNo matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand with devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. His frequent adversary and even greater player Jack Kramer has called it the single finest shot in the history of tennis. Ellsworth Vines, another great player, agreed. He wrote: \"Two-handed forehand is most outstanding stroke in game's history; unbeatable unless opponent could avoid it.\" \n\nMonica Seles also used a two-handed forehand very effectively, with 53 career titles that included 9 Grand Slam titles. Marion Bartoli won Wimbledon in 2013 with a two-handed forehand. Unusually, both players placed their dominant hand at the base of the racquet, resulting in a cross-handed stroke.\n\nAmong current players Peng Shuai, Ayumi Morita, Yan Zi, and Aiko Nakamura employ two-handed forehands. Peng's forehand is also cross-handed.\n\nSome players will use a two-handed forehand when they need a sure-fire in. The constricted movement will generally generate less power, but more racket head control.\n\nThe classical forehand where a player hit through the ball and finished their follow-through above the shoulder was the dominant forehand usage for most of tennis history. Players as recent as Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi used the classical forehand. With recent tennis racquet technology improvements, generating power has increasingly become easier and hence having more control has become an emphasis for current professional tennis players. This has resulted in the pro players now using a windshield wiper forehand where the follow-through ends up with the racquet ending across the body rather than over the shoulder. This enables more top spin to be imparted to the ball, thus controlling the extra power generated while still keeping the ball in court. Most pro players now use the windshield wiper forehand, with Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among other pro tennis players all employing the windshield wiper forehand.\n\nIn his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a great forehand himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He wrote: \"FOREHAND—Segura was best, then Perry, followed by Tilden and Vines (although I never saw Big Bill's till he was in his forties). Of the moderns, Năstase's forehand is a superb one, especially on the run.\".\n\nAt a professional event in 1951, the forehand drives of a number of players were electronically measured. Pancho Gonzales hit the fastest, at 112.88 mph, followed by Jack Kramer at 107.8 and Welby Van Horn at 104.\n\nIn the 1980s, Ivan Lendl was famous for the smoothness of his forehand and his ability to strike the ball hard, no matter where he was standing on the court.\n\nRoger Federer has been noted to have the one of the greatest forehands in history, described as a \"great liquid whip\" by David Foster Wallace.\n\nThe forehand has been used as a major weapon by many players for years.\n\nAmongst the male players, some of the notable players with great forehands are: \n\nAnd amongst the female players:\n\n"}

It is the administrative seat of the Rhein-Lahn rural district and is well known as a spa on the river Lahn. Bad Ems is the seat of the \"Verbandsgemeinde\" (administrative community) Bad Ems-Nassau. The town has around 9,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe town is located on both banks of the River Lahn, the natural border between the Taunus and the Westerwald, two parts of the Rhenish Slate Mountains. The town and its outer districts are situated within the Nassau Nature Reserve.\n\nIn Roman times, a \"castrum\" was built at Bad Ems as part of the Upper Germanic Limes, but today not much of the structure remains. In the woods around the town, however, there are distinct traces of the former Roman border.\n\nThe town was first mentioned in official documents in 880 and received its town charter in 1324. The Counts of Nassau and Katzenelnbogen rebuilt the bath and used it together with other noble visitors. In the 17th and 18th centuries Bad Ems was considered one of Germany's most famous bathing resorts. It reached its heyday in the 19th century when it welcomed visitors from all over the world and became the summer residence of various European monarchs and artists, including Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, Tsars Nicholas I and Alexander II of Russia, Richard Wagner, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Vasili Vasilyevich Vereshchagin, etc.\n\nIn 1870, the town, then part of Prussian Hesse-Nassau, became known as the place where the Ems Dispatch originated, instigating the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nIn 1876, in the \"Haus Vier Türme\" (Four Tower House), the Ems Edict was signed by Alexander II of Russia, banning the use of the Ukrainian language. Today, a monument at the spot commemorates this historical event.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries a lot of mining for metal ores took place in the town, concentrated on lead, silver, zinc and copper. The Romans had already dug for ores using open cast mining, which continued throughout the Middle Ages. The many indentations on Blöskopf Hill bear witness to this period of history. As time went by, the method changed from open cast mining to underground mining with tunnels and shafts. Mining of this kind is first mentioned in a document dated 1158, and it continued on into the 18th century, although with long interruptions.\n\nThe advent of the Industrial Revolution led to the expansion of the mine, which from 1871 operated under the name of \"Emser Blei- und Silberwerk AG\" (Bad Ems Lead and Silver Works, Inc.). In 1909 the company was taken over by what later became the \"Stolberger Zink AG\" (Stolberg Zinc Inc.) and mining continued until the end of the Second World War brought things to a halt in 1945. After the war, the mine no longer received any subsidies, but until 1959, stockpiled ore and ore from other mines were sorted at the central preparation plant in Silberau.\n\nToday, the mine is still known as \"Mercur\", the collective name for various individual pits. Since 1996, the mine has been set up as a museum.\n\nIndustry in Bad Ems is mainly limited to companies related to its spa status, but nonetheless fairly varied, including medicine, electrical engineering and tourism.\n\nNatural Ems salt is produced from local mineral water.

In 2001, the festival re-focused by holding most events in Queen’s Park (previously, events were held in multiple venues throughout the city). Since the initial move to Queen’s Park, the festival has grown and moved back to multiple venues, including the streets.\n\nDuring the Easter weekend, most of Queen’s Park and some of Toowoomba's CBD was converted into an event precinct, with venue and residential tents, stages and other attractions. During the event setup and packdown, most of Queen's Park was inaccessible to the general public.\n\nIn May 2015, it was announced that Easterfest would not be continuing in 2016.\n\nTens of thousands of people attended the ticketed and free events during three-day festival in 2005, and over 20,000 tickets were allegedly sold in 2006. In 2009, about 40,000 people attended. \n\nIn 2011, Easterfest announced late Saturday night that the program in the main venue, Queens Park, had been cancelled. The creek running right alongside the entrance to the Queen's Park venue, which had been the scene of major flooding earlier this year, became a raging river, making for a precarious exit. Organisers confirmed the tent had partially collapsed but there were no injuries and everyone had been accounted for. Police were closing off roads as the torrential rain turned roads into rapids. Numerous cars were abandoned after they stalled. Ricky Robinson, 18, of Petrie, who was camping at the site said it was like a small river going through the area. The water was up to patron’s knees in the moshpit as the US band Switchfoot played on, despite the deluge. The lead singer Jon Foreman was climbing up the support structures for the giant display screens. \"He was crazy. He was drenched pretty much\" Ricky said. Thousands of people were scrambling through rushing water as they exited Easterfest. Security staff and volunteers first advised people to head to the Big Top but that too was being flooded so many just headed across East Creek to the city and higher ground. Police and fire sirens only added to the drama.\n\nIn 2012, 20,000 were drawn to the festival. \"The noise created by crowds and thumping bass at Easterfest has become one of Toowoomba’s most debated issues. Kevin Farmer, a local resident stated, \"The city is split down the middle between those who love the music festival and its inner-city location and those who want it moved\". Co-ordinator Mr Schenk said: \"We did have at least one breach and worked closely with council to get the noise within the prescribed limit. The biggest challenge came on Saturday night when we had three or four of our venues operating at the same time after 10pm, when the limits drop. Any one stage was okay, but cumulatively they were over the limit.\" Residents have established their own messageboard to publish their grievances. In the wake of the growing popularity of the festival residents have begun to question the publicly stated financial standing of the festival. The festival collects publicly funded subsidies which local government councillors say the festival would not be possible without. Despite more than 20,000 visitors attending the event in 2012, Easterfest was not as financially successful as expected. \n\n \n"}

{"id": "2066929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066929", "title": "XBXRX", "text": "XBXRX\n\nXBXRX is an American rock band formed in 1998 in Mobile, Alabama, United States. Their early sound was new wave-influenced, but is now more improvised and deconstructed, moving away from using the synthesizers that typify new wave. They are a collective with a revolving cast of musicians, including Steve Touchstone, Weasel Walter, and Vice Cooler. In 2002, Wesley Willis wrote a song dedicated to the band. For many years the collective resided in Oakland, California, where they finished working on their last full-length record, \"Wars\", which was released in April 2007. In 2008 they were working on a record of improv based pieces titled \"Sound\" and splits with Mika Miko and Japanther. As of 2010, they have regrouped, and relocated to Los Angeles releasing new music and playing shows around California with their new line up.\n\nOn February 27, 1998, after attending a concert by Unwound and Deerhoof at Jaycee Hall in Biloxi, Mississippi, the band started as a trio, using a simple drum set, guitar and an inexpensive Radio Shack synthesizer. Their early sets consisted of very loose, improvised song structures. After a solid lineup they made their first public performance at a friend's birthday party in May 1998. In 1999, the band hit the road for the first time with a van that belonged to the drummer's mother. Eventually all of the members either graduated early or dropped out and went on tour more or less full time.\n\nIn summer of 2000, the band went into the studio to record some songs with producer Steve Albini. The sessions would turn into the band's first real full length, \"Gop Ist Minee\" which was released on Kill Rock Stars sister label \"5RC\". The album was released in January of the next year and was followed by tours with Unwound, Deerhoof, QandnotU, and the Sissies. In between shows, they recorded their \"Clear\" EP (with Ian Mackaye) and several singles, including the Quintron and Miss Pussycat collaboration single, \"Mardi Gras\", which was recorded by Tim Kerr, and the Vern Rumsey-produced \"Hold Onto Your Skulls\". In 2002, the band took a long break.\n\nWeasel Walter had become a fan of XBXRX after seeing multiple Chicago performances between 1999 and 2001. He had kept in touch with the band, and in 2003, when Touchstone and Cooler moved the band from Alabama to California, they asked Walter to join the band as their new drummer and enlisted Paul Costuros (of Total Shutdown) to fill in on Bass duties.\n\nIn April 2003, they did their first tour with the new lineup, opening for Holy Molar. They quickly started working in the studio and opened for Sonic Youth and Peaches. The end result was a contract with Polyvinyl Records which produced the band's follow up to \"Gop Ist Minee\", \"Sixth in Sixes\".\n\nThe band recorded their next two full-length albums \"Wars\" (Polyvinyl 2007) and \"Sounds\" (Important Records, 2007). While \"Wars\" focuses on their punk and new wave background, \"Sounds\" was dedicated to the opposite: studio experiments and improvised material which had only been reserved for their live shows.\n\nThey toured with Melt Banana.\n\n\"Un Usper\" was released on June 3, 2009 as the band's latest album. It is mixed, produced, and released by the band as a download only, donation based record.\n\n\"O\" is a 10-song 7\" which was released in September 2010 on Polyvinyl Records. \"O\" is a return to form for the band harkening back to their \"Sixth in Sixes\" era.

{"id": "2066931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066931", "title": "Seal of Indiana", "text": "Seal of Indiana\n\nThe Seal of the State of Indiana is used by the Governor of Indiana to certify official documents. The seal has gone through several revisions since the region was a part of the Northwest Territory. It is likely the original seal, which is similar to the current one, was created by William Henry Harrison during his administration of the Indiana Territory. The current design of the seal was standardized by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963.\n\nThe state seal is maintained by the Governor of Indiana. It is used to certify the authenticity of official state documents. The seal is placed on departmental reports, bills the Governor signs into law, and official communications from the Governor to other high-ranking office holders. The seal is also used on all commissions granted by the state as proof of the commission's authority.\n\nThe United States Congress passed legislation on May 8, 1792, that directed the U.S. Secretary of State to \"provide proper seals for the several and respective public offices in the said Territories\". Indiana was part of the Northwest Territory at that time and a seal was created by the United States Department of State to be used on official papers of the territory. The original seal was maintained by Governor Arthur St. Clair and the first recorded use was in a proclamation made on July 26, 1788.\n\nOn May 10, 1800, the Indiana Territory was created by an act of Congress, but no provision for an official seal was included in the measure. The earliest recorded use of Indiana Territory's seal was on court documents that were signed by Governor William Henry Harrison in January 1801. The seal he used was an adaptation of the original seal created for the Northwest Territory. Although its origin is uncertain, it is likely that it was Harrison who made the alterations.\n\nThe constitution of 1816 contained a clause that stated the governor should maintain a state seal and use it in official communication. The design of the seal was first proposed during the first session of the Indiana General Assembly in 1816. On November 22, 1816, representative Davis Floyd of Harrison County proposed the adoption of a seal with a design he referred to as \"A forest and a woodman felling a tree, a buffalo leaving the forest and fleeing through the plain to a distant forest, and sun in the west with the word Indiana.\" The bill was put through a joint conference of both houses of the General Assembly and funds where voted to purchase a printer to create the seal.\n\nIn 1819, the state seal was part of a state crisis. Lieutenant Governor Christopher Harrison became acting-governor when Governor Jonathan Jennings was away conducting negotiations with northern Indiana's native tribes. When Jennings returned, Harrison refused to step down as governor, claiming that Jennings' actions had invalidated his governorship. Harrison seized the state seal and set up his own governor's office. After several weeks of debate in the state legislature, Harrison was forced to return the seal to Jennings and vacate the office of the governor.\n\nDuring 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, the reading clerk of the Indiana Senate, was directed to ascertain the legal status of the design of the state seal. After a thorough review, Hatcher found that the laws that authorized the seal did not explicitly state what its design should be. He recommended that a bill be passed to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it.\n\nOn January 28, 1905, an article ran in the \"Indianapolis News\" containing information on the origin of the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.\n\nThe current design of the seal was standardized by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. During the meeting of the General Assembly, Representative Taylor I. Morris introduced legislation to standardize the design of the state seal. His bill described a seal that depicts a woodsman chopping a sycamore tree, while an American Bison runs in the foreground and the sun rises in the background. The leaves of the state tree, the tulip, were to be the border design. The bill passed the assembly that session and became law.\n\nIn 2004, the 1963 statute came under criticism because it states the sun in the state seal is \"setting\" rather than \"rising\". A thorough investigation by the Indiana Historical Bureau into the history of the seal led to the discovery that original seal was created with the intention that the sun should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change the wording of the statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.\n\nThe law created to standardize the state seal has been in effect since 1963. The stature states:\n\nIndiana State Code: IC 1-2-4-1\nThe official seal for the state of Indiana shall be described as follows:\nA perfect circle, two and five eighths (2 5/8) inches in diameter, inclosed by a plain line. Another circle within the first, two and three eighths (2 3/8) inches in diameter inclosed by a beaded line, leaving a margin of one quarter (1/4) of an inch. In the top half of this margin are the words \"Seal of the State of Indiana\".\n\nAt the bottom center, 1816, flanked on either side by a diamond, with two (2) dots and a leaf of the tulip tree (liriodendron tulipifera), at both ends of the diamond. The inner circle has two (2) trees in the left background, three (3) hills in the center background with nearly a full sun setting behind and between the first and second hill from the left.\n\nThere are fourteen (14) rays from the sun, starting with two (2) short ones on the left, the third being longer and then alternating, short and long. There are two (2) sycamore trees on the right, the larger one being nearer the center and having a notch cut nearly half way through, from the left side, a short distance above the ground. The woodsman is wearing a hat and holding his ax nearly perpendicular on his right. The ax blade is turned away from him and is even with his hat.\n\nThe buffalo is in the foreground, facing to the left of front. His tail is up, front feet on the ground with back feet in the air, as he jumps over a log.\n\nThe ground has shoots of blue grass, in the area of the buffalo and woodsman.\n\nThe sun rising in the picture represents that Indiana has a bright future ahead and is just beginning. The mountains it rises over are a representation of the Allegheny Mountains showing that Indiana is in the west. The woodman represents civilization subduing the wilderness that was Indiana. The buffalo represents the wilderness fleeing westward away from the advancing civilization.\n\n"}

As was customary for a laird (landed proprietor in Scotland), MacDonell was often called Glengarry after his principal estate.\n\nGlengarry's haughty and flamboyant personality, as expressed in his character and behaviour, gave Walter Scott the model for the wild Highland clan chieftain Fergus Mac-Ivor in the pioneering historical novel Waverley of 1810. Glengarry was the fifth Lord MacDonell in the Jacobite peerage.\n\nHe was born on 15 September 1773, the eldest of the nine children of Duncan Macdonell (\"c.\" 1744–1788), chief of Clan Macdonell of Glengarry, by his marriage to Marjory Grant (1744–1792), of Dalvey.\n\nIn 1788, he became the 15th chief of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, inheriting huge estates from Glengarry in the Great Glen to Knoydart on the Atlantic. In 1790. he entered University College, Oxford.\n\nIn February 1793, after war with France had begun, Macdonell was commissioned as a Captain to recruit a company of the Strathspey Fencibles, raised by Sir James Grant, a kinsman. In August 1794, he was given a colonel's commission to raise the Glengarry Fencibles regiment of Glengarry Highlanders, recruits being drawn from the Glengarry estates, under threat of eviction if persuasion did not work. Glengarry commanded his regiment in Guernsey until August 1796, when he resigned. His hope of a career as a regular officer in the British Army had been undermined by his commander-in-chief, the Duke of York and Albany, perhaps due to concerns about his character.\n\nAs part of his regiment's uniform, he invented (or adopted) the \"Glengarry\", a type of cap which he is wearing in his portrait. The boat-shaped cap without a peak is made of thick-milled woollen material with a \"toorie\" (or bobble) on the top and ribbons hanging down behind, capable of being folded flat. It has become part of the uniform of a number of Scottish regiments, with variations in the band around above the brim and in the colours.\n\nThe Glengarry fencibles were disbanded in 1802, and Glengarry failed to honour a pledge to find land for the men. This resulted in a mass emigration to British North America led by Father Alexander Macdonell, the regimental chaplain.\n\nHe bitterly feuded with Thomas Telford and the Commissioners of the Caledonian Canal as it was being constructed through his land, though he collected useful dues from them.\n\nGlengarry considered himself the last genuine specimen of a Highland chief, always wore the Highland dress (kilt or trews) and in the style of his ancestors seldom travelled without being followed by his \"tail\", armed servants in full Highland dress who had traditional duties such as carrying his sword and shield, standing sentinel, acting as bard and carrying him dry across streams.\n\nHe was a member of the Highland Society and the Celtic Society of Edinburgh, and in June 1815 formed his own Society of True Highlanders, subsequently leaving the Celtic Society and complaining that \"their general appearance is assumed and fictitious, and they have no right to burlesque the national character or dress of the Highlands\". His mortification at the acceptance of Lowlanders became a bitter complaint about the prominent role the Celtic Society had in the visit of King George IV to Scotland, and he made several unauthorised and flamboyant appearances during the visit, to the annoyance of his friend Walter Scott and the other organisers, but causing no more than mild amusement to the King.\n\nIn 1824 Glengarry unsuccessfully attempted to wrest the chiefship of Clan Donald from Ranald George Macdonald by bringing an action in the Court of Session.\n\nAlthough Scott wrote of Glengarry in his misleading hagiography \"He is a kind of Quixote in our age, having retained, in their full extent, the whole feelings of clanship and chieftainship, elsewhere so long abandoned\", under his authority timber was felled for sale, the cleared land was leased to sheep farmers and many of his clansmen were forced from the land by increasing rents and evictions. He continued the evictions to make way for sheep farmers which his mother began when his father was chieftain, and most of the clan was forced to emigrate to British North America, as part of what was later known as the Highland Clearances. Robert Burns wrote a satirical poem about Glengarry in the .\n\nHis life was in stark contrast to his contemporary relative Bishop Alexander MacDonell who did missionary duty in Lochaber and tried to help his clansmen displaced by the substitution of sheep-farms for smallholdings to get employment in the Lowlands. In 1794 he organised the formation of the 1st Glengarry Fencible regiment, commanded by his kinsman Glengarry, with himself as chaplain. When the regiment was disbanded Father MacDonell arranged a tract of land in Canada in 1804 and went with them.\n\nOn 17 January 1828, Glengarry perished at Corran on Loch Linnhe from an attack of brain fever which followed an accident during his escape from a steamer which had gone aground. \nAccording to the \"Inverness Courier\", the funeral procession of five miles from Invergarry to Kilfinnan was followed by 1,500 men and 150 gentry, the coffin being carried breast-high by eighteen Highlanders. Glengarry's personal piper, Archie Munro, composed a lament, as did the blind household bard, Allan MacDougall. As Brian Osborne records, \"In Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott was moved to compose \"Glengarry's Death Song\", an undoubted expression of his genuine affection for the dead chief, if not perhaps a work of the greatest literary quality\".\n\nOn 20 January 1802, Glengarry married Rebecca, the second daughter of Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet, of Pitsligo. Their children were a son, Aeneas Ranaldson, born on 29 July 1808, and seven daughters, Elizabeth, Marcelly, Jemima Rebecca, Louisa Christian, Caroline Hester, Gulielmina Forbes, and Euphemia Margaret.\n\nGlengarry's estate was much mortgaged and encumbered. In 1840, after his only son and heir, Aeneas Ranaldson MacDonell, had come of age he sold the Glengarry part of the estate to Lord Ward, later Earl of Dudley, for £91,000. Some years later Aeneas sold the Knoydart estate to a Mr Baird. Aeneas died at Invergarry on 19 June 1852, leaving three sons, Alexander Ranaldson (1834-1862), Aeneas Robert (1835-1855) and Charles Ranaldson (1838-1868). Alexander emigrated to Australia and died unmarried in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1862. Aeneas drowned at the age of twenty and Charles died at sea in 1868 on his way home from New Zealand. Of their three sisters, only one, Helen Rebecca, married and had children, and by 1887 she was her father's sole heir. She married in 1865 Captain John Cuninghame of Balgownie, Fife, leaving descendants.\nGlengarry's sixth daughter, Gulielmina, married Hugh Horatio Brown, a Midlothian advocate, and was the mother of the Venice historian Horatio Brown.\n\n\n"}

Members of the enclave are known as the Samaná Americans.\n\nThe language is a relative of African Nova Scotian English and African-American Vernacular English, with variations unique to the enclave's history in the area. In the 1950 Dominican Republic census, 0.57% of the population (about 12,200 people) said that their mother tongue was English.\n\nMost speakers trace their lineage to immigrants who arrived at the peninsula in 1824 and 1825. All of Hispaniola was administered by Haiti, and its president was Jean-Pierre Boyer. The immigrants responded to an invitation for settlement that Jonathas Granville had delivered in person to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and New York City. Abolitionists like Richard Allen, Samuel Cornish, Benjamin Lundy, and Loring D. Dewey joined the campaign, which was coined the Haitian emigration.\n\nThe response was unprecedented, as thousands of African Americans boarded ships in eastern cities and migrated to Haiti. Most of the immigrants arrived during the fall of 1824 and the spring of 1825. More continued moving back and forth in later years but at a slower rate.\n\nBetween 1859 and 1863, another immigration campaign brought new settlers to the island but at a fraction of the number in 1824 and 1825. Those who originally settled in Samana were fewer than 600 but formed the only surviving immigration enclave.\n\nWhile more than 6000 immigrants came in 1824 and 1835, by the end of the 19th century, only a handful of enclaves on the island spoke any variety of the antebellum Black Vernacular. They were communities in Puerto Plata, Samaná and Santo Domingo. The largest was the one in Samaná that maintained church schools, where it was preserved. During the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship (1930–1961), however, the government began a systematic policy of Hispanizing the entire Dominican population. The church schools in which English was taught were eliminated, and the language was discouraged.\n\nEnclaves across the island soon lost an important element of their identity, which led to their disintegration. Samaná English withstood the assaults in part because the location of Samaná was favorable to a more independent cultural life. However, government policies have still influenced the language's gradual decline, which may well now be an endangered language.\n\nThe language is variously described as either a creole language or a dialect of English. It is similar to that of Caribbean English Creoles spoken by the English-speaking Caribbean, especially Turks and Caicos and Bahamian Creole.\n\nThe 15th edition (2005) of Ethnologue dropped it from its list of languages, but linguists still consider it a separate language variety.\n\n\n"}

It forms the northwestern end of the Parry Channel which extends east all the way to Baffin Bay and is thus a possible route for the Northwest Passage. The strait was named for Robert McClure, an Irish Arctic explorer serving in the Royal Navy. He was the first man to traverse the North-West Passage (by boat and sledge).\n\nThe strait connects the Beaufort Sea in the west with Viscount Melville Sound in the east. It is bounded by Prince Patrick Island, Eglinton Island and Melville Island on the north and Banks Island on the south. As the strait is chronically blocked with thick ice, it is usually impassable to ships; in 1969, the United States-registered tanker was freed from the ice by a Canadian icebreaker, and forced to travel through Canadian territorial waters to complete its westward passage. Ice prevented \"Manhattan\" from going through McClure Strait so the vessel sailed through the Prince of Wales Strait. There is a dispute between Canada and the United States over the waters of the Arctic Islands, other than those within of shore.\n\nThe M'Clure Strait became fully open (ice-free) in early August 2007, and again in August 2008. The European Space Agency reported that the Arctic's Northwest Passage opened up fully sea ice free, clearing a lane through the northern section of the historically impassable route between Europe and Asia.\n\nAt 15.33Z on 29 August 2012, the purpose built \"Polar Bound\" under the command of David Scott Cowper with Jane Maufe as crew, was the first private yacht to pass through the strait. Shortly thereafter, the Hallberg-Rassy sailboat \"Belzebub II\", with three sailors aboard, became the first sailboat to travel the route.\n\nThe M'Clure Strait lies within the M'Clure Rift which forms the western end of the Parry Submarine Rift Valley. It is considered an incipient rift zone because little extensional tectonism has taken place on it and no oceanic crust occurs in the middle of the strait.\n\n"}
{"id": "2066949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066949", "title": "Stem-loop", "text": "Stem-loop\n\nStem-loop intramolecular base pairing is a pattern that can occur in single-stranded DNA or, more commonly, in RNA. The structure is also known as a hairpin or hairpin loop. It occurs when two regions of the same strand, usually complementary in nucleotide sequence when read in opposite directions, base-pair to form a double helix that ends in an unpaired loop. The resulting structure is a key building block of many RNA secondary structures. As an important secondary structure of RNA, it can direct RNA folding, protect structural stability for messenger RNA (mRNA), provide recognition sites for RNA binding proteins, and serve as a substrate for enzymatic reactions.\n\nThe formation of a stem-loop structure is dependent on the stability of the resulting helix and loop regions. The first prerequisite is the presence of a sequence that can fold back on itself to form a paired double helix. The stability of this helix is determined by its length, the number of mismatches or bulges it contains (a small number are tolerable, especially in a long helix) and the base composition of the paired region. Pairings between guanine and cytosine have three hydrogen bonds and are more stable compared to adenine-uracil pairings, which have only two. In RNA, adenine-uracil pairings featuring two hydrogen bonds are equal to the adenine-thymine bond of the DNA. Base stacking interactions, which align the pi bonds of the bases' aromatic rings in a favorable orientation, also promote helix formation.\n\nThe stability of the loop also influences the formation of the stem-loop structure. \"Loops\" that are less than three bases long are sterically impossible and do not form. Large loops with no secondary structure of their own (such as pseudoknot pairing) are also unstable. Optimal loop length tends to be about 4-8 bases long. One common loop with the sequence UUCG is known as the \"tetraloop\" and is particularly stable due to the base-stacking interactions of its component nucleotides.\n\nStem-loops occur in pre-microRNA structures and most famously in transfer RNA, which contain three true stem-loops and one stem that meet in a cloverleaf pattern. The anticodon that recognizes a codon during the translation process is located on one of the unpaired loops in the tRNA. Two nested stem-loop structures occur in RNA pseudoknots, where the loop of one structure forms part of the second stem.\n\nMany ribozymes also feature stem-loop structures. The self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme contains three stem-loops that meet in a central unpaired region where the cleavage site lies. The hammerhead ribozyme's basic secondary structure is required for self-cleavage activity.\n\nHairpin loops are often elements found within the 5'UTR of prokaryotes. These structures are often bound by proteins or cause the attenuation of a transcript in order to regulate translation.\n\nThe mRNA stem-loop structure forming at the ribosome binding site may control an initiation of translation.<ref name=\" doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2009.06840.x\"></ref><ref name=\" doi: 10.1007/s00018-010-0588-z\"></ref>\n\nStem-loop structures are also important in prokaryotic rho-independent transcription termination. The hairpin loop forms in an mRNA strand during transcription and causes the RNA polymerase to become dissociated from the DNA template strand. This process is known as rho-independent or intrinsic termination, and the sequences involved are called terminator sequences.\n\n"}
{"id": "2066950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066950", "title": "Backhand", "text": "Backhand\n\nThe backhand is a tennis shot in which one swings the racquet around one's body with the back of the hand preceding the palm. Except in the phrase \"backhand volley\", the term refers to a groundstroke (that is, one in which the ball has bounced before it is struck). It contrasts with the other kind of groundstroke, the forehand. The term is also used in other racquet sports, and other areas where a similar motion is employed (for example while throwing a sport disc).\n\nThe backhand is usually performed from the baseline or as an approach shot. For a right-handed player, a backhand begins with the racquet on the left side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of the body, with the racquet over the right shoulder. The backhand can be a one-handed or two-handed stroke.\n\nDue to the fact that the player's dominant hand \"pulls\" into the shot, the backhand generally lacks the power and consistency of the forehand, and is usually considered more difficult to master. However, the two-handed backhand provides more stability and power for the shot, and is increasingly used in the modern game. Beginner and club-level players often have difficulty hitting a backhand, and junior players may have trouble making the shot if they are not strong enough to hit it. Many advanced players still have a significantly better forehand than backhand, and many strategies in tennis aim to exploit this weakness.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, the backhand was hit with one hand using either an \"eastern\" or \"continental\" grip. The first notable players to use a two-handed backhand were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich. Beginning with Mike Belkin who was the first two-handed backhand player in the United States and Chris Evert in the 1960s, many players began to use a two-handed grip for the backhand. Pete Sampras and Stefan Edberg notably switched from the two-handed to the one-handed backhand late in their development.\n\nPlayers often choose their backhand type based on their hand dominance—if the player is somewhat ambidextrous, the two-handed backhand might be best.\n\nStarting from the 1970s, many of the greatest players used the two-handed backhand and it has become more popular on the pro tour. Two-handed backhands have some important advantages over one-handed backhands:\n\n\nOne-handed backhands have some other important advantages over two-handed backhands:\n\n\nGenerally, both backhands are efficient at what they do. Perhaps the biggest weakness cited by most coaches in regards to the one hander is the fact that it requires more time and steps to be set up properly—it requires an extra half step in order to execute a proper back-swing and have proper control over the point of contact—a traditional one handed backhand is hit from a closed stance with the dominant foot placed in front, whereas the two hander can be hit both from open and closed stance. This can hamper players who use a one handed backhand on fast surfaces as the high speed of most drive shots gives them very little time for preparation and setting up their shot. However, players with a modern one-handed backhand like Dominic Thiem, Stan Wawrinka or Stefanos Tsitsipas can hit it with an open stance and off the back foot, too. There are also plenty of players who can set up their shots properly even with little time for preparation and can hit effective backhands with one hand even on fast surfaces (the most notable example is Roger Federer who can hit drives with his backhand on all surfaces with the same consistency as two handers). Stan Wawrinka is another example of a player who hits consistent one hand backhand drives on all types of surface with the same margin of error. The type of backhand a player uses comes down to mostly personal preference and their game style. Since the 1970s however, the two-handed backhand has had a spike in popularity and is now more widely taught than the one-handed backhand.\n\nMany tennis greats use the one-handed backhand. Such players include Roger Federer, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras, Justine Henin, Steffi Graf, Gustavo Kuerten, Amelie Mauresmo, Martina Navratilova, Stan Wawrinka, Don Budge, Ken Rosewall and Rod Laver.\n\nDespite there being many different variations and styles, in general there are three different techniques to hit the one-handed backhand. The first is the slice, the oldest version of the single-handed backhand, which was popularised by many classic players such as Ken Rosewall and was still used up until the 1980s even in the women's tour, with many great women champions such as Steffi Graf having one of the lowest, most effective slice backhands. The slice backhand is considered the most simple and is the easiest to learn technique-wise. However, it is much harder to master. Unlike the slice on its own, the slice backhand refers to a player continuously using slice on their backhand as an ordinary shot, instead of for variety. Most slice backhands are executed with a continental grip, identical to that of the backhand volley. The motion is also simple, and involves a cut at about 45 degrees to the bottom of the ball. The slice action closer to the bottom results in a higher and slower ball, typically used for lobs while a cut closer to the side of the ball results in a faster and lower ball. It is considered hard to be able to consistently pull off deep, low yet quick backhand slices and requires lots of practice and finesse. Such slice backhands often prevent opponents from getting under the ball easily and hitting easy winners. It also slows down the pace of the ball due to the back-spin on it, giving time for the player to anticipate and set up shots. For example, Steffi Graf often used her slice backhand to buy time for her to move around and hit inside-out forehands, her signature shot. It can also act as a good bluff to hit drop-shots or even fake drop-shots.\n\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, the flat single-handed backhand was popularised by many players, most famously Rod Laver and Don Budge. He was one of the first players to use a flat single-handed backhand with a hint of top-spin. Although flat or top-spin shots were not rare at the time, they were not common shots and were used mainly for variety only, especially on the backhand side. These shots were generally faster-paced, but were considered harder to learn and execute. Even today, there are still many players who use the flat single-handed backhand, such as Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, although they have added more top-spin to cope with top-spin from other players as well. However, by the 1980s, the flat single-handed backhand was the norm for most single-handed backhand players, with marquee players such as Stefan Edberg, John McEnroe and Pete Sampras using it to great effectiveness. The advantages of the flat single-handed backhand include its speed, the angles it can produce and its depth. It is usually executed with an Eastern or Semi-Western grip, and involves a \"throw-back\" in which the racket is pulled across the player's body, sometimes with the help of the left hand, and a release to hit the ball followed by a much larger follow-through and finish as compared to the slice backhand.\n\nWhile Björn Borg was considered to have had a two-handed backhand, he released his racket with one-hand, and was arguably the catalyst for the evolution and popularity of the two-handed backhand as well as the top-spin single-handed backhand. In the 1980s, when more players were using top-spin, single-handed backhand players found it more difficult to hit flat backhands due to the difficulty of neutralising the spin. Therefore, many players incorporated much more top-spin in their single-handed backhands, which was uncommon at that time. Up til today, many players who are considered to have some of the best single-handed backhands ever, such as Richard Gasquet, use a top-spin backhand. Other current players who use it include Nicolás Almagro and Grigor Dimitrov (Although he is also capable of hitting it flat). This helped single-handed backhand players cope with high spinning balls. The advantages of the top-spin single-handed backhand include consistency, placement, the angles it can produce as well as its ability to cope with high balls. Single-backhand \"flicks\" also evolved due to the popularisation of the top-spin single-handed backhand. Unlike the flat single-handed backhand, top-spin single-handed backhands are almost always performed with the Semi-Western or even Western Grip. Richard Gasquet, who is considered to have one of the most elegant and efficient single-handed backhands, is known for his long, winding action on his backhand and his elegant follow-through. The top-spin single-handed backhand is probably the hardest to learn. It involves the player employing a Semi-Western or Western grip, and winding the racket around his body and, most importantly, bring it lower than the ball. Then, he has to hit the ball at the middle to bottom of the ball while winding his hand upwards and front of him, in a \"window-wiper\" action. A mistake that is often made in this execution is not bringing the racket low enough or not having a follow-through.\n\nMany great players employ a combination of two or even three different styles. For example, Stan Wawrinka, who is said to have one of the most powerful single-handed backhands ever, can hit extremely flat backhands, but can also apply top-spin to them. Stefan Edberg in the past, along with Roger Federer and Grigor Dimitrov are able to apply all three, using the slice, flat and top-spin backhands effectively. This variety makes it hard for the opponent to guess what kind of shot they are going to play.\n\nThe player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, amateur and professional champion Don Budge, had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and '40s that imparted topspin onto the ball. He used an Eastern grip, and some pictures show his thumb extended along the side of the racquet for greater support. Ken Rosewall, another amateur and professional champion noted for his one-handed backhand, also used a continental grip to hit a deadly accurate slice backhand with underspin throughout the 1950s and '60s. Connoisseurs of the game also rate Swede Henrik Sundström's one-handed backhand as technically magnificent and as powerful as many forehands, but Sundström's career was cut short by injury.\n\nIn his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \"BACKHAND—Budge was best, with Kovacs, Rosewall and Connors in the next rank (although, as I've said, Connors' 'backhand' is really a two-handed forehand). Just in passing, the strangest competitive stroke was the backhand that belonged to Budge Patty. It was a weak shot, a little chip. But suddenly on match point, Patty had a fine, firm backhand. He was a helluva match player.\"\n\nOn the men's pro tour, dramatic changes have occurred since then. In the 1980s, many great players such as Stefan Edberg, Ivan Lendl, Henrik Sundström and John McEnroe were leading the charge with their one-handed versatile backhands. \nBut a new wave of players, such as Jimmy Connors, Björn Borg and Mats Wilander, started to show the world that two-handed backhands could also offer major advantages. Players could now increase the speed and control of their two-hander in key defensive shots, such as returns, passing shots and lobs. \nSince then, many players followed this trend. Among the main ones are Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Sergi Bruguera, Marat Safin, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, David Nalbandian (owning the fastest recorded backhand at 110 mph (171 km/h)), Nikolay Davydenko, Lleyton Hewitt, Daniil Medvedev, and Gilles Simon.\nHowever, the one-handed backhand is still used effectively by a few players like Roger Federer, Richard Gasquet, Stan Wawrinka, Dominic Thiem, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Mikhail Youzhny, Tommy Haas, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Grigor Dimitrov. \nOn the women's tour, Justine Henin's backhand was considered on par with the men's, with John McEnroe saying \"Justine Henin has the best single-handed backhand in both the men's and women's game. Henin's backhand is described as a deadly weapon which is spontaneous, accurate and powerful. She can hit drop shots with her deadly back hand.\"\nMany different styles of backhand arose in the late 1980s, including Steffi Graf's exceptional sliced backhand, and Monica Seles' two-handed backhand, characterized by its rapidity of execution. \nThe two-handed backhand began to gain popularity over the one-handed backhand in the 1990s (even though there had been great tennis champions whose backhand was two-handed, Chris Evert being an example). Some of the greatest two-handed backhands of the modern game include Serena Williams, Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, Lindsay Davenport, Jelena Janković, Li Na, Caroline Wozniacki, Victoria Azarenka, Simona Halep and Jeļena Ostapenko. The Williams sisters and Sharapova possess double-handed backhands that are considered the best and most powerful on tour. They can damage their opponents from any corner of the court with their backhands, being able to create angles that are much more difficult to create with a one-handed backhand. Other female players are known for their use of the slice backhand. Female players known for their proficiency with this shot include Billie Jean King, Margaret Court, Virginia Wade, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Jana Novotná, Nathalie Tauziat, Justine Henin, Amélie Mauresmo, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Samantha Stosur, Francesca Schiavone, Sara Errani, Roberta Vinci, Carla Suárez Navarro, Agnieszka Radwańska, Monica Niculescu, Caroline Garcia, Anastasija Sevastova, Ashleigh Barty and Bianca Andreescu.\n\nSome of the greatest rivalries in tennis history are symbolized by two different backhand styles. These include the Evert–Navratilova rivalry of the 1980's with Martina Navratilova's smooth one-handed sliced backhand versus Chris Evert's perfectly controlled two-handed backhand, Borg-McEnroe rivalry of the same period featuring Bjorn Borg's two-handed backhand against John McEnroe's one-handed backhand, and the contemporary Federer-Nadal rivalry with Roger Federer's effortless one-handed backhand with a lot of topspin or backspin, versus Rafael Nadal's powerful, flatter two-handed backhand.\n\n"}

{"id": "2066952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066952", "title": "WWE Draft", "text": "WWE Draft\n\nThe WWE Draft, called the WWE Superstar Shake-up from 2017 to May 2019, is a process used by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE to refresh its rosters between the Raw and SmackDown brands (2002–2011; 2016–present). WWE's former ECW brand also took part (2006–2009) during the first brand split until that brand was disbanded in early 2010. With the second brand split in 2016, wrestlers from NXT (2016–present) and 205 Live (2019–present) are also eligible to be drafted to Raw and SmackDown.\n\nThe draft was first used during the brand split of 2002. It has been called the WWE Draft Lottery (2004–2005) and later simply as the \"Draft\" (2007–2011). In 2011, WWE ended the brand split. With \"SmackDown\" moving to Tuesdays and to a live broadcast starting July 19, 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand split with a draft held that same episode. From 2017 until May 2019, the draft was rebranded as the Superstar Shake-up; instead of a traditional draft, wrestlers were traded or moved between the brands with decisions made behind the scenes. With \"SmackDown\"s move to Friday nights on FOX beginning October 4, 2019, a second draft for the year was scheduled to occur, reverting to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and returning to a traditional draft format.\n\nIn 2002, the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) introduced the brand split, dividing its roster among two brands, Raw and SmackDown, represented by the shows of the same name. Only Undisputed Champion Triple H and Women's Champion Jazz were ineligible to be drafted, as the holders of those titles defended them on both brands; the other champions, however, could be drafted.\n\nThe first half of the draft was televised live on TNN for two hours, as part of the WWF's flagship program, \"Monday Night Raw\". The second half was conducted over the Internet on the WWF's website. There were thirty draft picks, with sixty wrestlers drafted overall by co-owners of the WWF, onto their respective brands, Raw and SmackDown. The remaining wrestlers were divided randomly in a draft lottery, with each brand receiving a grand total of thirty wrestlers. During the draft, Raw drafted Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam and European Champion William Regal, while SmackDown drafted Tag Team Champions Billy and Chuck, Cruiserweight Champion Tajiri, and Hardcore Champion Maven, though the Tag Team Championship, renamed to World Tag Team Championship, and Hardcore Championship switched to Raw after the titles were won by Raw's The Un-Americans (Christian and Lance Storm) and Raven, respectively. Two months after the draft, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). In July and August, respectively, the European and Hardcore titles were unified into the Intercontinental title. In September, the Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and renamed to WWE Championship after reigning champion Brock Lesnar signed an exclusive deal with the brand. In response, Raw established the World Heavyweight Championship as the counterpart to the WWE Championship. The Women's Championship also became exclusive to Raw with no SmackDown counterpart. SmackDown then established the WWE Tag Team Championship as the counterpart to the World Tag Team Championship, and in July 2003, they revived the United States Championship as the counterpart to the Intercontinental title.\n\nThe second draft took place in 2004 on \"Raw\" on Spike TV. Post-draft trades were revealed on WWE's website, until midnight on March 22, 2004. There were twelve draft picks, with nineteen wrestlers overall switching between the promotion's two brands. During the draft lottery, the General manager of Raw, Eric Bischoff, and the General manager of SmackDown!, Paul Heyman, stood on opposite ends of the stage on the Raw set, where they drafted six wrestlers randomly via two machines. At the conclusion of the draft, the two GMs would then be allowed to trade anyone on the roster until Midnight EST, which was later extended until Tuesday night after Heyman resigned. Every on-screen WWE employee was eligible to be drafted, including injured wrestlers, commentators, champions, and general managers.\n\nThe 2005 draft took place on WWE's two television programs, \"Raw\", which aired on Spike TV, and \"SmackDown!\", which aired on UPN. Post-draft trades were announced on WWE's website. The draft picks were made each Monday on \"Raw\" and each Thursday on \"SmackDown!\" from June 6 to June 30. Each pick was drafted at random. Like the previous year, all on-screen WWE personnel were eligible to be drafted. There were ten draft picks and an eleven-person trade conducted between the promotion's two brands; twenty-two wrestlers were drafted and traded overall. During the draft, WWE Champion John Cena was drafted to Raw and kept his championship. General Manager Theodore Long considered creating a new SmackDown world championship but the idea was abandoned when World Heavyweight Champion Batista was drafted to SmackDown, bringing the title with him.\n\nThere was no Raw and SmackDown draft in 2006, however, ECW became a third brand. ECW representative Paul Heyman received two total draft picks from the existing SmackDown and Raw rosters for the newly created ECW brand, which shortly after revived the ECW World Heavyweight Championship as the brand's only title.\n\nThe first half of the 2007 draft was televised live on \"Raw\" on USA Network, while the second half, the supplemental draft, was conducted on June 17, 2007 on WWE's website for four hours as draft picks were revealed at twenty-minute intervals. There were twenty-three draft picks, with twenty-seven wrestlers drafted overall, between the promotion's three brands: Raw, SmackDown, and ECW. For the televised half of the draft, each brand's draft pick was determined by nine matches, one being a battle royal for two draft picks, where wrestlers from their respective brands wrestled to earn a draft pick. The supplemental draft, however, was conducted randomly, with each brand receiving random draft selections. Raw and SmackDown! received five random draft picks, while ECW received three random draft picks. The televised draft picks were randomly selected by a computer that was shown on the Raw titantron. Every WWE wrestler from Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW was eligible to be drafted. ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley was stripped of the title after being drafted to Raw. The Cruiserweight Championship was also retired later that year.\n\nDuring the 2008 draft, broadcast live on \"Raw\", United States Champion Matt Hardy was drafted to ECW, while WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to SmackDown, and ECW Champion Kane was drafted to Raw. The World Heavyweight Championship moved to Raw after Raw's CM Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Edge to win the title on an episode of \"Raw\", the ECW Championship moved back to ECW after ECW's Mark Henry won the title at Night of Champions, and the United States Championship moved back to SmackDown after SmackDown's Shelton Benjamin defeated Hardy to win the title. Every on-screen WWE employee was eligible to be drafted. Similar to the 2007 draft, wrestlers from each brand competed in matches to win a random draft pick for their brand. Draft picks were kayfabe selected at random via a computer that was shown on the titantron. Like the previous year, a supplemental draft took place on June 25, in which draft selections were randomly conducted. Also in 2008, SmackDown established the WWE Divas Championship as the counterpart to the Women's Championship on Raw.\n\nThe 2009 draft took place over two days: the first day was televised live on the April 13 episode of \"Raw\" from Atlanta, Georgia, while the supplemental draft was held on April 13 on WWE's website. Wrestlers, general managers, and commentators were all eligible to be drafted from the company's roster. For the televised half, matches determined which brand received a random draft selection. During the supplemental draft, brand and employee selections were made at random. Overall, 36 draft selections were made. Twelve selections were made on television, six by Raw, five by SmackDown, and one by ECW. All of the draftees were wrestlers: 28 males (10 drafted on television) and 8 females (2 drafted on television). Just prior to the 2009 draft at WrestleMania XXV, The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) unified the World Tag Team and WWE Tag Team Championships as the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, though the titles remained independently active. Unified WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns, Divas Champion Maryse, United States Champion MVP, and WWE Champion Triple H were drafted to Raw, while Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio were drafted to SmackDown. The World Heavyweight Championship moved to SmackDown after SmackDown's Edge defeated John Cena for the title at Backlash.\n\nThe 2010 draft took place over two days: the first day was televised live on April 26 on \"Raw\" at Richmond Coliseum in Richmond, Virginia, and the second part, the supplemental draft, was held on April 27 on WWE's website. As the ECW brand had been disbanded two months earlier, deactivating the ECW Championship along with it, the draft was once again only between Raw and SmackDown. Unified WWE Tag Team Champions The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith) were drafted to Raw. Later that year, the World Tag Team Championship was formally decommissioned in favor of continuing the WWE Tag Team Championship, which dropped \"Unified\" from its name, and the Women's and Divas Championships were unified, retiring the Women's title and continuing the Divas title, which briefly became known as the Unified WWE Divas Championship. The WWE Tag Team Championship and Divas Championship both became unbranded, allowing the holders to defend the titles on both shows.\n\nDuring the 2011 draft, United States Champion Sheamus was drafted to SmackDown, however, he lost to the title to Raw's Kofi Kingston the following month, moving the title back to Raw. The draft aired live on \"Raw\", for two hours in Raleigh, North Carolina from the RBC Center. As a standard for previous drafts, most on-air personnel were eligible to be drafted. A continuation of the draft took place on WWE's official website at 12:00pm Eastern time on the following afternoon. SmackDown received 16 additional members to its roster while Raw received 13. For the first time in draft history, two of the draft picks consisted of the same wrestler (John Cena) being selected to SmackDown with the first pick and back to Raw with the last televised pick. This was the last draft of the first brand split as the WWE ended the brand split in August 2011, with all on-screen personnel appearing on both shows.\n\nIn early 2012, WWE established a developmental brand called NXT with its own set of championships. The following year in December, the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship were unified, retiring the World Heavyweight Championship and continuing the WWE Championship, which became known as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship until mid-2016, when it was renamed back to WWE Championship. The Divas Championship was also retired in early 2016 and replaced by a new WWE Women's Championship.\n\nWith the return of the brand split in 2016, the draft was reintroduced and occurred on July 19 on \"SmackDown Live\" – the live premiere of \"SmackDown\", which was previously taped (also the debut of \"SmackDown\" on the USA Network). With the exception of NXT champions, wrestlers from the NXT brand were eligible to be drafted, as well as on-screen WWE employees. Tag teams counted as one pick unless a brand specifically only wanted a single member of the team. For every two draft picks by SmackDown, Raw received three (due to \"Raw\" being a three-hour show while \"SmackDown\" was only two hours). SmackDown drafted WWE Champion Dean Ambrose and Intercontinental Champion The Miz (along with his wife Maryse), while Raw drafted WWE Women's Champion Charlotte, United States Champion Rusev (along with his wife Lana), and WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods), among others. New titles were introduced. Raw established the WWE Universal Championship to be the counterpart to the WWE Championship. The WWE Women's Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship were renamed to Raw Women's Championship and Raw Tag Team Championship, respectively, while SmackDown introduced the SmackDown Women's Championship and SmackDown Tag Team Championship as counterparts. A new WWE Cruiserweight Championship was later introduced for the revived cruiserweight division on Raw.\n\nIn the following years, the draft was revamped as the Superstar Shake-up, in which changes between the brands were made behind the scenes, with moving wrestlers simply appearing on a brand's show or announced via WWE's website or social medias. The 2017 Superstar Shake-up occurred on the April 10 and 11 episodes of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", respectively. Raw drafted Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose and SmackDown drafted United States Champion Kevin Owens; Owens then lost the title to Raw's Chris Jericho, but instead of the title switching brands, Jericho moved to SmackDown. On-screen WWE employees were eligible to be drafted. Although wrestlers from NXT debuted on Raw and SmackDown during the 2017 Shake-up, these were not considered part of the Shake-up.<ref name=\"https://www.wwe.com/videos/date-revealed-for-the-2019-superstar-shake-up-wwe-now\"></ref>\n\nThe 2018 Superstar Shake-up occurred on the April 16 and 17 episodes of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", respectively. The United States Championship switched brands twice. On the April 16 episode of \"Raw\", reigning champion Jinder Mahal moved to the Raw brand and lost the title to Jeff Hardy that same night, who then took the title back to SmackDown as he moved to that brand the following night on \"SmackDown\". NXT wrestlers were also eligible to be drafted. Shortly after the 2018 Shake-up, 205 Live became its own separate brand from Raw and the Cruiserweight Championship became exclusive to 205 Live. NXT UK also became a brand later that year with its own set of championships. The WWE Women's Tag Team Championship was later established and shared between the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brands.\n\nThe 2019 Superstar Shake-up began on the April 15 and 16 episodes of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", respectively, with more draft moves confirmed over the next few weeks. SmackDown drafted Intercontinental Champion Finn Bálor while Raw drafted United States Champion Samoa Joe. NXT wrestlers were also eligible to be drafted and for the first time, wrestlers from the 205 Live brand were eligible. Reigning NXT Tag Team Champions The Viking Raiders (Ivar and Erik) were drafted to Raw, but the titles remained part of NXT; they subsequently relinquished the titles. Although not officially part of the 2019 Shake-up, Alexander Wolfe moved from SmackDown to NXT UK after his stable, Sanity, disbanded when stable leader Eric Young moved from SmackDown to Raw, while Tyler Breeze moved from Raw to NXT. A \"Wild Card Rule\" was introduced shortly after the Shake-up, allowing up to four wrestlers to appear on the opposing brand's show by invitation for one night only with unsanctioned appearances penalized with a fine or termination. However, the rule's stipulations were not enforced, making brand division between wrestlers unclear. Also introduced was a new championship, the WWE 24/7 Championship; shared across all of WWE's brands and open to anyone. The WWE Cruiserweight Championship also became shared with NXT and renamed to NXT Cruiserweight Championship.\n\nWith \"SmackDown\"s move to Friday nights on FOX in October 2019 – and the show once again renamed to \"Friday Night SmackDown\" – a second draft for 2019 was scheduled to definitively split the main roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands. Returning to its original name (the WWE Draft) and a traditional draft format, the 2019 WWE Draft occurred on the October 11 and 14 episodes of \"SmackDown\" and \"Raw\", respectively. Personalities from FOX and USA Network appeared and were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions (the first time that the brand's television networks had an influence). Several celebrities from both networks also appeared. Over 70 wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, 205 Live, and NXT rosters, as well as tag teams, were eligible to be drafted to Raw or SmackDown, including all champions (although the 24/7 Champion and Women's Tag Team Champions were eligible to be drafted, they still defend their respective titles across the brands). Just like the 2016 draft, tag teams counted as one pick unless a brand specifically only wanted a single member of the team, and for every two draft picks made by SmackDown, Raw received three (as \"Raw\" is three hours and \"SmackDown\" is two). Most draft picks were announced on the live broadcasts of \"SmackDown\" and \"Raw\", while supplemental picks were announced afterwards via WWE's website. Wrestlers who were not drafted to either brand became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing. Raw made 38 picks, while SmackDown made 30. The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.\n\n! No.\n! Year\n! Date(s)\n! Brands\n\n"}

Located on the northern tip of the Macau Peninsula, it is known by the Barrier Gate separating Macau from mainland China. The Portuguese built the gate in 1849 to replace a crumbling wall that the Chinese erected during the Ming dynasty in 1573. The Chinese built a garrisoned wall to control the flow of people and goods. It was the site of the Passaleão incident, a clash between the Qing dynasty and the Kingdom of Portugal in 1849 over the death of Macau's governor Ferreira do Amaral. Led by Colonel Mesquita, Portugal won the small battle which led to the extension of Macau's border northwards. At the limit of said expansion, the Portas do Cerco was built with the inscription \"A pátria honrai, que a pátria vos contempla\" (Portuguese for \"Honor your motherland, for your motherland looks over you\") on the façade on its inner arch in 1849. The Barrier Gate served as a \"de facto\" boundary, but the precise limits of Macau's border has never been formally demarcated.\n\nMacau, now a special administrative region of China, still has an official border with Zhuhai in mainland China a few meters behind the old barrier gate. The new Posto Fronteiriço das Portas do Cerco (\"border gate border building\") was opened on 15 January 2004.\n\nThe first formalised border crossing was built in 1573, which was subsequently repaired and rebuilt several times until the present border gate was erected in 1870. It was the site of the Battle of the Barrier between British and Chinese forces on 19 August 1840.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s the Portas do Cerco was also referred to as \"Far Eastern Checkpoint Charlie\" with a major border incident happening in 1952 with Portuguese African Troops exchanging fire with Chinese Communist border guards. According to reports, the exchange lasted for one and three quarter hours leaving one dead and several dozens injured on Macau side and more than 100 casualties claimed on the Communist Chinese side.\n\nTransmac\nTCM\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2066968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066968", "title": "Choir dress", "text": "Choir dress\n\nChoir dress is the traditional vesture of the clerics, seminarians and religious of Christian churches worn for public prayer and the administration of the sacraments except when celebrating or concelebrating the Eucharist. It differs from the vestments worn by the celebrants of the Eucharist, being normally made of fabrics such as wool, cotton or silk, as opposed to the fine brocades used in vestments. It may also be worn by lay assistants such as acolytes and choirs. It was abandoned by most of the Churches which originated in the sixteenth-century Reformation.\n\nLike Eucharistic vestments it derived originally from the formal secular dress of the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian era which survived in church usage after fashion had changed.\n\nChoir dress also differs from \"house dress\" which is worn outside of a liturgical context (whether in the house or on the street). House dress may be either formal or informal.\n\nChoir dress in the Catholic Church is worn by deacons, priests, regular prelates, bishops and cardinals when presiding at or celebrating a liturgy that is not the Mass, especially the Liturgy of the Hours.\nBefore the Second Vatican Council the dress was more elaborate, and had dozens of varieties and colours. After The Second Vatican Council, it was reduced, however exceptions are sometimes granted for cathedral chapters.\n\nThe current dress is worn when attending Mass without celebrating or observing the Eucharist. It is worn by seminarians, instituted lectors and acolytes, and altar servers and choir members at Mass or other liturgical events.\n\nThe basic components of choir dress are:\n\nFor seminarians, deacons, and priests the cassock is exactly the same as their normal cassock: a black cassock with black buttons, girded with a black fascia.\n\nPriests who hold additional honors may wear a different cassock: Chaplains of His Holiness wear a black cassock with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while Honorary Prelates and Protonotaries apostolic wear a purple cassock with scarlet piping and buttons with a purple fascia. A black cassock with amaranth piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress (academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic. Canons may wear the rochet (if the chapter has been granted usus rochetti by papal indult) with a distinctive mozzetta, the particular colors of which are determined by the chapter.\n\nBishops wear the above-mentioned purple cassock with scarlet piping, and add a pectoral cross suspended from a green and gold cord, a mozzetta over the rochet, and a purple zucchetto under the biretta. A cardinal wears a scarlet cassock with scarlet trim, pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the rochet, with a red zucchetto. The Pope's choir dress includes a white cassock, rochet, red silk mozetta, red brocade stole and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.\n\nThe cope and/or stole may be worn over choir dress when a cleric presides over a sacrament (for instance, at matrimony, if not celebrated during Mass), or by the cleric presiding over prayers (for instance, the priest presiding at a solemn celebration of Vespers in the Liturgy of the Hours might wear cope and stole over choir dress, while other clergy present would wear simple choir dress of cassock and surplice).\n\nMonks who are neither deacons nor priests also have a form of choir dress: the full monastic habit with the monastic cowl forms their formal wear for attending the Liturgy of the Hours or Mass.\n\nSince 2006, priests of the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest have had their own choir dress, given to them by the Cardinal Archbishop of Florence. Their choir dress includes a rochet, a mozzetta, the cross of St. Francis de Sales on a blue and white ribbon, and a biretta with a blue pom. According to the Institute, \"The blue stands for our complete dedication to the Blessed Mother and is traditionally the color shown on St. Francis de Sales in most paintings of him,\" and \"The choir dress expresses the strong unity, spiritually, and identity of the Institute and adds solemnity to the liturgy.\"\n\nThe choir dress of clergy in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches are relatively similar. Over the inner cassock (\"rasson\" or \"podrasnik\"), a deep-sleeved \"exorason\" (\"riassa\"), which is often black, is worn. In the Russian Orthodox Church, married clergy often wear grey, while monastic clergy wear black. During the paschal season both monastic and married clergy will often wear a white inner cassock. Some Russian Metropolitans wear a white inner cassock and a blue outer when formally arriving to celebrate the Divine Liturgy.\n\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine Catholicism, monks wear a black cloak, the \"mandyas\" over the outer cassock. The mandyas completely covers the monastic below the chin and reaches to the floor. In the Greek usage, the mandyas is usually only worn when performing certain liturgical roles; in the Slavic usage, all monks and nuns of the rank of Stavrophore or above wear the mandyas at every service, so long as they are in their own monastery. The mandyas of an hegumen (abbot) is of black silk, that of an archimandrite or bishop is of colored silk (specific usages will differ by jurisdiction), and has four square \"tablets\" on it: two at the neck and two at the feet. A bishop's mandyas additionally has \"rivers\" on it: three horizontal stripes either of gold (Greek practice) or red and white (Slavic practice).\n\nMonastic clergy wear different headcoverings than married clergy. Married clergy wear either a colored \"kalimaukion\" or \"skufia\"; monastic clergy wear a black kalimaukion and veil (together known as the \"klobuk\"). For monastics, the skufia is reserved for house dress, and the klobuk is worn in church. Russian archbishops have a jewelled cross attached to the front of their klobuks; Russian Metropolitans wear a white klobuk with jewelled cross. Several Orthodox Patriarchs wear a rounded headcovering called a koukoulion.\n\nPriests who have been awarded a pectoral cross wear it with their choir dress (these pectoral crosses are of several degrees: silver, gold, or jewelled). Bishops wear a \"panagia\" (icon of the Theotokos) in place of the pectoral cross. Archbishops may wear a pectoral cross and a panagia. All primates and some bishops below primatial rank have the dignity of wearing an \"enkolpion\" (icon of Christ), a pectoral cross, and a panagia.\n\nA ruling Igumen (so long as he is inside his own monastery) and a bishop may carry his \"paterissa\" (crozier) when he is in church. However, the paterissa is never to be carried inside the sanctuary; instead, when he goes into the altar, the paterissa is either handed to an altar server or left leaning against the iconostasis outside the Holy Doors.\n\nIn North America and Great Britain, some Orthodox clergy have begun to wear a Roman collar (clergy shirt), though this is discouraged among the more traditional Orthodox.\n\nThere exist color and design variations in each autocephalous Church, but these diagrams give some examples of Eastern Orthodox choir dress vestments:\n\nIn the Syriac Orthodox Church, married priests wear a black skullcap, or \"phiro\", while monastic priests wear the schema, \"eskimo\". For certain sacramental functions, a priest or bishop puts on the epitrachelion (stole).\n\n\"Choir dress\" in Anglicanism traditionally consists of cassock, surplice and scarf (or tippet). An academic hood may also be worn and, since 1964 in the Church of England a cope may be worn at the discretion of the minister. However, the basic garment was, and is, the surplice which by the fourteenth century had become the essential choir-vestment everywhere. The surplice was the only vesture permitted to the clergy in the 1552 Prayer Book, except for bishops who should use a rochet (both wore cassocks as the standard undergarment). The Elizabethan Prayer Book of 1559 included the so-called Ornaments Rubric. Its legal interpretation was disputed in the nineteenth century it was claimed that its inclusion in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer commanded the pre-Reformation Eucharistic vestments (chasuble, dalmatic, tunicle, alb, amice, and maniple) that had been in use during the reign of Edward VI. However, the Elizabethan bishops struggled to enforce the use of the surplice, and the use of Eucharistic vestments was discontinued until after the Oxford Movement, in the middle of the nineteenth century, when it was restored in many cathedrals and parish churches. In many low-church dioceses and parishes the choir dress continued to be the norm, even at the Eucharist. The cope nevertheless continued in use for coronations and in certain cathedrals, but this may be considered an extension of \"choir dress\" and was sanctioned by the canons of 1603/4.\n\nThe cassock is almost invariably black for priests and deacons. A traditional Anglican cassock is double-breasted, being buttoned on the shoulder rather than up the front (there may be a single button sewn to the center of the chest used to fasten the academic hood if worn). Many Anglican clergy, especially (though not exclusively) those within the catholic tradition of Anglicanism, prefer to wear the Latin single-breasted cassock. The cassock is worn with a cincture, which may take the form of a cloth sash resembling a fascia, or a simple rope girdle or leather belt. Over this is worn the surplice, which is longer and fuller than that worn by Roman Catholic clergy, sometimes reaching well below the knees. Traditionally, an academic hood is worn around the shoulders and down the back, along with a black tippet or scarf worn around the nape and hanging straight down in front. The hood and tippet were once a single garment called an almuce. (The tippet is not to be confused with the stole, which is also worn in a similar manner, but is not part of choir dress, being worn at the Eucharist and other sacramental services.) Some clergy also wear Geneva bands (or \"preaching tabs\") from their collars. Though not worn at service-time, the Canterbury cap is the traditional headgear of Church of England clergy; some prefer the biretta (see below) or mortar board. Neither is widely worn, although a square cap, with cassock, gown and tippet, was specified in English canon law as part of the \"outdoor habit\" or \"house dress\" of the clergy until the promulgation of new canons in the 1960s. At some periods of history a black gown, either academic or 'Genevan', was worn for Morning and Evening Prayer instead of the surplice which was reserved for use at the Holy Communion - the cassock, bands, gown, academic hood and tippet still being the normal liturgical costume for ordained minister of the Church of Scotland and other Reformed and Presbyterian churches.\n\nChaplains in the Armed Forces wear tippets with officially sanctioned badges and any medals they have achieved. A bishop or priest may wear a tippet with the arms of the seminary from which he or she received their degree. In England some cathedral clergy wear tippets on which is embroidered the distinctive symbol or cathedral coat of arms. Members of the high church or Anglo-Catholic parts of the church sometimes wear choir dress of a more Roman Catholic style, including a shorter surplice (or \"cotta\"), a stole (and sometimes a biretta), excluding hood and tippet.\n\nReaders when officiating often wear a blue tippet, or, in the United States, a black tippet displaying the arms of the diocese. At the Eucharist, it may be more fitting for readers of Scripture to wear street clothing to emphasize the role of the laity in recent versions of the Prayer Book. However, in some parishes readers wear the traditional vestments of the subdeacon at High Mass: alb fastened with a white cincture and a tunicle. In other parishes they wear the cassock and surplice, as do members of the choir.\n\nAnglican bishops usually wear a purple cassock. Over this, instead of the surplice, they wear the rochet with red or black chimere and matching cuffs, black tippet, and sometimes an academic hood.\n\n"}

His mother was the widow of James Tweedie of Drumelzier, and the third daughter of Sir James Douglas of Drumlanrig.\n\nHis paternal grandfather was Sir Walter Ker of Cessford (died ), who fought against Mary, Queen of Scots, both at Carberry Hill and at Langside.\n\nHe was knighted on 17 May 1590 at the coronation of Anne of Denmark. In December 1590 he was involved in the assassination of William Kerr of Ancram who was ambushed on the stairs at the entry to his lodging by two of Robert's followers who shot him with a pistol called a \"dag\".\n\nKer was Deputy Keeper of Liddesdale and Warden of the Middle March in 1593. In August 1594 he performed in the tournament at the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle dressed as a Turkish knight.\n\nHe helped James VI against Bothwell, was a member of the Privy Council of Scotland from 1599, and was created Lord Roxburghe in 1600. \n\nIn April 1601 Roxburghe invited James VI and his consort Anne of Denmark to the celebration of the marriage of his sister Elizabeth to Sir John Bellenden of Broughton at Floors Castle, but the king refused, suspecting a plot involving the Master of Gray.\n\nIn September 1602, he visited Elizabeth I of England. Sir Robert Cecil wrote that he was \"of as wise and gallant fashion as I have seen out of Scotland a great while.\" He accompanied King James to London in 1603. Ker succeeded to his father's estates in 1606 and in 1607, he was a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. \n\nOn 18 September 1616, he was created Lord Ker of Cessford and Caverton, and Earl of Roxburghe with remainder to his heirs male.\n\nHe offended decorum at court in April 1625, when the body of King James was bought from Theobalds it was noticed that the Earls of Morton and Roxburghe were not in attendance, but went to be \"merry\" at More Park with Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford.\n\nHe was appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland in 1637.\n\nHe subscribed to the King's Covenant at Holyrood in 1638, and joined the King's party in the civil war. When the King attempted to arrest five members of the House of Commons in 1642, Ker kept the door of the chamber open (see article on William Lenthall). He supported the \"Engagement\" for the King's rescue in 1648, and was consequently deprived of his office as Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1649.\n\nThe Earl of Roxburghe married three times. His first marriage was on 27 October 1587 to Margaret Maitland (died by 1613), the only daughter of William Maitland of Lethington and Mary Fleming who was one of the \"Four Maries\", the devoted companions of the Queen of the Scots. They were the parents of:\n\n\nOn 3 February 1613/14, he married Jean Drummond (–1643), the sister of his son-in-law and the third daughter of Patrick Drummond, 3rd Lord Drummond and Lady Elizabeth Lindsay (daughter of David Lindsay, 9th Earl of Crawford). Their son was Harry Ker, styled Lord Ker (d. 1642/3), who married Lady Margaret Hay, only daughter of William Hay, 10th Earl of Erroll and Lady Anne Lyon (eldest daughter of Patrick Lyon, 1st Earl of Kinghorne). After his death, his widow married John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis.\n\nAfter his second wife's death in 1643, he married Lady Isobel Douglas, fifth daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton, by his wife Lady Anne Keith (eldest daughter of George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal).\n\nHe died at Floors, his residence near Kelso, on 18 January 1650. After his death, his widow married James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose and became the mother of James Graham, 3rd Marquess of Montrose.\n\nAs both of his sons predeceased him without male issue of their own, his titles and estates passed by special arrangement to his grandson, William Drummond (1622–1675), the youngest son of his eldest daughter Jean and her husband John Drummond, 2nd Earl of Perth.

Considerable information is available from commercial sources about this salt.\n\nAccording to an April 2005 \"Nature\" article, Brian Naranjo, Jim Gimzewski and Seth Putterman at UCLA applied a large temperature difference to a lithium tantalate crystal producing a large enough charge to generate and accelerate a beam of deuterium nuclei into a deuteriated target resulting in the production of a small flux of helium-3 and neutrons through nuclear fusion without extreme heat or pressure. Their results have been replicated.\n\nIt is unlikely to be useful for electricity generation since the energy required to produce the fusion reactions exceeded the energy produced by them. It is thought that the technique might be useful for small neutron generators, especially if the deuterium beam is replaced by a tritium one. Comparing this with the electrostatic containment of ionic plasma to achieve fusion in a \"fusor\" or other IEC, this method focuses electrical acceleration to a much smaller non-ionized deuterium target without heat.\n\nA scientific paper published in February 2010 shows a difference in the temperature and mechanism of freezing water to ice, depending on the charge applied to a surface of pyroelectric LiTaO crystals.\n\n"}

It is the southernmost stop in New Jersey on the Northeast Corridor. It is the terminus for NJ Transit trains to and from New York City and SEPTA Trenton Line Regional Rail trains to and from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and an intermediate station for Amtrak trains traveling between the two cities along the Northeast Corridor.\n\nThe northern terminus of the River Line light rail system, which offers service to Camden along the Delaware River, is across Clinton Avenue from the main station building.\n\nBus service at the station consists of local NJ Transit routes, including Capital Connection buses, serving the New Jersey Capitol Complex, and regional service to Philadelphia via Camden. In addition, the station serves as the northern terminus for SEPTA buses to Oxford Valley Mall. Greyhound bus service to the station was previously available but has been discontinued.\n\nTrenton is the only city in New Jersey to serve three major railway systems in the state (Amtrak, NJ Transit, and SEPTA).\n\nTrenton Transit Center has two levels; the upper level with ticket offices, ticket machines, a Dunkin' Donuts and newsstand, the Pizza Grill, a snack kiosk, two sets of restrooms, a bank branch, an Auntie Anne's pretzel shop, and a McDonald's restaurant. The upper level of the station also crosses Assunpink Creek. From the upper level, stairs and elevators lead down to the two island platforms for the trains. The eastbound island platform (Tracks 1 & 2) also has a newsstand/snack kiosk as well as NJT ticket machines. \n\nUnlike most large Amtrak stations along the Northeast Corridor, there is no checked baggage service.\n\nA $56.6 million renovation is currently underway, which will include an addition of a mezzanine level providing additional office and retail space. New lighting, air-conditioning, information displays, escalators, and elevators will also be installed. Construction is anticipated to last two years.\n\nAcross the street is the River Line light rail station that connects to Camden.\n\nRail service in Trenton dates back to the days of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, which built a station on East Street in 1837, until it was moved to the current site in 1863. The C&A was merged into the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company in 1867 and acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1893, which replaced the station the same year. As with many Pennsylvania Railroad stations, especially in New Jersey, the station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central & Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Amtrak took over intercity railroad service in 1971, but Penn Central continued to serve commuters, even as it was reduced to little more than a platform in 1972. In 1976, the bankrupt Penn Central built the new Trenton Rail Station just before its rail assets were taken over by Conrail. By 1983, the station became part of NJ Transit Rail Operations, but also continued to serve Amtrak as well as SEPTA Regional Rail to Philadelphia. From 2006-2008, a major reconstruction project authorized by NJT took place with $46 million worth of federal aid, and $33 million worth of state funding that resulted in the replacement with the current Trenton Transit Center.\n\nTrenton Transit Center consists of a station building, four boarding locations, and a separate station for the River Line. The River Line terminal is across Clinton Avenue from the station building at street level, one story above the Northeast Corridor tracks. The River Line station consists of two low-level side platforms and two tracks that end in bumper blocks. These two tracks cross over the Northeast Corridor and then bend southwards towards the river, where they head towards Camden.\n\nBeing the terminus for NJ Transit Northeast Corridor Line service and the last stop for Amtrak and SEPTA in New Jersey, Trenton is central Jersey's largest station facility, with the ability to load five trains across seven operational tracks at any given time. NJ Transit trains that terminate in Trenton discharge passengers and continue on a two-mile haul to the Morrisville Yard in Pennsylvania. SEPTA trains either remain idle at the station platform or park on a special siding on the northern side of the station reserved for these trainsets. There are two express tracks – one in each direction – that can be used for trains running express from Philadelphia's 30th Street Station to Penn Station in Newark. The line narrows to four tracks for the majority of its length east and west of the station. To the west, all trains traverse the Delaware River via the Morrisville–Trenton Railroad Bridge, entering Pennsylvania, at which point two tracks separate from the main line towards NJT's Morrisville Yard.\nBeing a major station along the Northeast Corridor, Trenton boards and receives passengers through the use of two lengthy platforms (for day-to-day operations) that can accommodate up to four trains on separate tracks at once. Both platforms are high-level, enabling faster boarding and greater accessibility for handicapped passengers. All tracks are accessed from an overpass that connects the train terminal to the front of the station and with parking facilities on the station level. Tracks 1 and 2 share an island platform and handle all service northbound towards New York Penn Station. Tracks 4 and 5 share an island platform and handle all service from New York and to and from Pennsylvania. Track 3 has a low-level platform and is largely unused except if one particular track is out of service or in an emergency.\n\nOne of the unique features of the Trenton station is that inbound NJ Transit trains from New York release passengers on the same track reserved for SEPTA operations, deliberately allowing for an efficient transfer between the two rail lines for continued service to Philadelphia. As a result, the aft ends of both trains may not be able to open their doors, since they extend past the ends of the platforms with both trains stopped on the same track.\n\nAll tracks are electrified with overhead catenary wires, as is the entire Northeast Corridor from Washington Union Station to Boston South Station.\n\nNote: Shows platform layouts only, not the actual station layout.\n\n"}

However, thereafter, the Tang state was plagued by warlords such as Tian Chengsi, Li Baochen, and Liang Chongyi who essentially governed their realms as independent states while only pledging nominal loyalty to the emperor. This would prove disastrous for future generations as subsequent Tang emperors would be unable to remove or control these warlords and the central government's power was thus slowly eroded and diminished. The power of the warlords would not prevent the Tang western territories from being overrun by Tibetan invasions and eventually lost to the Tibetan Empire, which even managed to capture Chang'an in 763 for a short period before being expelled.\n\nEmperor Daizong was credited for removing the corrupt eunuch Li Fuguo, who had placed him on the throne, from power, but the rest of Emperor Daizong's reign would also see dominance by such individuals as the eunuchs Cheng Yuanzhen and Yu Chao'en, as well as the chancellor Yuan Zai. It is also worth noting that Emperor Daizong became the first Tang emperor to succeed to the throne as a result of maneuvers by eunuchs. Emperor Daizong was himself also said to be overly devout in Buddhism.\n\nDaizong's father, Li Jun, was the Prince of Zhong under his father Emperor Xuanzong when Daizong was born. His mother was Li Jun's concubine Consort Wu. He was the oldest of Emperor Xuanzong's over 100 grandsons. In 740, by which time Li Jun (whose name had been changed to Li Heng by that point) was crown prince, Li Chu was created the Prince of Guangping. That year, his mother Consort Wu died. In his youth, he was said to be kind, meek, and filially pious, and was studious, particularly in the \"Classic of Rites\" and the \"I Ching\". He was much favored by his grandfather. Emperor Xuanzong chose for him, as his wife and princess, Lady Cui the daughter of the Lady of Han, a sister of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Yang Yuhuan; however, his oldest son Li Kuo was born of a concubine, Consort Shen.\n\nIn 755, the general An Lushan rebelled at Fanyang (范陽, in modern Beijing), and by summer 756, the forces of his new state of Yan were approaching the Tang capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee to Chengdu. When Emperor Xuanzong's train reached Mawei Station (馬嵬驛, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), angry soldiers, blaming the rebellion on the chancellor Yang Guozhong (Consort Yang's cousin), killed Yang Guozhong and his family members and forced Emperor Xuanzong to kill Consort Yang. Subsequently, the people in the Mawei region tried to persuade Emperor Xuanzong not to continue on to Chengdu—believing that Chang'an could be recaptured. Emperor Xuanzong asked Li Heng to try to comfort the people. Once Li Heng left Emperor Xuanzong's presence, however, Li Heng's trusted eunuch Li Fuguo, Li Chu's brother Li Tan the Prince of Jianning, and Li Chu, persuaded Li Heng not to follow Emperor Xuanzong to Chengdu—arguing that with the physical barriers between Chang'an and Jiannan Circuit (劍南, headquartered in modern Chengdu), that once they had left the region, Chang'an could no longer be captured. Li Heng agreed and had Li Chu report this to Emperor Xuanzong. Emperor Xuanzong agreed with Li Heng's decision, but he himself continued on to Jiannan. Li Heng, escorted by a small number of guard soldiers commanded by Li Tan, then headed to the border city of Lingwu. With the army at Lingwu pressuring him to take imperial title, Li Heng declared himself emperor (as Emperor Suzong).\n\nAfter Emperor Suzong assumed imperial title, he considered making Li Tan the supreme commander of the armed forces, but his advisor Li Mi pointed out that Li Chu was older and that naming Li Tan the supreme commander would cause confusion as to who would be his heir. Emperor Daizong agreed and made Li Chu the supreme commander instead. Subsequently, Li Chu and Li Mi were entrusted with the keys of the makeshift palace, and one would always be on duty to be ready to receive important military reports. In 757, Emperor Suzong considered creating Li Chu crown prince, but Li Mi and Li Chu, pointing out that it would be inappropriate to do so before Chang'an were recaptured, advised him otherwise. Subsequently, Emperor Suzong's court was also itself filled with internal struggles, with Li Fuguo aligned with Emperor Suzong's favorite concubine Consort Zhang, in opposition to Li Chu, Li Tan, and Li Mi. In early 757, after Li Tan repeatedly accused Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang of corruption, Li Fuguo and Empress Zhang in turn falsely accused him of trying to assassinate Li Chu in order to become the heir. Emperor Suzong, in anger, ordered Li Tan to commit suicide, which drew fear from Li Chu and Li Mi. Li Chu considered assassinating Li Fuguo and Consort Zhang, but at Li Mi's urging, stopped his plans to do so.\n\nIn fall 757, troops from Huige, whose Bayanchur Khan Yaoluoge Moyanchuo had answered Emperor Suzong's request for help, arrived under the command of Yaoluoge Moyanchuo's son. When Li Chu met the Huige prince, he offered for them to be sworn brothers. The prince was very pleased and honored Li Chu as an older brother. Thereafter, the joint Tang and Huige troops proceeded toward Chang'an and, after defeating Yan forces at Xiangji Temple (), near Chang'an, recaptured Chang'an. Emperor Suzong had promised that Huige forces would be allowed to pillage Chang'an, but at the earnest pleas of Li Chu, the Huige prince agreed to wait until capturing Luoyang, which had become the Yan capital, to carry out the pillage. The people of Chang'an, believing that Li Chu had saved them from a deadly Huige rampage, welcomed him in a grand procession and proclaimed, \"The Prince of Guangping is truly a leader to be loved by both the Han and the barbarians.\" Meanwhile, when Pugu Huai'en advocated quick advances to try to capture the Yan generals An Shouzhong () and Li Guiren (), Li Chu, pointing out that his own troops were tired, stopped him. (Upon the recapturing of Chang'an, Li Mi resigned and became a hermit, depriving Li Chu of an ally.)\n\nSubsequently, Li Chu, Guo Ziyi, and Pugu, along with Huige forces, continued to proceed toward Luoyang. They first attacked Shancheng (陝城, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and initially could not succeed, but when Huige forces engaged, Yan forces were thrown into a panic and fled. Hearing the news, An Lushan's son and successor An Qingxu, who had become the emperor of Yan, abandoned Luoyang and fled. Once Huige forces entered Luoyang, they went on a rampage. Li Chu had the people gather up a large cache of silk to bribe the Huige prince, and only thereafter did the rampage end.\n\nUpon Li Chu's entry into Luoyang, he initially announced that the Tang officials who had surrendered to Yan would be forgiven. However, soon they were rearrested and delivered to Chang'an. Several were executed, while many others were punished by demotion or exile. In winter 757, Li Chu returned to Chang'an with Guo, and was subsequently created the greater title of Prince of Chu. In spring 758, his title was changed to Prince of Cheng. Emperor Suzong wanted to further create him crown prince, but hesitated because Consort Zhang, who had since been created empress, had a son named Li Shao (), carrying the title of Prince of Zhao, whom she wanted to be crown prince. When he consulted the chancellor Li Kui, Li Kui advocated for Li Chu, and Emperor Suzong agreed, creating Li Chu crown prince on June 29, 758. He also changed Li Chu's name to Li Yu. However, it was said that Empress Zhang did not give up the idea of having Li Shao become crown prince and was looking for ways to undermine Li Yu. Li Yu tried to react with meekness and humility. After Li Shao died in 759, because Empress Zhang's other son, Li Tong () the Prince of Ding was still young, Li Yu's position was no longer threatened.\n\nIn 762, Emperor Suzong had become seriously ill. After Emperor Xuanzong died in summer 762, Emperor Suzong, in mourning, grew worse. He had Li Yu assume regent powers. By this point, Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo were no longer allies, and Empress Zhang summoned Li Yu, wanting an alliance with him to kill Li Fuguo and his subordinate Cheng Yuanzhen. Li Yu refused, pointing out that this would cause alarm to the very-ill Emperor Suzong. Empress Zhang then entered into an alliance with Li Yu's younger brother Li Xi () the Prince of Yue, and they tried to set a trap for Li Fuguo, with 200 strong eunuchs loyal to her and Li Xi ready to act against Li Fuguo. On May 14, 762, she issued an order in Emperor Suzong's name, summoning Li Yu into the palace. However, Cheng received this news and reported this to Li Fuguo and Li Yu, and Cheng then escorted Li Yu to the imperial guard headquarters. Imperial guards commanded by Li Fuguo and Cheng then entered the palace and arrested Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and their associates. It was said that with Emperor Suzong resting at Changsheng Hall (), the soldiers dragged Empress Zhang and the attending ladies in waiting and eunuchs away from his presence. Emperor Suzong was said to be left alone without attendants. He died on May 16. Li Fuguo executed Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and Li Xian () the Prince of Yan. On May 18, Li Yu ascended the throne (as Emperor Daizong).\n\nLi Fuguo effectively took over the control of the imperial government, going as far as telling Emperor Daizong:\n\nEmperor Daizong was secretly displeased, but in order to placate Li Fuguo, gave him the title of \"Shangfu\" (尚父, meaning, \"like father\") and ordered that he not be referred to by name. He also made Li Fuguo \"Sikong\" (司空, one of the Three Excellencies) and \"Zhongshu Ling\" () – the head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, \"Zhongshu Sheng\") and a post considered one for a chancellor. Li Fuguo gave a major part of the command responsibilities to Cheng Yuanzhen. Carrying out further retaliation against Xiao Hua, Li Fuguo had Xiao further demoted.\n\nMeanwhile, though, Li Fuguo did not expect that both Emperor Daizong and Cheng, who wanted more power, would turn against him. In summer 762, at Cheng's secret suggestion, Emperor Daizong issued an edict that stripped Li Fuguo of the titles of minister of defense and assistant of military affairs to the supreme commander—thus stripping him of military command—giving the latter post to Cheng. He also ordered Li Fuguo to leave the palace and take residence up outside, although he created Li Fuguo the Prince of Bolu. Li Fuguo became apprehensive and offered to retire, and Emperor Daizong declined and sent him away with formal respect. Because Li Fuguo had killed Empress Zhang and had supported him for the throne, Emperor Daizong did not want to kill him openly. Instead, on November 8, 762, an assassin got into Li Fuguo's mansion and killed him, taking his head and an arm away as well. Emperor Daizong formally issued an order seeking the arrest of the assassin, and buried Li Fuguo in a grand ceremony, after having a wooden head and wooden arm carved to be buried with the rest of the body.\n\nAt this point, Emperor Daizong still had to face Yan, now ruled by Shi Chaoyi—the son and successor to Shi Siming, who had killed and succeeded An Qingxu and recaptured Luoyang from Tang in 759. Late in 762, he sent the eunuch Liu Qingtan () to Huige to request aid from its Dengli Khan Yaoluoge Yidijian (a younger brother of the Huige prince that he had previously become sworn brother to), who had also received an alliance proposal from Shi Chaoyi. Yaoluoge Yidijian thus initially rejected Emperor Daizong's proposal and advanced south to aid Shi Chaoyi, but after further persuasion by Pugu Huai'en, whose daughter he had married, he agreed with the Tang proposal. In winter 762, the joint Tang and Huige forces recaptured Luoyang, forcing Shi Chaoyi to flee. (Shi Chaoyi would eventually commit suicide in spring 763, ending Yan.)\n\nIn the aftermaths of Yan's destruction, Emperor Daizong contemplated what to do with several Yan generals who had surrendered to Tang but who still retained substantial holdings—Xue Song, Li Huaixian, Zhang Zhongzhi (on whom Emperor Daizong soon bestowed the imperial surname of Li and a new personal name, Baochen), and Tian Chengsi. Pugu suggested that he allow them to remain at their posts as military governors (\"Jiedushi\") to avoid further resistance, and Emperor Daizong, fearful of further wars, agreed. This would mark the beginning of warlordism that plagued Tang for the rest of the dynasty.\n\nIn fall 763, Emperor Daizong faced two new additional threats. Pugu, whom two other generals Xin Yunjing () and Li Baoyu and the eunuch Luo Fengxian () had suspected of plotting rebellion, was angry at the suspicion on him and, after submitting a number of accusatory petitions, began to act independently of the imperial government. Meanwhile, though, Tibet, which had begun to seize Tang western prefectures one by one during the Anshi Rebellion, launched a sudden attack on Chang'an. At that time, with Cheng in power and the generals hating him for his previous accusations against the generals Lai Tian () and Li Huairang () that led to their deaths, when Emperor Daizong sought emergency aid from the provincial generals, none came to his aid, and on November 16, he was forced to abandon Chang'an and flee to Shan Prefecture (i.e., Shancheng). Tibetan forces declared Emperor Suzong's cousin Li Chenghong the Prince of Guangwu the Emperor of Tang, although they withdrew within the course of a month due to the Tang people's resistance efforts and counterattacks commanded by Guo Ziyi. Emperor Daizong was able to soon return to Chang'an. Still, much territory had fallen into Tibetan hands and Tang forces were not able to counterattack. As the popular sentiment at the time blamed Cheng for the disaster, he stripped Cheng of his posts and sent him back to his home. Soon thereafter, the most powerful figures at court became the chancellor Yuan Zai, who flattered Emperor Daizong, and the eunuch Yu Chao'en, who commanded the imperial guards.\n\nIn 764, Emperor Daizong created Li Kuo, whom he had earlier signaled to be the likely heir by designating him the supreme commander of the armed forces, crown prince. Li Kuo's mother Consort Shen had been captured by Yan forces and disappeared during the Anshi Rebellion; Emperor Daizong sent many imperial messengers throughout the realm to search for Consort Shen, but was not able to find her.\n\nMeanwhile, also in 764, Pugu Huai'en, then at Hezong (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), formally rose against Tang imperial troops, against his mother's advice. An attack against Yuci (榆次, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), commanded by Pugu Huai'en's son Pugu Yang (), however, was repelled by Tang forces, and Pugu Yang's own soldiers killed him. Pugu, believing he was facing defeat, took his troops, largely from Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), back to its headquarters at Lingwu and dug in there; he thereafter remained a threat to the Tang imperial government, although Emperor Daizong, still hoping that he would resubmit, never formally declared him a renegade, and when Pugu's mother, who did not follow him to Lingwu, died, he buried her with honors.\n\nAround this time, the official Liu Yan headed a project to reopen Bian River (), a canal that connected the Yellow River and the Huai River, which had been crucial for shipping food supplies from the Yangtze River-Huai River region to Chang'an and Luoyang prior to the Anshi Rebellion but which had become silted during the wars. After the project was completed, Chang'an again had adequate food supplies, allowing the region to begin to recover.Pugu, meanwhile, had allied with Huige and Tibet, and in late 764 and then again in 765 allied with them to attack the Chang'an region. After Pugu died in 765, however, the threat subsided, and his army resubmitted to Emperor Daizong. However, by this point, Emperor was facing, in addition to the four major Yan generals, two more military governors who were \"de facto\" independent, Li Zhengji and Liang Chongyi.\n\nAlso in 765, after Yan Wu () the military governor of Jiannan Circuit died, the succeeding military governor Guo Ying'ai (), resentful that the officer Cui Ning had not recommended him to succeed Yan, attacked Cui. Cui counterattacked and defeated Guo, who was killed in flight, and the circuit was thrown into a confusion. Eventually, the situation settled down, but the circuit eventually became effectively independently ruled by Cui, although Cui was more obedient and respectful to the central government than the other warlords. Emperor Daizong tried to have the chancellor Du Hongjian rule the circuit, but Du, unwilling to challenge Cui, soon returned to Chang'an and left the circuit in Cui's hands.\n\nMeanwhile, by this point, Emperor Daizong, who had previously favored Taoism, had begun to become a devout Buddhist due to the influences of his chancellors Yuan Zai, Wang Jin, and Du Hongjian. Yuan, in particular, advocated the belief that it was by the blessings of the Buddha that Tang was able to survive the Anshi Rebellion and Pugu's rebellion. As a result, Emperor Daizong's policies began to be heavily influenced by Buddhist principles, and he honored the Buddhist monk Bukong with great honors, including creating him a duke. The temples at Chang'an became very wealthy, and Emperor Daizong further ordered that monks and nuns not be subject to physical punishments. With the emperor and the chancellors all devout Buddhists, Buddhism became the leading influence in the empire. (Traditional historians, such as the Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang, ascribed the poor governance and justice system during Emperor Daizong's time to this.)\n\nIn 768, after Li Huaixian was assassinated by his officers Zhu Xicai, Zhu Ci, and Zhu Ci's brother Zhu Tao, Emperor Daizong made an attempt to take back control of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), which Li Huaixian had governed. He made Wang Jin the military governor and Zhu Xicai the acting military governor. When Wang arrived at the circuit, Zhu Xicai paid him great respect but did not allow him to take actual rein of the circuit, and Wang returned to Chang'an soon thereafter. Emperor Daizong was forced to make Zhu Xicai the military governor later in the year.\n\nIn 770, Emperor Daizong, tired of Yu Chao'en's hold on power and arrogance, plotted with Yuan and laid a trap for Yu, killing him. Thereafter, however, Yuan's power became unchallenged at court.\n\nIn 772, Zhu Xicai was in turn assassinated by his subordinate Li Huaiyuan (), and Zhu Ci replaced him. Zhu Ci took a more respectful stand toward the imperial government, and thereafter, while the central government did not take back actual control of Lulong, Lulong soldiers often participated in campaigns commissioned by the imperial government. (Eventually, indeed, Zhu Ci himself would arrive at Chang'an and thereafter remain an imperial general near Chang'an and not return to Lulong, leaving Lulong in Zhu Tao's hands.)\n\nIn 773, Xue Song died, and Emperor Daizong agreed to let his brother Xue E succeed him in ruling Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). However, Tian Chengsi, who ruled nearby Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), had other designs. In spring 775, under his encouragement, the Zhaoyi officer Pei Zhiqing () rose against Xue E, and Tian subsequently captured Zhaoyi's capital Xiang Prefecture (). Xue E fled to imperial territory, while Tian continued his campaign to capture the rest of Zhaoyi territory despite Emperor Daizong's orders to stop his campaign. With Xue Song's other relatives Xue Xiong () and Xue Jian () still holding Wei (衛州, in modern Xinxiang, Henan) and Ming (洺州, in modern Handan) Prefectures, Tian attacked them and captured those prefectures, as well as Ci Prefecture (磁州, in modern Handan as well). (The remaining prefectures of Zhaoyi came under imperial control and were eventually merged with Zelu Circuit (澤潞, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), governed by Li Baoyu's cousin Li Baozhen.)\n\nThese defiant actions by Tian, who had already angered Li Zhengji, then ruling Pinglu Circuit (平盧, then headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong), by disrespecting him and Li Baochen, then ruling Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), by killing Li Baochen's brother Li Baozheng (), brought a serious imperial response, along with the offended warlords. In summer 775, Emperor Daizong announced a campaign against Tian, with Li Zhengji and Li Zhongchen attacking Weibo from the south, and Zhu Tao, Li Baochen, and Xue Jianxun () attacking Weibo from the north. Initially, the imperial forces were scoring victories over Weibo forces, but after Tian flattered Li Zhengji in a humble letter, Li Zhengji withdrew from the campaign, causing other imperial generals south of the Yellow River to hesitate to advance as well. Meanwhile, Li Baochen was offended when an imperial eunuch, Ma Chengqian (), who had visited Li Baochen's army, was so dissatisfied with Li Baochen's gift to him that he threw it on the ground, and Tian was also able to use hoaxes to persuade Li Baochen that if he joined forces with Tian to attack Lulong, he would be successful. Li Baochen thus turned against Zhu, launching a surprise attack on him, but was unable to kill Zhu, effectively ending any hopes of the campaign against Tian. By 776, Emperor Daizong was forced to pardon Tian and abandon the campaign.\n\nAlso in 775, Emperor Daizong's favorite concubine Consort Dugu died. He posthumously honored her empress and, saddened greatly by her death, kept her casket in the palace for almost three years, only finally burying her in 778.\n\nIn 776, after the death of Biansong Circuit (汴宋, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan)'s acting military governor Tian Shenyu (), its officer Li Lingyao () seized the circuit. Emperor Daizong commissioned a campaign by the surrounding circuits against Biansong and Li Lingyao, despite aid from Tian, was quickly defeated, although the imperial government received little benefit as five of Biansong's eight prefectures were taken by and merged into Li Zhengji's Pinglu Circuit, and, indeed, Li Zhengji then moved his headquarters from Qing Prefecture () to one of the Biansong prefectures he took, Yun Prefecture (鄆州, in modern Tai'an, Shandong).\n\nIn 777, Emperor Daizong, tired of Yuan Zai's and Wang Jin's corruption and hold on power, had them arrested. Yuan was executed and Wang was exiled, and they were replaced by Yang Wan and Chang Gun. Emperor Daizong hoped that Yang could lead a reform of the government, but Yang died later in the year, leaving Chang in control of the government.\n\nBy 777, it was considered that these warlords were ruling their realms \"de facto\" independently:\n\n\nIn 779, Tian died, and Emperor Daizong permitted Tian's nephew Tian Yue to succeed him. Meanwhile, Li Zhongchen was expelled from his Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) by his officer Li Xilie. Emperor Daizong, believing Li Zhongchen to have been faithful to him, kept him at Chang'an as a chancellor, while making Li Xilie acting military governor.\n\nIn summer 779, Emperor Daizong grew ill and soon died. Li Kuo succeeded him as emperor (as Emperor Dezong).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Often, the question has been written by the Minister or their staff rather than by the questioner, and is used to give the Minister a chance to promote themselves or the work of the Government, or to criticise the opposition party's policies, to raise the profile of the backbench Member asking the question, or to consume the time available for questioning and thereby avoid tougher questions. It is a common and widely accepted tactic during Question Time in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nWhile it is rare, it would be possible for a backbencher on the Government side of the house to ask a member of the Government a question without it being regarded as a Dorothy Dixer. Such a question would be one that the Minister had not planted and was not aware of in advance. \n\nIt is common for \"Dorothy Dixers\" to end in the question: \"Is the Minister aware of any alternative policies?\" This enables the responding Minister to launch into extended criticism of the Opposition and its policy on the question's subject matter, while still remaining technically relevant to the question as asked, as Standing orders require.\n\nThe term references American advice columnist Dorothy Dix's reputed practice of making up her own questions to allow her to publish more interesting answers. \"Dorothy Dixer\" has been used in Australian politics since the 1950s, and has become increasingly common in everyday usage, although the term is now frequently shortened to \"Dixer\".

{"id": "2067066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067066", "title": "Optical microcavity", "text": "Optical microcavity\n\nAn optical microcavity or microresonator is a structure formed by reflecting faces on the two sides of a spacer layer or optical medium, or by wrapping a waveguide in a circular fashion to form a ring. The former type is a standing wave cavity, and the latter is a traveling wave cavity. The name \"micro\"cavity stems from the fact that it is often only a few micrometers thick, the spacer layer sometimes even in the nanometer range. As with common lasers this forms an optical cavity or \"optical resonator\", allowing a standing wave to form inside the spacer layer, or a traveling wave that goes around in the ring.\n\nThe fundamental difference between a conventional optical cavity and microcavities is the effects that arise from the small dimensions of the system, but their operational principle can often be understood in the same way as for larger optical resonators. Quantum effects of the light's electromagnetic field can be observed. For example, the spontaneous emission rate and behaviour of atoms is altered by such a microcavity, a phenomenon that is referred to as inhibited spontaneous emission. One can imagine this as the situation that no photon is emitted, if the environment is a box that is too small to hold it. This leads to an altered emission spectrum, which is significantly narrowed. \n\nMoreover, nonlinear effects are enhanced by orders of magnitude due to the strong light confinement, leading to the generation of microresonator frequency combs, low-power parametric processes such as down-conversion, second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing and optical parametric oscillation. Several of these nonlinear processes themselves lead to the generation of quantum states of light. Another field that harnesses the strong confinement of light is cavity optomechanics, where the back-and-forth interaction of the light beam with the mechanical motion of the resonator becomes strongly coupled. Even in this field, quantum effects can start playing a role.\n\nMicrocavities have many applications, frequently at present in optoelectronics, where vertical cavity surface emitting lasers VCSEL are probably the best known. Recently, a single photon emitting device was demonstrated by placing a quantum dot in a microcavity. These light sources are interesting for quantum cryptography and quantum computers.\n\nAn overview is given in the review article published in the journal Nature.\n\nFor a microcavity supporting a single-mode or a few standing-wave modes, the thickness of the spacer layer determines the so-called \"cavity-mode\", which is the one wavelength that can be transmitted and will be formed as a standing wave inside the resonator. Depending on the type and quality of the mirrors, a so-called stop-band will form in the transmission spectrum of the microcavity, a long range of wavelengths, that is reflected and a single one being transmitted (usually in the centre). There are different means of fabricating standing-wave microcavities, either by evaporating alternating layers of dielectric media to form the mirrors (DBR) and the medium inside the spacer layer or by modification of semiconductor material or by metal mirrors.\n\nOften just called \"microresonators\", traveling wave microcavities have a wave going around in a loop-like fashion in a preferred direction, depending on the input light direction. They can be in the form of whispering-gallery resonators, or as integrated ring resonators. Typical materials from which they are made could be semiconductors like Silicon, Silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, crystalline fluorides (CaF, MgF, SrF) or lithium niobate. The material is chosen such that it is low-loss and transparent in the wavelength of application desired. Typically, such structures are fabricated by either diamond turning or micromachining a cylindrical rod of a material (especially for fluorides and lithium niobate), or by photolithography and electron-beam lithography to produce a patterned resonator on chip (for silicon-based materials).\n\nWhen an integer number of wavelengths in the material fits in the circumference of the resonator, a resonant wave is excited by constructive interference. At resonance, the light field can be enhanced by several hundred to several million times, quantified by the Finesse Coefficient of the resonator. This also leads to an ultrahigh quality factor, meaning that light travels around the circumference many million times before decaying into the surroundings.\n"}

The auction was eagerly followed by bibliophiles, the high point being the sale on 17 June 1812 of a first edition of Boccaccio's \"Decameron\", printed by Christophorus Valdarfer of Venice in 1471, and sold to the Marquis of Blandford for £2,260, the highest price ever given for a book at that time. (The Marquis already possessed a copy, but one that lacked 5 pages.) That evening, a group of eighteen collectors met at the St Albans Tavern, St Albans Street (later renamed Waterloo Place) for a dinner presided over by the 2nd Earl Spencer, and this is regarded as the origin of the Roxburghe Club.\n\nA toast drunk on that occasion has been repeated at every annual anniversary dinner since to the \"immortal memory of John Duke of Roxburghe, of Christopher Valdarfer, printer of the \"Boccaccio\" of 1471, of Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer, the inventors of the art of printing, of William Caxton, Father of the British press [and others; and] the prosperity of the Roxburghe Club and the Cause of Bibliomania all over the world\". It was decided to make the dinner an annual event: further members were admitted the following year. The club was formed by Thomas Frognall Dibdin, author of the book \"Bibliomania; or Book-Madness\" (1809), who served as its first secretary; and the club was formalised under Earl Spencer's presidency.\n\nThe Club has had a total of 350 members from its foundation to 2017. The circle has always been an exclusive one, with just one \"black ball\" (negative vote) being enough to exclude an applicant. Since 1839 the number of members at any one time has been limited to forty.\n\nA photograph exists of the membership in 1892, including the Prime Minister Arthur Balfour and anthropologist Andrew Lang, as well as American poet James Russell Lowell, Alfred Henry Huth, and Simon Watson Taylor. James Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, was then President.\n\nThe first female member was Mary, Viscountess Eccles, elected in 1985. In 2011, the Australian comedian Barry Humphries was elected a member. The President since 1998 has been Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont.\n\nThe Club rapidly became more than a merely social institution. Each member was (and remains) expected to sponsor the publication of a rare or curious volume. Other volumes are published by the Club collectively. Initially the volumes were editions of early blackletter printed texts (the first, in 1814, was the Earl of Surrey's translation of parts of Virgil's Aeneid, originally printed in 1557); but from as early as 1819 they began to include texts taken from manuscript originals. The standards of scholarship are high, and the quality of printing, facsimile reproduction, and binding is lavish. Copies of each volume (in a fine binding) are presented to all members, and a limited number of extra copies (generally in a less lavish binding) may be made available for sale to non-members. From 1839, the total number of copies for each publication, including members' copies, was limited to 100. Recently, the limit was raised to 342 copies: 42 for the club, 300 for the public. The Roxburghe Club is generally recognised as the first \"book club\" (that is, text publication society), and was a model for many book societies that appeared later in Britain and Europe.\n\nA full list of the \"Membership since 1812\" can be found on the club website.\n\n\n"}

The series was created by Paul Mendelson and produced by Cinema Verity. The series was nominated for the BAFTA award for \"Best Television Comedy Series\" in 1991, but lost out to \"The New Statesman\".\n\nSet in Pinner, London, it revolved around the romance between a widowed solicitor, Alec Callender (played by veteran television actor Anton Rodgers) and a much younger woman, Zoë Angell (played by Eve Matheson in series one and two, and by Lesley Dunlop in series three to six).\n\nThe title of the show comes from the Anderson-Weill song \"September Song\", which is sung during the credits.\n\nThe titles of all of the episodes of \"May to December\" are taken from songs. Most are from musicals, reflecting Alec and Zoë's mutual interest, but some later ones are hits from the 50s and 60s.\n\nIn keeping with a number of other BBC sitcoms, such as To the Manor Born, Yes, Minister, As Time Goes By and a number of others, in 1992 a radio adaptation of episodes was proposed. Episodes would have been adapted from the original television scripts, with Lesley Dunlop playing Zoë throughout. However, the radio version was dropped and never recorded, due to the changing demographic of BBC radio's listeners and output in the early 1990s.\n\n\nNote: The original run of Series 1 had a different opening credits sequence, partly featuring an animated oak tree through the different seasons of the year, as well as a slightly different recording the theme song. A repeat run of the first series that began in August 1990 replaced these with the opening visuals and audio from the second series (which had also incorporated a number of shots from the first series). All later repeats and subsequent DVD releases continue to use the second series version of the opening.\n\n\"May to December\" series one and series two are both available on DVD in the UK, distributed by Acorn Media UK.\n\n"}
{"id": "2067079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067079", "title": "Joe Harriott", "text": "Joe Harriott\n\nJoseph Arthurlin Harriott (15 July 1928 – 2 January 1973) was a Jamaican jazz musician and composer, whose principal instrument was the alto saxophone.\n\nInitially a bebopper, he became a pioneer of free-form jazz. Born in Kingston, Harriot moved to the United Kingdom as a working musician in 1951 and lived in the country for the rest of his life. Harriott was part of a wave of Caribbean jazz musicians who arrived in Britain during the 1950s, including Dizzy Reece, Harold McNair, Harry Beckett and Wilton Gaynair.\n\nBorn in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1928, Harriott was educated at Alpha Boys School, an orphanage in the city. At Alpha he learned to play the clarinet, the instrument that was assigned to him shortly before his tenth birthday. He took up the baritone and tenor saxophone while performing with local dance bands before settling on the alto saxophone. Harriott arrived in London in the summer of 1951, aged 23, as a member of Ossie Da Costa's band. British subjects did not require work-permits or immigration visas at that time. When the band had completed their tour Harriott decided to stay in London. He caught the attention of London's jazz scene while sitting in at the Feldman Club on Oxford Street on 26 August 1951.\n\nLike the majority of alto players of his generation, he was deeply influenced by Charlie Parker. Harriott developed a style that fused Parker with his own Jamaican musical sensibility - most notably the mento and calypso music he grew up with. Even in his later experiments, Harriott's roots were always audible. However, it was his mastery of bebop that gained him immediate kudos within the British jazz scene upon his arrival in London.\n\nDuring the 1950s, he had two long spells with drummer Tony Kinsey's band, punctuated by membership of Ronnie Scott's short-lived big band, occasional spells leading his own quartet and working in the quartets of drummers Phil Seamen and Allan Ganley. Harriott began recording under his own name in 1954, releasing a handful of E.P. (extended play) records for Columbia, Pye/Nixa and Melodisc throughout the 1950s. However, the majority of his 1950s recordings were as a sideman with the musicians previously mentioned, also backing a diverse array of performers, from mainstream vocalist Lita Roza to traditional trombonist George Chisholm to the West African sounds of Buddy Pipp's Highlifers. Harriott also appeared alongside visiting American musicians during this period, including a \"guest artist\" slot on the Modern Jazz Quartet's 1959 UK tour. He formed his own quintet in 1958, and their style of hard-swinging bebop was noticed in the United States, leading to the release of the \"Southern Horizons\" and \"Free Form\" albums on the American Jazzland label.\n\nBy now firmly established as a bebop soloist, in 1960 Harriott turned to what he termed \"abstract\" or \"free-form\" music. He had some loose free-form ideas by the mid-1950s, but finally settled upon his conception in 1959, after a protracted spell in hospital with tuberculosis. At first he struggled to recruit other like-minded musicians to his vision. Indeed, two of his core band members, Harry South and Hank Shaw, left when these ideas surfaced. He finally settled on a line-up of Shake Keane (trumpet, flugelhorn), Pat Smythe (piano), Coleridge Goode (bass) and Phil Seamen (drums). Les Condon temporarily replaced Keane on trumpet in 1961, while Seamen left permanently the same year, his place taken by the return of the quintet's previous drummer, Bobby Orr. Frank Holder toured with Harriott and contributed to recording projects during this period.\n\nHarriott's free-form music is often compared to Ornette Coleman's roughly contemporary breakthrough in the United States, but even cursory listening reveals deep divisions between their conceptions of \"free jazz\". Indeed, there were several distinctive models of early free jazz, from Cecil Taylor to Sun Ra. Harriott's was another of these. His method demanded more complete group improvisation than displayed in Coleman's music, and often featured no particular soloist. Instead of the steady pulse of Ornette's drummer and bass player, Harriott's model demanded constant dialogue between musicians, which created an ever-shifting soundscape. Tempo, key and meter always free to alter in this music, and often did so. The presence of Bill Evans-inspired pianist Pat Smythe also gave the band a completely different texture to Coleman's, which had dispensed with the need for a pianist early on. Harriott's own playing style underwent some changes during this period, dispensing with orthodox bebop lines in favour of more angular, cut up phrasing. What remained however, was his lyricism, searing tone and sense of attack.\n\nHarriott was always keen to communicate his ideas, be it on stage, in interviews or album liner notes. In 1962, he wrote in the liner notes for his \"Abstract\" album, \"of the various components comprising jazz today - constant time signatures, a steady four-four tempo, themes and predictable harmonic variations, fixed division of the chorus by bar lines and so on, we aim to retain at least one in each piece. But we may well, if the mood seems to us to demand it, dispense with all the others\".\n\nHe recorded three albums in this vein: \"Free Form\" (Jazzland, 1960), \"Abstract\" (Columbia (UK), 1962) and \"Movement\" (Columbia (UK), 1963). \"Abstract\" received a five-star review from Harvey Pekar in \"DownBeat\", the first such honour for a British Jazz record. \"Free Form\" and \"Abstract\" together formed a perfect pair of cohesive, trailblazing free jazz sessions. The next album, \"Movement\", featured some of his most fiercely abstract compositions, but these were tempered by some other, more straight-ahead pieces.\n\nHarriott's free-form compositions normally formed only a portion of live gigs. Indeed, the final album recorded by the quintet, 1964's \"High Spirits\" (Columbia), was a straight-ahead jazz interpretation of compositions from the musical of that name, which was based on the Noël Coward play \"Blithe Spirit\". However, the continuing hostility of the older British jazz establishment to free form, and the drying up of recording and performance opportunities, saw Harriott's quintet cease to be sustainable in the changing musical climate of mid-1960s Britain. The quintet effectively broke up when Shake Keane moved to Germany in 1965. From this point onwards, Harriott worked freelance on a number of projects.\n\nHe made several albums and EPs with pianist/composer Michael Garrick in the mid-sixties, notably \"Promises\", \"October Woman\" and \"Black Marigolds\". The latter two were reissued by Dutton Vocalion on CD in 2005, and Garrick's \"Poetry and Jazz In Concert\" albums (which also featured Harriott) were released on CD by the same label in 2006. Another notable recording as a sideman was with the bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II, on a 1964 session that also featured Jimmy Page.\n\nDuring the late 1960s he and violinist John Mayer developed \"Indo-Jazz Fusion\" - an early attempt at building on music from diverse traditions. This involved a \"double quintet\" of five Indian and five jazz musicians playing together on a number of compositions largely conceived by Mayer. Opinion is divided on the success of these experiments. At their best, they offered a new and unique fusion of styles, but at times one can also detect a restriction on the freedom of the jazzmen to improvise. Three albums resulted from the collaboration with Mayer: \"Indo-Jazz Suite\" (Atlantic 1966) \"Indo-Jazz Fusions\" Volumes 1 and 2 (Columbia (UK), 1967 and 1968).\n\nTwo other Harriott albums appeared in 1967 and 1968. The first, \"Swings High\" (Melodisc), was a strangely retrospective-sounding, but outstanding bebop record featuring old cohorts Seamen, Goode and Smythe; 1968's \"Personal Portrait\" (Columbia) was a mixed bag of jazz with strings and some affecting work with old bandmate Smythe and Stan Tracey.\n\nIn 1969, Harriott recorded the album \"Hum-Dono\" in collaboration with the Goan guitarist Amancio D'Silva. This was an unqualified success. Also featuring trumpeter Ian Carr and vocalist Norma Winstone, this album presented a more subtle and fluid mix of Harriott's signature alto sound with D'Silva's unique Indo-bebop guitar style.\n\nAlso in 1969, Harriott made an appearance at Stan Tracey's Duke Ellington tribute concert, which was also released as the album \"We Love You Madly\" on Columbia. Harriott contributed a moving solo on \"In a Sentimental Mood\" that was captured for posterity by TV cameras, thus leaving the only existing footage of him in performance. He also made an important contribution to composer Laurie Johnson's 1970 LP, \"Synthesis\" (also Columbia).\n\nHarriott's work in 1969 was to be the last substantial performances of his career. While he continued to play around Britain wherever he was welcome, no further recording opportunities arose. He was virtually destitute in his last years, and ravaged by illness. He died of cancer on 2 January 1973, and is buried in Bitterne churchyard, in Southampton. On his gravestone, his own oft-quoted words provide his epitaph: \"Parker? There's them over here can play a few aces too.\"\n\nSince his death, Harriott's often overlooked contribution to the birth of free jazz has gradually been recognised. While he influenced important European free jazz pioneers such as John Stevens, Evan Parker and Albert Mangelsdorff, in the States his profile and influence was much smaller, despite the admiration of such figures as Charles Mingus. He also suffered mightily from lazy journalistic comparisons with Ornette Coleman, but more recently his originality has been recognised across the globe. American saxophonist Ken Vandermark's CD of Harriott free-form compositions, entitled \"Straight Lines\", has introduced his music to another generation of free jazz fans. British players such as Courtney Pine, Gary Crosby and more recently Soweto Kinch have also acknowledged his influence and played his music on stage. An important biography by Alan Robertson, as well as the publication of Coleridge Goode's poignant reminiscences of him, have helped to make Harriott's story more widely known.\n\nHarriott's profile has also been helped by CD reissues of his most important albums, notably \"Abstract\", \"Free Form\" and \"Movement\". However, other key albums such as \"Hum-Dono\" have yet to be reissued. In recent years, other recordings of Harriott in his prime have surfaced. Michael Garrick has compiled and released a CD on his own Jazz Academy label, entitled \"Genius\". This consists of some early 1960s live performances and home recordings made with a pianist friend, William Haig-Joyce. In 2006, a 1963 live recording made at a small club in Leicester was unearthed and issued on CD, entitled \"Live At Harry's\". In early 2007, many of his hard-to-find mid-1950s sessions, both as leader and sideman, were made available on the double-CD compilation \"Killer Joe\".\n\nA four-CD set entitled \"The Joe Harriott Story\" (Proper Box) was issued in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Administratively, Izmail is incorporated as a city of oblast significance. It also serves as the administrative center of Izmail Raion, one of twenty-six districts of Odessa Oblast, though it is not a part of the district.\n\nIn Russian historiography Izmail is associated with the 18th century sacking of Ottoman fortress of Izmail by Russian general Alexander Suvorov.\n\nIt is the largest Ukrainian port in the Danube Delta, on its Chilia branch. As such, Izmail is a center of the food processing industry and a popular regional tourist destination. It is also a base of the Ukrainian Navy and the Ukrainian Sea Guard units operating on the river. The World Wildlife Fund's \"Isles of Izmail Regional Landscape Park\" is located nearby. Population: \n\nThe fortress of Izmail was built by Genoese merchants in the 12th century. It belonged for a short period of time to Wallachia (14th century) – as the territory north of the Danube was one of the possessions of the Basarabs (later the land being named after them, \"Bessarabia\"). The town was first mentioned with the name \"Ismailiye\", derived from the name of the Ottoman Grand Vizier Izmail.\n\nFrom the end of the 14th century, Izmail was under the rule of Moldavia. In 1484, the Ottoman state conquered the territory, which became from that moment an Ottoman protectorate (under direct rule from 1538). Since the early 16th century it was the main Ottoman fortress in the Budjak region. In 1569 Sultan Selim II settled Izmail with his Nogai subjects, originally from the North Caucasus.\n\nAfter Russian general Nicholas Repnin took the fortress of Izmail in 1770, it was heavily refortified by the Turks, so as never to be captured again. The Sultan boasted that the fortress was impregnable, but during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 the Russian Army commander Alexander Suvorov successfully stormed it on 22 December 1790. Ottoman forces inside the fortress had the orders to stand their ground to the end, haughtily declining the Russian ultimatum. The defeat was seen as a catastrophe in the Ottoman Empire, while in Russia it was glorified in the country's first national anthem, \"Let the thunder of victory sound!\".\n\nSuvorov announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the Empress Catherine in a doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, room to room, most of the garrison and support forces in the city had been killed in three days, a few hundred taken into captivity. For all his bluffness, Suvorov later told an English traveler that when all was over he went back to his tent and wept.\n\nAt the end of the war, Izmail was returned to the Ottoman Empire, but Russian forces took it for the third time on 14 September 1809. After it was ceded to Russia with the rest of Bessarabia by the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest, the town was rebuilt thoroughly. The Intercession Cathedral (1822–36), the churches of Nativity (1823), St. Nicholas (1833) and several others date back to that time. Izmail's oldest building is the small Turkish mosque, erected either in the 15th or 16th centuries, converted into a church in 1810 and currently housing a museum dedicated to the 1790 storm of Izmail.\nAfter Russia lost the Crimean War, the town returned to the Principality of Moldavia, which would soon become part of the Romanian Principalities. Russia gained control of Izmail again after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. With the breakup of the Russian Empire in 1917 and in the aftermath of World War I, the city was occupied by the Romanian Army on 22 January 1918, after a skirmish with troops of the Danube flotilla. Later that year, the Sfatul Țării of Chișinău, which claimed to be the representative of the whole of Bessarabia, voted to formally unite the region with Romania. This union was recognized by the United Kingdom, France and Italy in the Treaty of Paris, but not by the Soviet Union which had territorial claims over Bessarabia.\n\nIn 1940, and again during World War II, it was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and included (August 1940) in the Ukrainian SSR; the region was occupied in 1941–1944 by the Romanian Army participating in Operation Barbarossa. During the Soviet period following World War II, many Russians and Ukrainians migrated to the town, gradually changing its ethnic composition. Izmail Oblast was formed in 1940 and the town remained its administrative center until the oblast was merged to Odessa Oblast in 1954. Since 24 August 1991, Izmail has been part of independent Ukraine.\n\nUnder the Köppen classification, Izmail has a humid continental climate (\"Dfa\") with four distinct seasons and generous precipitation year-round, typical for the inland South. Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures somewhat moderated by the city's elevation. Winters are cool but variable, with an average of 48 freezing days per year.\n\nBefore 1920, the population of Izmail was estimated at 37,000. During that time, approximately 11,000 of the population were Jewish, 8,000 Romanians and 6,000 Germans. Additional members of the population were Russians, Bulgarians, Turks and Cossacks.\n\nThe national composition (2001): Russians - 43.7% (33,600), Ukrainians - 38.0% (29,200), Bulgarians - 10.0% (7,700) and Romanians - 4.3% (3,300). In 2010, the population was 75,300. The population also consists of many other nationalities: Gagauz, Greeks, Jews, Armenians, etc. - 75 nationalities.\n\n\n"}

He ended his career by refereeing the match between Bayern Munich and Hertha BSC Berlin on the last day of the 2007–08 Bundesliga season on 17 May 2008.\n\nHe was ranked the best referee by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics in 2004, 2005 and 2008.\n\nHe is currently a pundit for Sky Deutschland and was the main referee commentator of the Turkish football channel Lig TV (which has the rights of the Turkish Super League) in 2010–2011 season.\n\nIn 1988, Merk was appointed the youngest Bundesliga referee ever, aged 25, representing his home club 1.

His assistants were Jan-Hendrik Salver and Christian Schräer. Merk also refereed the 1997 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, and the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final. He was the referee in the semi final of the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup between Cameroon and Colombia, a game remembered for the death of Marc-Vivien Foé.\n\nIn the 2006 World Cup, he whistled three matches. The United States vs. Ghana game was the last game in the 2006 World Cup for Merk, as he was not chosen to referee any of the games in the knockout stages. Merk was highly critical of the whole FIFA refereeing process after that, stating in the German sports TV show \"das aktuelle Sportstudio\", it \"robbed me two weeks of my life\" being forced to stay in the referee camp without a call-up, and adding a mere two was a bitterly meagre payoff regarding the fact he (among others) had to visit countless seminars and were sent on small junior tournaments all over the world to merely assist, comparing it to as if Ronaldinho would have to agree to sit on the bench for the Brazilian U 20 in order to qualify for the World Cup.\n\nMerk is also a long-time proponent of instant video replay to judge critical scenes. On 1 March 2008, Werder Bremen striker Markus Rosenberg scored a goal from clear offside position; Merk initially gave the goal, but immediately after that realised it was illegal, but it was too late to retract his error. He called it \"the most bitter moment of my career\" and called for introduction of instant replay.\n\n\nThe religious Merk is active helping slums in India, providing basic dental care for the poor since 1991. He helps the \"Indienhilfe Kaiserslautern\", which erects schools and housing for the homeless, as well as offering basic medical care.\n\nMerk was born in Kaiserslautern. A dentist by trade, he lives in Otterbach with his wife and son. He was a professional dentist until 2005, when he stopped practising because of his opposition to the so-called \"Praxisgebühr\", a measure introduced by the German government taxing patients visiting doctors. Today, he leads motivational seminars. During his youth and teens, Merk suffered ridicule because of his high-pitched, squeaky voice. After undergoing extensive speech therapy, he now talks in a normal baritone. (Reference: his book \"BeWEGEnd\").\n\nMerk is also one of the fittest referees in the game. He regularly laps his colleagues in the annual fitness tests, and his personal best for a marathon is 2:42. He is also a dedicated triathlete.\n\nAs a side note, \"Merk\" is the imperative form of the German verb \"merken\" (to notice, to keep in mind). For this reason, his homepage is named \"merk-es-dir.de\" (\"keep-it-in-mind.de\").\n\n\n"}

During the burial, Crusher sees a man she does not know who is obviously very interested in the events. Later, Crusher enters her grandmother's house and collects several mementos, which she takes onto the \"Enterprise\". Reading some diaries, she discovers that despite being 100 years old, her grandmother was involved with a 34-year-old man named Ronin.\n\nBack on the planet, a groundskeeper of her grandmother's tells her that there is a ghost in her grandmother's house and that she should leave immediately. He also tells her that she should never light the candle her grandmother always carried, since this candle will wake up the ghost. Beverly hears a voice that tells her he is a ghost and loved her grandmother and now also loves Beverly. Finally he becomes visible, and Beverly sees a man of about 30 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the colony is suffering from a major storm system, which the weather modification satellite is unable to correct. Data and Geordi attempt to fix the problem but are shocked to find Ned, the Howard groundskeeper, trying to stop them, before he is killed in an explosion.\n\nThe ghost called Ronin manipulates Beverly's mind so that she falls in love with him. Ronin tells her to light the candle, which is on the \"Enterprise\". Beverly beams up and lights the candle, and Ronin appears. Beverly tells Captain Picard that she wants to leave the \"Enterprise\" and live on the planet. Reluctantly, Picard agrees. Picard goes to Counselor Deanna Troi, with whom Crusher spoke about Ronin before she left.\n\nTroi tells Picard that Ronin is a very strange man, but they have to accept Beverly's decision. \nThen Picard beams down onto the planet and visits Beverly in her house. He wants to get to know Ronin, and finally Ronin appears. Picard asks questions which Ronin does not want to answer, and Ronin attacks Picard. Despite Ronin's objections, Beverly helps Picard.\n\nAt the cemetery, Geordi and Data have found an energy source in Beverly's grandmother's grave. They open the grave, and the grandmother rises and attacks them. Beverly arrives and orders Ronin to get out of her grandmother's body. Ronin does so and tells Beverly to give him the candle. She has by now discovered that he is an anaphasic alien who can only survive because the plasma-based candle is his energy receptacle. Beverly destroys the candle with a phaser and vaporizes Ronin when he attempts to possess her body.\n\nGeordi and Data are treated and recover. As Picard's log states, \"Doctor Crusher's recovery will be of a more personal nature.\" Troi and Crusher discuss the events in Ten Forward, where Crusher says that a part of her is a little sad.

{"id": "2067130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067130", "title": "Chinese Pidgin English", "text": "Chinese Pidgin English\n\nChinese Pidgin English (also called Chinese Coastal English or Pigeon English, ) is a pidgin language lexically based on English, but influenced by a Chinese substratum. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, there was also Chinese Pidgin English spoken in Cantonese-speaking portions of China. Chinese Pidgin English is heavily influenced by a number of varieties of Chinese with variants arising among different provinces (for example in Shanghai and Ningbo). A separate Chinese Pidgin English has sprung up in more recent decades in places such as Nauru.\n\nEnglish first arrived in China in the 1630s, when English traders arrived in South China. Chinese Pidgin English was spoken first in the areas of Macao and Guangzhou (City of Canton), later spreading north to Shanghai by the 1830s. \"Yangjing Bang English\" in Chinese (洋涇浜, or 洋泾浜) derives from the name of a former creek in Shanghai near the Bund where local workers communicated with English-speaking foreigners in pidgin (broken English); (Yangjing Bang has since been filled in and is now the eastern part of Yan'an Road, the main east-west artery of central Shanghai).\n\nHistorically, it was a modified form of English developed in the 17th century for use as a trade language or lingua franca between the English and the Chinese. Chinese Pidgin started in Guangzhou, China, after the English established their first trading port there in 1664. Pidgin English was developed by the English and adapted by the Chinese for business purposes. The term \"pidgin\" itself is believed by some etymologists to be a corruption of the pronunciation of the English word \"business\" by the Chinese (see ).\n\nChinese Pidgin continued in use until about the end of the 19th century, when Pidgin came to be looked upon by the Chinese as humiliating (because English speakers considered it ridiculous) and so preferred to learn standard English instead.\n\nChinese Pidgin English began to decline in the late 19th century as standard English began to be taught in the country's education system.\n\nChinese Pidgin English spread to regions beyond the Chinese Coast. Many attestations of the language being spoken come from writings of Western travelers in China. Among these are scattered reports of the pidgin being spoken farther inland, such as in Chungking (Chongqing) and Hankow (Hankou), and farther north, in Kyong Song and even Vladivostok. CPE was also taken beyond China: the large numbers of CPE speakers in Nauru influenced the shaping of Nauruan Pidgin English and there is evidence that it was also taken to Australia, where it altered due to the influence of Australian English and other pidgins. It is also reported to have been spoken in Singapore and Java. Kim (2008) says that there is debate among linguists, including Baker, Mühlhäusler, and himself, about whether or not CPE was taken to California by 19th century immigrants. Many features present in California Chinese Pidgin English overlap with features of CPE, but also overlap with many other pidgins. Furthermore, some diagnostic features of CPE are missing or different from California Chinese Pidgin English. On the other hand, because many migrants came from the Canton province in China, where CPE was relatively well-known, it is likely that many migrants to the United States from China had knowledge of the pidgin. At the very least, it is clear that California Chinese Pidgin English should be treated as a distinct variety from CPE as spoken in Coastal China, because it has morphological and syntactic features not found in CPE.\n\nRobert Hall (1944) gives the following phonemic inventory:\nNative speakers of English use this inventory. Because most lexical items in CPE are derived from English, native English speakers simply use the pronunciation familiar to them. For non-native English speakers, who were largely Cantonese speakers, [v, θ, ð, r, š, ž] are not present, because these sounds are not present in Cantonese.\n\nHall also describes a few morphophonemic alterations. Many verbs ending in consonants may optionally add a vowel, as in [tek(i)] 'to take' and [slip(a)] 'to sleep'. Words ending in [r] and [l], and sometimes [d], optionally omit the final consonant, as in [litə(l)] 'little' and [mo(r)] 'more'. Certain stems also frequently lose their final consonant when before certain suffixes, as in [hwat] 'what?' ([hwasajd] 'where?,' [hwatajm] 'when?,' [hwafæšan] 'how?'), [ðæt] 'that' (ðæsajd 'there'), awt 'out' (awsajd 'outside').\n\nBaker and Mühlhäusler point out that Hall's data was taken entirely from native speakers of English, several decades after CPE was widely used. For this reason, they are skeptical of the data presented. Nonetheless, their own presentation of phonology in CPE is largely the same as Hall's. They state that [s] and [š] were not phonemically contrastive for Cantonese speakers. Words ending in [f] in English often had an added [o] as in \"thiefo\". Aside from these additions, Baker and Mühlhäusler have few revisions to make to the phonological claims Hall made.\n\nThe majority of the words used in CPE are derived from English, with influences from Portuguese, Cantonese, Malay, and Hindi.\n\n\nConstructions in Chinese Pidgin English, both at the phrase level and sentence level, vary widely in taking English or Chinese structure. Generally speaking, pidgin languages have isolating morphology and so do not inflect nouns and verbs; CPE is no exception. Some morphological and syntactic phenomena, which frequently appear in linguistic literature, are listed below.\n\nPrior to 1800, pronouns conformed largely to British and American English paradigms. Over time, \"my\" came to be the only first person singular pronoun in CPE, replacing both \"I\" and \"me\". \"He\" was used for subject and non-subject referents alike (Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 104). Plural pronouns were expressed as in English by native English speakers; we have too little data from native Cantonese speakers to determine if they pluralized pronouns.\n\nIn CPE, once a noun has been explicitly stated, it does not need to be stated again in following sentences where that item would normally be found. This means that in a given sentence, the subject or object may be omitted. In the example below, \"very poor people\" is the subject for the following clauses, although they do not explicitly state it.\nThe omitted noun may also be loosely related to the predicate, rather than a subject or object. In the sentence below, meaning 'He won't sell at that price,' the omitted \"that pricee\" is neither a subject nor an object.\n\nA word derived from English \"have\" was the usual copula in CPE until 1930. It usually appears as \"hab\" or \"hap\". \"Belong\" is also used. After 1830 it became most common to omit the copula entirely.\n'Chinese men are real rogues but that's how it is, can't help it'\n\nThis lexical item seems to have been an influence of Cantonese grammar on CPE. Cantonese uses classifiers on nouns described by a number or demonstrative. The word \"piecee\" is used where Cantonese would expect a classifier. \"Chop\" is another classifier, used only in demonstrative constructions. Places where Cantonese does not use a classifier, as with the words for 'year' and 'dollar,' likewise do not have a classifier in CPE.\n'You will have to engage a lawyer'\n'What is the name of this tea?'\n\nCertain expressions from Chinese English Pidgin have made their way into colloquial English, a process called calque. The following is a list of English expressions which may have been influenced by Chinese.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1972, after being imprisoned and tortured almost to death by the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia, he was allowed to emigrate to West Germany. He lived the remainder of his life there, and resumed his chess career with considerable success, including playing in the Interzonal in 1976 and winning the West German Championship in 1978.\n\nPachman's first chess championship came in 1940, when he became champion of the nearby village of Cista (population 900). The first break in his chess career came in 1943, when he was invited to an international tournament in Prague. World Champion Alekhine dominated the event, with Keres taking second place. Pachman finished ninth in the nineteen-player tournament. Alekhine paid him a compliment in an article in the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" and from the fifth round on, invited him every evening to analyze games and opening variations. \"I don't have to tell you how a beginner from a village chess club felt at that time\", Pachman wrote.\n\nPachman went on to become one of the world's leading players. He was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and the Grandmaster title in 1954. He won fifteen international tournaments, but considered sharing second place in Havana 1963, with Mikhail Tal and Efim Geller, behind Viktor Korchnoi, his best tournament result. Pachman won the Czechoslovak championship seven times between 1946 and 1966. He became the champion of West Germany in 1978. He played in six Interzonal tournaments between Saltsjöbaden 1948 and Manila 1976. He represented Czechoslovakia in eight consecutive Chess Olympiads from 1952 through 1966, usually playing .\nThe most successful year of his career was 1959. After winning the Czechoslovakian championship he went on a South American tour, winning tournaments in Mar del Plata (tied with Miguel Najdorf); Santiago, Chile (tied with Borislav Ivkov); and Lima, Peru (again tied with Ivkov). On this tour he beat the 16-year-old Bobby Fischer twice. Pachman made an even lifetime score against Fischer, +2−2=4.\n\nPachman was politically active throughout his life, first as a Communist and later as a staunch anti-Communist. In December 1968, he won a tournament in Athens. Upon his return to Prague, the authorities arrested, imprisoned, and tortured him for months. During this time he attempted suicide: On Christmas Eve 1969, doctors called his wife and told her that he probably would not survive the night. In 1972, Pachman was finally allowed to emigrate to West Germany. He soon became known as a strongly anti-Communist political activist, and his eloquence made him a regular guest on political talk shows.\n\nPachman was also a prolific author, publishing eighty books in five languages. In the 1950s, he became the world's leading opening expert with the publication of his four-volume opus, \"Theory of Modern Chess\". Pachman considered \"Modern Chess Strategy\", published in 1959, to be his best book. His book \"Checkmate in Prague\" recounts his treatment at the hands of the Communist authorities.\n\n\n\n"}

These agencies earn their income via commission, usually from the deal they make with the model and/or the head agency.\n\nThe top agencies work with big-budget advertising agencies and fashion designers. They invest money into developing their talent so they can increase their status within the industry. These top agencies will help train models, get test shoots, layout portfolios, and put together comp cards (composition photo cards) and other printed materials models need.\n\nThe agencies find work for models by presenting them to designers, photographers, and ad agencies. The agencies are also responsible for booking the jobs, billing for the jobs, and eventually paying the models for their time. By handling the details, an agency allows a model to focus on modeling and not on the business end.\n\nBecause modeling is a very competitive, fast moving business that extends beyond the traditional 9 AM to 5 PM business hours, an agency generally conducts business 24 hours a day, to handle emergencies such as cancellations or rush jobs. Most agencies have a service or an operator to handle emergency issues after hours.\n\nA popular and conventional way for models to build their contacts and get booked for gigs is through model management companies or agencies. An agency specializes in finding gigs for models that are signed with them, while managers are there to guide their models and help them start, develop, and establish successful careers, present models to booking agents, and arrange placements for their models. Mother agents/model managers play a key role in the modeling industry. They provide the constant supply of new faces to booking markets from scouting markets. Most models are from countries like Russia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic, etc. while booking markets are New York, London, Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Shanghai, etc.\n\nMost agencies sign their top talent to exclusive contracts in each market, which vary in length based on the model's industry status and experience. However, because a good agency finds their models work and negotiates top price for their talent, they earn a management commission (between 10% to 20%) from every job they book on a model's behalf. An agency usually bills a client an additional 20% service charge for booking the model, so a typical agency will make between 10-40% on each booking of which no more than 20% comes out of the model's pocket. This varies outside the US due to each country's law and taxes.\nOther contracts offered by modeling agencies are the mother agency contract and a non-exclusive contract. A mother agency tries to sign you with larger agencies in each international market, while non-exclusive agencies allow you to sign with other agencies (usually outside a certain city radius).\nContracts typically last from a year to three years. A mother agency agreement can range from five to ten years.\n\nPoaching is the act of signing a model or agent from another agency while they are still under contract, an act that can be seen as financially detrimental to the agency. Typically, the agency sues the other agency for breach of contract.\n\nHigh fashion modeling agencies contract with a diverse group of models. However, nearly without exception (unless a model is young enough to still be growing), agencies require women to be between 5'9 (minimum) and 6'0\" and men to be between 5'11\" and 6'3\" and in fit or reasonable physical condition for all heights.\n\nModelling agencies will require new faces on a regular basis. The number of models in an agency depends on the demand brought in by its agents and changes throughout the year. To this end, modeling agencies advertise in local phone directories in order to remain visible.\n\nEach new model-screening process is different from one agency to the next:\n\n\nAgents and talent managers work together to prepare and develop models. One of the most important assignment for models is to work or attend fashion shows or fashion weeks.\n\nA fashion show is a runway event put on by fashion designer(s) to showcase their upcoming line of clothing. Each show requires anywhere between 15 and 60 models, depending on the size of the collection and the importance of the designer(s). Fashion models walk the runway (or catwalk) dressed in the clothing created by the designer(s). Participation in these events is essential for any model.\n\nA fashion week is a series of shows by different fashion designers. Each show books their own talent, though many models are able to land jobs with multiple designers. This is a model's chance to really get noticed, which can lead to big contracts and very lucrative jobs. Fashion weeks occur twice a year; one for spring collections and one for fall collections.\n\nThe fashion weeks in major fashion capitals such as New York, Paris, and Milan can have over 100 designers showcasing their work. These weeks are also sponsored by big names, such as Mercedes Benz or Olympus.\n\nModels vie for the prestigious fashion campaigns, where they get to model for a particular designer. One of the most sought-after campaigns is the fragrance campaign, where a model can earn a substantial amount of money.\n\nIn this constantly changing industry where old agencies close or merge and new ones pop up in their place, scam artists have many opportunities to prey on new, unsuspecting models and aspiring models. A legitimate modeling agency should have knowledge of the marketplace and honestly evaluate models for their market. It will have contacts with photographers, graphic designers, and printers to prepare a model's marketing materials. Texas, Florida, and California have online resources listing licensed agencies.\n\nIn the United States, the Better Business Bureau registers complaints against agencies that conduct dishonest business practices and scams. Scam artists and untrustworthy agencies generally demand long-term contracts up front and use high-pressure tactics to con models into committing to high-commission percentages or signing over unnecessary rights.\n\nAn example of a modeling scam is when an agency claims to have work but really what they are doing is trying to sell photoshoots and modeling courses to aspiring models. A legitimate agency should only make profit from agency commissions.\n\nA scam was exposed in 2009, when a Louisville-based male modeling agency called \"Models-Today, LLC\", owned by a convicted felon named Russell Claxon was exposed as having never obtained any jobs for the models despite fees in the hundreds of dollars. Due to the unusually large number of consumer complaints filed against the business, including solicitation for gay male prostitution, this story was disseminated across the Better Business Bureau national networks and provides information on how to avoid such scams. Due to a lack of regulatory oversight in the United States, modelling agency scams can be easily carried out and sustained. Models-Today's owner began operating a similar company called Active Male Models, LLC in Kentucky.\n\n"}

{"id": "2067196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067196", "title": "Podunavlje", "text": "Podunavlje\n\nPodunavlje () is the name of the Danube river basin parts located in Serbia (Vojvodina, Belgrade and Eastern Serbia) and Croatia (Slavonia, Syrmia, and Baranja). Podunavlje is located on the southern edge of Pannonian Basin. In its wider meaning, the Serbo-Croatian term refers to the area around the entire flow of the river Danube.\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, Sava-Danube (Posavina-Podunavlje) section of the Habsburg Military Frontier existed in the area. Podunavlje segment of the Frontier comprised parts of southern Bačka and northern Syrmia including towns of Petrovaradin, Šid, Bačka Palanka, Bački Petrovac, Petrovaradinski Šanac (Novi Sad), and Titel. \nBetween 1922 and 1929, Podunavlje Oblast was one of the administrative units of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It included parts of Šumadija and Banat regions and its seat was in Smederevo. Between 1929 and 1941, one of the provinces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was known as the Danube Banovina. The province consisted of the geographical regions of Syrmia, Bačka, Banat, Baranja, Šumadija, and Braničevo. The capital city of the Danube Banovina was Novi Sad. In 1941, the World War II Axis Powers occupied the province. Bačka and Baranja regions were attached to Miklós Horthy's Hungary, while Syrmia was attached to the Independent State of Croatia. The remaining rump Danube Banovina (including Banat, Šumadija, and Braničevo) existed as part of German-occupied Serbia until the end of 1941 with its capital at Smederevo. Today, Smederevo is seat of the Podunavlje District of Serbia.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, Podunavlje was a name of one of the former seven municipalities of Novi Sad City in Serbia. \n\nEastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1991–1998), the eastern portion of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, was sometimes called 'Podunavska Krajina' by Serbs or 'Croatian Podunavlje' by Croats.\n\nList of cities and towns located on the river Danube in Podunavlje.\n\nCities and towns in Serbia:\n\nCities and towns in Croatia:\n\nList of municipal areas connected to the river Danube in Podunavlje.\n\nMunicipalities in Serbia:\n\nMunicipalities in Croatia:\n\nNorthern part of Serbian Podunavlje is mostly flat, while southern part is mostly mountainous. Important rivers in Serbian Podunavlje that flowing into Danube are Tisa, Sava, Tamiš, and Morava. Two largest cities of Serbia, Belgrade and Novi Sad, are located in Podunavlje. Podunavlje includes parts of several traditional geographical regions in Serbia, such are Bačka, Banat, Syrmia, Šumadija, Braničevo, and Timočka Krajina.\n\nSerbian Podunavlje is mainly populated by Serbs, while other smaller ethnic groups in the area are Slovaks, Hungarians, Croats, Rusyns, Romanians, Vlachs, Roma people, etc. Slovaks forming the majority of population in the municipality of Bački Petrovac, which is located near the Danube, in Bačka. Main religion in the area is Orthodox Christianity, while other smaller religious groups are Catholic Christians, Protestant Christians and Muslims.\n\nPodunavlje region in Serbia was area where several important prehistoric cultures flourished, notably the Lepenski Vir culture, the Starčevo culture, the Vinča culture, the Kostolac culture, the Vatin culture, the Belegiš culture, etc. It was also a core of the Tribal State of Celtic Scordisci, which had its capital in Singidunum (present-day Belgrade). Serbian Podunavlje was also a border region of Roman Empire and there are archaeological remnants of Roman civilization in the area. \n\nIn the Migration Period and the Middle Ages, the region was part of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Hunnic Empire, the Ostrogothic Kingdom, the Kingdom of the Gepids, the Lombard State, the Avar Khaganate, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, the Principality of Pannonian Croatia, the Principality of Lower Pannonia, the Great Moravia, and the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nAlthough, Serbo-Croatian speaking South Slavs settled in Serbian Podunavlje in the 6th century, Serbian state did not reached the river Danube before 13th century. Kingdom of Syrmia ruled by Serb king Stefan Dragutin (1284–1316) included southern Podunavlje and had its capitals in Debrc and Belgrade. The southern Podunavlje was subsequently included into other medieval Serbian states, notably the Serbian Empire, the Moravian Serbia and the Serbian Despotate. The Serbian Despotate had its capitals in Podunavlje, notably in Belgrade and Smederevo. After the Ottoman conquest of Serbian Despotate in 1459, Serbian statehood was temporarily restored in northern Podunavlje (in present-day Vojvodina) between 1526 and 1530, during the reigns of emperor Jovan Nenad and duke Radoslav Čelnik.\n\nIn the 16th century, the whole region was included into the Ottoman Empire. Subsequently, it became an area disputed between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy. After the Treaty of Belgrade from 1739 which defined the Habsburg-Ottoman border in Podunavlje, the region, as well as the local Serb people, became divided between the two empires. In both these areas, Serb people fought for their autonomy and independence. After the First and Second Serbian Uprising (in 1804 and 1815), an autonomous Ottoman Principality of Serbia was created in the south, while after the Serbian Uprising in Vojvodina (in 1848–1849), an autonomous Austrian Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was created in the north. The two autonomous areas, however, did not had the same fate; while the northern voivodeship was abolished in 1860, the southern principality gained full independence in 1878 and was transformed into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882. In 1918, after the Habsburg defeat in the First World War, the northern Podunavlje was also included into the Kingdom of Serbia, which subsequently became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). Since 2006, the whole region is part of an independent Republic of Serbia.\n\nIn Croatia, region is elongated in a north-south along the Danube which is border river between Croatia and Serbia. On the north region bordering with Hungary and on west continues to Slavonia, Syrmia and Baranja and rest of Croatia. The region is extremely flat with an average altitude of 80–110 meters. Coendures of Croatian Podunavlje are approximately overlapping with the territory of pre-War territory of Yugoslav municipalities Beli Manastir, Osijek, Vinkovci and Vukovar. Those four municipalities had a territory of 3.436 kilometres and constituted 6,1% of territory of Socialist Republic of Croatia. In 1991 mentioned municipalities had 402.152 inhabitants living in 157 settlements and they constituted 8,4% of population of Croatia at the time. After the collapse of Yugoslavia, local government system in Croatia was significantly changed and today Croatian Podunavlje in widest sense can be described as a region that is overlapping with the territory of Vukovar-Srijem and Osijek-Baranja counties. In this sense region include the gravitation regions of towns of Našice and Županja and is significantly bigger and cover the area of 6.597 kilometres or 11,7% of territory of Croatia with 348 settlements and 598.434 inhabitants in 1991 (12,5% of total population of Croatia at that time).\n\nClimate in the region can be described as Continental climate with warm and hot summers and cold winters. Temperature ranges in Podunavlje are higher than in rest of Croatia due to the continent influence. Also level of rainfall is therefore lower than in the rest of Croatia.\n\nIt is one of the ethnically heterogeneous areas in Croatia. The largest ethnic group are Croats, after them follow Serbs and Hungarians, as well as some smaller ethnic groups such as Pannonian Rusyns, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Romani people, Germans, etc. Croats constitute an absolute majority of people in Podunavlje, while Serbs make up largest ethnic minority. Hungarians are third ethnic group by number and mostly live in area of Baranja. Pannonian Rusyns live mainly in Petrovci and Mikluševci. More than one-fifth of total number of Slovaks in country live in Ilok.\n\nSome of the important archaeological cultures that appeared in this area are the Vučedol culture, the Vinča culture and the Starčevo culture. Certainly, the most famous archaeological artifact is the ritual vessel of Vučedol culture, called by the speculative attribution of her founder (in 1938) M. Seper – the Vučedol Dove (vučedolska golubica). Made between 2800 and 2500 B.C. it became the symbol of style, culture and new arising European civilization. The Vučedol dove is a 19,5 cm high ritual vessel made from baked clay. This, as well, proves European pigeon breeding much older than we used to think. Moreover, Vučedol dove is the oldest dove figure found in Europe so far. The ritual vessel is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 20 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2001.\n\nDuring the Roman period, Danube was border to barbarian world.\nIn period from 1991 till 1998 in Podunavlje there was self-proclaimed Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia that was reintegrated into Croatia after signing of Erdut Agreement. Region was declared by local Serbs who promoted survival of Yugoslavia, because of which they had support of Yugoslav People's Army. Local Serb population was further alarmed with comparisons of new Croatian state with World War II Independent State of Croatia and its Jasenovac concentration camp. War has left a heavy mark on both the economy and the interpersonal relationships in region. There were especially strained relations between two largest groups, Croats and Serbs. \n\nSome of the most important events of war in eastern Croatia are Battle of Vukovar, Vukovar massacre, and Borovo Selo killings in which in first two cases was killed significant number of civilians. Large part of Croats were forced to leave their homes in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia, and their property was looted and destroyed. Some have been captured and imprisoned for some time in Serbia, and some were killed there. Tens of thousands of Croats in this period left Podunavlje. At the same time in Podunavlje came tens of thousands Serbian refugees fleeing from war in the rest of Croatia. After the war ended local population get a difficult task of rebuilding coexistence in which were included a number of organizations such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and embassies of foreign countries. However, although progress is slow at times international community has assessed this process as relatively successful.\n\nKopački Rit:\n\nNature park Kopački Rit is located northwest of the confluence of the Drava and the Danube, situated at the border with Serbia. It is one of the most important, largest and most attractive preserved intact wetlands in Europe. Around 260 various bird species nest here (wild geese and ducks, great white egret, white stork, black stork, white-tailed eagle, crows, coots, gulls, terns, kingfishers, European green woodpecker, etc.), and there are many other species using this area as a temporary shelter on migration from the northern, cooler regions to the southern, warmer areas and vice versa.\n\nThere are 40-odd fish species (pike, ide, tench, bream, carp, catfish, pike-perch, perch, etc.). Several various mammal species inhabit the land (red deer, roe deer, wild boar, wild cat, pine marten, stone marten, weasel, sable, otter, etc.) Rich plant life, typical of wetlands, is found also in Kopački Rit.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2067198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067198", "title": "Talent agent", "text": "Talent agent\n\nA talent agent, or booking agent, is a person who finds jobs for actors, authors, film directors, musicians, models, professional athletes, writers, screenwriters, broadcast journalists, and other professionals in various entertainment or broadcast businesses. In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are modeling agencies, commercial talent agencies, literary agencies, voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more.\n\nHaving an agent is not required, but does help the artist in getting jobs (concerts, tours, movie scripts, appearances, signings, sport teams, etc.). In many cases, casting directors or other businesses go to talent agencies to find the artists for whom they are looking. The agent is paid a percentage of the star's earnings (typically 10%). Therefore, agents are sometimes referred to as \"10 percenters\". Various regulations govern different types of agents. The regulations are established by artist's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates. There are also professional associations of talent agencies.\n\nTalent agents are considered gatekeepers to their client's careers. They have the ability to reshape and reconstruct their client's image. They are dealmakers and assist their client by orchestrating deals within the entertainment industry, more specifically in the Hollywood entertainment industry. \n\nIn California, because talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts, the agencies must be licensed under special sections of the California Labor Code, which defines an agent as a \"person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for an artist or artists.\"\n\nMajor talent agencies include Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency, and ICM Partners.\n\nSome talent agencies specialize in the representation of television news broadcast journalists and television news magazine hosts. The journalists and hosts represented by these agents primarily work at television stations in local markets or at networks. There are many job titles for broadcast news journalists such as anchors, reporters, weathercasters, sportscasters, correspondents and hosts.\n\nActors may be interested in working theatrically (stage, film or television) as well as in commercials. Some agents will handle all types of acting work, while others may specialize in a particular area. Some agents work only in the field of television, or only in film and television. Typically, the larger the agency, the more specialized the agents within the agency.\n\nAn agent has two sets of clients: the \"talent\" (actors, models, voice-over artists, etc.) and the \"buyer\". The buyer can be a casting director, advertising agency, production company, photographer, or direct client if the client has an \"in-house\" production staff. Agents promote talent to the buyers, submitting talent who have the appropriate age, race, sex, look, talent, etc. that the buyer is seeking for his/her project. Usually, an agent submits the actor's head shot or the model's composite card or portfolio to the buyer. After the buyer has made choices, the agent then arranges an audition (or for models, a \"go-see\" or open call). After the buyer has met the talent, the buyer will contact the agent if any of the talent will be hired. The agent will coordinate the details of wardrobe, directions, etc., as well as negotiate the contract or pay.\n\nNote that the agent's job is to get the talent auditions; the talent is the only person who can get the job. For their work, agents take a 10 to 20% commission of the gross, depending on whether the job is union (such as SAG-AFTRA) or not. Union jobs are paid per negotiated guidelines, but in non-union jobs the pay is sometimes delayed.\n\nA well established agent will have networks upon networks of contacts. Also, agents have access to professional casting services. Many of these casting resources are not available to the general public.\n\nAlthough most of the successful agents are private individuals unknown to the public, some are celebrities in their own right. Notable current and former talent agents includes David Begelman, Ari Emanuel, Freddie Fields, Johnny Hyde, Irving \"Swifty\" Lazar, Sue Mengers, Quincy Sims, Lew Wasserman, Jadin Wong and The Handbook.\n\nIn the music world, booking agents are different from talent managers. Booking agents are the people who actually book shows for the artists they represent. These agents make all of the arrangements with the promoters of the shows. The booking agent presents the promoter or producer of the concert with a performance agreement, which stipulates the artist's requirements. Items may include lighting, sound, meals, hotel accommodations, and transportation. For concert buyers, they work to find the artist who will fit in the need and available budget.\n\nMany of the major booking agencies refuse to represent clients who are not already signed to a major record label and have national distribution of their music. Because of this, artists on independent record labels often seek representation with an independent booking agency.\n\nBars and nightclubs that specialize in presenting live music on a regular basis often employ an individual to assemble the schedule of events. This individual is the venue's buyer, and should not be confused with the booking agent, who presents a roster of available acts to the buyer. Booking agents may also have contacts known as free-lance promoters. These are individuals who agree to produce a concert by locating a venue, providing a sound system and assembling a staff. Producing a show in this manner, at a location rented out for a single evening, is called “four-walling,” as the process entails renting a venue and receiving no additional services or technical equipment other than the space itself. This has often been the only available option for underground musicians lacking enough popular appeal to gain access to more conventional performance venues (see: Punk rock), but is also used among the genre of raves and various DJ-related events.\n\nThe cost factor of having a booking agent must be weighed against what the agent can do for clients and buyers alike. Some agents represent several different types of artists, while others represent artists in one main area/genre.\n\nSome music agencies deal exclusively with cover bands, listing exclusive and non-exclusive artists on their rosters. In addition, some agencies will also work with a third party company to build specific bands using their own database of vetted musicians, whilst other cover band agencies work with session musicians, that provide a 'flexible' line up for each act.\n\nBooking agents are also used for the cruise ship industry where several different categories of entertainers are needed. These can include individual musicians to be part of the ship's orchestra, small bands and ensembles as well as variety entertainers such as singers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians and acrobats. Artists looking to work on cruise ships will sign an employment contract with the cruise line and a separate commission contract with the booking agent. The agent will usually be based in the country of origin for the artist.\n\nA music manager (or band manager) handles many career issues for bands, singers, record producers, and DJs. A music manager is hired by a musician or band to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotions, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers is extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, business manager (who is sometimes a certified public accountant), tour managers, and sometimes even a personal assistant. Responsibilities of a business manager are often divided among many individuals who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers must assume multiple roles: booking agent, graphic designer, publicist, promoter, and accountant. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities grow. A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding music producers, and developing relationships with record companies, publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. The duties of an active music manager will focus on developing a reputation for the musician and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, and booking shows. A music manager will gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.\n\nWith the advent of the internet, established and new talent can have a thriving career in the voice over industry through online casting websites. Whilst there are sites that allow any person to join, a new wave of 'professionals only' casting websites is emerging. In an industry where radio and television voice overs can be recorded in home studios because of technology becoming so affordable, high paying jobs are no longer sourced exclusively through traditional voice talent agents.\n\nSince the decline in viewership in theaters, from the 1950s to 1960s, a monumental shift occurred in how studios produced films and reduced the cost of exclusive and expensive actors. After the shift, actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity, and so were able to work with other studios. This shift has meant that agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option. Agents became third parties who negotiated between studios and clients, making the need for the agents' services an imperative for each party.\n\nIn the 1980s new agencies were established to compete with the \"Big five.\" In 1991 Bauer-Benedek merged with Leading Artists Agency to form what became United Talent Agency. These agencies were Traid Artists and InterTalent. Traid Artist would eventually be sold to William Morris Agency in 1992, and InterTalent would diminish when its partners dispersed between UTA and ICM in the same year.\n\nThe difference between the roles of agents and managers has become smaller and more blurred. A frequent definition of the role of a talent manager is to \"oversee the day-to-day business affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career.\" Considerable overlap exists as talent agents may opt to fill exactly the same roles for their clients out of a financial interest in developing the careers of their talent and currying their favor.\n\nVarious state laws and labor guild rules govern the roles reserved to agents, as well as specifying certain special rights, privileges, and prohibitions. In the state of California, the labor code requires licensing of talent agencies and includes regulations such as criminal background checks, maintaining separate operating accounts and client trust accounts, and limits total commissions to twenty-five percent, among other regulations. In contrast, management companies are described as \"often unregulated.\" Agents also have certain privileged powers in situations of verbal agreement and can legally agree to a binding employment offer on behalf of their client.\n\nA prominent difference between agents and managers under California state law is that licensed talent agents and employment agents are the only entities legally allowed to seek work on behalf of their clients. This legal distinction has enabled artists such as the Deftones, Pamela Anderson, Nia Vardalos, Freddie Prinze Jr., and others to break contracts with their managers and avoid commissions owed according to those contracts by proving \"unlicensed procurement\" in court. Because the enforcement against talent managers procuring work is largely carried out through civil litigation and not criminal penalties, managers directly seek out work in defiance of state laws, as clients out of self-interest will seldom object to them doing so and cases alleging illegal procurement are infrequent.\n\nThe Writer's Guild, Screen Actor's Guild, and Director's Guild, among labor guilds, strike agency franchise agreements that specify certain regulations and privileges reserved solely for agents including setting maximum commissions at ten percent of a talent's gross earnings. Managers do not face the same restrictions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2067201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067201", "title": "Cameroonian Pidgin English", "text": "Cameroonian Pidgin English\n\nCameroonian Pidgin English, or Cameroonian Creole, is a language variety of Cameroon. It is also known as Kamtok (from 'Cameroon-talk'). It is primarily spoken in the North West and South West English speaking regions. Five varieties are currently recognised:\n\n\nCameroonian Pidgin English is an English-based creole language. About 5% of Cameroonians are native speakers of the language, while an estimated 50% of the population speak it in some form. \n\nThe terms \"Cameroonian Pidgin\", \"Cameroonian Pidgin English\", \"Cameroonian Creole\" and \"Kamtok\" are synonyms for what Cameroonians call Cameroon Pidgin English. Many speakers are unaware that this language is different from Standard English. It is a variety of West African Pidgin Englishes spoken along the coast from Ghana to Cameroon. It is a vehicular language that has been in active use in the country for over 200 years. It came into being in the Slave Trade Years (1440 to early 1800s). It preceded English in Cameroon: the first Baptist missionaries who arrived in Cameroon in 1845 and introduced formal education in English, had to learn Pidgin. A few decades later during the German annexation period (1884–1914), Pidgin resisted a German ban. It took flight when it became a makeshift language used in German plantations and undertakings by forced labourers who were drawn from the hinterland and who spoke different indigenous languages. With time it passed into use in the market place, and was adopted by Baptist missionaries as the language of their evangelical crusade. For many years, it has been used on school playgrounds and campuses and in political campaigns, and today it is forcing its way into spoken media. (For a comprehensive description of its linguistic features and its place in the language ecology of Cameroon, see amongst others, Kouega 2007 and 2008).\n\nLike most West African languages, Kamtok has seven vowels, with two mid vowels: open and closed (Schneider 1966:14-17). Schneider spells the mid vowels as closed \"ey\" and \"ow\" vs. open \"e\" and \"o\" but Todd spells them as closed \"e\" and \"o\" vs. open \"eh\" and \"oh\".\n\nThe palatal approximate is written \"y\", the palatal affricates and are written \"ch\" and \"j\", and the palatal and velar nasals and are written \"ny\" and \"ng\" (Schneider 1966:12-14). Some of these consonants, such as and , are not distinguished by speakers who lack such distinctions in their local substrate languages (1966:225-229).\n\n\nThe basic pronoun system of Kamtok distinguishes three persons and two numbers. In most cases, the shape of the pronoun does not change to show grammatical function. Two exceptions involve the first person singular, where \"a\" serves as a subject clitic on verbs, as in \"mi, a mos go\" 'I must go', and \"ma\" is the possessive pronoun, as in \"ma beli\" 'my stomach'. The other major exception is \"-am\" in place of \"i\" or \"dem\" as an object suffix on verbs, except when the referent is human, as in \"a go was-am\" 'I'll wash it'. (Schneider 1966:64-68). Acrolectal speakers, however, are more likely to use \"dei\" for \"dem\" in subject position and \"ohs\" for \"wi\" in object position (Todd, n.d.).\n\nVerbs are not inflected to show grammatical tense, aspect, modality, or negation. Instead, these notions are conveyed by a small set of preverbal auxiliaries (Schneider 1966:69-72, 95-104).\n\nExamples:\nThe rendition of a short passage from English to Cameroon Pidgin:\n\nEnglish language:\nCameroon Pidgin:\nIn pidgin unlike in English, 'S' is not used at the end of nouns to mark their plural state. Instead, this is what is used:\n\n\n"}

The Joe Hill House was then located to 1462 S 4th W, two blocks away from the Vitro smokestack. Just before the death of Ammon Hennacy it was closed by the Utah Migrant Council.\n\n"}
{"id": "2067207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067207", "title": "Kolkata Metro", "text": "Kolkata Metro\n\nThe Kolkata Metro is a rapid transit system serving the Kolkata in the Indian state of West Bengal. The network currently consists of two operational lines of from Noapara to Kavi Subhash and of from Salt Lake Sector V to Salt Lake Stadium (total ) with four other lines in various phases of construction. The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. Kolkata Metro operates between 05:45 and 21:55 hours, and the fares ranges between Rs. 5 to 30.\n\nThe Kolkata Metro was the first planned and operational rapid transit system in India. Initially planned in 1920s and construction started in 1970s, the first elevated stretch from Bhawanipore (now Netaji Bhawan) to Esplanade opened in 1984. The Line 2 or East-West corridor opened in 2020. It is the fifth-longest operational metro network in India after the Delhi Metro, Hyderabad Metro, Chennai Metro and Namma Metro. \n\nMetro Railway, Kolkata and Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation are the owners and operator of the system. On 29 December 2010, Metro Railway, Kolkata became the 17th zone of the Indian Railways, completely owned and funded by the Ministry of Railways. It is the only metro in the country to be controlled by Indian Railways. The total number of trips per day is 284, and carrying more than 700,000 passengers daily.\n\nAn East-West metro railway connection, named \"East-West tube railway” for Kolkata was proposed in 1921 by Harley Dalrymple-Hay during the British Raj, but it was ultimately not undertaken due to a lack of funds in 1923. Although initial efforts were made in 1919. In the September session of the Imperial Legislative Council of that year at Shimla, a committee was set up by Sir W E Crum, that recommended a metro line for Kolkata. This line was supposed to connect Bagmari in east and Benaras Road, Salkia in Howrah in the west, via a tunnel beneath Hooghly River. The construction costs estimated were £3,526,154, about Rs 4.28 crore (based on current exchange rates), and the proposed deadline was 1925–26. The proposed line, long (about shorter than the current East-West Corridor) would connect East Bengal Railway in Bagmari and Indian Railways in Benaras Road. He also mentioned a north-south line back then. All the reports can be found in his book \"Calcutta Tube Railways,\" published by Robt. J. Cook & Hammond in 1921. The tickets were priced at 3 annas (Rs. 0.1875) for the full trip.\n\nThe then Chief Minister of West Bengal, Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy, reconceived the idea of building an Underground Railway for Kolkata in the early 1950s. A survey was done by a team of French experts, but nothing concrete came of this. Efforts to solve the problem by augmenting the existing fleet of public transport vehicles hardly helped, since roads accounted for only 4.2% of the surface area in Kolkata, compared with 25% in Delhi and even 30% in other cities. To find alternative solutions to alleviate the suffering of commuters, the Metropolitan Transport Project (MTP) was set up in 1969. The MTP, with help of Soviet specialists, Lenmetroproekt and East German engineers, prepared a master plan to provide five rapid-transit (metro) lines for the city of Kolkata, totaling a route length of in 1971. However, only three were selected for construction. These were:\n\n\nOf these, the highest priority was given to the busy north-south corridor between Dum Dum and Tollygunge over a length of , and the work on this project was sanctioned on 1 June 1972. Although a tentative deadline was fixed to complete all the corridors by 1991.\n\nIn being the country's first metro and constructed as a completely indigenous process, traditional Cut and Cover method and Driven Shield Tunneling was chosen and the Kolkata Metro was more of a trial-and-error affair, in contrast to the Delhi Metro, which has also seen the involvement of numerous international consultants. As a result, it took nearly 23 years to completely construct a underground railway.\n\nThe foundation stone of the project was laid by Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, on 29 December 1972 and the construction work started in 1973–74. In those early days of Kolkata Metro, the project was led by the then Union Railway Minister from West Bengal – A. B. A. Ghani Khan Choudhury – often against (and to the chagrin of) the prevailing socio-political stance of his contemporaries in the West Bengal government. From the start of construction, the project had to contend with several problems including insufficient funds (until 1977–78), a shifting of underground utilities, court injunctions, and an irregular supply of vital materials. Despite the difficulties faced, services began on 24 October 1984, with the commissioning of a partial commercial service covering a distance of with five stations served in between Esplanade and Bhowanipur (currently Netaji Bhavan). The first metro was driven by Tapan Kumar Nath and Sanjoy Sil. The service was quickly followed by commuter services on another stretch in the north between Dum Dum and Belgachhia on 12 November 1984. The commuter service was extended up to Tollygunge on 29 April 1986 covering a further distance of making the service available over a distance of and covering 11 stations. However, the services on the north section were suspended with effect from 26 October 1992, as this isolated small section was little used.\n\nAfter a gap of more than eight years, the Belgachhia-Shyambazaar section, along with the Dum Dum-Belgachhia stretch, was opened on 13 August 1994. Another stretch from Esplanade to Chandni Chowk was commissioned shortly afterwards, on 2 October 1994. The Shyambazaar-Shobhabazar-Girish Park () and Chandni Chowk-Central () sections were opened on 19 February 1995. Services on the entire stretch of the Metro were introduced from 27 September 1995 by bridging the vital gap of in the middle.\n\nIn the year 1999-2000, the extension of Line 1 to an elevated corridor from Tollygunge to New Garia, with 6 stations, was sanctioned at a cost of . The section was constructed and opened in two phases, Mahanayak Uttam Kumar to Kavi Nazrul in 2009 and Kavi Nazrul to Kavi Subhash in 2010. The latest extension opened was the stretch from Dum Dum to Noapara on 10 July 2013.\n\nThe master-plan of the pre-independence metro corridor was made in 1971, along with the North-South corridor, connecting the office district Bidhannagar with the twin city and transportation hub Howrah, via another transport hub of the city, Sealdah and central business district Esplanade, by an underwater metro line. It is a project, sanctioned in the year 2008, by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The West Bengal government had earlier appointed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited to conduct a feasibility study of the project, after which the government had to then put the project on hold due to funding issues. The foundation stone was laid on 22 February 2009 and the construction of line 2 started in March 2009. An autonomous body named Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) was formed to implement the project. Government of India (Ministry of Urban Development) and Government of West Bengal had 50-50 shares in it. Later Govt. of West Bengal pulled out from it, and the shares were transferred to Ministry of Railways. \n\nChief Minister Mamata Banerjee proposed the realignment of the East-West Metro corridor, from Central to Esplanade in 2012, stating that the original plan would affect 250 shop-owners and tenants in the Lalbazar and Bowbazar area. The residents and traders of those areas started protests. KMRC and JICA requested the Government of West Bengal to stick to the original plan otherwise, it might take a toll on the entire project. This was the first time in the country that a metro corridor alignment was being changed after preparation of DPR and sanction of the project. Despite opposition from the official agencies, Govt of West Bengal forcefully approved the route realignment. This changed the location of Mahakaran metro station and increased the length of the corridor by . A lot of political controversies were created regarding this. Later KMRC also said that the realignment would further increase the ridership and revenue by at least 30%.\n\nBy 2011-12, the Railway Ministry announced plans for the construction of five new metro lines and an extension of the existing North-South corridor. These were:\n\n\n\nLine 1 or the North-South Line has a total length of serving 24 stations of which 15 are underground, 9 are elevated and 2 at-grade. It uses of Indian gauge, a broad gauge rolling stock. It was the first underground railway to be built in India, with the first trains running in October 1984 and the full stretch that had been initially planned was completed and operational by February 1995. The southward extension of Line 1 to an elevated corridor from Tollygunge to New Garia was constructed and opened in two phases, Mahanayak Uttam Kumar to Kavi Nazrul in 2009 and Kavi Nazrul to Kavi Subhash in 2010. The latest extension constructed was the 2.59 km elevated corridor from Dum Dum to Noapara in 2013. \n\nNorthward extension of Metro from Dum Dum up to Dakshineshwar (6.20 km) was sanctioned and included in Budget of 2010–11 at a cost of The commercial operations Dum Dum to Noapara (2.09 km) was commissioned in March 2013 and construction from Noapara to Dakshineshwar having an interchange with Line 5 at Baranagar (2.38 km) is being executed by RVNL. This section is expected to open November 2020 with a projected ridership of 55000 by 2030.\n\nSignal Upgrade: Up-gradation of existing signalling system, from Indian Railways Signalling to Communication Based Train Control was proposed by Metro Railway, Kolkata at a cost of and was sent to Indian Railways, so that time interval between trains can be decreased to just 90 seconds, from 5 minutes. Railways gave a go ahead to the proposal, and installation work is expected to be complete within 2–3 years.\n\nEast-West Metro, is a project to connect Kolkata with Howrah by an underwater metro line, below the Hooghly river, was given the go-ahead by the central government. The length was supposed to be 14.67 km (8.9 km underground and 5.77 km elevated). A separate body named Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) is the implementing agency of the project. Currently, the East-West Metro's majority stake is with the Indian Railways and the remainder is with Ministry of Urban Development and as a loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.In August 2019 the line's operations were handed over to Metro Railway, Kolkata.\n\nThe construction of line 2 started in March 2009. However, the project was stalled several times due to land acquisition and slum relocation issues. A major realignment was done in June 2016 which increased the length to 16.55 km (10.81 km underground, 5.77 km elevated). The originally planned intersection with line 1 at Central was re-aligned to Esplanade (interchange with line 1 and line 3). In September 2019, during the construction of the eastbound tunnel (from Esplanade to Sealdah), a TBM hit an aquifer under Bowbazar, causing a major collapse in the area, thus halting and delaying the work of that section for several months. All these caused massive delays to the project, and foreign currency losses had led to an 80% cost escalation of the project to nearly .\n\nBetween Mahakaran and Howrah Station, the metro will run under the Hooghly River – the first underwater metro in India. The line will be elevated between Salt Lake Sector 5 and Salt Lake Stadium and the remaining stretch will be underground. Transfer stations with railways will be located at Sealdah and Howrah. A new elevated extension from Salt Lake Sector V to Teghoria (Haldiram) has been sanctioned, a distance of 5.5 km at a budget of . From Teghoria (Haldiram), the passengers can take the Line 6 metro (VIP Road Station) to Biman Bandar. The stations in the new extension are:\n\n\nThe line was inaugurated on 13 February 2020, from Salt Lake Sector-V to Salt Lake Stadium, by Minister of Railways, Piyush Goyal, after 11 years from the beginning of construction.\n\nPreviously, the stretch, from Thakurpukur to Majerhat was surveyed as a branch line of the circular railway. And a metro line from Majerhat to Dakshineshwar, via Sealdah (interchange with Line 2) was planned. Although, the plan was scrapped later and a new metro line from further south in Joka to BBD Bagh, was sanctioned in 2010–11 of total length 16.72 km at an anticipated cost of . But, later the route was truncated till Esplanade. The corridor runs along Diamond Harbour Road, Khidirpur Road and Jawaharlal Nehru Road which are major arterial roads of Kolkata and has passenger interchange facilities with the Line 1 at Esplanade station. The line will have a new depot in Joka. Due to land acquisition problems, the construction had delayed several times, since 2017. The work resumed in several phases and new bids were invited by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) in April 2020. The extension of this line to IIM and Diamond Park for 2 km has been sanctioned in the Budget of 2012–13 at a cost of . The execution of this work has been entrusted to RVNL.\n\nThe line has 3 phases:\n\n\nThe proposed Esplanade station will not be the same as that of Line 1 but a completely different station which will also serve Line 2. The Mominpur metro station was planned to build across a 2500 sq. km area. But, Ministry of Defence objected the elevated structure, saying that it would overlook the Ordnance depot. This issue forced RVNL to stall the entire project, and a point of time, RVNL almost dropped off the station from the plan. alone had the projection of 20,000 passengers during peak hours. After a series of discussions and consultations with Ministry of Defence and Govt. of West Bengal, the material modification was done and the station was shifted around 1 km northward, near the Alipore Bodyguard Lines. It will be the last elevated station of the corridor.\n\nThe work of integration of the line of Circular Railway from Dum Dum Cantt. to Biman Bandar along with construction of new line from Noapara to Dum Dum Cantt. for 6.249 km line was sanctioned and included in the budget of 2010–11. The cost of the project is Eastward extension from Biman Bandar to Barasat for 10.627 km was sanctioned and included in the budget of 2010–11. The cost of the project is . The execution of this project from Noapara to Barasat is being done by Metro Railway, Kolkata. Due to multiple delays and hurdles, the total cost of the project had been escalated to Rs 4829.57 crore.\n\nFollowing the objection from AAI, the route was further reworked. Instead of using the Circular Line's Jessore Road and Biman Bandar railway station, Jessore Road and Biman Bandar metro station were planned at-grade and underground respectively. And this stretch will continue underground till New Barrackpore, Another station was proposed at Michael Nagar. In January 2020, bids for geotechnical works were invited.\n\nThe Baranagar-Barrackpore Line is the northward extension from Baranagar to Barrackpore (12.40 km) was sanctioned at a cost of in the budget of 2010–11. This line was meant to enable a quick commute from the northernmost suburbs to South Kolkata. The work corridor is being executed by RVNL. As of May 2020, no physical construction has commenced, and the project has been stalled as metro construction would affect the water pipelines along Barrackpore Trunk Road. To avoid this, another proposal was made to continue this line through the Kalyani Expressway. Eleven metro stations were planned on this route.\n\nA connection between New Garia and the Airport (29.87 km) via EM Bypass, Saltlake and Rajarhat-New Town has started; it will help to reduce travel time between the southern fringes of Kolkata to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. The work on this New Garia-Dum Dum Airport line was inaugurated by Mamata Banerjee on 7 February 2011 with a project deadline of six years. The link between Kavi Subhash and Biman Bandar, to be set up at a cost of Rs 4 billion, will have 24 stations with the terminal Airport station being an underground one. Biman Bandar metro station will also have a stabling yard, and will be the largest underground facility in the country. This line will have interchanges at Kavi Subhash (with Line 1); Salt Lake Sector V (with Line 2) and Teghoria/VIP Road (again with Line 2).\n\nInitially, the Biman Bandar metro station was planned to be elevated. But, Airports Authority of India objected that the elevated stretch upto Biman Bandar might pose a threat to aircraft. Following the objection from AAI, the route was further reworked. and the station was shifted underground, 150 m from the Airport Terminal building. This will the only underground station in the whole corridor.\n\nIn 2012, RITES, surveyed 16 new routes for connecting the suburban areas to the city. The key routes were:\n\n\nThe system operates between 06:45 and 21:55 hours. There are a total of 358 services everyday. Trains operate at an average speed of 5560 km/h and stop for about 10 to 20 seconds at each station, depending upon the crowd. All the stations have display boards showing terminating station, current time, scheduled time of arrival and estimated time of arrival of trains in Bangla, Hindi and English. Digital countdown clocks are also present in the stations. All the coaches have respective line route-maps and speakers & displays, which show and announce details of upcoming stations in the three languages. Navigation information is available on Google Maps.\n\nIn 2008, the Kolkata Metro Railway experimented with the practice of reserving two entire compartments for women. This system was found to be ineffective and caused inconvenience for a lot of commuters (including women) and the plan was eventually dropped by the metro authority. \n\nNow, a certain section of seats in each of the compartments is reserved for women, senior citizens and physically challenged. The 4 seat sections at each end of the coach are reserved for senior citizens and physically challenged. And the 2 middle seat sections, between the general seat sections on each side, are reserved for women.\n\nThe fare is based on the pre-determined distance-slabs. Unlike the other metros in the country, Kolkata Metro has the lowest fare of Rs. 5,\n\nLine 1\n\nThe following is the revised zones and fare for a single journey tokens as well as for a Smart Card w.e.f. 5 December 2019.\n\nLine 2\n\nThe following is the zones and fare for a single journey tokens as well as for a Smart Card w.e.f. 15 February 2019.\n\nAfter using the magnetic ticketing strip system for 27 years from 1984 to 2011, Kolkata Metro introduced Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tokens by Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS), in partnership with Keltron from August 2011. The old magnetic strip reader gates were replaced by new RFID readers.\n\nAfter introducing RFID tokens, Kolkata metro introduced a Smart Card service introduced by Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS). Earlier, 4 different types of smart cards, i.e. Minimum Multi Ride (MMR), Limited Multi Ride (LMR), General Multi Ride (GMR) and Extended Multi Ride (EMR) were used. They were withdrawn w.e.f. 7 November 2013 and a single type of Smart Card (General Smart Card) was introduced. Two new types of Tourist Smart Cards were also introduced (Tourist Smart Card – I and Tourist Smart Card – II). There is a compulsory refundable security deposit of Rs. 60. The card is common for both Line 1 and 2.\n\nGeneral Smart Card (for Line 1)\n\nStore Value Card (for Line 2)\n\nTourist Smart Card\n\nThese type of smart cards, are for tourists, having unlimited rides. One can buy them at a cost of ₹250, valid for a day and ₹550, valid for three days. Security deposit of ₹60 is charged extra.\n\nThe metro railway runs special night-long services during the Durga Puja (Mahasaptami to Mahanavami), to help people travel faster and conveniently for pandal-hopping. The services start from 13:00 hours and operate till 04:00 hours the next day. Pre-puja services are also run.\n\nAll stations are equipped with closed-circuit cameras, metal detectors and baggage scanners, making the metro one of the safest form of transport in Kolkata. Railway Protection Force provides security in the premises. Smoking is strictly prohibited in the metro premises. All the stations in East-West line have half-height and full-height platform screen doors for elevated and underground stations respectively.\n\nAll the stations have televisions which telecast news and songs. WiFi facility was introduced at Park Street and Maidan metro station in 2016. Gradually it was expanded to all the stations. One can access the WiFi by logging in with their phone number. The service is provided by Reliance Jio. \n\nMost of the stations have services such as ATMs, food outlets, chemist stalls etc. facilities. To ease off the crowd for recharging smart cards, two Automatic Card  recharge machines were installed at Dum Dum. On account of the Swachhta–Hi–Seva, a nationwide awareness and mobilization campaign on cleanliness, plastic bottle crushers were placed at multiple stations.\n\nKolkata Metro is the busiest metro system in India based on passengers carried per service. Each service carries an average of 2,465 people, while Delhi carries 1,111. Presently Kolkata Metro carries around 7 lac people daily. The daily and annual ridership is always on the rise since 1984. And after the completion of the whole corridor from Dum Dum to Mahanayak Uttam Kumar, in 1995, saw a huge leap in ridership count. Low fares, fast and convenient travel has contributed to the high ridership figures. During 2019 Durga Puja, metro saw record ridership of 9.22 lacs.\n\nThe newly inaugurated Line 2 sees around 10 thousand people daily.\n\nThe rolling stock of Kolkata Metro Line 1 uses Indian gauge a broad gauge track which is manufactured by Integral Coach Factory, Chennai (ICF), and the electrical components are manufactured by NGEF, Bangalore. Initially, the rolling stock fleet was composed of 4-car rakes. Over the years there has been considerable expansion to the network, both underground and on elevated sections. With the increase in traffic, 8-car rake formation has become a standard for the Kolkata Metro.\n\nPresently, there are 4 operational depots. The Noapara, Tollygunge and New Garia depot serve the North-South line. While the Central Park depot serves East-West line. One more depot at Joka for Line 3 and a yard at Airport for Line 4 are under construction.\n\nKolkata metro has 30 stations, 21 of which are underground, 7 are elevated and 2 stations are at grade. All the underground stations have island platforms except Park Street which has side platforms. While all the elevated stations have side platforms, Noapara has island platforms and since it will be the hub station for Line 1 and Line 4 it has 4 platforms having a length of 182 m. The standard length of platforms in Kolkata Metro is 170 m. The metro stations of Gitanjali & Netaji have the shortest platforms of 163 m. The average length between any two stations is 1.14 km. The shortest distance is 0.597 km between Central and Chandni Chowk, whereas the longest distance is 2.15 km between Dum Dum and Belgachia. Since the electrification of Kolkata metro is of the 3rd Rail, 750 V DC, electricity substations were built in Jatin Das Park, Central, Shyambazar. The type of tracks are ballast-less with M1A track fittings.\n\nKolkata metro trains operate on typical Indian Railways automatic signalling technology. A Route Relay Interlocking System has been provided at New Garia depot and Tollygunge depot and Electronic Interlocking has been provided at Noapara depot, to facilitate the prompt withdrawal and injection of rakes as well as performing shunting operations inside the car shed, required for maintenance purposes. Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) is provided on the entire stretch of the Metro Railway. This system is designed to prevent collision caused by human (operator) error. Train Describer System and Auto Train Charting is used to help the operation control centre to monitor and plan train movement on a real-time basis. Integrated Power Supply System and Microprocessor based Data Logger System have also been provided. An integrated system of STM-1 & STM-4 optical fibre cable, is used for all telecommunication, signalling, SCADA and other circuit in Line 1. The service is provided by RailTel.\n\nUp-gradation of existing signalling system of North-South corridor, from Indian Railways Signalling to Communication Based Train Control was planned by Metro Railway, Kolkata at Rs. 467 crores and the proposal was sent to Indian Railways recently, so that time interval between trains can be decreased to just 90 seconds from 5 minutes. Railways gave a go-ahead to the proposal, and installation work is supposed to be complete within 2–3 years.\n\nUnlike the previous line, the East-West line adopted the more advanced Communications Based Train Control system. It has cab signalling along with centralised automatic train control system consisting of automatic operation, protection and signalling modules. The signalling system is provided by Italy based company Ansaldo STS. The other signalling equipment includes an integrated system featuring fibre optic cable, SCADA, radios and a PA system.\n\nThe Station PA system is present at all the stations and its premises. Station Master can make necessary announcement to the passengers and staff, overriding the ongoing local announcement. The Train PA system is controlled by the motormen, for any kind of announcements to passengers on the particular train.\n\nFew movies were also shot in Kolkata Metro. List of movies shot:\n\n\nSince Kolkata Metro was constructed in the 1970s, there were some technical limitations. Due to the tunnel dimensions, and being under Indian Railways, Kolkata Metro opted Indian metre gauge shell (22.7 m) with broad gauge tracks. Thus, limiting the option of rake manufacturers for Kolkata Metro Line 1. From its inception, the coaches are manufactured by ICF. And ICF with no pre-requisite knowledge manufactured non-air-conditioning rakes. The 3000 and 4000 series rakes were faulty and delivered without any trials, Also, Indian Railways signalling is used instead of European signalling. All these lead to snags, delays, and accidents.\n\nUnlike Delhi Metro, Kolkata Metro is owned and operated by Indian Railways, instead of an autonomous body. It has to rely on Indian Railways for every decision; financial, infrastructural etc. The founder of Delhi Metro, E. Sreedharan said Indian Railways are not experts at urban transport and misplanned the Kolkata metro from the beginning. A private company should run the metro and can bring it up to standard in five years.\n\n\n"}

It is the follow up to 2004's \"X-Men Legends\". It was released in September 2005 for the GameCube, Microsoft Windows, N-Gage, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Xbox. It is set after the events of \"X-Men Legends\" and features the mutant supervillain Apocalypse as the primary antagonist.\n\nThe developers intended the game to have a greater sense of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men to defeat a greater threat. High quality cinematics were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also added.\n\nThe game was well received by gaming critics on all platforms. Critics felt that the inclusion of online play, additional mutant powers, and a larger cast made the game an improvement over its predecessor. Some reviewers were critical of the game's voice acting and felt that the gameplay was repetitive. It sold enough copies to be added to the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.\n\n\"X-Men Legends II\" is an action role-playing game. It unites two Marvel Comics superhero teams, the heroic X-Men and the villainous Brotherhood of Mutants as they together face the mutant supervillain Apocalypse and his minions. Players can choose up to four characters to use at once from a larger roster. Players unlock additional characters as they proceed through the game. Four players can play on one machine cooperatively, and players can join or leave at any time. The game also features online play for up to four players, a first for the series. A new game plus mode is included that allows players to play through the game a second time while retaining all character stats.\n\nAs characters gain experience points their mutant superpowers and unique abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay can also be equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, in which two or more players punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities can also be used in the same manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.\n\n\"X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse\" features a central hub that players return to between missions. It is a designated area free from enemies, and its setting changes to coincide with the current act of the game. Here players can view loading screen art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed here. Players can also participate in an X-Men trivia game which awards experience points for correct answers. Additionally, players can access a virtual combat environment known as the Danger Room to play additional missions unlocked during gameplay.\n\nThe mobile phone version of the game is primarily a beat 'em up with role-playing elements. Unlike the console versions, the game plays as a side-scroller in the same vein as the 1992 \"X-Men\" arcade game. There are five selectable characters, and players upgrade each through experience points earned. Players control one character at a time, and can switch to another at the press of a button.\n\n\"X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse\" is not set in any particular Marvel Comics universe. The game takes place some time after the events of \"X-Men Legends\". The mutant supervillain Apocalypse, having witnessed the X-Men's defeat of Magneto remotely, declares that the Age of Apocalypse is nigh. Prior to the game's campaign he kidnaps Professor X and Polaris for unknown purposes. Locations include a military prison in Greenland, the fictional mutant sanctuary of Genosha, the Savage Land and Egypt.\n\nThe game begins with the X-Men and Brotherhood of Mutants uniting forces to save Professor X and Polaris. Cyclops, Storm, and Wolverine meet up with Magneto, Mystique, and Sabretooth at a military prison outpost in Greenland to free Professor X. Upon freeing him, the teams relocate to the fictional mutant haven of Genosha. They find the island ravaged by Apocalypse's forces, and work through the wreckage and find out what he was searching for. They learn that Quicksilver was kidnapped by Apocalypse, who also kidnaps Beast from the X-Mansion. Beast manages to point the team in the direction of the Savage Land, a secret prehistoric preserve in Antarctica.\n\nThe teams work their way through the Savage Land, temporarily hindering Apocalypse's plans. Apocalypse then travels to conquer New York. The teams work at sabotaging his army and resources, but Emma Frost and Angel are kidnapped as well. Angel is unwillingly transformed by Apocalypse and Mister Sinister into Archangel, a Horsemen of Apocalypse. He is assigned as a sentry to Apocalypse's tower. The teams defeat Archangel and infiltrate the tower where they find Beast, now under the control of Mister Sinister; he kidnaps Sabretooth and escapes with Apocalypse and Mister Sinister to Egypt.\n\nThey learn that Apocalypse's plan is to use Polaris, Quicksilver, Emma Frost, and Sabretooth—four mutants with what he refers to as Harmonic DNA—as part of a machine to fuel an experiment to grant him massive amounts of power. The teams then follow Apocalypse to Egypt where they defeat Mister Sinister, freeing Beast from Sinister's control. After besting the final guard, the Living Monolith, the teams battle Apocalypse and defeat him by stealing the powers from his machine. In the final cutscene, Magneto and Professor X part once again as adversaries, noting that Apocalypse was defeated but not destroyed. Beast ponders why the machine did not work properly, wondering if sabotage was a factor. As the X-Jet flies away, Sinister is seen on top of the pyramid, laughing, hinting that he sabotaged the machine.\n\nSeveral playable characters return from \"X-Men Legends\", and select members of the Brotherhood of Mutants are also playable. Some non-playable X-Men and Brotherhood characters appear during levels. In some instances dialogue throughout the game can be character-to-character specific, depending on the player character's alignment and relationship with the non-player character.\n\n\"X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse\" was announced on October 21, 2004, exactly one month after the release of \"X-Men Legends\". It was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and San Diego Comic-Con in 2005. It was first released in North America on September 20, 2005 for the Gamecube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows platforms. The PlayStation Portable version was released approximately one month later on October 19, 2005. It was released on the first-generation N-Gage handheld platform on October 31, 2005. A mobile phone version was launched on December 19, 2005. A playable demo was released for the Windows version of the game on November 3, 2005.\n\nDeveloper Raven Software sought to expand on the preceding game's scale. As such, characters were given additional powers to choose from. Locations were also made more diverse. \"With the environments we tried to create [something] more exotic and organic\" stated Dan Vondrak, Project Lead on \"X-Men Legends II\". Locations span from the fictional mutant haven of Genosha, to the Marvel Comics jungle known as the Savage Land, to ancient temples in Egypt. Raven Software collaborated directly with Marvel to write the game's story. Man of Action, a group of former Marvel writers who were responsible for the previous game's story, were not involved. The music was composed by Gregor Narholz. Gameplay and story aspects were adjusted to ensure that four players can play continuously, whereas in the previous game certain missions were limited to one player. The CGI cinematics were created by Blur Studio, who would go on to create cinematics for games such as \"\" and \"\".\n\nVicarious Visions's engine powers \"Rise of Apocalypse\" and its predecessor. They also were responsible for the PlayStation Portable version of the game. Karthik Bala, CEO of Vicarious Visions felt strongly that the PSP version should have the same gameplay as the consoles. \"One of our main goals [...] was to really bring the depth and detail of the console game over to portable form on the PSP.\" Four new exclusive characters were added to the PSP version along with nine new side missions. The control system had to be modified to accommodate the PSP's fewer buttons. Online play is available on the PSP, both in ad-hoc and infrastructure modes. Bala stated that it was a priority for his team. SuperVillain Studios was brought on to the project to focus on the online component of the game. Beenox ported \"X-Men Legends II\" to Microsoft Windows.\n\n\"X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse\" received generally favorable reviews. All platforms hold aggregate scores in the 80–85% range at aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Reported scores at Metacritic ranged from 59% to 100% approval. According to the NPD Group, \"Rise of Apocalypse\" sold over 63,000 units on the Xbox during the month of its release. It sold enough copies to be added to the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits. PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab felt that \"Rise of Apocalypse\" \"caters for X-Men fans and if you can gather three others, you're going to have a great time.\" Tom Byron of 1UP.com praised several aspects of the game, and felt that amidst \"\", \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" and \"Fantastic Four\" game releases in 2005 \"X-Men Legends II\" was the best release from Marvel that year.\n\nCommentary on gameplay was generally positive. G4TV's reviewer lauded the destructible environments, but felt that the gameplay lacked variation. The reviewer from VideoGamer.com noted that the co-operative gameplay was strong, and that the addition of online play \"opens the [gameplay] up to a wider range of people.\" PALGN's Jeremy Jastrzab felt that the game's menus were convoluted and difficult to navigate, and also felt that the game began to drag near the end of the story. GameTrailers's reviewer The inclusion of additional mutant powers and online gameplay were points of praise. GameSpot's Greg Mueller praised the game's vast cast of characters, destructible environments and unlockable content, but felt that the user interface was awkward. Mueller also felt that the game loaded content far too frequently. GamesRadar's Raymond Padilla had similar complaints about the frequency and length of the game's load times. Padilla praised the addition of online play and the automatic upgrade system.\n\nReviewers have high marks on the game's cast of characters, but were divided in their opinions of the choice of voice actors. GameTrailers's reviewer disliked that several famous X-Men and Brotherhood characters were not playable, but appeared only as side characters. They also cited issues with voice acting and a convoluted story. Unlike the critic from GameTrailers, G4's reviewer praised the overall story, and further praised the selection of characters for the cast. Greg Mueller of GameSpot also praised the game's vast cast of characters.\n\nCritics were split on their assessment of the game's visuals. The reviewer from GameTrailers noted that the game's visuals had improved greatly, citing the effects, environments and cinematics as some of the largest upgrades. Inversely GamesRadar's Raymond Padilla felt that the game's graphics felt dated. Steve Steinberg of GameSpy conceded that while the visuals were generally improved over the game's predecessor, it still lacked in quality and variation. Steinberg stated that the characters now felt like \"a part of the environments, as opposed to cut-outs floating on top of it.\" He noted that even with the improvements that players may lose their character amidst the environment, causing confusion.\n\nThe success of the \"X-Men Legends\" series led Raven Software, Marvel, and Activision to create the video game \"\", which was released on several consoles, handheld devices and Microsoft Windows in 2007. Barking Lizards, Vicarious Visions and Beenox handled the ports for different platforms. \"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance\" was followed by \"\", jointly developed by Vicarious Visions, n-Space and Savage Entertainment. \"Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2\" was released on several consoles and handhelds in the fall of 2009. Vicarious Visions developed the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, while n-Space developed the Nintendo DS, PSP and Wii versions. Savage Entertainment ported the version developed by n-Space to the PSP.\n"}
{"id": "2067217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067217", "title": "Ernest Newman", "text": "Ernest Newman\n\nErnest Newman (30 November 1868 – 7 July 1959) was an English music critic and musicologist. \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" describes him as \"the most celebrated British music critic in the first half of the 20th century.\" His style of criticism, aiming at intellectual objectivity in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, such as Neville Cardus, was reflected in his books on Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss and others. He was music critic of \"The Sunday Times\" from 1920 until his death nearly forty years later.\n\nNewman was born William Roberts in Everton, a district of Liverpool, the only child of Seth Roberts, a Welsh tailor, and his second wife Harriet, \"née\" Spark, both of whom had children by their first marriages. He was educated at St Saviour's School, Everton, Liverpool College and University College, Liverpool, graduating in 1886, where he studied English literature, philosophy and art. He had no formal musical education but taught himself to play the piano \"after a fashion\", could read music as easily as books, studied vocal music, composition, harmony and counterpoint, and introduced himself to a wide range of music through reading scores. The young Roberts was intended to pursue a career in the Indian Civil Service, but his health broke down, and he was medically advised not to contemplate residence in India. He became a clerk in the Bank of Liverpool from 1889 to 1903. In his spare time he acquired complete or partial competence in nine foreign languages, wrote for a number of journals on music, literature, religion and philosophical subjects, and published his first two books, \"Gluck and the Opera\", in 1895 and \"A Study of Wagner\", in 1899.\n\nNewman had been brought up as an Anglican, but as an adult he rejected the church. He joined the National Secular Society in 1894, through which he met J. M. Robertson, who became a lifelong friend, influencing his approach to criticism. In 1897, Newman wrote \"Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century\", a critique of imprecise and subjective writing. This displayed, in the words of the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", \"the three most prominent characteristics of his critical thought: scepticism, dialectic skill, and passion for accuracy.\" He published the book under the pen name Hugh Mortimer Cecil, but all his other works bore the name Ernest Newman, which he adopted to suggest the fresh approach he intended to take toward his subjects: \"a new man in earnest\". He subsequently used the name in his private life as well as his public life, although he never made the change legal. In 1894 Newman married Kate Eleanor Woollett. His early articles on music were written for the composer Granville Bantock's \"New Quarterly Musical Review\". In 1903 as principal of the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music Bantock invited Newman to join his staff to teach singing and musical theory.\n\nNewman moved from Birmingham in 1905 to become music critic of \"The Manchester Guardian\", where he was a controversial reviewer, sometimes displeasing the local musical establishment. Newman condemned Hallé Orchestra audiences for their complacency, calling them \"ostriches\" and \"vandals\"; castigated conductor Hans Richter for his old-fashioned and unadventurous programming; and criticised the orchestra's poor standard of performance. His trenchancy cost him his job, and he left Manchester the following year, succeeded by Samuel Langford, and moved back to Birmingham as music critic of \"The Birmingham Post\". \"The Guardian\" later said of this period in his career, \"At Birmingham he was at his best, pungent every morning about the latest singer or fiddler, quick to value a new work, while every week he turned his Monday article into an exciting debating-ground.\"\n\nDuring his Birmingham years he wrote studies of Richard Strauss (1908), Edward Elgar (1906), Hugo Wolf (1907) and Richard Wagner (1914). His \"Hugo Wolf\" remained the only English study of the composer for more than forty years and achieved the distinction of being translated and published in Germany. \"The Times\" said of his 1914 Wagner book, \"His enormous admiration for the artist and his contempt for the man were set out in \"Wagner as Man and Artist\", a powerful book exasperating to the devout believers in the cult of Bayreuth.\"\n\nHis first wife died in 1918. In 1919 he married Vera Hands, a former music student at the Midland Institute, and in the same year, finding Birmingham \"unmusical, and in a general way uncultured\", he moved to London as music critic of the Sunday newspaper \"The Observer\". He had previously resisted any move to London, reluctant to undertake the daily schedule of routine concerts that was then expected of music critics on London daily papers, but \"The Observer\" offered him conditions that he found irresistibly congenial.\n\nWithin a year Newman was induced to move to the rival \"Sunday Times\". As the critic of a Sunday paper, Newman \"could pick out the more interesting musical events of the week and discuss them in conjunction and with an air of comparative leisure. His weekly articles soon became a valued feature which all musically minded people had to read.\" He remained at \"The Sunday Times\" from 1920 until his death nearly forty years later, except for a short break when he was guest critic of the \"New York Evening Post\" in 1923. He also wrote weekly articles for \"The Manchester Guardian\" (1919–24) and Glasgow Herald (1924–28) and contributed to \"The Musical Times\" between 1910 and 1955 on subjects as varied as Claude Debussy; Women and Music; Elgar; Johannes Brahms; Beethoven's \"Unsterbliche Geliebte\"; Bayreuth; Franz Liszt; J. S. Bach; Bantock; Hugo Wolf; Arnold Schoenberg; Russian Opera and Russian Nationalism; Medtner; Hector Berlioz; Enrique Granados; and Modest Mussorgsky. From 1930 he made weekly radio broadcasts about music and wrote a sporting column for the \"Evening Standard\".\n\nNewman's largest work was \"The Life of Richard Wagner\", in four volumes, published between 1933 and 1947. In 1959, \"The Times\" judged it \"likely to remain the standard biography of Wagner in the English language,\" and Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians commented in 2009, \"it has still not been surpassed although research has uncovered much that is new.\" While working on this study, he paused to write a book about Wagner's father-in-law, Franz Liszt (1934), but Newman was sharply critical of Liszt's character, and it has been maintained that the bias of the book \"tarnished his critical integrity\". Other books published by Newman during his \"Sunday Times\" years include the popular collections \"Opera Nights\" (1944, an unexpected wartime best-seller), \"Wagner Nights\" (1949) and \"More Opera Nights\" (1954), published in the US under the title \"Seventeen Famous Operas \" (1955).\n\nTroubled by deteriorating eyesight, Newman ceased to write his weekly \"Sunday Times\" article after the autumn of 1958. He died the following year at Tadworth, Surrey, age 90. He was survived by his second wife.\n\nFor most of his life, Newman strongly resisted all official honours, but in his old age he agreed to accept the Order of the White Rose of Finland in 1956 and Germany's Grosse Verdienstkreuz in 1958, as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of Exeter in 1959. In 1955 a tribute described as a Festschrift, \"Fanfare for Ernest Newman\" was published to mark his golden jubilee as a critic, with contributions from Neville Cardus, Philip Hope-Wallace, Gerald Abraham, Winton Dean, Christopher Hassall and Sir Jack Westrup, among others.\n\nIn 1963, Newman's widow published a memoir of him. Reviewing the book, Jack Westrup wrote, \"Her narrative records quite simply her day-to-day life with her husband over a period of forty years... Here is the picture of a relentless worker, frequently struggling with ill health, obstinate in his determination to make enough to live on, groaning under the self-imposed burden of his life of Wagner... The only faintly disturbing note is the fact that he did not like children.\"\n\nGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote of Newman:\n\nIn an obituary tribute, \"The Observer\" said of Newman, \"Unlike most scholars, Newman was unsurpassed as a musical journalist. The vigour of his prose and the sense of a large personality that it breathed, his wit and trenchancy as well as his learning made him beyond question the outstanding critic of his time.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was established by Robert Edmond Grant in 1828 as a teaching collection of zoological specimens and material for dissection. It is one of the oldest natural history collections in the UK, and is the last remaining university natural history museum in London. Notable specimens and objects held by the museum include a rare quagga skeleton, thylacine specimens, dodo bones and Blaschka glass models. \n\nRobert Edmond Grant was the first Chair of Zoology in England, the founder of the Grant Museum collection and its first curator. He set the precedent that the Chair of Zoology at UCL (then the University of London) was also the curator of the comparative zoology collection. On his death Grant left his own collection to the museum, and was briefly succeeded by William Henry Allchin before care of the collection passed to invertebrate zoologist Edwin Ray Lankester in 1875. Lankester was curator until 1891 and added significantly to the museum collection. Later lecturer curators included evolutionary biologist W. F. R. Weldon, Edward Alfred Minchin, embryologist J. P. Hill and palaeontologist D. M. S. Watson. After 1948 the curatorship of the museum was no longer the responsibility of the Chair of Zoology and the museum was under the care of professional curators.\n\nThe Grant Museum has been in continuous use by students at UCL since 1828, and first opened to the public in 1996. In 2011, the museum moved from its previous location in the Darwin Building on the UCL campus to the Thomas Lewis Room in the Rockefeller Building, formerly the UCL Medical School library.\n\nThe Grant Museum contains around 68,000 zoological specimens, many of which are very rare and several of which have been recently rediscovered. The collection contains specimens from a number of former university collections, including specimens from Imperial College London and Queen Mary University of London in addition to material from London Zoo and various London hospital comparative anatomy collections.The museum also contains specimens from the collections of Thomas Henry Huxley, Karl Pearson, Victor Negus and Doris Mackinnon, and material from the Discovery Expedition and Challenger Expedition.\n\n 2018 Paper 1 Social Studies O Level Paper: Pokémon Stop\n\n"}
