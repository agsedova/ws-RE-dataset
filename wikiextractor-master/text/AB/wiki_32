Three British motor manufacturers, Alvis, BSA Cycles and Morris, were invited to supply prototypes. Alvis had been in partnership with Nicholas Straussler and provided armoured cars to the Royal Air Force, Morris had participated in trials and production of armoured cars and BSA Cycles – whose parent Birmingham Small Arms (BSA) was involved in armaments – had a small front wheel drive vehicle in production.\n\nTesting began in August 1938. All were of similar size and layout – rear engine and all four-wheel-drive. The Morris design was eliminated first – suffering from poor speed even after modification by its builders. The Alvis prototype – known as \"Dingo\" – could manage over a cross country course but had a high centre of gravity.\n\nThe BSA prototype was completed in September and handed over for testing. By December, it had covered on- and off-road with few mechanical problems. Policy from the War Office changed to a requirement for an armoured roof. The BSA vehicle needed a more powerful engine and strengthened suspension. It was chosen over the Alvis and the first order (172 vehicles) for the \"Car, Scout, Mark I\" was placed in May 1939. The actual production was passed to Daimler, which was a vehicle manufacturer in the BSA group of companies.\n\nThe potential of the design was recognised, and it served as the basis for the development of a larger armoured car – a \"Light Tank (Wheeled)\", which would later become the Daimler Armoured Car. The first pilot vehicle was built by the end of 1939, later to be named 'Daimler Scout Car' but already known by the name of the Alvis design - the 'Dingo'.\n\nArguably one of the finest armoured fighting vehicles built in Britain during the war, the Dingo was a compact two-man armoured car, well protected for its size with of armour at the front and powered by a 2.5 litre 55 hp straight six petrol engine in the rear of the vehicle. An ingenious features of the Dingo's design was the transmission, which included a preselector gearbox and fluid flywheel that gave five speeds in both directions, another was a four-wheel steering system made possible by the H-drive drivetrain, giving a tight turning circle of . Inexperienced drivers found it difficult to control so rear-steering was deleted in later production at the cost of increasing the turning circle by 65 per cent to .\n\nThe layout of the H-drive drivetrain contributed greatly to its low silhouette, agility and - an important consideration in any vehicle used for reconnaissance, an exceptionally quiet engine and running gear. Power was led forward to a centrally placed transfer box and single differential driving separate left and right hand shafts, each in turn running forwards and back to a bevel box powering each wheel. This compact layout resulted in a low-slung vehicle with a flat plate that allowed the Dingo to slide across uneven ground but made the Dingo extremely vulnerable to mines.\n\nNo spare wheel was carried, considered unnecessary because of the use of run-flat (nearly solid) rubber tyres rather than pneumatic types vulnerable to punctures. Despite hard tyres, independent coil suspension gave each wheel approximately vertical deflection and coil springs all round gave a remarkably comfortable ride.\n\nA swivelling seat beside the driver allowed the second crew member to attend to the No. 19 wireless set or Bren gun. The driver's seat was canted slightly off to the left of the vehicle which, in conjunction with a raise-able vision flap in the rear armour, allowed the driver to drive in reverse and look behind by looking over his left shoulder, a useful feature in a reconnaissance vehicle where quick retreats were sometimes necessary.\n\nThe Dingo remained in production throughout the war but to bring other production resources into use, the design was passed to Ford Canada, where an equivalent vehicle (\"Scout Car, Ford, Mk.I\", also called \"Lynx\") was built with a more powerful Ford V8 95 hp engine, transmission and running gear. The vehicle superficially resembled the Dingo in general arrangement and body shape, was approximately a foot longer, wider and taller, a ton and a half heavier, less nimble (the turning circle was ) and was louder. While rugged and dependable, it was not as popular as the Dingo, unsurprising given the intended use of covert intelligence-gathering. Total production figures for each type were 6,626 for the Dingo (all marks) 1939–1945 and 3,255 for the Lynx 1942–1945.\n\nThe Dingo was first used by the British Expeditionary Force (1st Armoured Division and 4th Royal Northumberland Fusiliers) during the Battle of France. It turned out to be so successful that no replacement was sought until 1952 with the production of the Daimler Ferret. Principal users were reconnaissance units with a typical late-war recce troop consisting of two Daimler Armoured Cars and two Daimler Dingoes. The vehicle was highly sought-after with damaged Dingoes often being recovered from vehicle dumps and reconditioned for use as private runabouts. One such 'off establishment' vehicle was rebuilt from two damaged Dingoes in Normandy, 1944, by REME vehicle fitters of 86th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. They operated this Dingo for about a week before a higher-ranking officer spotted it and commandeered it for himself.\n\nWriting in 1968, author R.E. Smith said that all Dingoes had now been withdrawn from British service - except for one used as a runabout at an armoured establishment - but some might have remained in Territorial Army storage at that date. Many were also purchased from Canada by the Union Defence Force after the Second World War, though few South African examples have survived to the present day, and were also procured in large numbers for Commonwealth patrols during the Malayan Emergency. Ten were purchased by the United States for liaison purposes during the Vietnam War, at least one turreted American prototype being tested with the 7th Cavalry Regiment. In the mid-1970s, the Dingo was still being used by Cyprus, Portugal and Sri Lanka. Some may have been in reserve store with other minor nations. Surviving vehicles are now popular with historical re-enactors with reconditioned Dingoes commanding a good price.\n\nProduction went through 5 variants, which were mostly minor improvements. 6,626 vehicles were produced from 1939 to 1945.\n\nAnother Dingo clone, the \"Autoblindo Lince\" was developed by Lancia, Italy. In 1943-1944, 129 cars were built. They were employed by both German and RSI forces.\n\n\n"}

A course in a medieval feast often began with one or two potages, which would be followed by roasted meats.\n\nEuropean cottage gardens often contained a variety of crops grown together. These were called \"potage gardens\" by the French, as the harvest from that garden was used to make potage.\n\nThe earliest known cookery manuscript in the English language, \"The Forme of Cury\", written by the court chefs of King Richard II in 1390, contains several potage recipes including one made from cabbage, ham, onions and leeks. A slightly later manuscript from the 1430s is called \" Potage Dyvers\" (\"Various Potages\"). The word \"pottage\" is used in the earliest English translations of the Bible, in relation to the lentil soup for which Esau trades his birthright in ; from this story, the phrase \"mess of pottage\" means something attractive but of little value being exchanged for something much more important. During the Tudor period, a good many English peasants' diets consisted almost solely of potage. Some Tudor-era people ate self-cultivated vegetables like cabbages and carrots and a few were able to supplement this from fruit gardens with fruit trees nearby.\n\nSome potages that were typical of medieval cuisine were frumenty, jelly (flesh or fish in aspic), mawmenny (a thickened stew of capon or similar fowl), and pears in syrup. There were also many kinds of potages made of thickened liquids (such as milk and almond milk) with mashed flowers or mashed or strained fruit.\n\n\n"}

He was subject to the Wāli of Al-Andalus, Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi. According to late 9th century Asturian chronicles, he was defeated after the Battle of Covadonga and killed by Pelayo of Asturias at the beginning of the Reconquista.\n\nTradition (late Asturian chronicles) has it that he fell in love with Pelayo's sister, Ormesinda, and that, together with Kazim, kidnapped and married her. The chronicle of Alfonso III speaks of a \"compulsory marriage\", the failure of which compelled Pelayo into rebellion. The historical context can only be speculated, but Pelayo may have tried to secure alliances and a preferential status among the local nobles through the marriage of his sister to the new power in the area, as the Asturian kings would later do with Basques in Pamplona and all of the Christian families did with the Caliphate in Córdoba. It may also have served as a counterweight to Peter of Cantabria and represented nominal submission.\n\nAfter the loss of a Muslim garrison out on a punitive expedition, Munuza may have taken undisputed control of the Asturian coastal region, but kept court in the western districts closer to dominated and occupied Galicia. Having been defeated in his bid to secure the region of León, he may have fled from Gijón, but Christian chronicles reported he was killed with all his soldiers in Trubia or La Felguera.\n\nOther contemporary chronicles speak of \"Munuza\", a distorted name standing for Uthman ibn Naissa, a Berber commander in charge of operations in the Umayyad-occupied eastern Pyrenees, Cerdanya, a decade later. He may not have died in Asturias, and may have been assigned to the new location by the Umayyad commanders.\n\nOdo the Great had a rival in Charles Martel of the Franks, who, for whatever reason, had not come to his assistance at the Battle of Toulouse in 721. Charles wanted Aquitaine, and Odo, as master of Aquitaine and hero of Toulouse, was a possible rallying point for anyone opposing the Austrasian usurper mayors among the Franks. \n\nIn 730, Munuza, the Berber deputy governor of Catalunya, hearing of the oppression of Berbers in North Africa, negotiated a peace treaty with Odo, sealed by the marriage of Odo's daughter, Lampagia, to Munuza. Arab raids on Aquitanian possessions immediately ceased and peace was temporarily restored. \n\nIn 731, Charles Martel, after defeating the Saxons, turned his attention to the rival southern realm of Aquitaine, denounced Odo's alliance with Uthman ibn Naissa, and crossed the Loire, thus breaking his peace treaty with Odo. The Frankish leader ransacked Aquitaine twice, seizing Bourges too, and Odo engaged the Frankish troops but was defeated. Charles went back to Francia.\n\nMeanwhile, Munuza had revolted against the Arab governor-general of al-Andalus, with the aim of setting up an independent Catalunya for himself. Munuza went on to kill Nambaudus, the bishop of Urgell, an official of the Hispanic Church based in Toledo. Munuza was declared a traitor and attacked. Odo was dealing with Martel and unable to come to his aid. Munuza was defeated in a brief battle and executed by the Cordovan Wali Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi.\n\nOdo was accused by the governor-general of abetting the traitor. Odo was attacked by an Arab army and beaten at Bordeaux, the city the Arabs called al-Burdil.\n\n"}

It was modified and used by subsequent monarchs until 1838. The empty gold frame and its aquamarine monde which dates from the reign of King James II are both part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. They are on public display in the Martin Tower at the Tower of London.\n\nThe crown, made by royal jeweller Samuel Smithin, replaced the state crown of Charles II (also used by his successors, James II, William III and Queen Anne) and incorporated some of the jewels and pearls from the old crown, with the addition of 265 new pearls, 160 diamonds, 6 emeralds and 2 sapphires, at a total cost of £1,440. Very little change was made to either the shape of the crown or the arrangement of the stones. The gold frame is tall, and the monde and cross surmounting it are tall.\n\nThe crown is vibrantly depicted in a watercolour painting by Bernard Lens III, the miniature painter to the court of George II, dated 1731. This date suggests that Lens had made a sketch of the crown before it was entirely reset in 1727 for George II but did not finish it until some time afterwards. The inscription reads:\n\nThe crown with which George I, King of Great Britain, was crowned on 20 October 1714. The cap is of crimson velvet or purple; welt of ermine; circle and arches of beaten gold. The ornaments are silver and set with diamonds; the larger stones are sapphires and emeralds, and a few small rubies. The balas in the cross in front was given to the crown by James II. The ball on which the upper cross is fixed is an aquamarine but the lower part is gold enamelled green. It is worn when the king goes to parliament, is made new for every coronation, and kept at the Tower of London.\n\nThe \"balas\" mentioned here is the Black Prince's Ruby, a large spinel that was actually in the state crown of Charles II, and is first mentioned in Tudor inventories as being set in a crown used by Henry VIII. The \"aquamarine\" dates from 1685, when it replaced the original monde in the state crown of Charles II, and was later found to be paste or coloured glass.\n\nGeorge I's state crown was subsequently used at the coronations of George II, for whom the arches were pulled upwards, and George III. In 1821, because it was seen as being a \"very poor affair\", the crown underwent extensive changes, including the replacement of the rhombus-shaped monde with a globe of diamonds. Although the crown was present at the coronation of George IV, he was crowned using a new coronation crown made especially for him. William IV is the last monarch to ever use the crown. For her coronation in 1838, Queen Victoria had a new Imperial State Crown made, using precious stones from George I's state crown.\n\nEmptied of its jewels and discarded by the royal family, the 1714 crown was loaned to the Museum of London by the Amherst family from 1933 until 1985. It was purchased by Asprey in 1987 and later acquired by Jefri Bolkiah, Prince of Brunei, who presented it to the United Kingdom. It had been valued at £576,000 in 1995 for the purposes of an application to export the crown to the United States. The application was withdrawn during a review by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art. It is part of the Royal Collection and has been on public display in the Martin Tower at the Tower of London since 1996.\n"}

On March 4, 1976, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor, the United States' highest military award, for his selflessness and courage in the face of lethal danger.\n\nLance Peter Sijan, also known by his Serbian name Lazar Šijan (), was born to Sylvester and Jane Sijan on April 13, 1942, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father, who owned a restaurant, was an ethnic Serb, his parents emigrated from Serbia during World War I; his mother was an Irish-American. Lance was the eldest of three children. Sijan graduated from Bay View High School in 1960. Immediately after his graduation he attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School at the United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge, Maryland. After completion of the program, he gained an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado. He played on the academy's football team for three years, but quit the team in his final year to concentrate on his studies. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Humanities in 1965, he was awarded a second lieutenant's commission and began Undergraduate Pilot Training. After its completion, he was assigned to the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 366th Fighter Wing, stationed at Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam. He flew as a pilot and systems officer in an F-4 Phantom.\n\nOn the night of November 9, 1967, for his 52nd combat mission, Sijan and pilot Lt. Col. John Armstrong were tasked with a bombing mission to Ban Laboy ford in Laos. As they rolled in on their target to release their ordnance, their F-4C (AF Ser. No. 64-0751) was engulfed in a ball of fire due to the bomb fuses malfunctioning and causing a premature detonation on their release. Sijan managed to eject from the aircraft, and although likely rendered unconscious in the ejection, his parachute landed him on a rocky limestone karst ridge adjacent to the target.\nFrom the night of 9/10 November to the morning of 11 November, no electronic or radio signals were heard from either Sijan or Armstrong. However, early on the morning of 11 November, Sijan made radio contact with a Misty FAC F-100F aircraft that was flying over his crash site. For the duration of that day, the USAF launched a massive effort to locate his position, and 'soften up' the numerous enemy air defences in his area. At dusk, the SAR forces were finally able to position a CH-3 Jolly Green Giant helicopter near Sijan's position. During this overall rescue operation, over 20 aircraft were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and many had to return to base. One A-1H aircraft was shot down, though its pilot was soon rescued by a SAR helicopter on station. Sijan, refusing to put other airmen in danger, insisted on trying to crawl to a jungle penetrator lowered by the helicopter, and he opposed the helicopter's Para-Jumper (PJ) coming down to find and rescue him. Sadly, the helicopter crew could not see him in the heavy jungle, and strangely, they did not deploy the PJ to find and rescue Sijan. After the Jolly Green hovered for 33 minutes, and upon hearing no further radio transmissions from Sijan, the on-scene SAR commander (flying in an A-1H Skyraider aircraft) suspected a trap, and thus ordered the Jolly Green and the entire SAR armada to withdraw. Search efforts continued the very next morning, but they were called off when no further radio contact was made with Sijan. He was then listed in a MIA casualty status.\n\nDuring his violent ejection and very rough parachute landing on the karst ridge, Sijan had suffered a fractured skull, a mangled right hand, and a compound fracture of the left leg. He was without food, with very little water, and no survival kit; nevertheless, he evaded enemy forces for 46 days. During this entire period, Sijan was only able to move by sliding on his buttocks and back along the rocky limestone ridge and later along the jungle floor. After managing to move several thousand feet, Sijan crawled onto a truck road along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, where he was finally captured by the North Vietnamese on Christmas Day, 1967. Very emaciated and in poor health, Sijan was imprisoned in an NVA camp. Soon thereafter, he managed to incapacitate a guard and escape into the jungle, but was recaptured several hours later.\n\nSijan was transported to a holding compound in Vinh, North Vietnam, where he was placed in the care of two other recently captured POWs, Air Force Major Robert R. Craner and Air Force Captain Guy Gruters. Although in terrific pain from his severe wounds and brutal beatings and torture from his captors, Sijan had not disclosed any information other than what the Geneva Convention guidelines allowed (name, date of birth, service, rank, and service number). Suffering terribly from exhaustion, malnutrition, and disease, he was soon transported to Hanoi, under the attentive care of both Craner and Gruters. However, in his weakened state, he contracted pneumonia and died in Hỏa Lò Prison (better known as the \"Hanoi Hilton\") on January 22, 1968.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Sijan was promoted posthumously to captain on June 13, 1968. His remains were repatriated on March 13, 1974, and were positively identified on April 22, 1974. He was buried with military honors in Arlington Park Cemetery in Milwaukee. His former cellmate USAF Colonel Craner recommended him for the Medal Of Honor, with supporting testimony provided by his other fellow cellmate, USAF Captain Gruters. Sijan received the Medal Of Honor posthumously in 1976, with his parents (Sylvester and Jane Sijan) receiving it on his behalf on March 4, 1976, from President Gerald R. Ford.\n\nSijan's military decorations and awards include:\n\nThe President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\nSIJAN, LANCE P.\nRank and organization: Captain, U.S. Air Force, 4th Allied POW Wing, Pilot of an F-4C aircraft. Place and Date: North Vietnam, 9 November 1967. Entered service at: Milwaukee, Wis. Born: 13 April 1942, Milwaukee, Wis.\n\nCitation:\nWhile on a flight over North Vietnam, Capt. Sijan ejected from his disabled aircraft and successfully evaded capture for more than 6 weeks. During this time, he was seriously injured and suffered from shock and extreme weight loss due to lack of food. After being captured by North Vietnamese soldiers, Capt. Sijan was taken to a holding point for subsequent transfer to a prisoner of war camp. In his emaciated and crippled condition, he overpowered 1 of his guards and crawled into the jungle, only to be recaptured after several hours. He was then transferred to another prison camp where he was kept in solitary confinement and interrogated at length. During interrogation, he was severely tortured; however, he did not divulge any information to his captors. Capt. Sijan lapsed into delirium and was placed in the care of another prisoner. During his intermittent periods of consciousness until his death, he never complained of his physical condition and, on several occasions, spoke of future escape attempts. Capt. Sijan's extraordinary heroism and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty at the cost of his life are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces./S/GERALD R. FORD\nSijan's heroism and courage brought him numerous honors. The United States Air Force created the Lance P. Sijan Award, recognizing individuals who have demonstrated the highest qualities of leadership in their jobs and in their lives. It has become one of the U.S. Air Force's most prestigious awards.\n\nBecause Sijan was the first graduate of the United States Air Force Academy to receive the Medal of Honor, a cadet dormitory, Sijan Hall, was named after him. The dormitory was dedicated on Memorial Day, 1976.\n\nSijan's high school in Milwaukee set up a scholarship in his honor, presented each year to the student who best exemplifies Lance Sijan's examples of leadership and courage. A nearby park, Sijan Playfield, is dedicated to him, and Milwaukee's Serbian community honors him with a memorial on the grounds of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral.\n\nAn F-4 Phantom jet fighter on display in front of the 440th Air Force Reserve at Milwaukee's Mitchell Airport is painted using the color scheme of the one he flew. \n\nIn June 2006, before the 440th Airlift Wing was relocated to Pope AFB in North Carolina, there were calls to move the F-4 Phantom jet fighter display from Mitchell International Airport to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the Lake Michigan lake front. However, the display was finally moved on February 28, 2017 to another more visible location at Mitchell International Airport. It will be re-dedicated at this location on May 26, 2017.\n\nSijan is a member of the DeMolay International Hall of Fame.\n\nMountain Home AFB in Idaho named Sijan St. in his honor. A major road at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Anchorage, Alaska, is also named for him.\n\n\n\n"}

Their primary home arena was the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena but they sometimes played at the Long Beach Sports Arena when the Sports Arena had other contractual obligations. After the 1973–74 season, the franchise moved to Detroit to become the Michigan Stags and again mid-season to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Blades.\n\nThe franchise was originally meant to be called the Los Angeles Aces, but took the \"Sharks\" name after the proposed San Francisco Sharks franchise (not to be confused with the current NHL San Jose Sharks) was transferred to Quebec and became the Nordiques before the WHA began play. They kept the original colors from the name Aces; red and black being the colors of the suits in a deck of cards.\n\nThe Sharks' first season was moderately successful on and off the ice as they finished 3rd in the Western Division (losing in the first round of the playoffs to the Houston Aeros in six games) and attendance was respectable. Gary Veneruzzo led the team with 43 goals, although nobody else had more than 20. The Sharks made up for lack of offensive depth with solid defense and goaltending as they allowed the 3rd fewest goals in the league. The Sharks were also a physical team and led the WHA in penalty minutes. However, their penalty killing was among the league's best.\n\nThe Sharks could not capitalize on their successful first season and sank to last place in their second year. They had the league's worst record, scored the fewest goals, and allowed the second most goals. This drop off coincided with a resurgence across town by the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, who qualified for the playoffs in the 1973-74 season for the first time in five years. Thus, attendance dropped considerably, and after season's end it was announced that the Sharks would relocate to Detroit and become the Michigan Stags. The 1973-74 Sharks are notable for one thing - they were the first team (NHL or WHA) to go an entire season without playing a single tie game. (Note that WHA rules provided for a 10-minute sudden death overtime; if no team scored after 10 minutes, the game was a tie. This resulted in much fewer tie games than in the NHL but even so, the Sharks were the only team to go an entire season with 0 ties).\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n"}

He served in the 1980s as editor at \"Rolling Stone\", during a tenure that \"Reason\" later called \"legendary\". He has contributed to articles in \"Reason\", \"Esquire\", \"Details\", \"New York\", and \"Time\". He has also made cameos on several films and television series. He is best known for his role at \"MTV News\" since the 1980s and for appearing in other MTV-related television specials. He has hosted the SiriusXM radio show \"True Stories\" since 2016.\n\nLoder was born in Ocean City, New Jersey. He graduated in 1963 from Ocean City High School in Ocean City. He spent two years in college \"and just hated it.\" He was drafted into the United States Army and joined its journalism school.\n\nLoder stated that he \"just fell into\" his field, elaborating that his \"entire journalism background is four weeks... That's it. Nothing else. You can learn journalism in four weeks. It's not an overcomplicated thing. It's very, very simple.\"\n\nLoder lived in Europe for the next several years, doing what he later called \"scandal sheet\" \"yellow journalism.\" He returned home to New Jersey at the end of 1972 and worked with a local newspaper and then an Ocean City-based magazine run by the sister of the city's famous writer Gay Talese. He left in the summer of 1976 to work with a free Long Island rock weekly called \"Good Times\". He received about $200 a week.\n\nAfter meeting a fellow \"music geek,\" David Fricke, \"the two of us began driving into Manhattan virtually every night to wallow in the flourishing punk rock scene at CBGB's, Max's, etc. This was, fortunately, cool with the wives. I mean, we'd still be sitting upright at four in the morning through fist fights, mass nod-outs, and sets by bands with names like Blinding Headache, played to audiences of three people, of which we'd be two-thirds. I don't think I can quite convey how great days those were\".\n\nThey both joined \"Circus\" in 1978 and moved to Manhattan. Loder went on to become one of its official editors. The staff had a fun, relaxed atmosphere and considered the magazine to be second or third tier. Loder later said that \"Whatever was said to be 'happening' in commercial pop music was... on the cover of Circus. Disco? Run with it. Shirtless teen popsters? Put 'em on the cover... a, shall we say, ardent enthusiasm for pix of nubile youths. Metal, of course, was really the mag's meat.\" He also remarked that \"it was a foregone conclusion that writing of any technical ambition, about new acts of any real excitement or interest, would make it in the mag only by the sheerest accident.\" Loder briefly experimented with inhalant-based drugs at \"Circus\"; he stopped after experiencing a \"gushing\" nosebleed without any feeling left in his face.\n\nLoder started a nine-year run at \"Rolling Stone\" in May 1979. RockCritics.com has called him \"one of \"Rolling Stone\"'s most talented and prolific feature writers.\" \"Reason\" has called his tenure \"legendary.\" While at \"Rolling Stone\", Loder co-authored singer Tina Turner's 1986 autobiography \"I, Tina\". He then contributed to the screenplay adaptation for the film \"What's Love Got to Do with It\".\n\nLoder joined MTV in 1987 as the host of their flagship music news program, \"The Week in Rock\". It was later expanded and renamed to \"MTV News\" in which he was an anchor and correspondent. Loder was one of the first to break the news of Kurt Cobain's death; he interrupted regular programming to inform viewers that Cobain was found dead. Loder authored a 1990 collection of his \"Rolling Stone\" work called \"Bat Chain Puller\".\n\nLoder has guest-starred as himself on \"Kenan & Kel\", The \"That '90s Show\" episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"Girlfriends\", \"Duckman\", \"Saturday Night Live\", and \"Portlandia\". He has appeared in several films. He was also parodied in the \"South Park\" episode \"Timmy 2000\".\n\nIn 2011, St. Martin's Press published Loder's \"The Good, the Bad and the Godawful: 21st-Century Movie Reviews\", which collected his film reviews from MTV.com and Reason.com.\n\nIn 2016, Loder began hosting the music-based radio talk show \"True Stories\" on SiriusXM.\n\nLoder identifies himself as a libertarian and summarizes his position as \"free love and free markets\". He called former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \"a scary guy\" and called it \"amazing that people don't rise up with pitchforks.\" Loder opposed President George H. W. Bush in the 1992 election and he believes that \"MTV News\" played a small role in Bush's loss. Loder believes that his views came from his childhood experiences, saying:\n\nI grew up on the Jersey Shore, on a little barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or something and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.\n\nIn a 1989 live show, Loder saw Skid Row front man Sebastian Bach wearing a T-shirt reading the anti-gay slogan \"AIDS Kills Fags Dead.\" Loder reacted with an article in which he stated, \"In the land of homophobia, if Axl Rose owns the restaurant and Public Enemy are the diners, we have a new busboy.\" Bach considered Loder's words \"complete bullshit,\" saying that he had only used the shirt to dry himself off and strongly opposes the message on it, and later issued several public apologies.\n\nLoder was highly critical of Michael Moore's documentary \"Sicko\", saying it was \"heavily doctored.\" He argued, \"When governments attempt to regulate the balance between a limited supply of health care and an unlimited demand for it they're inevitably forced to ration treatment.\"\n\nLoder defines news as \"anything that's interesting.\" He is critical of the idea of new journalism and argues that it has been used as a rhetorical shield for lazy journalism. He believes that new technology has fragmented American culture to the extent that no cinematic or musical success can unify it, as with past rock bands such as The Beatles. He also strongly supports copyright laws. He generally considers himself to be supportive of new media despite his role at MTV, once joking, \"MTV is part of Viacom, which controls Paramount, and so on and so forth. It's the evil empire.\"\n\nLoder's philosophy on the people he reports on is that:\nYou shouldn't make friends. It's not a good thing to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to consider you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, and you just have to fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.\n\n"}
{"id": "1954987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954987", "title": "Wilcoxon signed-rank test", "text": "Wilcoxon signed-rank test\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric statistical hypothesis test used to compare two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ (i.e. it is a paired difference test). It can be used as an alternative to the paired Student's t-test (also known as \"\"t\"-test for matched pairs\" or \"\"t\"-test for dependent samples\") when the distribution of the difference between two samples' means cannot be assumed to be normally distributed. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a nonparametric test that can be used to determine whether two dependent samples were selected from populations having the same distribution.\n\nThe test is named for Frank Wilcoxon (1892–1965) who, in a single paper, proposed both it and the rank-sum test for two independent samples (Wilcoxon, 1945). The test was popularized by Sidney Siegel (1956) in his influential textbook on non-parametric statistics. Siegel used the symbol \"T\" for a value related to, but not the same as, formula_1. In consequence, the test is sometimes referred to as the Wilcoxon \"T\" test, and the test statistic is reported as a value of \"T\".\n\n\nLet formula_2 be the sample size, i.e., the number of pairs. Thus, there are a total of \"2N\" data points. For pairs formula_3, let formula_4 and formula_5 denote the measurements.\n\n\nformula_9 is the sign function, formula_31 is the absolute value, and formula_14 is the rank. Notice that pairs 3 and 9 are tied in absolute value. They would be ranked 1 and 2, so each gets the average of those ranks, 1.5.\n\nIn historical sources a different statistic, denoted by Siegel as the \"T\" statistic, was used. The \"T\" statistic is the smaller of the two sums of ranks of given sign; in the example, therefore, \"T\" would equal 3+4+5+6=18. Low values of \"T\" are required for significance. \"T\" is easier to calculate by hand than \"W\" and the test is equivalent to the two-sided test described above; however, the distribution of the statistic under formula_38 has to be adjusted.\nNote: Critical T values (formula_41) by values of formula_11 can be found in appendices of statistics textbooks, for example in Table B-3 of Nonparametric Statistics: A Step-by-Step Approach, 2nd Edition by Dale I. Foreman and Gregory W. Corder\n(https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/nonparametric-statistics-a/9781118840429/bapp02.xhtml).\n\nAs demonstrated in the example, when the difference between the groups is zero, the observations are discarded. This is of particular concern if the samples are taken from a discrete distribution. In these scenarios the modification to the Wilcoxon test by Pratt 1959, provides an alternative which incorporates the zero differences. This modification is more robust for data on an ordinal scale.\n\nTo compute an effect size for the signed-rank test, one can use the rank-biserial correlation.\n\nIf the test statistic W is reported, the rank correlation r is equal to the test statistic W divided by the total rank sum S, or r = W/S.\nUsing the above example, the test statistic is W = 9. The sample size of 9 has a total rank sum of S = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) = 45. Hence, the rank correlation is 9/45, so r = 0.20.\n\nIf the test statistic T is reported, an equivalent way to compute the rank correlation is with the difference in proportion between the two rank sums, which is the Kerby (2014) simple difference formula. To continue with the current example, the sample size is 9, so the total rank sum is 45. T is the smaller of the two rank sums, so T is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18. From this information alone, the remaining rank sum can be computed, because it is the total sum S minus T, or in this case 45 - 18 = 27. Next, the two rank-sum proportions are 27/45 = 60% and 18/45 = 40%. Finally, the rank correlation is the difference between the two proportions (.60 minus .40), hence r = .20.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1954988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954988", "title": "Michigan Stags", "text": "Michigan Stags\n\nThe Michigan Stags were a professional ice hockey team based in Detroit, Michigan that played a portion of the 1974–75 season in the World Hockey Association. On January 18, 1975, the team folded, but the league immediately took over operation and moved the franchise to Baltimore, Maryland where it was known as the Baltimore Blades. The Stags originated as the Los Angeles Aces, but were renamed the Los Angeles Sharks before their first game, one of the WHA's original twelve teams. The Stags played at Cobo Arena, and the Blades at the Baltimore Civic Center.\n\nHaving made their fortunes in industrial chemicals, Detroiters Charles Nolton and Peter Shagena bought the Los Angeles Sharks from Dennis Murphy and relocated the club to Detroit as the Michigan Stags. Coached by former Red Wing player and coach Johnny Wilson, the Stags began play in the 1974–75 season. The owners believed the Stags could be an alternative to the NHL's Detroit Red Wings, who had not been a factor in the league for most of the decade. \n\nUnfortunately, the Stags were even more of a disaster than the Red Wings. The team was composed of journeymen at best, with the exceptions of star left winger Marc Tardif, veteran Western Hockey League star Gary Veneruzzo and beleaguered ex-NHL goaltender Gerry Desjardins (who found his way back to the NHL in mid-season and helped lead the Buffalo Sabres to the Stanley Cup finals). The only notable Stags draft pick to actually sign with Michigan was Ed Johnstone, a future 30-goal scorer with the New York Rangers (he would score four times in 23 games for the Stags). The club also had problems drawing crowds; despite playing over .500 (12-8-2) at Cobo Arena, attendance was not nearly enough to break even. Only 2,522 were at their first home game (it didn't help that Michigan had to play their first five games on the road, as the circus was in town), and subsequent gates weren't much better; the club would average an anemic 2,959 for its 22 home games. Additionally, the Stags were unable to secure a television deal (except for a one-off broadcast; see below), rendering them practically invisible. Bleeding money, Michigan was eventually forced to trade Tardif to Quebec for Pierre Guite, Michel Rouleau and famed minor league sniper Alain Caron. \n\nThe Stags hoped they could at least draw fans for the highly anticipated return of Gordie Howe to Detroit, but Howe's Houston Aeros weren't scheduled to play at Cobo until February 2. The Aeros did come to town to play two exhibition games: the first, across the river in Windsor on October 8; the other, two days later at Cobo Arena. (Howe and his sons missed the first game, as they were in Czechoslovakia with Team Canada; Gordie scored twice in the second contest, before a crowd of 5,536.) As it turned out, Howe and company would never meet Michigan in regular-season contest in Detroit, as the Stags had folded before then.\n\nThe WHA club were one of three new pro franchises that burst upon the Detroit sports scene in 1974, along with the Detroit Loves of World Team Tennis (who also played at Cobo) and the Detroit Wheels of the newly-minted World Football League (who played in distant Ypsilanti, Michigan). Within a three-month span, though, they were all gone: the hapless (1-13) Wheels folded October 10; the Loves (after drawing just 2,213 fans per match and losing $300,000) shifted to Indianapolis on November 18; and, just into 1975, the Stags would disappear as well. Their 5-4, overtime win over Winnipeg on January 9 in front of 3,125 fans at Cobo would turn out to be their last game in Detroit. Two weeks later on January 23, the WHA finally announced that the club was shifting to Baltimore.\n\nThe Baltimore Blades were created out of the remains of the Stags (retaining coach Johnny Wilson, although he was unenthusiastic about the shift) and were operated by the league; the move caused the American Hockey League's Baltimore Clippers, already in financial trouble, to promptly close up shop. After playing seven straight road games (all losses), the Blades debuted at the Baltimore Civic Center on February 2 (ironically against the Howe-led club from Houston) in front of 9,023 fans. Attendance went flat soon thereafter, however, as the Blades averaged only 3,568 for 17 home dates (which was actually an improvement over Detroit, even though the Blades were an awful 3-13-1 in Baltimore.) At season's end, the league contemplated moving the franchise to Seattle (which would have marked the franchise's fourth home in less than a year), but instead the club was terminated. Players from the Michigan/Baltimore team, along with those of the defunct Chicago Cougars, were put into a dispersal draft to be claimed by other WHA teams.\n\nThe team's final record was 21-53-4, the second-worst in the WHA and far out of a playoff spot. Veneruzzo was the leading scorer for the team with a 33-27-60 mark, nearly twice as much as anyone else save for Jean-Paul LeBlanc. (The infamous enforcer Bill Goldthorpe also signed on for seven games, piling up 26 penalty minutes.) The last active Stags/Blades player in major professional hockey was Ed Johnstone, who last played in the 1986-87 NHL season.\n\nThe Stags' radio station was WWJ 950. Gary Morrel was play-by-play announcer while Norm Plummer handled color commentary. (At least one broadcast had only two sponsors mentioned: Nolwood Chemical, a company owned by the Stags' owners, and the Stags themselves.)\n\nMichigan played just one game on local television: the season opener against the Indianapolis Racers, broadcast live from Indianapolis on WXON Channel 20. Detroit radio icon Vince Doyle called play-by-play and former Red Wing Marty Pavelich was the color commentator. The Stags won the game, 4-2, but few saw it; the Stags were up against game five of the 1974 World Series. Eight other games were scheduled to be televised but money became a problem by mid-November, especially after Michigan lost 11 of their next 12 following their season-opening win.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n"}

{"id": "1954993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954993", "title": "Groom of the Stool", "text": "Groom of the Stool\n\nThe Groom of the Stool (formally styled: \"Groom of the King's Close Stool\") was the most intimate of an English monarch's courtiers, responsible for assisting the king in excretion and ablution.\n\nThe physical intimacy of the role naturally led to his becoming a man in whom much confidence was placed by his royal master and with whom many royal secrets were shared as a matter of course. This secret information—while it would never have been revealed, for it would have led to the discredit of his honour—in turn led to his becoming feared and respected and therefore powerful within the royal court in his own right. The office developed gradually over decades and centuries into one of administration of the royal finances, and under Henry VII, the Groom of the Stool became a powerful official involved in setting national fiscal policy, under the \"chamber system\". \n\nLater, the office was renamed Groom of the Stole. The Tudor historian David Starkey classes this change as classic Victorianism: \"When the Victorians came to look at this office, they spelt it s-t-o-l-e, and imagined all kinds of fictions about elaborate robes draped around the neck of the monarch at the coronation;\" however, the change is in fact seen as early as the 17th century. \n\nThe Groom of the Stool was a male servant in the household of the English monarch who was responsible for assisting the king in his toileting needs. It is a matter of some debate as to whether the duties involved cleaning the king's bottom, but the groom is known to have been responsible for supplying a bowl, water and towels and also for monitoring the king's diet and bowel movements and liaising with the Royal Doctor about the king's health. The appellation \"Groom of the Close Stool\" derived from the item of furniture used as a toilet. It also appears as \"Grom of the Stole\" as the word \"Groom\" comes from the Old Low Franconian word \"Grom\".\n\nBy the Tudor age, the role of Groom of the Stool was fulfilled by a substantial figure, such as Hugh Denys (d. 1511) who was a member of the Gloucestershire gentry, married to an aristocratic wife, and who died possessing at least four manors. The function was transformed into that of a virtual minister of the royal treasury, being then an essential figure in the king's management of fiscal policy.\n\nIn the early years of Henry VIII's reign, the title was awarded to court companions of the king who spent time with him in the privy chamber. These were generally the sons of noblemen or important members of the gentry. In time they came to act as virtual personal secretaries to the king, carrying out a variety of administrative tasks within his private rooms. The position was an especially prized one, as it allowed unobstructed access to the king. David Starkey writes: \"The Groom of the Stool had (to our eyes) the most menial tasks; his standing, though, was the highest ... Clearly then, the royal body service must have been seen as entirely honourable, without a trace of the demeaning or the humiliating.\" Further, \"the mere word of the Gentleman of the Privy Chamber was sufficient evidence in itself of the king's will\", and the Groom of the Stool bore \"the indefinable charisma of the monarchy\".\n\nThe office was exclusively one serving male monarchs, so on the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558, it was replaced by the First Lady of the Bedchamber, first held by Kat Ashley. The office effectively came to an end when it was \"neutralised\" in 1559. \n\nOn the accession of James I, the male office was revived as the senior Gentleman of the Bedchamber, who always was a great nobleman who had considerable power because of its intimate access to the king. During the reign of Charles I, the term \"stool\" appears to have lost its original signification of \"chair\". From 1660 the office of Groom of the Stole (revived with the Restoration of the Monarchy) was invariably coupled with that of First Gentleman (or Lady) of the Bedchamber; as effective Head of the royal Bedchamber, the Groom of the Stole was a powerful individual who had the right to attend the monarch at all times and to regulate access to his or her private quarters. Incongruously, the office of Groom of the Stole continued in use during the reign of Queen Anne, when it was held by a duchess who combined its duties with those of Mistress of the Robes. \n\nUnder the Hanoverians the 'Groom of the Stole' began to be named in \"The London Gazette\". In 1726, John Chamberlayne wrote that while the Lord Chamberlain has oversight of all Officers belonging to the King's Chamber, 'the Precinct of the King's Bed-Chamber […] is wholly under the Groom of the Stole'. Chamberlayne defines the Groom of the Stole as the first of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber; translating his title ('from the Greek') as 'Groom or Servant of the Long-robe or Vestment', he explains that he has 'the Office and Honour to present and put on his Majesty's first Garment or Shirt every morning, and to order the Things of the Bed-Chamber'. By 1740 the Groom of the Stole is described as having 'the care of the king's wardrobe'.\n\nThe office again fell into abeyance with the accession of Queen Victoria, though her husband, Prince Albert, and their son, Edward, Prince of Wales employed similar courtiers; but when Edward, prince of Wales, acceded to the throne as King Edward VII in 1901, he discontinued the office.\n\n\n\nHeneage and Denny, as servants \"whom he used secretly about him\", were privy to Henry VIII's most intimate confidences about Anne of Cleves. He told them he doubted her virginity, on account of \"her brests so slacke\".\n\n\n\"Neither Mary I nor Elizabeth I appointed a Groom of the Stool\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Victoria did not appoint a Groom of the Stole; appointments were made, however, in the households of her husband and eldest son\".\n\n\n\n"}

Chumashan, Yukian, and southern Baja languages are spoken in areas with long-established populations of a distinct physical type. The population in the core Chumashan area has been stable for the past 10,000 years . However, the attested range of Chumashan is recent (within a couple thousand years). There is internal evidence that Obispeño replaced a Hokan language and that Island Chumash mixed with a language very different from Chumashan; the islands were not in contact with the mainland until the introduction of plank canoes in the first millennium AD.\n\nAll of the Chumashan languages are now extinct, although they are well documented in the unpublished fieldnotes of linguist John Peabody Harrington. Especially well documented are Barbareño, Ineseño, and Ventureño. The last native speaker of a Chumashan language was Barbareño speaker Mary Yee, who died in 1965.\n\nSix Chumashan languages are attested, all now extinct. However, most of them are in the process of revitalization, with language programs and classes. Contemporary Chumash people now prefer to refer to their languages by native names rather than the older names based on the local missions.\n\nI. Northern Chumash\nII. Southern Chumash\n\nObispeño was the most divergent Chumashan language. The Central Chumash languages include Purisimeño, Ineseño, Barbareño and Ventureño. There was a dialect continuum across this area, but the form of the language spoken in the vicinity of each mission was distinct enough to qualify as a different language.\n\nThere is very little documentation of Purisimeño. Ineseño, Barbareño and Ventureño each had several dialects, although documentation usually focused on just one. Island Chumash had different dialects on Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island, but all speakers were relocated to the mainland in the early 19th century. John Peabody Harrington conducted fieldwork on all the above Chumashan languages, but obtained the least data on Island Chumash, Purisimeño, and Obispeño. There is no linguistic data on Cuyama, though ethnographic data suggests that it was likely Chumash (Interior Chumash).\n\nThe languages are named after the local Franciscan Spanish missions in California where Chumashan speakers were relocated and aggregated between the 1770s and 1830s:\n\nRoland Dixon and Alfred L. Kroeber suggested that the Chumashan languages might be related to the neighboring Salinan in a \"Iskoman\" grouping. Edward Sapir accepted this speculation and included Iskoman in his classification of Hokan. More recently it has been noted that Salinan and Chumashan shared only one word, which the Chumashan languages probably borrowed from Salinan (the word meant 'white clam shell' and was used as currency). As a result, the inclusion of Chumashan into Hokan is now disfavored by most specialists, and the consensus is that Chumashan has no identified linguistic relatives.\n\nThe Chumashan languages are well known for their consonant harmony (regressive sibilant harmony). Mithun presents a scholarly synopsis of Chumashan linguistic structures.\n\nThe Central Chumash languages all have a symmetrical six-vowel system. The distinctive high central vowel is written various ways, including \"barred I,\" \"schwa\" and \"I umlaut.\" Contemporary users of the languages favor or .\n\nStriking features of this system include\n\n\nThe Central Chumash languages have a complex inventory of consonants. All of the consonants except /h/ can be glottalized; all of the consonants except /h/, /x/ and the liquids can be aspirated.\n\nProto-Chumash reconstructions by Klar (1977):\n\n\n"}

Intended to be the WHA's flagship franchise, its short lifespan was a result of being unable to compete with the National Hockey League's established New York Rangers, and the expansion New York Islanders. During its inaugural season, the league had to take ownership of the team. A third owner took over and renamed the franchise the New York Golden Blades to start its second season. The team remained in financial distress and was moved to the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan area township of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, on November 21, 1973, becoming the Jersey Knightsits third name and second home, under three different ownership arrangements, in less than two full seasons of operation.\n\nThe New York Raiders participated in the first WHA draft. Its coach was Camille Henry and the very first draft pick – second overall – was Al Sims. Sims did not, however, play for the Raiders, as he signed with the Boston Bruins instead.\n\nThe team was initially slated to play in the brand-new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Long Island. Nassau County retained William Shea to get an NHL team to play in the new building. The NHL responded by hastily awarding a franchise to Long Island—the New York Islanders. The Islanders' lease with the Coliseum was designed to effectively lock out non-NHL teams.\n\nThe Raiders elected to play in Madison Square Garden, where they faced being tenants to their major competitor, the New York Rangers. The situation rapidly became untenable, with an onerous lease and poor attendance. The three original owners defaulted, and the league ended up taking control of the team midway through the season.\n\nFollowing the season, New York real estate mogul Ralph Brent bought the team and renamed it the New York Golden Blades. While they managed to acquire Andre Lacroix from the Philadelphia Blazers, he was essentially all the franchise had going for it. The team replaced their original orange and blue uniforms with purple and gold uniforms of a unique design, and to coincide with the new identity, the team started the season wearing white skates with gold-colored blades.\n\nThe situation improved very little from the previous season; at times, the Golden Blades played before crowds of only 500 people (in an 18,000-seat arena). Sinking in debt, Brent surrendered the team to the league in late November, just twenty games into the season, with a 6-12-2 record. Veteran player Harry Howell, who had been recently picked up by the Golden Blades after being released from the Los Angeles Kings, was elevated to player-coach, and ordered the team's white skates painted black.\n\nOn November 21, 1973, the WHA moved the team to the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan area township of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and renamed it the Jersey Knights. WHA trustee Howard Baldwin was quoted as saying \"Hopefully, we will be back in New York next season with a strong owner to compete in that market,\" but the WHA would never return to New York, getting no closer than the New England Whalers in 1975, when that team moved from Boston to Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nThe arena in Cherry Hill was available because the previous pro hockey tenant, the Jersey Devils, had folded when the Eastern Hockey League went out of business at the end of the previous season. In a sense, this returned the WHA to Philadelphia; the Blazers had moved to Vancouver shortly after Lacroix left for the then-Golden Blades. Having been locked out of Madison Square Garden just prior to their move, the players were unable to take their Blades jerseys with them, so the team reverted to the previous Raiders uniforms, with the original crest replaced with the new Knights logo.\n\nThe newly minted Knights soon discovered their new home, Cherry Hill Arena, had a slope in the ice surface, which forced visiting teams to skate uphill two out of three periods. (One drawback was that pucks would sometimes shoot upwards unexpectedly; one Knight was knocked cold when a would-be pass jumped up and nailed him between the eyes.) Years later Ab McDonald said, \"[The ice] was so high in the middle, the short guys almost couldn’t see the other end of the ice.\"\n\nThe arena was also closely cramped, with players not having adequate changing and dressing facilities; visiting teams had to dress at their hotel. In addition, there was no plexiglass around the playing surface. The boards in the area from face-off circle to face-off circle at each end of the ice was bordered with chicken-wire as protection. The rest of the arena had no protection above the boards.\n\nRod Philips, who did radio games for the Edmonton Oilers for 37 years, ending in 2011, is quoted as saying of the Arena, \"The press box in Cherry Hill, N.J. (across the bridge from Philadelphia) was so small that you couldn't stand up. The roof was only four feet high and you were all hunched over. When somebody shut the door, they cut off one whole end of the rink.\"\n\nDespite the questionable facilities, the Knights played over-.500 hockey and were in playoff contention before losing their last six games to finish 32-42-4, last in the Eastern Division. (They did manage a solid 18-10-1 mark at Cherry Hill, a better record than they ever had in New York.) Within five weeks of the move, though, reports had already begun to state that the franchise would not stay in New Jersey beyond the end of the season, as Cherry Hill Arena was inadequate even for temporary use. Baltimore businessman Joe Schwartz purchased the team in January, fueling speculation the team might move to the Maryland city, or perhaps be re-incarnated as an expansion franchise in Cincinnati or Indianapolis.\n\nInstead, at the end of the 1974 season, Schwartz moved the Knights to San Diego, California, and renamed them the San Diego Mariners.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n"}

They played from 1974 to 1977. Their home ice was San Diego Sports Arena. Previous to being in San Diego, the team was known as the New York Raiders, New York Golden Blades, and Jersey Knights. The San Diego Mariners' name was adopted the following season by an unrelated franchise in the low-level minor professional Pacific Hockey League (PHL).\n\nStar players for the Mariners included defenseman Harry Howell, center Andre Lacroix, and goaltender Ernie Wakely. The Mariners were coached by Howell (as player-coach) during their first season and Ron Ingram the succeeding two seasons, qualifying for the WHA playoffs each year.\n\nDuring the Mariners' final WHA season, the team was owned by San Diego Padres and McDonald's owner Ray Kroc. The team never drew well, and when they only managed to attract 5,000 fans per game, Kroc sold the team to a group who planned to move it to Melbourne, Florida, however, they could not find a suitable arena. The team was then sold to former Philadelphia Flyers minority owner Bill Putnam, who changed the team's name to the \"Florida Breakers\" and announced they would play at the Hollywood Sportatorium in Hollywood, Florida, between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. After this deal fell apart Jerry Saperstein tried to buy the team and move them to the same area as the Florida Icegators. However, this deal collapsed as well, and after three attempts by three different groups to move the team to Florida all failed, the Mariners folded just before training camp opened in the fall of 1977. Fans who put down deposits for season tickets never got their money back. The last Mariners player active in major professional hockey was Kevin Devine, who played his last NHL game in the 1982-83 NHL season. As well, Mariners' draft pick Don Edwards played in the NHL until 1986, but never played in the WHA.\n\nTeam colors for the Mariners were orange and blue. The uniforms were the same design as the team wore as the New York Raiders and Jersey Knights, albeit with the jersey crest replaced with \"San Diego\" spelled out diagonally across the front. The color scheme was the same as it was for the San Diego Gulls of the old Western Hockey League. The color scheme was later adopted in the form of throwback jerseys for the now-defunct WCHL/ECHL San Diego Gulls.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n\nAfter the WHA Mariners folded, San Diego Arena operator Peter Graham joined the idea for a new low-level minor professional hockey league on the West Coast, the Pacific Hockey League (PHL).

{"id": "1955025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955025", "title": "Push (Bros album)", "text": "Push (Bros album)\n\nPush is the debut album by British pop band Bros and was released on 28 March 1988 on CBS. The album peaked at number two in the UK Albums Chart and was certified quadruple platinum in the UK. It was also a worldwide success, reaching number one in New Zealand, and the top ten in Australia and several countries in Europe.\n\nIn late 2013, a 25th Anniversary 3-CD remastered and expanded edition of \"Push\" was released on the Cherry Pop record label, a subsidiary of Cherry Red Records. The song \"Silent Night\", originally released as a double A-side single with \"Cat Among the Pigeons\", was included on the expanded edition, as well as B-sides and remixes from the five singles that were released from the album.\n\nAll the songs were written by Nicky Graham and Bros' manager Tom Watkins, with Graham composing the music and Watkins writing the lyrics. The pair used the pseudonym \"The Brothers\" in order to imply that the songs had been written by the Goss twins, and that the group was not simply a manufactured pop outfit. In his autobiography Watkins described how he had deliberately come up with song titles and lyrics that the teen market could identify with, such as \"Drop the Boy\" being about a youth asking to be treated as an adult. Other themes included childhood poverty (\"Ten Out of Ten\"), the then-current AIDS epidemic (\"Shocked\"), and past relationships (\"I Owe You Nothing\"). One of the album's more serious lyrical subjects was the closing ballad \"Cat Among the Pigeons\", which Watkins stated was about a friend who had struggled to cope with the early death of their father, and as a result had embarked on tempestuous and doomed relationships. Watkins also admitted that his original, more explicit lyric for \"When Will I Be Famous?\", a song that had been created for his own short-lived band the Hudsons, had been written as a conversation between two gay men: a young man desperate for fame and attention, and an older, more experienced man giving his advice. When he and Graham decided to give the song to Bros to record, Watkins toned down the lyrics and removed the references to homosexuality.\n\nGraham composed the music using some basic equipment at his home in Wimbledon in south-west London, before taking the songs to his Hot Nights studio a short distance away in Fulham. There he played all the instruments and programmed all the keyboards, before inviting the group to the studio to learn their parts and record Matt Goss' vocals. \n\nTalking to \"Smash Hits\" in April 1988, Matt Goss explained why the album was titled \"Push\": \"Well, when we were in the studio recording it, if one of us was really, like, going for it we'd say, 'Right man, that's really pushing it.' It's a word we all latched on to, and Nicky latched on to it too. We'd all be going, 'Is that pushing it? Yeah, that's \"push\".' So the album couldn't really be called anything else.\"\n\nReviews of \"Push\" in the UK music press were mixed. In \"Melody Maker\" Jonh Wilde described the album as \"ten songs that are entirely modern in an entirely charmless way\", and called it \"sad and useless\" and \"mediocrity's snowy mountain-top\". However, Tim Nicholson of \"Record Mirror\" stated that \"\"Push\" is perfectly crafted pop oozing pre-sex appeal\".\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Brendan Swift highlighted \"When Will I Be Famous?\" and \"I Owe You Nothing\" as good examples of 1980s pop music, and that while the album contained few low points it also lacked depth, commenting that \"\"Push\" makes for far better dancing than listening\".\n\nIn the UK Albums Chart, \"Push\" was kept off the number one spot by the compilation album \"Now 11\" for two weeks, and then by Tracy Chapman's self-titled album for a week, although \"Push\" went on to sell more copies than both albums in 1988 and ranked as the fourth best-selling album for that year in the UK.\n\nAll tracks written by The Brothers (a pseudonym for Nicky Graham and Tom Watkins).\n\nBros\n\nAdditional personnel\nProduction\n"}
{"id": "1955031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955031", "title": "Littlemore", "text": "Littlemore\n\nLittlemore is a district and civil parish in Oxford, England. The civil parish includes part of Rose Hill. It is about southeast of the city centre of Oxford, between Rose Hill, Blackbird Leys, Cowley, and Sandford-on-Thames. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 5,646, with the electoral ward (which also includes several streets in southern Cowley) having a total population of 6,441.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, and perhaps earlier, most of Littlemore was a detached part of the parish of St Mary the Virgin in Oxford. Between 1517 and 1518 the local priory became subject to the Littlemore Priory scandals. The rest of the township was in the parish of Iffley. Littlemore was not made a separate ecclesiastical parish until 1847. It became a civil parish in 1866.\n\nUntil the early 20th century Littlemore was rural. Extensive development started in the 1920s and continued in the 1950s.\n\nEarly in the 12th century Sir Robert de Sandford founded a priory of Benedictine nuns on a piece of land called Cherley. It was dedicated originally to Saints Mary, Nicholas and Edmund, but within a few years this was reduced to only St Nicholas. The location of Cherley was described variously as Sandford or Littlemore until the middle of the 13th century, after which it was referred to always as Littlemore.\n\nSir Robert endowed the priory with six virgates of land in Sandford parish. Subsequent members of the de Sandford family made further endowments: another nine virgates of land in Sandford, 10 shillings a year from Wytham, tithes from Bayworth and Lambourn, and land at Garsington, Kennington, Sydenham, Oxfordshire and Liverton in the parish of Chilton. At one time the priory also claimed the advowson of St Mary's parish church at Puttenham, Hertfordshire and held land at \"Bureweya\" or \"Bergheia\" in the parish of Soham in Cambridgeshire. King Henry III paid 40 shillings a year to maintain a \"prebendaria\" at the priory and in 1232 granted the priory one hide of land at Hendred.\n\nIn 1445 Dr John Derby visited the priory on behalf of William Alnwick, Bishop of Lincoln. Seven nuns were living there but their dormitory was in such disrepair that they did not sleep in it, for fear it would collapse. The nuns were breaking their Rule by eating meat every day, three lay women were boarding at the priory, and a Cistercian monk frequently visited and drank with the prioress.\n\nIn 1517 Edmund Horde visited the priory on behalf of a subsequent Bishop of Lincoln, William Atwater. He found that the prioress, Katherine Wells, had an illegitimate daughter, the father was a priest who still visited her, and Wells had taken much of the priory's goods and pawned its valuables to provide the girl with a dowry. There was no food, clothing or spending money for the nuns. Within the last year another of the nuns had had an illegitimate child whose father was a married man in Oxford. Some of the other nuns had rebuked Wells but she had responded by putting them in the stocks.\n\nThere were five nuns, and Wells had ordered them all to tell Mr Horde that all was well. Bishop Atwater summoned and examined Wells, who admitted these irregularities had been going on for eight years. Atwater deposed her but allowed her to remain in post for the time being, provided she did nothing without Mr Horde's approval. Nine months after Mr Horde's report, Bishop Atwater visited the priory himself. He found that Wells had taken revenge on those nuns who had told the truth, putting one in the stocks for a month and kicking and punching another nun in the head. Another nun continued to misbehave, romping (\"luctando\") with boys in the cloister and refusing to stop. When she was put in the stocks as a punishment, three other nuns released her and burnt the stocks. When Wells tried to rebuke them, the four escaped from the priory \"via\" a window and went to stay with friends for two or three weeks.\n\nIn 1524 Thomas Wolsey, the Lord Chancellor, recommended that the priory be dissolved. In February 1525 the priory was dissolved and the prioress was pensioned off.\n\nIn 1970 the historian William Pantin published a conjectural plan of the priory church, refectory and other buildings arranged around a cloister west of the surviving building. In 2012 The East Oxford Archaeology & History Project excavated part of Minchery Farm Paddock. It found walls of a well-built Medieval stone building at right-angles to the farmhouse. Finds of fine pottery, metalwork, decorated tiles and animal bones suggest it was a domestic building. The building is roughly where Pantin postulated that the refectory may have been.\n\nIn 2014 John Moore Heritage Services found and excavated the site of the priory church. It was built in the 13th century, with a choir, central tower, nave, belfry and north transept. A smaller mid-12th-century church may have been on the site before the 13th-century one was built, but the evidence for this was not conclusive.\n\n92 human burials were found on the site. Most were inside the church: in the choir, north transept and nave. The remainder were outside just east of the choir. 35 of the burials were female and 28 were male. The sex of the remaining 29 was not determined. One burial was in a limestone cist, positioned under what would have been the centre of the tower, and contained the remains of a woman aged 45 or older. She is likely to have been a prioress. Another burial near the west end of the nave was a woman aged between 19 and 25, laid face down. Part of the grave had been disturbed, her legs were missing, and the body of an infant was buried where they had been.\n\nOne building of the priory survives. It has been identified as the east range of the cloister garth, with the chapter house and other rooms on the ground floor and the nuns' dormitory on the first floor. In about 1600 it was remodelled as Minchery Farmhouse. Later it was extended, probably late in the 18th century. As Littlemore became more developed, the house was changed first into a country club and later into the \"Priory and ?\" pub, which closed in 2013. The house is now a Grade II* listed building.\n\nSt Nicholas' priory had a priory church, but until the 19th century Littlemore had no parish church. In 1828 John Henry Newman was appointed vicar of St Mary's and he started agitating for a separate church at Littlemore. The new parish church of Saint Mary and Saint Nicholas was designed by the architect H. J. Underwood, built in 1835 and consecrated in 1836. The chancel and northeast tower were added in 1848, and the vestry in 1918. The church is in a Gothic Revival style and became a model for smaller churches of the time.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church of Blessed Dominic Barberi was built in 1969.\n\nLittlemore Hospital was located on Sandford Road on the south west side of the village. After it closed, some of the rear blocks were acquired by Yamanouchi (now Astellas Pharma) for use as a research facility but then sold on, in 2008, to the SAE Institute for use as a training establishment. Meanwhile the Littlemore Mental Health Centre, which includes the Ashurst Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), has been established on the opposite side of the road.\n\nThe Wycombe Railway opened Littlemore railway station in 1864 as part of its extension from to .\n\nIn 1963 British Railways withdrew passenger services between and Oxford and closed all intermediate stations including Littlemore. The line through Littlemore remains open for freight traffic between the – Oxford main line at Kennington Junction and the BMW Mini factory at .\n\nLittlemore may be best known for the work of Cardinal Newman, whose connection with the village began in 1828, when he was appointed vicar of St Mary the Virgin and soon began holding classes for the residents of Littlemore. He organised a successful petition to have a new church built. From 1842 to 1846 Newman lived at Littlemore, in a house in College Lane, under a rule of strict monastic discipline. There he took up orders with the Roman Catholic Church (a sensation at the time), and was accepted into the faith by Father Dominic Barberi, a prominent Passionist active in England at the time. Birmingham Oratory bought the property in 1951, and members of an International Religious Order are residents and custodians of the College.\n\nThe trade unionist Henry Broadhurst (1840–1911) was born in the village, the son of a local stonemason.\n\nThe local historian Edmund Arnold Greening Lamborn lived at 34 Oxford Road, Littlemore from 1911 to 1950.\n\n\n\n"}

However, Michel couldn't get a favourable lease for the Gardens. Afterward, it was expected that Hamilton would be the team's home, but they were eventually placed in Ottawa. Nick Trbovich became majority owner before the season began, with Michel running hockey operations.\n\nThey were coached by Billy Harris and led on the ice by Wayne Carleton, who scored 42 goals and 92 points during the season. They hosted the first game in the WHA, held on October 11, 1972, when they played as the home team at the Civic Centre versus the Edmonton Oilers, known as the Alberta Oilers, who defeated the Nationals 7-4.\n\nTheir arena was the Ottawa Civic Centre, but they were a flop at the box office, averaging about 3,000 fans per game. Before the season ended, the City of Ottawa demanded a payment of $100,000 to secure dates for the following season. Rather than agree to this demand, the Nationals opted to move elsewhere for the next season and play its playoff dates in Toronto. During this playoff series, the team was referred to as the Ontario Nationals. After the end of the season, the team was sold to John F.

He argued that this was as important as buying new engines or hiring new firemen. \nAfter a big fire, many of the working class would have to live in tents, he warned.\n\nWentworth was accused of serving only the interest of the insurance industry, and the amendment did not pass. Wentworth later became secretary of the National Board of Fire Underwriters.\n\nAnother failed attempt to increase safety in Salem was undertaken by Charles J. Collins. He had visited Philadelphia where high-pressure wagons pumped water through pipes for a range of . \nThe argument went that high-pressure pumps would pay for themselves with the reduction of insurance fees. Protecting the entire business and mercantile district would have cost US$150,000.\n\nIn 1914, Salem was a city of 48,000 people (12,000 more than ten years earlier), and consisted of 5,826 buildings on at an assessed valuation of US$37.25 million.\nThe streets were wide. Building codes were dated, not mentioning standpipes, fire escapes, or sprinklers.\n\nSalem had 180 fire alarm stations or boxes that could be used to contact telephone operators.\nA long drought preceded the events of June 25, 1914.\n\nThe Great Salem Fire started with a series of explosions, caused by a mixture of acetone, amalacitate, alcohol, and celluloid. \nAt 1:37 p.m. (EDT) on June 25, 1914, a fire alarm box was used to report a fire in the Korn Leather Factory at 57 Boston Street. A memorial plaque is on the site, now occupied by a Walgreens store.\n\nThe fire spread quickly down and across Boston Street, due to a drought. The police department sent out calls to 21 cities for assistance. One industrial department, the Fore River Shipyard, also assisted. Over 90 out of town policemen came to help. The \"Salem Evening News\", (Friday, July 24, 1914, page 11), had a complete list of all responding departments and where and how they worked to fight the fire.\n\nThe \"Salem Evening News\" covered the events in a series of articles, which were later reprinted as a book by Montanye Perry.\n\nThe fire burned of land with 1,376 buildings. The entire loss was estimated at US$15 million; insurance policies paid US$11.744 million. Some 20,000 people lost their homes, 10,000 their jobs, and a few their lives.\n\nChestnut Street, designed by architect Samuel McIntire, survived the fire, as well as what is now City Hall, the oldest continually run city hall in America, open since 1837. The McIntire Historic District is the largest area of homes in America, dating from 1642 to 1865.\n\nAccording to a local legend, the spirit of Giles Corey, who was tortured to death during the Salem Witch Trials in 1692, appears in Salem and walks his death place at the Howard Street Cemetery each time a disaster is about to strike the city. Notably, he was said to have appeared the night before the fire occurred.\n\nSome believe that Corey made the fire occur, as part of his curse against Salem. It could have been revenge over the execution of his wife, Martha. She was one of 19 executed by hanging on Proctor's Ledge, located directly behind where the fire started.\n\n"}

The name derives from the Norman-French for \"beautiful view\".\n\nThe vale is an east-north-east trending tract of low ground of somewhat ill-defined area. Its vale-like form can be viewed from either its southern flank (the Belvoir \"ridge\") or from the north-west along the A46 (Roman Fosse Way) from which it is much less conspicuous. It is the product of geological processes, being occupied in the main by the sedimentary mudstones and thin limestones of the Liassic (Lias), with a northern fringe comprising the upper parts of the Triassic (Mercia Mudstone and Rhaetic). As described above its south-eastern margin is the most clearly defined, as it is formed by a conspicuous scarp slope, about 330 feet (100 m) higher than the valley floor, upon which Belvoir Castle sits. Its resistance to erosion is due to a capping of relatively thick Jurassic Ironstone. The vale-like form is further constrained by cappings of ancient glacial till that form the higher ground along its western margin.\n\nIn the Pliocene epoch (1.7 million years ago) the Vale of Belvoir was occupied by the 'Proto-Trent' River, which cut a gap through the limestone ridge at Ancaster and then on to the North Sea. At the end of the Wolstonian Stage (c. 130,000 years ago) a mass of stagnant ice left in the Vale of Belvoir caused the river to divert north along the old Lincoln river, through the Lincoln gap.\n\nBelvoir Castle, which occupies a dominant position overlooking the vale, is the ancestral home of the family of the Dukes of Rutland. The castle saw significant damage in both the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War and has consequently been rebuilt a number of times in its history. It is now open to the public, whilst still remaining a family home and provides a popular tourist centre to the area. In recent years the Belvoir name has become more widely known through the national and international sale of various cordials and other produce, a scheme introduced by the present duke's father to raise funds for the continued upkeep of the castle and to provide employment in an otherwise farm-dominated local economy.\n\nTwo other local specialities dominate the world reputation of the vale: Stilton cheese and pork pies. Of the six dairies currently allowed to produce true Stilton cheese under the terms of its protected origin status, only one is not located in the area. The vale is the historic centre for the production of this king of English cheeses and until the end of the 19th century all Stilton cheese was being produced within 20 miles of Melton Mowbray. However, the cheese took its name from the Huntingdonshire village of Stilton, where it was served at the coaching inns on the Great North Road. Melton is also the home of the Melton Mowbray pork pie, produced by traditional methods using uncured pork and hand-formed pastry and served cold. Both Stilton cheese and Melton Mowbray pies are covered by European Protected Designation of Origin orders.\n\n\"Belvoir Angels\" are a type of early 18th century Swithland slate tombstone found in the district. A comprehensive account of the natural history of the Vale was compiled in 1790 by the poet George Crabbe, who was chaplain to the Duke of Rutland and rector of Muston, Leicestershire. It includes a list of more than 70 beetle species. The vale is renowned fox hunting country and has many historical ties to the sport.\n\nA controversial coalfield development was proposed in the 1970s. It became the subject of a public enquiry in 1979. The requisite planning applications were ultimately quashed by the secretary of state for the environment in 1982.\n\nThe most populous places in the Vale of Belvoir include Bingham, Cotgrave, Keyworth and Bottesford.\n\nThe Vale of Belvoir has its own award-winning radio station: 103 The Eye which was the first community radio station in the UK to go on air and has been broadcasting since 2005. Based in Melton Mowbray, it broadcasts on 103 FM and via its website.\n\n"}
{"id": "1955045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955045", "title": "Toronto Toros", "text": "Toronto Toros\n\nThe Toronto Toros were an ice hockey team based in Toronto, Ontario that played in the World Hockey Association from 1973 to 1976.\n\nThe franchise was awarded to Doug Michel in 1971 for $25,000 to play in the WHA's inaugural 1972–73 season. Harold Ballard, owner of Maple Leaf Gardens and the Toronto Maple Leafs, offered to rent the arena to the team if it was located in Toronto, but Michel found the rent excessive. He then tried to base the team in Hamilton, but the city did not have an appropriate venue. Michel settled on Ottawa and the team became the Ottawa Nationals. Nick Trbovich became majority owner in May 1972.\n\nThe team was a flop at the box office, averaging about 3,000 fans a game, and in March 1973 — just before the end of the season — the City of Ottawa demanded payment of $100,000 to guarantee the club dates at the Ottawa Civic Centre. The team decided to leave Ottawa and played their home playoff games at Maple Leaf Gardens, attracting crowds of 5,000 and 4,000 in two games before being eliminated by the New England Whalers. During this playoff series, the team was referred to as the \"Ontario Nationals\". At the end of the season, the team moved to Toronto permanently, and was sold to John F. Bassett, son of media mogul and former Leafs part-owner John Bassett. Future Leafs owner Steve Stavro was a minority shareholder. They were renamed the Toronto Toros in June 1973.\n\nInitially, Bassett wanted to move the team into a renovated CNE Coliseum, while Bill Ballard — Harold's son, who was running the Gardens while his father served a prison sentence — wanted the team at the Gardens and opposed the plan to upgrade the Coliseum. The Toros ended up at Varsity Arena for the 1973–74 season. Bassett signed forwards Pat Hickey and Wayne Dillon to aid the offensive attack. He also made a strong attempt to sign Leaf centre Darryl Sittler, and thought he had an agreement for a five-year $1 million contract, but Sittler re-signed with the Leafs. The Toros played to a 41-33-4 record in the regular season, bolstered by goaltenders Gilles Gratton and Les Binkley and a strong defensive corps backstopped by ex-Maple Leaf star Carl Brewer. The Toros also fared well in the playoffs, making it to the Eastern Conference final, only to lose to the Chicago Cougars.\n\nThe Toros moved to the Gardens for the 1974–75 season. However, by this time Harold Ballard had regained control of the Gardens. Ballard was a virulent opponent of the WHA; he never forgave the upstart league for nearly decimating the Leafs' roster in the early 1970s, and Ballard had a few years earlier been involved with a power struggle with Bassett's father for control of the Maple Leafs, one that Ballard ultimately won. Ballard deliberately made the Toros' lease terms at the Gardens as onerous as possible. The Toros' lease with Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. called for them to pay $15,000 per game. However, much to Bassett's outrage, the arena was dim for the first game. It was then that Ballard demanded $3,500 for use of the lights. Ballard also denied the Toros access to the Leafs' locker room, forcing them to build their own at a cost of $55,000. He also removed the cushions from the home bench for Toros' games (he told an arena worker, \"Let 'em buy their own cushions!\"). It was obvious that Ballard was angered at the WHA being literally in his backyard, and took his frustration on the renegade league out on the Toros.\n\nDespite the financial difficulties, the Toros managed to strengthen themselves in the off-season. They signed two ex-Leafs: former NHL superstar Frank Mahovlich and the hero from the 1972 Summit Series, Paul Henderson, as well as Czech star Vaclav Nedomansky, who defected to Toronto. Tom Simpson became the first professional hockey player in Toronto to have a 50-goal season, scoring 52 goals (a number he would never come close to matching again). The Toros finished the year with the league's fifth-best record at 43-33-2, but were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round by the San Diego Mariners. The Toros were now averaging 10,000 fans per home game.\n\nIn part due to the expenses associated with playing in the Gardens, the Toros bottomed out in the 1975–76 season. They finished with a horrible 24-52-5 record—the worst in the league—under coach Bobby Baun, despite Nedomansky's 56 goals and the signing of 18-year-old Mark Napier, who scored 93 points in his rookie year. The Toros still averaged over 8,000 fans per game, which was a 20 percent drop from the previous year.\n\nFollowing the season, with the drop in attendance and onerous lease terms at the Gardens, Bassett moved the club to Birmingham, Alabama, where they were renamed the Birmingham Bulls for the 1976–77 season. The last active Toros player in the NHL was Mark Napier, who last played in the NHL in the 1988-89 NHL season. As well, Toros draft pick Kent Nilsson played his last NHL game in 1995, but never played for Toronto in the WHA.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1955053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955053", "title": "Birmingham Bulls (WHA)", "text": "Birmingham Bulls (WHA)\n\nThe Birmingham Bulls were a professional ice hockey team based in Birmingham, Alabama, USA. They played in the World Hockey Association from 1976 to 1979 and the Central Hockey League from 1979 to 1981. The Bulls played their home games at the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Center.\n\nPrior to being in Birmingham, the team was known as the Ottawa Nationals and the Toronto Toros. The Birmingham Bulls' name has been used for other hockey teams such as the Birmingham Bulls of the East Coast Hockey League and the Birmingham Bulls of the Southern Professional Hockey League.\n\nThe Toros had been modestly successful on the ice since moving to Toronto before the start of the 1973–74 season and had drawn fairly well by WHA standards. However, onerous lease terms at Maple Leaf Gardens led owner John Bassett to move to Birmingham.\n\nAfter the initial move to Birmingham, general manager, Gilles Leger coached the team for a few games until Pat Kelly was brought in to coach the bulk of that first 1976–77 season in Birmingham. In the 1977–78 season, former Minnesota Golden Gophers coach Glen Sonmor was hired to lead the team as head coach and general manager. Sonmor organized a very physical and aggressive team that was the most penalized in the league for their rough play. They set a team record for penalty minutes that stood for decades in all of professional ice hockey. They were often called the \"Birmingham Bullies,\" a play off of the nickname \"Broad Street Bullies\" that the Philadelphia Flyers had earned years earlier, whose own record for penalty minutes the Birmingham Bulls had broken. This new approach to being the bullies debuted on a Thanksgiving Day game in Birmingham against the Cincinnati Stingers. That game started with ten players in the penalty box within the first minute of play. The Bulls won 12–2 and was dubbed by the newspaper as \"The Thanksgiving Day Massacre.\" This was the only one of the three WHA Birmingham Bulls teams to qualify for the WHA playoffs. Facing Bobby Hull and the Winnipeg Jets, who went on to win the championship, they were eliminated in the first round. During Sonmor's tenure as general manager, he successfully negotiated the first \"cross-league\" player trade with the NHL in a deal with the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nJohn Brophy, who later went on to coach the Maple Leafs, had joined head coach Glen Sonmor as an assistant for the second year in Birmingham. Brophy became head coach in the 1978–79 season when Sonmor joined the Minnesota North Stars. His team finished last in the league, but was in the middle of a youth movement in transitioning from being overly physical to highly skilled and was known among the fans as the \"Baby Bulls\". Wayne Gretzky was heavily recruited by Birmingham Bulls owner John Bassett to be part of the youth movement. Bassett wanted to confront the NHL by signing as many young and promising superstars as possible and saw Gretzky as the most promising young prospect. Although Bassett failed to sign Gretzky, the Bulls included several future NHL stars at the beginning of their professional careers such as Rick Vaive, Michel Goulet, Rob Ramage, Pat Riggin, Craig Hartsburg, Gaston Gingras and Rod Langway, as well as a 36-year-old Paul Henderson. Even though his team was the only one in the league not to make the playoffs, Brophy was awarded the Robert Schmertz Memorial Trophy as the WHA's coach of the year.\n\nThe Bulls were not included in the WHA-NHL merger of 1979. Even without the WHA's insistence that all of its surviving Canadian teams be included, the NHL was skeptical about putting another team in the South due to the struggles of the Atlanta Flames (who would eventually move to Calgary a year later).\n\nAfter the WHA ceased operations in 1979, the Birmingham Bulls joined the Central Hockey League, playing during the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons. The CHL team included returning coach John Brophy, and six players carried over from the previous season's WHA team, including Paul Henderson, Pat Riggin, Rick Adduono, and Dave Hanson. The team disbanded during its second season.\n\nSimultaneous with the merger, the NHL lowered its minimum age from 20 to 18, making a number of previously underage members of the Bulls eligible for the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. The Colorado Rockies used the first overall pick to select a former member of the Bulls, Rob Ramage. A total of four former Bulls were selected in the first round (including three of the first six picks), with another two Bulls being selected in the second round. The last active NHL player from the Bulls was Michel Goulet, who retired in 1994 as a member of the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nMajor professional hockey has never returned to Birmingham, although the NHL returned to the South in the 1990s in a series of expansions and franchise re-locations.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\"\n\n\n"}

It has the most important concentration of Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in mainland Scotland.\n\nThe glen is located between Oban and Lochgilphead, surrounding the village of Kilmartin. In the village, Kilmartin Museum explains the stories of this ancient landscape and the people who dwelt there.\n\nThere are more than 800 ancient monuments within a six-mile radius of the village, with 150 of them being prehistoric. Monuments include standing stones, a henge monument, numerous cists, and a \"linear cemetery\" comprising five burial cairns. Several of these, as well as many natural rocks, are decorated with cup and ring marks.\n\nThe remains of the fortress of the Scots at Dunadd, a royal centre of Dal Riata, are located to the south of the glen, on the edge of the Moine Mhòr or Great Moss. Kilmartin Museum is located within the village itself and inspires and educates people by interpreting, explaining and conserving the internationally important archaeological landscape, artefacts and natural heritage of Kilmartin Glen.\n\nThe most visible feature of the Kilmartin Glen is the linear arrangement of cairns, running over three miles south-by-south-west from the village. There are five remaining cairns in the alignment, although cropmarks and other traces suggest that there may originally have been more. The burial cairns are of Bronze Age origin, with the exception of Nether Largie South cairn, which is a Stone Age structure, rebuilt in the Bronze Age.\n\nThe most northerly cairn, Glebe is situated immediately to the west of Kilmartin Village. The cairn was excavated in 1864 by the antiquary Canon William Greenwell, and two concentric stone circles were found beneath the stones. At the centre were two cist burials, and finds recovered included a jet necklace and a decorated bowl.\n\nThis cairn was first excavated in 1929, shortly after much of the stone had been reused in roadbuilding. It is around 30m across, and was formerly 3m in height. Kerbstones, which formed the boundary of the cairn, can still be seen. Inside two cists were found, with grooved joints between the stone slabs. Cup marks, and a carving of an axehead, can be seen on the southern cist.\n\nNether Largie South is the oldest monument of the linear cemetery. It is a Neolithic chambered cairn of the Clyde type, probably dating from the fourth millennium BC. The cairn was probably originally around 40m in diameter and 4m high, although stone robbing has reduced its size. The internal chamber, subdivided into four by floor slabs, is over 6m long, around 1.7m high, and 1.8m wide at its northern end, tapering to 1.5m. Although now exposed, the chamber would have been encased within the cairn. Two cists were also located in this cairn, to the south of the chamber. Archaeological finds recovered from Nether Largie South include Neolithic pottery and arrowheads.\n\nThis is the most southerly cairn in the linear cemetery, believed locally to be the possible burial place of a King. It was built between 2200BC and 1950BC, and was more recently used as a lime kiln. Three excavations took place at the site: by Reverend Mapleton in 1870; Craw in 1929; and V. Gordon Childe in 1936. All traces of the lime kiln were removed following a reconstruction of the site.\nNether Largie standing stones are located southeast of Temple Wood stone circle and are composed of four menhirs, arranged in pairs an approximately 70 metres apart, with a single menhir in the middle. Around which are seven smaller stones and one fallen one. Another menhir is one hundred metres to the northwest leading towards the circle. Alexander Thom toured this site with Magnus Magnusson in 1970 in a BBC television documentary called \"\"Chronicle : Cracking the stone age code\"\". He suggested that it \"gave so much information that it must be regarded as one of the most important, if not the most important site in Britain\". He clarified his hypothesis that it was a lunar observatory for predicting eclipses. A reassessment of this hypothesis was carried out by Jon Patrick from Melbourne University in 1979. His conclusion was:\n\nKilmartin Glen has \"a remarkable concentration of some of the most impressive cup and ring decorated rock surfaces in Scotland\". The purpose, and even the precise date, of cup and ring marks is uncertain. They are found on natural rock surfaces at Achnabreck, Cairnbaan, Ballygowan, and Baluachraig near Kilmichael Glassary.\n\nIn 2007, Kilmartin Glen was the setting for \"Half Life\", a piece of landscape art and performance created by the Scottish theatre company NVA in collaboration with the National Theatre of Scotland.\n\n\n\n"}

At many department stores, back to school sales are advertised as a time when school supplies, children's, and young adults' clothing goes on sale. Office supplies have also become an important part of back to school sales, with the rise in prominence of personal computers and related equipment in education; traditional supplies such as paper, pens, pencils and binders will often be marked at steep discounts, often as loss leaders to entice shoppers to buy other items in the store.

After the Reformation, however, many of the stones were moved, and in 1956 they were moved inside a shelter to protect them from the weather. The symbolism of the motifs carved onto the slabs is the subject of much discussion and speculation. Many feature swords or claymores, some alone, others with surrounding designs of twining or interlaced foliage. Several depict armed men. Other motifs include crosses, animals and shears; a comb appears with shears on one stone.

He was one of their 16 children, a good number of whom went on to hold different senior positions in politics, medicine, and other sectors.\n\nAwori's eldest brother, Musa, died of a snake bite at infancy. His older brother, W.W.W. Awori, served on the Legislative Council in the 1950s. His younger brother Aggrey Awori is a politician in Uganda who came third in the presidential elections of 2001.

In February 2006 eighty Members of Parliament demanded his resignation, threatening street protests if their requests were not met. A few days later protestors on the streets of Nairobi called for his resignation as part of a wider anti-corruption demonstration. After this was not achieved, the Social Reform Centre said that he was undermining the integrity of his office in refusing to step down and promised to continue protesting.

There were two important buildings on the site. The Commercial Museum, built in 1899, was one of the original exposition buildings. The Municipal Auditorium (Convention Hall) was built in 1931; Philip H. Johnson was the architect. The site was host to national political conventions in 1900, 1936, 1940 and 1948.\n\nThe Convention Hall arena was located at 3400 Civic Center Boulevard, on the edge of the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, and just to the southwest of Franklin Field. It was built in 1930 and its highest capacity was approximately 12,000. The building was an Art Deco landmark, notable for its many friezes and other decorative aspects.\n\nOriginally known as the Municipal Auditorium, the Convention Hall hosted many events, including the 1936 and 1948 Democratic National Conventions, and the 1940 and 1948 Republican National Conventions. Thus the building became known as Convention Hall. Pope John Paul II, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela all spoke there, and The Beatles and the Philadelphia Mummers both performed there. The Philadelphia Warriors and Philadelphia 76ers both played many of their games in the arena; the 1960 NBA All-Star Game was played there.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson spoke at a campaign appearance on August 29, 1964 at Convention Hall. He appeared at the Hall alongside many notable Philadelphia and Pennsylvania Democratic leaders. Four days later, The Beatles played the venue on September 2, 1964 during their first tour of the United States. Tickets went on sale in May 1964 and sold out within 90 minutes. The Rolling Stones played Convention Hall on May 1, 1965 during their third American tour.\n\nAfter the opening of the Spectrum in South Philadelphia in 1967, the building nearly became obsolete. On February 5, 1970, The Jackson 5 played their first official concert for Motown Records there. The building was later used for Atlantic 10 Conference and Big Five basketball games. Jim Crockett Promotions, under the NWA banner, and later as the Ted Turner-owned WCW, also staged professional wrestling there, which included three pay-per-view events: Halloween Havoc in 1989 and 1992 and the 1994 Slamboree event. The Civic Center also hosted the World Hockey Association's Philadelphia Blazers and the minor-league Philadelphia Firebirds hockey teams. The University of Pennsylvania used the building for commencements (due to it being larger than Penn's own basketball arena, the nearby Palestra), as did Drexel University, Temple University, and La Salle University.\nConvention Hall was torn down in 2005, after more than a decade without a regular tenant. The 1996 Atlantic 10 Men's basketball tournament was the last event ever held there (its convention functions were taken over by the Pennsylvania Convention Center in the city's central business district); prior to this, it also hosted college basketball in the form of the 1986 MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament. Afterwards, it served as a soundstage for movies and the TV series \"Hack\" starring David Morse. The Championship fight scene for Tommy 'the machine' Gun played by real life boxer Tommy Morrison for the 1990 movie \"Rocky V\" was shot there.\n\nThe Auditorium's M.P. Moller 86-rank pipe organ, built in 1931, was removed just prior to the building's demolition and placed in Pennsylvania Hall in temporary storage. In October 2006 the organ was donated to the University of Oklahoma's, American Organ Institute where it will be restored and become the centerpiece of their music programs.\n\nThe last remnant of the Civic Center, Pennsylvania Hall (built in 1978), was imploded on March 4, 2007. The University of Pennsylvania Health System's Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine opened on the site in October 2008.\n\nOne limestone frieze that adorned the Civic Center, tall and long and depicting the history of labor from the days of the ancient Egyptians to the 20th century, was carefully removed before the building was demolished. It was purchased by the Alessi Organization in 2005 and in 2017 was installed outside its new Crossing Shopping Center at East 22nd Street and Route 440 in Bayonne, New Jersey.\n\n"}

Zindel received the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and a New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for the work.\n\nThe play's world premiere happened in the 1964/1965 season at the Alley Theatre in Houston.\n\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at the Mercer Arts Center on April 7, 1970 and closed on May 14, 1972 after 819 performances. Directed by Melvin Bernhardt, the cast featured Swoosie Kurtz (Janice Vickery), Amy Levitt (Ruth), Judith Lowry (Nanny), Pamela Payton-Wright (Tillie), and Sada Thompson (Beatrice).\n\nThe play was presented on Broadway at the Biltmore Theatre, from March 9, 1978 (previews) to March 26, 1978. Directed by A. J. Antoon, the cast included Shelley Winters (Beatrice), Carol Kane (Tillie), Lolly Boroff (Janice Vickery), Isabella Hoopes (Nanny), and Lori Shelle (Ruth).\n\nIt was adapted for the screen in 1972, directed by Paul Newman and starring his wife Joanne Woodward, daughter Nell Potts, and Roberta Wallach, daughter of Eli Wallach. Woodward won the award for Best Actress at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe play revolves around a dysfunctional family consisting of single mother Beatrice and her two daughters, Ruth and Tillie, who try to cope with their abysmal status in life. The play is a lyrical drama, reminiscent of Tennessee Williams' style.\n\nShy Matilda Hunsdorfer, nicknamed Tillie, prepares an experiment involving marigolds raised from seeds exposed to radioactivity for her science fair. She is, however, constantly thwarted by her mother Beatrice, who is self-centered and abusive, and by her extroverted and unstable sister Ruth, who submits to her mother's will. Over the course of the play, Beatrice constantly tries to stamp out any opportunities Tillie has of succeeding, due to her own lack of success in life. As the play progresses, the paths of the three characters diverge: Tillie wins the science fair through perseverance; Ruth attempts to stand up to her mother but has a nervous collapse at the end of the play, and Beatrice—driven to the verge of insanity by her deep-seated enmity towards everyone—kills the girls' pet rabbit Peter and ends up wallowing in her own perceived insignificance. Despite this, Tillie (who is much like her project's deformed but beautiful and hardy marigolds) secretly continues to believe that everyone is valuable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Newman produced and directed a film adaptation of the play from a screenplay by Alvin Sargent.

The challenging sound on the single was not characteristic of the popular Britpop bands of the time. The departure of guitarist Bernard Butler, ahead of its release, overshadowed the single somewhat. That event, along with the song's music video receiving little airplay, contributed to its relatively poor charting, although still managing a No. 18 peak.\n\nSinger and co-writer Brett Anderson has said he wrote it while he was living in Highgate. It is a song about revolution and the juxtaposition between the middle class lives of Highgate and the council estates of the not too far away Archway.

The video for the b-side, Killing Of A Flash Boy, was shot on Hackneys Nightingale Estate.\n\nThe single was very well-received in the British press. David Sinclair of \"The Times\" wrote: \"Propelled by one of Bernard Butler's finest riff chord sequences and fuelled by the nightmare visions of Brett Anderson's lyric, the song romps home with a glorious chorus that combines old-fashioned sing-a-long appeal with an intriguingly sinister edge.\" Caroline Sullivan's review in \"The Guardian\" was printed the day before the band announced Oakes as their new guitarist. In it she predicted it would be the band's swansong. However, she was very favourable, saying: \"It's a typically melodramatic affair, Butler's squawking playing counterpointed by Brett Anderson's breastbeating emoting.

{"id": "1955144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955144", "title": "Ab Urbe Condita Libri", "text": "Ab Urbe Condita Libri\n\nThe book History of Rome, sometimes referred to as Ab Urbe Condita (\"[Books] from the Founding of the City\"), is a monumental history of ancient Rome, written in Latin between 27 and 9 BC by the historian Titus Livius, or \"Livy\", as he is usually known in English. The work covers the period from the legends concerning the arrival of Aeneas and the refugees from the fall of Troy, to the city's founding in 753, the expulsion of the Kings in 509, and down to Livy's own time, during the reign of the emperor Augustus. The last event covered by Livy is the death of Drusus in 9 BC. About 25% of the work survives (35 books of 142). The surviving books deal with the events down to 293 BC, and from 219 to 166 BC.\n\nThe \"History of Rome\" originally comprised 142 \"books\", thirty-five of which—Books 1–10 with the Preface and Books 21–45—still exist in reasonably complete form. Damage to a manuscript of the 5th century resulted in large gaps (\"lacunae\") in Books 41 and 43–45 (small lacunae exist elsewhere); that is, the material is not covered in any source of Livy's text.\n\nA fragmentary palimpsest of the 91st book was discovered in the Vatican Library in 1772, containing about a thousand words (roughly three paragraphs), and several papyrus fragments of previously unknown material, much smaller, have been found in Egypt since 1900, most recently about 40 words from Book 11, unearthed in 1986.\n\nSome passages are nevertheless known thanks to quotes from ancient authors, the most famous being on the death of Cicero, quoted by Seneca the Elder.\n\nLivy was abridged, in antiquity, to an epitome, which survives for Book 1, but was itself abridged in the fourth century into the so-called \"Periochae\", which is simply a list of contents. The \"Periochae\" survive for the entire work, except for books 136 and 137. In Oxyrhynchus, a similar summary of books 37–40, 47–55, and only small fragments of 88 was found on a roll of papyrus that is now in the British Museum classified as P.Oxy.IV 0668. There is another fragment, named P.Oxy.XI 1379, which represents a passage from the first book (I, 6) and that shows a high level of correctness. However the Oxyrhynchus Epitome is damaged and incomplete.\n\nThe entire work covers the following periods:\n\nBooks 1–5 – The legendary founding of Rome (including the landing of Aeneas in Italy and the founding of the city by Romulus), the period of the kings, and the early republic down to its conquest by the Gauls in 390 BC.\n\nBooks 6–10 – Wars with the Aequi, Volsci, Etruscans, and Samnites, down to 292 BC.\n\nBooks 11–20 – The period from 292 to 218, including the First Punic War (lost).\n\nBooks 21–30 – The Second Punic War, from 218 to 202.\n\nBooks 31–45 – The Macedonian and other eastern wars from 201 to 167.\n\n\"Books 46 to 142 are all lost:\"\n\nBooks 46–70 – The period from 167 to the outbreak of the Social War in 91.\n\nBooks 71–90 – The civil wars between Marius and Sulla, to the death of Sulla in 78.\n\nBooks 91–108 – From 78 BC through the end of the Gallic War, in 50.\n\nBooks 109–116 – From the Civil War to the death of Caesar (49–44).\n\nBooks 117-133 – The wars of the triumvirs down to the death of Antonius (44–30).\n\nBooks 134-142 – The rule of Augustus down to the death of Drusus (9).\n\nLivy wrote in a mixture of annual chronology and narrative, often interrupting a story to announce the elections of new consuls. Collins defines the \"annalistic method\" as \"naming the public officers and recording the events of each succeeding year\". It is an expansion of the fasti, the official public chronicles kept by the magistrates, which were a primary source for Roman historians. Those who seem to have been more influenced by the method have been termed annalists.\n\nThe first and third decades (see below) of Livy's work are written so well that Livy has become a \"sine qua non\" of curricula in Golden Age Latin. Some have argued that subsequently the quality of his writing began to decline, and that he becomes repetitious and wordy. Of the 91st book Barthold Georg Niebuhr says \"repetitions are here so frequent in the small compass of four pages and the prolixity so great, that we should hardly believe it to belong to Livy...\" Niebuhr accounts for the decline by supposing \"the writer has grown old and become loquacious...\", going so far as to conjecture that the later books were lost because copyists refused to copy such low-quality work.\n\nA digression in Book 9, Sections 17–19, suggests that the Romans would have beaten Alexander the Great if he had lived longer and had turned west to attack the Romans, making this digression the oldest known alternate history.\n\nThe first five books were published between 27 and 25 BC. The first date mentioned is the year Augustus received that title: twice in the first five books Livy uses it. For the second date, Livy lists the closings of the temple of Janus but omits that of 25 (it had not happened yet).\n\nLivy continued to work on the \"History\" for much of the rest of his life, publishing new material by popular demand. This explains why the work falls naturally into 12 packets, mainly groups of 10 books, or decades, sometimes of 5 books (pentads or ) and the rest without any packet order. The scheme of dividing it entirely into decades is a later innovation of copyists.\n\nThe second pentad did not come out until 9 or after, some 16 years after the first pentad. In Book IX Livy states that the Cimminian Forest was more impassable than the German had been recently, referring to the Hercynian Forest (Black Forest) first opened by Drusus and Ahenobarbus. One can only presume that in the interval Livy's first pentad had been such a success that he had to yield to the demand for more.\n\nThere is no uniform system of classifying and naming manuscripts. Often the relationship of one manuscript (MS) to another remains unknown or changes as perceptions of the handwriting change. Livy's release of chapters by packet diachronically encouraged copyists to copy by decade. Each decade has its own conventions, which do not necessarily respect the conventions of any other decade. A family of MSS descend through copying from the same MSS (typically lost). MSS vary widely; to produce an emendation or a printed edition was and is a major task. Usually variant readings are given in footnotes.\n\nAll of the manuscripts (except one) of the first ten books (first decade) of \"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\", which were copied through the Middle Ages and were used in the first printed editions, are derived from a single recension commissioned by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, consul, AD 391. A recension is made by comparing extant manuscripts and producing a new version, an emendation, based on the text that seems best to the editor. The latter then \"subscribed\" to the new MS by noting on it that he had emended it.\n\nSymmachus, probably using the authority of his office, commissioned Tascius Victorianus to emend the first decade. Books I–IX bear the subscription \"Victorianus emendabam dominis Symmachis\", \"I Victorianus emended (this) by the authority of Symmachus.\" Books VI–VIII include another subscription preceding it, that of Symmachus' son-in-law, Nicomachus Flavianus, and Books III–V were also emended by Flavianus' son, Appius Nicomachus Dexter, who says he used his relative Clementianus' copy. This recension and family of descendant MSS is called the Nicomachean, after two of the subscribers. From it several MSS descend (incomplete list):\n\nEpigraphists go on to identify several hands and lines of descent. A second family of the first decade consists of the Verona Palimpsest, reconstructed and published by Theodore Mommsen, 1868; hence the Veronensis MSS. It includes 60 leaves of Livy fragments covering Books III-VI. The handwriting style is dated to the 4th century, only a few centuries after Livy.\n\nIn the Middle Ages there were constant rumors that the complete books of the History of Livy lay hidden in the library of a Danish or German Monastery. One individual even affirmed under oath in the court of Martin V that he had seen the whole work, written in Lombardic script, in a monastery in Denmark. All of these rumors were later found to be unsubstantiated.\n\nThe details of Livy's \"History of Rome\" vary from arguably legendary or perhaps even mythical stories at the beginning to detailed accounts of certainly real events toward the end. He himself noted the difficulty of finding information about events some 700 years or more removed from the author. Of his material on early Rome he said \"The traditions of what happened prior to the foundation of the City or whilst it was being built, are more fitted to adorn the creations of the poet than the authentic records of the historian.\" The first book has been one of the most significant sources of the various accounts of the traditional legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nNevertheless, according to the tradition of writing history at the time, he felt obliged to relate what he read (or heard) without passing judgment as to its truth or untruth. One of the problems of modern scholarship is to ascertain where in the work the line is to be drawn between legendary and historical. One view has been that buildings, inscriptions, monuments and libraries prior to the sack of Rome in 387 BC by the Gauls under Brennus were destroyed by that sack and were scarcely available to Livy and his sources. This view originates from Livy himself, who notes this fact. A layer of ash over the lowest pavement of the comitium believed to date from that time seemed to confirm a citywide destruction.\n\nA new view by Tim Cornell, however, deemphasizes the damage caused by the Gauls under Brennus. Among other reasons, he asserts that the Gauls' interest in movable plunder, rather than destruction, kept damage to a minimum. The burnt layer under the comitium is now dated to the 6th century BC. There apparently is no archaeological evidence of a widespread destruction of Rome by the Gauls. Cornell uses this information to affirm the historicity of Livy's account of the 5th and 4th centuries BC.\n\nFor the first decade, Livy studied the works of a group of historians in or near his own time, known as annalists. Some twelve historians in this category are named by Livy in Book I as sources on the period of the monarchy. In date order backward from Livy they are: Gaius Licinius Macer, Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius, Valerius Antias, Gnaeus Gellius, Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus (consul 129 BC), Lucius Cassius Hemina, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133), Aulus Postumius Albinus (consul 151), Gaius Acilius Glabrio, Marcus Porcius Cato, Lucius Cincius Alimentus, Quintus Fabius Pictor. Elsewhere he mentions Sempronius Asellio. Macer, the latest of these, died in 66. Fabius, the earliest, fought in the Gallic War of 225.\n\nLivy's sources were by no means confined to the annalists. Other historians of his time mention documents then extant dating as far back as the Roman monarchy. These include treaties between Servius Tullius and the Latins, between Lucius Tarquinius Superbus and Gabii, three between Rome and Carthage, and one between Cassius and the Latins, 493, which was engraved in bronze. In addition the Pontifex Maximus kept the Annales Maximi (yearly events) on display in his house, the censors kept the Commentarii Censorum, the praetors kept their own records, the Commentarii Pontificum and Libri Augurales were available as well as all the laws on stone or brass; the fasti (list of magistrates) and the Libri Lintei, historical records kept in the temple of Juno Moneta.\n\nNevertheless, the accounts of Rome's early history are for the most part incomplete and therefore suspect (in this view). Seeley argues, \"It is when Livy's account is compared with the accounts of other writers that we become aware of the utter uncertainty which prevailed among the Romans themselves... The traditional history, as a whole, must be rejected...\" As Livy stated that he used what he found without passing judgement on his sources, attacks on the credibility of Livy often begin with the annalists. Opinions vary. T.J. Cornell presumes that Livy relied on \"unscrupulous annalists\" who \"did not hesitate to invent a series of face-saving victories.\" Furthermore, he argues, \"The annalists of the first century BC are thus seen principally as entertainers...\" Cornell does not follow this view consistently, as he is willing to accept Livy as history for the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. A more positive view of the same limitations was given by Howard:The annalists were not modern historians, and not one of them is absolutely free from the faults attributed to Antias. That any of them, even Antias, deliberately falsified history is extremely improbable, but they were nearly all strong partisans, and of two conflicting stories it was most natural for them to choose the one which was most flattering to the Romans, or even to their own political party, and, as the principle of historical writing even in the time of Quintilian was stated to be that history was closely akin to poetry and was written to tell a story, not to prove it, we may safely assume that all writers were prone to choose the account which was most interesting and which required the least work in verification.\n\nFor the third decade, Livy followed the account of the Greek historian Polybius, as did the historical accounts of Marcus Tullius Cicero. Polybius had access to Greek sources in the eastern Mediterranean, outside the local Roman traditions.\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli's work on republics, the \"Discourses on Livy\", is presented as a commentary on the \"History of Rome\".\n\nThe first complete rendering of \"Ab Urbe Condita\" into English was Philemon Holland's translation published in 1600. According to Considine, 'it was a work of great importance, presented in a grand folio volume of 1458 pages, and dedicated to the Queen'.\n\nA notable translation of Livy titled \"History of Rome\" was made by B.O. Foster in 1919 for the Loeb Classical Library. A partial but important translation by Aubrey de Sélincourt was printed in 1960–1965 for Penguin Classics.\n\nAn online English translation is available.\n\n\n\n"}

He called upon his oldest son Johnny Buss and long-time California Sports executive Ron Weinstein to bring indoor soccer to Los Angeles. In 1981, Buss was awarded an expansion franchise at the same August league meetig where the MISL granted a one-year leave of absence to the Philadelphia Fever. Buss and Weinstein named the team the Los Angeles Lazers, and the team began play in the fall of 1982. The team's name stemmed from the up-and-coming laser light show industry, which management believed would depict a perfect synergy of the lightning fast pace of indoor soccer. It became a pre-game ritual for every Lazers game to have a laser show displayed on the walls of the Forum, which even intrigued Neil Diamond enough to visit the Lazer offices in order to investigate and ultimately incorporate this new laser technology into his own onstage live performances. Following in the footsteps of the \"Showtime\" Los Angeles Lakers, the Lazers drew many celebrities to their games including Cher, James Caan, Ricky Schroeder and Diamond. The \"Laker Girls\" performed double duty from 1982 to 1989, performing as the \"Lazer Girls\" at all home games. This opportunity played an integral part in the career of Paula Abdul, who was the lead dancer and choreographer of the team.\n\nJohnny Buss was president of the Lazers from 1982 to 1985, when he went on to pursue other endeavors. His younger brother, Jim Buss, took over as president for the 1985–86 season. In 1986, Jerry Buss attended his first MISL Board of Governors meeting. He strongly suggested to the board that they begin to reduce player salaries and gradually move the league into the summer months. Dr. Buss continued to play for three more seasons, and, after recognizing the MISL was not moving in the proper direction, in the summer of 1989, he shared with Lazers executive vice president, Ron Weinstein, that he was closing the doors on the Lazers. He told Weinstein that if he ever wanted to start a professional indoor soccer league that played in the summer months with a fiscally responsible budget, then he would mentor him while tying the new league into the NBA and NHL. Thus, the seed was planted in Ron for the founding of the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL).\n\nThe Lazers played their home games in The Forum in Inglewood, California.\n\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nIn their inaugural season, the Lazers games were broadcast on Cable Radio Network. Beginning in the second season, Bill MacDonald asked Buss and Weinstein for permission to broadcast the Lazers home games on KBOB radio in Pasadena. MacDonald's family agreed to purchase the air time, and MacDonald's long running career was launched. During the 1983–84 season, the Lazers made the first entree into the television arena by broadcasting a few games on the Lakers and Kings KCAL 9 television network. Chick Hearn, the Lakers broadcaster, and Bob Miller, the Kings broadcaster, shared the play-by-play responsibilities. During the 1984–85 season, the Lazers began to broadcast their games on Prime Ticket, which was the regional sports network created by Dr. Jerry Buss for Southern California. This first Lazers broadcast was only the second event to have ever been aired on the Prime Ticket Network. Joel Meyers, a new and upcoming telecaster, joined MacDonald to become the dynamic team that announced every play from then on for the Lazers.\n"}

The team, renamed the Americans, played in Memphis through the end of the 1984 season before relocating to Las Vegas, but retained the name \"Americans\".\n\nThe team's first coach was German Horst Bertl, who was an experienced player and coach from the Bundesliga, but new to indoor soccer. In the later years to save money the team's general manager, Kyle Rote Jr, would coach the team.\n\nThe team was primarily stocked with talented foreign players such as Tony Carbognani, Helmut Dudek and Stan Stamenkovic. Some Hartford players came with the franchise to Memphis, including Thomas Nevers, Hank Liotart and Bruce Rudroff. The Memphis franchise added young Americans like number one draft choice Mike Garrett and Steve Allison along with more experienced pros to round out the first year roster.

A new group of owners were added shortly after that and included local owners that would provide more attention to franchise operations. In year two the team continued to compete at around .500 and play attractive soccer. After the end of their third season, the team was moved to Las Vegas – where they only lasted one additional year.\n\nSeveral Memphis players continued to play professionally after the Memphis team were Carbognani (MISL) and National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), Stamenkovic, Kunovac, Garrett (NPSL player coach with Toledo and Kalamazoo) and Dudek. The team was very entertaining and talented – Stamenkovic dubbed \"The Magician\" for his ball handling skills was amazing to see in action and the best-known of the players on the team. Dudek was a strong defender but was most noticed because he had such a powerful shot. Garrett was a young American with great skills and Carbognani was very good at passing and controlling the ball. Richard But was the primary goalkeeper and had some great games. Bill Mishalow was the backup goalkeeper who was formidable in his own right. Art Hughes a native of Memphis was also an asset on the field and off. Hughes dubbed \"The Denier\" for his ability to block shots was also used off the field as ambassador to the Memphis City Schools and helped establish the school systems inaugural soccer programs.\n\nThe Americans average attendance in Memphis was 5,763 in their three years before moving to Las Vegas and becoming the Las Vegas Americans.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Zungul was a seasoned outdoor player from HNK Hajduk Split who had gained the approval of the Yugoslavia Football Federation to play outside of his native country for a few months. When he refused to return to Hajduk, the Yugoslavia Football Federation obtained a ruling from FIFA forbidding any outdoor team from signing him.

Only the Houston Summit had a better record, but it was the Arrows who took the title, defeating the Philadelphia Fever.\n\nThe Arrows finished first in their division the next three years, before taking the titles over the Houston Summit (1979–80) and the St. Louis Steamers (1980–81 and 1981–82).\n\nWhile the Arrows dominated the league as a team, several Arrows players gained repeated individual recognition. In his four seasons with the Arrows, Steve Zungul, \"The Lord of All Indoors\", regularly scored nearly five goals per game and in one instance, scored seven in a game versus the Chicago Horizons in 1981. His scoring exploits led to his selection as League MVP four times running. He was also the four time league scoring leader and a two time assists leader. While Zungul was head and shoulders above nearly every other player in the league, he was not the only Arrows great. Shep Messing was the first championship series MVP and a perennial all star. His replacement, Zoltan Toth, was the 1982–1983 Goalkeeper of the Year. Juli Veee was an outstanding midfielder while Branko Šegota was a perennial All Star. However, these are merely a handful of great Arrows players.\n\nThough a powerhouse on the field, they were not a powerhouse at the box office. Shortly after the team won its fourth and final MISL title, the team was sold. In January 1983, the team traded Steve Zungul to the San Jose Earthquakes for Gary Etherington and Gordon Hill. While billed as a move to \"Americanize\" the Arrows, it was largely a cost saving device. While Zungul went on to become the NASL League MVP in 1984, the Arrows collapsed and folded at the end of the season. The six seasons in the MISL the Arrows avg. 6,440 per game.\n\nTheir home arena was Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York.\n\n\n\nMISL Championship\n\nLeague MVP\n\nChampionship MVP\n\nScoring Champion\n\nPass Master (Assists Leader)\n\nDefender of the Year\n\nGoalkeeper of the Year\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nFirst Team All MISL\n\n\n"}

Alternative names are Rudari (Ludari), Lingurari and Zlătari.\n\nThe Boyash are a branch/caste of the Roma who were forced to settle in the 14th century in the Apuseni Mountains, located in Transylvania, and work as slaves in mining (a regionalism for \"mine\" in Romanian: \"baie,\" from Middle Age Slavonic). \n\nAt the end of the 16th century the Boyash started migrating towards the south, in Wallachia, and the east, in Moldavia, where they were held as slaves together with other Romani groups (until the slavery was abolished in 1855-56).\n\nAnother name for the Boyash, \"Rudari\", comes from the Slavic \"ruda\" (\"metal\", \"ore\"). As the mines became inefficient, the Boyash people were forced to readjust by earning their living making wood utensils (\"Lingurari\" means \"spoon-makers\" in Romanian; also cf. Serbian \"ruda\", Hungarian \"rúd\", Romanian \"rudă\" meaning \"relative\", but also \"rod, pole, stick\"). The nickname \"Kashtale\" (\"wood-workers\") was also given to them by the Romani-speaking Roma and it has remained in Romani as a more general word for a Rom who does not speak Romani.\n\nAfter the point at which they began to make wood tools they scattered themselves in isolated communities. The consequence of this is that nowadays they speak a distinct archaic dialect of Romanian, with borrowings from other surrounding languages.\n\nAfter the liberation of the Roma from slavery (by the middle of the 19th century), many emigrated to other countries, especially Hungary and the Balkans, but also as far as the Americas, South Africa and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, about 14,000 of the 280,000 recorded Hungarian Roma were Boyash.\n\nIn Croatia, the Boyash are settled in several small communities along the Hungarian border in the regions of Međimurje, the Podravina, Slavonija and Baranja with an overflow of settlers living in the Apatin county of Vojvodina, Serbia. 2005 saw the Boyash language of Croatia published in its own alphabet for the first time in the Catholic Catechism, published by the HBK Glas Koncila in Zagreb. In 2007, the first Bible—a children's Bible—was published by OM EAST in Austria and facilitated by The Romani Bible Union.\n\nIn English, the commonly accepted name for the ethnic group is \"Boyash\", however in contemporary Bulgaria the terms \"Ludari\" and \"Rudari\" are in common use, while in Romania both terms are present in some form: \"Rudari\" and \"Băieşi\".\n\nFor the same ethnic group in Hungary and Croatia the terms \"Beyash\" and \"Bayash\" (Bajaši) are now officially used. The ethnonym \"Banyash\" (\"miner\") in Serbia is known only among the group settled in Bačka region, living along the river Danube, near the border with Croatia and Hungary. This term is only sporadically understood, and not used among some other Banyash groups in the Serbian Banat region, e.g. the village of Uljma.\n\nThey are also known by many appellations based on trades; in addition to Rudari/Ludari (\"miners\", from Serbian and Bulgarian \"ruda\" \"ore, metal\") they are known as \"Kopanari\" (\"cradle-makers\", from Serbian and Bulgarian \"kopanja\" \"wooden box\"), \"Koritari\" (\"trough-makers\"), \"Lingurara\" (\"spoon-makers\", cf. Romanian \"lingură\" \"spoon\") and \"Ursari\" (cf. Romanian \"urs\" \"bear\") or \"Mechkara\" (\"bear-trainers\").\n\nEducation in the Romanian language is available only for the Banyash living in Romanian villages in the Serbian Banat, as well as in Hungary, in the \"beás\" subdialect of the Romanian language spoken by Boyash communities in (central and western) Hungary.\n\nDuring the last few years there have been several attempts on behalf of local non-governmental organizations in East Bačka region to introduce optional classes in Romanian. According to 2004 field research data, only two such projects are still going on there: optional classes in Romanian in the village of Vajska, and kindergarten in the local Ardeal dialect in Bački Monoštor, attended by 20 pupils altogether.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=M10xAQAAIAAJ&q=boyash+gypsies&dq=boyash+gypsies&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZy9Wv38zkAhWEup4KHb5SBPYQ6AEIKTAA Studies about Boyash Gypsies in Hungary book\nhttps://books.google.com › books\n\nZsuzsanna Bódi - 1997]\n"}

He used to play as a goalkeeper.\n\nHe amassed 86 appearances for the Romania national team between 1998 and 2018, representing the country in two European Championships. He was popularly nicknamed \"Motanul\" (\"The Tomcat\") in Romania, due to his quick reflexes and relative small body frame for a goalkeeper.\n\nLobonț began his career with hometown club Corvinul Hunedoara in the Romanian Liga II. He remained with the team until 1997, when he moved to Liga I club Rapid București. Lobonț enjoyed success there, winning the 1998–99 league title.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Lobonț was transferred by Dutch club AFC Ajax, for a fee of €3 million. Injury and inexperience, however, kept him out of the starting team, and he was loaned to Dinamo București for the 2001–02 season.\n\nUpon his return to Ajax, he became the team's primary goalkeeper. Although Lobonț struggled with occasional injuries, he played well when healthy in both the Eredivisie and the UEFA Champions League.\n\nIn January 2006, Lobonț was sold from Ajax to Italian Serie A club ACF Fiorentina, which needed a goalkeeper after the injury of starting goalkeeper Sébastien Frey. Although he played particularly well, Frey's return meant that he would spend most of the time as a substitute.\n\nBecause he had also lost his place on the Romania national team, Lobonț made a surprise move back to Dinamo București in January 2007 and helped the club win the Liga I.\n\nOn 31 August 2009, Italian Serie A team A.S. Roma signed Lobonț in a co-ownership deal from Dinamo, with an option for the club to buy him outright at the end of the season, for a fee of €1.5 million. He made his first appearance for the \"Giallorossi\" on 4 October, coming off the bench after 23 minutes in a game against Napoli. On 4 March 2012, he came on against Lazio because of Stekelenburg's red card. Because of starter Maarten Stekelenburg's injury, he was the temporary first goalkeeper in seven matches in the 2011–12 season.\n\nOn 1 July 2013, Lobonț signed a new three-year contract with Roma which would keep him at the club until 2016.\nEven though he had not featured in an Roma match for about four years, in 2016 he extended his contract with the team yet again, making Roma the last team of his playing career.\n\nLobonț was part of Romania national team's UEFA Euro 2000 and Euro 2008 squads. He turned in a particularly strong performance in Romania's group stage game in Euro 2008 against world champions Italy, saving numerous well-placed shots and keeping his team's tournament hopes alive with a 1–1 draw.\n\nLobonț played an important part for the national team, earning over 80 caps, starting from 1998. In May 2014, after fifteen years of service, he announced his retirement from the Romania national team, citing his age as an important factor. In September 2017, after coach Christoph Daum's sacking, he was called to be part of the national squad in the final two matches of the World Cup 2018 qualification stage.\n\nHe retired from professional football on 5 June 2018, earning his final cap for Romania in a 2–0 friendly win against Finland at the Ilie Oană Stadium in Ploiești.\n\nRapid București\n\nAjax\n\nDinamo București\n\n"}

Morland's beers include Hen's Tooth, Old Speckled Hen, Tanner's Jack and Morland's Original.\n\nJohn Morland founded the brewery in 1711. In the 1860s, Morland bought Abbey Brewery and Eagle Brewery and in 1885 changed its name to United Breweries. The company bought several more breweries and around 1944 changed its name back to Morland. In 1979, Morland created Old Speckled Hen, one of their most popular beers. \n\nAs one of the Morland properties, the Ock Street brewery in Abingdon was sold to Greene King, who immediately revealed plans to close it. The company said it would transfer the Ruddles and Old Speckled Hen brands to its own brewery in Bury St Edmunds. It was indeed soon closed and converted into residential housing.\n\nA farmer, John Morland, set up the brewery in 1711, and the ale and porter was bought by pubs in London. In the 1860s, Morland acquired Abbey Brewery and then Eagle Brewery. In the 1880s, Morland moved its operation from West Ilsley to Abingdon.\n\nIn 1885, Morland became a limited company and changed its name to United Breweries and its trademark to a pyramid of three beer barrels, with the initials of the three breweries on the ends of them. In 1889, the company took over two brewers, H. B. Saxby and Field & Sons, keeping their names on the labels of their beers.\nMorland acquired Field & Son brewery based at Shillingford near Wallingford. Thomas Skurray, at the age of 19, came with Field & Son. After 10 years at Abingdon Thomas Skurray was running everything apart from the offices. He was chairman of the board until his death in 1938 and was to build a new malthouse and a soft drinks factory.\n\nThomas Skurray had a son, Thomas Edward Deane Skurray, who was a partner in a company called Theobold & Skurray, a company of Architects. \nDeane was responsible for the building of many new pubs in the 1930s: The Saxton Arms, Abingdon; the Ox, Oxford Road, Abingdon; the Royal Oak, Didcot; the Old White Hart at Hook; the New Inn at Longworth and the Bystander at Wootton, Abingdon, also looking after over 300 other Morland pubs & hotels.\n\nMorland bought more breweries:\n\nIn 1944, United-Breweries became a public limited company called Morland and Co plc, and all the acquired brewery names were dropped except Ferguson's Ltd, which was retained for the wine and spirits business, and Bass-Charrington Brewery which was kept separate because of its expensive new distribution warehouse. In 1997 Morland purchased Ruddles Brewers and moved their production from Oakham to Abingdon. In 2000 Morland and Co plc was sold to Greene King brewery. This led to the closure of the Abingdon brewery and the transfer of production to Bury St. Edmunds.\n\nThe Morland's sign, showing an artist with his palette, commemorated George Morland who was a noted artist and painter. \"Artist's Keg\" bitter was also brewed during the 1980s and 1990s. These can still be seen today on many old Morland public houses.\n\nIn 1991, Morland and Co plc purchased 101 pubs from Courage Ltd and a further 100 were added two years later from Whitbread. More purchases were made in the mid 1990s, and also a number of restaurants nationwide. Morland opened their own restaurants called \"'Artist Fayre\" as well as another 100 pubs from Whitbread & co Plc.'. Morland Plc owned over five hundred pubs when the brewery closed in 2000.\n\nA large wooden house built for head brewer James Dymore Brown great grand son of Jas Dymore Brown Reading Brewery once lived in was demolished when the company built a large air-conditioned draught beer warehouse.

They were in turn replaced by a new team called the Wichita B-52s who play in the Major Arena Soccer League.\n\nLocal Wichita news sources (KWCH, KAKE) have confirmed that yet another new Wichita Wings will be making a return to professional soccer for the upcoming 2019-20 season, although they have not made public which league they will be playing in.\n\nThe team hosted the NPSL All-Star Game in 1996 and 1999.\n\nIn 1978, Tom Marshall, a local youth soccer promoter with the American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), convinced the North American Soccer League's (NASL) Dallas Tornado to come to Wichita to play an exhibition game. Proceeds from the event would benefit the local AYSO organization. On December 1, the Tornado squared off against the Houston Hurricane at the Kansas Coliseum. It was Roy Turner’s last game as a professional. Over the next year, Marshall and other soccer enthusiasts, including Jackie Knapp, worked to find investors and bring a professional soccer team to Wichita. Bob Becker, the owner of Great Plains Corporation, an oil marketing operation, agreed to fund the new team. The newly-christened Wichita Wings joined the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) in 1979, the league’s second year of operation.\n\nBecker hired Roy Turner as head coach and brought in Ward Lawrence to help oversee operations. Tom Marshall became the Wings’ general manager. On November 23, 1979, with only a week to go before the opening game, Marshall ceased to be a part of the Wings organization. The Wings and Marshall disagreed on the details of the separation, but it was to be permanent. Ward Lawrence took over as general manager and Becker brought in Ray Denton to help run day-to-day operations. Mike Ivanow was to be the first signing, but the paperwork sent to his home misspelled his name. The delay resulted in Norman Piper becoming the first Wichita Wing. Piper was joined by the former Dallas Tornado and Liverpool player Kevin Kewley, who became the team's captain. Former Manchester United forward Jimmy Ryan and Argentinian phenom Omar Gomez anchored the team's offense. Roy Turner brought on George Ley as a player-coach. Later in the season, the team added former Manchester United winger Willie Anderson and forward Andy Chapman. Chapman had signed with Arsenal at age 16 and would become a fan favorite in Wichita, becoming the fifth leading scorer in Wings history. Ivanow would be joined in goal by Keith Van Eron. Though Ivanow had US Olympic experience, Van Eron would end up playing more time in goal.\n\nThe Wings would end the season at 16-16, barely making the quarterfinals of the playoffs. The Detroit Lightning faced the Wings in that one-game playoff. A victory propelled the Wings into the semifinals, where they would lose the first two games of a three-game series against the Houston Summit. In addition to the Wings' playoff loss, the city of Wichita was faced with the potential loss of the franchise. Owner Bob Becker announced that he would no longer be involved with the team and was attempting to sell the team. Fans and civic leaders began a campaign to sell season tickets for the next year, with hopes that this would help convince a new owner that the people of Wichita wanted to keep the Wings. On April 16, 1980, it was announced that Pizza Hut co-founder Frank Carney and a group of investors would buy the team. The Wings would return for a second season.\n\nBob Becker's departure as owner brought wholesale change to the organization. Ward Lawrence, Ray Denton, and Jackie Knapp all departed. Frank Carney brought Bill Kentling with him from Pizza Hut to take over the role of general manager. Kentling had previously served as Director of Corporate Communications at Pizza Hut and, prior to that, the vice-president of the National Baseball Congress. Kentling brought in Director of Media Relations Steve Shaad, Director of Sales and Marketing Dave Bennett, and Director of Operations Virginia Creamer to help run the team. Future KWCH sports director Bruce Haertl became the radio voice of the Wings on KFH radio.\n\nOn the field, the Wings looked to athletes from Denmark to help improve the team. Bundesliga veteran Jorgen Kristensen and a young talent named Kim Røntved made a huge impact on the team. Kristensen would become the MISL Passmaster while Røntved was twice named MISL Defender of the Year and would become the Wings' all-time leader in goals scored. Mike Dowler from Wales secured the goalkeeper position after a battle with Keith Van Eron. Dowler would earn an MISL record four shutouts in his career with the Wings. The team's popularity increased in the 1980-81 season in part due to a controversy involving the San Francisco Fog's forward Mike Mancini. On December 28, 1980, in a Wings blowout win, Mancini punched Jorgen Kristensen hard enough to drop him to the ground. The incident was televised, thus leading to a great deal of media coverage. Bill Kentling credited this incident with helping to improve attendance. That season was the beginning of the Wings' epic rivalry with the St. Louis Steamers. The Wings would meet St. Louis in the semifinals of the 1981 playoffs. In the third and decisive game, the Steamers would come from behind to beat the Wings in a shootout. The game was marred by an ugly foul against Mike Dowler, sending him to the bench for the remainder of the game. Many considered it the greatest game in MISL history.\n\nThe 1981-82 season saw the Wings bring in two Englishmen that had a lasting impact on the team. Sheffield United alum Terry Nicholl became known as \"The General\" during his time in Wichita due to his ability to coach on the field. Jeff Bourne was a potent scorer who had played in the English first division with Derby County. The Danish connection continued to bear fruit as the Wings added midfielder Frank Rasmussen to the squad. That year's Wings squad was very successful, finishing with a 27-17 record. Though the Wings would defeat the Memphis Americans in the playoff quarterfinals, they would once again fall to the Steamers in the semis. Off the field, a new force provided a strong backbone to the Wings efforts. The Orange Army, a group of dedicated fans, followed the Wings wherever they went. They would famously meet the Wings at the airport upon the team's return from every road trip.\n\nOmar Gomez returned to the Wings for the 1982-83 season, after spending time playing for the New York Arrows. He would end the year second on the team in both goals and assists. Kim's older brother, Per Rontved, the former Danish national team captain, joined the Wings as well. Andy Chapman led the team in scoring with 48 goals. At 27-21 by season's end, the Wings finished second in their division, just ahead of the Steamers. They would face St. Louis again in the playoffs, this time in the quarterfinals. The Wings would finally break the curse. In game three, at the Kansas Coliseum, the Wings would triumph in a game with a variety of unusual events: Kim Røntved scored on an almost unbelievable header from beyond 100 feet; Per Rontved made a 125-foot shorthanded shot; and Steamer defender Steve Pecher scuffled with a Wings fan while in the penalty box, resulting in his ejection from the game.\n\nSt. Louis would get revenge at the end of the 1983-84 season, sweeping the Wings in the semifinals. That year's squad featured a new arrival from Scotland: Ian Anderson. He would lead the team in blocks. Andy Chapman finished second in scoring in the MISL, with 53 goals. Kim Røntved was named the league's Defender of the Year. The team's finances were bolstered by excellent attendance at 9,391 per game. The 1984-85 season was a disappointing one for the team. The Wings would end with a losing record of 21-26 and lose in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. However, they added two players that would have a long-term impact. Terry Rowe was a talented defender from London, England. Danish sensation Erik Rasmussen earned his nickname, \"The Wizard,\" due to his dynamic abilities on the ball. He would become a record-setting player during his career with the Wings. In 1988, he earned the team's only MISL MVP award.\n\nThe 1985-86 season brought a change in goal. The departure of Mike Dowler to the Tacoma Stars resulted in a pair of new goalkeepers joining the Wings. Jan Oleson from Denmark and Seamus McDonagh from Ireland would split goalkeeping duties. Olesen would be remembered for scoring a goal in a game against the St. Louis Steamers. He dribbled the ball from his own goal to the other end of the field, kicking the ball between Slobo Ilijevski's legs. Englishman Barry Wallace, Scotsman Dave Hoggan, and Californian Mike Fox joined the team that season. Each would have an important impact. But no one had an impact like \"The American Dream,\" Chico Borja. The former Las Vegas American became a Wings player thanks to the dissolution of the Vegas franchise. Borja would become a star from the midfield position, becoming the all-time Wings assist leader by the end of his career. Despite a 27-21 season, the Wings would lose in the first round of the playoffs to the Tacoma Stars.\n\nBig changes came to the front office and coaching staff in 1986. Francis Dale stepped down as commissioner of the MISL and the Wings' own Bill Kentling took his place. When Kentling went to the new league headquarters in New York City, it was decided that Roy Turner was the logical choice to replace him. Turner stepped down as head coach and was named President of the Wings. The changes continued when Frank Carney decided to step down as managing general partner. William \"Bill\" Oliver Jr. took his place at the top of the Wings' power structure. Replacing Turner as coach was an important and difficult task. The team convinced Scottish legend Charlie Cooke, the \"Bonnie Prince,\" to fill Turner's shoes. Cooke instituted an up-tempo style that emphasized defensive pressure. It wasn't always popular with the older veterans. In 1986-87, the Wings added the young forward Mark Kerlin from Arizona and the Welsh superstar Mickey Thomas of Chelsea and Manchester United fame. A rookie from California named Dale Ervine would have the biggest long-term impact. At the end of his eight years in Wichita, \"The Bruin\" would be second on the all-time goals scored list. The Wings would lose in the division semifinals to Tacoma in 1987 after finishing the season with a 27-25 record.\n\nIn 1987-88, the Wings brought in Nenad \"Ziggy\" Zigante to replace Seamus McDonagh in goal. Former US Olympian Jean Willrich and longtime indoor pro Mike Stankovic also joined the squad in Charlie Cooke's second year. But it was a season that Cooke himself would not finish. On January 30, 1988, Cooke and assistant coach Norman Piper were fired after starting the year 11-16. Former Wing Terry Nicholl would take over as head coach, with Kevin Kewley adding \"assistant coach\" to his duties on the field. Though the Wings would have their worst ever season, finishing 23-33, two Wings would end up leading the MISL. Erik Rasmussen became the scoring champion and league MVP, while Zigante was named the league's Newcomer of the Year.\n\nThe MISL would last until the end of the 1991-92 season, but Terry Nicholl's tenure as coach lasted only until February 1991. After a poor start to the season, he was replaced by original Wings' coach Roy Turner. The Wings would fail to achieve a winning record during those final years of the MISL. However, the team would add several players that had positive, multi-year impacts on the team, including defender Tommy Soehn, midfielder Perry Van der Beck, former Derby County and Northern Ireland national team player Victor Moreland, Yugoslav midfielder Goran Hunjak, goalkeeper Kris Peat, Baltimore Blast striker David Byrne.\n\nIn 1992, after several years of struggling to keep franchises, the MISL folded. The Wings, under a new ownership group led by local businessman Mike Relihan, joined the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL). The player salaries were smaller and it lacked some of the large cities that the MISL was proud to include, but it provided the Wings a league in which to play. In 1996, Roy Turner left the team. He would be remembered as the man most associated with the Wichita Wings since their inception in 1979. Though the Wings would have some success on the field during the NPSL years, their home attendance would never equal that of the 1980s. In 1998, Randy and Shirley Johnson would take over as owners of the Wings. When the team folded in 2001, it would be the longest-running soccer franchise in the United States.\n\nThe Wings would appear nationally on the USA Network, ESPN, and CBS. Their first local television contract was with KSN-TV (NBC) and announcer Dave Armstrong in 1981-82. KSN would continue to broadcast the Wings through the 1985-86 season. Other announcers included Craig Bolerjack, Mike Kennedy, and Steve Dennis. Former Wing Joe Howarth and Director of Media Relations Steve Shaad, respectively, would serve as the color commentator for several of those seasons. The 1986-87 season saw KAKE-TV (ABC) take over the broadcast. Mark Allan would be their announcer through the 1988-89 season. The Wings would have no television contract thereafter.\n\nKFH Radio (1330 AM) would broadcast the Wings from 1981 through 1986, with first Bruce Haertl and then Jim Hawley announcing. Steve Shaad, Blake Schreck, and Klaus Kollmai served as color commentators on the KFH broadcasts. In 1986, KRZ (1240 AM) took over the radio broadcasting, with Dave Phillips as announcer. As KNSS, they would continue to broadcast the Wings through the 1989-90 season. Phillips would be the voice of the Wings with KZSN (1480 AM) through the 1993 season. Steve Dennis took over KZSN's announcing duties in 1994 and continued through the transition to KFH in 1995-96. Former Wings goalkeeper Kris Peat served as announcer in 1996-97. In 1997, Rob Barzegar and KQAM (1480 AM) became the Wings radio broadcaster.\n\nThe Kansas Coliseum (Britt Brown Arena)\n\nDuring home games in the mid-late 1980s, the Wings used the \"Gonna Fly Now\" theme from the movie \"Rocky\" to celebrate Wings' goals. For some time this music was also used for player introductions.\n"}

It was located north of Wichita at the intersection of I-135 and 85th Street North.\n\nIt hosted sporting events, concerts, shows, and consisted of four pavilions, an RV park, and the 9,686-seat Britt Brown Arena, named for Harry Britton (Britt) Brown Jr., of Wichita, the former owner of \"The Wichita Eagle\" newspaper. Arena capacity could be configured for up to 12,200 people.\n\nKansas Coliseum was opened in 1977. Two brass plaques (one located on the lower level, by the box office windows and the other up on the main concourse) read:\n\n\"Dedicated September 1978, for the promotion of agricultural, educational, and cultural benefits, on behalf of the people of the world, by the citizens of Sedgwick County, the board of the county commissioners, the Kansas State Park and Resources Authority, the Economic Development Administration and the Ozark Regional Commission of the United States Department of Commerce and the Kansas Coliseum Corporation.\"\n\nIt hosted NCAA Men's Basketball tournament first and second-round games in 1981 and 1994. The Wichita State University basketball teams played the 2002-03 season there while the Shockers' on-campus home, Charles Koch Arena, was undergoing major renovations.\n\nIt was the home of the now-defunct Wichita Wings indoor soccer team, who played in the MISL and NPSL between 1979 and 2001. The Kansas Coliseum was the home venue for the Wichita Stealth, Wichita Aviators, and Wichita Wild indoor/arena football teams between 2001–2008. It also was home to the Wichita Thunder ice hockey team that played in the Coliseum from 1992 to 2009. The Wichita Thunder now plays in the INTRUST Bank Arena in downtown Wichita, Kansas.\n\nThe last Wichita Thunder hockey game ever played at the Kansas Coliseum was on January 9, 2010 in front of a home crowd of 5,556. The Thunder lost the game 3–1 to the Odessa Jackalopes. Brent Ottmann would be the last Thunder player to score a goal in the building at 2:05 of the 1st period, and Kenny Bernard of Odessa scoring the last goal ever at 19:53 of the 3rd period.\n\nThe final event to take place inside the Arena was the RV and Boat show on February 20, 2010. On February 22, 2010, The Britt Brown Arena closed its doors. The arena ceased hosting events, while the neighboring Kansas Pavilions portion of the complex remained open until late 2016.\n\nOn January 10, 2012 the entire Coliseum complex was sold by Sedgwick County to aviation research developer Johnny Stevens for a sum of $1,462,487.12. The Britt Brown Arena was transformed into an aerospace testing facility for the National Institute for Aviation Research.\n\n\n"}

For example, Jena joined the Metropolitan Region in 2009. The registered association owns the management company Metropolregion Mitteldeutschland Management GmbH. As such it forms a planning and marketing framework for the region while retaining the legal independence of its members.\n\nIn 1997 the German Ministerial Conference for Regional Development declared the 'Saxon Triangle' (Dresden, Leipzig/Halle, and Chemnitz) as the seventh of 11 metropolitan regions in German.\n\nOut of this initial conference the Initiativkreis Europäische Metropolregionen in Deutschland IKM (Initiative Group for European Metropolitan Regions in Germany) was formed in 2001 which developed the concept of the Central German Metropolitan Region in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Dresden and Magdeburg dropped out of the club and the membership has been focused more on cities and towns around Leipzig and Halle.\n\nThe largest of the eight member cities are Leipzig in Saxony and Halle (Saale) in Saxony-Anhalt.\n\nThe member cities have changed over time and the current member cities are as follows:\nExcept for Zwickau and Wittenberg, all towns hold the status of an independent city (i.e. a county-free city).

Other urban areas, such as Dessau-Roslau are however still declining.\n\nThe region represented by the Europäische Metropolregion Mitteldeutschland e.V contains important trade corridors in central Europe, including the routes of several highways of the International E-road network as well as two major German expressways (A9 Munich-Berlin and A14 Dresden-Wismar). Leipzig-Halle is a major railway hub along the Berlin–Palermo railway axis which is part of the Trans-European high-speed rail network. Other railway mainlines connect it with Dresden, Frankfurt, Frankfurt Airport and Prague. Leipzig-Halle airport serves as the main airport of the region. It is the second largest freight airport in Germany and a hub of DHL express service.\n\nThe metropolitan region association has set up a working group on traffic and mobility, the members of which are delegated from various regional stakeholders, i.e. state ministries, cities, counties and public transport associations.\n\n"}

His mother was Consort Rong (榮妃; d. 28 March 1727) from the Magiya clan and was the daughter of Gaishan (蓋山), who served as an Imperial Examination Examiner (員外郎). Yinzhi was granted the title of \"Prince Cheng of the Second Rank\" (誠郡王) in 1698.\n\nYinzhi was known to be studious as a child and was versed in literary arts. His talents earned him the appreciation of his father. French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet once mentioned in a letter to King Louis XIV that the Kangxi Emperor personally taught Yinzhi geometry. When the Kangxi Emperor opened a school in Changchun Gardens (暢春園), he placed Yinzhi in charge of compiling a book titled \"Lü Li Yuan Yuan\" (律歷淵源), which included the \"shi-er-lü\", calendrical calculations, and mathematics. Yinzhi was also known for his skill in calligraphy, and was tasked with writing the inscriptions on the memorial tablet at the Kangxi Emperor's tomb in Jingling Mausoleum, Eastern Qing Tombs.\n\nYinzhi showed little interest in the conflict among his brothers for succession to the throne. He did not take any sides in the contention and preferred to spend time compiling and writing books. In 1706 the encyclopedia \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" was completed by Chen Menglei (陳夢雷), a scholar and associate of Yinzhi.\n\nIn 1722 the Kangxi Emperor died and was succeeded by his fourth son Yinzhen, who became known as the Yongzheng Emperor. Yinzhi changed his name to \"Yunzhi\" to avoid naming taboo because the Chinese character for \"Yin\" (胤) in \"Yinzhi\" is the same as the one in the Yongzheng Emperor's personal name \"Yinzhen\" (胤禛). After his ascension to the throne, the Yongzheng Emperor ordered Yunzhi to remain at the Jingling Mausoleum to watch over their father's tomb on an excuse that \"Yinzhi was closely affiliated to the crown prince (Yinreng)\". Yunzhi was unhappy with this arrangement and complained behind the Yongzheng Emperor's back. When Yinxiang, one of Yongzheng's closest half brothers, died in 1730, Yunzhi expressed little grief and sorrow. Yongzheng was angry when he heard of Yunzhi's reaction, so he stripped Yunzhi of his title and had him confined in the Yong'an Pavilion, Jingshan, Beijing.

It was originally released in Japan on July 15 at the Toei Anime Fair. It was later dubbed into English by Funimation in 2006, just like most of the other \"Dragon Ball\" films. It was also released on VCD in Malaysia by Speedy Video with the subtitle Explosion of Dragon Punch.\n\nSet after the events of the final battle with Kid Buu, the film focuses on the efforts of an evil magician, Hoi, to release the deadly monster Hirudegarn onto the Earth, forcing Goku and his friends to enlist the aid of a warrior named Tapion, who may be the only one capable of defeating the monster. Series creator Akira Toriyama designed the Tapion and Minotia characters.\n\nOn a distant planet, a young alien boy frantically searches his surroundings, sword at the ready. Before he can even react, he is crushed to death by the foot of a gigantic creature (which only appears to have a lower-half). The creature disappears and an unseen person laughs and announces that his next stop is Earth.\n\nOn Earth, Gohan and Videl (as the Great Saiyaman and Great Saiyaman 2, respectively) are summoned to the city to stop an old, alien-like man from committing suicide by jumping off a tower. Once they rescue him and take him elsewhere, the man introduces himself as Hoi and presents them with a music box, inside which he claims a hero named Tapion is trapped, and may be the Earth's last chance against an approaching evil. When even Goku fails to open the music box, the Z-Fighters gather the Dragon Balls and ask Shenron to open it for them. Tapion is released, but expresses anger at Hoi and Goku for freeing him, explaining that inside him is the essence of half of the ferocious monster, Hirudegarn, before fleeing into isolation. Trunks, however, takes an immediate liking to Tapion, and frequently sneaks off to his location to bring him food, despite Tapion angrily telling him to leave him alone.\n\nShortly afterwards, the lower half of Hirudegarn appears and begins attacking the city. Gohan and Videl rush to the city's aid, but are unable to deal any damage until Tapion appears, playing a mysterious tune on an ocarina which weakens Hirudegarn and causes him to vanish. Later on, however, while Trunks is bringing Tapion some food, Hoi suddenly appears and tries to steal Tapion's ocarina. Hoi claims that Tapion himself is the evil threat to the Earth and that the ocarina must be destroyed for them to stop Tapion. In the ensuing scuffle, Trunks grabs the ocarina, but chooses to believe Tapion and returns it to him, while Hoi flees. Tapion accepts Trunks as a friend and is invited to the Capsule Corporation compound. While there, he explains his story to Bulma: a thousand years ago, an evil race of alien magicians, the Kashvaar, proclaimed themselves as the superior race and set out to destroy all life different from their own in the universe by awakening an ancient monster known as Hirudegarn. Their conquest eventually brought them to the planet Konats, Tapion's homeworld. During the ensuing battle, a Konatsian priest discovered a magic sword and two ocarinas capable of stopping Hirudegarn. Tapion and his younger brother Minotia kept Hirudegarn at bay with the ocarinas while the priest cleaved the monster in half with the sword. In the aftermath, in order to ensure Hirudegarn would never again be released, the Konatsian War Council decided to seal Hirudegarn's two halves away inside Tapion and Minotia, magically seal them inside music boxes and send them to opposite ends of the universe until the Kashvaar were brought to justice. Hoi, who is the last surviving Kashvaar, has already killed Minotia (as seen in the prologue), and now seeks out Tapion in order to complete Hirudegarn's revival and conquer the universe. Bulma offers to build Tapion a bedroom using the components of the music box so that Tapion can sleep without Hirudegarn escaping from him.\n\nHowever, while sleeping, a nightmare causes Tapion to accidentally destroy the bedroom. Hirudegarn's lower half reappears and starts attacking. In desperation, Tapion begs Goku and the others to kill him in order to destroy Hirudegarn's upper half, but it is too late and the monster's revival is completed. A fierce battle between the Z-Fighters and Hirudegarn ensues, with none of the fighters being able to keep up with the monster's strength and speed. Vegeta shows up to help Goku and the Z-Fighters, but is ultimately knocked out by Hirudegarn. Trunks and Goten fuse into Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks and bombard Hirudegarn with energy blasts, apparently burning him to death, but Hirudegarn transforms into a much faster and powerful form and makes quick work of Gotenks (defusing him in the process) and the rest of the Z-Fighters. Tapion appears and seals Hirudegarn inside himself again by playing the ocarina, and asks Trunks to slay him and destroy Hirudegarn forever. Trunks hesitates, and Hirudegarn escapes again, destroying the ocarina. As Hoi watches and gloats over his apparent victory, in an ironic twist, he is stepped on and crushed to death (the same way Minotia was killed) by the monster he believed would destroy all life different than his own. By now, the only fighter left standing is Goku, who refuses to surrender. In desperation, Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan 3 and starts taunting Hirudegarn, angering the monster further (earlier, Gohan learnt that intense emotions drain Hirudegarn's energy). As Goku and Hirudegarn battle, Trunks intervenes and cuts Hirudegarn's tail off with Tapion's sword. Goku angers the monster up to a point his defensive armor is useless. With Hirudegarn temporarily weakened, Goku uses his Dragon Fist attack to pierce through the monster, obliterating Hirudegarn and ending his terror once and for all.\n\nIn the aftermath, Tapion uses Bulma's time machine to return to Konats, while Bulma promises to revive all of Hirudegarn's victims with the Dragon Balls. Before leaving, Tapion presents Trunks with his sword as a farewell gift. In the ending credits, Future Trunks is shown slaying Frieza, King Cold and their men with a sword similar to the one Tapion gave him.\n\n is the hero who fought Hirudegarn. He was from a planet called Konats and is famed for being a \"legendary warrior\" there. Thousands of years ago, Tapion and his younger brother Minotia were ordinary Konatsians, living on the peaceful planet of Konats. However, one day, a group of black magicians known as the Kashvaar performed an ancient ritual that revived the ruthless and enormous monster Hirudegarn. With no sense of reason, Hirudegarn used his incredible power to lay waste to Konats. During the battle between Hirudegarn and the Konatsians, Tapion and Minotia used their special ocarinas to hold Hirudegarn at bay. Given this opportunity, a wizard brandished an enchanted sword and used it to slice Hirudegarn in half. Tapion, Minotia and the wizard were then known as great heroes among the Konatsians. To ensure Hirudegarn's eternal imprisonment, Tapion and Minotia agreed to have their bodies guard each half of Hirudegarn (his top half went to Tapion and his bottom half to Minotia). They were then enclosed in mystical music boxes and dispatched to opposite ends of the universe. Minotia was sent to an unknown planet, while Tapion was sent to Earth. Unfortunately, a Kashvaar named Hoi would go off in search for Tapion and Minotia's music boxes in order to free them and unleash Hirudegarn once again. Hoi plotted to use Hirudegarn's destructive powers to take over the universe. With the help of the Z-Fighters (Goku, Gohan, Goten, Videl, and Trunks) and Shenron, Hoi managed to free Tapion from the music box (Hoi had not revealed his true intentions to the Z-Fighters). A furious Tapion stormed off, determined to stay alone in order to ensure the imprisonment of Hirudegarn's top half. He was visited regularly by Trunks, who had taken a liking to him and brought him food, but Tapion refused to eat and always shunned Trunks away. Later on, while Trunks was visiting Tapion, Hoi attempted to steal the ocarina from Tapion and tell Trunks that Tapion was the true monster, but Trunks didn't believe him and instead gave the flute back to Tapion. Tapion then befriends Trunks, and asked him to hang out with him. Tapion and Trunks then formed a friendship, and Tapion was eventually invited to stay at Capsule Corporation. Tapion explained his whole backstory to Bulma, and she announced that she would try to recreate the broken music box so that Tapion could finally rest, much to Tapion's delight. After Hirudegarn was let loose and revived, Tapion gave Trunks his sword and asked Trunks to kill him in order to kill Hirudegarn. As Trunks was about to kill Tapion, Hirudegarn awakened one last time, ultimately being destroyed by Super Saiyan 3 Goku. After his fight was over, Tapion used a Time Machine (similar to the one used by Future Trunks) to travel back to Konats. As a gift, Tapion gave his sword to Trunks and went one thousand years back in time to his home, never to be seen or mentioned again.\n\n is an enormous monster, and the main antagonist of \"Wrath of the Dragon\". He is a simple-minded monster that destroys everything and kills anyone in his path. The ancient and gigantic monster Hirudegarn existed thousands of years prior to the events of the series, on an Earth-like planet in the Southern Galaxy named Konats. He started the Hirudegarn War, killing many Konats, but was turned to stone after hearing the notes of an ocarina. Since Hirudegarn couldn't be killed at the time, his upper half was sealed inside Tapion and the other half inside Minotia. However, fearing that the Kashvaar would try to revive the monster again someday, the brothers were separated, each sealed in a music box by the wizard, and were then sent to opposite ends of the universe, far away from each other, by the Konats war council, with the music box holding Tapion landing on Earth. The wizard vowed to release the brothers once the Kashvaar were brought to justice, and it is assumed that the Kashvaar were hunted down over time. A thousand years later in the present, the last of the Kashvaar, Hoi, had vowed to resurrect the monster to cleanse the universe of all who were not Kashvaars. He released Hirudegarn's lower half on a distant planet and easily disposed of Minotia, who was crushed under the foot of the monster. Upon Minotia's death, Hoi sealed the lower half inside himself to summon at his own leisure. On Earth, however, he switched to a more tactical plan and spied on Gohan (as the Great Saiyaman) and Videl (as the Great Saiyawoman) as they fought crime. Both were summoned from their school again to rescue Hoi, who was pretending to be suicidal to gain their trust and sympathy. Hoi then told the two about the legendary warrior, Tapion. Hirudegarn wreaks havoc in Satan City after he is fully revived by Hoi, but he is killed by Goku's Dragon Fist after the latter transforms into a Super Saiyan 3.\n\nHoi searched far and wide to find the enchanted music boxes that contained Tapion and Minotia. The evil mage manages to find Minotia on a distant planet and frees him, after which Hirudegarn's lower half materializes and kills the boy by crushing him under one of its feet. Off in the distance, Hoi's maniacal laugh can be heard during Minotia's death. After his arrival on Earth, Hoi tries to jump off a building while knowing that Gohan and Videl (as the Great Saiyaman and Great Saiyawoman, respectively) would come to his rescue. He then proceeds to tell them about Tapion as well as a \"\"crisis that threatens Earth\"\", the \"crisis\" caused by an \"evil\" that \"\"will ravage earth [...] consuming all\"\" (Hirudegarn). With this information, he was able to trick the Z-Fighters into helping him release Tapion (and thus Hirudegarn's top half). After failed attempts by Bulma's technical expertise and Goku's sheer strength, the Z-Fighters locate the Dragon Balls, and they use them at Capsule Corporation to summon Shenron and release Tapion from his confinement. Even after Tapion is released (showing the truth behind his claims of Tapion's existence), both Gohan and Videl (Videl in particular, who never trusted Hoi to begin with) feel that Hoi is still hiding something from them.\n\nThat night, Hoi unleashes the bottom half of Hirudegarn on Satan City (even while not being the whole monster, it was causing massive devastation), with armed forces and eventually Gohan and Videl attempting to stop its devastating rampage. However, Gohan and Videl are only able to cause minor damage to the lower half of Hirudegarn and it is only through Tapion that the monster's lower half is forced to retreat. Gohan and Videl do catch a glimpse of Hoi as he heads to Tapion's location.\n\nLater, while Trunks was visiting Tapion, Hoi attempts to steal the ocarina (to destroy it and prevent Tapion from keeping Hirudegarn sealed away) and tells Trunks that Tapion is the true monster, but Trunks does not believe him and instead gives the ocarina back to Tapion. Later that night, Tapion tells Bulma about Hoi's history: about being a member of the Kashvaar, their belief in their supremacy in the universe, their systematic attempts to exterminate all races different from their own (believing them to be inferior and unworthy) and their attempted genocide of the people of Konats (Tapion saying that Hoi, along with the other Kashvaar, was responsible for the slaughter of half of his entire race, using Hirudegarn as a weapon of mass destruction). After Hirudegarn was defeated by being horizontally cleaved in two, the two halves were confined inside the two brothers, who were further placed within a pair of music boxes which were then sealed and sent to the opposite ends of the universe. Bulma expresses anger at Hoi's actions, including his involvement in the murder of Minotia. Tapion explains that, as long as he stays awake, Hoi cannot free the upper half of Hirudegarn (which is why he had little-to-no sleep between being freed until this point in time). Bulma tells Tapion that she will build him a chamber that functions the same as the music box, to allow him to sleep while also keeping Hirudegarn's top half contained, preventing Hoi from assembling the complete monster (only asking in return that he spend time with Trunks, something Tapion is happy to do, having grown fond of the boy). The next night, Hoi unleashes Hirudegarn's lower half on West City once again. This time, the evil wizard allows Hirudegarn to consume humans around the city by absorbing them through his tail. He expresses his contempt for humanity and his intention to bring the universe under his control. He later attempts to free the upper half, but Tapion is able to keep it from escaping. Hoi then brings the lower half to Tapion's location. As Tapion explains, the closer the two halves are to each other, the more powerful each becomes and the stronger the attraction between them (the harder the effort to prevent them from rejoining at close proximity).\n\nAfter finally reviving Hirudegarn, Hoi orders the monster to extinguish all human life on Earth. It is at this point that he reveals that he is the last Kashvaar alive. When Tapion plays his ocarina to weaken Hirudegarn, Hoi mocks his efforts and claims that it will not save him any more than it did Minotia, revealing that Minotia is indeed dead by his hand.\n\nAfter the efforts of Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta, Ultimate Gohan, Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks and Super Saiyan 2 Goku seem to be unable to destroy Hirudegarn and put an end to its ruinous rampage, Hoi begins laughing madly, commanding Hirudegarn to continue destroying the inhabitants of Earth. However, Tapion makes a last-ditch effort to stop the monster and begins playing his ocarina to weaken it. Hoi scolds Tapion, but becomes shocked when not only is Hirudegarn unable to harm Tapion, but is weakened enough to be temporarily sealed within Tapion in entirety. Tapion then asks Trunks to strike his heart with his sword, willing to sacrifice his own life to ensure Hirudegarn's demise. When Trunks seems as though he is going to carry out Tapion's final request, Hoi leaps into action to prevent this. However, Trunks' distress at the prospect of having to kill a friend causes him to hesitate long enough to allow Hirudegarn to escape. Hoi arrogantly states that he is solely entitled to control Hirudegarn along with all \"inferior creatures\" that \"pollute\" the universe which belongs to him. He then orders Hirudegarn to \"\"massacre them all!\"\". Unfortunately for him, Hoi is killed by Hirudegarn when the monster inadvertently crushes him under his foot, thus killing the last of the Kashvaars. Hirudegarn is slain by Super Saiyan 3 Goku shortly afterwards, bringing a permanent end to the threat that Hoi and his race started in the first place.\n\nA second English dub produced and released exclusively in Malaysia by Speedy Video features an unknown voice cast.\n\n\nThe score for the English language version by Funimation was composed by Nathan M. Johnson. He learned to play the ocarina for Tapion's theme. The remastered release contains an alternate audio track containing the English dialogue and Japanese background music by Shunsuke Kikuchi.\n\nIt was released on DVD in North America on September 12, 2006, It was later digitally remastered and released in a final Double Feature set with \"\" on Blu-ray and DVD on May 19, 2009. The film was re-released to DVD on January 3, 2012 in a remastered box set containing the final four \"Dragon Ball Z\" movies.\n\n"}

Occurring three and a half decades after the Battle of Chengpu, where Jin decisively defeated Chu, the battle was a major victory for Chu, cementing the position of its ruler King Zhuang as a hegemon among the states of the Zhou Dynasty.\n\nThe states of Jin and Chu were both among the most powerful of their time, but while Jin was considered a legitimate Zhou state in terms of culture and lineage, the state of Chu - whose territory encompassed many non-Chinese cultures in the middle Yangtze River - was considered a half-civilised state at best.\n\nJin-Chu rivalry last came to a head with the decisive defeat of Chu at the Battle of Chengpu, where Duke Wen of Jin became hegemon among the states; after the death of Duke Wen, Chu attempted to reassert its position with northern campaigns, but the presence of Zhao Dun as premier of Jin rendered them unwilling to risk direct conflict.\n\nThis situation would change dramatically with the death of Zhao Dun in 601 BC, as well as the death of Duke Cheng of Jin the following year, followed by that of Zhao's successor Xi Que () in 598 BC. King Zhuang made use of the resulting instability among the Jin leadership, and personally led a campaign northward.\n\nKing Zhuang targeted the state of Zheng, which was an ally of Jin, and successfully forced Zheng to switch allegiance to Chu. Meanwhile, Xun Linfu, the new commander of the Jin armies, led his forces to relieve Zheng, only to learn of the surrender of Zheng en route, while camped along the northern bank of the Yellow River. This created a rift among the Jin commanders, about whether to meet the Chu forces in battle.\n\nAt the same time, Chu's armies retreated by 30 \"li\" and decamped, awaiting the Jin offensive.\n\nXun Linfu, after hearing of Zheng's switch of allegiance, was in favour of retreating; however, his adjutant Xian Hu, maintaining that it would be cowardly to avoid battle as the hegemonic state, led his own troops across the Yellow River without instructions. This forced the rest of the army to follow suit.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Chu side, King Zhuang was intimidated by the presence of the Jin army; even his commander Sunshu Ao was initially in favour of retreat. Wu Can, a Chu commander, advised against this, citing the inexperience of Xun Linfu as the supreme commander, the rashness of Xian Hu as adjutant, and the conflict between the Jin commanders. King Zhuang thus resolved to face down the Jin army, even though negotiations for a truce continued between the two armies.\n\nThe battle began only when two generals from the Jin army, dissatisfied at Xun Linfu's hesitation, decided to provoke the Chu forces. King Zhuang personally pursued the generals; Xun Linfu sent a force to escort the two generals back to Jin lines, but the rolling dust from this relief force was mistaken as a general advance by the Jin army. Fearing that the king could be cut off by the army, Sunshu Ao immediately ordered a general advance from the Chu army; this unexpected attack overwhelmed Jin forces, which then collapsed and were routed.\n\nKing Zhuang, upon winning the battle, led his generals to water their horses from the Yellow River; a request to pursue and destroy the remnant forces was rebuffed on the grounds that, with the humiliation of Chengpu avenged, there was no need for more slaughter.\n"}

He was the nephew of Major General George G. Meade.\n\nMeade was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Richard Worsam Meade II, an officer in the United States Navy. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on 14 June 1862, and commanded a battalion of marines during the suppression of the New York City draft riots in July 1863. He took part in the daring boat attack against Fort Sumter on 8 September 1863, and was later brevetted for gallant and meritorious service. During the raid, he was captured by Confederate soldiers defending the fort, and he spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner of the Confederacy.\n\nBetween the Civil War and the Spanish–American War, Meade served in a variety of billets at shore and aboard ship. In the early 1870s, he commanded the Marine detachment aboard the first U.S. warship to visit Cochin-China (now Vietnam) with the mission of deterring pirates from attacking American shipping in the area. He also served as Commanding Officer of the Marine Barracks at the New York Navy Yard and the Boston Navy Yard. While at the Boston Navy Yard, Lieutenant Colonel Meade made an enemy of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, by refusing to award a construction contract to a firm recommended by Roosevelt.\n\nDuring the Spanish–American War he served as fleet Marine officer on the cruiser USS \"New York\" and participated in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Victor Maria Concas y Palau, captain of the cruiser at the battle of Santiago, described the poor attitude of Meade to the Spanish prisoners at Portsmouth. He claimed that Meade's attitude was responsible of the death of several sailors, as he did not allow them to have the adequate medical help, and that he also had a lack of respect for Spanish officers.\n\nImmediately after the Spanish–American War, Meade was sent to the Philippines as part of a Marine detachment intended to counter the rising tensions between Filipino Muslim rebels and the government. Shortly after arriving in the Philippines, he was promoted to colonel on 3 March 1899, and was sent to China during the Boxer Rebellion. He was the senior American officer during the events leading up to the Battle of Tientsin, but he was medically evacuated before the actual battle occurred. For distinguished conduct and public service, he was appointed brigadier general, by brevet, on July 13, 1900.\n\nWhen Major General Charles Heywood retired as Commandant of the Marine Corps in 1903, Brigadier General Meade was the longest serving Marine officer then on active duty, and he believed he was next in line to be General Heywood's replacement. President Theodore Roosevelt, undoubtedly remembering the insubordination of Major Meade in the affair involving a construction contract at the Boston Navy Yard, instead appointed Major General George F. Elliott to be the new Commandant. Robert Leamy Meade retired from the Marine Corps on June 29, 1906 after 43 years of service and having taken part in every major military action that took place from the Civil War through the Boxer Rebellion.\n\nHe was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and the Military Order of Foreign Wars.\n\nGeneral Meade died at Lexington, Massachusetts, on February 11, 1910. He is buried in Huntington Rural Cemetery in Huntington, New York.\n\n\nGeneral Meade would have been awarded the Brevet Medal except that he died before the Brevet Medal's establishment in 1921.\n\nTwo ships have been named for him and his brother, Richard Worsam Meade III. The sons of Richard Worsam Meade II, they were nephews of General George Gordon Meade.\n"}

The Hitlers lived in the building only until Adolf was three years old, when his father was transferred to Passau. \n\nAfter World War II, the building was rented by the Austrian Republic in 1952 and obtained heritage protection as part of the historic city centre. Until 1965, it was the home of the public library and later a bank. From 1970 to 1976, several classes from the technical high school were held in the house, until the school was rebuilt. The house then for many years accommodated a branch of the charity \"Lebenshilfe\", and operated as a day centre and workshops for people with learning difficulties. After the charity left the building in 2011, it remained empty. As of 2016, the Austrian government intends to expropriate the owner and to demolish the building. A special expropriation law was adopted.\n\nSuggestions regarding making Hitler's birthplace a place of remembrance for the victims of Nazism had already been made in the early years after the war. For a long time, the council discussed putting up a memorial tablet on the house, and in 1983 the decision was made by the then mayor Hermann Fuchs, with intervention from Culture Advisor Wolfgang Simböck. However, the memorial tablet was not attached, because the owner (who had no connection to Hitler) felt that it would be an intrusion on her rights of ownership. She successfully opposed it in court because of her fear of unwelcome attention or attacks from anti- or Neonazis.\n\nIn 1989, the new mayor, Gerhard Skiba, took the initiative. In April 1989, (two weeks before the centenary of Hitler's birth) a memorial was placed directly in front of the house on public ground. The stone for the memorial came from a quarry on the grounds of the former Mauthausen Concentration Camp, near Linz, Austria. The inscription on the memorial reads:\n\nThe official name of the memorial is the \"Memorial Stone Against War and Fascism\". It appears as the \"Mahnstein\" \"(\"Remembrance Stone\")\" on street maps.\n\n\n"}

It consists of a musical setting of the mass sung in Latin and Greek and arranged in the psychedelic style of the band, and was written and arranged by David Axelrod.\n\nFollowing the limited commercial success of the Electric Prunes' previous album, \"Underground\", the band's manager Lenny Poncher and their producer Dave Hassinger, whose company owned the rights to the band name, agreed with Reprise Records that their third album would be written and arranged by David Axelrod, a classically trained musician. The album was planned to combine religious and classical elements with psychedelic rock, in a religious-based rock-opera concept album. Axelrod was given carte blanche by Hassinger to do what he wanted with the Electric Prunes. \n\nWhen the existing band – singer James Lowe, guitarists Ken Williams and Mike Gannon, bassist Mark Tulin, and drummer Michael \"Quint\" Weakley – came to record the album, it became apparent that the complex arrangements largely outstripped the band's ability to perform them to the standards expected by Axelrod, or within the time set aside for recording. Although Lowe, Tulin (the only band member who could read music) and Weakley appeared on all the tracks, and Williams and Gannon also appeared on the first three tracks (\"Kyrie Eleison\", \"Gloria\" and \"Credo\"), the album was finished by studio musicians working with engineer Richie Podolor on guitar, and a Canadian group, the Collectors. The choral-style vocals were by Lowe, double-tracked. Hassinger was credited with producing the album.\n\n\"Mass in F Minor\" was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. Photos of the band appeared on the back of the record sleeve, though with the band's previous guitarist James 'Weasel' Spagnola shown, rather than Gannon. The Electric Prunes performed the album's songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, all in the same key. I made my way over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal. Mercifully, this all ended and as we were leaving a few 'fans' said, 'We didn't know you guys were into avant-garde jazz.' \n\nAn eerie version of the opening track, \"Kyrie Eleison\", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, \"Easy Rider\". \n\nSome later reissues of \"Mass in F Minor\" incorrectly credited a later incarnation of the band with recording the album. The Electric Prunes were credited with a further album arranged by David Axelrod, \"Release of an Oath\", arranged in a similar style to \"Mass in F Minor\", but by that time the original band had dissolved.\n\nAll songs composed by David Axelrod except where noted.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Later, the colleges in Dammam have been segregated to become the University of Dammam.\n\nThe university was founded in 1975 by the Royal Decree No. H / 67 1395 e in the eastern region of the country. In its first year, it leased buildings, and in subsequent years it used some prefabricated buildings for the colleges.\n\nThe first four scientific colleges were: The College of Agricultural and Food Sciences and the College of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry at the main campus in Al Ahsa; and the College of Architecture and Planning and the College of Medicine and Medical Sciences in Dammam. In later years, with the intent to meet the future needs of the Kingdom, with the issuance of Royal decree No. 7 / b / 11155, and with the consent of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the Chairman of the Board of Higher Education, the College of Education was founded in 1981, and the Faculty of Administrative Sciences and Planning in 1984.

Fen Huang, a Jin officer, pointed out that the best Chu troops in the center were bogged down by the marsh, leaving the flanks to be held only by badly disciplined 'wild tribes of the south'. Jin chariots then charged both Chu flanks, scattering the enemy. They then proceeded to attack the center, which contained the Chu King commanding his troops.

He appeared on \"The Ricky Gervais Show\", presented the Sky travel comedy series \"An Idiot Abroad\", and made his full acting debut (following a cameo appearance in the final episode of \"Extras\") on Gervais's 2012 comedy–drama series \"Derek\". Pilkington is a co-founder, along with Gervais and Merchant, of RiSK Productions, a television production company. Pilkington also starred in the Sky 1 travel documentary comedy series \"The Moaning of Life\" (2013–2015). In 2018, Pilkington starred in a new scripted comedy series, \"Sick of It.\"\n\nPilkington was born in 1972 in Manchester. He grew up on a Manchester council estate along with his siblings, and attended Ashton on Mersey Secondary School on Cecil Avenue, Sale.\n\nPilkington moved to London from Manchester to work with XFM as a producer, where he was later promoted to head of production. While there, he unintentionally caused Gail Porter to leave the station in tears after only one show; he criticised her performance, which Pilkington defended as an attempt to encourage improvement. After several years he began work on \"The Ricky Gervais Show\". Initially, Pilkington was solely the programme's producer. As Gervais and Merchant began to frequently invite him to make a cameo appearance, Pilkington's quirky persona came to light and his popularity increased. Pilkington was eventually included as a main presenter of the broadcasts, with large amounts of airtime devoted to his unusual thoughts on various subjects, or various childhood stories. In December 2005, Pilkington stood in for two BBC 6 Music shows for Nemone, and co-presented the shows with Russell Brand.\n\nPilkington's presence on \"The Ricky Gervais Show\" podcasts significantly increased his fame. He has often been mentioned in interviews given by Gervais, and is often the victim of Gervais' practical jokes. After Pilkington said, \"I could eat a knob at night\" on the podcast (in relation to \"I'm a Celebrity\" contestants eating a kangaroo penis), Gervais encouraged his listeners to sample the sound bite and mix it into dance music. The phrase spawned several dance music mixes, T-shirts, and other merchandise. Many of Pilkington's quotes have since gained publicity, particularly on the Internet. Reuters, commenting on this issue, described Pilkington as a \"phenomenon\" who had made \"Internet history\".\n\nOn 23 November 2010, while appearing live on Richard Bacon's Radio 5 Live afternoon show, Gervais surprised Pilkington with an on-air phone call. This led to a conversation where Pilkington, who claimed to have been interrupted while grouting his kitchen, said he had not yet been paid for his work on \"An Idiot Abroad\" and concluded the interview with an off-the-cuff link into the hourly news. \n\nPilkington has worked independently of Gervais and Merchant on several projects. He appeared as a guest on the shows \"Flipside TV\" and \"The Culture Show\", and appeared in several short films as part of the Channel 4 project \"3 Minute Wonders\".\n\nMerchant and Gervais have repeatedly denied claims that Pilkington's persona is their creation. In an on-air response to similar claims made by Chris Campling during a broadcast on XFM, Merchant stated that he would be \"ashamed\" if the radio show was scripted, and added that \"I would not have squandered a character that good on this poxy radio station\". Gervais concurred, pointing out that writing a single series' worth of six half-hour episodes of shows such as \"The Office\" and \"Extras\" took the two of them up to a year. An interviewer for \"The Daily Telegraph\" concluded that Pilkington's persona is genuine.\n\nPilkington appeared in an interview on Ricky Gervais's live stand-up comedy DVD, \"Politics\". The DVD of Gervais's film \"The Invention of Lying\" contains a special feature called \"Meet Karl Pilkington\" which documents his participation in the movie as a non-speaking caveman in another special feature, \"The Dawn of Lying\". He was given a small role in the final episode of \"Extras\".\n\nIn September 2010, Pilkington presented \"An Idiot Abroad\", a light-hearted travel documentary series that aired on Sky1 and that was produced by Gervais and Stephen Merchant, in which he visits the New 7 Wonders of the World while being directed by Gervais and Merchant into various activities along the way. He wrote a book to accompany the series.\n\nFollowing the success of the first series, Pilkington starred in the second series subtitled \"The Bucket List\", which debuted on 23 September 2011 on Sky 1. The premise of the series involves Pilkington trying to experience \"ultimate things to do before you die\" except that the list of activities is not entirely of his choosing. In June 2011, he won the Best Presenter award for \"An Idiot Abroad\" at the Factual Entertainment Awards. The third series of the show, \"An Idiot Abroad: The Short Way Round\" premiered in November 2012 and showed Pilkington and Warwick Davis travelling the Marco Polo route.\n\nPilkington has performed voiceover work for such clients as One Stop Office Shop, FreeView, Vodafone, HMV, Sony PSP, WHSmith, Wickes, and Unilever. \n\nHe made his acting debut on 12 April 2012 in the Channel 4 comedy-drama \"Derek\", portraying caretaker and bus driver Dougie. He left the show after the first episode of the second series. \n\nIn 2013–2015, he starred in a two-series Sky 1 documentary called \"The Moaning of Life\". \n\nIn 2018, he co-wrote and starred in a Sky 1 scripted sitcom called \"Sick of It\".\n\nIn 2014, Pilkington designed and signed his own card for UK charity Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. The campaign was launched by crafting company Stampin' Up! UK, and his card, along with those designed and signed by other celebrities, was auctioned off on eBay in May 2014.\n\nPilkington has been in a long-term relationship with Suzanne Whiston, a former producer at the BBC, since the 1990s. He has supported Manchester United since the 1990s, having previously supported Manchester City as a child.\n\n"}

Sw. Anand Prahlad, in his book \"Reggae Wisdom\", suggested that on this and previous album \"Bush Doctor\", Tosh was seeking to portray himself in the role of \"healer and prophet\".\n\nThe album peaked at number 17 in Germany, 25 in Austria, 27 in Sweden, 44 in the Netherlands, and at 123 on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe album was reissued in 2002 with five bonus tracks.\n\nLester Bangs, reviewing the album for \"Rolling Stone\", saw \"Mystic Man\" as an improvement over \"Bush Doctor\" and viewed the 9-minute disco-driven \"Buk-in-Hamm Palace\" as the album's strongest track. Jonathan Daümler-Ford, for the \"Birmingham Daily Post\", thought it lacked the immediate impact of the previous album, but \"sneaks up from behind\" with what he described as \"one of the best reggae tracks I have heard (\"Can't You See\") and several close contenders\", calling it a \"slow starter but a strong stayer\". Ralph Heibutzki, for Allmusic, saw the album as Tosh reasserting his \"cranky contrarian militancy\", \"a proud declaration of Tosh's lifestyle, which he pointedly contrasts against Western consumerist decadence\", wiewing \"The Day the Dollar Die\" as a roots reggae classic.\n\nDave Thompson saw the album as a disappointment, picking out \"Jah Seh No\" and \"Rumours of War\" as highlights. \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau wrote: \"Mysticism should keep its own counsel; boast about it, translate your supposed experience of the ineffable into any but the most simpleminded ideology, and ninety-five times out of a hundred you'll sound like a smug asshole. Tosh's ever more preachy vocal stance does nothing for his dopey puns ('shitty' for 'city,' far out), his confused political-economic theories, or his equation of hamburgers with heroin. And his musicians sound like the bored pros rockers so often turn into.\"\n\nAll tracks composed by Peter Tosh\n\n\n"}

It was released as a single in November 1987, reaching No. 69 in the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and later reaching No. 39 on the UK Singles Chart on its re-release in December 1991.\n\nThe song originated from a previously unreleased song called \"PSA\" (\"Public Service Announcement\"); the two are very similar in melody and tempo. \"PSA\" was itself later reworked and released as a single in 2003, under the title \"Bad Day\". In an interview with \"Guitar World\" magazine published in November 1996, R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck agreed that \"End of the World\" was in the tradition of Bob Dylan's \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\".\n\nThe track is known for its quick flying, seemingly stream of consciousness rant with a number of diverse references, such as a quartet of individuals with the initials \"L.B.\": Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs. In a 1990s interview with \"Musician\" magazine, R.E.M.'s lead singer Michael Stipe claimed that the \"L.B.\" references came from a dream he had in which he found himself at a party surrounded by famous people who all shared those initials. \"The words come from everywhere.\" Stipe explained to \"Q Magazine\" in 1992. \"I'm extremely aware of everything around me, whether I am in a sleeping state, awake, dream-state or just in day to day life, so that ended up in the song along with a lot of stuff I'd seen when I was flipping TV channels. It's a collection of streams of consciousness.\"\n\nThe song was included on the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum of songs thought to be \"lyrically questionable\" after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe song was played repeatedly for a 24-hour period (with brief promos interspersed) to introduce the new format for WENZ 107.9 FM \"The End\", a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio in 1992. When the station underwent a new format change in 1996, they again played the song in 24-hour loop. There was a documentary film made about the station entitled \"The End of the World As We Knew It\", released in 2009 which featured many of the former staffers and jocks.\n\nThe song was featured in several satirical videos on YouTube, in connection with the prediction of radio pastor Harold Camping of Family Radio, that the world would end on May 21, 2011 (with earthquakes rolling around the world in each time zone; \"that's great, it starts with an earthquake\". A Philadelphia radio station formerly owned by Camping stunted its new format by repeatedly playing the song.) Also, before the supposed Mayan apocalypse on December 21, 2012, sales for the song jumped from 3,000 to 19,000 copies for the week. Alternative radio station CFEX-FM in Calgary, Alberta, Canada stunted by playing the song all day on December 21, 2012, interspersed with \"Get to Know a Mayan\" and \"Apocalypse Survival Tips\" segments.\n\nAmid the global coronavirus pandemic, the song received an increase in downloads and streaming in March 2020 alongside other apocalypse and sickness themed songs. Online downloads of the song rose 184 percent and streams rose 48 percent.\n\nThe music video was directed by James Herbert, who worked with the band on several other videos in the late 1980s. It depicts a teenage skateboarder, Noah Ray, in a cluttered room of an abandoned, half-collapsed farmhouse. As he rummages through the junk, which includes several band pictures and flyers, he shows off various toys and items to the camera and plays with a dog that wanders into the house. As the video ends, he goes shirtless and starts performing skateboard tricks while still inside the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR.E.M.\n\n\n"}

He primarily played as an attacking midfielder, but could also operate as a winger or second striker.\n\nHe has played with clubs in his homeland, playing for Dinamo Zagreb before sparking controversy by making a move to their fierce rivals Hajduk Split in January 2005. A transfer to England with Portsmouth soon followed in August 2006, and after several years of attempting to hold on to their key players, Portsmouth decided to sell him at the start of the 2009–10 season, opening the way for a move to Tottenham in September 2009, where he was reunited with his former manager at Portsmouth, Harry Redknapp.\n\nHailed as the next Robert Prosinečki, Kranjčar was given his international debut by his father Zlatko in August 2004. Since then, Kranjčar has represented his country in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008 and UEFA Euro 2012. So far he has won 81 caps for the Croatia national team, scoring 16 goals in the process. His latest match for the national team was on 15 October 2013, and he missed 2014 FIFA World Cup because of an injury.\n\nKranjčar is the son of former Dinamo Zagreb and Rapid Vienna forward Zlatko and he spent his childhood years in Austria, where his father was playing. Therefore, he holds an Austrian passport and this qualified him as a European Union player prior to the enlargement of the EU and Croatia's admission in 2013.\n\nKranjčar spent most of his youth playing for Dinamo Zagreb, and later, at the age of 17, became the youngest captain of the squad for the first time. He also became one of the youngest goalscorers in the Prva HNL as he scored on his league debut for Dinamo at the age of 16 before helping them win the double of a Croatian cup and a league title in 2003 and then the Croatian cup again the following season. Such abilities and assistance led him to become a fan favorite, he began to receive comparison to French football legend Zinedine Zidane.\n\nIn January 2005 he experienced a disagreement with the Dinamo Zagreb management, which led to a surprise transfer to Dinamo's biggest rivals, Hajduk Split, which was accomplished thanks to Hajduk's sporting director Igor Štimac for a reported fee of €1.88 million. Over 10,000 people came to Kranjcar's official unveiling at the Poljud stadium.\n\nKranjcar made his league debut for Hajduk on 26 February 2005 in a 2–2 draw against Osijek.\nHe scored his first goal for Hajduk on 23 April 2005 at Poljud in a 5–1 victory against NK Inter. He scored his second goal in the decisive 6–0 victory against Varteks on 28 May 2005.\nKranjčar helped Hajduk win the 2004–05 Prva HNL which was their 2nd league trophy in a row. Thanks to his fine games and good sportmenship Kranjčar became the fans' favourite player instantly. Despite having a lot of international offers from abroad, Niko decided to stay at Hajduk for the next season. In the 2005–06 Prva HNL he was Hajduk's top goalscorer, with 10 goals.\n\nAfter the 2006 World Cup, the world press hailed Kranjčar for his talents, and several clubs immediately showed interest in the young star. Among such clubs were Stade Rennais and the Spanish Club Celta Vigo. In August 2006, Rennes bid €4.5 million for Kranjčar, which Hajduk rejected, stating they felt they should get more for the player. Later on the same day, however, Kranjčar then moved for a reported £3.5 million (€5.2 million) to Portsmouth on 31 August 2006.\n\nKranjčar made his Premier League debut for Portsmouth on 1 October 2006 as he played all 90 minutes in their 2–1 away defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He scored his first Premier League goal on 31 March 2007 at Fulham, giving Portsmouth an early 1–0 lead in a match that eventually ended in a 1–1 draw. He made a total of 24 appearances and scored two goals in his first Premier League season. The following season, he played an integral role in Portsmouth's FA Cup win.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2008–09 season, AS Monaco apparently had a bid of £12 million rejected for Kranjčar, however this was denied by Monaco. On 12 February 2009, with Portsmouth battling relegation, Kranjčar publicly declared his desire to quit Portsmouth and move to a bigger club. Arsenal and AS Monaco have previously been linked with moves for the Croatian International. Everton manager David Moyes also expressed an interest in signing Kranjčar as a replacement for long-term absentee Mikel Arteta. In August, Kranjčar stated: \"For now I am staying, but we have not strengthened like I would have liked us to. That's why I will not sign a new contract. It's one more season for me and then I'm off\".\n\nOn 1 September 2009, Kranjčar joined Tottenham Hotspur from Portsmouth after the two clubs agreed a transfer fee of around £2.5 million, although the actual price was undisclosed. The deal was completed just before the transfer deadline passed with him signing a four-year contract. It was reported that Everton had made a late bid to sign Kranjčar, but the player opted to sign for Spurs, stating that: \"Everton is also a big club but, in the end, the tradition and greatness of Tottenham made the difference. I also knew manager Harry Redknapp, and Luka Modrić and Vedran Ćorluka told me great things about the club\". Kranjčar made his debut for Tottenham as a substitute in the 3–1 defeat to Manchester United at home. On 26 September 2009, Kranjčar made his first Premier League start for Tottenham in a 5–0 home thrashing of Burnley. He scored his first goal for the club in a Premier League match away to Bolton Wanderers on 4 October 2009. On 22 November 2009, Kranjčar scored for Tottenham in a 9–1 home thrashing of Wigan Athletic, with Jermain Defoe scoring a record equalling five. On 16 December 2009, Kranjčar grabbed a brace in a 3–0 home victory over Manchester City. On 20 March 2010, Kranjčar scored the winning goal in a 1–2 away victory over Stoke City. Kranjčar has found difficulty being chosen in starting line-ups, due to the rise in prominence of Gareth Bale, who also plays in his position. However Kranjčar continued to make a pivotal contribution to the season scoring late winning goals in two consecutive matches, coming on as a substitute against Bolton Wanderers in a 2–1 victory at White Hart Lane, and away to Sunderland in another 2–1 victory. In the beginning of the 2011–12 season, Kranjčar scored a 35-yard goal during a pre-season friendly, a 5–3 win against Milton Keynes Dons.\n\nOn 6 June 2012, Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv confirmed the signing of Niko Kranjčar on a four-year contract. The transfer fee was estimated to be about £5.5 million. After his move to Dynamo Kyiv, Niko Kranjčar says he is \"happy\" and satisfied\" of joining Dynamo Kyiv and does admits his time at Tottenham was ‘disappointing’. Kranjčar revealed that Dynamo Kyiv first took interest in signing him in 2003 during his time at Dinamo Zagreb. He scored twice on Matchday 5 against Volyn Lutsk. He scored another two goals against Karpaty Lviv on 14 September 2012. After having a good beginning of the season, in November Kranjčar felt an old ankle injury, which left him out of the game until the end of the year. He came back just in time for the second half of the season, after the winter break, but managed to make only two appearances before he got injured again while performing for the Croatian national team in March 2013. This time he was left out of the pitch until the end of the season.\n\nAfter spending 2 years on loan at Queens Park Rangers from 2013 to 2015, Kranjčar returned to Dynamo Kyiv's first team.\n\nOn 2 September 2013, Kranjčar joined Queens Park Rangers on a season long loan to unite with his former boss Harry Redknapp, who signed two other players from former club Tottenham Hotspur. This was the third time Redknapp signed Kranjčar, having previously worked with him at Portsmouth and Tottenham. After a groin problem delayed his debut, Kranjčar made his first appearance for his new club against Yeovil Town, coming on as a second halftime substitute. He made his full debut before the Loftus Road crowd against Middlesbrough in late September 2013. Kranjčar scored his first goal of the season in the match against Millwall, when he also made his first assist of the season and was voted \"Man of the Match\". In January 2014 he scored once again to give QPR a 1–0 lead against Ipswich Town. He left the club on 1 July 2014 following the expiration of his loan, but returned on the last day of the summer transfer window on 1 September 2014 for another season-long loan.\n\nAfter being released by Dinamo Kyiv, he went to USA and trained with Cosmos. However, he could not be a part of the squad due to foreign players' rule. In the middle of the March 2016, when one of the foreign players obtained American citizenship, Kranjčar finally signed for Cosmos.\n\nOn 23 June 2016, Kranjčar signed for Rangers of the Scottish Premiership on a two-year deal, stating that it was a \"big honour and privilege\" and a \"big responsibility\" to be joining a club of such size. He made his debut for the club in a League Cup match against Motherwell on 16 July. and made his first start, three days later against Annan Athletic. Kranjčar scored his first goal for the club on 25 July, netting the third in a 3–0 win over Stranraer and netted his first league goal in a 2–0 win over Partick Thistle on 1 October. Kranjčar suffered a cruciate ligament injury in early October which would sideline him for the rest of the season. In January 2017, Kranjčar spoke about the progress of his rehabilitation and estimated a return in six-months; although he did acknowledge the severity of the injury could have led to him retiring. He made his return to competitive first-team action after eight months out, against Progrès Niederkorn in the Europa League on 29 June 2017. Kranjčar was released by the club on 23 March 2018, after struggling with injury throughout his spell in Glasgow.\n\nKranjčar was previously a part of the Croatian national Under-16, Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 teams before advancing to the senior national team. His senior debut for Croatia came on 18 August 2004 in a friendly match against Israel. He was a regular for Croatia during their qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup, making nine appearances and scoring two goals, including a brilliant single effort against Bulgaria. Niko was then chosen for \"Young guns firing for World Cup glory\" on eurosport.com with some of the greatest talents in the world, such as Lionel Messi, Lukas Podolski and future Pompey teammate Sulley Muntari. He went on to play in all of Croatia's three group stage matches at the final tournament, proving to be a prestigious player for his impressive performances.\n\nWith the departure of his father as national team manager, Kranjčar became a regular for Croatia in their qualifying campaign for Euro 2008, having appeared in all 12 matches and scoring two goals. The most famous of such was his long range opener for Croatia during their final match away to England. Croatia eventually won the game 3–2, resulting in England's failure to qualify for the final tournament. He then scored in a friendly match against Scotland with a spectacular effort from just inside the penalty area in a match played that ended 1–1, the equalising goal coming from Kenny Miller. He was a part of the Croatia team in Euro 2008 tournament, being a starter in 2 group match games and quarter-final game against Turkey. In Croatia's campaign for the 2010 World Cup he scored a goal against Kazakhstan. He was included in Croatia's 23-man squad for Euro 2012 and played in two out of three group stage games, missing only the last game against Spain. He missed the 2014 FIFA World Cup due to hamstring injury and since then, he has not received a single call-up for any of the national team's future matches. His last international game was on 15 October 2013.\n\nKranjčar was born to a retired Croatian footballer and manager Zlatko Kranjčar. He was married to Simona Fistrić and the couple lived in Cuffley, Hertfordshire. Fistrić gave birth on 7 March 2011 to a baby girl by the name of Loree. However, Kranjčar and Fistrić divorced less than a year after Loree's birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the next decade he served in a number of ships, among them the frigate \"Brandywine\" (during the later 1820s and early 1830s) and sloop-of-war \"Saint Louis\" (in the mid-1830s). He was promoted to lieutenant in December 1837 and was subsequently assigned to the U.S. Coast Survey, the New York Navy Yard, the steamer \"Fulton\" and storeship \"Erie\". \n\nBeginning in the mid-1840s his Navy service became intermittent, with a long period of \"waiting orders\" broken in 1847 by assignment to the steamer \"Scourge\".

Her family is Jewish; Weisberger was raised in Conservative Judaism and later Reform Judaism. She spent her early youth in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, a small town outside Scranton. At 11, her parents divorced and she and her younger sister, Dana, moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of the state, with their mother.\n\nAt Parkland High School, in South Whitehall Township near Allentown, Weisberger was involved in intramural sports, some competitive sports, extra projects, and organizations. She graduated in 1995.\n\nShe attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where she was an English major and a sorority member of Alpha Epsilon Phi, graduating in 1999. After college, she traveled as a backpacker through Europe, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Thailand, India, Nepal, and Hong Kong. Returning home, she moved to Manhattan and was hired as Wintour's assistant at \"Vogue\". She was there for ten months before leaving along with features editor Richard Story. While Weisberger said she felt out of place at the magazine, managing editor Laurie Jones later said, \"She seemed to be a perfectly happy, lovely woman\".\n\nWeisberger and Story began working for \"Departures Magazine\", an American Express publication, where she wrote 100-word reviews and became an assistant editor. She also published a 2004 article in \"Playboy\" magazine.\n\nAfter mentioning her interest in writing classes to her boss, Richard Story, he referred her to his friend Charles Salzberg. She started writing a story about her time at Vogue, and completed it by trying to write 15 pages every couple of weeks. After repeated urgings, she showed the finished work to agents; it sold within two weeks.\n\nIn 2003, Weisberger's first book, \"The Devil Wears Prada\", was released and spent six months on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List. The book is a semi-fictional but highly critical view of the Manhattan elite. As of July 2006, \"The Devil Wears Prada\" was the best-selling mass-market softcover book in the nation, according to \"Publishers Weekly\". The book is largely based on Weisberger's experience at \"Vogue\". There is much speculation that the character of Miranda Priestly represents aspects of Anna Wintour. The fictional Elias-Clark publishing company is said to be modeled after Condé Nast.\n\nThe book calls into light the many aspects of one's first job. It also highlights the presumed insanity of the fashion world and the difficulty and pressure a person goes through when trying to balance a demanding job with an adequate social life. The book provides a comical insight into the fashion world. While this book was met with stunning success, one former employee of Anna Wintour, Kate Betts, criticized Weisberger and the book in \"The New York Times\", saying that Weisberger and Wintour are the direct counterparts of their fictional characters and that \"Andrea … is just as much a snob as the snobs she is thrown in with.\" She further hints that Andrea's portrayal within the book does not suggest that she is in any way above fetching lattes.\nLauren Weisberger has published a sequel of the book: \"Revenge Wears Prada: The Devil Returns\".\n\nA movie of the same name, based on the novel, was released by 20th Century Fox in June 2006, starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. The film grossed $27.5 million in its opening weekend, amassing total U.S. sales of nearly $125 million and total worldwide sales of $326 million, making it one of the top-grossing films of summer 2006. The film departs from the book in several ways. For example, Andrea is a graduate of Northwestern University in the film, not Brown. The film shows Miranda requesting Andrea go to Paris with her because Emily is unwell. The book, in further detail, has Emily catching mono, thus not being able to go with Miranda. Further, Lily, Andrea's best friend, is the main reason Andrea leaves Paris in the book. Lily is an alcoholic and gets into a car crash. Andrea has to decide whether to stay with Miranda or go to her friend. The movie does not include any of these details and ends with Andy and Miranda viewing one another with mutual respect. The book affords Andrea no such gratitude as she curses Miranda to her face and is consequently fired.\n<br>\n<br>\nWeisberger made a brief cameo in the film as the twins' nanny.\n\nIn October 2006, Fox television acquired the television rights to the book, and a television series of the same name had been expected to be developed by Fox in 2007. Weisberger has since appeared on the television talk shows \"Tout le monde en parle\" and \"The Today Show\".\n\nWeisberger's second novel, \"Everyone Worth Knowing\", based upon the trials and tribulations of the New York City public relations world, was published in fall 2005. It received generally unfavorable reviews. \"The New York Times Book Review\" described it as \"fatuous, clunky.\" \"USA Today\" called it \"lackluster imitation,\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\" said it was \"ho-hum rehash.\" Despite debuting on \"The New York Times\" Best Sellers List at No. 10, it dropped off the list in two weeks and was noted for its disappointing sales. Publisher Simon & Schuster paid Weisberger $1 million for the novel. The audio book was read by actress Eliza Dushku.\n\nIn some European countries this novel was released as \"Gossip and Gucci\".\n\n\"Chasing Harry Winston\" is Weisberger's third novel, which was released on May 27, 2008. It was released in the United Kingdom on May 19, 2008. The main characters are three best friend New Yorkers, Emmy, Adriana and Leigh, who are facing the horror of turning 30. Recently dumped Emmy promises to make a drastic change and find guys from every continent for casual affairs. Beautiful Brazilian Adriana in turn tries to leave her old lifestyle of sleeping around and living off daddy in order to get a Harry Winston ring on her finger before the first wrinkles start showing. Leigh, the one with the perfect life, does not know what she needs in order to be happy and to be able to relax.\n\nIn September 2008, it was announced that Universal Pictures had picked up the rights to the book. It was also announced that the book will be translated into French, Dutch and Italian.\n\nIn some European countries this novel was released as \"Chanel Chic\", and in Italy the title is \"Un anello da Tiffany & Co\" (\"A ring from Tiffany & Co\").\nIn France the title is \"\" (Sex, Diamonds, and maybe more...)\n\nThe book was panned by critics and was voted \"#1 Worst Book of 2008\" by \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\n\"Last Night at Chateau Marmont\" was released in August 2010. It debuted at No. 9 on the \"New York Times Bestseller List\" on September 5, 2010.\n\n\"Revenge Wears Prada,\" a sequel to \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" was released on June 4, 2013. It debuted at No. 3 on the \"New York Times Bestseller List.\"\n\n\"The Singles Game\" was released in 2016.\n\n\"When Life Gives You Lululemons,\" a second sequel to \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" was released in 2018. It follows the character of Emily Charlton, Miranda's Priestly's assistant played by Emily Blunt in the movie adaptation.\n\nHer short story \"The Bamboo Confessions\" is included in the anthology \"American Girls About Town\", and is about a New York City backpacker who travels around the world and begins to view her love life back home in a different light.\n\nWeisberger lives in New York City with her husband, two kids, and dog, Stella.\n\n\n"}

The house is located in the upper-Austrian town of Braunau am Inn. The former tavern was a cultural center for the Nazi party during the Third Reich. After the heritage house was used as a homestead as well as a workshop for people with disabilities it is now standing empty since 2011.\n\nAfter the FPÖ (Austrian Freedom Party) took part in the government under Jörg Haider in early 2000, the \"Braunauer Rundschau\" (Braunau review) started to collect signatures under the slogan \"Braunau setzt ein Zeichen\" (Braunau sets a sign). Andreas Maislinger, an Austrian historian and founder of Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service and Braunau Contemporary History Days, reacted on the call and suggested setting up a \"House of Responsibility\" in the house where Adolf Hitler was born.\n\nThe \"Braunau review\" presented the idea of Andreas Maislinger on May 4, 2000:\n\nVolunteers from EU-countries, Austrian Zivildieners and former Austrian Servants Abroad should work and live together in the house. Because of this there should take place a constant exchange of ideas. The 'House of Responsibility' should be something completely new, split into three stories, where the 'unwanted inheritance' and the refurbishment of the background of the NS should take place on the first floor. The second floor will be devoted to the present, and concrete help for people will be offered for example by the Austrian Service Abroad and also by human rights – and third-world projects. On the third floor ideas for a more peaceful future should be worked out.\n\nPhilosophical basis for this project is the book 'Das Prinzip Verantwortung' (The concept responsibility) written by Hans Jonas in 1979.\n\nThe project couldn't be realized in the following years but the idea of taking responsibility remained. In 2005 the owner of a house close to where Hitler was born offered his house for the project. In 2002 members of Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service (AHMS) remembered the Austrian Righteous Among the Nations in front of Hitler's birth house. In October 2009 mayor Gerhard Skiba argued for the first time in support of a 'House of Peace' or 'House of Responsibility' in Hitler's Birthhouse in Austria's Newspaper Kurier.\n\nIn the first half of 2014 the HRB gained increasing support by the public and by acknowledged international organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League in New York, the Auschwitz Jewish Center in Oswiecim, the European Roma Rights Center in Budapest and the John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall in Nanjing. The final decision upon the use of Hitler's birth house has not been made yet.\n\n\n\n"}

Barbacoan is often connected with the Paezan languages (including Páez); however, Curnow (1998) shows how much of this proposal is based on misinterpretation of an old document of Douay (1888). (See: Paezan languages.)\n\nOther more speculative larger groupings involving Barbacoan include the Macro-Paesan \"cluster\", the Macro-Chibchan stock, and the Chibchan-Paezan stock.\n\nBarboacoan consists of 6 languages:\n\n\n\nPasto, Muellama, Coconuco, and Caranqui are now extinct.\n\nPasto and Muellama are usually classified as Barbacoan, but the current evidence is weak and deserves further attention. Muellama may have been one of the last surviving dialects of Pasto (both extinct, replaced by Spanish) — Muellama is known only by a short wordlist recorded in the 19th century. The Muellama vocabulary is similar to modern Awa Pit. The Cañari–Puruhá languages are even more poorly attested, and while often placed in a Chimuan family, Adelaar (2004:397) thinks they may have been Barbacoan.\n\nThe Coconucan languages were first connected to Barbacoan by Daniel Brinton in 1891. However, a subsequent publication by Henri Beuchat and Paul Rivet placed Coconucan together with a Paezan family (which included Páez and Paniquita) due a misleading \"Moguex\" vocabulary list. The \"Moguex\" vocabulary turned out to be a mix of both Páez and Guambiano languages (Curnow 1998). This vocabulary has led to misclassifications by Greenberg (1956, 1987), Loukotka (1968), Kaufman (1990, 1994), and Campbell (1997), among others. Although Páez may be related to the Barbacoan family, a conservative view considers Páez a language isolate pending further investigation. Guambiano is more similar to other Barbacoan languages than to Páez, and thus Key (1979), Curnow et al. (1998), Gordon (2005), and Campbell (2012) place Coconucan under Barbacoan. The moribund Totoró is sometimes considered a dialect of Guambiano instead of a separate language, and, indeed, Adelaar & Muysken (2004) state that Guambiano-Totoró-Coconuco is best treated as a single language.\n\nThe Barbácoa (Barbacoas) language itself is unattested, and is only assumed to be part of the Barbacoan family. Nonetheless, it has been assigned an ISO code, though the better-attested and classifiable Pasto language has not.\n\nBelow is a full list of Barbacoan language varieties listed by Loukotka (1968), including names of unattested varieties.\n\n\n\nLoukotka (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items.\n\n\n\n"}

In his 21-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he played for the Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies, New York Yankees, Houston Astros, Milwaukee Brewers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, New York Mets, and Toronto Blue Jays. At the time of his retirement, Hawkins was the only active player to be a member of the 1,000-games-pitched club, and at 42 years of age, was the oldest active player in MLB.\n\nHawkins was born and raised in Gary, Indiana. Hawkins' father was absent and he was raised primarily by his mother, Debra, and his maternal grandparents. Hawkins attended West Side High School. Aside from baseball, Hawkins also competed in basketball and football. At West Side he competed in basketball against Glenn Robinson and received a full scholarship offer to play college basketball at Indiana State. His half-brother, Ronald Sewood, was his personal catcher for two years in high school and played college baseball briefly at Florida Memorial University.\n\nHawkins was drafted straight out of high school by the Minnesota Twins in the 1991 MLB draft and received a $47,500 signing bonus. He spent the next four years in the Twins' minor league system. His MLB debut early in the 1995 season was a disastrous start against the Baltimore Orioles, where he gave up seven earned runs in only an inning and two thirds of work. During his brief stint in the Majors during 1995, Hawkins made 6 starts with a 2–3 record and an 8.67 ERA. Hawkins bounced between the MLB club and Salt Lake of the Pacific Coast League between 1996 and 1997, compiling a 7–13 record in those years.\n\nBy the 1998 season, Hawkins was inserted into the Twins rotation. He led the team with 33 starts but also led the team in most runs allowed (126), walks (70) and the worst WHIP among Twins starters (1.53). He was the opposing starting pitcher during the perfect game by Yankees pitcher David Wells on May 17, 1998.\n\nIn 1999, Hawkins suffered one of the worst statistical season in the majors and in his career. His 6.66 ERA was the worst in the Majors among starters with at least 30 starts. He was tied with Brad Radke for most losses on the team and allowed the most home runs on the pitching staff.\n\nBy 2000, Hawkins was in the Twins bullpen, appearing in 66 games while sporting an ERA of 3.39 along with 14 saves.\n\nIn 2001, Hawkins would revert to poorness, having one of the worst statistical seasons for a closer in the history of the MLB. He led the Twins in saves (28) but he had 5.96 ERA while having a WHIP of 1.91 in 61 games.\n\nHawkins rebounded the next two seasons, combining to pitch in 139 games while being replaced as closer by Eddie Guardado. He also had ERA's of 2.13 and 1.86 respectively.\n\nHawkins became a free agent after the 2003 season.\n\nHawkins drew interest from a number of teams before signing a three-year, $11 million deal with the Chicago Cubs after the 2003 season. Hawkins was signed by the Cubs to pitch the 8th inning to set up for Joe Borowski, but Borowski went down with an injury early in the season, and Hawkins took over closing duties. On September 11, Hawkins struck out the side on only nine pitches in a game against the Florida Marlins. Despite a better-than-average ERA of 2.63 on the year and 25 saves, Hawkins blew nine saves on the year, including two during a late-September skid that cost the Cubs the wild card. The blown saves earned him the ire of Cubs fans, who made a habit of booing him loudly at Wrigley Field when he came on in relief.\n\nHawkins appeared in 21 games for the Cubs in 2005 before being traded to the Giants. When Hawkins came back in 2005 as a member of the San Francisco Giants the Cub fans chanted \"Hawkins Sucks!\" which angered then manager Dusty Baker and first baseman Derrek Lee.\n\nOn May 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Hawkins to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for pitchers Jerome Williams and David Aardsma. Upon arrival in San Francisco, Hawkins was initially converted back into a set-up role, with the team cautiously optimistic about a return to form. However, Hawkins only showed brief flashes of his previous ability en route to a league-average performance for the Giants.\n\nBetween the Cubs and Giants, Hawkins 2005 record was 2–8 in 66 games. He had more hits than innings pitched while having a WHIP of 1.46.\n\nFollowing the 2005 season, Hawkins was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for left-handed reliever Steve Kline. He spent one season with the Orioles, going 3–2 with a 4.48 ERA in 60 games. He became a free agent after the season.\n\nOn December 5, 2006, Hawkins signed a one-year, $3.25 million contract with the Colorado Rockies. On July 8, 2007, Hawkins was the only Colorado player to help the groundskeepers and the entire Philadelphia ballclub with the tarp during a heavy storm in Denver. Despite pitching in the hitter-friendly Coors Field, he posted a 3.42 ERA in 62 appearances, including a scoreless 7th inning in the wild card playoff against San Diego. Hawkins gave up only one run and two hits in five innings of postseason work for the National League champions. Hawkins was part of the Rockies team that went to the World Series for the first time ever but ended up losing the series to the Boston Red Sox in a four-game sweep.\n\nOn December 9, 2007, Hawkins signed a one-year contract with the New York Yankees, reportedly worth $3.75 million. He became the first player since outfielder Paul O'Neill to wear the jersey number 21 for the Yankees.\nOn May 20, 2008, during a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Hawkins threw a head-high pitch over left fielder Luke Scott. Hawkins was ejected by home plate umpire Chuck Meriwether and Scott accused him for throwing the ball over his head. Hawkins was suspended for 3 games and fined an undisclosed amount.\n\nHawkins was designated for assignment on July 26. During his time with the Yankees in 2008, Hawkins made 33 relief appearances going 1–1 with a 5.71 ERA.\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the Houston Astros acquired Hawkins from the Yankees for minor leaguer Matt Cusick. Hawkins was an integral part of the Astros' late-season run, pitching 21 innings out of the bullpen and allowing just one earned run over that span (good for an ERA of 0.43). Hawkins signed a 1-year deal with the Astros to return for the 2009 season.\n\nHawkins continued his success in Houston, sporting an ERA of 2.13 in 65 games, the lowest ERA he had since 2003. He also saved 11 games. After the 2009 season, Hawkins left as a free agent.\n\nOn December 16, 2009, Hawkins signed a deal with the Milwaukee Brewers for 2 years and $7.5 million.\n\nIn 2010, he was 0–3 while only appearing in 18 games due to injury.\n\nIn 2011, he was 3–1 with a 2.42 ERA in 52 games. Through the 2011 season, he was third of all active pitchers in career games pitched (823) behind Arthur Rhodes and Mariano Rivera.\n\nThe Angels and Hawkins agreed to terms on a one-year contract for the 2012 season. Hawkins earned $3 million, going 2–3 with a 3.64 ERA.\n\nLaTroy Hawkins signed a minor league deal with invitation to spring training with New York Mets on January 31, 2013. He ended up making the team, pitching in 72 games and ending the season with a 3–2 record and 13 saves (his most since the 2004 season with the Chicago Cubs) with a 2.93 ERA.\n\nHawkins signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract to return to the Colorado Rockies on November 19, 2013, pending a physical. The contract became official on November 22, 2013.\n\nHawkins was named the Rockies' closer for the 2014 season and finished the year with a 3.31 ERA and 23 saves in 26 opportunities. On September 27, 2014, Hawkins made his 1,000th career appearance in a game the Los Angeles Dodgers and promptly got Darwin Barney to fly out to right field.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Hawkins announced that 2015 would be his last season in the MLB during an interview on MLB Network. He struggled at the beginning of the 2015 season, pitching to a 10.50 ERA in 7 games and recording only one save before heading to the disabled list. Shortly before his injury, Adam Ottavino replaced him as the closer.\n\nOn July 28, 2015, Hawkins and teammate Troy Tulowitzki were traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for José Reyes, Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro, and Jesús Tinoco. On August 5, Hawkins became the 13th player in MLB history to record a save against all 30 teams, closing out a 9–7 win over the Minnesota Twins, the team he started his professional career with. He also surpassed Darren Oliver as the oldest Blue Jay to record a save. Hawkins made 18 regular season appearances for the Blue Jays, pitching to a 1–0 record, 2.76 ERA, and 14 strikeouts in 16 innings.\n\nOn October 25, Hawkins officially announced his retirement from baseball.\n\nOn November 20, 2016, Hawkins was hired as a special assistant to the Minnesota Twins organization.\n\nHawkins' half-brother, Ronald Sewood, was sentenced to prison in 1996 at the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan. Hawkins visited Sewood whenever he played against the nearby Detroit Tigers. As of 2013, Hawkins estimated he spent $10,000 on books and magazine subscriptions for Sewood.\n\nAs of 2014, Hawkins and his wife, Anita, have a son named Dakari and a daughter named Troi.\n\nHawkins is good friends with former MLB outfielder Torii Hunter, as the two were teammates in Minnesota.\n\nHawkins is the godfather of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, whose father, Pat Mahomes, was a teammate of his on the Minnesota Twins.\n\n\n, or Baseball Reference Bullpen, or Retrosheet\n"}

The company was founded in 1899 by Herman Bergdorf and was later owned and managed by Edwin Goodman, and later his son, Andrew Goodman.\n\nToday, Bergdorf Goodman operates from two stores situated across the street from each other at Fifth Avenue between 57th and 58th streets. The main store, which opened at its current location in 1928, is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue. A separate men's store, established in 1990, is located on the east side of Fifth Avenue, directly across the street.\n\nBergdorf Goodman is a subsidiary of Neiman Marcus, which is owned by the private equity firm Ares Management.\n\nNeiman Marcus, which owns Bergdorf Goodman, has officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe company traces its origins to 1899 when Herman Bergdorf, an immigrant from Alsace, opened a tailor shop just above Union Square in downtown Manhattan.\n\nEdwin Goodman, a 23-year-old American Jewish merchant, based in Lockport, New York, moved to New York City to work as an apprentice for Bergdorf. Within two years, Goodman had raised enough money to purchase an interest in the business, which was renamed Bergdorf Goodman in 1901. In 1906, Bergdorf Goodman moved to a new location on 32nd Street, just west of Fifth Avenue and \"Ladies' Mile\". While Bergdorf preferred the less expensive side street location, Goodman prevailed with the new location and bought Bergdorf's interest in the company. Bergdorf would retire to Paris.\n\nAlthough Goodman had developed a good business as a ladies' tailor on 32nd Street, he decided to move uptown in 1914. Goodman constructed a five-story building at 616 Fifth Avenue, on the site of what is today Rockefeller Center. In 1914, Goodman became the first couturier to introduce ready-to-wear, making Bergdorf Goodman a destination for American and French fashion.\n\nThe store moved to its present location at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street in 1928, building its Beaux-Arts style store on the site of the Cornelius Vanderbilt II mansion. He was unsure of the success of the new store's location, as he was uncertain whether customers would follow the store uptown. So, Goodman designed the new store so that it could be subdivided into sections with storefronts that could be rented out if needed. Early tenants included Van Cleef & Arpels, the and Dobbs the Hatter. During the Great Depression, however, Goodman thrived, buying the entire building. Throughout the 1930s, Goodman purchased the mortgages of the surrounding businesses, eventually acquiring the entire block. During this period, Bergdorf Goodman was successful enough to have merited an expansion beyond the single store. However, Goodman preferred to operate in a single location where he would be able to personally maintain the quality of the merchandise and service.\n\nGoodman's son, Andrew, assumed the role of president in 1951 and succeeded as head of the company in 1953, following the death of his father. Andrew was responsible for enhancing Bergdorf's reputation and expanding its range of merchandise and services.\n\nDuring Andrew's tenure as chairman, Bergdorf opened a fur salon, developed the successful Bergdorf Goodman Number Nine perfume (\"Love Potion Number Nine\"), and created Miss Bergdorf, a ready-to-wear line for younger customers.\n\nThe store began a $1 million expansion in 1959 ($ million today) into two adjacent buildings. The Boys and Girls gift shop expanded into a whole floor, and the beauty salon and bridal, fur and men's departments also expanded. Eight years later, a $2.5 million expansion in 1967 ($ million today) nearly doubled the store's area, to .\n\nIn 1972, Andrew Goodman sold Bergdorf Goodman to Broadway-Hale Stores, which would become Carter Hawley Hale Stores (CHH) for $12.5 million ($ million today). CHH had acquired Neiman Marcus, a three-unit operation at the time, in 1969. By the time of the sale, Bergdorf Goodman was the only large high-quality specialty store in the U.S. that remained independently owned. However, its decision not to build suburban branches left it with a relatively modest profit margin. Goodman remained the landlord of the store and kept a penthouse apartment on the building's top floor.\n\nAt first, CHH considered building branch locations, ultimately only constructing one location, in nearby White Plains, New York, in 1972. This location eventually became a Neiman Marcus branch in 1981. To combat its image difficulties, the company hired Dawn Mello in 1975 as vice president of fashion. She was successful in reinvigorating the conservative store and became president in 1984. She left her post in 1989 to work for the floundering Italian fashion house Gucci, though she returned to her post as president in 1994.\n\nBergdorf Goodman's parent company became the object of takeover bids in the 1980s. As a way to maintain its independence, Carter Hawley completed a major financial restructuring. In 1987, Bergdorf Goodman was spun-off, together with Neiman Marcus and Contempo Casuals, to form Neiman Marcus Group. The new company was headquartered in Dallas, Texas, where the significantly larger Neiman Marcus had been based for 80 years.\n\nChairman and CEO Ira Neimark expanded the women's store three times in the 1990s. He moved the men's store across the street to the former FAO Schwarz space at 745 Fifth Avenue in 1990. This move allowed more space for women's fashions. In 1997, the former Goodman family apartment on the building's ninth floor became the John Barrett Salon and Susan Ciminelli Day Spa. In 1999, the Beauty Level opened directly below the main floor, offering a luxury spa and Goodman's Café, serving lunch and afternoon tea.\n\nIn 2002, Bergdorf Goodman underwent a major restoration, including a restoration of the main floor of the women's store. In 2003, the store introduced new boutiques for Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent. The Bergdorf Goodman Men's store features exclusive brands such as Loro Piana, Kiton, Brunello Cucinelli, John Lobb, Thom Browne, Bontoni, Tom Ford, and Charvet.\n\nOn May 2, 2005, two private equity firms, Texas Pacific Group and Warburg Pincus, acquired the Neiman Marcus Group and its Bergdorf subsidiary, in a leveraged buyout (LBO).\n\nThe store has been the subject of two documentary films: the 2001 film \"Dita and the Family Business\", exploring the store from the point of view of its owners, and the 2013 feature documentary \"Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's\", which features many testimonials from designers and celebrities. Cary Grant sent Doris Day on a shopping spree at the store in the 1962 movie \"That Touch of Mink\". The store has also made several appearances in the cartoon Neo Yokio. The protagonist, Kaz Kaan, and his rival, Arcangelo, both buy their suits from Bergdorf's. Most recently, Bergdorf Goodman was featured in a scene of the film \"Ocean's 8\" in which Sandra Bullock's character steals cosmetics from the store. In 2019, news journalist E. Jean Carroll alleged that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the 1990s. The store was prominently featured in the film ‘Arthur’ in 1981.\n\n\n"}

Impressed by his sense of humor, Henry promptly offered Sommers a place at court. He was soon in high favor with the King, whose generosity to him is attested by the accounts of the royal household.\n\nSommers remained in service to the King for the rest of Henry's life. In the King's later years, when he was troubled by a painful leg condition, it was said that only Sommers could lift his spirits.\n\nThe jester was also a man of integrity and discretion. Thomas Cromwell appreciated that Sommers sometimes drew the King's attention to extravagance and waste within the royal household by means of a joke.\n\nCourt jesters were permitted familiarities without regard for deference, and Sommers possessed a shrewd wit, which he exercised even on Cardinal Wolsey. He did occasionally overstep the boundaries, however. In 1535, the King threatened to kill Sommers with his own hand, after Sir Nicholas Carew dared him to call Queen Anne \"a ribald\" and the Princess Elizabeth \"a bastard\".\n\nRobert Armin (writer of \"Foole upon Foole\", 1600) tells how Sommers humiliated Thomas, the King's juggler. He interrupted one of Thomas's performances carrying milk and a bread roll. Will asked the King for a spoon; the King replied he had none. Thomas told him to use his hands. Will then sang:\n\nThis bit Harry I give to theeand this next bit must serve for me,Both which I'll eat apace.This bit Madam unto you,And this bit I my self eate now,And the rest upon thy face.\nHe then threw the milk in his face and ran out. Thomas was never at court again.\n\nSommers used his influence to compensate an uncle who had been ruined by an enclosure of common land, although it took a very subtle appeal by Sommers to Henry.\n\nIn Thomas Wilson's \"Arte of Rhetorique\" (1553–60), Will is quoted telling the financially hard-up King, \"You have so many Frauditors [Auditors], so many Conveighers [Surveyors], and so many Deceivers [Receivers] that they get all to themselves.\"\n\nSommers is believed to be portrayed in a painting of Henry VIII and family at the Palace of Whitehall. It was completed around 1544–45 by an unknown artist. Sommers also appears with Henry VIII in the Psalter of Henry VIII that was made for the King and is now in the British Library (MS Royal 2. A. XVI). A previously unknown picture in which Sommers appears was discovered in 2008 at Boughton House, Northamptonshire.\n\nToday, entertainers sometimes perform as 'Will' in Renaissance-themed entertainments such as Renaissance faires.\n\nAfter Henry's death, Sommers remained at court, eventually retiring during the reign of Elizabeth I.\n\nUnder Mary I, Will's role was mainly ceremonial, and as a sidekick to Mary's personal fool, Jane Foole. Will was reputed to be the only man who made Mary laugh, apart from John Heywood. Will's last public event was the coronation of Elizabeth I.\n\nHe was probably the William Sommers whose death is recorded in the parish of St. Leonards, Shoreditch, on 15 June 1560. A modern plaque in the church commemorates his burial there.\n\nWilliam Sommers made a number of appearances in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century drama and literature: for example, Thomas Nashe's \"Pleesant Comedie called Summers last Will and Testament\" (play first performed in 1592, published in 1600), Samuel Rowlands's \"Good Newes and Bad Newes\" (1622), and a popular account, \"A Pleasant Historie of the Life and Death of William Sommers\" (reprinted 1794). See also John Doran's \"History of Court Fools\" (1858).\n\nHoward Goorney played Will Sommers in two episodes of the 1970 BBC miniseries \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\". David Bradley played Will Sommers in the fifth episode of the third season of the Showtime series \"The Tudors\" (2009). The real Sommers was younger than Henry VIII.\n\nIn Margaret George's 1986 fictional \"The Autobiography of Henry VIII\", Will Somers protects the manuscript from Queen Mary, who would destroy it. \"Somers\" adds observations in his own hand that throw light on the old King's hypocrisies and failings.\n\nIn April 2016, Ottawa actor and playwright Pierre Brault premiered his solo show entitled \"Will Somers: Keeping Your Head\", speculating on Sommer's life and the role of comedy has in speaking to power.\n\nWill Somers is the main character in the historical novel \"The Last of Days\" by Paul C. Doherty. He is also the main character and narrator of the historical novel \"Fall of the House of Queens: Book One of The Shattered Rose Series\" (2017) by Shelly Talcott; in this fictional autobiographical account, while he is depicted as a hunchback (which historically he was not), he becomes a trusted confidente of not only Henry himself but also many of the important personages at court and all but one of Henry VIII's wives.\n\nWill Sommers has a major part in the plot of \"The Queen's Fool\", a 2004 historical fiction novel by Philippa Gregory. That book's protagonist is Hannah Green, a fictional jester at the court of Mary I of England. Sommers is shown as the very sympathetic mentor of the protagonist, who trains her in the art of being a jester and unstintingly shares with her his professional secrets.\n\n\n"}

It is the seat of Brome-Missisquoi, a regional county municipality. The population as of the Canada 2011 Census was 12,489.\n\nIn recent years, Cowansville has seen its commercial activity blossom mainly due to the fact that there is nothing in the surrounding towns.\n\nJacob Ruiter was the first person to settle on the current site of Cowansville. In 1800 he built a flour mill, and then a saw mill. In 1805, Ruiter named the small town as Nelsonville, in honour of British admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson, who was killed in the naval Battle of Trafalgar.\n\nThe city's current name is due to Peter Cowan, a merchant from Montreal who settled in the area in 1836 and become postmaster in 1841. In order to avoid the mail being sent inadvertently to another city named Nelsonville, close to Hamilton in Upper Canada, he decided to change its name.\nDuring the 1870s, the construction of the South Eastern Railway linking Montreal to Cowansville and the opening of the first bank, the Eastern Townships Bank, contributed to the expansion of the small city, which allows many businesses settle in the area. The municipality detached from the district of Dunham, and incorporated on the January 1, 1876 and officially was named Cowansville. In February of the same year James O'Halloran was acclaimed as Mayor by the town council. Cowansville saw a strong industrial growth during the 20th century, and became a city on June 25, 1931, and has grown since World War II by various annexations, such as Sweetsburg in 1964.\n\nThe municipality has a current population of over 12,000. The main economy is based on the industrial sector, in particular textiles. There is also a hospital, Brome-Missisquoi-Perkins, a municipal court, a federal penitentiary, and a Nature Centre close to Davignon Lake.\n\nCowansville is the seat of the judicial district of Bedford. It is also the birthplace of the artist and botanist Faith Fyles.\n\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n"}

At the time of his death at age 108, he had been one of only 14 known British survivors of that war.\n\nFinnigan’s family emigrated to Australia when he was a boy, where he gained experience with horses that was to stand him in good stead when he joined the Army in 1914. He was posted to France in 1916 as the driver of a team of six horses pulling an 18-pounder gun with the 15th Brigade Royal Field Artillery.\n\nAfter witnessing the carnage of the Somme offensive of 1916, Finnigan’s battery was one of those sent to assist the Italians after their reverses at Caporetto. By 1918, however, the battery had returned to Northern France to help stall the last great German offensive of the war. Finnigan also fought at the battle of Vimy Ridge, and was gassed in Passchendaele. In much later life, Alfred did not speak much of the war, but his great-nephew Mark recalls that one of the things that upset Alfred greatly was the death and suffering to the horses, as he was a great animal lover.\n\nFinnigan returned to Australia after the war, but opted to settle in England, working his passage back home as a seaman in 1927; the ship was called the \"Sir William Mitchel\" and was the last sailing to sail from Australia to England. Alfred was one of the only crew who were working their passage who could read and therefore wrote the ship's log, this log can be found in the Greenwich Maritime Museum in London.\n\nIn his personal life, Finnigan did not drink alcohol because his mother was treated so badly by his father, who was a drunk. Finnigan was also an atheist, mainly because his mother was a strict Catholic who had a very hard life and died a terrible death with cancer. Finnigan said if there was a God he would never have let a strict Catholic and kind lady like his mother be treated like this and die in such a way.\n\nAlong with other surviving World War I servicemen, he was awarded the French Légion d’Honneur in 1998.\n\n"}

He was employed by a federal New Deal agency in the 1930s. He is alleged to have been a Soviet spy and is understood to have founded the \"Ware Group,\" a covert group of operatives within the United States government aiding Soviet intelligence agents.\n\nHarold Maskell Ware, best known by his nickname \"Hal,\" was born on August 19, 1889, in Woodstown, New Jersey, the fourth child of Ella Reeve Bloor and her husband, Lucien Bonaparte Ware. Two of Ware's three older siblings died in early childhood.\n\nHis mother, Ella Bloor, converted to socialism during 1894-1895, when the family lived in Philadelphia. She became a lifelong activist in the labor movement, an early member of the Social Democracy of America (organized by Victor L. Berger and Eugene V. Debs), and a founder of the Communist Party of America. Ware was raised in a politically radical household, as a \"Red Diaper Baby.\"\n\nWhen he was 15, a case of measles left Ware with what doctors believed to be an early case of tuberculosis. His divorced mother moved with him and two brothers to the country for a year, while the rest of the family lived with his father in Philadelphia and attended school there. While his mother went weekly to Wilmington to speak and organize literature sales (as Delaware state organizer for the Socialist Party), Ware lived a rural life. Although he would return to school in the big city the following year, his orientation towards the countryside was firmly established.\n\nFollowing his graduation from high school (circa 1907), Ware enrolled in a two-year course in agriculture at Pennsylvania State College, later Penn State University.\n\nFollowing graduation, with financial help from his father he bought a grain and dairy farm near Arden, a small town near Philadelphia, where he learned farming firsthand. His brief experience as a working farmer made him almost a unique figure among pioneer members of the American Communist Party, a group almost exclusively composed of urban laborers, factory workers, or intellectuals (and mostly foreign-born).\n\nBefore WWI began, Ware had proven himself something of an agricultural innovator. Unable to afford equipment for his tractor, he welded together two harrows for horses. He adapted other horse-drawn gear for use in mechanized agriculture.\n\nAfter three years, Ware sold the farm and took a job in a shipyard as a draftsman, for which he had a natural faculty, until the end if WWI, whose armistice (November 1918) ended the torrent of government funding of the shipbuilding industry.\n\nAlthough not a delegate to its founding convention, Ware was a member of the Communist Labor Party of America (CLP) from the year of its origin, 1919, as were his mother and older sister, Helen. Ware and his family stayed with the CLP throughout its permutations, merging into the United Communist Party in 1920, into the Communist Party of America in 1921, and into the \"aboveground\" Workers Party of America in 1922, and eventually the Communist Party of the USA in 1929.\n\nAlmost immediately after the Party launched, federal and state authorities moved against the fledgling communist movement, forcing its adherents to make use of pseudonyms and to conduct their activities in secret. During the so-called \"underground period\" of the party, the agriculturally-oriented Ware used the pseudonym \"H.R. Harrow,\" publishing under that by-line in the communist press. (The pseudonym seems to have been a pun on his real given name, \"Harold.\")\n\nIn 1921, eager to study the plight of migrant farm workers firsthand with a view to organizing them for the Communist Party, Ware took a six-month trip around the United States, working harvests from the South to the Midwest, Northwest and then East again through the Upper Midwestern. This experience, combined with his previous agricultural experience, cemented Ware's place as the Communist Party's leading agricultural expert.\n\nThat fall, in addition to articles he wrote for the \"underground\" and \"aboveground\" Communist press, Ware compiled an exhaustive survey of American agriculture, including maps showing distribution of types of farms, farm incomes, and so forth in different sections of the country. The research was transmitted to the Communist International in Moscow, where it was read and praised by Lenin himself.\n\nIn late 1921, Ware attended the founding convention in New York of the Workers Party of America. He was elected an alternate to the governing Central Executive Committee of that organization. Ware was not typically a member of the Communist Party's top committees; he preferred to work in the agricultural sector rather than to engage in factional party politics.\n\nWare helped come up with the idea of using funds raised by the Friends of Soviet Russia organization to construct a model collective farm in Soviet Russia. His farm would serve as a model to help to alleviate the great Russian famine through production of grain plus firsthand demonstration of modern agricultural technique. An appropriation of $75,000 was granted for the project, with Ware's half-brother, Carl Reeve, traveling around the U.S., showing a motion picture depicting horrific conditions in Russia to help raise funds. Funding in hand, Ware went to the J.I. Case Farm Implement Co. and brokered a deal for 24 tractors and related equipment.\n\nIn May 1922, Hal and Cris Ware left his three children in America for Soviet Russia along with their tractors, implements, a complete medical unit, and several tons of food supplies. Also making the voyage was a doctor who spoke Russian and a group of American farmers to operate the machinery. The group had been assigned land in the village of Toikino in Perm guberniia, a substantial distance from any centers of population. They taught local peasants the basics of machine operation and plowed of land. Shortages of fuel, hauled by peasant wagons some from the nearest train station, severely hampered their efforts. At season's end, the American crew left for Moscow, whence they went home to America with thanks.\n\nThe next year, Soviet authorities were eager to expand the Toikino experiment of 1922. The Soviet People's Commissariat of Agriculture offered a large tract of fertile land in the Kuban region, just north of the Black Sea for a second model farm. Working again with the Friends of Soviet Russia organization, Ware organized a party of 40 to make the trip, including agricultural specialists, a doctor, and a nurse. He arrived in Soviet Russia to inspect the land designated for the project, only to be told by Soviet officials that the deal was off because local peasants had begun to allocate the land among themselves. A hasty search commenced for yet another site, in the North Caucasus, but the project was delayed.\n\nWare spent most of 1925 raising funds for his Soviet farming venture. This farm was organized as a Russian-American joint venture, with Ware as its American Director and then director of the state farm for three years. The project took over four flour mills and profitably operated them; they began to electrify the countryside.\n\nDuring winter 1928-29, Ware returned to the United States, where he attempted to interest American agricultural equipment manufacturers in the Soviet market. He convinced some companies to send test tractors and implements along with mechanics to assemble them. He stayed in the Soviet through the collectivization campaign of 1929-30.\n\nIn Spring 1931, Ware set out to organizing farmers and farm-workers in America. In the company of Lem Harris, another Communist Party agricultural expert, he made a year-long survey of American agriculture, echoing his research of 1921. The pair travelled by car around the United States, visiting nearly every state in the union, studying the sometimes desperate conditions which resulted from the collapse of agricultural prices associated with the Great Depression.\n\nShortly after completion of this task, Ware established a research center in Washington, DC called Farm Research, Inc. and recruited personnel to run it. The institute, funded by the Communist Party, published a newspaper called \"The Farmers National Weekly\" continuously throughout the Great Depression. (\"Farm Research\" received funding from the Robert Marshall Foundation, which also funded the Communist controlled news agency \"Federated Press.\")\nIn 1932, Ware was active in the Farmers Holiday Association on behalf of the Communist Party.\n\nIn his 1952 memoir, \"Witness,\" former Communist Whittaker Chambers wrote that from the time of Ware's death to his defection from the Communist Party in April 1938, he had been a member of the \"Washington spy apparatus\" headed by Colonel Boris Bykov, a Russian military intelligence officer. Chambers wrote that in addition to the four members of the group (also identified by Lee Pressman under oath to Congress in 1950):\n\nThere must have been sixty or seventy others, though Pressman did not necessarily know them all; neither did I. All were dues-paying members of the Communist Party. Nearly all were employed in the United States Government, some in rather high positions, notably in the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the National Labor Relations Board, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, the National Research Project — and others.\n\nChambers further wrote that \"by 1938, the Soviet espionage apparatus in Washington had penetrated the US State Department, the US Treasury Department, the Bureau of Standards and the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. These individuals \"supplied the Soviet espionage apparatus with secret or confidential information, usually in the form of official United States Government documents for microfilming,\" Chambers stated.\n\nIn the 1930s, Hal Ware was employed by the federal government, working for the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA), a New Deal agency which reported to the Secretary of Agriculture but was independent of the Department of Agriculture bureaucracy. According to Chambers, he also \"organized that Washington underground\" in which he was later to work. Introduced to him in the spring of 1934, Chambers described Ware at length:\n\nHe was as American as ham and eggs and as indistinguishable as everybody else. He stood about five feet nine, a trim, middle-aging man in 1934, with a plain face, masked by a quiet earnestness of expression wholly reassuring to people whom quickness of mind makes uncomfortable. Nevertheless, his mind was extremely quick. ...\n\nHe might have been a progressive country agent or a professor of ecology at an agricultural college. And yet there was something unprofessorially jaunty about the flip of his hat brim and his springy stride. ... It is true that he liked to drive his car at breakneck speed almost as well as to talk about soils, tenant farmers and underground organization ...\n\nHarold Ware was a frustrated farmer. The soil was in his pores. Unlike most American Communists, who managed to pass from one big city to another without seeing anything in the intervening spaces, Ware was absorbed in the land and its problems. He held that, with the deepening of the agricultural crisis, and with the rapid mechanization of agriculture, the time had come for revolutionary organization among farmers.\n\nWhen he came back from Soviet Russia in 1930, Ware carried with him $25,000 in US currency hidden in a money belt, funds from the Comintern for work among the farmers. It was with these funds that he had established Farm Research Inc. in Washington, DC. But his real mission was espionage, Chambers wrote:\n\nOnce the New Deal was in full swing, Hal Ware was like a man who has bought a farm sight unseen only to discover that the crops are all in and ready to harvest. All that he had to do was to hustle them into the barn. The barn in this case was the Communist Party. In the AAA, Hal found a bumper crop of incipient or registered Communists. On its legal staff were Lee Pressman, Alger Hiss and John Abt (later named by Elizabeth Bentley as one of her contacts). There was Charles Krivitsky, a former physicist at New York University, then or shortly after to be known as Charles Kramer (also, later on, one of Elizabeth Bentley's contacts). Abraham George Silverman (another of Elizabeth Bentley's future contacts) was sitting with a little cluster of communists over at the Railroad Retirement Board.\n\nOthers named by Chambers included Henry H. Collins, Jr., Laurence Duggan, Nathan Witt, Marion Bachrach, and Victor Perlo. Others subsequently mentioned in these ranks included John Herrmann, Nathaniel Weyl, Donald Hiss, and Harry Dexter White. According to Chambers, Ware was in close contact with and directly reported to J. Peters, \"the head of the underground section of the American Communist Party\":\n\n... By 1934, the Ware Group had developed into a tightly organized underground, managed by a directory of seven men. In time it included a number of secret sub-cells whose total membership I can only estimate — probably about seventy-five Communists. Sometimes they were visited officially by J. Peters who lectured them on Communist organization and Leninist theory and advised them on general policy and specific problems. For several of them were so placed in the New Deal agencies (notably Alger Hiss, Nathan Witt, John Abt and Lee Pressman) that they were in a position to influence policy at several levels.\n\nHarold Ware is said to have attended the Lenin School, a training institute for prospective party leaders from around the world operated by the Communist International.\n\n\nIn my desire to see the destruction of Hitlerism and an improvement in economic conditions here at home, I joined a Communist group in Washington, D. C, about 1934. My participation in such group extended for about a year, to the best of my recollection.\n\nPressman also indicated that in at least one meeting of his group, perhaps two, he had met Soviet intelligence agent J. Peters. Pressman's 1950 testimony provided the first corroboration of Chambers' allegation that a Washington, D.C., Communist group around Ware existed, with federal officials Nathan Witt, John Abt and Charles Kramer named by Pressman as members of this party cell.\n\nWare wanted me to try to get into the Foreign Service and be attached to the staff of William Bullitt, our first Ambassador to the Soviet Union ... I didn't think there was anything illegal about membership in the Ware unit, but nevertheless it was duplicitous ... I told Hal Ware that the Moscow idea was out and that I wanted to leave Washington and resign from government. He said: absolutely not. I forced his hand by committing an appalling breach of security. I showed up at a cell meeting with the girl I was having an affair with, a young lady who was not a Communist Party member and who had known nothing about the group. Ware withdrew his objections and I resigned from AAA.\n\n\nWare married Margaret Stephens: in 1916, she died three weeks following birth of their second child, Nancy Stephens Ware.\n\nIn August 1917, Ware married his second wife, Clarissa \"Cris\" Smith. (The couple had two children, Robin and Nancy, before divorcing in the early 1920s.) Ware's second marriage seems to have ended upon their return to the States. Cris took a job in the National Office of the Workers Party as head of the Committee for Protection of Foreign-Born Workers. She was reported in the Communist Party press as having died of \"acute pancreatitis, a rare disease of one of the digestive organs of the stomach,\" rumored to be a cover story for a botched illegal abortion, on September 27, 1923. Benjamin Gitlow wrote of a love triangle between Cris, Party national secretary C.E. Ruthenberg, and future secretary Jay Lovestone. Her death was \"a tragic end, for the last of Cris Ware's abortions proved fatal for her.\"\n\nWhile in Russia, Ware met Jessica Smith, working with the Quaker famine relief effort, the American Friends Service Committee. Back in New York City, the pair were married in January 1925 by Rev. Norman Thomas, soon to become a key political leader of the Socialist Party of America.\n\nOn August 13, 1935, Ware was critically injured in an automobile accident in the mountains near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania when his car collided with a coal truck. He died the next morning at the hospital in Harrisburg, never regaining consciousness after the crash.\n\nWare was memorialized with a chapter in the memoir written by his more famous mother, Ella Reeve Bloor, in 1940:\n\nAs a boy he loved the outdoors, was full of restless, eager vitality and bold curiosity. He had a startlingly vivid imagination, and an urge and talent for organizing that continued and marked his whole life. More than ordinarily shy, he forgot his shyness when engaged in one of his organizing ventures, and a flow of colorful, stirring talk would come from him so persuasive that those who heard him were completely carried away. He grew slim and tall, and when we moved to Arden was captain of the baseball team and a leader in tennis and other games. He missed a lot of school because of his siege of tuberculosis, but he read a lot and was always able to make up two or three years of ordinary schooling in a few months of intensive study. His interest in socialism began as early as I can remember.\n\nHal's interest in agriculture began early. He started raising truck in a small garden in Arden, and sold it around the countryside. His keen sense of beauty showed in the way he fixed up his boxes of vegetables to sell, arranging them artistically in green boxes.\n\nHe first planned to study forestry. He used to tell me his dreams of a life in the open, alone on a hillside, a sea of green tree tops below him. While taking the entrance exams for Pennsylvania State College he found that the forestry course would take four years, while there was a fine two-year agricultural course. Beginning to feel, too, that he did not want to live away from people, but among them, he chose agriculture. His interest in economics and politics developed intensely at this time, and while at college he wrote me constantly for the latest news of the socialist movement. We were always very close to one another, and no matter how many months or years we were apart, we could always pick up where we had left off.\"\n\nAfter his death, attorney John Abt married Jessica Smith, Ware's widow.\n\nHal Ware's half-brother, Carl Reeve, was also a lifelong activist in the Communist Party.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1955450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955450", "title": "Babaco", "text": "Babaco\n\nThe babaco (\"Vasconcellea × heilbornii\"; syn. \"Carica pentagona\"), is a hybrid cultivar in the genus \"Vasconcellea\" from Ecuador. It is a hybrid between \"Vasconcellea cundinamarcensis\" (syn. \"Carica pubescens\", \"Mountain Papaya\".), and \"Vasconcellea stipulata\" (syn. \"Carica stipulata\", \"Toronche\".).\n\nIt can grow at high altitudes (over 2,000 m), and is the most cold-tolerant plant in the genus \"Vasconcellea\". The babaco is classified as a herbaceous shrub like \"Carica papaya\" (pawpaw or papaya) but unlike papaya it produces only female flowers. The babaco plant can produce from 30–60 fruits annually, and has an average life span of about eight years. The small plant is better suited as a container specimen than its cousin the papaya, which needs constant moisture and high temperatures to survive.\n\nThe plant is easy to cultivate under greenhouse conditions (Kempler et al., 1993). Propagation of the plant is achieved by rooting axillary shoots. Stem sections root poorly. The opening of axillary buds and subsequent shoot growth is stimulated by removing the apical meristem. The shoots are cut at 15–25 cm long and only the apical leaf is kept. The basal area of the stem is mildly injured and dipped in 0.4% IBA rooting powder and planted into suitable rooting media such as peat:perlite:sand and placed under intermittent mist. The cutting can be ready for transplanting within 3 weeks.\n\nIn contrast to the tropical papaya, babaco require a cool subtropical climate. Recommended greenhouse minimum temperature of 10 °C at night, 12 °C during the day, and 18 °C for fruit to ripen quickly and uniformly. Excessively low temperatures cause fruit to mature with rough, pitted skin.\n\nThe flowering habit is indeterminate. Under greenhouse conditions, plant growth during winter month (October- March at 49°N) is slow, and flowers senesce and fail to set fruit (Kempler et al., 1993). In Ecuador, the trees begin cropping 10 months after planting and continue bearing for 6 months, producing about 40 fruit/tree with each weighing about 1-1.5 kg, in the greenhouse we produced about 32 kg fruit per square meter in 16 months when planted 0.8 plants per sq. meter, and 25 kg sq. meter after 12 months space at 3 plants sq. meter. Because of the heavy fruit load a support system for the plants was required. Small fruit size can be achieved by growing plants at high densities. Fruit begins to mature with gradual color change from green to yellow and, if harvest it delayed, the fruit stalk will abscise and fruit will drop and bruise. The delicate-skinned fruit is harvested with pruners with a short stalk and handled carefully. In northern climate, ripening begins in November (March planting), and continues until June. During this period new flowers are set (April–September) and the second crop starts to ripen in November, the plant is cut above the last-formed fruit as flowers senesce in October. After the end of the second season, cropping plants can be cut and rejuvenated from the base or replaced with new plants.\n\nIt is a small, unbranched or sparsely branched tree reaching 5–8 m tall. The fruit differs from the related papaya (\"C. papaya\") in being narrower, typically less than 10 cm in diameter. The babaco fruit is seedless and the smooth skin can be eaten, and is said to have tastes of strawberry, papaya, kiwi and pineapple. The fruit is pentagonal in shape, therefore giving it the scientific name of \"Carica pentagona\". The fruit is not especially acidic, but contains papain, a proteolytic enzyme, which may cause mild irritation or \"burns\".\n\nLike the papaya, the babaco is grown for its edible fruit and for its fruit juice. Cultivation away from its native range has been successful as far south as New Zealand, and as far north as California, some regions of England, Guernsey, Channel Islands, and somewhat also in Italy (mostly Sicily and Calabria).\n\n"}

R. Grace and Company.\n\nGrace was born in Ireland in Riverstown near the Cove of Cork to James Grace and Eleanor May Russell (née Ellen) while the family was away from home, and raised on Grace property at Ballylinan in Queens (now Laois) County near the town of Athy. He was a member of a prominent and well-to-do family. In 1846, Grace sailed for New York against the wishes of his father, and worked as a printer's devil and a shoemaker's helper before returning to Ireland in 1848.\n\nHis nephew, Cecil Grace, attempted a crossing of the English Channel in December 1910 in an airplane, flying from Dover to Calais. However, in coming back he became disoriented and over Dover flew northeast over the Goodwin Sands toward the North Sea and was lost.\n\nWilliam and his father, James Grace, traveled to Callao, Peru, in 1851, seeking to establish an Irish agricultural community. James returned home but William remained, where he began work with the firm of John Bryce and Co., as a ship chandler.\n\nIn 1854, the company was renamed Bryce, Grace & Company, in 1865, to Grace Brothers & Co., and then W. R. Grace and Company.\n\nOpposing the famous Tammany Hall, Grace was elected as the first Irish American Catholic mayor of New York City in 1880. He conducted a reform administration attacking police scandals, patronage and organized vice; reduced the tax rate, and broke up the Louisiana Lottery. Defeated in the following election, he was re-elected in 1884 on an Independent ticket but lost again the following time. During his second term, Grace received the Statue of Liberty as a gift from France.\n\nGrace was a renowned philanthropist and humanitarian, at one point contributing a quarter of the aid delivered to Ireland aboard the steamship \"Constellation\" during the Irish Famine of 1879. In 1897, he and his brother, Michael, founded the Grace Institute for the education of women, especially immigrants.\n\nOn September 11, 1859, William was married to Lillius Gilchrist (1839–1922), the daughter of George W. Gilchrist, a prominent ship builder of Thomaston, Maine, and Mary Jane (née Smalley) Gilchrest.

He is famous for arming his troops with arquebuses and donning the yatagarasu as his family crest.\n\nThere were three people known as Saika (Suzuki) Magoichi, included Suzuki Sadayu (鈴木佐大夫, 1511–1585, true name Suzuki Shigeoki (鈴木重意)), Suzuki Shigetomo (鈴木重朝, 1561–1623) and Suzuki Shigehide (鈴木重秀,  – ).\n\nShigeoki (鈴木重意, 1511–1585), also known as Suzuki Sadayū (鈴木佐大夫), was Shigehide and Shigetomo's father (though the former is disputed). Since records regarding the first half of his life are scant, it is speculated that he traveled as a mercenary. He was employed by the Hatakeyama clan and was a major contributor for repelling the Miyoshi clan. His reputation as a fearsome warrior began to spread and he became a kokujin in the area. When the Miyoshi clan were being attacked by Oda Nobunaga in 1570, the Ishiyama Hongan-ji mob assisted the resistance against the conqueror. Shigeoki came to their aid and led 600 riflemen into battle. His efforts won him fame when he injured one of Nobunaga's valued generals, Sassa Narimasa. Kennyo continued to count on Shigeoki's reinforcements. During this time, Nobunaga was said to have called him \"Kennyo's left and right-hand man\".\n\nDuring the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, Shigeoki aided Tokugawa Ieyasu and surrendered to Toyotomi Hideyoshi's vast army after the battle's conclusion. Though he swore to serve Hideyoshi, Tōdō Takatora suspected that keeping a formidable enemy within their ranks was too risky to trust. Therefore, Shigeoki was sentenced to commit suicide. He died when he was 75. His four sons survived him. Their names were Shigekane, Shigehide, Yoshikane, and Shigetomo.\n\nSuzuki Shigehide is perhaps the better known of the three, known for supporting the Ikkō resistance against Oda Nobunaga during the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War. Shigehide (鈴木重秀 or 鈴木重次,  – ) was possibly one of Shigeoki's sons. He is said to be his second eldest son, but the truth behind the matter remains unknown. This is mainly because his name isn't listed in historical records available to the public, making the authenticity of the \"Shigehide\" name even more dubious. Though said to be a warrior of distinguished prowess, details regarding his services remain scant. Aside from his distinct hatred for Nobunaga, the rest of his history is filled with half-truths, rumors, or theories. According to the Sengoku Engi, he was said to have been a great warrior.\n\nIt is said that he participated during the Hongan-ji riots as well and led 3,000 gunmen into battle. He is accredited for causing Harada Naomasa's death on the field. Despite being allied with the Miyoshi clan, legends state that Shigehide empathized with the Honganji rebels and was only loyal to them. When the Saika group surrendered to Hideyoshi years later, Shigehide was said to have tried to save his family from destruction. However, he couldn't convince Hideyoshi to spare them and his family's property fell into ruin.\n\nFrom here, the tales surrounding his fate differ from one another. One story says that he served Hideyoshi briefly before he also decided to commit suicide. Another states that he faithfully continued to serve Hideyoshi until Sekigahara and joined the Eastern army. There, he was employed by Date Masamune to be his secondary rifle troop. A few tales said that he became a wanderer and died as a hermit late in his life. After Torii Mototada's downfall during the battle of Sekigahara, he is said to have lived the rest of his days as a rōnin in Mito Domain.\n\nSuzuki Shigetomo (鈴木重朝, 1561–1623) was one of Shigeoki's sons. Like Shigehide, he fought alongside his father during the Ikko sect's riots. After his family fell into ruin, Shigetomo became one of Hideyoshi's generals. He participated in the Korean campaign by sending men from his station, Nagoya Castle. He continued to serve the Toyotomi family and was in the Western army's ranks during the Sekigahara Campaign. He participated in the Siege of Fushimi. Following the Battle of Sekigahara, he was spotted by Date Masamune and joined his clan. Under his orders, he was sent to act as one of Tokugawa Yorifusa's high-ranked bodyguards. He died due to natural causes at age 63. He was said to have been survived by two sons.\n\nIt is unclear whether he or his descendants were known under the \"Magoichi\" name when he became a part of the samurai class.\n\nReports of different men using the name range from Wakayama, Ibaraki and Mie prefectures.\n"}

The purpose of learning object metadata is to support the reusability of learning objects, to aid discoverability, and to facilitate their interoperability, usually in the context of online learning management systems (LMS).\n\nThe IEEE 1484.12.1 – 2002 Standard for Learning Object Metadata is an internationally recognised open standard (published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association, New York) for the description of “learning objects\". Relevant attributes of learning objects to be described include: type of object; author; owner; terms of distribution; format; and pedagogical attributes, such as teaching or interaction style.\n\nThe IEEE working group that developed the standard defined learning objects, \"for the purposes of the standard,\" as being \"any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training.\" This definition has struck many commentators as being rather broad in its scope, but the definition was intended to provide a broad class of objects to which LOM metadata might usefully be associated rather than to give an instructional or pedagogic definition of a learning object. \"IEEE 1484.12.1\" is the first part of a multipart standard, and describes the LOM data model. The LOM data model specifies which aspects of a learning object should be described and what vocabularies may be used for these descriptions; it also defines how this data model can be amended by additions or constraints. Other parts of the standard are being drafted to define bindings of the LOM data model, i.e. define how LOM records should be represented in XML and RDF (\"IEEE 1484.12.3\" and \"IEEE 1484.12.4\" respectively). This article focuses on the LOM data model rather than issues relating to XML or other bindings.\n\nIMS Global Learning Consortium is an international consortium that contributed to the drafting of the IEEE Learning Object Metadata (together with the ARIADNE Foundation) and endorsed early drafts of the data model as part of the IMS Learning Resource Meta-data specification (IMS LRM, versions 1.0 – 1.2.2). Feedback and suggestions from the implementers of IMS LRM fed into the further development of the LOM, resulting in some drift between version 1.2 of the IMS LRM specification and what was finally published at the LOM standard. Version 1.3 of the IMS LRM specification realigns the IMS LRM data model with the IEEE LOM data model and specifies that the IEEE XML binding should be used. Thus, we can now use the term 'LOM' in referring to both the IEEE standard and version 1.3 of the IMS specification. The IMS LRM specification also provides an extensive \"Best Practice and Implementation Guide\", and an \"XSL transform\" that can be used to migrate metadata instances from the older versions of the IMS LRM XML binding to the IEEE LOM XML binding.\n\nThe LOM comprises a hierarchy of elements. At the first level, there are nine categories, each of which contains sub-elements; these sub-elements may be simple elements that hold data, or may themselves be aggregate elements, which contain further sub-elements. The semantics of an element are determined by its context: they are affected by the parent or container element in the hierarchy and by other elements in the same container. For example, the various \"Description\" elements (1.4, 5.10, 6.3, 7.2.2, 8.3 and 9.3) each derive their context from their parent element. In addition, description element 9.3 also takes its context from the value of element 9.1 \"Purpose\" in the same instance of \"Classification\".\n\nThe data model specifies that some elements may be repeated either individually or as a group; for example, although the elements 9.2 (\"Description\") and 9.1 (\"Purpose\") can only occur once within each instance of the \"Classification\" container element, the \"Classification\" element may be repeated - thus allowing many descriptions for different purposes.\n\nThe data model also specifies the value space and datatype for each of the simple data elements. The value space defines the restrictions, if any, on the data that can be entered for that element. For many elements, the value space allows any string of Unicode character to be entered, whereas other elements entries must be drawn from a declared list (i.e. a controlled vocabulary) or must be in a specified format (e.g. date and language codes). Some element datatypes simply allow a string of characters to be entered, and others comprise two parts, as described below:\n\nWhen implementing the LOM as a data or service provider, it is not necessary to support all the elements in the data model, nor need the LOM data model limit the information which may be provided. The creation of an application profile allows a community of users to specify which elements and vocabularies they will use. Elements from the LOM may be dropped and elements from other metadata schemas may be brought in; likewise, the vocabularies in the LOM may be supplemented with values appropriate to that community.\n\nThe key requirements for exploiting the LOM as a data or service provider are to:\n\nThere are many metadata specifications; of particular interest is the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (commonly known as Simple Dublin Core, standardised as \"ANSI/NISO Z39.85 – 2001\"). Simple Dublin Core (DC) provides a non-complex, loosely defined set of elements which is useful for sharing metadata across a wide range of disparate services. Since the LOM standard used Dublin Core as a starting point, refining the Simple DC schema with qualifiers relevant to learning objects, there is some overlap between the LOM and DC standards. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is also working on a set of terms which allow the Dublin Core Element Set to be used with greater semantic precision (Qualified Dublin Core). The Dublin Education Working Group aims to provide refinements of Dublin Core for the specific needs of the education community.\n\nMany other education-related specifications allow for LO metadata to be embedded within XML instances, such as: describing the resources in an IMS Content Package or Resource List; describing the vocabularies and terms in an IMS VDEX (Vocabulary Definition and Exchange) file; and describing the question items in an IMS QTI (Question and Test Interoperability) file.\n\nThe IMS Vocabulary Definition and Exchange (VDEX) specification has a double relation with the LOM, since not only can the LOM provide metadata on the vocabularies in a VDEX instance, but VDEX can be used to describe the controlled vocabularies which are the value space for many LOM elements.\n\nLOM records can be transported between systems using a variety of protocols, perhaps the most widely used being OAI-PMH.\n\nFor UK Further and Higher Education, the most relevant family of application profiles are those based around the \"UK LOM Core\". The UK LOM Core is currently a draft schema researched by a community of practitioners to identify common UK practice in learning object content, by comparing 12 metadata schemas. UK LOM is currently legacy work, it is not in active development.\n\n\"CanCore\" provides detailed guidance for the interpretation and implementation of each data element in the LOM standard. These guidelines (2004) constitute a 250-page document, and have been developed over three years under the leadership of Norm Friesen, and through consultation with experts across Canada and throughout the world. These guidelines are also available at no charge from the CanCore Website.\n\nANZ-LOM is a metadata profile developed for the education sector in Australia and New Zealand. The profile sets obligations for elements and illustrates how to apply controlled vocabularies, including example regional vocabularies used in the \"classification\" element. The ANZ-LOM profile was first published by The Le@rning Federation (TLF) in January, 2008.\n\nThe Australian Vocational Training and Education (VET) sector uses an application profile of the IEEE LOM called Vetadata. The profile contains five mandatory elements, and makes use of a number of vocabularies specific to the Australian VET sector. This application profile was first published in 2005.

He seems to have had no literary reputation at the time, but his work throws much light on the development of popular literature and social life in London, where he spent his life. His contact with the middle and lower classes of society included working in 1600–1615 for William White, and then George Loftus, booksellers, who published Rowlands's pamphlets in this time.\n\n\nOf his later works may be mentioned \"Sir Thomas Overbury; or the Poysoned Knights Complaint, and The Melancholic Knight\" (1615), which suggests a hearing of Beaumont and Fletcher's \"Knight of the Burning Pestle\". The last of his humorous studies, \"Good Newes and Bad Newes\", appeared in 1622, and in 1628 he published a pious volume of prose and verse, entitled \"Heaven's Glory, Seeke it: Earts vanitie, Flye it: Hells Horror, Fere it\".,\n\nNothing is known of him after that. Edmund Gosse, introducing Rowlands's complete works, edited in 1872–1880 for the Hunterian Club in Glasgow by Sidney John Hervon Herttage, sums him up as a small, non-political Daniel Defoe, a pamphleteer in verse whose talents were never exercised except when their possessor was pressed for means, and a poet of considerable talent, yet without a spark or glimmer of genius.\n\nGosse's notice is reprinted in his \"Seventeenth Century Studies\" (1883). A poem by Rowlands, \"The Bride\" (1617), was reprinted at Boston, USA, in 1905 by A. C. Potter.,\n\n\n"}

It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege. Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, cynicism, and existential boredom; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, romantic intrigues and duels. He is often unmindful, indifferent or unempathetic with society's issues and can carelessly distress others with his actions, despite his position of power. He will often use his power for his own comfort and security and will have very little interest in being charitable or using it for the greater good. \n\nThe superfluous man will often attempt to manipulate, control or enslave other individuals. Because he has no integrity or ambitions, he is often self-serving and sees little point to being a benefactor or helping others. He will often carelessly try to manipulate, degrade or pacify individuals within the society; in order to gain more comfort and security.\n\nThe character type originates in Alexander Pushkin's verse-novel \"Eugene Onegin\" (1825–32). This term was popularized by Ivan Turgenev's novella \"The Diary of a Superfluous Man\" (1850) and was thereafter applied to characters from earlier novels. Mikhail Lermontov's \"A Hero of Our Time\" (1840) depicts another superfluous man – Pechorin – as its protagonist. He can be seen as a nihilist and fatalist. Later examples include Alexander Herzen's Beltov in \"Who is to Blame?\" (1845–46), Ivan Turgenev's \"Rudin\" (1856), and the title character of Ivan Goncharov's \"Oblomov\" (1859).\n\nRussian critics such as Vissarion Belinsky viewed the superfluous man as a byproduct of Nicholas I's reign, when the best educated men would not enter the discredited government service and, lacking other options for self-realization, doomed themselves to live out their life in passivity. Scholar David Patterson describes the superfluous man as \"not just...another literary type but...a paradigm of a person who has lost a point, a place, a presence in life\" before concluding that \"the superfluous man is a homeless man\".\n\nThe superfluous man is often in contrast politically with the great man.\n\n\n"}

The band sold over 100,000 copies of their self-produced \"Barí\" album, and has received several awards, among these the BBC Radio 3 World Music Award for Europe in 2004 (having also been nominated in 2003).\n\nTheir success is also notable for being achieved without the aid of label backing; they set up their own label, La Fábrica de Colores, to get complete artistic freedom for \"Barí\", away from the pressure they perceived from their record company Edel Records for their debut \"Vengue.\"\n\nFlamenco is clearly central to their sound; Ramón Giménez observed \"the magic lies in the flamenco... that is the heartbeat of Ojos de Brujo's songs.\" However, they are definitely not pure flamenco. Xavi Turull said: \"...we aren't trying to do flamenco. What we are doing is using the richness of flamenco and the richness of other music to build up something different. Maybe sometimes I would say that flamenco is the strongest ingredient, but we aren't trying to do flamenco.\" Upon the release of their first album, Vengue (1999), the flamenco fusion group did receive a lot of skepticism and criticism from the flamenco purists. Many of them refused to acknowledge that the music was true flamenco and that it strayed from its foundation, style and structure. However, according to the group, their music reflects the past of flamenco and its multicultural roots. The gypsies themselves are diverse and multicultural, a people from the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Iberia. Ojos de Brujos takes this same theme and blends flamenco music with the diverse musical genres of today like hip hop and pop to modernize flamenco. For example Flamenco is combined in their music with other influences including Afro-Cuban, the rap and scratching/turntablism of Hip Hop, and Indian music. The music of Ojos de Brujo uses the drama of flamenco, but carries it along on a steady rhythmic foundation, making the group's music a closer relative to rumba catalana. Usually the focus of Ojos' songs are the vocals by Marina \"La Canillas\" Abad, which move smoothly from gritty flamenco wail to authoritative rapping. The blend of music opens up their audience base and provides more opportunity to keep creating new types of sounds.\n\nOjos de Brujo also appeals to the youth by addressing social issues and concerns within their music. The group name, Eyes of the Sorcerer reflects this theme. According to group members, the eyes of the sorcerer look deeper into the issues and reveal the truth. Many people think that the band is named Eyes of the Witch. However, Brujo is masculine; Bruja is the Spanish for witch. Moreover, none of their songs address politics; instead many reveal current social situations in Spain. One of their songs, “Nada en la nevera” (2001), “Nothing in the Fridge,” Ojos de Brujos highlights poverty, not only in Spain but throughout the world by singing about someone who wakes up every morning to find nothing in the refrigerator. Criticizing society, in the song “Naita” the singer says, “La sangre se me rebela cuando me pongo a pensar que aquí unos tienen de tó y que otros no tienen de ná” or “My blood boils when I think that there are some who have everything and others who have nothing”. Mixing “dub, hip hop, and flamenco, just to name a few, allows Ojos de Brujo a wide range of expression. By blending flamenco and rumba, grabbing handfuls of hip hop, dub and modern-sounding drum licks and bass lines the group makes forward-looking music that could definitely have been made only in Spain and probably only in Barcelona.” Creating variety in beats, lyrics, and instruments only enhances their social and cultural message and reflects the modern and highly globalized society in which they perform.\n\n\nTheir CDs have also featured guest appearances by a large number of other musicians, including Nitin Sawhney and Prithpal Rajput from Asian Dub Foundation as well as many Spanish artists.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife Uliana of Tver.\n\nAfter Algirdas' death in 1377, Jogaila became the Grand Duke. It is believed that the dynastic disputes that soon erupted between him and his uncle Kęstutis and his cousin Vytautas the Great were largely inspired by Skirgaila. It is known about his travels to the Teutonic Knights in 1379 just a year prior to the controversial Treaty of Dovydiškės. Skirgaila was the chief supporter of his brother Jogaila and helped him to imprison both Kęstutis and Vytautas in Kreva castle during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384). Some historians speculate that Kęstutis' death after a week in prison was in fact assassination carried out by Skirgaila. As a reward for a job well done, Skirgaila received the Duchy of Trakai.\n\nWhen Jogaila was preparing for the Union of Kreva, Skirgaila was actively involved in the negotiations and even headed a diplomatic mission to Poland. The negotiations succeeded and Jogaila married Jadwiga of Poland and was crowned as King of Poland in 1386. He appointed Skirgaila on 13 March 1386 as governor in Lithuania, not only on his behalf but also on behalf of queen Jadwiga and Polish Crown. \n\nAs ruler of Lithuania, Skirgaila had to deal with his oldest brother Andrei, who still was refusing to accept Jogaila as a Grand Duke. First he defeated Andrei's ally Sviatoslav II of Smolensk in a battle of the Vikhra River near Mstislavl on 29 April 1386, during which Sviatoslav lost his life. Sviatoslav son Yury of Smolensk was forced to accept Lithuanian suzerainty in exchange of princely throne. Later Skirgaila attacked Polatsk; his first expedition in October was unsuccessful, but the next on March 1387 resulted in Andrei's capture and death of his son Simeon, who was killed in a battle. Next month Skirgaila was invested in Polatsk and once again pledged his loyalty to Jogaila, Jadwiga and Polish Crown, promising return of his land in case of his heirless death. Skirgaila was now directly ruling over large portion of Lithuania, including duchy of Vilnius, ruled on behalf of Jogaila. February 20th 1387 Jogaila elevated his brother above other Lithuanian princes and extended his authority over Ruthenian lands.\n\nIn 1389 he started a new civil war, but after an unsuccessful attack on Vilnius he had to seek help from the Teutonic Knights. In 1392 Jogaila and Vytautas signed the Ostrów Agreement, and Vytautas became his regent of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Duchy of Trakai was returned to Vytautas as his patrimony.\n\nAs a compensation Skirgaila received a portion of Volhynia and Kiev since 1395. The circumstances surrounding his death are not entirely clear. He was interred in Kiev Pechersk Lavra.\n\n"}

His father was from among the German nobility, polonised in the 18th century and a distant relative of General Stanisław Fiszer, while his mother was a member of the Polish gentry and owner of the said manor and village. Very little is known of Fiszer's childhood apart from the fact that he was a late child (both of his parents being over 40 at his birth) and that he became an orphan relatively soon. \n\nIn the 1880s Fiszer moved to Warsaw, where he started spending most of his time in Warsaw's cafes, restaurants and some of the most notable clubs of the era. With time, he became a characteristic part of the Warsaw's social panorama and became friends with most of the contemporary Polish writers, poets, artists and politicians. Renowned for his existential monologues and anecdotes, Fiszer's only pastime was the restaurants. In the interbellum, Fiszer became one of the most notable members of Warsaw's high society. Frequent guest at balls and parties, he became a living legend. His family village became neglected and soon had to be parcellated for debts. However, Fiszer's lifestyle did not suffer, as he barely ever had to pay for his meals, since he was seen by the gastronomers as an advertisement for their restaurants. That is why he often was a guest of \"Udziałowa\", \"Ziemiańska\", \"IPS\", Oaza, Astoria or \"Blikle\". \n\nAmong the closest friends of Franc Fiszer were Bolesław Leśmian (Fiszer is said to have invented his pen-name), Stefan Żeromski, Władysław Reymont, the \"Skamandrites\" Antoni Słonimski and Julian Tuwim, Jan Lechoń, Miriam, Artur Rubinstein and Antoni Lange. Although Fiszer never published any book himself, he is mentioned in nearly all memoirs by Warsaw's artists of the inter-war period. Also, he became the only person never to publish a book to be mentioned in both Stanisław Tatarkiewicz's \"Polish Biographical Dictionary\" and Leszek Kołakowski's \"Philosophy in Poland; Dictionary of Writers\". \n\nIn 1985, most of the memoirs mentioning Franciszek Fiszer were collected by Roman Loth in a book titled \"Na rogu świata i nieskończoności\" (\"At the Crossing of World and Infinity\").\n\n"}

{"id": "1955529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955529", "title": "Arlington Memorial Amphitheater", "text": "Arlington Memorial Amphitheater\n\nMemorial Amphitheater is an outdoor amphitheater, exhibit hall, and nonsectarian chapel located in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States. Designed in 1913 as a replacement for the older, wooden amphitheater near Arlington House, ground was broken for its construction in March 1915 and it was dedicated in May 1920. In the center of its eastern steps is the Tomb of the Unknowns, dedicated in 1921. It has served as the site for numerous Veterans Day and Memorial Day services, as well as for memorial services and funerals for many individuals.\n\nArlington National Cemetery was established in 1864. Due to the growing importance of the cemetery as well as the much larger crowds attending Memorial Day observances, Brigadier General Montgomery C. Meigs (who was Quartermaster General of the United States Army) decided a formal meeting space at the cemetery was needed. A grove of close-growing trees just southwest of Arlington House Grove was cut down and a wooden amphitheater (today known as the Tanner Amphitheater) constructed in 1873.\n\nBy the early years of the 1900s, however, the Old Amphitheater had grown far too small for the large ceremonies which were held there. Judge Ivory Kimball, Commander of the Department of the Potomac chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic (or GAR, a veterans' group for those who fought for the Union in the Civil War), believed that not only should a new and larger facility be built, but also that the new amphitheater represent the dead of all wars in which the nation had fought. Kimball and the GAR began their push for a new amphitheater in 1903, and sketches for the amphitheater drawn up by Frederick D. Owen, a civilian engineer working for the United States Army Corps of Engineers. But legislation failed to pass Congress in 1905, 1907, and 1908. Legislation passed in 1908 authorizing the establishment of a memorial commission, but it received only $5,000 in funding. Legislation was introduced again in 1912 by Senator George Sutherland. Sutherland's bill proposed construction of a 5,000-seat amphitheater with an underground crypt (for the burial of famous individuals) to cost no more than $750,000. Prospects for passage initially seemed dim. But during the third session of the 62nd Congress, a number of new federal memorials were approved, including the Arlington Memorial Bridge, the Lincoln Memorial, a memorial to women who served in the Civil War (now the American Red Cross National Headquarters), and a George Washington memorial auditorium. The successful push for new memorials helped supporters win the passage of legislation authorizing construction of Memorial Amphitheater. President William Howard Taft, in one of his last acts as president, signed the legislation into law on March 4, 1913.\nThe 1908 authorizing legislation established an Arlington Memorial Amphitheater Commission (AMAC) to oversee the design and construction of the structure. Its members included the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Superintendent of the U.S. Capitol, Judge Kimball (as a representative of the GAR), and Charles W. Newton (as a representative of the United Spanish War Veterans, a Spanish–American War veterans group).\n\nIt immediately became apparent, however, that although Congress had authorized the expenditure of $250,000 for Memorial Amphitheater, it had not actually appropriated any such funds from the U.S. Treasury. This left the AMAC without any funds to conduct its business. It was not until August 1, 1914, that Congress finally appropriated money for the amphitheater's construction. Ten days later, Colonel William W. Harts of the United States Army Corps of Engineers was elected the commission's executive director. On October 12, 1914, the AMAC contracted with the New York-based architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings to design the building. The AMAC hired the George A. Fuller Co. to construct it on February 11, 1915.\n\nThere is some disagreement among sources as to who should receive the majority of credit for designing Memorial Amphitheater. Lemos, Morrison, Warren, and Hewitt specifically name Thomas Hastings, as does the United States Commission of Fine Arts and others. But other sources name Frederick D. Owen, a civilian engineer working for the Corps of Engineers (and who also designed the Flag of the President of the United States). Owen is named by architectural historians Butler and Wilson and by historian Rick Atkinson. The Arlington Memorial Amphitheater Commission is not clear as to who deserves the credit, as it notes that Owen \"drew the first sketches for plans for the great Memorial in 1904\" and later gave \"suggestions and advice as to the form of the Memorial\". Owen's significant role is made clear by the AMAC in other ways as well: He designed the memorial trowel used by President Woodrow Wilson to lay the cornerstone; he served on the reception committee for the cornerstone laying ceremony; he co-chaired the planning committee for the 1921 dedication; and he chaired the reception committee for the dedication. But the AMAC also said Carrère and Hastings prepared the plans for the building, provided the explanation of the design to the AMAC, and was named by Congress as the architects.\n\nThe AMAC's composition changed somewhat after Congress amended the commission's authorizing legislation on March 3, 1915. Congress added the leader of Camp 171, United Confederate Veterans of the District of Columbia, to the commission as a full voting member.\n\nThe site chosen for the new Memorial Amphitheater was the top of a hill about south of Arlington House. A gravel pit, opened in the mid-1800s, existed there previously.\n\nGround for Memorial Amphitheater was broken on March 1, 1915. President Woodrow Wilson laid its cornerstone in a ceremony on October 13, 1915. A copper box placed in a hollowed out section of the cornerstone contained a copy of the United States Constitution, a copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, the Bible, the flag of the United States, one each of every coin and postage stamp then in circulation, a Congressional directory, a telephone directory of the District of Columbia, an autographed photograph of President Wilson, and several items connected with Arlington National Cemetery. Kimball participated in the ground-breaking and cornerstone ceremonies, but did not live to see the amphitheater completed: He died on May 15, 1916.\n\nExcavation of the foundation was complete by the end of June 1915. Concrete foundations had also been laid and cured, and most of the brick foundation was in place as well. Most of the amphitheater's foundation was complete by June 30, 1916. The foundation included 629,000 bricks, of structural steel, and of marble (for the exterior of the structure). The Guastavino tile system, patented in 1885, was used to create arches and vaults in the basement. More than of this tile were used. The heating, clean water, and sewage systems were also complete. The Corps of Engineers also finished the architectural drawings for the approaches around the amphitheater as well, and was ready to start work on them.\n\nA major design changed also occurred in June 1915. Originally, plans for the amphitheater called for wooden balustrades, plaster moldings, cement floors and ceilings, and wooden doors. But on June 26, all of these materials were changed to marble. The total cost of the changes was $41,000.\n\nWork on the amphitheater slowed in mid-1916 and throughout 1917 due to a lack of high quality marble available for the work. Severe winter weather also meant that work on the approaches did not begin until late June 1917. The amphitheater was supposed to have neared completion on February 15, 1917, but these lengthy delays meant that the construction schedule was extended for a full year. The amphitheater was also proving to be much more costly than expected. Bids from contractors were all far above what the Corps of Engineers expected, but work went ahead anyway. By June 30, 1917, much of the amphitheater and its colonnade were done. Another of marble had been placed for the columns, and of concrete and of structural steel were used to support them. Skylights and ornamental ironwork stairs were in place, and ornamental plastering and marble carving had begun.\nThe amphitheater, chapel, and most of the entrance hall were finished in 1918. The entrance hall was built with red brick (257,100 of them), and clad in of marble. Another in of marble were used for interior columns. The extent to which marble was used was eye-opening: for flooring, for stairs, for door and window frames, and of moldings. The eastern steps consumed of concrete. The interior was decorated with ornamental plaster, terra cotta partitions, terrazzo flooring, bronze doors and grillwork, ornamental ironwork railings and stairs, and glazed tile. While more than $7,000 ($161,500 in 2013 inflation-adjusted U.S. dollars) was spent on carving for the amphitheater, just $2,933 was spent for carving on the inside and outside of the entrance hall.\n\nThe advent of World War I had a significant impact on the construction of Memorial Amphitheater. The United States entered the war in April 1917, and by spring 1918 American troops were arriving in Europe. Most skilled workers were diverted to the war effort, although artisans (such as marble carvers) were still available. The Corps of Engineers was able to obtain, after lengthy delays, the high-quality marble it needed for the approaches from the island of Vinalhaven, Maine. But railroads and cargo ships were so congested carrying war materiél and military personnel that the marble could not be transported to Arlington National Cemetery until late 1917. By then, another severe winter had set in. Intensely cold weather continued into the late spring, further delaying work. Only a limited amount of work on the approaches had concluded by the end of June 1918. Some modifications were also made to the structure because of the war. The largest of these changes eliminated the seating planned for the top of the colonnade.\n\nBy June 1918, nearly all of Memorial Amphitheater's exterior was complete. The interior work on the chapel and the first-floor reception hall was also done, leaving only the basement-level kitchen storage areas and the second-floor offices to be worked on. Construction of the concrete floor of the amphitheater also was under way.\nInterior work on Memorial Amphitheater ended in June 1919. The remainder of the basement rooms and all of the second floor were now finished, too. All that remained to be done was decoration of the chapel ceiling, some interior and exterior inscriptions, and installation of lighting fixtures. The Corps of Engineers was also ready to connect the water and sewer lines, grade the grounds and roads, and install plantings and sod. During the next nine months, these items were all finished, and the interior painted. The masonry approaches were also completed, and the roadways and sidewalks paved. The G.B. Mullin Co. did the landscape design and work, which involved replanting 20 cedar trees around the three amphitheater entrances. The total cost of the structure and its grounds was $810,812. In total, of Mountain White marble from the Danby quarries of Vermont were used in its construction.\n\nMemorial Amphitheater was dedicated on May 15, 1920. The Corps of Engineers turned it over to the Quartermaster General's office on July 1.\n\nMemorial Amphitheater was designed by Thomas Hastings to be the center of a biaxial grouping of landscape features and monuments that included the \"USS Maine\" Mast Memorial in the west, the Spanish–American War Memorial to the south, and a formal Italianate garden to the east. Greek Revival, Romanesque Revival, and Renaissance decorative elements are used throughout the structure. Ulysses Ricci designed the various friezes, ornamental devices, and decorative elements of the amphitheater and entrance hall. Hastings said he wanted Memorial Amphitheater to be the building he was most remembered by.\n\nAs constructed, Memorial Amphitheater consisted of an elliptical outdoor amphitheater that sat 4,000. The bays formed by the colonnade can seat another 150 individuals. Another 1,000 individuals may be accommodated by standing.\n\nThe amphitheater is surrounded by a colonnade, with main entrances at the east and west axes. The capitals of the columns are Doric, but rest on an Attic base. The entablature above the columns, however, is Ionic to allow for inscriptions. These inscriptions, on the exterior of the entablature, list 44 major battles from the American Revolutionary War through the Spanish–American War. Low, backless marble benches in concentric circles face the semi-circular main stage, which has three levels. The lowest level features a klismos, a form of ancient Greek informal chair meant for rulers. The klismos chair faces the audience, much as a cathedra (or bishop's chair) does. Hastings intended the klismos chair to remind the audience of the missing heroes honored by the amphitheater. The second level of the stage has a podium. The stage and amphitheater are designed so that any speaker must look down at the klismos chair while addressing the audience, and must look at the \"USS Maine\" Mast Memorial if looking up. The third and uppermost level of the stage contains a semi-circular seating area for about 100 people and an apse in the back. The interior dome of the apse is richly carved, and the square pilasters on either side of the stage list the names of famous American generals (left, as you face the stage) and admirals (right) from the American Revolutionary War through the Spanish–American War. A quote from General George Washington's June 26, 1775, letter to the Continental Congress is inscribed inside the apse: \"When we assumed the soldier we did not lay aside the citizen.\" A quote from President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is inscribed above the stage: \"We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.\" Decorative tall urns carved with eagles, rams' heads, and snakes were placed on pedestals in niches on either side of the stage.\nAbove the west entrance of the amphitheater is a quote from the Roman poet Horace: \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\" (\"It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country\"). Under the colonnade are 300 crypts, which were intended for the burial of important people.\n\nIn the basement (or ground floor, if approached from the west) beneath the amphitheater stage is a chapel. This domed structure was designed to seat 150, and has a raised ambulatory around the edges.\n\nAs originally designed, the main entrance was in the east through the doors of the cruciform entrance hall. The entrance hall is fronted by a six-columned portico with Corinthian capitals. A frieze above the main bronze doors depicts symbolic trophies of war. The entrance hall is not connected internally with the amphitheater. Stairways, bridges, and short corridors on the outside of the entrance hall provide access to the stage in the amphitheater. The main floor of the reception hall is clad in Botticino marble. The main floor originally housed a reception hall (with two side galleries for the display of battle flags and war trophies) and stage, and the second floor housed a museum. In 1929, the main floor became a Memorial Exhibit Hall displaying honors received by the unknown soldiers lying beneath the Tomb of the Unknowns, and the second floor became offices.\n\nSteps lead from the main doors of the entrance hall down to a small plaza. Hastings designed a series of short steps to lead from the plaza down to a landing, and then a series of monumental steps to lead from the landing to the eastern formal garden below. In the center of the short steps was a pedestal for a statue. No artwork was ever placed there. This pedestal was later removed, and the Tomb of the Unknowns took its place in 1921. The planned monumental steps leading down to the formal garden were not built when Memorial Amphitheater was dedicated. A retaining wall with false arches was constructed instead.\n\nA roadway was designed to cross the plaza and circle the entire structure.\n\nOn March 4, 1921, the Congress approved the construction of a memorial to an unidentified American serviceman from World War I to be placed in the stairs leading up from the east landing to the plaza in front of Memorial Amphitheater. An unknown soldier was identified and brought back from France, and interred inside a small marble tomb on Armistice Day on November 11, 1921. To construct the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (as it was then informally called), the pedestal for the memorial statue envisioned in Hastings' design was removed. Workers dug down into the earth behind the retaining wall. At this level, concrete footings long by wide were constructed. The earthen walls were reinforced with a burial vault consisting of concrete walls thick at the bottom, narrowing to just thick at the top. A hollow rectangular plinth was constructed on top of the vault walls, above which was a slightly smaller hollow marble base. On top of the marble base was a rectangular capstone with curved sides, which was also pierced through the center. A deep layer of soil brought from France along with the unknown soldier's body lined the bottom of the burial vault. After the unknown soldier was lowered into the vault and rested on the soil below, the capstone was sealed with a marble lid.\n\nAdditional changes to the east front came within just a few years. On July 3, 1926, Congress authorized the completion of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with an appropriate memorial. A design by architect Lorimer Rich and sculptor Thomas Hudson Jones was selected on December 10, 1928. The Lorimer/Hudson design, like nearly all the other submissions, anticipated removing the retaining wall below the tomb and building the monumental staircase first envisioned by Thomas Hastings. Congress agreed with this revision, and on February 28, 1929, authorized construction of the stairs, new road and pedestrian approaches, alterations to the formal gardens, and a new overlook. The Construction Division of the Quartermaster General's office oversaw the work, which was performed by the Hegman-Harris Company of New York City.\n\nLittle additional work was done at Memorial Amphitheater until 1954. By then, settling of the amphitheater and entrance hall, cracking of walls and exterior marble, water damage, and other serious problems were beginning to affect the structure. Congress appropriated $15,000 for fiscal 1954 (which began June 30, 1953) for a year-long study of the problems. A preliminary estimate indicated that repairs would cost $179,000. But the finished study identified even more serious issues, almost all of which were caused by design deficiencies which did not take into account the seasonal expansion and contraction of the building's marble. Arlington National Cemetery officials were forced to ask Congress for $447,000 to repair the amphitheater and $179,000 to repair the entrance building. Congress approved the request.\n\nA second major change was made to the plaza in 1958. President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in August 1956 to allow the interment of unidentified remains for soldiers from World War II and the Korean War at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Two new burial vaults, to the northwest and southwest, were dug in the plaza before the eastern entrance hall. Carved into the granite in front of the tomb sarcophagus were the dates \"1917-1918\". The Korean War unknown was interred in the northwest vault beneath a slab with the dates \"1950-1953\" carved into its western edge. The World War II unknown was interred in the southwest vault beneath a slab with the dates \"1941-1945\" carved into its western edge. The cover slabs of both new vaults were flush with the plaza. The two unknowns were interred on Memorial Day on May 30, 1958.\n\nIn August, 1960, Congress abolished the Arlington Memorial Amphitheater Commission and transferred its duties to the Secretary of Defense. Although the commission had long ago fulfilled its basic mission of the construction of Memorial Amphitheater, it still had the legal authority to approve the placement of plaques, markers, and other commemorations on the inside, on the exterior, or on the grounds of the structure.\n\nOn May 24, 1964, Memorial Amphitheater was the site of a late-afternoon ceremony celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of Arlington National Cemetery. During its 50th year anniversary in 1969, the American Legion, along with the American Legion Auxiliary donated an exterior lighting system so that Memorial Amphitheater and the Tomb of the Unknowns could remain lit at night. In the midst of ceremonies also marking the 50th anniversary of the Paris Caucus – President Richard Nixon formally took possession of the lighting system in the nation’s name, flipping the switch that turned the lights on.\n\nAdditional physical plant problems appeared at Memorial Amphitheater in 1965. The retaining walls adjacent to the east plaza began cracking vertically, and extensive horizontal cracks and spalling were found on the Tomb of the Unknowns as well. Additional damage occurred over the next five years. Congress then appropriated $522,000 in fiscal year 1972 to repair these problems as well as provide yet another renovation of the exhibit hall. By this time, attendance at Arlington National Cemetery had soared with the construction of the John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame in 1967 and the addition of the grave of Robert F. Kennedy in 1971. To accommodate the much larger crowds wishing to see the Tomb of the Unknowns, Congress appropriated an additional $478,000 in fiscal 1972 to widen pedestrian walkway approaches to accommodate the larger crowds. To make Memorial Amphitheater more accessible for the disabled, steep slopes around the structure were eliminated and steps were replaced with ramps. Congress appropriated an additional $3 million in 1974, to bring the construction project's total to $4 million. The extra funds paid for widening of the steps and portico in front of the east entrance — increasing the number of people who could view the changing of the guard at the tomb to 800 individuals from 200. In addition, the tomb honor guard received new guard posts on the plaza in front of the amphitheater.\n\nThe mid-1970s widening of the Memorial Amphitheater portico, reconstruction of the pedestrian approaches, and repairs to the plaza around the Tomb of the Unknowns represented the first major construction at the site since 1920.\n\nAn attempt to dedicate the chapel at Memorial Amphitheater occurred in 1977. The National Cemetery Act of 1973 required the Secretary of Defense to locate unidentified remains of a Vietnam War veteran, construct a vault for these remains at the Tomb of the Unknowns, and inter the remains there. The vault was constructed between the World War II and Korean War vaults on the plaza, and a marble slab with the word \"VIETNAM\" inscribed on it placed over the empty burial shaft. By 1977, many remains had been located, but all of them were subsequently identified. Vietnam veterans and their supporters, concerned that no unidentified remains would ever be located, pushed to have the chapel in Memorial Amphitheater dedicated to veterans who served in Southeast Asia from 1958 to 1975. Legislation to require the change was introduced in Congress, but most legislators felt that if the chapel were to be dedicated it should be to all veterans. The legislation did not pass, and the chapel remained nameless.\n\nOn Veterans Day in 1978, President Jimmy Carter dedicated a plaque inside the exhibit hall which honored Vietnam War veterans. Two temporary plaques in the exhibit hall were dedicated by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger on Memorial Day in 1983. One plaque commemorated military personnel who died in the Vietnam War, and the second explained why no Vietnam War unknown had been interred at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n\nExtensive additional renovations in the amphitheater were made in the mid-1990s. Congress appropriated $4.82 million in fiscal 1992 to repair rainwater damage and fix leaks, and an additional $4.5 million in fiscal 1993 to restore damaged marble. Although the project was planned for completion in July 1995, a six-month delay occurred because of protests regarding the way the contracts were awarded. Bids for the project came in much lower than anticipated, creating $2.7 million in savings. The Army used $34,405 to make whole the bidder who had protested the improper contract award. About $1.4 million of these savings were used to build new wheelchair access ramps and improve access to the amphitheater for handicapped or disabled individuals. The remaining $1.3 million were used to build a columbarium at the cemetery. The repairs included installation of new waterproof membranes; removing water and rust stains; patching and repainting cement, marble, and stone; replacement of all deteriorated marble sculptures, balusters, and benches; replacement of worn and rusted iron railings and drinking fountains; replacement of worn and broken flagstone walkways; and installation of new and upgraded signage and trash containers. These repairs and improvements were almost complete by the end of March 1996.\n\nClark Construction Group, which was the general contractor for these renovations, received an Excellence in Construction Award from the D.C./Virginia chapter of the Associated Builders and Contractors for the outstanding quality of its work.\n\nControversy about the renovation erupted in January 2011, however, when original decorative urns from the 1995–1996 renovation turned up at auction. The two tall urns, sculpted by Ulysses Ricci, formerly stood on either side of the stage in the amphitheater. By 1995, they had significantly weathered and many details had softened so much as to be unrecognizable. Omni Construction, one of Clark Construction's subcontractors, was assigned to dispose of the urns. Omni turned the urns over to Pagliaro Brothers Stone of Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Pagliaro Brothers Stone said they did not have records about the urns' ultimate fate, but in 1997 the urns ended up in the hands of an unidentified antiques dealer. The dealer sold them to DHS Designs, an antique shop in Queenstown, Maryland. The urns (priced at $125,000) never sold, and in 2010 the owner of DHS Designs closed his store and put the urns up for auction. Potomack Company, the Alexandria, Virginia, auction house assigned to handle the urns, advertised them in December 2010—which brought the urns to the attention of preservationists in the D.C. area. According to unnamed preservationist experts interviewed by \"The Washington Post\", the historic urns should have been restored or placed in a museum—not donated to private owners for sale. The U.S. Army, which manages Arlington National Cemetery, said it could not find the 1995 renovation contract and was unable to say what provisions for the urns' disposal had been made nor whether federal property and preservation agencies had been consulted before the urns were replaced.\n\nWithin a week of press reports about the sale, Arlington National Cemetery officials said that Clark Construction had been instructed to preserve the urns. These instructions met the requirements of Virginia law, which forbade the discard of historic artifacts. Alerted to the sale by \"The Washington Post\", the Army asked Potomack Company to postpone the sale pending investigation of ownership.\n\nOn January 24, 2011, DHS Designs returned the urns at no cost to Arlington National Cemetery. The Army did not say whether it would display the urns at the cemetery or move them to another Army museum.\n\nIn 1999, moisture damage to the ceiling in the Memorial Amphitheater chapel wore away a hole, which allowed water to begin dripping into the chapel.\n\nThe plaza of Memorial Amphitheater was altered once more in 1999. The unidentified remains of a Vietnam War servicemember were interred in the Vietnam War vault at the Tomb of the Unknowns on May 28, 1984. But questions were raised in 1994 that indicated the Army (under pressure from the Reagan administration to placate veterans' groups by finding a Vietnam War unknown) ignored evidence that the remains could be identified. After extensive media attention, the Vietnam War unknown was exhumed from the Tomb of the Unknowns on May 14, 1998. DNA testing revealed on June 30, 1998, that the remains were those of United States Air Force 1st Lieutenant Michael Blassie. On September 16, 1999, the marble slab over the now-empty burial vault was replaced by a new slab in a ceremony overseen by Secretary of Defense William Cohen. The new slab was inscribed with the words \"Honoring and Keeping Faith with America's Missing Servicemen.\" Department of Defense officials decided to replace the old slab with a new one given how unlikely it was that unidentified Vietnam War remains would ever be found. Covering the vault to make it appear as if it did not exist was rejected.\n\nBy 2000, the east entrance hall at Memorial Amphitheater was suffering water damage and other problems yet again. Congress appropriated $800,000 in fiscal year 2001 to identify what fixes might be needed. Repairs were made in 2006, which included ameliorating water damage in the basement, first floor, and second floor; repairing and improving roof and exterior drainage; and installing new waterproofing and drains to prevent flooding in the basement women's restroom and chapel.\n\nAdditional repairs to the walkways around Memorial Amphitheater were made in 2012. In the wake of the Arlington National Cemetery mismanagement controversy of 2008-2011, Arlington National Cemetery officials discovered that more than $32.6 million in funds for cemetery improvements, maintenance, and operations had gone unspent. A portion of these funds were used to replace approximately of the flagstone walkway around Memorial Amphitheater and to replace fire alarm systems in the east entrance hall.\n\nMemorial Amphitheater has been the site of numerous Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies. Every American President except Woodrow Wilson has visited the building since it was dedicated in 1921. Although the structure was dedicated during Wilson's presidency, he never visited Memorial Amphitheater or the Tomb of the Unknowns due to a massive stroke on October 2, 1919, from which he never recovered. He died on February 3, 1924. President Warren G. Harding was the first sitting president to visit Memorial Amphitheater, which he did on Memorial Day on May 30, 1921. President Harding was the first President to visit the Tomb of the Unknowns, as he was present during its dedication in November 1921. Harding was also the first president to speak in the Memorial Amphitheater before laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns, which he did on Memorial Day on May 30, 1923. Harding attended a service in the amphitheater on Memorial Day in May 1922, but did not speak or lay a wreath. He laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns on Veterans Day in November 1922, but did not speak in the amphitheater. On June 1, 1923, Colonel Charles Young (United States Army), The United States Military's first African American Colonel, became the fourth soldier honored with a funeral service at Arlington Memorial Amphitheater. He had died the previous year with serving as an attaché in Africa.\n\nWhile memorial services in Memorial Amphitheater are common, the amphitheater has also hosted the funerals of many famous Americans. The first funeral to be held in the amphitheater was that of sculptor Moses Jacob Ezekiel, creator of the Confederate Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, on March 30, 1921. Other funerals held in the amphitheater since then include those of General of the Armies John J. \"Black Jack\" Pershing, General of the Air Force Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, and Antarctic explorer and Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd. A funeral service for the unidentified remains of 30 victims of the September 11 attacks on The Pentagon was held at Memorial Amphitheater in 2002. It was the first time the amphitheater had held such a service since the interment of an unknown member of the armed forces representing Vietnam War dead in 1984.\n\nFrank Buckles, the last American veteran of World War I, lay in state in the Memorial Amphitheater Chapel in 2011.\n\nAn Easter sunrise service has been held at Memorial Amphitheater every year since 1931. The first such service was held in 1931 and organized by the Knights Templar, a group of Freemasons. Music was provided by the United States Marine Band. President Herbert Hoover attended the service, along with several thousand people. Along with Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies, it is one of the annual and most well-attended events in the amphitheater.\n\n\n\n"}

A variant based on the reformed Russian civil script, first introduced in the late 18th century, became widespread in Bessarabia after its annexation to the Russian Empire, while the rest of the Moldavian Principality gradually switched to a Latin-based alphabet, adopted in official after its union with Wallachia resulted in the creation of Romania. The Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet was introduced in the early 1920s, in the Soviet bid to standardise the orthography of Moldovan/Romanian in the Moldavian ASSR, at the same time furthering political objectives by marking a clear distinction from the \"bourgeois\" Latin-based Romanian orthography introduced in Romania in the 1860s. As was the case with other Cyrillic-based languages in the Soviet Union, such as Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian, obsolete and redundant characters were dropped in an effort to simplify orthography and boost literacy. It was abandoned for a Latin-based alphabet during the Union-wide Latinisation campaign in 1932. Its re-introduction was decided by the Central Executive Committee of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on May 19, 1938, albeit with an orthography more similar to standard Russian. Following the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, it was established as the official alphabet of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic until 1989, when a law returned to the standard, Latin-based, Romanian alphabet.\n\nThere were several requests to switch back to the Latin alphabet, which was seen \"more suitable for the Romance core of the language,\" in the Moldovan SSR. In 1965, the demands of the 3rd Congress of Writers of Soviet Moldavia were rejected by the leadership of the Communist Party, the replacement being deemed \"contrary to the interests of the Moldavian people and not reflecting its aspirations and hopes\".\n\nThe Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet is still the official and the only accepted alphabet in Transnistria for this language.\n\nAll but one of the letters of this alphabet can be found in the modern Russian alphabet, the exception being the character zhe (ж) with breve: Ӂ ӂ (U+04C1, U+04C2).\n\nThe following chart shows the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet compared with the Latin alphabet currently in use.

The island municipality existed from 1886 until its dissolution in 1964. It was located in the western part of the present-day Karlsøy Municipality. The municipality included the islands of Helgøya, Grøtøya, and Nordkvaløya, large parts of the nearby islands of Rebbenesøya, Ringvassøya, Vannøya, and many smaller surrounding islands. The administrative centre was located on the south side of the island of Helgøya in a small village where Helgøy Church is also located.\n\nThe municipality is named after the island of \"Helgøya\" (Old Norse: \"Helgøy\"). The name means \"den hellige øy\" or \"the holy island\" since the first element \"helgi\" means \"sanctuary\" or \"holy\" and the second part \"øy\" is identical for the word \"island\". Historically, the municipal name was spelled \"Helgø\" (before about 1919), but since that time the name has had a \"y\" at the end.\n\nFrom ancient times, a Helgøy parish has existed. In 1838, municipal self-government was introduced in Norway (see formannskapsdistrikt), and the Helgøy parish was made a part of Karlsøy Municipality. Helgøy grew as a trading post under Christian Figenschou, but residents soon became dissatisfied with the municipal government based in Karlsøy.\n\nThe municipality of Helgøy was established on 1 September 1886 when the western part of the old Karlsøy Municipality was separated to form a municipality of its own. Helgøy Municipality had an initial population of 828. Despite being separated, the two municipalities still had a common priest, sheriff, and doctor, but all these were residents in Karlsøy. From 1886 to 1892, Christian Figenschou was the mayor of Helgøy. After 1886, residents began developing a local town center on Helgøya island, with Helgøy Church, a rectory, a farm, and flourishing trade. A small village grew up around the church site and a permanent school in the parish was added on Helgøya island. Steam ships regularly stopped here and a post office was established. After 1928, a doctor and sheriff were permanently located here.\n\nDuring the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, a merger took place between the municipality of Helgøy and most of Karlsøy Municipality (except the mainland areas which became part of Lyngen Municipality). Prior to the merger, Helgøy had a population of 1,495.\n\nThe municipal council of Helgøy was made up of 15 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

Since the sample does not include all members of the population, statistics on the sample, such as means and quartiles, generally differ from the characteristics of the entire population, which are known as parameters. For example, if one measures the height of a thousand individuals from a country of one million, the average height of the thousand is typically not the same as the average height of all one million people in the country. Since sampling is typically done to determine the characteristics of a whole population, the difference between the sample and population values is considered an error. Exact measurement of sampling error is generally not feasible since the true population values are unknown.\n\nIn statistics, sampling error is the error caused by observing a sample instead of the whole population. The sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter and the actual but unknown value of the parameter.\nAn \"estimate of a quantity\" of interest, such as an average or percentage, will generally be subject to sample-to-sample variation. These variations in the possible sample values of a statistic can theoretically be expressed as sampling errors, although in practice the exact sampling error is typically unknown. Sampling error also refers more broadly to this phenomenon of random sampling variation.\n\nRandom sampling, and its derived terms such as sampling error, simply specific procedures for gathering and analyzing data that are rigorously applied as a method for arriving at results considered representative of a given population as a whole. Despite a common misunderstanding, \"random\" does not mean the same thing as \"chance\" as this idea is often used in describing situations of uncertainty, nor is it the same as projections based on an assessed probability or frequency. Sampling always refers to a procedure of gathering data from a small aggregation of individuals that is purportedly representative of a larger grouping which must in principle be capable of being measured as a totality. Random sampling is used precisely to ensure a truly representative sample from which to draw conclusions, in which the same results would be arrived at if one had included the entirety of the population instead. Random sampling (and sampling error) can only be used to gather information about a single defined point in time. If additional data is gathered (other things remaining constant) then comparison across time periods may be possible. However, this comparison is distinct from any sampling itself. As a method for gathering data within the field of statistics, random sampling is recognized as clearly distinct from the causal process that one is trying to measure. The conducting of research itself may lead to certain outcomes affecting the researched group, but this effect is not what is called sampling error. Sampling error always refers to the recognized limitations of any supposedly representative sample population in reflecting the larger totality, and the error refers only to the discrepancy that may result from judging the whole on the basis of a much smaller number. This is only an \"error\" in the sense that it would automatically be corrected if the totality were itself assessed. The term has no real meaning outside of statistics.\n\nAccording to a differing view, a potential example of a sampling error in evolution is genetic drift; a change in a population’s allele frequencies due to chance. For example, the bottleneck effect; when natural disasters dramatically reduce the size of a population resulting in a small population that may or may not fairly represent the original population. What may make the bottleneck effect a sampling error is that certain alleles, due to natural disaster, are more common while others may disappear completely, making it a potential sampling error. Another example of genetic drift that is a potential sampling error is the founder effect. The founder effect is when a few individuals from a larger population settle a new isolated area. In this instance, there are only a few individuals with little gene variety, making it a potential sampling error.\n\nThe likely size of the sampling error can generally be controlled by taking a large enough random sample from the population, although the cost of doing this may be prohibitive; see sample size determination and statistical power for more detail. If the observations are collected from a random sample, statistical theory provides probabilistic estimates of the likely size of the sampling error for a particular statistic or estimator. These are often expressed in terms of its standard error.\n\nSampling bias is a possible source of sampling errors, wherein the sample is chosen in a way that makes some individuals less likely to be included in the sample than others. It leads to sampling errors which either have a prevalence to be positive or negative. Such errors can be considered to be systematic errors.\n\nSampling error can be contrasted with non-sampling error. Non-sampling error is a catch-all term for the deviations from the true value that are not a function of the sample chosen, including various systematic errors and any random errors that are not due to sampling. Non-sampling errors are much harder to quantify than sampling error.\n\n"}

Familiarly known as \"Q Martel\" or just \"Q\", he was a pioneering British military engineer and tank strategist.\n\nBorn into a traditional military family he was the son of Brigadier-General Sir Charles Philip Martel who was Chief Superintendent of Ordnance Factories. He married Maud Mackenzie on 29 July 1922 and they had two children, a son, Major Peter Martel, MC, born 1923 and a daughter, Gillian, born 1925.\n\nMartel entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1908 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the British Army's Royal Engineers on 23 July 1909. Martel was instrumental in the establishment of The Royal Navy and Army Boxing Association in 1911 and was Army and Inter Services boxing champion both before and after World War I.\n\nIn 1916, as a sapper officer with direct experience of the first British use of tanks on the Somme, Martel was put in charge of recreating a wide replica of the British and German trench systems, complete with no man's land, at Elveden, Norfolk, as part of a tank training ground.\n\nThere he developed a keen interest in tank theory believing them to be the future of warfare and in November 1916 he wrote a paper, \"A Tank Army\", suggesting an army composed entirely of armoured vehicles. As J. F. C. Fuller's GSO3 the wide-ranging ideas set out in this paper profoundly influenced Fuller's thinking which at the time simply regarded the tank as no more than a useful adjunct to infantry on the battlefield. Martel was also interested in the construction of wire net roads as deployed in the British Army's 1917–1918 campaign in the Sinai and Palestine and their use in supporting tracked vehicles.\n\nIn late 1916, Martel was on Hugh Elles' staff at Bermicourt in France assisting Fuller on the operational planning that culminated in the British tank tactics employed at the Battle of Cambrai.\n\nIn addition to his MC (1915) and DSO (1916), in the course of the war Martel was mentioned in dispatches five times.\n\nIn 1919, now a Major, Martel was able to combine his two interests of tanks and military bridging when he became head of the Experimental Bridging Establishment at Christchurch, Hampshire, which researched the possibilities of using tanks for battlefield engineering purposes such as bridge-laying and mine-clearing. Here he continued trials on modified Mark V tanks. The bridging component involved an assault bridge, designed by Major Charles Inglis RE, the Canal Lock Bridge, which had sufficient length to span a canal lock. Major Martel mated the bridge with the tank and used hydraulic power generated by the tank's engine to manoeuvre the bridge into place. For mine clearance the tanks were equipped with 2-ton rollers.\n\nMartel also developed his new bridging concept at the EBE, the Martel bridge, a modular box girder bridge suitable for military use. The Martel bridge was adopted by the British Army in 1925 as the Large Box Girder Bridge. A smaller version, the Small Box Girder Bridge, was also formally adopted by the Army in 1932 and copied by many countries, including Germany, who called their version the ( for short). The United States created a copy, the H-20. The modular construction of the basic Martel bridge was also used for the Bailey bridge. In 1954, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors awarded Martel £500 for infringement on the design of his bridge by the designer of the Bailey bridge, Donald Bailey.\n\nMartel also continued to pursue his interest in tanks independently. In 1925 he built, in his own garage, a one-man tankette powered by a car engine and capable of a speed of . After a demonstration to the War Office, Morris Commercial Motors was contracted to build four test models, the first of which was delivered in 1926. Carden Loyd Tractors built a similar one-man machine, the Carden Loyd One Man Tankette.\n\nIn 1927, eight more Martel tankettes were ordered to assess their potential role in forward reconnaissance. They were tested along with two-man Carden Loyd tankettes in manoeuvres with the Experimental Mechanized Force on Salisbury Plain in 1927 and 1928 when Martel was commanding officer of a company of Royal Engineers stationed there.\n\nThe idea for a single-man fighting vehicle was soon dropped as it became apparent that one operator could not control the vehicle at the same time as firing a weapon and the British Army requirement for a light tank, the Light Tank Mark I, was a development of the Carden Loyd tankette. Morris Motors tried developing a two-man version of the Martel design and Crossley Motors a further version - the Morris-Martel - in 1927 with Kégresse rubber tracks but after two prototypes were tested the project was abandoned.\n\nIn 1928, the Tank and Tracked Transport Advisory Committee that Martel was a member of became the Mechanical Warfare Board which was to liaise with industry and to advise on technical matters relating to \"mechanised transport\". In 1929, Martel was seconded to the King George V's Own Bengal Sappers and Miners and then served as an instructor at the British Indian Army's Staff College in Quetta from 1930 until 1934. From 1936 until 1939, Martel served at the War Office, firstly as Assistant Director of Mechanisation, then from 1938 as the Deputy Director with the temporary rank of Brigadier. In 1936, he attended a large-scale tank exercise in the Belorussian Military District of the Soviet Union in which numbers of the Soviet variant of the Carden Loyd tankette, the T-27, took part.\n\nIn the prelude to the Second World War, Martel was appointed General Officer Commanding the 50th Northumbrian Division, Territorial Army in February 1939 with the rank of Major-General. The division had been converted from October 1938 to \"motorised\" with the whole of the infantry being carried by large lorries.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, 50 Division embarked for France on 14 September 1939 as part of the British Expeditionary Force. There, on 21 May 1940 during the Battle of France, Martel directed the tank attack on Generalmajor Erwin Rommel's 7th Panzer Division in the Battle of Arras in which the German frontline was driven back eight miles. The gains could not be held, but the Germans were forced to cease their offensive and regroup, so buying time for the BEF's evacuation from Dunkirk.\n\nFollowing the BEF's evacuation, Martel became the Commander of the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940 where he put his theories of armoured warfare to good use. In March 1941, he gave the Military Attaché of the then neutral United States in London, Brigadier General Raymond E. Lee, a report outlining his experiences and assessment of the German armoured tactics in France.\n\nMartel was promoted to Lieutenant-General in 1942 but was moved from the Royal Armoured Corps that September and the position of commander was abolished. He then spent some time on postings in Burma and India.\n\nIn March 1943, Martel became the Head of the Military Mission to the Soviet Union. He assessed the effectiveness of the Soviet order of battle and tactics during a visit to the frontline in the Kursk-Oryol region between 11 and 19 May 1943. In his autobiography, Martel describes advising the Soviet High Command, Stavka, to allow the Germans to strike first at the Battle of Kursk. To what extent his advice affected the course of the battle is debatable since his first conference with Stavka did not occur until late May 1943 while the Soviet Western Front commander, Marshal Georgy Zhukov, had been advocating the same tactic since the previous March. However, Martel's advice that the most effective way of preventing the enemy from exploiting a breakthrough was by pushing on the \"shoulders\" (or \"haunches\") of the penetration may have proven useful.\n\nHis subsequent reports based on his visit to the Soviet front line and his discussions with the Red Army Tank Directorate concluded that the Soviet battlefield experience would be far more relevant to armoured tactics in the forthcoming invasion of Normandy than that of the experience of the British Army in the North African Campaign. Martel's intelligence-gathering and his clear and perceptive analyses of the Soviet military position were commended by his superiors at the War Office, but with the arrival of the new and overtly anti-communist Head of RAF Mission, Air Marshal Sir John Babington in September 1943 his working relationship with the Soviets deteriorated with a marked decline in co-operation. He was recalled, being replaced by Lieutenant-General Montagu Brocas Burrows and left Moscow on 7 February 1944. Later that month, he lost his right eye as a result of a German bombing raid on London.\n\nMartel was knighted in 1943 and retired from the Army in 1945 with the rank of Lieutenant-General. He stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative Party candidate for the Barnard Castle constituency in the 1945 UK General Election.\n\nOn his retirement, Martel wrote on military matters. He died at his home in Camberley, Surrey, on 3 September 1958.\n\n\n\n"}

Based in Ireland and the UK, McCoy rode a record 4,358 winners, and was Champion Jockey a record 20 consecutive times, every year he was a professional. He stands 1.78 m (5'10\"), far taller than most jockeys.\n\nMcCoy recorded his first winner in 1992 at age 17. On 7 November 2013 he rode his 4,000th winner, riding Mountain Tunes to victory at Towcester. Even in his first season riding in Britain, as an apprentice for trainer Toby Balding, McCoy won the Conditional Jump Jockeys Title with a record 74 winners for a conditional jockey. McCoy claimed his first Champion Jockey title in 1995/96 and went on to win it every year until his retirement in 2015.\n\nMcCoy has won almost every big race there is to win. His most high-profile winners include the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Champion Hurdle, Queen Mother Champion Chase, King George VI Chase and the 2010 Grand National, riding Don't Push It.\n\nHe was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2010, becoming the first jockey to win the award, and in December 2013 he was named RTÉ Sports Person of the Year. He was knighted in January 2016.\n\nMcCoy rode his first winner of his career on the Jim Bolger trained Legal Steps, in a flat race at Thurles racecourse in Ireland, on 26 March 1992 at the age of 17. McCoy served as an apprentice at Jim Bolger's stable for the initial part of his career. Whilst riding work for Bolger one morning, McCoy suffered a nasty fall and broke his leg on the gallops. By the time McCoy recovered from his leg break, he had continued to grow taller and as a result it was decided that the best option was to become a jump jockey. Success in Ireland soon led to a move across the Irish Sea, and he began riding in England in 1994. His first win in England came at Exeter on 7 September 1994 riding the Gordon Edwards trained Chickabiddy to a length victory. In his first season in England, McCoy served as a conditional jockey for successful trainer Toby Balding, which culminated in winning the Conditional Jump Jockeys Title in 1995. The following season he became champion jockey for the first time.\n\nMcCoy had burst on the scene as a result of his first season riding in Britain and soon attracted the attention of leading trainer Martin Pipe and, then, upcoming Paul Nicholls. McCoy joined forces with powerful trainer Martin Pipe in 1997 and between them they proved to be an exceptionally strong partnership which dominated the sport.\n\nBy the end of the decade McCoy had set a new National Hunt record for winners in a season (253), equaled the record of five winners at the 1998 Cheltenham Festival, and became the fastest jockey to reach the 100 winner mark in a season in 2001. He went on to beat the long-standing record of Gordon Richards for the total number of winners ridden in a season, which stood since 1947. McCoy has said he counts this as his biggest achievement, despite his multiple Champion Jockey titles and big race victories.\n\nHe beat Richards' record of 269 winners in a season on Valfonic at Warwick on 2 April 2002. He achieved a new high of 289 winners, and on 27 August 2002, at Uttoxeter, his victory on Mighty Montefalco meant he had surpassed Richard Dunwoody's all time jumps record and was now the leading jumps jockey. He became the first jump jockey to ride 2,500 winners when getting Kanpai up to score at Huntingdon on 3 October 2006. McCoy rode his 3000th winner at Plumpton on the Nicky Henderson trained Restless D'Artaix in the Tyser & Co Beginners' Chase on 9 February 2009.\n\nIn spite of wins in the biggest races on the jumps racing calendar, including the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Champion Hurdle, Queen Mother Champion Chase, and King George VI Chase, it was the Grand National which had eluded McCoy. The nearest he had in the National were three third-place finishes, in 2001, 2002 aboard Martin Pipe's Blowing Wind, and in 2005 on Jonjo O'Neill's 5-1 joint favourite, Clan Royal, who was still traveling well when hampered by a loose horse cost any chance of victory. McCoy won the Grand National at the fifteenth attempt, on 10 April 2010 aboard Don't Push It, trained by Jonjo O'Neill and owned by J. P. McManus.\n\nIn 2012, McCoy won his second Cheltenham Gold Cup on Synchronised, trained by Jonjo O'Neill and owned by JP McManus, 15 years after his first Gold Cup win on Mr Mulligan. McCoy's winning ride on Synchronised typified his career as a jockey. Synchronised appeared outpaced during the first half of the extended 3 mile contest, however, Synchronised stayed on powerfully up the famous Cheltenham hill to pass both former winner Long Run and The Giant Bolster to land blue riband event at the Cheltenham Festival.\n\nDuring the 2012 Grand National, McCoy's mount Synchronised fell at Becher's Brook, the sixth fence on the first circuit. The horse suffered soft-tissue damage, but did not appear to have sustained serious injury. However, Synchronised continued running riderless, until attempting to jump the 11th fence where he fell and incurred a fracture of the tibia and fibula in his right-hind leg, which resulted in him being put down.\n\nMcCoy made a delayed start to the 2013/2014 National Hunt season after breaking his ribs from a heavy fall on the Nicky Henderson trained Quantitativeeasing in a handicap hurdle at Cheltenham's end of season April meeting. McCoy, who spent seven nights in hospital, returned to action a month later at Ludlow and immediately opened his account for the season on the JP McManus owned horse Church Field. He surpassed the 100 winner mark for the 2013/2014 season after riding a remarkable 5-timer at Carlisle racecourse in October, closely followed by 5 winners over the two-day Aintree October meeting.\n\nMcCoy sealed his 4000th career win riding the Jonjo O'Neill trained Mountain Tunes, in the colours of owner JP McManus, to a hard-fought victory in the Weatherbys Novices' Hurdle at Towcester on 7 November 2013. His mount, Mountain Tunes, looked to have little chance with two hurdles to jump yet McCoy managed to get up in the final strides to beat Kris Spin ridden by Jamie Moore.\n\nOn 30 November 2013, Tony McCoy had the choice to ride at Newbury, or Newcastle. McCoy rode My Tent Or Yours to victory in the Grade One Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle, which eventually turned out to be a good decision as on the same day, At Fishers Cross flopped in the Long Walk Hurdle at Newbury. McCoy reached the 150 winners landmark for the 2013/2014 season after riding a double at Ffos Las racecourse on 16 December 2013. This was the 18th time, out of the 20 seasons riding in Britain, he has surpassed 150 winners for a season. At the end of the 2013/14 season, McCoy was crowned Champion jockey for the 19th consecutive time, further extending his record of title wins.\n\nOn 10 June 2014, McCoy recorded his fastest ever half century of winners for a season after riding the Rebecca Curtis trained Bob Keown to victory at Worcester Racecourse. McCoy achieved the 50 winner mark for the 2014/15 National Hunt season, which started on 27 April 2014, in just 44 days.\n\nOn 19 July 2014, McCoy reached a significant personal milestone by surpassing the total of 4,191 winners which friend and mentor Martin Pipe achieved as a licensed trainer before retirement in 2006. McCoy recorded winner number 4,192 by guiding the Jonjo O'Neill trained It's A Gimme to victory in the Betfred Summer Plate Listed Handicap Chase at Market Rasen Racecourse. McCoy enjoyed a long period of success as stable jockey to the 15 time Champion Trainer Martin Pipe.\n\nMcCoy broke his own record for the fastest ever century of winners for a National Hunt season, recording his 100th winner of the 2014/15 campaign on board the John Ferguson trained Arabic History at Newton Abbot Racecourse on 21 August 2014, 116 days into the season. McCoy's previous record, set during the 2001/2002 season, stood at 100 winners by 4 September, approximately 130 days into the season.\n\nMcCoy announced live on Channel 4 after his win on Mr Mole in the Game Spirit Chase that he would retire at the end of the 2014/15 NH Season. It was his 200th win of the season, the ninth occasion on which he had reached that landmark, and he later clarified that it would be his last such achievement. His last ride as a professional was at the Bet365 Gold Cup meeting at Sandown in April 2015.\n\nMcCoy was retained by Irish racehorse owner, J. P. McManus and therefore rode all of his horses in Britain and occasionally Ireland. McCoy joined forces with McManus in 2004 after reportedly being offered a £1 million a year retainer. McCoy had previously spent seven years as Martin Pipe's first jockey and many within racing were surprised of his decision to split from the successful Pipe stable. He has won a further 10 jockey titles since their separation.\n\nMcManus has the majority of his horses in training with ex-jockey Jonjo O'Neill who trains at the state-of-the-art training facility \"Jackdaws Castle\" in Gloucestershire, which is owned by McManus. McCoy often rode horses trained by Jonjo O'Neill in addition to those owned by McManus. When he was not required to ride for McManus or O'Neill, McCoy had struck up a number of links with leading national hunt trainers. He rode a number of horses for Welsh-based trainer Rebecca Curtis. He also linked up with powerful trainer Nicky Henderson when his first jockey Barry Geraghty was riding in Ireland. McCoy was most commonly associated with the green and gold hooped silks of McManus.\n\nMcCoy was named 2010 BBC Sports Personality of the Year and in doing so became the first jockey to win the award, polling ahead of darts player Phil Taylor and Olympic heptathlete Jessica Ennis, who finished second and third place respectively. McCoy's win in the 2010 Grand National at his 15th attempt on board the Jonjo O'Neill trained Don't Push It was seen to be the main contributing factor to his win.\n\nMcCoy was made the bookmakers' favourite for the award after his Grand National victory, however there were concerns that those beyond the horse racing fraternity may not fully understand his incredible achievements in racing and subsequently decide to vote for other contenders from \"mainstream\" sports. He received 293,152 votes, which was more than former winners Joe Calzaghe (2007), Sir Chris Hoy (2008) or Ryan Giggs (2009).\n\nHe made the final shortlist of ten for BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2013 after surpassing the landmark total of 4000 career winners over jumps during the course of the 2013/2014 National Hunt racing season. McCoy finished in third place behind the winner Andy Murray and runner up Leigh Halfpenny. He was named 2013 RTÉ Irish Sports Personality of the Year on 21 December 2013.\n\nMcCoy was born in Moneyglass, County Antrim. He and his wife Chanelle have two children, named Eve and Archie. Far taller than most jockeys, he stands 1.78 m (5'10\"). To maintain a suitable racing weight, McCoy had to keep his weight down to . His natural weight, based on his physiology, should be about 75 kg (one and a half stone more).\n\nMcCoy has released five volumes of his autobiography; \"Real McCoy: My Life So Far\" (1999), \"McCoy\" (2003), \"A.P. McCoy: My Autobiography\" (2011) and \"Winner: My Racing Life\" (2015). McCoy's debut novel, \"Taking the Fall\", was published in 2013.\nMcCoy is an Arsenal fan. McCoy is a friend of Arsenal legend Ray Parlour and played a part in the naming of a racehorse \"The Romford Pele\", in reference to Parlour's nickname during his playing days.\n\nMcCoy has also got strong friendships with other footballers, including former Liverpool duo Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler, who engaged him and Martin Pipe for Cheltenham.\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that McCoy is to join BBC Radio 5 Live as a racing pundit every Friday evening on the \"5 Live Sport\" programme hosted by Dan Walker. BBC head of radio sport Richard Burgess said: \"This addition means our audiences will get a regular insight from one of the sport's greats.\"\n\nIn 2017, his wife, Chanelle McCoy was unveiled as the new dragon in RTE's Dragons' Den, replacing former dragon Eamonn Quinn. \"\n\nChampion Jockey: 1995/96, 1996/97, 1997/98, 1998/99, 1999/2000, 2000/01, 2001/02, 2002/03, 2003/04, 2004/05, 2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/2013, 2013/2014, 2014/2015\n\nChampion Conditional Jockey: 1994/95\n\nLester Awards:\nMcCoy has been honoured with 20 Lester Awards during his riding career to date, the most of any jockey past or present.\n\nMcCoy was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2003 Birthday Honours and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours for his services to horse racing.\n\nIn December 2010, McCoy was named Sportsman of the Year at the British Sports Awards in London, voted for by the Sports Journalists' Association.\n\nIn 2010, McCoy won the 'Jump off the Sofa Moment' Award at the Jaguar Academy of Sport Annual Awards ceremony for his Grand National win.\n\nIn December 2013, McCoy was officially awarded three Guinness World Records.

The verse occurs in the section relating the preachings of John the Baptist. In this verse he predicts that he will be followed by someone much greater than himself. The main theme of this verse is that John will soon be supplanted by a much greater figure and that John's water baptism is just a preparation for the much greater baptism by fire and spirit that will occur under the second coming of the Christian messiah Jesus, an original Christian concept that, according to Jewish scholars, lacks any fundament in the Hebrew scripture.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe New International Version translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 3:11\n\nThis verse links up with the Gospel of Mark for the first time since . In Mark this verse is mirrored by and . This verse is also found in Luke at . However the context is somewhat different in Luke John is addressing a receptive multitude in Matthew it is assumed he is still speaking to the Pharisees and Sadducees introduced in . Schweizer notes that despite this, the verse is still written as though it is addressing all Israel. Matthew has also entirely skipped the content found in . This is understandable as the response from the crowd is not in keeping with the hostile and unrepentant Pharisees and Sadducees.\n\nFrance notes that the word translated as \"after\" is not chronological, rather it means the one who is a follower or disciple. This links in with the reference to shoes. At the time the disciple of a Rabbi would be expected to perform menial chores. However shoes, a word perhaps better translated as sandals, were considered unclean, a tradition that persists in the Middle East today. Thus the disciple would not deal with them, and such a task would be left to the lowest slave. Thus John the Baptist is presenting himself as very lowly indeed. Matthew slightly differs from the wording found in Luke and Mark. In those two gospels John is not worthy of untying the messiah's sandals, in Matthew he is unworthy of carrying them.\n\nJohn predicts a much stronger form of baptism by the Holy Spirit and by fire. It is from this verse that the expression \"baptism by fire\" comes from. Hill notes for many years scholars felt that linking the Holy Spirit with fire, a symbol of God's wrath, clashed with the portrayal of the Spirit elsewhere in the New Testament, which saw it as a purely loving and helpful force incompatible with a destructive judgement. A number of theories were proposed to address this, some translations dropped the word fire to create a less destructive image. Another option is that \"Holy Spirit\" should actually read \"wind\", as the same word can be used for wind and spirit in Greek. This would also link it to the next verse. This all changed with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran, near where John the Baptist was said to be preaching. In a number of the texts the Holy Spirit is linked to God's wrath and judgement leading most scholars to include that the wording here is original and that there were different views of the Holy Spirit circulating in the first century. Nolland notes that many scholars have attempted to use this verse as evidence for the Christian baptism ritual, but he does not believe that Jesus' baptism by fire and holy spirit can be so linked.\n\nWhether the more powerful one coming after is a reference to God or Jesus is a matter of debate. After this verse Jesus immediately enters the narrative, and the corporeal metaphor of carrying his shoes would seem to describe a human figure. On the other hand, this violent imagery contradicts the idea of the Messiah as a bringer of peace. Schnackenburg argues the wording in this passage is deliberately obscure between the two options.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this verse are:\n"}

He is best known as an advisor to, and close friend of Martin Luther King Jr., for whom he helped write speeches, raise funds, and organize events.\n\nStanley David Levison was born in New York City on May 2, 1912, to a Jewish family. Levison attended the University of Michigan, Columbia University, and the New School for Social Research. He received two law degrees from St. John's University. While serving as treasurer of the American Jewish Congress in Manhattan, he aided in the defense of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. During this period, he worked for a variety of liberal causes.\n\nIn the early 1950s the FBI considered Levison to be a major financial coordinator for the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and began to monitor his activities. The FBI had him under the surveillance of Jack and Morris Childs, two former CPUSA members who became FBI informants. According to the FBI, Levison's CPUSA activities ended in 1957.\n\nHe had initially been introduced to King by Bayard Rustin, a Quaker, in New York City in 1956. Though King had offered to pay Levison in exchange for his help, Levison refused on every occasion, as he believed \"the liberation struggle is the most positive and rewarding area of work anyone could experience.\"\n\nHe was questioned by the FBI twice, on February 9 and March 4, 1960. Two years later, on April 30, 1962, he was called to testify under subpoena at an executive session of the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security, where he was represented by William Kunstler. Large parts of his testimony are still classified.\n\nAlthough there was no evidence of Levison having further ties to the CPUSA, the FBI used his earlier communist history to justify wiretaps and bugs on his offices and the offices and hotel rooms of Martin Luther King. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had long associated the civil rights movement with communism, and he strongly expected that Levison would use or manipulate King to stimulate political unrest within the United States. In 2012, Tim Weiner wrote in his history of the FBI that Hoover believed Levison had \"indoctrinated King in Marxist thought and subversive strategies\", and that King was \"part of Moscow's grand design to subvert the United States of America.\"\n\nLevison was instrumental in all the activities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the organization established by King and other Southern black preachers to further the cause of civil rights. He professionalized the fund raising of the organization and took on many of the publicity tasks, in addition to serving as King's literary agent. He was also a close adviser to King and a ghostwriter for him. Some of Levison's conversations with Dr. King are reproduced verbatim from FBI wiretaps in Taylor Branch's biography of Dr. King, \"Parting the waters : America in the King years, 1954-63\". Levison himself initiated the end of his association with Dr. King in 1963, following the revelation to Dr. King's circle that Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and then President John F. Kennedy had pressured Dr. King in person to break with Levison (and Jack O'Dell).\n\nAfter suffering from cancer and diabetes, Levison died in 1979.\n\nLevison's role as advisor and friend to King was portrayed by actor Steven Hill in \"King\", a 1978 television miniseries. He is also portrayed by Bruce Nozick in \"All the Way\". He was portrayed by Larry Keith in the 1983 miniseries Kennedy\n\n\n"}

He was a man of restless and adventurous disposition, unscrupulous even for the age in which he lived, visited many of the European courts, and served as a soldier in Austria, Italy and Spain.\n\nReturning to Berlin in 1735, he obtained a position in the household of King Frederick William I of Prussia and afterwards in that of Frederick the Great, with whom he appears to have been a great favorite; and he died in Berlin on June 23, 1775.\n\nPöllnitz's \"Mémoires\" (Liège, 1734), which were translated into German (Frankfurt, 1735), give interesting glimpses of his life and the people whom he met, but they are very untrustworthy. He also wrote \"Nouveaux mémoires\" (Amsterdam, 1737); \"Etat abrégé de la cour de Saxe sous le règne d'Auguste III.\" (Frankfurt, 1734; Ger. trans., Breslau, 1736); and \"Mémoires pour servir a l'histoire des quatres derniers souverains de la maison de Branderibourg\", published by F.

He played as a first baseman in Major League Baseball from 1947 to 1955. A five-time All-Star, Fain won two American League batting championships and his career on-base percentage of .424 is the 13th highest in Major League Baseball history.\n\nFain played nine seasons with the Philadelphia Athletics, Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians in the American League. Known as one of the Athletics' last stars before moving to Kansas City, he had an explosive temper on and off the field. Eventually it affected his playing ability, and the Athletics traded him after the 1952 season. In his later life, Fain made headlines for his troubles with the law, mainly growing marijuana.\n\nFerris Fain was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Oscar Fain, a jockey best known for leading his horse Duval to a second-place finish in the 1912 Kentucky Derby, and a domestic maid. He had a \"very abusive\" childhood, mainly at the hands of the father, who died when he was still a child. His mother did domestic work in order for the family to survive. He grew up in Oakland, California, where he graduated from Roosevelt High School as student body president. He joined the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League during his senior year of high school, when Seals manager Lefty O'Doul offered to pay $200 a month \"under the table\", as Fain's amateur status made him ineligible to join the team. He spent 1939–1942 and 1946 with the Seals, where he led the league in runs batted in (RBIs) in 1941. He missed three seasons, 1943–45, due to military service, during which he played baseball for the Army.\n\nConnie Mack paid the Seals $6,500 for Fain's services in order for Fain to play for the Athletics in 1947. Playing a full schedule, the left-handed hitter had 461 at bats in his rookie season. That year, he batted .291 with seven home runs and 71 RBIs in 136 games. In the 1948 season, Fain played in 145 games, with an .288 batting average, seven home runs, and what would be a career high 88 runs batted in. Fain was a member of the 1949 Philadelphia Athletics team that set a major league team record by turning 217 double plays, a record which still stood as of 2016; Fain himself took part in 194 double plays as a first baseman. In 1950 Fain played in a career high 150 games, batting .282 with 10 home runs and 83 RBI as he was named to his first All-Star team.\n\nFain broke through during the 1951 season, leading the American League with a .344 batting average. He also hit six homers and 57 RBIs, although a broken foot limited him to 425 at-bats. That year he finished sixth in the Most Valuable Player Award voting as Yogi Berra won the award. During the 1952 season, Fain again led the American League with a .324 batting average, despite breaking his hand in a bar fight and hiding the injury from his manager Jimmie Dykes near the end of the season. He also led the league in doubles (43), and on-base percentage and third in hits as he finished sixth in the Most Valuable Player award behind winner and A's teammate Bobby Shantz. However, Fain was known for a hot temper in the field, along with a drinking problem, which caused tension with the team. After the 1952 season, the Athletics traded Fain to the Chicago White Sox for fellow first baseman Eddie Robinson and infielders Ed McGhee and Joe DeMaestri. After the trade, White Sox general manager Frank Lane proclaimed with his acquisition of Fain, the White Sox had the \"finest defensive infield in baseball\". The New York Yankees were also interested on Fain, but a deal couldn't get completed.\n\nAccording to former teammate Eddie Joost, Fain \"had a lifestyle of his own and would do exactly what he wanted to do. There were many things the players didn't like about him. Occasionally he'd overdrink and wouldn't be attentive on the field.\" Fain had an off-year in 1953 after getting into a brawl in a Maryland café with several White Sox fans. He was fined $600 by the White Sox, then sued for $50,000. In the 1953 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Fain scored the only run for the American League in the ninth inning of a 5-1 loss. After suffering a knee injury the following year, Fain never really got back on track. But on June 16, 1954, he hit an inside-the-park grand slam. He participated in his last All-Star Game as a starter alongside his White Sox infield teammates Nellie Fox, George Kell and Chico Carrasquel. It made the 1954 White Sox the first team ever to have four infield starters from the same team starting the All-Star Game. In 1955, he played for the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians. He batted .260 with two home runs and 31 RBIs; however he was hobbled by knee issues and retired after the season.\n\nFain finished with an on-base percentage of over .400 every full year that he played, and was in the top 10 in that category seven times in his career; he ranked in the top 10 in walks eight times.\n\nIn a nine-season career, he hit .290 with 48 home runs, 570 RBIs, and 1139 career hits in 3930 at bats. He also had 213 career doubles and a career .424 on-base percentage (13th best all-time). Not least of all, Fain was regarded by some as the best fielding first baseman in the majors until Vic Power assumed Fain's old position for the A's. Future Hall of Famer Joe Gordon stated that Fain was the greatest fielding first baseman he ever saw.\n\nFain became a custom home builder in Georgetown, California, in the 1970s. In 1985 the Placerville, California police department raided his home where they found several marijuana plants in his possession. He was charged with growing marijuana and sentenced to five years probation. In 1988, the police conducted another raid at his home, where he was found growing another 400 plants of marijuana in a barn used as a grow house. Fain was charged with possession to sale marijuana and was held without bail. He was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. In a 1994 interview with \"The Sacramento Bee\", Fain discussed his legal issues, stating that he \"knew how to grow the stuff. I was as adept at it as I was in playing baseball\", and that he was trying to make a living out of it. He led a mostly reclusive lifestyle with his second wife in his final years, with only the occasional interview.\n\nFain died October 18, 2001 at the age of 80, in Georgetown, California from complications from leukemia and diabetes.\n\n\n"}

The term was typically used as a term of derision by rural Americans who regarded them with amusement. It may refer to a \"fop\", or it may be a derogatory term for a person wearing inappropriate city-type business attire, particularly with a brusque or condescending attitude in areas where local residents are offended by an arrogant attitude combined with disdain and lack of respect for rural people and lifestyles. The term can be used to describe people who are perceived as dishonest, arrogant, or simply naive. \n\n\"City slicker\" was derisively given to people from the urban Eastern United States when they took on an attitude that their lifestyle and access to the culture of city life gave them superior intelligence. Rural people, particularly those in the west, notably cowboys, often used the perception of a snobbish attitude as justification for playing practical jokes on such people. \n\nThe archetypal city slicker is depicted as a spoiled, selfish, lazy, and/or wealthy individual, who considers people living on farms to be poor and ignorant. They are depicted as being unaccustomed to hard labour and as a result, tire very easily and complain when working. City slickers appeared often as deceitful characters in U.S. comic strips and movies before the middle of the 20th century, but usually to be \"outsmarted\" by the native wisdom and common sense of the locals or to somehow otherwise get their just deserts in the end.\n\nWhile the term is still used in rural areas today, other related terms include: dude, tenderfoot, and greenhorn; antonyms include yokel, bumpkin, and hick.\n"}

It is located on the shores of False Bay, on the eastern side of the Cape Peninsula. For more than two centuries it has been a naval base and harbour (first for the British Royal Navy and now the South African Navy). The town is named after Simon van der Stel, an early governor of the Cape Colony.\n\nThe land rises steeply from near the water's edge and the town is boxed in along the shoreline by the heights above. The small harbour itself is protected from swells by a breakwater that was built with thousands of huge blocks of sandstone quarried out of the face of the mountain above. \n\nSimon's Town is now in effect a suburb of greater Cape Town. The Simon's Town railway station is the terminus of the Southern Line, a railway line that runs south from the central business district of Cape Town. In places, the railway line runs along the steep eastern shore of False Bay, and in bad weather waves and foam from some heavy swells wet the trains.\n\nBoulders Beach is located a few kilometres to the south of Simon's Town, in the direction of Miller's Point. Here small coves and beaches are interspersed between boulders of Cape granite. There has been a colony of African penguins at Boulders Beach since 1985. There is no record of the birds having lived here prior to that date. There are only three penguin populations on the mainland in southern Africa; the others are close to Hermanus at Stoney Point and Betty's Bay.\n\nIn the last weeks of 1795 or the first weeks of 1796 the British built a round tower on a site that today falls within the Naval Base. Britain had just annexed the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope and wanted to establish some defences to ward off possible Dutch or French attacks. The resulting tower was high, had a base diameter of , and walls thick, though there is no evidence that the British ever installed the guns the tower was designed to hold. In front of the tower the British also constructed a battery that they did arm with cannons. The Martello tower was used as a navigational beacon for ships entering Simon's Bay and was consequently white-washed in about 1843. The tower was restored in 1972 by the Simon's Town Historical Society (in conjunction with the South African Navy), and proclaimed a provincial heritage site; today it houses a small museum.\n\nThe South African Naval Museum is a maritime museum, which contains collections and artefacts related to the maritime history of South Africa and the South African Navy. \nSimon's Town Museum is a community museum established in 1977 and located in The Residency, an historical building erected by Governor Joachim van Plettenberg in 1777. The museum records and preserves all aspects of the history of the Simon's Town community.\n\nIn 1985, a statue of Just Nuisance, the only dog ever to be officially enlisted in the Royal Navy, was erected in a position overlooking the harbour. The Simon's Town Museum has an exhibition dedicated to his story.\n\nSimon's Town became a free port in 1832.\n\nThe Simon's Town municipal council assumed a coat of arms, designed by Adelbert Bonn, in September 1905. It was granted by the College of Arms on 27 September 1957.\n\nThe design is described as: \"Quarterly: I and IV, per pale, the dexter Argent, three towers placed 2 and 1 Gules, the sinister per fess Or and Azure, in chief on a mount Vert a peacock in his pride proper and in base three plates placed 2 and 1 Argent; II and III, Azure, an estoile and in chief three crescents Argent; over all an oval cartouche with scrolled edges Or, charged with a demi-lion rampant Gules, issuant from three barrulets wavy Vert\". In layman's terms, the shield is divided into four quarters. The first quarter is divided vertically, one half depicting three red towers on a silver background, the other a peacock on a gold background above three silver discs on a red background; the second quarter is blue, with three silver crescents at the top and a wavy star below on a blue background; the third quarter is the same as the second and the fourth the same as the first; in the centre is an oval with a decorative edge displaying a red lion emerging from wavy green stripes on a golden background.\n\nThese were a slightly modified version of the arms of Willem Adriaan van der Stel, which Bonn mistakenly thought were those of his father Simon van der Stel.\n\nThe crest was the figure of Britannia resting on a golden naval crown. Two golden anchors were placed behind the shield. The motto was \"Fac et spera\".\n\nWhen the municipality was dissolved in 1996, the council placed its regalia, including the letters patent from the College of Arms, in the custody of the Simon's Town Historical Society. The society registered the arms in its own name at the Bureau of Heraldry in October 1999.\n\n\n"}

It is the fourth game in the \"Syphon Filter\" series.\n\nThe gameplay is a departure from the previous games. Rather than playing as Gabe Logan, the player is given the role of a new recruit working for Gabe's secret anti-terrorist organization, the IPCA. Players are able to create an original agent using a character customization system.\n\nThe game is nonlinear, where players are given choices to take on certain tasks, or avoid them altogether. Role-playing elements are added so that players can create characters, level up their ranks, and unlock new weapons. Enemies spawn so that players can never clear an area.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the original Syphon Filter virus, Gabriel Logan repurposes the agency Agency as the International Presidential Consulting Agency, serving as a counterterrorism unit. As Commander-in-Chief, Logan has Lian Xing, Teresa Lipan, Lawrence Mujari, and Dr. Elsa Weissenger serve as his officers.\n\nAn Agency team headed by Imani Gray is deployed to a besieged Carthage, Michigan in order to rescue Mujari, who disappeared while investigating Dr. Richard Broussard's ties with the Anarchiste Liberation Army. Imani and her team successfully rescue Mujari, and assassinate the ALA leadership then prepare for their next assignment.\n\nMeanwhile, IPCA commander Gary Stoneman assassinates Italian mafia leader Dimitri Alexopoulous to prevent his acquisition of the Omega Strain in Italy. The team follows Stone to Belarus and tracks a shipment of infected cattle to Ivankov's residence. They discover that his courier Yuschenko is selling the Omega Strain, and Agency pilot Alima Haddad is captured by the Chechens during the operation.\n\nDuring the Belarus operation, Lian is deployed to Kyrgyzstan in order to eliminate an arms deal involving a local warlord and the North Koreans.\n\nGabe reluctantly enlists help from Mossad agent Ehud Ben Zohar upon determining Yuschenko's plans to sell the virus to Fatha Al-Hassan, a Yemeni leader. Zohar only cares about stopping Al-Hassan's network, so he steals the viral canister after the Agency retrieves it from Yuschenko. Zohar and the team enter Al-Hassan's palace disguised as the dead Chechens in order to assassinate him. In the aftermath, they exchange the contracts for the virus.\n\nThe team investigates a lead recovered from the Belarus operation that shows Dr. Nikolai Jandran is conducting virus tests at a local university. Maggie Powers assists in recovering evidence before the university's destruction.\n\nShortly after recovering, Mujari conducts his own investigation into the Chechens and photographs Russian forces committing war atrocities for future blackmail. Afterwards, Mujari takes control of the Agency team as they check the wreckage of the S.S. Lorelei. The university turned up salvaged boxes, indicating an undersea operation. The team evacuates the salvage rig before destroying the viral containers for good. However, Jandran dies from a serum before he can be brought back for questioning.\n\nWhile Gabe faces pressure from the U.S. president and Alex Birchim of the White House Internal Affairs, he sends Lian and the team to track North Korean agent Yong-jun Kim, a man connected to the Yakuza's Murakawa Industries in Japan. The investigation reveals that Murakawa was helping develop the Omega Strain. Aramov arrived before Lian and forced Murakawa to commit suicide for trusting Kim. Kim posed as an employee working with Murakawa so he could get the virus.\n\nShortly after destroying the Japanese labs, the team is re-deployed to recover Imani in Myanmar. The plane carrying Imani and Kim had been shot down. Guilt-ridden, Lian takes the team to recover her body and the viral sample Kim was carrying. Despite claims that inclement weather brought down the jet, they find evidence indicating that Aramov had bribed the Myanmar army to shoot down the plane.\n\nGabe becomes frustrated with his investigation into the secret corporation Meta Global Funds, which he believes controls the Syphon Filter conspiracy. The purchase of Murakawa Industries by Meta Global was possible through Niculescu Funds, headed by international banker Mihai Niculescu. He deduces that Niculescu as the mastermind behind the conspiracy. Against Birchim's commands, Gabe brings the Agency team to the headquarters in Zurich. They find evidence linking Birchim to bribes, but nothing implicating Niculescu, and upload a virus to sabotage Niculescu financially.\n\nGabe conducts a solo investigation into Niculescu's Montenegro estate in a final effort to expose him. Although he did not find physical evidence, he learns of Aramov's ties to Niculescu and learns that Ivankov plans to nuke Russia.\n\nHaving learned of Ivankov's location from Mara, the Agency mobilises to his base and prevents the missile's launch. Stone recovers an injured Alima. Ivankov is eventually killed by Gabe while attempting to escape.\n\nThanks to tissue and virus samples recovered by the IPCA, a vaccine for the Omega Strain virus is successfully synthesized, ending the threat with the aid of the World Health Organization. The President congratulates the IPCA and has Birchim arrested. Niculescu is killed by two anonymous gunmen as a result of his bank's sabotage. Dr. Weissenger gives a written admission that she had the recruit kill Dr. Jandran, as well as signs of mental instability before disappearing from the Agency. Lastly, Stone aims his rifle at Aramov to assassinate her on Logan's order.\n\nIn a June 2007 interview with GameSpy, franchise veteran John Garvin maintained his attachment to the game, and explained that it was originally not intended to feature a single player mode. Garvin implied that the ability to play through the campaign alone had been tacked on at the demand of parent company Sony Computer Entertainment, late into the development process, in order to broaden the game's appeal.\n\n\"Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain\" received mixed reviews. It received a score of 65.36% on GameRankings based on 48 reviews and 65/100 on Metacritic based on 47 reviews.\n"}

Until 1633 it was seat of a family of nobles, the Vitzthums, which acted relatively independent. Between 1633 and World War I Apolda was property of Jena University. Nevertheless, from 1691 to 1809 Apolda was part of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar and from 1809 to 1918 of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (after 1815 Grand Duchy). Around 1700, the knitting industry began to grow, so that finally, at the end of the 19th century, Apolda was the wealthiest town of the whole region. After World War II, Thuringia became part of the German Democratic Republic. Up to German reunification Apolda still was famous for its textile industries. Since then, a notable economic decay has taken place.\n\nErnst Stegmann was the long-time mayor of Apolda with 33 years in office (1901-1934).\nIt possesses several churches and monuments to the Dobermann Pinscher dog breed, which was created in Apolda, and to Christian Zimmermann (1759–1842), who, by introducing the hosiery and cloth manufacture, made Apolda one of the most important places in Germany in these branches of industry. By 1900 it also had had extensive dyeworks, bell foundries, and manufactures of steam engines, boilers, cars and bicycles. After German reunification the majority of these had to be closed down for economical reasons.\n\nThe most important sights are:\nThe largest free hanging bell in the world, the \"Decke Pitter\" of Cologne Cathedral, was made in Apolda.

It is the second game in the \"Syphon Filter\" series.\n\nDevelopment of the game began after the release of \"Syphon Filter\", and continued over the course of a year. Released in 2000, it received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n\"Syphon Filter 2\" retained \"Syphon Filter\"s gameplay. The sequel added multiplayer which features some characters to select from (including deceased characters from \"Syphon Filter\"), as well as new maps not found in single player mode.\n\nHours after the events of the first game, Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing are enemies of the state to the Agency after uncovering its connection to Syphon Filter, labeled as terrorists to the general public. Agency operative Dillon Morgan captures Lian at the PharCom warehouses, forcing Gabe and the CBDC soldiers to rendezvous with ex-Agency operative Teresa Lipan in Arizona. Simultaneously, the Agency scrambles a squadron of F-22 Raptors to intercept their transport over the Colorado Rockies, so Gabe and CBDC Lieutenant Jason Chance head down the mountain in search of their plane and a box of PharCom data disks. Agency operative Steven Archer attempts to stop them at all costs. \n\nA group of conspirators, including Mara Aramov and Agency director Lyle Stevens, make a deal to deliver the virus to a rogue Chinese general named Shi-Hao. Meanwhile, Lian recovers in a U.S. Air Force base where Morgan, Derek Falkan, and Thomas Holman are working with Dr. Elsa Weissinger of PharCom to extract infected plasma from test subjects. Lian learns that the other subject was PharCom CEO Jonathan Phagan, who survived his gunshot wound long enough for the Agency to take the plasma. Weissinger protests that Phagan is useful and should be kept alive for further research, but Morgan, not intending that the U.S. government find Pharcom's CEO infected with an unknown virus, deactivates his life support, tying up a loose end.\n\nLian escapes the medical building and interrogates Holman to learn that Morgan is planning another operation to the PharCom Expo Center to find an encryption disk. She leaves the base in a helicopter after killing Falkan and teams up with Gabe to battle Archer's forces. Gabe shoots Archer during his escape, and recovers the PharCom data. \n\nThe protagonists follow Holman's lead to the Expo Center and kill Morgan before he can recover the disk he sought. After decrypting the PharCom data, Teresa realises that some information is missing. The other half must be with Russian SVR director Uri Gregorov, who appeared at the warehouses before Gabe left. Since Lian and Uri know each other, they agree to meet in Moscow. \n\nAramov instigates a gunfight while they meet and Lian pursues Gregorov. Lian later learns he is an impostor working for Mara and trying to find the other half of the data. The man admits that the \"real\" Gregorov is in a Russian gulag, Aljir Prison, which once held Lian captive. Gregorov uncovered a plot to sell the virus to Shi-Hao, so Aramov intervened. Lian stops Gregorov's execution, but is almost killed by the virus and collapses. Gabe takes her back to the States, while Gregorov promises to handle Shi-Hao. \n\nGabe and Teresa arrive back at the Virginia safehouse overseen by Lawrence Mujari, a freelance pathologist. They decide to trade the PharCom data to the Agency for Lian's vaccine. Director Stevens double-crosses Gabe in the Agency's New York City labs, but Logan escapes and forces Dr. Weissinger to give him the vaccine. Gabe also finds out that Chance survived the mission in Colorado, and sets him free. \n\nPursued by NYPD SWAT cops and Agency personnel, Gabe hurries back to their helicopter. Along the way, Logan is forced to provide cover for a SWAT officer whose partner is wounded. He does so, but Stevens, who later takes the cop hostage, orders him to drop his weapons. Despite Logan complying in surrender, Stevens kills the officer anyway. Before he can get shot, Gabe is thrown into the sewers by an explosion that Teresa sets off. Gabe assumes that Chance was killed in the labs since Teresa says he never made it to the helicopter. Gabe and Teresa eventually corner Stevens and Gabe shoots him in cold blood. \n\nGabe and Teresa reach the helicopter to find Chance waiting in impenetrable Agency-issued body armor. He was really working for them, and he seemingly kills Teresa. Gabe suspected it since the Agency always knew where he was in Colorado. Both men fight, and Gabe kills the man he trusted with an assault shotgun that drives Chance into the helicopter blades, decapitating him.\n\nA news report reveals that the Agency's existence is now public, and U.S. Secretary of State Vincent Hadden promises that the government will investigate. Gabe cures Lian and demarcates a grave for Teresa. He, Lian, and Lawrence hold a small memorial and promise to keep fighting, while soldiers watch them from a distance. In a post-credits scene, Hadden and Aramov emerge from a helicopter, with Aramov saying that the Administration will soon fall allowing Hadden to become President. Although a team of soldiers requests for permission to kill Gabe and his team, Hadden calls off the operation, telling Mara he has other plans for Gabe. Aramov laughs as the screen fades to black.\n\nJohn Garvin stated that, unlike development of the first game, he and co-creator Richard Ham had a complete vision of what the game would be like prior to the development process. \"I think I spent a weekend and wrote the entire screenplay. Rich and I got together and he helped revise the second half of the game, introducing all the Moscow stuff, making the end of the story more espionage-like and exciting. When the [development team] came back, we spent the next year building exactly what we had written. That was the first time that we had a vision up front, which we followed until the end.\" Garvin has expressed pride in his inclusion of a diverse cast of characters, such as the American-Indian Teresa Lipan, African-American Lawrence Mujari and Chinese Lian Xing.\n\n\"Syphon Filter 2\" was released to generally positive reviews. The game received an average score of 81.47% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of 29 reviews.\n\nMany reviewers stated that the game differed little from the original in terms of gameplay and graphics. Game Revolution rated the game 4 out of 5, concluding: \"Fans of the original should aim for the head and pull the trigger – this one’s a no-brainer.\" Doug Perry of IGN rated the game 8.9 out of 10, praising the two-player mode and favourably comparing it to similar features in \"Medal of Honor\". \n\nA less positive review came from Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot, who rated the game 6.6 out of 10. He writes: \"If you were a big fan of \"Syphon Filter\", you may get a kick out of the sequel, but the lackluster mission design and super-convoluted story really cancel out the improvements to the game's control.\"\n\nWhile most reviewers praised the game, the voice-acting was panned. Gerstmann stated: \"Some of Gabe's lines and vocal inflection really don't fit the current situation, making it sound as if he were lounging by the pool instead of taking heavy fire from entrenched enemies.\" Perry called the voice acting \"truly awful\", while Patrick Klepek of Gaming Age called the voice acting \"sub-par\", continuing: \"[...] the accents given to some of the characters are just terrible, though Gabe’s voice is probably the worst offender of them all.\"\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"If you don't mind a serious challenge, this game will reward your persistence with nail-biting action, excellent graphics, and a well told, memorable story.\"\n\nAs of 2007, \"Syphon Filter 2\" had sold 1.32 million copies, earning platinum status.\n"}

With the help of UN peacekeepers and captured personnel at the tower, the Ghosts shut down the sleeper cells in Cuba, paving the way for them to strike at the heart of the MFLC and ending their rebellion permanently. The game goes into little detail as to what happens after the MFLC are defeated, but supposedly their defeat shuts down the rebellion put up by the other rebel factions and the FARC across Colombia.\n\nCombined sales of \"Jungle Storm\" and \"\" reached 1.1 million copies by the end of March 2004.\n\n\"Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm\" received mixed reviews.

The first edition played from 1969 to 1985; the current franchise has played since 1997. Both franchises were based out of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The current team plays at Videotron Centre. The team is named after the Ramparts of Quebec City.\n\nThe Remparts have developed notable National Hockey League (NHL) players, including Simon Gagné, Kevin Lowe, Mike Ribeiro, Antoine Vermette, Marc-Édouard Vlasic and Hall of Famers Michel Goulet and Guy Lafleur.\n\nThe original Quebec Remparts team was founded in 1969 by a group of investors who purchased the assets of the junior Quebec Aces team. Some of the new owners included Paul Dumont, and Gérard Bolduc. The Remparts took up residence in the same arena as the Aces in the Colisée de Québec. The Remparts were finalists for the George Richardson Memorial Trophy in 1969–70, and eastern Canadian champions in 1970–71. It was this team, which featured future Hockey Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur, that won a Memorial Cup championship in 1971. The team also won the President's Cup five times. Gilles Courteau was the general manager of the Remparts from 1980 to 1985.\n\nAfter the 1984–85 season, the team went into dormancy for three seasons before being resurrected. After returning to play, then-sponsored by \"Le Collège Français\", the team moved to Longueuil to become the Longueuil Collège Français. The team played for three seasons before moving to Verdun in 1991 to become the Verdun Collège Français. The franchise ceased operations in 1994.\n\nThe current Remparts franchise was granted for the 1990–91 season and was known as the Beauport Harfangs, a suburb in the Quebec City metropolitan area. In 1997 the team moved to Quebec City, playing two seasons at PEPS on the campus of Laval University between 1997 and 1999. In 1999 the team moved into the Colisée de Québec.\n\nThey are considered one of the most popular Canadian Hockey League (CHL) teams, as they regularly draw over 11,000 spectators per game. Similar to the National Football League's Cleveland Browns, the team claims the history and records of the original Remparts.\n\nOn May 28, 2006, the Remparts won the Memorial Cup, beating the Moncton Wildcats 6–2 in the finals. Then-head coach Patrick Roy became the seventh coach to win the Cup in his first year as head coach, and the first to do so since Claude Julien of the Hull Olympiques in 1997. It was also the first time in Memorial Cup history that the finals involved two teams from the QMJHL. Quebec also won the Cup without winning a League championship and without hosting the event, another first in Memorial Cup history. \nOn November 27, 2014, the Remparts were sold to Quebecor for an estimated price between $20 million and $25 million. The Remparts were chosen to be the host of the 2015 Memorial Cup. They defeated the Rimouski Océanic in tie-breaker 5-2, but got eliminated by the Kelowna Rockets in the semi-finals 9-3. The team moved to Centre Vidéotron on September 12, 2015.\n\nMichel Goulet, and Guy Lafleur have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

Saint John has won three President's Cup championships in 2011, 2012 and 2017.\n\nThe city of Saint John was granted a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) expansion team for the 2005–06 season along with the St. John's Fog Devils. The Saint John Sea Dogs filled the hockey void left by the departure of the American Hockey League's (AHL) Saint John Flames in 2003. The Sea Dogs' first head coach was Christian La Rue under general manager Bob \"Tipper\" LeBlanc, and the captaincy was split between Charles Bergeron and Vincent Lambert. The Sea Dogs were also given the first overall pick at the 2005 QMJHL Draft, selecting defenceman Alex Grant. The Sea Dogs had a weak first season and missed the playoffs.\n\nDuring the offseason, Christian La Rue was fired and quickly replaced with former London Knights assistant coach Jacques Beaulieu. Beaulieu served as the head coach for the entire second season. Tipper Leblanc resigned mid-season, and Beaulieu stepped into the dual role of coach/general manager. The Sea Dogs' poor performance in their first season granted them another first overall pick at the 2006 QMJHL Draft, where they selected another defenceman, Yann Sauvé. The team missed the playoffs again and received another first overall pick in the 2007 draft where they selected defenceman Simon Després. In the same draft round, they selected Steven Anthony 10th overall. The team also selected goaltender Robert Mayer 3rd overall at the 2007 CHL Import Draft.\n\nThe Sea Dogs did not make a first-round selection in the 2008 QMJHL Entry Draft. In the second round, the Sea Dogs used their first pick to select defenceman Kevin Gagné, as well as signing Jacques Beaulieu's son Nathan to the roster.

DiDomenico was not able to play for Team QMJHL due to an injury and was replaced by 17-year-old Steven Anthony. Before the 2008–09 season, \"The Hockey News\" ranked the Sea Dogs the second-best team in the QMJHL, and 5th overall in the entire CHL.

There are several closely related theorems, which may be stated in terms of integral equations, in terms of linear algebra, or in terms of the Fredholm operator on Banach spaces.\n\nThe Fredholm alternative is one of the Fredholm theorems.\n\nFredholm's theorem in linear algebra is as follows: if \"M\" is a matrix, then the orthogonal complement of the row space of \"M\" is the null space of \"M\":\n\nSimilarly, the orthogonal complement of the column space of \"M\" is the null space of the adjoint:\n\nFredholm's theorem for integral equations is expressed as follows.

Then, Fredholm's theorem is that, for any fixed value of formula_7, these equations have either the trivial solution formula_10 or have the same number of linearly independent solutions formula_11, formula_12.\n\nA sufficient condition for this theorem to hold is for formula_3 to be square integrable on the rectangle formula_14 (where \"a\" and/or \"b\" may be minus or plus infinity).\n\nHere, the integral is expressed as a one-dimensional integral on the real number line.

Its narrative was inspired by the Russian novel \"Crime and Punishment\" (1866) by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and some of the influences on the game's artistic style include the work of film directors David Cronenberg, David Fincher, David Lynch, and Alfred Hitchcock; cultural references to history, films and literature can be found in the game. Psychological elements, such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter, the more humanoid monster designs, and symbolic holes, were incorporated into the game. \n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" received critical acclaim. Within the month of its release in North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies were sold, with the greatest number of sales in North America. It is often considered to be one of the greatest horror games ever made and among the greatest video games of all time, praised for its story, use of metaphors, symbolism, psychological horror and taboo topics, soundtrack, atmosphere, graphics, monster designs, and sound design. However, it received criticism for its controls despite their improvement over the previous game's. The game was followed by \"Silent Hill 3\" in 2003.\n\nThe objective of \"Silent Hill 2\" is to guide player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he searches for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for \"Silent Hill 2\" has James moving in the direction that he is facing when the player tilts the analog stick upwards. \"Silent Hill 2\" does not use a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, which can only be read if there is sufficient light or when his flashlight is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference.\n\nMuch of the gameplay consists of navigating the town and finding keys or other items to bypass doors or other obstructions, with less focus on killing enemies. Occasionally puzzles will be presented, often with riddles left for the player to interpret. The difficulty levels of the enemies and the puzzles are determined independently by the player before starting the game. James keeps a radio with him, which alerts him to the presence of creatures by emitting static, allowing him to detect them even through the thick fog. He also tilts his head in the direction of a nearby item or monster. For combat, he finds three melee weapons and three firearms over the course of the game, with another two melee weapons unlocked during replays. \"Health\" restoratives and ammunition can be found throughout the game. \n\nWhile not focusing on the characters and plot threads of the first \"Silent Hill\" game, \"Silent Hill 2\" takes place in the series' namesake town, located in the northeastern United States. \"Silent Hill 2\" is set in another area of the town, and explores some of Silent Hill's backstory. The town draws upon the psyche of its visitors and ultimately forms alternative versions of the town, which differ depending on the character. The concept behind the town was \"a small, rural town in America\"; to make the setting more realistic, some buildings and rooms lack furnishings.\n\nJames Sunderland (Guy Cihi) comes to Silent Hill after apparently receiving a letter from his wife Mary (Monica Taylor Horgan), who died of an illness three years before. While exploring the town, he encounters Angela Orosco (Donna Burke), a teenage runaway searching for her mother; Eddie Dombrowski (David Schaufele), another teenage runaway; and Laura (Jacquelyn Brekenridge), an eight-year-old who befriended Mary and accuses James of not truly loving her. James searches a local park, where he meets Maria (Horgan), who strongly resembles Mary but has a much more aggressive personality. Maria claims that she has never met or seen Mary, and because she is frightened by the monsters, James allows her to follow him.\n\nFollowing Laura to a hospital and searching for her there at Maria's insistence, James and Maria are ambushed by the monster Pyramid Head, and Maria is killed while James escapes. James resolves to search the hotel that he and Mary stayed at during their vacation. On the way, James finds Maria alive and unharmed in a locked room. She claims ignorance of their previous encounter and discusses elements of James' and Mary's past that only Mary would know. James sets off to find a way to free Maria but returns to find her dead again. Later on, he rescues Angela from a monster; she confesses that her father sexually abused her, and a newspaper clipping implies she killed him in self-defense before coming to Silent Hill. He also confronts Eddie, who admits to maiming a bully, and killing a dog, before fleeing to Silent Hill. When Eddie attacks him, James kills him in self-defense.\n\nAt the hotel, James locates a videotape which depicts him euthanizing his dying wife, and Mary's letter becomes a blank piece of paper. In another room, a final meeting with Angela sees her giving up on life, unable to cope with her trauma. She walks into a fire and is not seen again. Afterwards, James encounters two Pyramid Heads, along with Maria, who is killed again. James realizes that Pyramid Head was created because he needed someone to punish him, and all the monsters are manifestations of his psyche. The envelope from Mary disappears and both Pyramid Heads commit suicide. James heads to the hotel's rooftop; depending on choices made by the player throughout the game, he encounters either Mary or Maria disguised as her.\n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" features six endings; Konami has kept their canonicity ambiguous. In \"Leave\", James has one last meeting with Mary, reads her letter, and leaves the town with Laura. In \"Water\" sees James commit suicide by driving his car off a cliff. The \"Maria\" ending sees Mary as the woman on the rooftop, who has not forgiven James for killing her; after her defeat, James dismisses her as a hallucination and then leaves the town with an alive Maria, who briefly coughs, suggesting she will become sick just as Mary did, and the cycle will repeat. The other three endings are only available in replay games, including \"Rebirth\", in which James plans to resurrect Mary using arcane objects collected throughout the game, and two joke endings: \"Dog\", where James discovers that a dog has been controlling all the events of the game, and \"UFO\", where James is abducted by extraterrestrials with the help of the first game's protagonist, Harry Mason.\n\n\"Born from a Wish\" is a side-story scenario in the special editions and re-releases of the game in which the player takes control of Maria shortly before she and James meet at Silent Hill. After waking up in the town with a gun and contemplating suicide, she resolves to find someone. She eventually encounters a local mansion, where she hears the voice of its owner, Ernest Baldwin. Ernest refuses to let Maria into the room he is in and will only talk to her through its closed door. After Maria completes tasks for him, Ernest warns her about James, whom he describes as a \"bad man\". After Maria opens the door to Ernest's room and finds it empty, she leaves the mansion. At the conclusion of the scenario, Maria contemplates suicide once more, but ultimately resolves to find James.\n\nDevelopment of \"Silent Hill 2\" began in June 1999, directly after the completion of its predecessor. The game was created by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The story was conceived by CGI director Takayoshi Sato, who based it on Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel \"Crime and Punishment\" (1866), with individual members of the team collaborating on the actual scenario. The main writing was done by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato, who provided the dialog for the female characters. Around the time \"Silent Hill 2\" was in production, the average budget for video game production has been estimated to be around US$7–10 million by Sato. The decision to produce a sequel to \"Silent Hill\" was partly a financial one, as it had been commercially successful, and partly a creative one, as the team had faced difficulties while working on the original game. The team was given a small window to settle on a platform. As it was unable to gather information on the then-unannounced GameCube and Xbox consoles, they began production of the game for the PlayStation 2. Producer Akihiro Imamura stated that the decision was also influenced by \"a wish from the business section that we move rapidly on the PS2. You know, it is currently the market focus\". Imamura read all comments about the original game and kept them in mind while working on \"Silent Hill 2\". He estimated that a total of fifty people worked on the game: while the creative team from the first game remained, they had to bring in thirty people from Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. Developed at the same time, the PlayStation 2 version of \"Silent Hill 2\" and its Xbox port debuted at the March 2001 Tokyo Game Show to positive reactions.\n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" shared the same atmosphere of psychological horror as the first \"Silent Hill\" game. As the developers already had a rough sense of the game's environment, they focused on its plot first, in contrast to the process used with the first game. The PlayStation 2 hardware allowed the developers to create improved fog and shadow special effects. For example, as a monster approaches the player character, its shadow cast on the wall by the flashlight grows. When dealing with the game's camera angles, the team struggled with a balance between those that stayed true to the creative vision and those that did not hamper gameplay. Psychological elements, such as the gradual disappearance of Mary's letter and symbolic holes, were incorporated into the game. The team wanted \"Silent Hill 2\"s protagonist to \"reflect [the] evil,\" against which the protagonist of the first game battles.\n\nFor the game's artistic style, the team drew on a variety of influences: the work of film directors David Cronenberg, David Fincher, David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock, along with films similar to the 1990 psychological thriller/horror film \"Jacob's Ladder\", and painters such as Francis Bacon, Rembrandt and Andrew Wyeth. Early in the project, they studied the 1996 video game \"Tomb Raider\"s creation of 3D environments. Other influences on the game included the 1992 survival horror video game \"Alone in the Dark\", the first \"Silent Hill\" game, and the Japanese comic \"Whirr\" by Morohashi. While working on the character designs, Sato and his team sketched human faces and various expressions. To gain a better sense of the characters' facial structures, they drew the characters' profiles from various angles, before creating wire-frame models, each consisting of six thousand polygons; they then completed the model with textures. Data for the character animation was taken through motion capture, and using Softimage, they animated the characters. Masahiro Ito designed the monsters in \"Silent Hill 2\"; \"soured flesh\" was the concept behind their appearance. The monsters were also to incorporate \"an element of humanity\". For the most part, the monsters reflect the protagonist's subconscious. For example, the monster Pyramid Head was based on the executioners of the town's fictional history and is intended to be a punisher for James. Two exceptions to this theme are the \"Abstract Daddy\", a reflection of Angela's subconscious and memories, and the \"Creepers\", which are also seen in the first game.\n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" also incorporates some references to real-life events. In the original scenario, the developers designed Maria and James with dual personalities: Maria's other personality was \"Mary\", a reference to Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the Ripper's last victim, while James' was \"Joseph\", a reference to one of the Jack the Ripper suspects. Eddie Dombrowski's name was taken from actor Eddie Murphy during the beginning phases of production when Eddie was originally designed with a pleasantly optimistic personality. The name of Angela Orosco was derived from Angela Bennett, the name of the protagonist in the 1995 film \"The Net\", and Laura's from the 1970 novel \"No Language But a Cry\" by Richard D'Ambrosio. The developers satirized the perceived accessibility of guns in the United States by allowing James to find a handgun in a shopping cart. There are also indications that the layout of Silent Hill was based to a certain extent on the town of San Bruno, California.\n\nAkira Yamaoka composed the music for \"Silent Hill 2\". At his home, Yamaoka took three days to write the music for \"Theme of Laura\", \"Silent Hill 2\"s main theme, by combining \"a sad melody\" and \"a strong beat\", although he does not consider the melody to be the \"most important\" element of a musical piece. He wanted the music to evoke emotions in the player. \"Silent Hill 2\" makes extensive use of sound effects ranging from screams to footsteps on broken glass. In charge of the game's fifty sound effects, Yamaoka wanted to surprise the player with different sounds and create an unsettling environment. He also incorporated occasional silence, commenting that \"selecting moments of silence is another way of producing sound\". \n\nKonami published \"Silent Hill 2 Original Soundtracks\" in Japan on October 3, 2001. Eight tracks (\"Theme of Laura\", \"Null Moon\", \"Love Psalm\", \"True\", \"Promise\", \"Fermata in Mistic Air\", \"Laura Plays the Piano\" and \"Overdose Delusion\") appeared in the 2006 PlayStation Portable release \"The Silent Hill Experience\". At the 2006 Play! A Video Game Symphony concert in Chicago, Illinois, Yamaoka performed music from the series, including \"Theme of Laura\", with a full-size orchestra. In 2019, the soundtrack was rereleased on vinyl by Mondo, who previously gave the same treatment to the soundtrack of \"Silent Hill\" in 2016.\n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" was first released for the PlayStation 2 in North America on September 24, 2001, in Japan on September 27, 2001, and in Europe on November 23, 2001. The original European edition also included a second disc: a \"Making-of\" DVD video featuring trailers, an artwork gallery and a documentary on the game's development.\n\nAn extended version of the game was published for Xbox in North America on December 20, 2001, Japan on February 22, 2002, and Europe on October 14, 2002. Each region had a different subtitles for the game: in Japan, \"Restless Dreams\" in North America, and \"Inner Fears\" in Europe. This edition contained the short bonus scenario, \"Born from a Wish\" and other minor enhancements. This revised version was ported back to the PlayStation 2 and subtitled \"Director's Cut\" in Europe, but was not subtitled in North America, and was simply released under the \"Greatest Hits\" banner. Creature Labs ported this edition to Windows, which Konami released in December 2002. Added features in the PC version include the ability to quicksave and watch trailers for \"Silent Hill 3\".\n\nIn 2006, Konami re-released the extended version of \"Silent Hill 2\" with its indirect PS2 sequels, \"Silent Hill 3\" and \"\", in a bundle entitled \"The Silent Hill Collection\" in Europe and Japan. \"Silent Hill HD Collection\", a compilation of remastered high-definition editions of \"Silent Hill 2\" and \"3\", was released for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 20, 2012. It contains new voice actors for the characters of both games, along with the option in \"Silent Hill 2\" to listen to the original ones.\n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" received critical acclaim, selling over one million copies in the month of its release in North America, Japan and Europe, with the most units sold in North America. Rating aggregation site Metacritic shows an average rating of 89 out of 100 for the PS2 version, 84 out of 100 for the Xbox version, and 70 out of 100 for the PC version.\n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" received praise from video game journalists at the time of its release and in retrospect. Andy Greenwald of \"Spin\" magazine praised it as a frightening but \"restrained\" game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: \"\"Silent Hill 2\" feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel.\" IGN's Doug Perry wrote: \"It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's all I really want in a survival horror game.\" Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, \"\"Silent Hill 2\" is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original.\" In \"\" (2010), Tristian Donovan described \"Silent Hill 2\" as the \"high point\" of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as \"one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day\". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the \"short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games\". Online game critic for \"The Escapist Magazine\" Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, \"Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay every now and again to remind myself that for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending,\" and that \"It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied.\"\n\nThe graphics and atmosphere of \"Silent Hill 2\" were praised by reviewers, who highlighted the smooth transitions from computer-generated (CG) to in-game cutscenes and the sense of claustrophobia caused by the fog. On the other hand, Thompson felt that the grainy image effects and dense fog hid the details of the environment, while Fielder wrote that the exterior environments \"rarely push the PlayStation 2's graphical capabilities\". Character animation was considered realistic by reviewers, though James' animation in the CG sometimes appeared \"marionette\"-like, according to Perry. The voice acting garnered mixed responses from reviewers divided over whether it was well done with an improved script, or hampered by the script. Reviewers enjoyed the monster designs, although some found the monsters less frightening due to the abundance of ammunition, and being easily avoided. Reviewers found the camera, though improved, still difficult when battling monsters which hung from the ceiling—concerns echoed by reviewers of the PC version. The soundtrack and sound effects were considered by reviewers to be effective in creating suspense, though Thompson considered them sometimes \"a bit forced and contrived\". The puzzles were generally seen as not overly challenging by reviewers, though Thompson found them generally easy and GameSpy's David Hodgeson wrote that they were sometimes illogical. Less well-received was the combat, criticized for its lack of challenge and easily defeated monsters and bosses.\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"It's not for the faint of heart, nor anyone looking for fast action, but those who enjoy a good shiver won't be disappointed.\"\n\nReactions to the Xbox port were also positive. Reviewers have written that the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were mostly similar, except for the \"Born from a Wish\" side-scenario found in the Xbox version. \"Eurogamer\"s Kristan Reed called \"Born from a Wish\" \"more like a demo than anything\", while Fielder described it as \"a commendable extra\". Both felt that it could be completed in around an hour and did not add much to the game. The PC port, in contrast, received mixed reaction. Allen Rausch of GameSpy considered the PC port overall to be \"[a] fantastic translation of Konami's stylish and scary survival-horror game\". IGN's Ivan Sulic advised against playing the game with the keyboard, and rated the game \"great\". Conversely, Ron Dulin, another reviewer for GameSpot, wrote: \"Not even the game's foggy atmosphere is thick enough to hide \"Silent Hill 2\"s problems.\"\n\n\"Silent Hill 2\" is often considered to be among one of the best video games for its narrative. It ranked first on X-Play's list of the scariest games of all time in 2006. In 2009, IGN listed it as one of the five best horror video games created after 2000, and one of the twelve greatest PlayStation 2 games of all time. It ranked again in IGN's list of the top 100 PS2 games, and again in 2018, on IGN's list of the 100 greatest video games ever made. In a retrospective by \"GamePro\", it was the 26th best game for the PS2. In 2008, GamesRadar placed it on its list of the 15 best \"videogame stories\" ever, describing it as \"a punishing tale not easily matched\". In 2009, \"Wired News\" listed it as the 11th most influential game of the decade for its emphasis on psychological horror and exploration of taboo topics such as incest and domestic abuse, rather than gore. In 2012, a top video games of all-time list by G4 television network ranked the game in 85th place. That same year, the game's narrative was ranked first on GamesRadar's list of The Best Videogame Stories Ever. \"Silent Hill 2\" was listed as the number two top horror game of all time in the October 2014 issue of \"Game Informer\", and number eight on GameTrailers's Top Ten Twos list of the best second franchise games in 2015.\n"}

{"id": "1955739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955739", "title": "Here Comes Your Man", "text": "Here Comes Your Man\n\n\"Here Comes Your Man\" is a song by the American alternative rock band Pixies, written and sung by the band's frontman Black Francis. Produced by Gil Norton, it was released as the second single from the group's second album \"Doolittle\" in June 1989.\n\nWritten by Black Francis as a teenager, \"Here Comes Your Man\" was recorded for the band's 1987 demo tape, but not included on either \"Come On Pilgrim\" or \"Surfer Rosa\", as the songwriter was reluctant about releasing the song. Critics saw \"Here Comes Your Man\" as the Pixies' breakthrough song; Jon Dolan of \"Spin\" magazine commented that it was \"the most accessible song ever by an underground-type band.\" The song reached number three on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. In 2019, the single was certified Gold in Canada.\n\nBlack Francis recalled that he wrote \"Here Comes Your Man\" around the time he was age 14 or 15. Years later after the Pixies were formed, producer Paul Kolderie noted the group didn't want to record \"Here Comes Your Man\" for its demo \"The Purple Tape\". The group referred to it as \"the Tom Petty song\", according to Kolderie. Producer Gary Smith said, \"There was some reluctance to do 'Here Comes Your Man' because it was too pop, there was something too straight about it.\" When 4AD label head Ivo Watts-Russell handpicked the track listing for the group's debut release \"Come on Pilgrim\", he intentionally left out \"Here Comes Your Man\". Watts-Russell stated that he liked the song, but \"it felt just too obviously commercial and I didn't know what we were doing with [the band]\". Watts-Russell also felt it was too reminiscent of Mink DeVille's \"Spanish Stroll\". For a post-\"Surfer Rosa\" single, 4AD rejected another recording of the song; they later chose \"Gigantic\", with \"River Euphrates\" on the B-side.\n\nFrancis reflected in 2004 that during the recording of the group's second album \"Doolittle\" he felt embarrassed by \"Here Comes Your Man\", but since producer Gil Norton really liked the song, the songwriter \"threw him a bone\". Norton recorded the band performing the song's backing track when Black Francis was not available. The song featured a different arrangement from previous recordings of the track, and Black Francis added another verse to it.\n\n\"Here Comes Your Man\" opens with the Hendrix chord, favored by Pixies guitarist Joey Santiago and used on \"Tame\". The acoustic guitar plays a D–G–A chord progression, while Santiago plays a guitar riff which is the result of him double-tracking a 12-string Rickenbacker and a Telecaster.\n\nIn an interview with \"NME\", Francis commented on the meaning of the song:\n\nThe word \"boxcar\" was apparently a starting point for the song's lyrics, and Francis has suggested that this was in part inspired by the song \"Carnival of Sorts (Box Car)\" by R.E.M.: \"I probably liked the word 'boxcar' because I heard it on the R.E.M. song, from their first record.\"\n\nA music video, co-directed by Neil Pollock and Jonathan Bekemeier, to promote the single shows the band playing its instruments through a distorted fish-eye lens, the camera variously panning horizontally across the performance space and vertically over the individual band members. Keeping in the spirit of the mimed performance, Francis and bassist Kim Deal open and shut their mouths in time with their prerecorded vocals, yet make no attempt to articulate their lips in synch with the words that they are supposed to be singing. Instead, they simply keep their mouths wide open with blank expressions for the duration of each verse. Francis stated that \"Water on the brain\" was the theme of the clip.\n\n\"Here Comes Your Man\" was released as a single in June 1989, and the song's music video received some airplay on MTV. The cover image, chosen by Francis, comes from a photograph cover designer Simon Larbalestier took of a bulldog terrier for a gallery showing. The Pixies rarely played \"Here Comes Your Man\" at concerts or at promotional events. Music writer Ben Sisario described this stance as \"vintage college-rock 'tude--the hit, the pop song, should be avoided as inauthentic, while the aggro, anticommercial song represents legitimacy.\" Ivo Watts-Russell stated if Black Francis had been possibly persuaded to release the version of the song recorded during the session for the \"Gigantic\" single—which he described as \"totally streamlined and ready for radio\"—that \"maybe if a major label company was able to convince people to take a more commercial route, maybe Pixies would have sold a whole bunch more records than they did. But those steps were just not required back in 1989\". The song reached number three on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nJoey Santiago later recalled: \"The tour manager asked, 'Hey, Arsenio Hall wants you to come on the show.' We said, 'Well, what do they want to hear?' He said, 'Here Comes Your Man.' No way. We told them we would love to go on, only if we did the song 'Tame'. And they said, 'No, thank you.'\"\n\nThe song makes an appearance in indie rom-com \"(500) Days of Summer\", where it is sung by the main character Tom Hansen in a karaoke bar, and \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Hardly Kirk-ing\" as well as \"Say It Isn't So\", \"\", and \"Daddy's Home\". It also appeared in Episode 9 as well as Episode 10 of Mr. Mercedes.\nThe song was featured in a Citi commercial in 2017.\nThe song also made an appearance on the June 11th 2018 episode of the BBC magazine show The One Show playing over a montage of popular entertainer Michael Crawford's career\n\nAll songs written by Black Francis.\n\n\n"}

It partly encircles the city of Guelph, surrounding it in a continuous arc from approximately northeast to south-southwest of the city. It is part of the Guelph census metropolitan area.\n\nThe township was created in 1999 by the merger of the townships of Guelph and Eramosa, as well as parts of Pilkington and Nichol Townships. The name Eramosa was derived from the native word \"Un-ne-mo-sah\" (possibly meaning \"black dog\", \"dead dog\", or simply \"dog\"). Eramosa Township was settled primarily by Scots and Irish; in 1841, its population was 935.\n\nThe mayor of Guelph/Eramosa in 2018 is Christopher White (since 2010). Township councillors are Bruce Dickieson, Corey Woods, Louise Marshall and Mark Bouwmeester. County councillors are Don McKay and Doug Breen.\n\nNow a major auto parts manufacturer with 22 plants in Guelph, Linamar was started in the village of Ariss in 1964 by Hungarian refugee Frank Hasenfratz, initially in his basement. The company, with a staff of five, was incorporated in 1966 as Linamar Machine Limited. Linamar's first major contract was to manufacture automotive oil pumps for Ford.\n\nGuelph/Eramosa is governed by a mayor and four councillors, with one councillor representing each of the four municipal wards. The Mayor of Guelph/Eramosa represents the town on the Wellington County Council. As of the 2018 election, the elected council members are:\n\nMayor: Chris White\n\nCouncillors:\n\n\nRockwood is the main community in the township. Rockwood is located on Highway 7 between Acton and the city of Guelph. The Eramosa River runs through the centre of the village and is the reason for Rockwood's existence – having been the source of power for several mills that were the economic engine that spawned the original settlement. Limestone was also extracted from what is now the nearby Rockwood Conservation Area at that time. The conservation area is used for swimming, hiking, canoeing, picnicking and camping from last Friday in April to the Sunday following Thanksgiving and it has over 65,000 visitors a year. The conservation area features a small reservoir on the Eramosa River, karst formations, and caves.\n\nIn addition to Rockwood, the township also includes the smaller communities of Ariss, Armstrong Mills, Birge Mills, Brucedale, Centre Inn, Eden Mills, Eramosa, Everton, Marden, Mosborough, Redwood Hills, and Rockcut.\n\nThe area was settled by the Attawandaron Nation, also known as the Neutrals in the 1600s and the territory was held by the Mississauga of the Credit; the latter sold a large tract of land to the government in 1818 and it was first surveyed that year; the name Eramosa was then used to describe the large parcel of land.\n\nOne small area was named Eden Mills in 1846 by Adam Argo who had built a mill there. Over the years, the hamlet had a grist mill, an oatmeal mill and several saw mills powered by the Eramosa River. Other businesses also thrived and there was a stop for the Toronto Suburban railway (later becoming the Edgewood Camp) which ran from Toronto to Guelph. As recently as 1950, two churches and a school (SS#11) operated in the hamlet. The population of the hamlet in early 2019 was 350.\n\nGreat Northern Railway founder James J. Hill was born in Rockwood in 1838.\n\nPopulation data prior to amalgamation (1999):\n\nGuelph/Eramosa is covered by local newspapers and television through the following services:\n\nGuelph/Eramosa township contains three public elementary schools administered by the Upper Grand District School Board.

Montreal Manic was brought back in 2020 by Canadians Gary Gaul and Jonathan Daoust. The Montreal Manic are an academy with boys and girls from U8 - U18\n\n\"Le Manic\" as they were called by the locals, were Montreal's first professional soccer team since the NASL's Montreal Olympique folded in 1973. The team was named after a river in northeast Quebec, the Manicouagan, the site of a massive hydroelectric project.\n\nThe Montreal Manic competed from 1981 to 1983, with their home field being the Montreal Olympic Stadium. Previous to Montreal, the team played as the Philadelphia Fury from 1978 through 1980 and ten Fury players as well as manager Eddie Firmani moved to Montreal for 1981.\n\nAfter defeating the Los Angeles Aztecs in the first round of the 1981 NASL playoffs, the Manic faced the Chicago Sting.\nA 58,542 Olympic Stadium crowd saw the Manic defeat the Sting in the opening match before the series shifted to Chicago where the Manic lost twice and were eliminated. In 1982 the Manic performed better in the regular season than in 1981, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers and Firmani was fired.\n\nIn 1983 the interest in the team and the average attendance fell sharply. The Manic's opening home match in 1983 versus the Tampa Bay Rowdies was witnessed by just 6,460 fans.\nHowever, in their final season, the Manic produced one of the great shocks in NASL history by eliminating the New York Cosmos in the quarterfinals of the 1983 playoffs, winning the first match away 4-2 and winning the second match at home in a shootout. The Manic then lost to the Tulsa Roughnecks in the next round.\n\nIn the 1983 season, the Manic hosted Nottingham Forest (a 4-3 extra time loss) and FC Nantes (a 2-1 shootout victory for Montreal) at the Olympic Stadium.\n\nIn his book, \"Soccer in a Football World\", North American soccer historian Dave Wangerin partially attributes the downfall of the Manic organization to the Molson ownership's declaration to attempt to build a Team Canada roster for the 1984 season. The new direction of the team meant many of the team's players who originated from foreign countries would be let go, to emphasize an all Canadian roster instead. Given that Canada had a relatively poor track record at producing world class soccer talent, Montreal fans were likely put off by the prospect that the quality of the team's play would instantly diminish for the 1984 season.\nMore importantly, the team was allegedly in financial trouble despite the fact that the Manic had some of the highest attendances in the NASL. Reports indicated that during the first two seasons, the Manic lacked profitability as they had lost $7 million. Manic president Roger Samson blamed the losses on bad stadium deals, high rents, having the concession profits going directly to the Montreal Expos, a lack of a television deal, and that an average attendance of over 20,000 was insufficient to keep the franchise solvent.\n\nNASL Championships\n\nNASL Indoor Championships\n\nDivision titles\n\nIndoor Leading Goal Scorer\n\nIndoor Leading Goalkeeper\n\nIndoor Tournament Defensive MVP\n\nAll-Star First Team Selections\n\nAll-Star Second Team Selections\n\nIndoor All-Stars\nCanadian Soccer Hall of Fame\n\nU.S. Soccer Hall of Fame\n\nIndoor Soccer Hall of Fame\n\n\n\n"}

They played in the North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1978 to 1980. Their home venues for outdoor play were Schaefer Stadium (1978 and 1980) and Nickerson Field (1979). They also played one season of indoor soccer in the NASL, using the Providence Civic Center for home games.\n\nThe Tea Men were originally owned by Unilever's Lipton subsidiary and given their unusual name as a nod to both the company's product line and the Boston Tea Party.\n\nThe Tea Men won their division in 1978 and made a further playoff run in 1980. However, the team struggled for financial solvency in Massachusetts. Right at the start of the 1980–81 indoor season they relocated to Jacksonville, Florida and became the Jacksonville Tea Men.\n\nLed in its initial season by former Charlton Athletic F.C. striker Mike Flanagan, the Tea Men won their division to much public acclaim, with Flanagan winning the league MVP award. \n\nSubsequent seasons proved not as successful for two important reasons. First, Flanagan, contracted to Charlton, remained in England (an attempt to secure him via a transfer failed, reportedly over endorsement rights). Second, the team was temporarily evicted from Schaefer Stadium when the owners of Foxboro Raceway - located next door - claimed that the Tea Men's matches were causing traffic problems on racing dates. \n\nAfter spending one unhappy season at Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University, the team reached an accord with Foxboro Raceway to play in Foxboro, but not on racing dates.

He drove with occasional success in these series for the better part of 14 years. The highlight during this time was 3 victories at Vermont's Thunder Road International SpeedBowl in its famous \"Milk Bowl\" race in 1985, 1989 and 1993.\n\nLepage made his Busch Series debut in 1986 at Oxford Plains Speedway, starting 41st and finishing 15th in the No. 09 Buick owned by Carl Merrill. He became a Busch Series regular in 1994, serving as an owner/driver in the No. 71 Vermont Teddy Bear Company car and running for Rookie of the Year honors. He had a best finish of 9th at New Hampshire International Speedway, in which he got a flat tire at the very end of the race, and finished 24th in points. The 1995 season resulted in five Top 10s and finishing 18th in points. At the end of the season, he lost his sponsorship and ran his own car in 1996 unsponsored until April. Lepage then joined David Ridling and his No. 88 Ridling Motorsports team with sponsorship from Ridling's own Farmer's Choice Fertilizer. He won his first career race at the season finale Jiffy Lube Miami 300 with Hype Energy sponsorship. He finished eighth in points with 1 win, three Top 5s and 10 Top 10s. He ran most of the 1997 season driving for Ridling before leaving due to the team losing its sponsor. Lepage would finish out the year running for Phoenix Racing and ST Motorsports. He finished 12th in points, posting three Top 5s and six Top 10s. Lepage had his Cup debut by qualifying for the Fall Charlotte race in the No. 91 LJ Racing car in an impressive 12th. He would also run the Fall Talladega and Atlanta races with finishes of 17th at Talladega and 29th at Atlanta.\n\nLepage made the move to Winston Cup in 1998, driving for the LJ Racing team. Despite the team's lack of sponsorship, Lepage posted two fourteenth-place finishes, catching the eye of Jack Roush, owner of Roush Racing. Lepage announced his decision to depart LJ Racing in late June 1998 and sat out 6 races to work out the details of the new contract with Roush. He would drive the No. 16 Primestar-sponsored Ford Taurus in place of Ted Musgrave, who was released after Lepage's hiring. He earned a pair of top-10 finishes in 13 races for Roush, his best finish being a sixth place at Charlotte. Despite missing several races, he nearly won the 1998 Rookie of the Year title. Lepage also drove in the Busch Series for Doug Taylor's No. 40 team with sponsorship from Channellock. Lepage finished 14th in points despite only starting 24 races out of 31. Lepage won his second career race at the August Food City 250 at Bristol and won his first career pole at the June MBNA Platinum 200 at Dover. He finished the year with one win, six Top 5s and 10 Top 10s.\n\nLepage returned in 1999 with sponsorship from Primestar which switched to TV Guide in April after Primestar was sold to the General Motors-owned DirectTV. He had one top 5, two top-tens and won the pole at the season-ending NAPA 500, earning him a 25th-place points finish. The highlight of the season was a 5th-place finish in the Southern 500 which qualified him for the Winston No Bull 5 at Talladega. Lepage also ran in the Busch Series driving the No. 99 J&J Racing/Brewco Motorsports car with a sponsorship from Red Man. He finished 35th in points with 14 starts, two Top 5s and six Top 10s.\n\nHe began 2000 unsponsored, before picking up backing from FamilyClick.com. He failed to qualify twice and finished 28th in points with one Top 5 and three Top 10s with a best finish of 5th at Texas. At the end of the year, FamilyClick ended its backing and Roush closed the 16 team. That season Lepage restarted his No. 71 Busch team as Matrix Motorsports with sponsorship from Red Man, Southern Pride Chewing Tobacco and State Fair Corn Dogs. He finished 42nd in points with 10 starts, one Top 5 and two Top 10s with a best finish of 3rd at Atlanta.\n\nIn 2001 Lepage returned to the Busch Series to run his own team, Matrix Motorsports, driving the No. 71 State Fair Corn Dogs/Ball Park Franks Ford. Running 15 races, he had one top-five (3rd at Fontana), four top-tens and a pole at Kansas Speedway. In addition to those races he drove for Phoenix Racing at Loudon (Finished 35th). His team also won the pole (Finished 8th) at Watkins Glen with Scott Pruett. He also returned to the Cup series, running the No. 4 Kodak Chevrolet for Morgan-McClure Motorsports, replacing Robby Gordon after five races. Lepage had a best finish of 11th (Texas) in 21 races with them. Late in the season, he switched to the No. 7 Nations Rent Ultra Motorsports Ford, posting a tenth-place finish at Talladega Superspeedway. Despite missing seven races, Lepage ended up 36th in points.\n\nEarly in 2002, Lepage's team went inactive due to a lack of sponsorship, even though he had an 8th at Daytona and a 4th at Las Vegas. He soon joined Brewco Motorsports, driving their No. 37 Timber Wolf Chevy. In 24 starts that year, he had six top-tens and two poles, finishing 25th in points. He also ran three Cup races, two in the No. 38 Quest Motor Racing Ford, and another for BAM Racing at Talladega in a car sponsored by Billy Ray Cyrus's show \"Doc\". His best finish that year was a 40th at Loudon.\n\nIn 2003, Lepage ran his own team at the Cup level for one race, finishing 32nd at the Coca-Cola 600 along with the Winston Open. He ran two races that year for CLR Racing, where he had a fourth place start at Michigan, before returning to Morgan-McClure to finish the year, his best finish a fourteenth at Atlanta. He teamed with Morgan-McClure again in 2004, but after six races, Lepage departed due to a lack of sponsorship. He then signed with Competitive Edge Motorsports, posting a best finish of 41st twice, before leaving the team. He ended the season with R&J Racing, where he had a best finish of 27th at Phoenix International Raceway. He also ran eleven races in the Busch Series for MacDonald Motorsports, where he had two top-fifteen finishes.\n\nIn 2005, Lepage returned to R&J, and started the season off with a third-place finish in the Gatorade Duels and a ninth-place finish at the Daytona 500. Unfortunately, the closest Lepage came to another top 10 was a 12th-place finish at Lowe's Motor Speedway in the Coca-Cola 600, and was released from the ride after the Brickyard 400. He signed with Peak Performance Racing for the balance of the year, and had a sixth-place qualifying effort at Kansas. He finished the season 39th in points. He also ran six races with MacDonald in the Busch Series as well, posting a ninth-place finish at Lowe's. That year, Lepage made his debut in the Craftsman Truck Series for Green Light Racing at Dover finishing 19th.\n\nLepage returned to Peak for 2006, but due to a lack of funding, the team was sold to Front Row Motorsports in April. Lepage ran a couple of races for FRM before leaving for BAM Racing. He ran 12 races for BAM with a best finish of 21st at Bristol Motor Speedway before leaving them. Lepage then rejoined Front Row Motorsports making two of the final eight races in their No. 34 and No. 61 cars. He ended up 40th in points even with missing 14 races. He also ran a limited schedule in the Busch Series for Mac Hill Motorsports with a best finish of 19th in seven races. Lepage ran two races for Green Light Racing in the Craftsman Truck Series with a best finish of 21st at Michigan. At the end of the year, Lepage sold the remnants of Matrix Motorsports to start a lawn care business called Matrix Lawn and Landscaping.\n\nIn 2007, Lepage started the year driving the No. 34 Front Row Motorsports car in the races where the team could afford to run two cars. Starting in late April, Front Row would mainly run the No. 37 car with Lepage making most of the attempts. In 27 attempts, Lepage was only able to make two races; at Darlington and New Hampshire Motor Speedway. He also drove a part-time schedule for a few teams in the Busch Series including the No. 52 Means Racing Ford, as well as some additional races for Randy MacDonald and D.D.L. Motorsports with a best finish of 28th at Watkins Glen. Lepage also had two starts for Team Racing in the Craftsman Truck Series with a best finish of 35th at Texas.\n\nLepage returned to driving full-time in the Nationwide Series (formerly known as the Busch Series) in 2008, driving for Specialty Racing. While racing for Specialty, Lepage made one of the most controversial moves in the history of NASCAR at Talladega when he proceeded to pull off pit road and directly in front of the entire field which was bearing down on him at almost . Lepage blamed it on the spotter for every other team stating \"nobody recognized my car was damaged and vastly underpowered,\" but later apologized for the accident himself. Lepage was released by Specialty after the July Daytona race and was replaced by Brandon Whitt. The following race at Chicagoland, he failed to qualify a car brought by Front Row Motorsports. After he failed to qualify, Lepage drove the No. 52 Means Racing entry for Brad Teague in order to maintain his position in the driver's points. He then attempted to race at Gateway in Mike Harmon's No. 84 Chevrolet, but failed to qualify. Later in the season, he was hired to drive the No. 73 for Derrike Cope, and finished the season 28th in driver's points, despite missing 8 races. Lepage ran one Truck Series race at Homestead for Green Light Racing finishing 35th.\n\nHe began the 2009 season without a full-time ride, but after running Derrike Cope's No. 73 at Bristol, Lepage joined Jimmy Means' team at Texas in April until leaving after the June race at New Hampshire. He then joined Derrike Cope's team for the rest of the season at Chicago primarily driving the No. 78, but also occasionally driving the No. 73. Lepage also ran one race for Green Light Racing at Dover in the Camping World Truck Series finishing 33rd, his most recent start in that series to date.\n\nLepage announced on February 5, 2010, that he would be returning to Mac Hill Motorsports for the 2010 season with sponsorship from Revolucion World Wide/Start Energy Drink. Unfortunately the sponsorship deal fell through after four races and the team was forced to \"start and park\" races in order to keep costs down. Even with this measure, finances forced the team to start skipping races by mid year. The team partnered up with RaceDaySponsor.com in order to give local sponsors an opportunity to be a sponsor each week. This earned the team finances to get to the track, but not enough to run full races. When the Mac Hill team was unable to get to the track, Lepage got to run some races for No. 52 Jimmy Means Racing Chevrolet (made four out of five attempts) and No. 04 Davis Motorsports Chevrolet at Road America. Even with the limited finances, Lepage was able to make 25 out of 31 race attempts and ended up 40th in points.\n\nIn 2010, Lepage was in a Sprint Cup car for the first time since 2007. Lepage joined back up with Morgan-McClure Motorsports to run the Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol with sponsorship from Alpha Natural Resources/Joy Mining Machinery. Lepage was unable to qualify for the race.\n\nOn November 20, 2010, Mac Hill Motorsports announced that it was discontinuing its Nationwide Series team, allowing Lepage to seek another ride.\n\nOn January 10, 2011, Lepage announced that he would drive for Team Rensi Motorsports No. 24 team in the Nationwide Series, bringing sponsorship from RaceDaySponsor.com, marking the first time since 2008 that Lepage would run a full race distance. Not enough sponsorship was found and the team was forced to start and park four of the five races they ran. After the spring Texas race, they closed down. On April 26, Lepage announced that he would be joining Means Racing starting at Richmond and would work with the team to procure more sponsorship for the rest of the season. Sponsorship was found to allow Lepage to run 17 races without having to start and park, with a best finish of 20th at Phoenix. Lepage finished 27th in Points, which was his best finish since 2008.\nOn February 2012, Lepage announced that Race Day Sponsor.com and himself were no longer working together. Lepage wasn't able to start his season until securing a ride in the No. 28 Robinson-Blakeney Racing for the 4th and 5th races of the season at Bristol and California with a best finish of 31st at Bristol. That team shut down but Lepage was able to start and park the next weeks race at Texas with Mike Harmon Racing's No. 74. The next three weeks Lepage drove the No. 52 Means Racing car at Richmond, Talladega and Darlington with a best finish of 27th at Richmond. Lepage then substituted in Tri-Star Motorsports start and park No. 10 for the next 4 races highlighted by qualifying efforts of 25th at Dover and Michigan. After the sub job ended, Lepage start and parked for Means Racing at Kentucky. Lepage then joined the Deware Racing Group in their No. 86. In preparation for the 2013 season, the team ran a limited schedule of 9 of the final 17 races. Due to a lack of sponsorship the team start and parked 7 of the nine races, though with sponsorship from Qello at Bristol and Kengor Metals at Charlotte the team had finishes of 20th and 26th respectively. Lepage ended up 35th in points with only running 20 of 33 races.\n\nThe 2013 season started with the Deware Racing Group unable to secure sponsorship, which left them mostly inactive and Lepage starting the season without a ride. It took to the third race of season at Las Vegas for Lepage to get a ride with No. 74 Mike Harmon Racing for that race and weeks later at Texas with a best finish of 28th at Texas. Three weeks later, Lepage start and parked for Means Racing at Darlington. In June at Iowa, Lepage drove the No. 87 NEMCO Motorsports car in practice in preparation for owner/driver Joe Nemechek to arrive from Pocono Raceway to run the race. Due to the Iowa race being delayed a day cause of rain, Lepage got to drive the 87 to a 19th-place finish while Nemechek drove at Pocono. Lepage would finish the season start and parking the No. 74 in four races, failing to qualify the No. 86 at Bristol and running JD Motorsports's No. 4 car in races at Mid-Ohio and Kentucky with finishes of 20th and 19th respectively. Lepage ended up 39th in points with only running 10 of 33 races.\n\nLepage started the 2014 season without a ride. Starting with the third race of the season at Las Vegas, Lepage drove the No. 74 Mike Harmon Racing Dodge. He drove for them through the fifth race of the season at California with a best finish of 30th at California. Lepage joined JD Motorsports in their No. 87 for the next three races. His best finish was a 19th at Darlington, but the ride ended when the 87 team's only car was wrecked at Richmond. Lepage drove the 74 at Charlotte but finished 39th due to a rear gear failure. Lepage later drove start and park efforts for Tri-Star Motorsports at Michigan and JGL Racing at Elkhart Lake. Starting at Kentucky in June, Lepage drove the Mike Harmon Racing No. 74 at six race weekends until Richmond in September with a best finish of 33rd at New Hampshire to go with 2 DNQ's. Lepage would make his last career start with TriStar Motorsports at Dover finishing 31st. Lepage did attempt to qualify at Homestead with Mike Harmon Racing but failed to qualify.\n\nLepage was unable to find sponsorship to compete in NASCAR after the 2014 season and instead focused on his business interests. On March 21, 2017, Lepage announced he would run in the 55th Milk Bowl on October 1, 2017 at Thunder Road International SpeedBowl with Boyce Racing in what is hinted at as his final race. On August 23, 2017, Lepage announced State Water Heaters, Citgo, Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Allen Lumber and Shearer Chevrolet as the sponsors for his final race. Unfortunately for Lepage, he had to run the Last Chance qualifying race due to a slow qualifying speed. Due to a spin during that race, Lepage came up two positions short of being able to compete in the 55th Milk Bowl.\n\nLepage was born in Shelburne in Vermont on June 26, 1962. He was the only stock car driver from Vermont competing in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in the 1990s. Lepage is a practicing Catholic, which had a tremendous impact on how he raced others in his racing career.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

{"id": "1955767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955767", "title": "Hatari!", "text": "Hatari!\n\nHatari! (, Swahili for \"Danger!\") is a 1962 American adventure romantic comedy film directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne. It portrays a group of professional game catchers in Africa. The film includes dramatic wildlife chases and the scenic backdrop of Mount Meru, a dormant volcano.\n\n\"Hatari!\" was shot in Technicolor and filmed on location in northern Tanganyika (in what is now Tanzania). As of January 2020, Hardy Krüger is the last living principal cast member.\n\n\"Hatari!\" is the story of a group of adventurers in East Africa, engaged in the exciting and lucrative but dangerous business of catching wild animals for delivery to zoos around the world. As \"Momella Game Ltd.\", they operate from a compound near the town of Arusha. The head of the group is Sean Mercer (John Wayne); the others are safari veteran Little Wolf, also known as \"the Indian\" (Bruce Cabot); drivers \"Pockets\" (Red Buttons), a former Brooklyn taxi driver, and Kurt (Hardy Krüger), a German auto racing driver; roper Luis (Valentin de Vargas), a former Mexican bullfighter, and Brandy (Michele Girardon), a young woman whose late father was a member of the group; she grew up there and owns the business.\n\nTheir method (shown in several action sequences) is to chase the selected animal across the plains with a truck, driven by Pockets. Sean stands in the bed of the truck with a rope noose on a long pole, and snags the animal by its head. (For smaller animals, Sean rides in a seat mounted on the truck's left front fender.) A smaller, faster \"herding car,\" driven by Kurt, swings outside, driving the animal back toward the \"catching truck\". Once the animal is snagged, Luis, an expert roper, catches its legs and secures it. The animal is then moved into a travel crate and carried on a third truck, driven by Brandy. The captured animals are held in pens in the compound, tended by native workers, until they are shipped out at the end of the hunting season.\n\nIn the opening sequence, the team chases a rhinoceros, but it attacks the herding car and severely gores the Indian, who has to be transported to the Arusha hospital. While they are waiting to hear about the Indian's condition, a young Frenchman (Gerard Blain) approaches Sean about taking the Indian's job. This offends Kurt, who knocks the Frenchman down. Then Dr. Sanderson (Eduard Franz) says the Indian may die without a transfusion of rare type AB Negative blood. However, the Frenchman has that blood type. He agrees to donate his blood for the transfusion. The group returns to the compound after celebrating the Indian's survival.\n\nSean is surprised to find a strange woman sleeping in his bed, and a comedic exchange between Sean, Pockets, and Kurt ensues as they try to figure out what she's doing there. The next morning, she introduces herself as Anna Maria D'Alessandro (\"Just call me Dallas\") (Elsa Martinelli), a photojournalist sent by the Basel Zoo to record the capture of the animals they have ordered. Sean is annoyed, but under the contract with the zoo they must accommodate her. Dallas quickly makes friends with the others, especially Pockets. She rides along on the group's catching runs, snapping pictures.\n\nDallas is immediately attracted to Sean, and (she thinks) he to her, but he treats her brusquely. Pockets explains that a few years earlier, Sean was engaged to a woman who came to the compound, hated Sean's life there, and abruptly left him. Ever since, he distrusts women, especially those to whom he is attracted.\n\nThe young Frenchman comes to the compound and, after proving himself a crack shot, is hired to replace the Indian for the rest of the catching season. His name is Charles Maurey, but Sean dubs him \"Chips\". His job is to ride with Kurt in the herding car, carrying a rifle in case an animal attacks.\n\nThe Indian returns, and urges Sean to forego catching any rhinos this season. A \"nice Belgian kid\" was killed in an earlier rhino chase, as was Brandy's father; now the Indian was nearly killed. He suggests there is a jinx. Sean agrees only to postpone rhino to the end of the season.\n\nDallas makes some progress with Sean, but friction between them continues, especially after Dallas adopts first one, then two, and finally three orphaned elephant calves. This leads to her adoption into the local Warusha tribe as \"Mama Tembo\" (\"Mother of Elephants\").\n\nChips and Kurt flirt with Brandy, but as things turn out, it is Pockets Brandy falls for. This becomes clear to everyone on a day when the herding car flips over, dislocating Kurt's shoulder and cutting Chips up. Brandy doesn't react much to their injuries, but when Pockets falls off a fence and wrenches his back, she is nearly hysterical with worry over his \"injury.\"\n\nAnimal chases continue, with the group capturing a zebra, a giraffe, a gazelle, a buffalo, and a wildebeest. They also trap a leopard in a baited cage. When the herding car is mired during a river crossing, Chips shoots a crocodile that is threatening Kurt, and a strong friendship develops between them.\n\nPockets spends several days privately tinkering in the compound workshop. He invents a method of flinging a net over a tree full of monkeys, which the zoos want. His rocket-net (which Sean declares a \"Rube Goldberg machine\") is a success, catching over 500 of them.\n\nWith all other orders filled, the group catches a rhino without serious incident, and the Indian agrees that the jinx is broken. The group goes to Arusha to celebrate the end of the season, but Dallas declines to go along. She is frustrated, because though she has had some intimate moments with Sean, he has never clearly declared how he feels about her. When Sean urges her to join the group's excursion, she lashes out at him and bursts into tears, leaving him baffled.\n\nThe next morning, Dallas has vanished, leaving a farewell letter with Pockets. Sean and the group rush to Arusha to catch her. To help locate Dallas they take along Tembo, the first of Dallas's baby elephants, to track her by scent. Not wanting to be left behind, the other two follow the trucks to Arusha. The ensuing chase ends when the three baby elephants corner Dallas in a hotel lobby in town.\n\nIn the final scene, Dallas is again in Sean's bed when he enters the room, and they reprise the dialogue from their first meeting. As before, Pockets also comes in drunk and again asks Sean \"What is she doing in your bed?\" But this time, Sean announces \"We got married today!\" After Sean herds Pockets out of their room, Tembo and his two brothers push their way in and break Sean's bed as the newlyweds try to figure out how to deal with them.\n\n\n\n\"Hatari!\" has a very loose script and, like many other major works of Hawks, is principally structured on the relationships among the characters, though it is \"bookended\" by the initial violent (and nearly fatal) encounter with a rhinoceros and the end-of-season determination to make such a capture to fulfil the team's quota. The script was written by Hawks' favourite writer, Leigh Brackett, after the group returned from Africa with the catching scenes.\n\nMuch of the film revolves around scenes of chasing animals in jeeps and trucks across the African plains. The animals pursued are also all live, wild, and untrained. Capturing animals by chasing them down is banned today due to concerns of exhausting and killing the targeted animals. There is also the fact that, owing to the development of reliable animal tranquillisers and powerful dart guns in the decades since \"Hatari!\" was filmed, it's no longer necessary to lasso and rope the animals to capture them.\n\nAt the beginning of the production, all Hawks knew was that he wanted a movie about people who catch animals in Africa for zoos, a dangerous profession with exciting scenes the likes of which had never been seen on-screen before. Hawks increased his knowledge on animal catching from the work of the famous South African animal conservationist, Dr. Ian Player. In 1952 South Africa was eliminating all large wild animals to protect livestock, and only 300 white rhinos survived. Player then invented his famed rhino catching technique to relocate and save the white rhinos. Player's project was called \"Operation Rhino\" and it was recorded in the renowned documentary film of the same name. Hawks studied this film closely and incorporated aspects of it into his film.\n\nMichèle Girardon (Brandy) spoke no English when cast in the role; she taught herself English while on the set, according to a July 1961 \"LIFE\" magazine profile of the actress.\n\nGovernment-licensed animal catcher Willy de Beer was hired by Hawks to be the closeby technical adviser, and his assistants became their staff of experts in regard to catching the animals.\n\nHawks was inspired by the famous animal photographer Ylla, so he had script writer Brackett add the character of Dallas. Hawks said, \"We took that part of the story from a real character, a German girl. She was the best animal photographer in the world.\"\n\nFilming in Africa was dangerous for the production team and actors. According to director Howard Hawks all the animal captures in the picture were actually performed by the actors; no stuntmen or animal handlers were substituted on-screen. The rhino really did escape, and the actors really did have to recapture it - and Hawks included the sequence for its realism. Much of the action sequence audio had to be re-dubbed due to John Wayne's cursing while wrestling with the animals. However, a stand-in, \"Rusty\" Walkley (real name: Mildred Lucy Walkley), was used for some scenes involving Elsa Martinelli.\n\nHawks said Wayne admitted being scared during some of the action scenes, and \"had the feeling with every swerve that the car was going to overturn as he hung on for dear life, out in the open with only a seat belt for support, motor roaring, body jarring every which-way, animals kicking dirt and rocks and the thunder of hundreds of hooves increasing the din in his ears.\" Wayne felt it was unpredictable with the terrain's hidden holes and obstacles which could have been disastrous.\n\nJohn Wayne wore a belt with his famous Red River D buckle on it, as he did in many of his movies. It can be clearly seen in the scene where Sean Mercer calls Arusha Control after the Indian is gored by the rhino in the opening of the movie; and again in the scene where Sonja the cheetah wanders into the bathroom while Dallas is bathing and introduces herself by licking Dallas and purring.\n\nWhen Hawks interviewed de Vargas, he told him it would be very dangerous and showed him a documentary. De Vargas had no double and like the rest of the cast appeared in the animal catching shots. One evening Buttons and Wayne were playing cards outside and a leopard came out of the bush towards them. When Buttons mentioned the approaching leopard, Wayne said, \"See what he wants.\" De Vargas said technical adviser Willy de Beer was mauled by a loose baby leopard that sprang on him from a tree, \"He came back with his arm covered in bandages and throat completely wrapped, but he just shrugged it off.\" \n\nAs the animals frequently refused to make noise \"on cue\" (in particular, the baby elephants refused to trumpet inside populated areas), local Arusha game experts and zoo collectors were hired to do \"animal voice impersonations\".\n\nHawks stated in interviews that he had originally planned to star both Clark Gable and Wayne in the film until Gable's death finally ruled that out.\n\n\"Hatari!\" introduced the memorable Henry Mancini tune \"Baby Elephant Walk\". Another memorable musical moment is a duet of Stephen Foster's \"Old Folks at Home\" (Swanee River) with Dallas playing the piano, and Pockets playing the harmonica.\n\nNgorongoro farm, owned by Hardy Kruger from 1960 to 1973, served as the movie's setting.\n\n\"Hatari!\" grossed $12,923,077 at the box office, earning $7 million in US theatrical rentals. It was the 7th highest-grossing film of 1962.\n\nJean-Luc Godard listed \"Hatari!\" as one of the best films of its year of release.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\nMichael Milner adapted Leigh Brackett's screenplay into a paperback novel published by Pocket Books in 1962 as a tie-in to the movie. The cover features the movie poster of the rhino attacking the catching truck. The novel goes into more detail about some aspects of the animal-catching, particularly about Pockets' rocket net project, and about the pursuit of Brandy by Kurt, Chips, and Pockets. The book is a little edgier than the film, but it is a fast read and faithful to the movie. The novel's ASIN number is B000BJUQP4.\n\n\n"}

Following the NPSL's merger with the United Soccer Association to form the NASL in 1968, the Generals became the sole professional soccer team in New York City. The Generals played on season in the NASL before folding after the 1968 season. The New York Cosmos, founded in 1970, would take the Generals place as New York City's professional soccer team and shared both the Generals' colors and home stadium.\n\nFrom the founding of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL), New York City was considered was considered a market of immense importance to the league. According to soccer historian David Wagner, New York City's \"hugely influential media was likely to make or break the entire venture.\" The New York Generals were originally founded and owned by RKO General (which at the time also owned WOR-TV) and Wall Street investor Peter Elser. The team's gold and green color scheme was based on that of the Green Bay Packers, which had been one of the more successful gridiron football teams of that time. The contrasting colors were also chosen with consideration towards viewers of black and white television, which was still fairly common in the United States at this time (as one team director said, they were \"good colors for television\"). The team's name was chosen as a direct reference to their owner, RKO General. Freddie Goodwin was selected as head coach for the team and quickly assembled a team that included players such as Barrie Wright and César Luis Menotti. Pre-season training for the team was held at a high school soccer field in Florida. As part of an agreement with the New York Yankees, the Generals played their home games at Yankee Stadium. The team's held their first home game on April 22, 1967, a 2–1 victory against the Chicago Spurs. The Generals finished their sole season in the NPSL with a win–loss–tie record of 11–13–8.\n\nFollowing the 1967 season, the NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association (USA) to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). Following the merger, the New York Skyliners of the USA folded, making the New York Generals the sole major soccer team in New York City. While the two teams were initially planned to merge into one team, Peter Elser (who had become the Generals' sole owner following RKO General's withdrawal in January 1968) opted against this plan and continued to recruit partners and players for the Generals. Prior to the 1968 season, Gordon Bradley was hired as a player and assistant coach. Bradley had been brought to the attention of the Generals because of his experience as coach and player on the New York Ukrainians. Co Prins also joined the team following the folding of the Pittsburgh Phantoms, which he had been a member of the previous year. While the Generals improved to a 12–8–12 record, they again failed to qualify for postseason play. A highlight of the 1968 season occurred on July 12, when the Generals hosted Santos FC in an exhibition match at Yankee Stadium. The game, a 5–3 win for the Generals, is notable for featuring Pelé, who would later become a player in the NASL when he joined the New York Cosmos in 1975.\n\nFollowing the 1968 season, the NASL experienced severe hardships as their television contract with CBS expired and multiple teams folded. Famous tennis star Eugene Scott, who had been a director of the Generals, was appointed temporary chairman of the NASL. However, the following year, Phil Woosnam was appointed NASL commissioner and announced plans for a truncated 1969 season that would feature teams from the United Kingdom playing as stand-ins for their American counterparts. Following this, Scott left and the Generals soon after folded. The Generals became defunct in February 1969. New York City would remain without an NASL franchise until the 1971 season, when the New York Cosmos began play. The Cosmos would share a gold and green color scheme with the Generals and played their home games at the Generals' former home venue, Yankee Stadium. Furthermore, former Generals player Gordon Bradley served as the Cosmos' first head coach.\n\n\n"}

The show ran for five seasons on the USA Network, from March 2, 1996, to April 9, 2000, with a total of 101 episodes. Often described as \"\"Baywatch\" on bikes\", the series was run in many other markets, including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, South America, Sweden, and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe series underwent cast changes between the third and fourth seasons, one which dramatically altered its tone. The third-season finale brought the departure of actors Marcos Ferraez and Rick Rossovich. The fourth season premiere brought four major cast additions: Shanna Moakler as Monica Harper, Amy Hunter as Jamie Strickland, Jeff Stearns as Russ Granger, and Mario Lopez as Bobby Cruz. These new recruits to the Pacific Blue unit skewed the show's cast in a younger direction.\n\nJim Davidson and Paula Trickey, who had previously played the role of the show's young blood, evolved into the \"old guard\" as their characters took on leadership roles within the Pacific Blue unit. In addition, the characters of Jim Davidson and Darlene Vogel, who had become romantically linked in the third season, were married in the fourth season opener. Storylines for the fourth and fifth seasons emphasized undercover and vice work; while these areas would normally fall out of the purview of a police unit like Pacific Blue, the show always made an effort to explain away each incident as an exception, episode by episode. The changes can be credited with extending the life of the series for two additional seasons and made it the highest rated drama series on USA Network at the time. The series had well over 2 million regular viewers at a time when cable series were not permitted to advertise on other cable networks much less the Big Four broadcast networks.\n\nThe series featured numerous appearances by professional wrestling stars playing other characters, including Rena Mero (Sable), Chyna, Triple H and Shawn Michaels. (\"WWF Raw\" on the same network) Professional Intense Cycles Downhill Racer April Lawyer performed bike stunts in a number of episodes. trial rider Hans Rey performed tricks in each episode. Carmen Electra made a special guest appearance in her role from \"Baywatch\". Other notable guest stars included Micky Dolenz, Shannon Tweed, Shannon Elizabeth, Danny Bonaduce, Adam West, Erik Estrada, Holly Robinson Peete, Kent McCord and Stephen J. Cannell.\n\nThe series was created by Bill Nuss. It was executive produced by Gary Nardino, a producer and former president of Paramount Television and Bill Nuss. Their production company, North Hall Productions, took its name from their respective alma maters – Northwestern University and Seton Hall University. Nardino died on January 31, 1998, after which Nuss became the sole, chief show runner. Nuss continued to use the North Hall Productions name after Nardino's death.\n\nCo-executive producers included E! Entertainment Television founders, Alan Mruvka, Marilyn Vance, Rick Filon, Richard C. Okie and John B. Moranville.\n\n\"Pacific Blue\" was filmed in Santa Monica, Venice, Redondo Beach, Seal Beach and Huntington Beach, California, with the exception of two 1999 episodes that were filmed in Hawaii. Executive Producer Bill Nuss brought the show to Hawaii on the suggestion of April Masini, who also helped bring \"Baywatch\" to Hawaii in 1999. After the first 13 episodes, the series featured custom-painted state-of-the-art Trek Y bikes, outfitted with Spinergy wheels, NiteRider lights, and Janned police bags, making each bicycle worth over $5,000. The form-fitting uniforms are often credited with influencing the way bicycle cops dressed all over the world.\n\nOn January 10, 2012, Mill Creek Entertainment released \"Pacific Blue: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1. The 19-disc set features all 101 episodes of the series as well as 90 minutes of bonus features, including gag reels, production techniques and interviews. On the same day, Mill Creek also released the complete first season on DVD.\n\nThe series is also available for download on iTunes and other platforms.\n\nThe series still runs in many countries throughout the world. The show has gained a slight uptick in recognition with the MTV reality series \"Meet the Barkers\", which chronicles the married life of Blink 182 drummer Travis Barker and his wife (and \"Pacific Blue\" vet) Shanna Moakler. A clip of her from the series can be seen in the opening credits of \"Meet the Barkers\".\n\nIn the HBO series \"Entourage\", the backstory of Johnny 'Drama' Chase included fictional appearances on several episodes of \"Pacific Blue\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1955789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955789", "title": "Lipofuscin", "text": "Lipofuscin\n\nLipofuscin is the name given to fine yellow-brown pigment granules composed of lipid-containing residues of lysosomal digestion. It is considered to be one of the aging or \"wear-and-tear\" pigments, found in the liver, kidney, heart muscle, retina, adrenals, nerve cells, and ganglion cells. It is specifically arranged around the nucleus, and is a type of lipochrome.\n\nIt appears to be the product of the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and may be symptomatic of membrane damage, or damage to mitochondria and lysosomes. Aside from a large lipid content, lipofuscin is known to contain sugars and metals, including mercury, aluminium, iron, copper and zinc. Lipofuscin is also accepted as consisting of oxidized proteins (30–70%) as well as lipids (20–50%).\n\nThe accumulation of lipofuscin-like material may be the result of an imbalance between formation and disposal mechanisms: Such accumulation can be induced in rats by administering a protease inhibitor (leupeptin); after a period of three months, the levels of the lipofuscin-like material return to normal, indicating the action of a significant disposal mechanism. However, this result is controversial, as it is questionable if the leupeptin-induced material is true lipofuscin. There exists evidence that \"true lipofuscin\" is not degradable \"in vitro\"; whether this holds \"in vivo\" over longer time periods is not clear.\n\nThe \"ABCR -/-\" knockout mouse has delayed dark adaptation but normal final rod threshold relative to controls. Bleaching the retina with strong light leads to formation of toxic cationic \"bis\"-pyridinium salt, N\"-retinylidene-\"N\"-retinyl-ethanolamine (A2E\"), which causes dry and wet age-related macular degeneration. From this experiment, it was concluded that ABCR has a significant role in preventing formation of A2E in extracellular photoreceptor surfaces during bleach recovery.\n\nLipofuscin accumulation in the eye, is a major risk factor implicated in macular degeneration, a degenerative disease, and Stargardt disease, an inherited juvenile form of macular degeneration.\n\nIn the peripheral nervous system, abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin known as \"lipofuscinosis\" is associated with a family of neurodegenerative disorders – neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, the most common of these is Batten disease.\n\nAlso, pathological accumulation of lipofuscin is implicated in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, certain lysosomal diseases, acromegaly, denervation atrophy, lipid myopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and centronuclear myopathy. Accumulation of lipofuscin in the colon is the cause of the condition melanosis coli.\n\nOn the other hand, myocardial lipofuscin accumulation more directly reflects chronological ageing rather than human cardiac pathology.\n\nCalorie restriction, vitamin E, and increased glutathione appear to reduce or halt the production of lipofuscin.\n\nThe nootropic drug piracetam appears to significantly reduce accumulation of lipofuscin in the brain tissue of rats.\n\nOther possible treatments:\n\nWet macular degeneration can be treated using selective photothermolysis where a pulsed unfocused laser predominantly heats and kills lipofuscin-rich cells, leaving untouched healthy cells to multiply and fill in the gaps. The technique is also used as a skin treatment to remove tattoos, liverspots, and in general make skin appear younger. This ability to selectively target lipofuscin has opened up research opportunities in the field of anti-aging medicine.\n\nA tetrahydropyridoether can remove lipofuscin from retinal pigment epithelial cells. This opens up a new therapy option for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, for which there is currently no treatment. The drug has now been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of Stargardt disease by the European Medicines Agency.\n\nLipofuscin quantification is used for age determination in various crustaceans such as lobsters and spiny lobsters. Since these animals lack bony parts, they cannot be aged in the same way as bony fish, in which annual increments in the ear-bones or otoliths are commonly used. Age determination of fish and shellfish is a fundamental step in generating basic biological data such as growth curves, and is needed for many stock assessment methods. Several studies have indicated that quantifying the amount of lipofuscin present in the eye-stalks of various crustaceans can give an index of their age. This method has not yet been widely applied in fisheries management mainly due to problems in relating lipofuscin levels in wild-caught animals with accumulation curves derived from aquarium-reared animals.\n\n\n20.

The club was succeeded by the Philadelphia Fury in 1978.\n\nThe Atoms were founded by Philadelphia construction mogul Thomas McCloskey in 1973 at the urging of Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Tornado owner Lamar Hunt. Playing a largely American line-up, they won the NASL title in their first year of existence by defeating Hunt’s Dallas club 2–0. After this championship match, Philadelphia goalkeeper and Delaware Valley native Bob Rigby became the first soccer player to be featured on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nThe Atoms could not sustain the success of their first season as the club missed the playoffs in each of their remaining three NASL campaigns. Attendance began to flag and, after the 1975 season, the team was sold to a group of Mexican clubs, which included Club Deportivo Guadalajara. Fielding a primarily Mexican side (almost 30 years before Chivas USA would try a similar approach in Major League Soccer), attendance continued to wane and the club folded after the 1976 season.\n\nAlthough Clive Toye reports in his recent book that the franchise was sold to an ownership group from Montreal, he apparently confuses the fate of the next Philadelphia NASL team for that of the Atoms; the Atoms were, in fact, going to be relocated to San Antonio by their Mexican owners, who planned to replace the San Antonio Thunder franchise (which itself had just relocated to Honolulu to play as Team Hawaii). This plan never came to fruition, and the Philadelphia franchise was placed into receivership by the NASL.\n\nThe franchise was removed from receivership two years later when the Philadelphia Fury began their three-year run in Philadelphia in 1978.\n\nThe Atoms were also part of what is considered by soccer historians to be the birth of modern indoor soccer in the United States. On February 11, 1974 they hosted the Soviet Red Army team at the Spectrum in an exhibition match. That night, 11,790 roaring fans watched the reigning league champions hold their own into the final period before the Russians finally pulled away for a 6–3 victory. The following year the NASL staged its first league-wide indoor tournament, and within a few years both the NASL and the MISL were playing full indoor seasons.\n\nIn 2017 a new team began play in the American Soccer League called Philadelphia Atoms SC.

Among the club's investors were rock musicians Mick Jagger, Rick Wakeman, Peter Frampton and Paul Simon. They were the NASL's second attempt in Philadelphia, the first being the Philadelphia Atoms (1973–76). Although never posting a winning season, they did make the playoffs in two of their three seasons. Attendance declined with each season and in 1980, the club was sold and moved to Montreal, becoming the Montreal Manic.\n\nAfter the team ceased operations, the Fury name remained dormant until 2011 when the teams Intellectual property rights were purchased by Matt Driver, a former player and coach. The team began play in 2012 as an amateur team in the regional adult league the United States Club Soccer’s National Adult League. However, soon after the re-founding of the team it joined the American Soccer League, a league created and ran by Driver. The team played its games in Southern New Jersey.\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that the Fury were attempting to join the now defunct North American Soccer League (NASL) in a partnership with Driver, investors from the United Arab Emirates, and Spanish club SD Eibar. This deal would have also seen the ASL become a development league for the NASL. However, in 2018 the NASL went on hiatus after not receiving division II sanctioning and losing many of its teams to the USL Championship and the NPSL.\n\nIn 2019 it was reported that the Fury and Driver were again attempted to join a professional soccer league, this time it was the new National Independent Soccer Association.

Brooks\n\nWilliam L. \"Buffalo Bill\" Brooks (c. 1832 – July 29, 1874) was a western lawman and later outlaw.\n\nBrooks was born in Ohio around 1832 where he later became a buffalo hunter in the late-1840s or early-1850s whose success equaled fellow buffalo hunter William F. Cody earning the same nickname of \"Buffalo Bill\". During the late 1860s, Brooks had killed several men in various gunfights, and was briefly hired as a stage driver for the Southwestern Stage Co., before becoming the marshal of Newton, Kansas in 1872. Although he was reported to have been around 40 years old, several biographers have claimed Brooks was in his 20s.\n\nWith Brooks success in Newton he was soon offered a position in Dodge City as town marshal where he was later involved in 15 gunfights during his first month. In one case one of the men killed had four brothers who came after Brooks in revenge. As the brothers arrived in town Brooks was said to have killed all four men with four shots each. By the following year Brooks had cleared the city of most major criminals. Brooks however killed several men in questionable circumstances including one incident where he killed a man over an argument with a local dance hall girl. After backing down from gunfighter Kirk Jordan, Brooks left town shortly after.\n\nAccording to legend, Brooks went to Butte, Montana where he attempted to become the city marshal but, in part because of Brook's reputation, was instead passed over in favor of Morgan Earp. Confronting Earp over his defeat, Brooks was shot in the stomach and Morgan was shot in the shoulder.\n\nRecords show however that, shortly after leaving Dodge City, Brooks returned to his old position as a stage driver for the Southwestern Stage Co. in early 1874. Several months later however the company had lost a mail contract to a rival company and Brooks lost his job. In June several mules and horses owned by the rival company had been stolen and Brooks, with two other men, were arrested the next month. It was charged that Brooks had apparently attempted to weaken the rival company and win back the mail contract for the Southwestern Stage Company. Brooks was lynched while awaiting trial on July 29, 1874.\n\n"}
{"id": "1955806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955806", "title": "New Valley Project", "text": "New Valley Project\n\nThe New Valley Project or Toshka Project consists of building a system of canals to carry water from Lake Nasser to irrigate part of the sandy wastes of the Western Desert of Egypt, which is part of the Sahara Desert. In 1997 the Egyptian government decided to develop a new valley (as opposed to the existing Nile Valley) where agricultural and industrial communities would develop. It has been an ambitious project which was meant to help Egypt cope with its rapidly growing population.\n\nThe canal inlet starts from a site 8 km to the north of Toshka Bay (Khor) on Lake Nasser. The canal is meant to continue westwards until it reaches the Darb el-Arbe'ien route, then northwards along the Darb el- Arbe'ien to the Baris Oasis, covering a distance of 310 km. But as of April 2012 the canal is still 60 km short of the Baris Oasis. The Mubarak Pumping Station in Toshka is the centerpiece of the project and was inaugurated in March 2005. It pumps water from Lake Nasser to be transported by way of a canal through the valley, with the idea of transforming 2340 km² (588,000 acres) of desert into agricultural land. The Toshka Project has now been revived by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Half of the land will be given to college graduates, 1 acre each, funded by the Long Live Egypt Fund.\n\nThe essential problem is that the Western Desert's high saline levels and the presence of underground aquifers in the area act as a major obstacle to any irrigation project. As the land is irrigated, the salt would mix with the aquifers and would reduce access to potable water. There is also the difficulty that the clay minerals found in the soil are posing technical problems to the big wheeled structures moving around autonomously to irrigate the land. Often their wheels get stuck in a little bowl created by wet clay that dried, and the irrigation machines come to a standstill. The only objective met up to April 2012 is the diversion of water from Lake Nasser into what little of the Sheikh Zayed Canal has been built.\n\nThe Toshka Lakes are a by-product of the rising level of Lake Nasser and lie in the same general region as much of the New Valley Project.\n\n\n"}

The general administration divisions; Human Resources Division, the Financial Division, and External and Legislative Affairs, report directly to the Commissioner. It has two divisions \n\nand several bureaus, offices, and other work units, including (but not exclusively)\n\nThe Division of State Parks is responsible for the maintenance and management of over of state-owned forests and parks. These areas are designated as either Woodlands, Parklands, or Reserves, and are managed to maintain specific land-use characteristics.\n\nFrom the agency's beginning in 2003 until 2012, DCR land management was organized into three divisions: State Parks and Recreation, Urban Parks and Recreation, and Water Supply Protection. In 2012, State Parks and Urban Parks were unified into one division.\n\nWithin the greater Boston area there are urban wilds, historic sites, and other naturally aesthetic or significant environmental properties. The origins of the collective environments in this part of the division date back to the creation of the Metropolitan Park Commission in 1893, forming the first such regional system in the United States. (see Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston for history).\n\nLands outside of the greater Boston area includes some 29 campgrounds, over of trails, 87 beaches, 37 swimming, wading, and spray pools, 62 playgrounds, 55 ballfields, of paved bike and rail trails and once private homes and estates that are now a part of the DCR's Historic Curatorship Program.\n\n\nThe Division of Water Supply Protection manages of watershed lands and is responsible for the protection of the drinking water supply for approximately 2.5 million residents of Massachusetts, primarily in Greater Boston. This division monitors lakes and ponds, well drillers, and rainfall throughout the Commonwealth.\n\n\nThe Bureau of Engineering provides professional engineering, design, and construction management services in support of DCR properties. In addition to providing engineering services for over of parks, forests, watersheds, beaches, 340 dams, and numerous recreational facilities, the Bureau of Engineering also manages over 525 lane miles of parkways and nearly 300 bridges and tunnels notable for their landmark stature and importance in the Commonwealth’s transportation system.\n\nThe Bureau operates under the direction of a Chief Engineer and is sub-divided into six operating units:\n\nThe Bureau is responsible for the management of the majority of the DCR's annual capital budget which has declined in recent years from a $150–200 million high to a current $70–80 million.\n\nThe Bureau of Engineering manages and/or operates a number of parkways across the Commonwealth, including:\n\n\nThe Bureau of Engineering managed and/or operated a number of bridges across the Commonwealth prior to November 2009. All non-pedestrian bridges were transferred to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation on November 1, 2009 as part of a transportation reform law. Originally, a certain number of bridges listed in the act creating MassDOT were to be transferred after December 31, 2014 when ongoing construction was completed. However, a Memorandum of Agreement between DCR and MassDOT instead transferred these bridges in 2009 along with all other DCR vehicular bridges.\n\nA partial listing of notable bridges formerly under the DCR, with the exception of pedestrian bridges still managed by the department and listed here, include:\n\nThe Bureau of Engineering owns and manages and/or operates a number of dams and flood control facilities across the Commonwealth, including:\n\nDCR is responsible for the stewardship of its lands, from general maintenance—such as emptying trash barrels, cutting grass, and making building improvements—to landscape-level management.\n\nDCR also provides services beyond its boundaries, For example, Bureau of Forest Fire Control is available to aid and assist local cities and towns during natural disasters as well as periods of high fire danger, while its Bureau of Forestry administers forest management on both state and private lands.\n\nDCR also manages its land through the help of partners. Road repairs are sometimes implemented by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation at the request of DCR. Police protection has been provided by the Massachusetts State Police after the MDC's police department was merged into the State Police in 1992.\n\nIn addition to partnering with state agencies, DCR coordinates with local and national volunteer organizations, such as the Mystic River Watershed Association, Friends of the Middlesex Fells, Appalachian Mountain Club, and local student organizations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1955818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955818", "title": "Season (society)", "text": "Season (society)\n\nThe social season, or season, refers to the traditional annual period when it is customary for members of a social elite of society to hold balls, dinner parties and charity events. Until World War I, it was also the appropriate time to be resident in the city rather than in the country in order to attend such events.\n\nIn modern times in the United Kingdom, \"the Season\" is known to encompass various prestigious events that take place during the spring and summer. According to Sloaney Season, it starts with Cheltenham Festival (March), and includes the Grand National (April), The Boat Race (April), Badminton Horse Trials (May), Chelsea Flower Show (May), Epsom Derby (June), Royal Ascot (June), Test matches at Lord's (July), Wimbledon (July), Henley Royal Regatta (July), Edinburgh Festival Fringe (August) and others, ending with Goodwood Revival (September).\n\nThe London social season evolved in the 17th and 18th centuries, and in its traditional form it peaked in the 19th century. In this era the British elite was dominated by landowning aristocratic and gentry families who generally regarded their country house as their main home, but spent several months of the year in the capital to socialise and to engage in politics. The most exclusive events were held at the town mansions of leading members of the aristocracy. Exclusive public venues such as Almack's played a secondary role. The Season coincided with the sitting of parliament; it began some time after Christmas and ran until midsummer, roughly late June.\n\nThe social season played a role in the political life of the country: the members of the two Houses of Parliament were almost all participants in the season. But the Season also provided an opportunity for the children of marriageable age of the nobility and gentry to be launched into society. Debutantes were formally introduced into society by presentation to the monarch at royal court during Queen Charlotte's Ball until the practice was abolished by Queen Elizabeth II in 1958. Queen Charlotte's Ball ceased to function in 1976, but has been relaunched since without the monarch's involvement, and with more limited uptake; debutantes instead curtsy to \"Queen Charlotte's Birthday Cake\".\n\nThe traditional Season went into decline after the First World War, when many aristocratic families gave up their London mansions. From then on, more society events took place at public venues, making it harder to maintain social exclusivity.\n\nMany events that take place far from central London came to be regarded as part of the social season, including Royal Ascot and the Henley Royal Regatta. The events that now constitute the London social season are increasingly hosted or sponsored by large companies (i.e. \"corporate hospitality\"). Western dress codes still apply to certain events in the season, especially where the Queen maintains an official role.\n\nAccording to the peerage guide Debrett's, the traditional social season runs from April to August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough several of these events are not actually held in London, such as the Hurlingham Polo Association at Guards Polo Club, the organisers of most events attempt to avoid date clashes, so it is generally possible to visit all of them in the same year.\n\nThe traditional end of the London Season is the Glorious Twelfth of August, which marks the beginning of the shooting season. Society would retire to the country to shoot birds during the autumn and hunt foxes during the winter before coming back to London again with the spring.\n\nMany events of the season have traditional expectations with regard to Western dress codes.\n\nLondon is the capital of shops and of speculation, the government is made there. The aristocracy inscribes itself there only during sixty days, it there takes its orders, it inspects the government kitchen, it passes in review its daughters to marry, and equipages to sell, it says good-day and goes away promptly ; - it is so little amusing that it supports itself only for the few days called the season.\n\n"}
{"id": "1955819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955819", "title": "Birmingham High School", "text": "Birmingham High School\n\nBirmingham Community Charter High School (formerly Birmingham High School) is an independent charter coeducational high school in the neighborhood/district of Lake Balboa in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles, California, United States. It was founded in 1953 as a 7-12 grade combined high school, and became solely a senior high school in 1963. The school has a Van Nuys address and serves Lake Balboa, parts of Encino, and Amestoy Estates. It is within the Los Angeles Unified School District but it is operated as an internal charter school.\n\nThe land of Birmingham High School was an US Army Hospital called Birmingham General Hospital from August 24, 1943 till March 31, 1946. From 1946 to 1950 the Hospital was the Birmingham Veterans Administration Hospital. In 1952 the Hospital was sold to the Los Angeles City Schools for $1.00. The Hospital was named after Brigadier General Henry Patrick Birmingham (1854-1932), with the World War 1 US Army Medical Corps. \nThe school opened in 1953, during the immediate post-World War II era. Originally it served children grades seven to 12 from families newly settled in the San Fernando Valley. As of the 1960s the families were middle-class, and many of them had settled in the San Fernando Valley from the East Coast and the Midwest.\n\nIn 1994 Northrop Corp. gave the school a $1,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) grant for mathematics and/or science curriculum and instruction, and the mathematics department used it to procure calculators and computer software.\n\nBy 2006 the student demographics became majority Latino and Hispanic.\n\nBy 2006 Marsha Coates, the principal, established \"small learning communities\" and a ninth grade academy to cater to incoming students.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) voted to allow the high school to become a charter school under the name Birmingham Community Charter High School. Prior to the approval, the school officials had fought over whether the school should become a charter for months. Some school officials had advocated creating an alternate school sponsored by the teacher's union on the same campus. About 66% of the faculty members of the school supported the charter change. After the charter was approved, 91 teachers continued to teach at Birmingham while 34 decided to leave to work at other LAUSD schools. This meant the Spanish, science, and history departments had a high level of turnover.\n\nBecause of the divisions within teachers and other staff members, the faculty and staff of the magnet program received permission from LAUSD to split from Birmingham. In 2009, Daniel Pearl Magnet High School was formed as an independent high school within the Birmingham campus. Connie Llanos of the \"Los Angeles Daily News\" said that Pearl \"got off to a rocky start.\" During the first year as a standalone school, one third of the students left. Some left due to conflicts with Birmingham staff and students; some Birmingham students and staff members tormented Pearl students. Some left because Pearl was so small; they wanted a more comprehensive high school experience. Pearl moved into its own facility next to Birmingham in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 LAUSD officials accused the school of failing to adequately respond to allegations of racial discrimination and mishandling disabled student services and expulsion, and the LAUSD officials attempted to return Birmingham to direct district control. Birmingham officials stated that they were unaware of serious problems at their school.\n\nThe school is located in the Lake Balboa area, which was previously a part of Van Nuys. The site was previously a military hospital.\n\nAs of 2009, Birmingham has the largest high school campus in the LAUSD, at 53 acres. The campus is in proximity to Reseda.\n\nIts attendance boundary includes Lake Balboa, and portions of Van Nuys, Encino, Tarzana, and Reseda.\n\nIn 2006 Mitchell Landsberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"It would be easy to see Birmingham as just another bad public school. But for many students, it's not.\" He cited the Daniel Pearl Journalism Magnet, the \"dedicated core of teachers\" and the \"variety of honors and Advanced Placement classes.\" Landsberg stated that despite the demographic changes that came before 2006, \"academic standards have not suffered; if anything, a Birmingham diploma today is more difficult to obtain than it was a generation ago.\"\n\nIn 2009 the school had 2,700 students. That year, Mitchell Landsberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Birmingham is in some ways the quintessential Los Angeles school, with demographics and student performance that come close to mirroring the city as a whole.\"\n\nIn September 2001 there were 1,100 9th graders entering Birmingham High School; this class would become the Class of 2005. Over 350 of the students in this class, over the course of the years, switched to other schools to study. About half of the switching students remained at traditional high schools and the other half went to independent study, vocational school, or other alternative educational settings. In June 2005 there were 521 graduating students of the Class of 2005, fewer than half of the starting number. Media attention to this rate of graduation resulted in a nighttime meeting with parents.\n\nIn a period prior to 2006 students zoned to overcrowded high schools were bused to Birmingham. 102 students who were zoned to Belmont High School were instead a part of the Birmingham Class of 2005.\n\nAs of 2006 there were almost 4,000 students attending the school.\n\nLandsberg wrote in 2006 that there had been ethnic conflicts between Latino and African-American students and between Latino and Armenian students.\n\nIn 2006 Mitchell Landsberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Many students thrived at Birmingham\", but \"many others struggled, or gave up and quit.\" As of that year, he stated that the school \"sent its share of students to good colleges -- Cal State and UC campuses, even the Ivy League.\" In the Class of 2005, about 75% had intentions to partake in higher education. Over 60 students from that class went to the University of California campuses.\n\nIn 2006 the LAUSD gave the official four-year graduation rate of Birmingham High as being almost 80%, with an official dropout rate of 3.5%. A Civil Rights Project at Harvard University/University of California Los Angeles published a report in the northern hemisphere Spring of 2005 that stated that the four year graduation rate at Birmingham was 50%.\n\nIn 2009, 9% of students were rated as proficient or higher in mathematics and 34% were rated as proficient or higher in English. In 2008 9% received this rating in mathematics and 36% received this rating in English.\n\nIn 2006, principal Marsha Coates stated, \"We have 20, 30 kids or so who are constantly out of class. They're on campus, they're not dropouts and they haven't disappeared. They just roam.\" Despite the school giving out tickets to truants and a new attendance system implemented on November 6, 2005, as of 2006 there were still truant students walking in the halls of the school.\n\nBirmingham High School has been used as the backdrop for numerous music videos, commercials, and television shows, such as the music video for Simple Plan's song \"Can't Keep My Hands Off You\", Missy Elliott's song \"Gossip Folks\", Gwen Stefani's song \"Hollaback Girl\", Corbin Bleu's song \"Push It to the Limit,\" Eminem's \"No Love\", and Lil Wayne's \"Prom Queen\". In 2007 an episode of \"America's Next Top Model\" was filmed there. Other shows filmed at Birmingham High School include \"Nip/Tuck\", \"NCIS\", \"Cold Case\", \"Scrubs\", \"The Office\", \"Ghost Whisperer\" and \"Monk\".\n\nThe school's football field was used as a set for the shoot of the music video for Angels & Airwaves' song \"Everything's Magic\". The track surrounding the football field served as the location for the relay race scene starring Kirk Cameron in \"Like Father Like Son\". An episode of \"Full House\" was filmed there, with Danny, Jessy, and Joey running a race around the track. In addition, Fanny Pak of \"America's Best Dance Crew\" comes to the dance studio to practice before they go on tour.\n\nIn June 2009 Los Angeles Schools superintendent Ramon C. Cortines objected to photographs of the school's football team posing with comedian Sacha Baron Cohen in his guise as Brüno that appeared in \"GQ\" magazine. Although Cortines gave discipline against principal Marcia Coates and athletic director Rick Prizant, Cortines stated that the discipline could not be enforced, because, since Birmingham was becoming a charter school, Coates and Prizant would no longer be LAUSD employees.\n\nMiranda Cosgrove's music video for \"Dancing Crazy\" was filmed on the football field. The hit show on MTV, \"Awkward\", has also been filmed at Birmingham.\n\nThe school's athletic nickname is the Patriot. Originally the nickname was the Braves. Native Americans in the San Fernando Valley had campaigned against the use of the \"Braves\" mascot at Birmingham High, as part of a national movement to remove Native American mascots. They met the Los Angeles School Board because, according to Paul Kivel, author of \"Uprooting Racism: How White People Can Work for Racial Justice Ð 3rd Edition\", they \"met with so much intransigence at the high school\". The LAUSD school board voted to remove Native American mascots and logos from all schools.\n\nThe school was told that it needed to change its mascot by June 28, 1998. The students voted for the new mascot to be the \"Blue Devil\". Gerald Kleinman, the principal at the time, stated that the school's mascot committee believed the \"Blue Devil\" was an inappropriate choice and overruled the students, instead choosing the \"Patriot\".\n\nUnder coach Ed Croson, the football team won CIF Southern Section championships in 2005, 2007 and 2008, with contributions from future NFL players Malik Jackson, Mychal Rivera and Donovan Carter, as well as standouts such as Milton Knox, Marquis Jackson (Malik's twin brother), and TJ Rosas.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2007, the basketball coach was Andre McCarter, MVP for the Rochester, New York Zeniths of the Continental Basketball Association in the 1978–79 season. McCarter played on UCLA's national championship teams in the early 1970s under John Wooden.\n\nIn 2006 the Birmingham boys' soccer team achieved to win the first ever L.A city section championship in school history, coached by E.B Madha, upsetting the Canoga Park Hunters. Robert Villa made school history by becoming the first goalkeeper to start every match including the city section finals as a freshman.\n\nIn the 2008–09 school year, Birmingham introduced a lacrosse team.\n\nIn 2013 the Birmingham wrestling team achieved to win the first ever L.A. City Section Championship in school history.\n\nIn 2010 the Birmingham cross country team went on to win both the boys' and girls' L.A. City Section Championship, adding to head coach Scott King's 16 city championships in his time at Birmingham.\n\nThe track surrounding the football field, was home to the CIF Los Angeles City Section Championships until 2014.\n\n\n"}

At age thirteen, he played clarinet in a military band and later learned the alto saxophone, but after moving to Stockholm in 1947 became a professional musician as a pianist. He planned on a classical career, studying privately with classical pianist Sven Brandel. Although he actually filled the baritone chair in Seymour Österwall’s band in 1949 by chance, it was enough for him to decide that it was an instrument with possibilities, influenced too by hearing the United States baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan for the first time on the \"Birth of the Cool\" recordings. He worked as a member of Arne Domnérus’s septet (initially co-led by the trumpeter Rolf Ericson) for two years from 1951; the group mainly performed at Nalen, a leading dance spot in Stockholm.\n\nAt the same time he began to work with visiting American musicians, recording with James Moody, Zoot Sims and Clifford Brown. Most importantly, he first performed with Lee Konitz in 1951, an association which was to be repeated several times in future years.\n\nHe formed his own group in 1953, probably the only regular group he was to lead. It was short-lived, breaking up that November, after Gullin was responsible for causing the group to be involved in an automobile accident, although no one was seriously hurt. The next year, 1954, he won the best newcomer award in the United States \"Down Beat\" magazine, after two March 1953 Swedish sessions were leased and issued by Contemporary Records as a 10” LP. Later Gullin albums were leased to Atlantic Records in the United States. Gullin toured several European countries with Chet Baker in October 1955, in a group which was marred by tragedy; it was Gullin who found the body of the group's pianist Dick Twardzik, victim of a heroin overdose, on 21 October, in a Paris hotel room.\n\nThe remainder of Gullin’s career was blighted by his own narcotics problems, and sometimes he survived on artists’ grants from the Swedish government. He was restricted by illness for much of the later part of 1958. During most of 1959 Gullin was active in Italy, he played with Chet Baker again and with the jazz alto saxophonist (and businessman) Flavio Ambrosetti, making radio broadcasts with him in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nIn the 1960s he continued to work occasionally with leading American players, including Archie Shepp, with whom he recorded in 1963. One of his last major statements was his \"Aeros aromatic atomica suite\" recorded in 1973.\n\nHe died of a heart attack, brought on by his long-term addiction to methadone. A recording jointly led by Lee Konitz and pianist Lars Sjösten, \"Dedicated to Lee … Play the Music of Lars Gullin\" was recorded in 1983, and issued by Dragon Records, who have also issued 11 CDs of Gullin’s recordings. The film \"Sven Klang's Combo\" (\"Sven Klangs kvintett\", 1976) is a fictionalised version of the Swedish jazz scene of the 1950s, and the saxophonist Lars is indeed based on Gullin.\n\nHis son, Peter Gullin, (12 April 1959, Milan, Italy – 7 October 2003, Uppsala, Sweden) was also a baritone saxophonist and composer. The elder Gullin’s composition \"Peter of April\" was dedicated to him. The classic tune \"Danny's Dream\" was dedicated to his first son Danny Gullin and \"Gabriella\" to his daughter, Gabriella Gullin (born 1961), a composer and conductor.\n\nAs leader\n\nWith Stan Getz\n\nWith Quincy Jones\n\n"}

{"id": "1955844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955844", "title": "St. Louis Stars (soccer)", "text": "St. Louis Stars (soccer)\n\nThe St. Louis Stars were a soccer team based in St. Louis, Missouri that played in the original North American Soccer League from 1968 to 1977. The Stars were known for playing mostly American players, many from the St. Louis area, in contrast to other NASL teams' reliance on foreign players. The team moved to Anaheim in 1978 and became the California Surf.\n\nThe St. Louis Stars, founded in 1967 as a team in the National Professional Soccer League, were the first ever professional soccer team in St. Louis, although St. Louis had a long history of strong play in amateur leagues and college soccer. The Stars were headed by St. Louis businessman Bob Hermann. Hermann later went on to become president of the NPSL, and to create the Hermann Trophy, college soccer's version of the Heisman Trophy.\nThe Stars immediately stole the spotlight from the local amateur clubs and attracted many mainstream sports fans. The first Stars team included players from nine different countries, with nine players from Yugoslavia, and the majority of the team did not speak English. The Stars' average attendance 7,613 was the highest in the league. After the season, the NPSL merged with the rival United Soccer Association to form the North American Soccer League. The Stars became a member of the newly merged league.\n\nFollowing the 1968 NASL season, the league was in trouble with ten franchises having folded. The team's owners cut back on players' salaries, and the team became semi-pro.\nThe 1969 season was split into two halves. The first half was called the International Cup, a double round robin tournament in which the remaining NASL clubs were represented by teams imported from the United Kingdom. The Stars were represented by Kilmarnock F.C. of Scotland. The Stars came in last for the Cup with a 2–5–1 record. For the second half of the 1969 season, the teams returned to their normal rosters, and played a 16-game schedule with no playoffs.\n\nAfter the first two money-losing seasons, the team's owners cut back. The Stars became a semi-pro team, with players paid by the game and holding other jobs. Consequently, the team began to draw poor crowds, averaging fewer than 4,000 fans per game for the three seasons from 1969–71.\n\nOn March 19, 1971 the Stars hosted the 1971 NASL Professional Hoc-Soc Tournament, which was the first indoor soccer tournament sanctioned by a Division One professional league in U.S. history. The Stars lost there opening match, 2–1, but rebounded, 2–0, to win the third place match up.\n\nThe Stars best season was 1972. The Stars won the Southern Division that year, defeated the Rochester Lancers 2–1 in a semifinal match held at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, and in Final they lost 2–1 to the Cosmos in a match played at Hofstra Stadium in New York. Pat McBride (MF) and John Sewell (DF) were named first team all-stars for the 1972 season. The team's success reinvigorated fan appeal, leading the league in attendance in 1972 with close to 8,000 fans per match, and continuing to draw over 6,000 fans each season from 1972 to 1977.\n\nThe Stars' legacy is one of developing American players, in particular drawing players from the local St. Louis area talent pool, instead of recruiting aging foreign players with high contracts. From 1969 to 1976, the Stars' squads were mostly American players. The Stars could afford to rely on local talent because at the time St. Louis had strong college teams and amateur competitions, with St. Louis University winning 10 NCAA national championships from 1959 to 1973. This strategy is one of the reasons for the Stars' longevity (lasting ten seasons during some the NASL's most turbulent times), but often the team was mediocre. On February 13, 1974 the Stars played host (and lost, 11–4) to the Red Army team at the St. Louis Arena in the final match of Russian squad's three city, North American indoor soccer tour. St. Louis went on to participate in both the 1975 and 1976 NASL indoor tournaments with little success.\n\nIn 1975 the Stars signed a foreign star in Peter Bonetti. Bonetti had played for England from 1966–1970, was the backup goalkeeper to Gordon Banks on England's winning team in the 1966 World Cup, and had started one match at the 1970 World Cup. Bonetti had a solid season with the Stars, and was named a NASL first-team all-star for the 1975 season. The Stars won the Central Division in 1975, defeated the L.A. Aztecs in the quarterfinals at Busch Memorial Stadium, and lost to the Portland Timbers in the semifinals. John Sewell was named NASL Coach of the Year.\n\nIn 1977, the Stars once again recruited an English goalkeeper, Bill Glazier, who was supposed to be England's backup goalkeeper at the 1966 World Cup, but had suffered a broken leg. Glazier was not successful, however, as John Jackson won the starting goalkeeper role for the 1977 season. In 1977 the Stars finished second in the Northern Division, qualifying for the playoffs, where they lost in the first round to Rochester at Busch Memorial Stadium. Key players for the 1977 Stars team were DF Ray Evans (NASL second-team all-star) and MF Al Trost (NASL honorable mention).\n\nFrom 1967–68 and 1971–74 the Stars played at Busch Memorial Stadium and from 1969–70 and 1975–77 the home games were held at Francis Field.\n\nBy 1977, the Stars emphasis on American players had begun to erode slightly. Although the 1977 squad was still mostly American, the squad did include eight Englishmen. There was an attempt to return to Busch for 1978, but the Stars were not able to secure a lease to their liking. With only small Francis Field available as an option and player salaries rising sharply, there seemed little alternative but to move. So after the 1977 season, the Stars moved to Anaheim and became the California Surf. Although the California Surf retained their core group of American (mostly St. Louis) players, under English coach John Sewell the California Surf imported more English players.\n\nNPSL Commissioner's Cup\n\nNASL Championships\n\nDivision titles\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nU.S. Soccer Hall of Fame\n\nIndoor Soccer Hall of Fame\n\nAll-Star First Team Selections\n\nAll-Star Second Team Selections\n\nAll-Star Honorable Mentions\n\nIndoor All-Stars\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1955845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955845", "title": "Team America (NASL)", "text": "Team America (NASL)\n\nTeam America was a professional version of the United States men's national soccer team which played as a franchise in the North American Soccer League (NASL) during the 1983 season. The team was based in Washington, D.C., played its home games at RFK Stadium, and was intended by the NASL and the United States Soccer Federation to build fan support for the league and create a cohesive and internationally competitive national team. However, the team finished in last place and drew only 13,000 fans per game.\n\nA \"Team America\" also played an unofficial exhibition match against England in 1976, to commemorate the bicentennial of American Independence. The players were drawn from North American Soccer League clubs and included Pele and Bobby Moore. The match was played in Philadelphia and England won, 3–1.\n\nThe origins of Team America came with the ascension of Howard J. Samuels to the positions of president and CEO of NASL on June 25, 1982. At the time, the league was on the verge of collapsing. The league had 21 teams at the end of the 1981 season, but began the 1982 season with only 14. Attendance was dropping and the league had lost its television contract. To reverse these trends, Samuels proposed turning the league’s focus away from international stars to domestic players in order to create a larger fan base. Samuels’ concept dovetailed with a desire on the part of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) to build a more successful national team program. In order to fulfill the twin objectives of nurturing new U.S. talent to reach a greater fan base while feeding that talent into the national team, Samuels and the USSF decided to enter the national team into NASL as a franchise. At the time, U.S. players found it difficult to compete for roster spots against the foreigners who stocked most of the league’s teams. In theory, Team America would only feature U.S. players who would train with each other, fostering a sense of team cohesion which would pay dividends when the U.S. played international games. The name Team America was a reference to both the U.S. national team as well as the 1976 Team America, a team which combined U.S. national team players with the addition of several NASL international stars, which played in the 1976 U.S.A. Bicentennial Cup Tournament.\n\nSamuels brought in Robert Lifton as the team owner, and in coordination with Lifton and USSF secured RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. as the team’s home field. In January 1983, the NASL and USSF invited 39 players from the NASL, American Soccer League (ASL) and Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) to tryouts for the 20 available roster spots. However, several top U.S. players, including Rick Davis, Jimmy McAllister, Winston DuBose, David Brcic, and Juli Veee, refused to leave their teams to play for Team America. This forced the NASL and USSF to turn to recently naturalized players -- ten of the 21 on the roster (see below) had been born outside the US, including Alan Green, who was still a British subject in 1983 (he finally gained American citizenship the following year). Several top U.S. players did join the club, including Chico Borja, Jeff Durgan, Arnie Mausser and Perry Van der Beck. Even Alketas Panagoulias, USA team manager (and thus Team America manager by default) was himself a naturalized citizen. (Panagoulis had led the New York Greek-Americans to three US Open Cup triumphs in the early 1960s and was later manager of the Greek national team at the 1994 World Cup, but earned his living selling real estate.)\n\nWearing a red, white and blue uniform with a horizontally striped jersey, the team began well, going 8–5 (including a shootout win over the Cosmos in front of 31,112 at RFK on June 17) but lost 15 of its last 17 games, finishing at the bottom of the standings with a 10–20 record. (Lack of scoring punch was the biggest problem: the club scored just five goals in the entire month of July, losing all eight matches. Team America's 33 goals on the season was barely one per game and easily the worst in the league.) None of the players were named to the league's All Star team. As the team stumbled through the regular season, Samuels and Lifton became desperate. On July 27, 1983, they announced that they had approached the owners of the other NASL, as well as MISL, teams about loaning U.S. players to Team America on a game by game basis when the players' regular teams had an idle game day. However, MISL refused the NASL/USSF request for player loans, citing the NASL policy forbidding teams in that league from loaning its players to MISL. Lack of success on the field led to tensions among U.S. national team players. Some, such as Jeff Durgan, publicly criticized Rick Davis and Steve Moyers for choosing to remain with the Cosmos rather than signing with Team America. Mark Peterson, the North American Soccer League's player of the year in 1982, began the season with the Seattle Sounders, but joined Team America during the 1983 season after receiving severe criticism from other U.S. players.\n\nThe team's initial attendance figures were decent enough: an average of 19,952 through the first seven home matches. (This was a little misleading, however: the figure includes the 50,108 who attended a match vs. Fort Lauderdale that featured a free Beach Boys concert; the other six matches averaged just 14,926.) As the losses piled up, though, the fans stopped coming to RFK: barely 55,000 showed up for the last eight home games combined, lowering Team America's average to just 13,002 for the entire 1983 season. This was actually third-best in the rapidly-fading 12-team NASL, but it wasn't enough to avoid severe financial losses, especially when coupled with the USSF's inability to finalize several potential marketing deals. Panagoulis wondered aloud, \"Where are we going? What the hell are we\ndoing? Why do these people keep paying me?\" At the end of the season, Robert Lifton pulled the plug on the franchise; afterwards, he, Commissioner Samuels and the USSF engaged in much public rancour and wrangling over who was most responsible for the club's failure.\n\nThe Team America fiasco may also have had a hand in the destruction of another NASL franchise, the Montreal Manic. In his book, \"Soccer in a Football World\", North American soccer historian Dave Wangerin partially attributes the downfall of the Manic organization to the Molson ownership's declaration to attempt to build a Team Canada roster for the 1984 season. The new direction of the club meant many of the Manic's non-Canadian players would be let go; given Canada's poor track record at producing world class soccer talent, fans were put off by the prospect that the team's play would diminish. (The fact the franchise played in francophone Montreal, rife with separatist sentiment, didn't help.) Sure enough, the Manic managed only a 12-18 mark in 1983 and saw their attendance drop by more than half, attracting only 9,910 fans per contest. Team Canada in the NASL never became a reality, as the Manic (who had already lost a reported $7 million in its first two seasons) folded after the 1983 season.\n\n\n"}

The neighbourhood contains many Asian restaurants, food markets, and convenience stores as well being home to many of Montreal's East Asian community centres, such as the Montreal Chinese Hospital and the Montreal Chinese Community and Cultural Center. CHUM Hospital is located in Chinatown.\n\nThe area was once home to Montreal's Jewish community, with thousands of Yiddish speaking immigrants settling in the area from 1890 to 1920, as part of a Jewish quarter centred on Saint Laurent Boulevard.\n\nThe first Chinese immigrants to Montreal arrived in March 1877. The first Chinese that created Montreal's Chinatown belonged to the Chan, Hom (Tam), Lee, and Wong clan groups. Many Taishan Chinese settled (all following the Leung Family) in the area because they worked for the railways and it was convenient for these occupations. \n\nAmong the first Chinese residents was Jos Song Long who opened a laundromat on Craig Street (today Saint Antoine Street). Most Chinese residents were primarily Cantonese-speaking and had moved from British Columbia and southern China to what had been a primarily residential area. Initially, many Chinese Montrealers ran laundromats, as owning their own businesses allowed them to avoid the pay discrimination that they had faced in British Columbia. Businesses such as laundromats required geographic proximity to its customers, and as a result, this type of business became quite common in Montreal, with Chinatown being largely commercially oriented.\n\nIn 1902, the area officially became known as \"Chinatown\", and specifically referred to several blocks centered on De La Gauchetière Street between Chenneville and Clark Streets. On these streets, many Chinese-owned businesses opened, notably restaurants and specialty grocers. The neighbourhood was strategically located with modest-sized lots, affordable rents and close proximity to Saint-Laurent Boulevard, which attracted non-Chinese clients.\n\nOver the years, Hong Kong Chinese and ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam also set up shops and restaurants in the area.\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards Montreal's Chinatown was subject to many of the cities' redevelopment plans, reducing the size of Chinatown and its expansion. This saw to the expropriation and demolition of over 6 acres of private properties in the construction of the Complexe Guy-Favreau and a city block of Chinatown for the construction of Palais des congrès de Montréal, even as community consultation and negotiations were still on-going. Rezoning of areas east of Saint Laurent from Chinatown in the 1980s has further prevented the growth expansion of Chinatown businesses.\n\nMuch of Montreal Chinatown is located on La Gauchetière Street and around Saint Urbain Street and Saint Lawrence Boulevard (\"boul. Saint-Laurent\"), between René Lévesque Boulevard and Viger Avenue (Place-d'Armes Montreal metro station), occupying roughly the area of a city block. The part of La Gauchetière that crosses through Chinatown is a pedestrian walkway, making it more inviting for a stroll. On several weekends during the summer, the street becomes a lively outdoor fair. Prior to 1970, a significant part of Chinatown extended west to Jeannes-Mance Street.\n\nMontreal has the most paifang of any Chinatown in Canada, with 4 gates in the:\n\nMontreal's Chinatown is a vibrant nightspot for locals and tourists alike thanks to a special regulation by Montreal's city officials which slates the sector as a tourist area, thus allowing it to continue operations well into the evening. Cantonese seafood, barbecue and dim sum restaurants and Vietnamese Phở eateries are featured in Chinatown. Many local Asian-Canadians frequent the area since the shops offer products directly imported from Mainland China or Vietnam that are difficult to find elsewhere in town.\n\nAside from its economic importance in the sector, Montreal's Chinatown actively participate in numerous community activities. The offices of many Chinese newspapers, organizations and associations are located in the surrounding buildings. Moreover, the Chinatown houses the biggest Chinese school of Montreal (over 1500 students) as well as the Montreal Chinese Catholic Mission. Over the years, the Canadian government has continually sought to invest in the area by funding the construction of the Montreal Chinese Hospital and the Montreal Chinese Cultural and Community Center.\n\nLike many other Chinatowns, Montreal also has the annual Miss Chinese Montreal Pageant, where the winner goes on to compete at the Miss Chinese International Pageant, which is usually held in Hong Kong or in mainland China. \n\nChinatown was the filming location of the 2008 film release \"\". Some parts of Chinatown were redressed with English-language signage to recreate the atmosphere of Chinatown, Manhattan.\n\nThere are Four Chinese language weekly newspapers operating in Montreal: \"La Grande Époque Montréal, Les Presses Chinoises, Sept Days\", and the \"Luby\".\n\nA new Chinatown has begun to develop in the area west of Concordia University in the last fifteen years, particularly along Sainte Catherine Street between Guy Street and Atwater Avenue. It caters primarily to the growing mainland Chinese and East Asian student and immigrant population in the area. As of 2006, 22.9% of the area's population were of Chinese origin. The area is commonly known as the \"Concordia Ghetto\", similar to the \"McGill Ghetto\" found in Milton Parc, a student neighborhood located directly east of McGill.\n\nVarious Asian-themed malls have arisen along Taschereau Boulevard in the south shore suburb of Brossard, where a significant portion of the population is of Chinese origin. The provincial government of Quebec enticed Hong Kong millionaires to settle and invest in the province, particularly in Brossard. The shopping centres were largely funded by Hong Kong Chinese immigrant investors, some of whom have since returned to Hong Kong or have relocated to larger Chinese immigrant centres such as Toronto and Vancouver. A wide range of Chinese restaurants, grocers, and services can still be found in Brossard.\n\n\n\n"}

Weekend services for adults, students and children are considered the main venues where the Love God purpose is fulfilled. Life Groups (small community groups and support groups) are viewed as the fundamental way the church shows its love and concern for people. The church's Serve the World purpose is accomplished through various initiatives (throughout the Pacific Northwest and the world); the primary of which are centered on HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and orphan care through fostering and adoption. The church also has a major focus on assisting unhoused people and single mothers in the Puget Sound region.\n\nThe Lead Pastor is Mike Howerton, who was the \"Next Generation\" pastor at Saddleback Church (pastored by Rick Warren) in Orange County, California until 2004. Howerton has authored three books, \"Ride of Your Life\", \"Glorious Mess\" and \"Miles to Cross\", and was a contributing author to another entitled, \"The Relevant Church\". The church is governed by a volunteer board of elders.\n\nOverlake Christian Church began in Kirkland, Washington in 1969 with a handful of former attendees of Bellevue Christian Church. James Earl Ladd, then president of Puget Sound College of the Bible in the nearby city of Mountlake Terrace agreed to serve as a temporary, part-time pastor/preacher until a replacement could be found. A pastor from Enid, Oklahoma, Bob Moorehead, was invited and became Overlake's Senior Pastor in January, 1970. During the nearly thirty years of Moorehead's tenure, weekly attendance at the Kirkland church campus grew from less than a hundred to more than 6,000. He resigned in 1998 amid allegations of sexual impropriety, mostly related to the 1970s, that he had touched or fondled male members of the congregation. The elders of the church exonerated Moorehead in the results of their initial investigation, but a year after he resigned they withdrew their support, saying they had discovered new evidence that showed he \"did violate the scriptural standards of trust, self-control, purity and godly character required for the office of elder and pastor.\" As a conservative Christian, condemnation of homosexuality had been a major theme of his preaching.\n\nIn 1997, the church moved to a new 250,000 square foot (23,225 m²) building on along Willows Road NE in Redmond, Washington. After Moorehead's departure in June, 1998, the senior pastor's role was filled by Rick Kingham, a former Vice President of Promise Keepers, who led the congregation until February 2007. Mike Howerton, already on staff as a teaching pastor, became the church's lead pastor later that year.\n\nIn addition to the Bob Moorehead scandal, the church was again under public investigation in 2007, when $75,000 taken up as an offering from church members and visitors for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was instead used to pay church expenses, including salaries for pastors. Bob Senatore, then chairman of the board of elders, stated that the church has borrowed from restricted funds before, but the money ultimately was donated to disaster victims. However, some church members have stated that the money was only donated after congregational pressure.\n\nOverlake Christian Church has founded eight other churches in the area, the largest having more than 3,800 Sunday attendees.\n\n"}

The club was originally coached by Hubert Vogelsinger, but after he became ill midway through the season, Charlie Mitchell took over and served as player-coach for the remainder of the campaign. On the field, Hawaii had an 11-15 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs; at the box office, the team never came close to filling their 50,000-seat stadium.

He is best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling from 1999 to 2001.\n\nWright grew up in North Carolina and was an ardent fan of Jim Crockett Promotions, admiring wrestlers such as Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes and Bobby Eaton. Upon his graduation from high school in 1989, Wright was drafted by the San Diego Padres as a catcher, but rejected the offer, instead choosing to attend college, where he studied computing while playing baseball and softball.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Wright sought a new weekend sport to replace baseball. Several of his friends were wrestling professionally, and Wright decided to become a professional wrestler as well. With no formal training, he wrestled (and lost) his first match on December 4, 1993, under a mask as \"El Chico\". While wrestling on the independent circuit, Wright was approached by Pat and Rocky Anderson, who complimented him on his skills and appearance and offered him membership in the apocryphal Anderson family. Anderson spent two weeks trying to think of an appropriate forename, eventually settling on his initials, C.W., at the suggestion of an interviewer; he thus became C.W. Anderson. Anderson later met Ole Anderson but claimed that he was disillusioned by the experience. Anderson formed a tag team with Pat Anderson, winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship with him in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Anderson opened his own professional wrestling school in Smithfield, North Carolina, which he later named \"The Anderson Academy\" where he trained wrestlers such as Chilly Willy, Lodi and Toad. It was during this time that Anderson joined the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts, a promotion run by Matt and Jeff Hardy.\n\nIn 1998, Anderson trained at the World Championship Wrestling run Power Plant under DeWayne Bruce and Pez Whatley. While there he was told by J.J. Dillon and Paul Orndorff that he lacked the talent and physique to become successful as a wrestler. After spending eighteen months in the Power Plant without being utilized on WCW television, Anderson opted to leave the Power Plant, turning down a six-year WCW contract offer.\n\nOn June 6, 1999, Anderson accompanied a friend to an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) tryout in Georgia and was convinced to get in the ring by Nova. His work impressed ECW owner Paul Heyman, and Anderson was hired. In his first match for ECW, Anderson teamed with Skull Von Krush against Danny Doring and Roadkill.\n\nIn ECW, Anderson formed the New Dangerous Alliance with Billy Wiles, Elektra and Lou E. Dangerously. After that group separated, Anderson joined forces with Simon and Swinger.\n\nOn January 7, 2001 at the final ECW pay-per-view, Guilty as Charged, Anderson lost to Tommy Dreamer in an \"I Quit\" match. As part of his preparation for the bout, Anderson watched the \"I Quit\" match between Magnum T.A. and Tully Blanchard from Starrcade 1985.\n\nFollowing the closure of ECW, Anderson wrestled in Dusty Rhodes' Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling, where he formed The Extreme Horsemen, a stable modeled after The Four Horsemen, with Barry Windham and Steve Corino. The stable later wrestled in Major League Wrestling, where they were joined by P.J. Polaco and Simon Diamond. Anderson also wrestled for Ring of Honor and various independent promotions in North Carolina.\n\nFrom 2002 onwards, Anderson made numerous tours of Japan, most prominently for Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max (by May 2006, he had toured with the company on 36 separate occasions). In 2004, he was given a tryout match by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, but was not hired. On June 10, 2005, Anderson appeared at Hardcore Homecoming, an ECW reunion event organized by Shane Douglas. The event saw Anderson team with Simon Diamond in a loss to Chris Chetti and Mikey Whipwreck. He went on to appear at Hardcore Homecoming events in September 2005 and November 2005.\n\nAnderson was hospitalized in 2005 after a supplement named Superdrol gave him jaundice and caused his liver to stop functioning. He returned to the ring after several months, during which he lost 40 lb (18 kg) in weight.\n\nThroughout 2004 and 2005, Anderson made numerous appearances with World Wrestling Entertainment, wrestling in dark matches and on \"Velocity\". On June 12, 2005, he appeared at the WWE promoted ECW reunion show ECW One Night Stand, sitting at ringside next to Chris Chetti and Elektra.\n\nOn May 4, 2006, Anderson and several other Extreme Championship Wrestling alumni were hired by WWE to work on their new brand, ECW. Throughout June and July, Anderson wrestled at ECW house shows and in \"ECW on Sci Fi\" dark matches. On August 1, he became known as Christopher W. Anderson. He made what would be his only ECW television appearance on August 22, 2006, losing to CM Punk. Anderson was released by WWE on January 18, 2007, along with ten other superstars.\nCW Anderson then worked in independent promotions including Vanguard Championship Wrestling where he defeated TNA wrestler Sonjay Dutt. CW re-debuted recently working for NWA Charlotte. Anderson showed up dropping 40 lbs attributing it to his new workout P90x. On April 25, 2009 he worked for GSW German Stampede Wrestling at International Impact losing to \"Bad Bones\" John Kay. On June 27, 2009, he appeared at an ECW type reunion show called \"Legends of the Arena\" and wrestled against 2 Cold Scorpio. On August 4, 2010, it was confirmed that Wright would be taking part in TNA's ECW reunion show, Hardcore Justice, on August 8. At the event he was defeated by 2 Cold Scorpio. CW Anderson was announced for the 2nd ever match of the new Extreme Reunion organization; which is conceived as a continuation of the original Extreme Championship Wrestling. His opponent was announced as ECW Alumnus, Al Snow. On June 29, Extreme Rising's 2nd show in Queens, NY, CW lost a match against \"Pitbull\" Gary Wolfe. The following night, in Philadelphia, he lost a match to Balls Mahoney and had a confrontation with The Sandman. In 2013, Anderson performed in OMEGA. On January 15, James Storm, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy & Shane Helms defeat CW Anderson, Gunner, Lodi & Steve Corino. On May 25, 2013, Matt Hardy & Shane Helms defeat CW Anderson & Steve Corino. On October 12, 2013, Anderson was defeated by Hardy in the first round for the OMEGA Championship. On October 5, 2013, at Vanguard Championship Wrestling, Anderson defeated Tommy Dreamer in an I Quit match. On November 30, 2013, at WrestleCade, Anderson was defeated by Dreamer in an I Quit match. Now he is the AWE heavyweight Champion after winning the title at Waynesboro Virginia High school.\n\nAnderson appeared on the December 17th episode of NWA Power and wrestled in a tournament qualifying match for the NWA TV Title. He wrestled against Sal Rinauro and Zicky Dice in a Triple Threat, in which Zicky Dice won. On the March 3rd edition of Power, Anderson won a \"last chance match\" alongside Caleb Konley, defeating the Dawsons and earning a contract with the National Wrestling Alliance.\n\n"}

It is the fourth most populous municipality in Manitoba (behind the cities of Winnipeg, Brandon, and Steinbach) and most populous rural municipality in the province as of the Canada 2016 census.\n\nThe area of Hanover was part of the traditional lands of the Ojibway speaking natives. In the summer of 1871, the federal government signed treaties with these people putting them on reserves like the Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation to the south and the Brokenhead Ojibway Nation to the north.\n\nFrom these lands, the Manitoba government set aside the East Reserve which was slightly smaller than what is now the R.M. of Hanover. The East Reserve was set aside for the new Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites immigrants from Russia coming to the province. In 1873, these Mennonites signed an agreement with the Canadian government known as the Privilegium guaranteeing land, freedom of religion, private schools, and military exemption.. In 1880, the province created the Rural Municipality of Hespeler in honour of William Hespeler, who had brought many of the Mennonite immigrants to the area. The R.M. of Hanover was created on May 25, 1881 during the same time when most of the province was reorganizing itself into new rural municipalities. The East Reserve was divided into two municipalities, Hespeler in the north and Hanover in the south. The two municipalities shared administrative staff and merged in 1890 to form the single municipality of Hanover.\n\nThe primary settlers were Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Russia, French, and Anglo-Saxons.\n\nTwo communities formerly part of Hanover are now separate urban municipalities. The city of Steinbach was first incorporated (as a town) in 1946. The town of Niverville incorporated in 1969. Hanover's municipal headquarters were located in Steinbach until a new office building near Mitchell was constructed in 2001.\n\nHanover has seen steady population growth in recent years and is currently the most populated rural municipality in Manitoba, slightly ahead of the R.M. of Springfield. It has population of 15,733 as of the Canada 2016 census, which is a 12.2% increase from 2011. The population density of 21.2/km is up from 16.0 in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

Toronto's record for the 1967 season was a bearable 10-5-17. The following season, the NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association to form the NASL. Their intercity rival, Toronto City, of USL folded in the process after only one year.\n\nIn the NASL, with the legendary László Kubala as their coach, the Falcons played well collecting a 13-6-13 record, but financial troubles caused the club (along with 11 others) to fold.

Dniproavia announced a loss of just over 6 million USD for 2006, despite increasing revenues by 17 percent and carrying 54 percent more passengers. It blamed the loss on the suspension of its flights to Germany, due to a dispute with the German authorities over Lufthansa's landing rights at Dnipropetrovsk Airport. In October 2009, the airline was sold to Galtera investment group, however, it was controlled by Ukrainian-Israeli entrepreneur Ihor Kolomoyskyi's Privat Group.\n\nAs of 25 March 2012, as a result of the Anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine's decision to allow the consolidation of the Ukrainian Aviation Group's physical and operational assets, Dniproavia no longer operates flights with its own code, but rather on behalf of its parent company Aerosvit.

Together with fortress Terezín, it was intended as protection against attacks from Prussia, but its military importance, like other such fortresses built across Europe, was minimal as decisive battles were often fought elsewhere. Since 1948 it is part of the city of Jaroměř.\n\nAfter the coronation of Emperor Joseph II, new fortifications began to be built for the defence of the northern border of the Empire. The defence of Moravia was entrusted to Olomouc, which was fortified by powerful forts. When the work was completed, the fortification of Hradec Králové began in the years 1766-88. The Emperor Joseph II himself had the Josefov fortress to be built around the area of Plesy, near the town of Jaroměř.\n\nDesigned by the French architect Louis Querlonde de Hamel and fortified by octagonal-shaped, bastion-like brick walls extending over 289 hectares, the fortress is an ingenious system of fortifications in the form of an amphitheatre with extensive three-storeys deep underground corridors formed in cretaceous rocks, and running for a labyrinth of 45 kilometers, like of which cannot be found anywhere else in Europe. It had three distinct sections - the main fortress with its residential and public function, the lower Crown fortress with a fortified island, and a forward redoubt in the fortress Brdce. The town had four gates. The dominant part of the whole Fortress Josefov is the Empire Church, which was built between 1805-10. It was designed by Heinrich Hatzinger, Julius D’Andreis and Franz Joseph Fohmann. Before that, there stood a fountain, which was made by the Czech J. Malinský in the year 1817.\n\nThe Josefov fortress was originally named Ples, and only later, in 1793, was it renamed Josefov. In 1948 the fortress town was incorporated into Jaroměř and today, both fortress and town, are part of a national conservation area preserving 18th-century military building techniques and classicist urbanism.\n\nOver the years, the fortress has been converted into a residential district. The biggest extreme metal music festival in Central Europe Brutal Assault takes place here each August, with the music stages built against the outer walls. Metalheads from all over Europe occupy the fortress for three days each year.\n"}
{"id": "1955868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955868", "title": "Golden Rule savings rate", "text": "Golden Rule savings rate\n\nIn economics, the Golden Rule savings rate is the rate of savings which maximizes steady state level or growth of consumption, as for example in the Solow growth model. Although the concept can be found earlier in John von Neumann and Maurice Allais's works, the term is generally attributed to Edmund Phelps who wrote in 1961 that the golden rule \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" could be applied inter-generationally inside the model to arrive at some form of \"optimum\", or put simply \"do unto future generations as we hope previous generations did unto us.\"\n\nIn the Solow growth model, a steady state savings rate of 100% implies that all income is going to investment capital for future production, implying a steady state consumption level of zero. A savings rate of 0% implies that no new investment capital is being created, so that the capital stock depreciates without replacement. This makes a steady state unsustainable except at zero output, which again implies a consumption level of zero. Somewhere in between is the \"Golden Rule\" level of savings, where the savings propensity is such that per-capita consumption is at its maximum possible constant value. Put another way, the golden-rule capital stock relates to the highest level of permanent consumption which can be sustained.\n\nThe following arguments are presented more completely in Chapter 1 of Barro and Sala-i-Martin and in texts such as Abel \"et al.\".\n\nLet \"k\" be the capital/labour ratio (i.e., capital per capita), \"y\" be the resulting per capita output ( formula_1 ), and \"s\" be the savings rate. The steady state is defined as a situation in which per capita output is unchanging, which implies that \"k\" be constant. This requires that the amount of saved output be exactly what is needed to (1) equip any additional workers and (2) replace any worn out capital.\n\nIn a steady state, therefore: formula_2, where \"n\" is the constant exogenous population growth rate, and \"d\" is the constant exogenous rate of depreciation of capital. Since \"n\" and \"d\" are constant and formula_3 satisfies the Inada conditions, this expression may be read as an equation connecting \"s\" and \"k\" in steady state: any choice of \"s\" implies a unique value for \"k\" (thus also for \"y\") in steady state. Since consumption is proportional to output ( formula_4 ), then a choice of value for \"s\" implies a unique level of steady state per capita consumption. Out of all possible choices for \"s\", one will produce the highest possible steady state value for \"c\" and is called the \"golden rule\" savings rate.\n\nAn important question for policy-makers is whether the economy is saving too much or too little. Given the interconnection of \"s\" and \"k\" in steady state, noted above, the question can be phrased: \"How much capital per worker (k) is needed to achieve the maximum level of consumption per worker in the steady state?\"\n\nTo discover the optimal capital/labour ratio, and thus the golden rule savings rate, first note that consumption can be seen as the residual output that remains after providing for the investment that maintains steady state: formula_5\n\nDifferential calculus methods can identify which steady state value for the capital/labour ratio maximises per capita consumption. The golden rule savings rate is then implied by the connection between \"s\" and \"k\" in steady state (see above).\n\nIn detail, if formula_6 is the golden rule steady state level of \"k\", then formula_7 requires formula_8, i.e. formula_9\n\nformula_10\n\nThe Inada conditions ensure that this rule is satisfied by a unique formula_7 and thus produces a unique formula_12. Since steady state requires a particular level of investment, i.e., saved output: formula_13, then the \"golden rule\" savings rate must be whatever is required to generate this;\n\nformula_14\n\nGiven the rule for optimal \"k\", this may also be expressed as\n\nformula_15\n\nin which formula_16 is the marginal product of capital ( formula_17 ) at the optimal value of \"k\" and formula_18 is the corresponding average product of capital ( formula_19 )\n\nThe actual values of formula_6, formula_21, formula_18, and formula_23 depend upon the precise specification of the production function formula_24. For example, a Cobb–Douglas specification with constant returns to scale has formula_25, hence formula_26 and formula_27. This gives formula_28 and hence formula_29, formula_30.\n\nVarious economic policies can have an effect on the savings rate and, given data about whether an economy is saving too much or too little, can in turn be used to approach the Golden Rule level of savings. Consumption taxes, for example, may reduce the level of consumption and increase the savings rate, whereas capital gains taxes may reduce the savings rate. These policies are often known as savings incentives in the west, where it is felt that the prevailing savings rate is \"too low\" (below the Golden Rule rate), and consumption incentives in countries like Japan where demand is widely considered to be too weak because the savings rate is \"too high\" (above the Golden Rule).\n\nJapan's high rate of private saving is offset by its high public debt. A simple approximation of this is that the government has borrowed 100% of GDP from its own citizens backed only with the promise to pay from future taxation. This does not necessarily lead to capital formation through investment (if the revenue from bond sales is spent on present government consumption rather than infrastructure development, say).\n\nIf consumption tax rates are expected to be permanent then it is hard to reconcile the common hypothesis that rising rates discourage consumption with rational expectations (since the ultimate purpose of saving is consumption. However, consumption taxes tend to vary (e.g., with changes in government or movement between countries), and so currently high consumption taxes may be expected to go away at some point in the future, creating an increased incentive for saving. The efficient level of capital income tax in the steady state has been studied in the context of a general equilibrium model and Judd (1985) has shown that the optimal tax rate is zero. However, Chamley (1986) says that in reaching the steady state (in the short run) a high capital income tax is an efficient revenue source.\n"}

The party was centrist-socialist on economic issues and conservative to moderate-conservative on social issues. In early 1990, an open conflict erupted between the conservative and centrist wings within the Citizens' Parliamentary Party (\"Obywatelski Klub Parlamentarny\") formed by Sejm members from the ranks of the oppositional, trade-unionist Solidarity Citizens' Committee (\"Komitet Obywatelski Solidarność\"); Lech Wałęsa dubbed this conflict, which he actively fomented, the \"war at the top\" (\"wojna na górze\").\n\nOn 12 May 1990, the conservative- socialist faction led by Jarosław Kaczyński formed a new party of their own, the Centre Agreement (\"Porozumienie Centrum\", PC), which was going to support Wałęsa in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nIn response to this, the centrist and Christian democratic faction, which favoured Christian democrat Tadeusz Mazowiecki as president, decided to establish the Citizens Movement 'Democratic Action'. Formed in July 1990, this was a regular, structured party rather than a loosely knit movement as its name suggests.

However, many ROAD members refused to back this decision; most notably co-founder Zbigniew Bujak, who proposed to take a more social-democratic direction and formed the Democrat-Social Movement (\"Ruch Demokratyczno-Społeczny\", RDS) instead.\n"}

O'Neill.\n\nIn 1987 the L5 Society merged with the National Space Institute to form the National Space Society.\n\nThe name comes from the and Lagrangian points in the Earth–Moon system proposed as locations for the huge rotating space habitats that O'Neill envisioned. and are points of stable gravitational equilibrium located along the path of the Moon's orbit, 60 degrees ahead or behind it.\n\nAn object placed in orbit around (or ) will remain there indefinitely without having to expend fuel to keep its position, whereas an object placed at , or (all points of unstable equilibrium) may have to expend fuel if it drifts off the point.\n\nO'Neill's first published paper on the subject, \"The Colonization of Space\", appeared in the magazine \"Physics Today\" in September 1974. A number of people who later became leaders of the Society got their first exposure to the idea from this article. Among these were a couple from Tucson, Arizona, Carolyn Meinel and Keith Henson. The Hensons corresponded with O'Neill and were invited to present a paper on \"Closed Ecosystems of High Agricultural Yield\" at the 1975 Princeton Conference on Space Manufacturing Facilities, which was organized by O'Neill.\n\nAt this conference, O'Neill merged the Solar Power Satellite (SPS) ideas of Peter Glaser with his space habitat concepts.\n\nThe Hensons incorporated the Society in August 1975, and sent its first 4-page newsletter in September to a sign up list from the conference and O'Neill's mailing list. The first newsletter included a letter of support from Morris Udall (then a contender for US president) and said \"our clearly stated long range goal will be to disband the Society in a mass meeting at .\"\n\nThe peak of 's influence was the defeat of the Moon Treaty in the U.S. Senate in 1980 (\"... L-5 took on the biggest political fight of its short life, and won\"). Specifically, Society activists campaigned for awareness of the provisions against any form of sovereignty or private property in outer space that would make space colonization impossible and the provisions against any alteration of the environment of any celestial body prohibiting terraforming. Leigh Ratiner [a Washington lawyer/lobbyist] \"played the key role in the lobbying effort, although he had energetic help from L-5 activists, notably Eric Drexler and Christine Peterson.\"\n\nAlthough economic analysis indicated the SPS/space colony concept had merit, it foundered on short political and economic horizons and the fact that the transport cost to space was about 300 times too high for individuals to fund when compared to the Plymouth Rock and Mormon colonies.\n\nIn 1986, the Society, which had grown to about 10,000 members, merged with the 25,000 member National Space Institute, to form the present-day National Space Society. The National Space Institute had been founded in 1972 by Wernher von Braun, the former German rocket engineer of the WW II Nazi V-2 rocket/ballistic missile program, and of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Project Apollo program manager.\n\nWhile the Society failed to achieve the goal of human settlements in space, it served as a focal point for many of the people who later became known in fields such as nanotechnology, memetics, extropianism, cryonics, transhumanism, artificial intelligence, and tether propulsion, such as K. Eric Drexler, Robert Forward, and Hans Moravec.\n\nThe \"L5 News\" was the newsletter of the Society reporting on space habitat development and related space issues. The News was published from September 1975 until April 1987, when the merger with the National Space Institute was completed and the newly formed National Space Society began publication of its own magazine, \"Ad Astra\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1955932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955932", "title": "Lukas Podolski", "text": "Lukas Podolski\n\nLukas Josef Podolski (; born Łukasz Józef Podolski () on 4 June 1985) is a German professional footballer who plays as a forward for Turkish side Antalyaspor. He is regarded as one of the best German players of his generation, and among the best finishers in world football. Famed for his extremely powerful and accurate left foot, he is known for his explosive shot, technique and probing attacks from the left side.\n\nHe joined 1. FC Köln in 1995 where he made it into the first team in 2003 resulting in 81 appearances for the club before moving to Bayern Munich. With Bayern, Podolski won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double in 2008. Podolski returned to 1. FC Köln in 2009. He later signed for Premier League club Arsenal in 2012, with whom he won the FA Cup in 2014. He then moved on loan to Serie A club Inter Milan in January 2015, before signing six months later for Galatasaray where he also won the Türkiye Kupası of 2016.\n\nPodolski was eligible to play for Germany and Poland. Podolski originally wanted to play for the Polish team but was rejected by then Polish coach Paweł Janas in 2003. Podolski enjoyed great success with the German national team. He was first capped by Germany in 2004 and was a part of the squad in seven major tournaments, winning the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He is the third most-capped player in German history, with 130 caps, and the third-highest goalscorer in German history, having scored 49 times.\n\nOn 29 May 2013, Podolski scored the fastest goal in German national team history, after just nine seconds of the 4–2 friendly win over Ecuador. It was at that time the second fastest international goal in history, second only to San Marino's Davide Gualtieri's 8.3-second strike against England in 1993. Podolski retired from international football on 22 March 2017 after scoring the winner in a friendly against England.\n\nPodolski began playing football at the age of six in the youth team of FC 07 Bergheim, where he played until he joined 1. FC Köln at the age of ten. It was there that Podolski's talents were first noticed. In 2003, at the age of 18, Podolski was still part of the club's youth side. At this time the club found itself in dire straits battling to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga. First team boss Marcel Koller, working on a shoestring budget, invited Podolski to train with the senior players and he made his top flight debut shortly afterwards on 22 November 2003. Even though Köln failed to avoid a drop to the 2nd division, Podolski had shown what he could do, scoring 10 goals in his first 19 senior appearances. This was the best tally by an 18-year-old in the history of the Bundesliga.\n\nThough his call up to the German Euro 2004 squad brought along interest from several top clubs, Podolski stayed at Köln to help the club gain promotion in the 2004–05 season. With 24 goals, Podolski advanced to become the league's best scorer. Somewhat unusually, Podolski remained part of the Germany squad, even though he did not play in the national top-tier league.\n\nAfter Köln were promoted, the pressure was on Podolski to keep the club in the Bundesliga practically singlehandedly. Podolski managed to score 12 goals in the 2005–06 season, but eventually, Köln were relegated again. It became clear that Podolski would not stay again to push them through the 2006–07 season—even more so, as Podolski was becoming an integral part of the national team.\n\nIn 2006, clubs such as Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Hamburger SV, Werder Bremen, and Real Madrid manifested their interest in Podolski, even though he had a contract with 1. FC Köln through 2007. On 1 June 2006, Podolski announced that a transfer agreement had been reached with Bayern Munich, allowing him to join the Bavarian side for the 2006–07 season. Financial details of the deal were not immediately available, but the transfer fee was speculated to be around €. He made his Bundesliga debut for Bayern on 11 August 2006, coming on as a substitute in the 88th minute of a 2–0 victory against Borussia Dortmund. On 9 September 2006, he came on as a second-half substitute in a DFB-Pokal game versus FC St. Pauli. Only 26 seconds after the second half started, he scored the equaliser, levelling the match at 1–1. On 14 October 2006, with his first Bundesliga goal for Bayern, Podolski helped to secure the club's 4–2 win over Hertha BSC. On 26 October 2006, Podolski suffered a serious injury to his right ankle joint caused by teammate, Mark van Bommel, during a training session. Consequently, Podolski missed more than five match weeks. He returned from this injury and scored against Alemannia Aachen.\n\nAfter Bayern bought in Italian striker Luca Toni in 2007, Podolski received less playing time due to coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's preference to partner Miroslav Klose and Toni together instead. However, Bayern ended the 2007–08 season by winning a league and cup double, giving Podolski the first major silverware of his career.\n\nDespite former national team coach Jürgen Klinsmann taking charge of Bayern for the 2008–09 season, Podolski again failed to break into the team's regular first choice line-up. After a rather unhappy spell at Bayern, he returned to former club Köln on 1 July 2009.\n\nAfter Podolski was assured by national team coach Joachim Löw that a return to FC Köln would not harm his chances of international football, an agreement to sign him was agreed between Bayern Munich and Köln in January 2009, although he would not return to Köln until the start of the summer transfer window. On 1 July, Podolski returned to Köln on a four-year contract, at a reported fee of around €10 million, equivalent to the fee Bayern paid to sign him in 2006. Köln created a website where people were able to buy pixels of an image of Podolski for €25 per 8x8 pixel square, in order to gather €1 million to reduce the cost of the transfer; Formula One driver and Köln supporter Michael Schumacher bought several pixels for €875.\n\nHaving just moved from Bayern Munich, Podolski had a poor first season at Köln, scoring just three times the entire season. One of his goals however, came from a free kick against his former club to salvage a draw.\n\nIn the 2010–11 season, Podolski scored his 50th Bundesliga goal in the match against Hannover 96 in March 2011. Throughout the entire season, Podolski scored 13 goals and made seven assists.\n\nThe 2011–12 season was the final season in his second spell for Köln. Despite the team's relegation to the 2. Bundesliga, Podolski scored 18 goals in 29 league Bundesliga appearances.\n\nOut of respect for his loyalty and achievements for the club, 1. FC Köln chose to retire his famous No. 10 shirt as long as he is an active football player. However, Köln began assigning the number 10 shirt again at the start of the 2014–15 Bundesliga season.\n\nPodolski was linked with Premier League club Arsenal throughout the 2012 winter transfer window but no deal materialised. However, on 30 April 2012, it was officially announced that Podolski had signed for Arsenal on a long-term deal, for an undisclosed fee. On 12 August 2012, Podolski started for Arsenal in a pre-season match against his former club, Köln, scoring twice, once from a penalty in a 4–0 victory. Podolski took the number 9 from Park Chu-Young, who had been loaned out to Celta Vigo, after the number 10 shirt vacated by Robin van Persie was given to Jack Wilshere. Podolski then started in his first official match for Arsenal against Sunderland on the opening day of the Premier League on 18 August 2012. He played 63 minutes before being subbed off for another 2012 summer signing, Olivier Giroud, in the match which finished 0–0. He scored his first goal for Arsenal on 2 September in a 2–0 win against Liverpool at Anfield whilst also providing the assist for Santi Cazorla to score his first for the Gunners. Podolski scored his second goal for Arsenal in the following game, scoring a free-kick from 25 yards in a 6–1 victory against Southampton.\n\nOn 18 September 2012, he scored his first UEFA Champions League goal for the Gunners in a 2–1 away win against Montpellier. In Arsenal's second game in the Champions League, Podolski scored again as Arsenal defeated Greek champions Olympiacos 3–1 on 3 October. Podolski then scored his first goal in more than a month against Fulham in a thrilling 3–3 draw. On 17 November, Podolski scored his fourth League goal as Arsenal defeated Tottenham 5–2 in the North London derby. He then helped Arsenal qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League by scoring the second goal as Arsenal beat Montpellier 2–0. Podolski then played a pivotal part in an impressive 5–2 win away from home against Reading at the Madejski Stadium, scoring the first goal and assisting 2 more, which had helped teammate Santi Cazorla to score his first ever hat-trick. On 30 December 2012, Podolski played an integral part of the team that beat Newcastle 7–3. His first contribution was an incisive pass to Theo Walcott for Arsenal's first goal. In addition, due to Newcastle's failure to clear the ball off their line, Podolski pounced on a header for his last goal of 2012. He was substituted for Aaron Ramsey to a standing ovation. On 23 January 2013, Podolski produced an impressive performance as Arsenal beat West Ham 5–1, scoring one goal and setting up three others. On 2 February 2013, Podolski scored the only goal via a deflected free-kick to earn the Gunners a 1–0 victory over Stoke City. On 13 April, Podolski sealed a 3–1 win over Norwich City by scoring his first goal since February. After Giroud's three-game ban appeal was rejected, Podolski began playing as a centre forward, starting with the 1–1 draw against Manchester United. Podolski then scored twice in a 4–1 victory over Wigan Athletic, resulting in Wigan's relegation from the Premier League. Podolski ended his first season in Arsenal with a total of 16 goals and 11 assists.\n\nOn 24 August 2013, Podolski netted his first goals of the 2013–14 season, scoring twice for Arsenal away at Fulham in a 3–1 win. However, he was injured in his next match in the Champions League qualifier against Fenerbahçe and was ruled out for 10 weeks.\nPodolski returned for Arsenal against West Ham United in a 3–1 win on Boxing Day, scoring the team's third goal in the 79th minute. Podolski netted his first two goals in 2014 with a brace in a 4–0 FA Cup fourth round win over Coventry City. He later scored in a 2–1 FA Cup win over Liverpool in February to send Arsenal through to the quarter-finals of the competition.\n\nPodolski scored two goals in March as he began to feature more regularly in the Gunners starting line-up. His first was a goal against his former club, FC Bayern Munich, in the return leg of the UEFA Champions League last 16 tie. Podolski's goal proved nothing more than a consolation, as Arsenal crashed out of Europe, losing 3–1 on aggregate to the defending champions.\n\nHis second goal in March was an equaliser against Swansea City in the Premier League clash. A minute after scoring, Podolski provided an assist for teammate Olivier Giroud, who gave Arsenal a 2–1 lead. However, a last minute own goal by Mathieu Flamini meant the game finished 2–2 and effectively ended Arsenal's hopes of lifting the Premier League title for another season.\n\nArsenal qualified for the FA Cup final on 12 April following a win against Wigan, in which Podolski was substituted after 68 minutes. He scored twice in Arsenal's next game, a 3–1 win against West Ham United at the Emirates Stadium and followed that display up with another brace in Arsenal's next game, a 3–0 win away to Hull City. He started in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Hull City and left the pitch for Yaya Sanogo after 61 minutes as Hull led Arsenal 1–2. Arsenal went on to win the game 3–2 after extra time, thereby ending the club's nine-year trophy drought.\n\nAfter winning the World Cup for Germany, Podolski and compatriots Per Mertesacker and Mesut Özil were excused by Arsenal from the 2014 Community Shield, which they won 3–0 against Manchester City.\n\nIn November, Podolski spoke about his unrest with his current role with Arsenal and his lack of game time, saying: \"Of course I am not happy with my situation right now. I can't be satisfied with that. It is hard when you can't do what you love.\"\n\nOn 5 January 2015, Arsenal announced that Podolski had completed a move to Serie A club Inter Milan on loan for the remainder of the 2014–15 season. He joined the side for training after the deal was finalised ahead of their league match away to Juventus on 6 January. In the 1–1 draw at the Juventus Stadium, he came on as a substitute for Zdravko Kuzmanović after 54 minutes. Podolski was not named in Inter's squad list for the knockout stages of the UEFA Europa League with coach Roberto Mancini preferring Xherdan Shaqiri over the German international. On 28 April 2015, Podolski scored his only goal with Inter to win the match 2–1 in the 65th minute against Udinese.\n\nPodolski signed a three-year contract with Turkish club Galatasaray on 4 July 2015 for an initial fee of £1.8 million, after which the Süper Lig champions will pay Arsenal £2.1 million for three consecutive seasons thereafter. He instantly won the Turkish Super Cup. In the final of the Turkish Cup on 26 May 2016, he scored the decisive goal for Galatasaray in the 1–0 win over Fenerbahçe.\n\nOn 2 March 2017, Podolski announced his transfer to Japanese club Vissel Kobe after the completion of the Turkish season. On 29 July 2017, he played his first match for Vissel Kobe and scored two goals in a 3–1 win over Omiya Ardija in the J1 League. On 11 August 2018, he assisted Andres Iniesta's first goal in the J1 League in a 2–1 win over Jubilo Iwata.\n\nOn 8 December 2019, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Júbilo Iwata. It was his first hat-trick in the J1 League.\n\nOn 1 January 2020, Podolski won his first trophy in Japan, starting in Vissel Kobe's 2–0 victory over Kashima Antlers in the final of the 2019 Emperor's Cup; it was also the club's first ever major trophy.\n\nOn 23 January 2020, Podolski joined Antalyaspor on a one-and-a-half-year contract.\n\nIn late 2003, after several impressive performances in his first few Bundesliga games, Polish media suggested then-Polish national team coach Paweł Janas should check Podolski out, as he was still eligible to play for Poland. Janas ignored the request stating in one of the press interviews that \"as for today we have much better strikers in Poland and I don't see a reason to call up a player just because he played one or two good matches in the Bundesliga. He's not even a regular starter at his club.\" By that time Podolski was still interested in representing Poland, but as the season progressed German media increasingly highlighted his performances to suggest he should be called up to the German national team. When his full potential was finally unveiled, he had already decided to represent Germany. At the end of the season Köln were relegated, but Podolski impressed so much, that he held his debut for Rudi Völler's Germany on 6 June 2004, at age 19, in Kaiserslautern against Hungary with a late substitute appearance. He had become the first second-division player since 1975 to break into the national team.\n\nPodolski played for Germany at Euro 2004, where he was the squad's youngest player. He made one substitute appearance in the game against the Czech Republic, when he came on for Torsten Frings at half-time.\n\nPodolski was selected in the Germany squad for the 2006 World Cup, where he partnered Miroslav Klose as the attack duo in the starting lineup. He scored his first World Cup goal in Germany's third group match against Ecuador, and both goals in the 2–0 win over Sweden in the round of 16. He became the first player since 1962 to score two goals in the first 12 minutes of a World Cup match and only the third player ever to accomplish the feat. Germany finished third in the tournament, and while his teammate Miroslav Klose won the Golden Boot competition, Podolski's three goals tied him for second place with Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Fernando Torres, David Villa, Maxi Rodríguez, Hernán Crespo and Zinedine Zidane. Podolski was named the World Cup's Best Young Player ahead of players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nIn a Euro 2008 qualifying game against San Marino in Serravalle Podolski netted four goals in Germany's record 13–0 thrashing. He is one of only four German players to score four goals in an international match. He was the third after Gerd Müller and Michael Ballack, and since this, Mario Gómez has accomplished this feat. In Germany's 4–1 win against Slovakia in Bratislava on 11 October 2006, he scored the first and the last German goal, both on assists by Miroslav Klose. He has continued to score goals at an astonishing rate. On 17 November 2007, in a Euro qualifier match against Cyprus, Podolski was involved in every goal in Germany's 4–0 victory. This was one of Podolski's best performances for the national team. Even though he played out of his natural position, playing at left midfield, he netted one goal himself and was voted Man of the Match.\n\nOn 8 June 2008, Podolski made his Euro 2008 entrance against debutants Poland in a Group B match in Klagenfurt, Austria. He scored both goals in a 2–0 victory. He avoided celebrating his goals, however, to show respect for his country of birth. After the game he gave an emotional interview on Polish television. The goals put him in the lead in the Euro 2008 goal-scoring list for two days until David Villa scored a hat-trick for Spain against Russia.\n\nOn 12 June, Germany played Croatia in their second Group B match, again in Klagenfurt. Podolski scored the German team's only goal of the game in the 79th minute, by which time the Croatians were already leading 2–0. He did not celebrate this goal either despite it putting him joint first on the Euro 2008 goal-scoring list with David Villa. Podolski's goal was not enough to snatch a draw, with Croatia holding out for a 2–1 victory over Germany. On 19 June, Germany played Portugal in the quarterfinal in Basel, Podolski was instrumental in the first goal, whipping a cross into the penalty box that was slotted home by Bastian Schweinsteiger in the 22nd minute to give Germany a 1–0 lead.\n\nOn the international scene, Podolski seems to be gravitating towards an attacking left midfield role from his traditional place as a striker. Initially, Löw had moved him to the wing in order to accommodate the partnership of Klose and Mario Gómez up front. When this backfired, he resumed his forward position in the UEFA Euro 2008 Final, but was unable to prevent Germany losing 1–0 to Spain. In a controversial incident, Podolski was headbutted by Spanish midfielder David Silva, although this went unnoticed by the referee and his assistants, and went unpenalised. Lukas Podolski was named in the 23-man squad as one of the players of the tournament along with countrymen Michael Ballack and Philipp Lahm.\n\nOn 6 September 2008, Podolski scored the opening two goals in Germany's first 2010 World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein in Vaduz; a match that ended in a 6–0 victory for the Germans. He scored the opener in the 2–1 home win over Russia on 11 October, when he turned Vasili Berezutski on the edge of the penalty area, before unleashing a powerful shot past Russia's goalkeeper Akinfeev. He finished the qualification campaign second highest scorer of Group 4 with six goals, behind teammate Miroslav Klose's 7. During one of the qualifying matches, he was involved in a bust-up with team captain Michael Ballack.\n\nOn 13 June 2010, Podolski, who had become accustomed to his position as a winger scored the first goal in Germany's World Cup opening game in a 4–0 win against Australia, before assisting teammate Thomas Müller for the third goal. On 18 June, Podolski missed a second-half penalty after a handling infraction committed by Nemanja Vidić in the 1–0 loss to Serbia. The German team had gone down to 10-men after a second yellow was shown to Miroslav Klose in the 36th minute. Even though the Germans played with 10-men throughout the rest of the game, Podolski had numerous chances on goal. However, he was unable to capitalize, and the game ended in a surprise defeat for the Germans. However, he managed to score against England in the last 16, giving Germany a 2–0 advantage in the first half. They went on to beat England 4–1. In the quarter-final against Argentina, Podolski provided the assist for the first of Klose's two goals, bringing the score to 2–0. The Germans won the match 4–0.\n\nDuring qualification, Podolski provided assists for three goals and scored three times, helping Germany to win all ten matches of their qualification campaign. During Euro 2012, Podolski started all three of Germany's Group B games, the third being his 100th appearance for Germany; a game in which he also scored. Podolski's last game at Euro 2012 was against the Italian national team in the semi-finals where Germany were defeated 2–1.\n\nPodolski was part of Germany's 2014 World Cup campaign. Prior to the tournament, he played in five qualification matches. In the World Cup finals in Brazil, he appeared in the victories over USA and Portugal in the group stages, but did not play the full 90 minutes. Germany went on to become World Champions.\n\nPodolski was included in the squad for UEFA Euro 2016. He made a substitute appearance against Slovakia during the tournament. After the tournament, on 15 August, he announced his retirement from international football (effective 23 March 2017) saying he wants to shift his focus and spend more time with his family. He was given his last ever international appearance for Germany against England on 22 March 2017 where he scored the winning goal.\n\nPodolski possesses an explosive and accurate shot, reaching speeds of nearly . Arsene Wenger described Podolski saying \"He's certainly one of the best finishers I've ever seen...If there's one you want to see in front of the goal in a shooting position, it's him\". In his early years, Podolski possessed explosive speed with great acceleration which was later affected by some lengthy injuries. He usually cuts inside either to shoot or pass the ball. Podolski is a physically strong player able to hold up the ball and produce key passes. Podolski has good dribbling and technical skills and is also a good crosser of the ball having set up many goals for his teammates from the left side. He is a penalty specialist, having missed only two penalties in his career.\n\nKöln\n\nBayern Munich\n\nArsenal\n\nGalatasaray\n\nVissel Kobe\n\nGermany\n\nIndividual\n\nPodolski is the founder of Lukas Podolski Foundation for Sport and Education (\"Lukas Podolski Stiftung für Sport und Bildung\") whose goals are to give prospects to socially disadvantaged children and young people, to fight child poverty, and to promote social inclusion and integration and understanding among nations.\n\nHe is also an ambassador of the Christian Children's Fund the Ark (\"Die Arche\"). One of his projects is a community day care centre for children located in a distressed part of Praga-Północ district in Warsaw, Poland, opened in 2014. The facility is run by \"Arka Fundacja Dzieci\" sponsored by Podolski's foundation.\n\nPodolski was born to Waldemar Podolski and Krystyna Podolska in the Silesian industrial city of Gliwice near Katowice in Poland. Krystyna is a former member of the Poland national handball team.\n\nIn 1987, when Podolski was two years old, his family emigrated from Poland to West Germany and were given \"Aussiedler\" status as a result of his paternal grandparents having German citizenship prior to World War II (Gliwice was a part of Germany until 1945 as \"Gleiwitz\"). Podolski grew up in Bergheim, North Rhine-Westphalia, and later in Pulheim, both near Cologne.\n\nPodolski holds both German and Polish nationality, but has stated that he does not have a Polish passport. In an interview Podolski said that the Polish Football Association never cared about him until he started playing for the German under-21 team and received coverage in the media. At that point, Podolski arrived at the decision, but nevertheless \"there are two hearts beating\" in his chest. Podolski speaks Polish and sometimes communicated with Bayern Munich and Germany strike partner Miroslav Klose, also a Polish-born \"Aussiedler\", in Polish to hinder their opposition's understanding of their conversation. Podolski is a fan of KS Górnik Zabrze, a football team based from his place of birth.\n\nIn April 2011, Podolski married his longtime girlfriend Monika Puchalski in Cologne, Germany. They had a church wedding in Kamionna, Węgrów County, Poland in June 2011. They have a son, Louis Gabriel Podolski (born 14 April 2008) and a daughter, Maya (born 6 June 2016).\n\nPodolski owns an ice cream parlour and a kebab shop in Cologne.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1955934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955934", "title": "Queen sacrifice", "text": "Queen sacrifice\n\nIn chess, a queen sacrifice is a move giving up a queen in return for tactical, positional, or other compensation. \nIn his book \"The Art of Sacrifice in Chess\", Rudolf Spielmann distinguishes between \"real\" and \"sham\" sacrifices. A sham sacrifice leads to a and immediate benefit for the sacrificer, usually in the form of a quick checkmate (or perpetual check or stalemate if seeking a draw), or the recouping of the sacrificed after a forced . Since any amount of material can be sacrificed as long as checkmate will be achieved, the queen is not above being sacrificed as part of a combination.\n\nPossible reasons for a sham queen sacrifice include:\n\n\nOn the other hand, \"real\" sacrifices, according to Spielmann, are those where the compensation is not immediate, but more positional in nature. Because the queen is the most powerful piece (see chess piece relative value), positional sacrifices of the queen virtually always entail some partial material compensation (for example, sacrificing the queen for a rook and bishop).\n\nAn opportunity may arise where a player trades off his queen for other pieces which may together be of equal or greater value than the queen. Bent Larsen remarks that giving up the queen for a rook and two is sometimes called a \"queen sacrifice\", but since a rook plus two minor pieces is more valuable than the queen, he says it should not be considered a sacrifice.\n\nA celebrated game by Adolf Anderssen, the Immortal Game, featured a queen sacrifice as part of White's final mating combination. In the diagram position Anderssen gave up his queen with 22.Qf6+! to divert Black's knight: the game continued 22...Nxf6 23.Be7#. This is an example of a sham queen sacrifice, as the sacrifice resulted in checkmate only one move later. White was able to mate since his minor pieces were clustered around the Black king, while Black's pieces were either undeveloped or trapped in the white camp and so unable to defend.\nIn another celebrated game by Anderssen, the Evergreen Game, Anderssen once again sacrificed his queen for a mating combination, playing 21.Qxd7+!!. The game continued 21...Kxd7 22.Bf5+ Ke8 23.Bd7+ Kf8 24.Bxe7#. The game is another example of a sham queen sacrifice. Although Black is on the verge of checkmating White, his defences around his king are weak, so White was able to mate.\nFor an example of a \"real\" (positional) queen sacrifice, Rudolf Spielmann presented this game against Jorgen Moeller in Gothenburg 1920. In the first diagram Black threatens 9...Bg4 winning the queen, since it must not leave the f2-square unguarded under threat of checkmate. But Spielmann played 9.Nd2! allowing Black to win his queen, and after 9...Bg4 10.Nxe4 Bxf3 11.Nxf3 Qh6 12.Nf6+ Kd8 13.h4 the position in the second diagram was reached. White has only a knight and bishop for his queen and pawn, but his minor pieces are very active and the black queen is out of play. White won on move 28.\n\nA queen sacrifice can sometimes be used as a resource to draw. Here Herman Pilnik (White) is defending an endgame three pawns down, but played Qf2!, when Samuel Reshevsky (Black) had nothing better than ...Qxf2 stalemate.\nIn The Game of the Century, Bobby Fischer uncorked a sham queen sacrifice to obtain a winning material advantage. In the first diagram, White's king is stuck in the center and Black has control of the open e-file. Fischer ignored the threat to his queen and played 17...Be6!!. The game continued 18.Bxb6 Bxc4+ 19.Kg1 Ne2+ 20.Kf1 Nxd4+ 21.Kg1 Ne2+ 22.Kf1 Nc3+ 23.Kg1 axb6 24.Qb4 Ra4 25.Qxb6 Nxd1 and Black has emerged with a large material and positional advantage. He can threaten back-rank mate to win even more material; his pieces are coordinated and White's rook is trapped in the corner.\nIn the World Chess Championship 2016, Magnus Carlsen defeated Sergey Karjakin in the final tie-break game with the queen sacrifice 50.Qh6+!!. Either way the queen is captured, there is mate on the next move. 50...Kxh6 51.Rh8#, or 50...gxh6 51.Rxf7#.\n\n\nFamous games featuring a Queen sacrifice:\n\n"}

The town has around 12,500 inhabitants. \n\nThe town includes the Fortress Josefov, a separate entity until 1948.\n\nThe historic old town has been inhabited for more than a thousand years.

{"id": "1955950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955950", "title": "Giorgio Chinaglia", "text": "Giorgio Chinaglia\n\nGiorgio Chinaglia (; 24 January 1947 – 1 April 2012) was an Italian footballer who played as a striker. He grew up and played his early football in Cardiff, Wales, and began his career with Swansea Town in 1964. He later returned to Italy to play for Massese, Internapoli and S.S. Lazio in 1969. Chinaglia led Lazio to the club's first league championship in the 1973–74 season, during which he was also the league's leading scorer. He played international football for Italy, making 14 appearances and scoring 4 goals between 1972 and 1975, including two appearances at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. Chinaglia was the first player in Italian football history to be called up internationally from the second division.\n\nIn 1976, Chinaglia left Lazio to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. With the Cosmos team that also featured Pelé and Franz Beckenbauer, Chinaglia won four league titles, and retired in 1983 as the NASL's all-time leading goal scorer with 193 goals. In 1980 Chinaglia scored a record 50 goals in regular and post season play, plus another 26 in friendly matches. In all matches played, including friendly, exhibition and pre-season games, Chinaglia scored 734 goals, giving him a lifetime average of a goal a game.\n\nIn 2000, Chinaglia was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in the United States and was named the greatest player in Lazio's history during the club's centenary celebrations; with 29 goals, he is also the highest scoring Lazio player in international competitions. A prolific goalscorer, some sources state that he is the highest scoring Italian player in all professional competitions, with 398 goals, ahead of Silvio Piola, although this claim is also disputed, as the NASL did not abide to certain FIFA regulations at the time. He is also the Italian player with the best goalscoring ratio in domestic championships, with 319 goals scored in 429 league matches played across both Italy and the United States.\n\nChinaglia was given the nickname \"Long John\", a reference to Chinaglia's physical style of play, as well as his resemblance to the similarly large Welsh footballing legend John Charles who also played in Italy.\n\nChinaglia was born in Carrara, Tuscany in 1947, but in 1955, he moved to Cardiff, Wales with his father Mario, mother Giovanna and his sister Rita, because of unemployment in Italy following World War II. Because his family was poor, Chinaglia said, \"All four of us lived in one room,\" he says, \"My father was an ironworker and it was tough. I used to take the milk left on people's porches and drink it for breakfast.\"\n\nAt age 13, Chinaglia was spotted scoring a hat trick for Cardiff Schools, and joined Swansea Town in the Football League Third Division as an apprentice in 1962.\n\nChinaglia made his senior debut for Swansea in October 1964 at Rotherham United, with his League debut following in February. His final Swans appearance was in March 1966, coming on as a substitute against Brentford.\n\nWith Swansea, Chinaglia won the 1965 West Wales Senior Cup, scoring in the 3–0 victory in the final against Llanelli, and represented the Swansea Senior Association Football League in 1964 in a representative match against the Birmingham & District Works Football Association.\n\nIn 1966, because of the lack of interest from British clubs and his compulsory Italian military service, Chinaglia, then age 19, and his family moved back to Carrara. He credited the military requirement with getting his career on track, saying, \"Otherwise, I'd probably still be in Wales, slogging it out in the mud and drinking ale. The Italian army has a special regiment for soccer players, so all I did in the service was to train all day, and when my club had a game, get a pass.\"\n\nChinaglia was banned from playing in Serie A, the top division, for three years because he had played professionally outside of Italy, and his father fixed him up with Massese, a Serie C club in Massa near his home.\n\nThe following season, he joined another Serie C club, Internapoli in Naples, where he played two seasons and scored 26 goals in 66 matches.\n\nChinaglia rose to fame as a prolific goalscorer in Italy's Serie A, playing for S.S. Lazio, scoring 12 goals in his debut Serie A season, including a notable goal against European Cup holders Milan, led by Gianni Rivera. He scored 9 goals in his second season, which was insufficient to prevent Lazio from being relegated to Serie B the following season. Despite Lazio's poor league form that year, Chinaglia won the Coppa delle Alpi with Lazio in 1971, defeating Basel 3–1 in the final. He helped Lazio to gain promotion to Serie A during the following season, leading the club to a second-place finish in Serie B that year, and finishing the season as the leading goalscorer in Serie B, with 21 goals. The following season, Chinaglia scored 10 goals in Serie A, as Lazio narrowly missed out on the title, losing it to Juventus on the final matchday. During the 1973–74 season, he led the top Italian league in scoring, with 24 goals, and he helped his team to the Serie A title that year, scoring the decisive goal from a penalty in a 1–0 win over Foggia. He was named the club's captain during his final season in Italy, concluding his European career with 14 goals. In total, he scored 98 league goals for Lazio in 209 appearances, 77 of which were scored in Serie A, in 175 appearances. He scored 122 goals in 246 appearances in all competitions for Lazio, scoring 13 goals in 28 Coppa Italia appearances, and 9 goals in 11 European matches.\n\nIn Rome, Chinaglia's family faced abuse from opposing fans and threats of kidnap by terrorist groups, and he voiced frustration at Italian tax and corporate laws that he said led to business failures. 1972, Chinaglia began investing in American real estate while on a tour of the United States with Lazio. And in 1975, his family bought a house in Englewood, New Jersey with the idea that he would commute to matches from there. Instead, he walked into the office of Clive Toye, then president of the New York Cosmos of NASL, and said he would either play for the Cosmos or buy his own team.\nChinaglia joined the Cosmos in 1976 and finished his career in New York with 397 goals in outdoor games and 38 goals in 21 indoor, a total of 435 goals in 413 matches. He led his team in scoring for 13 straight seasons, 6 at Lazio and 7 at the Cosmos, scored 2 or more goals 54 times for the Cosmos, of which 14 were playoff games, scored 3 or more goals in a game 16 times, 5 in the playoffs, and scored 7 goals in a playoff game against the Tulsa Roughnecks in 1980 as well as 7 goals in an indoor game against the Chicago Sting on 8 December 1981. Chinaglia won the NASL Most Valuable Player Award in 1981.\n\nChinaglia scored 49 goals in 41 playoff games for the Cosmos for his career and scored 5 goals in 5 Soccer Bowls, 3 of which were game winners (1977, 1978, and 1982).\n\nIn 1980 Chinaglia 76 goals in 66 total matches, including 32 goals in 32 regular season games and 18 goals in 7 playoff games. The NASL regular season record for most goals is also held by Chinaglia with 34 goals in 1978.\n\nIn December 1981, Chinaglia played indoor soccer, and in his first game against the Chicago Sting, he set an individual all-time NASL indoor record for most goals in a single match, by netting 7.\n\nHe also became a close associate of Warner Brothers president Steve Ross, part-owner of the franchise, and was known to thoroughly enjoy the cultural diversions that New York provided.\n\nIn 1984, Cosmos, facing mounting losses and having never turned a profit, sold 60 percent of the club's ownership to Chinaglia, with no money exchanging hands. Chinaglia, at that time Lazio's president, handed the controls to his personal assistant and general manager Peppe Pinton. When the league and the club folded in 1986, Pinton ended up retaining the rights to the Cosmos name and memorabilia, including trophies and playing gear, associated with the club.\n\nIn 2000, he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2014, the n° 9 jersey that Chinaglia had worn during his career at the Cosmos, was retired by the franchise.\n\nChinaglia's play with Lazio earned him a place on head coach Ferruccio Valcareggi's shortlist for the Italy squad in the 1970 FIFA World Cup. He did not make the final 22-man squad, but Valcareggi took him to Mexico for experience. Italy reached the final of the tournament.\n\nIn 1971, after Lazio were demoted to Serie B, Chinaglia became the first Italian national team player in modern history to be selected from a second-tier division club. Chinaglia scored on his debut in a friendly match against Bulgaria, on 21 June 1972, in Sofia.\n\nIn 1973, Chinaglia returned to Britain with the Azzurri to face England in a friendly match. In the 86th minute, Chinaglia beat English defender Bobby Moore and sent in a cross that was tapped in by Fabio Capello, helping Italy to its first win over England at Wembley Stadium.\n\nAlong with his teammates Re Cecconi and Wilson, Chinaglia took part in 1974 FIFA World Cup in Germany, although he was used scarcely by Italy manager Ferruccio Valcareggi. Chinaglia became notoriously famous for his strong verbal reaction when he cursed upon being substituted by Valcareggi for Anastasi during his nation's opening match of the tournament against Haïti, which ended in a 3–1 victory to the Italians, although they would later suffer a first round elimination from the competition. With his successor, Fulvio Bernardini, the situation did not improve. In total, he scored 4 goals for Italy in 14 appearances between 1972 and 1975.\n\nRegarded as one of the top and most prolific Italian strikers of all time, Chinaglia was a large, strong, fast, and powerful player, with a keen eye for goal. Often described as one of the first true old fashioned centre-forwards in Italy, his physical, determined, and opportunistic style of play was initially seen as unorthodox, but he developed into a prominent and prolific goalscorer. Chinaglia was known for his powerful and accurate shot, heading ability, and clinical finishing, both inside and outside the area, as well as his athletic and acrobatic ability in the air. Although he was not initially regarded as the most talented or technically gifted player, he developed his skill and control with time, showing great technical improvements and finesse later on in his career, which also led him to dribble with the ball at speed during counterattacks on occasion. He was also an accurate penalty taker.\n\nIn addition to his footballing attributes, Chinaglia was a confident, charismatic and highly influential player on the pitch, due to his flamboyant, outspoken, eccentric, and extroverted personality, as well as his unique sense of humour with his teammates, which led him to become one of the first true footballing stars. He was also known for his leadership throughout his career, in particular during his time at Lazio. However, despite his prolific goalscoring record, he was criticised at times for being selfish, arrogant, and for his limited work-rate off the ball. Although he was popular with fans and teammates, he also had a controversial, brash, and rebellious character, and an aggressive temper at times, which led to arguments and altercations with some of his managers and teammates throughout his career. He also drew negative attention to himself in the press due to his lifestyle off the pitch, which included certain legal problems throughout his career, as well as accusations of criminal activity.\n\nIn 1970, married his first wife, Connie Eruzione, daughter of a retired American army sergeant who was living in Italy and cousin of Mike Eruzione, member of the Gold Medal-winning 1980 United States men's national ice hockey team that won the \"Miracle on Ice\" game against the Soviet Union. They had three children together: Cynthia, Giorgio Jr. and Stephanie. After his divorce with his first wife, Chinaglia married Angela Cacioppo; they had two children: Anthony and Donald.\n\nIn 1979, Chinaglia became a naturalized American citizen, telling \"The New York Times Magazine\" reporter Diane Ackerman that he proudly kept his citizenship papers in his locker next to his bottle of Chivas Regal.\n\nIn 1996, Chinaglia was given a two-year prison sentence for fraudulent and false bankruptcy in the financial statements attributable to the management of Fin Lazio (1986–87), the financial owner of S.S. Lazio. He was Lazio's club president from 1983 to 1985, and was investigated by Italian authorities over a failed attempt to buy the club in 2006 over money laundering allegations involving suspected associates of the Casalesi clan, a clan of the Camorra crime syndicate. He had previously attempted to buy another Italian club, U.S. Foggia, in 2004, but that attempt also failed after money laundering allegations and he fled to the United States. In October 2006, Chinaglia was also accused of extortion and manipulation and an arrest warrant was issued by the Guardia di Finanza, but he remained a fugitive due to him residing in the United States. In November 2007, Chinaglia was fined €4.2 million by the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa for the alleged intention of a Hungarian chemical-pharmaceutical group to acquire the majority stake in S.S. Lazio. In July 2008, another arrest warrant was issued to Chinaglia. \"Football Show\" co-host Charlie Stillitano said Chinaglia never returned to Italy because \"He never wanted to take the chance\".\n\nAt the time of his death, Chinaglia was co-host of a daily soccer talk show, \"The Football Show\" on Sirius Satellite Radio.\n\nChinaglia died in Naples, Florida of a heart attack on 1 April 2012. His body was brought back to Rome for burial at Cimitero Flaminio, in the chapel of the Maestrelli family, where former Lazio coach Tommaso Maestrelli is buried. The Giorgio Chinaglia Foundation, a non-profit organization to help youth soccer programs and disabled children, was later formed by the three children from his first marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1955953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955953", "title": "Das Schwarze Korps", "text": "Das Schwarze Korps\n\nDas Schwarze Korps (; German for \"The Black Corps\") was the official newspaper of the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS). This newspaper was published on Wednesdays and distributed free of charge. Each SS member was encouraged to read it. The chief editor was SS leader Gunter d'Alquen; the publisher was Max Amann of the Franz-Eher-Verlag publishing company. The paper was hostile to many groups, with frequent articles condemning the Catholic Church, Jews, Communism, Freemasonry, and others.\n\nThe newspaper was published in close co-operation with the \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD; Security Service), which had substantial editorial control. The first edition appeared on 6 March 1935. In November of the same year, publication reached 200,000 and by 1944 had increased to 750,000. The newspaper saw some distribution outside Germany.\n\nFormed in 1935, \"Das Schwarze Korps\", was the official newspaper of the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS). The newspaper was created to be a defender of Nazism, to disseminate and promote the ideological messages of their organization and its leader, \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler. The paper was used to reinforce Himmler's beliefs, to identify and attack elements within German society that he found unacceptable, to boost morale among members of the SS, to combat anything considered to be pernicious enemies within the Nazi state, and to encourage the racial doctrine that \"pure-blooded Nordics must be bred\"—which included promoting the idea that it was partially the responsibility of members of the \"elite\" SS corps to correspondingly produce \"beautiful\" illegitimate children. Illegitimate births aside, marriage was depicted as an obligation to the state, part of the mechanism to establish a racially productive community in which individual happiness was of no importance.\n\nOn other occasions the paper served to inform its readers on the pseudo-scientific research Himmler commissioned to support his beliefs in the mystical powers of the ancient Germanic predecessors. In one edition, \"Das Schwarze Korps\" reported on the archaeological whereabouts (previously unknown) of Henry I's remains, claiming that, \"scientific evidence has established that the remains discovered during excavations in the crypt of Quedlinburg cathedral are in fact those of Henry I.\"\n\nBesides the esoteric pursuits of Himmler, the SS newspaper strongly criticized party leaders whose worldview differed from SS doctrine. Carefully crafted articles gave SS men and the other readers an elitist image of the organization. This by means of information about the SS, its activities and successes, which were constantly scattered throughout the paper. \"Das Schwarze Korps\" routinely contained foreign news reports, analyses of threats, and theoretical essays on Nazi policies. Praise for motherly women and families was contrasted with discrediting the women's movement of \"Amazons\" and women that the Nazis considered too manly. It had a strong pro-natalist slant, though at one point, it declared some tactics were excessive: an employee being publicly admonished by a superior to have children, to divorce or adopt. Anti-clerical articles appeared in the paper, many of which attacked senior members of the clergy, each article part of an effort to \"demolish the moral authority of the Catholic Church.\" Christian concepts like original sin were described as \"intolerable\" ideas that were \"incompatible\" with Nordic man and the otherwise \"heroic ideology\" about Germanic blood.\n\nThe paper also covered foreign press attacks with instructions on how to refute them. In accordance with doctrines of Blood and Soil, it spoke of the need to break up the aristocratic estates, although this was not implemented. Historian Amy Carney described \"Das Schwarze Korps\" as \"a conduit through which the SS was able to reveal its ambitions to the German people.\" \"Das Schwarze Korps\" provided members of the SS with articles reminding them of their need to \"be mindful of their family's biological heritage when marrying\" and for general readers, the paper demonstrated \"how dedicated its men were to their Führer and to the Reich and what an example they were setting for the entire Volk by adhering to the principles of eugenics.\"\n\nPrior to the passing of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, the paper called for a law to ban \"Rassenschande\" or intercourse between Jews and Germans, as preferable to the extra-legal violence that the SA Stormtroopers indulged in; after that edition, articles on the \"Jewish Question\" did not increase in number, but did grow more harsh in tone. Judicial leniency was either criticized or ridiculed and a 1937 issue explained the obligation of lawyers to protect the \"national community.\"\n\nIn the late 1930s, the paper featured an article written by physicist and Nobel Prize winner Johannes Stark, who argued that the racial, physical triumph of the Aryan over 'the Jew' would only be a \"partial victory\" unless Jewish ideas and sentiments were not also fully destroyed. Stark added that, \"we also have to eradicate the Jewish spirit, whose blood can flow just as undisturbed today as before if its carriers hold beautiful Aryan passes.\" In October 1938, an editorial argued that German Jews as \"are also responsible for whatever world Jewry undertakes against Germany\" and that they were also \"liable for the damages which world Jewry inflicts and will inflict upon us.\"\n\nA subsequent edition of \"Das Schwarze Korps\" communicated the harsh and foreboding message that if any single Jew harmed a German, they would all be held responsible, while another explicitly stated: \"The day a murder weapon that is Jewish or bought by Jews rises against one of the leading men of Germany, there will be no more Jews in Germany!\" Immediately in the wake of the carnage of \"Kristallnacht\", Nazi threats were becoming reality and the SS-sponsored paper cited among the reasons for their violence: anti-Semitism was prevalent in all racially healthy peoples for thousands of years, the Nazis were the only ones willing and \"tough enough\" to take effective and practical actions, and the international community was full of hypocrites who failed to help the Jews out—namely when they refused to offer them \"safe refuge.\" Additional propagandistic usage of the SS journal included the promotion of the cult of personality surrounding Adolf Hitler, as his portraits abounded within the text. A telling example of the adulation dedicated to the Nazi leader shows in the following extract from \"Das Schwarze Korps\":\n\nSuch deification of Hitler accompanied by anti-Semitic propaganda made the editorial staff of the SS newspaper a responsible entity in the institutional framework of the Holocaust. The newspaper itself is an indictment against the National Socialists collectively since it revealed even before the war that the SS was prepared to take radical action against the Jews. Besides praising Hitler, the paper made specious claims against any perceived enemy; for example, Jews were portrayed as having an inclination towards Bolshevism (a widely known enemy of the Nazi state) in \"Das Schwarze Korps\", indicated in the following excerpt from the 24 November 1938 edition:\n\nHate-speech from the editors of the SS newspaper portended the Jews' later fate. Despite the sweeping statements made in the official SS-journal, SD chief Reinhard Heydrich—among the leading perpetrators of the Holocaust—rarely appears within its pages, as he thought it was \"ill-organized and poorly written.\" This did not stop Heydrich from using the paper to reinforce his message that any and all dissenters to the Anschluss with Austria were to be arrested, whether or not they wore a Nazi uniform.\n\nMalleable to the political needs of the Nazi state, \"Das Schwarze Korps\" along with the \"Völkischer Beobachter\" were both used as propaganda mechanisms to promote the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany in August 1939. Commenting accordingly, the SS-newspaper optimistically asserted that the former tsarist empire \"had originally been a Germanic state\" that saved Prussia twice in the past, and the two countries \"had always flourished when they were friends.\"\n\nDuring the war, whenever the Waffen-SS would join the army in maneuvers, particularly at Hitler's behest, the instances were proudly reported in \"Das Schwarze Korps\". Deliberate propaganda efforts to bolster morale formed a notable portion of the content of the newspaper, especially in encouraging members of the SS and the public at large to remain prepared to report anyone who might oppose the war effort. For example, a 1943 article told the story of a soldier on leave from Stalingrad who overheard an old woman thought to be mentally impaired complaining about the war; the paper encouraged extreme action against people like this, calling them \"cowardly traitors\" and claiming in no uncertain terms that such persons deserve the same \"harshness that we show toward the enemy, regardless of how stupid and innocuous we find them. This a war for our very survival. He who does not want our victory wants our defeat. He who wants our defeat wants our death.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1955961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1955961", "title": "Smells Like Nirvana", "text": "Smells Like Nirvana\n\n\"Smells Like Nirvana\" is a parody of Nirvana's song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", written and performed by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic; it was released both as a single and as part of Yankovic's \"Off the Deep End\" album in April 1992. \"Smells Like Nirvana\" was written during a three-year career low for Yankovic after the financial failure of his film \"UHF\", but captured the quickly-rising popularity of grunge and Nirvana's success. The song was written to poke fun at the fact that many people had a hard time understanding Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain's lyrics in the original song. After being unable to contact Nirvana by conventional means, Yankovic called Cobain while the band was on the set of \"Saturday Night Live\", where Cobain quickly gave permission to record the parody.\n\nRecording the song was a change for Yankovic and his band. Usually, the group were forced to record several overdubs. \"Smells Like Nirvana\", however, was relatively straightforward in its musical composition. To promote the single, Yankovic created an associated video for the song that parodied the \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" video. The parody video closely mirrored the original; Yankovic even went so far as to hire several of the same actors and use the same set.\n\n\"Smells Like Nirvana\" was met with critical praise and helped to re-energize Yankovic's career. Cobain considered the parody as a sign that they had \"made it\" as a band. The song is one of Yankovic's most successful singles and was his second top 40 hit in the United States, reaching number 35 on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks. The song's video was nominated for a 1992 MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video.\n\nPrior to writing \"Smells Like Nirvana\", Yankovic's music career had suffered from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, \"UHF\" and the associated soundtrack. Yankovic called that \"the beginning of three years where it was kind of hard for me to recover\". He started work on a new studio album around 1990. To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a Michael Jackson song, which had proven successful twice before with \"Eat It\" and \"Fat\". He had composed a parody of Jackson's \"Black or White\", titled \"Snack All Night\", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended to be a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that \"Snack All Night\" was not one of his better works. While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.\n\nThe band Nirvana started to become a name in the music scene at the time, creating \"big, seismic shifts in pop culture\" according to Yankovic. Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 album \"Nevermind\", which featured \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", was \"really great\", but feared that at its release the band was not popular enough to warrant a parody. By early 1992, \"Nevermind\" had reached platinum certification and led the \"Billboard\" charts, which led Yankovic to start working on a parody. Yankovic noted that much of the publicity around \"Nevermind\" dealt with the inability to comprehend the songs' lyrics, both in their phrasing and the manner in which they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic decided to use this as the basis for his parody. Yankovic noted, \"I try not to go the obvious route all the time, but sometimes the most obvious is actually the best.\" Yankovic had initial difficulty getting permission for the parody, as his manager claimed he was unable to get through to the group numerous times. When Yankovic learned that Nirvana would be performing on the January 11, 1992 show of \"Saturday Night Live\", he called his \"UHF\" co-star, Victoria Jackson, at the time a regular cast member of the show. Jackson managed to give the phone to Cobain so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, though initially he inquired if the song would be about food, a common theme in many of Yankovic's songs. Yankovic explained that the song would be about Cobain's incomprehensible lyrics, to which Cobain replied, according to Yankovic, \"Oh, sure, of course, that's funny.\"\n\nThe song was recorded around January 27, 1992 at Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. It was the final song recorded for the album, as Yankovic generally records the songs that will be released as singles last. Recording took between three and four days. The band worked to match the same fluctuating tempos that were in the original song; Jon Schwartz, Yankovic's drummer, noted that \"the [drum] part was pretty loose. [...] Tempos were up and down. We adjusted the tempos on our song to meet the Nirvana version. It's by no means steady.\" Compared to previous parodies, where upwards of 20-some instruments had to be mixed together, the simpler composition of \"Teen Spirit\" made it much easier for the band to complete the song.\n\nYankovic later noted that recording the song's vocals was particularly difficult, because he was singing \"for eight to 12 hours a day\", which caused strain on his vocal cords. For the verse where Yankovic mumbles the lyrics to the song, he placed several cookies in his mouth to achieve the garbled effect. During the parody's musical interlude, Yankovic gargled water to the tune of the original's guitar solo. The solo also features kazoos and a tuba, with the latter being played by Tommy Johnson.\n\nLyrically, \"Smells Like Nirvana\" pokes fun at the original song's difficult-to-understand words. The opening verse begins \"What is this song/All about?/Can't figure any lyrics out\". At one point, Yankovic purposely garbles the lyrics: \"It's hard to \"bargle nawdle zouss\"/With all these marbles in my mouth\". He admitted in an interview that he woke up \"in the middle of the night\" and wrote down the phrase \"bargle nawdle zouss\", thinking that it would \"be important someday.\"\n\nThe music video, directed by Yankovic's manager Jay Levey, is a near shot-for-shot parody of the original video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", which depicts the band playing at a high school concert while it descends into riot. Yankovic is present on guitar and vocals as Kurt Cobain, with Steve Jay on bass as Krist Novoselic, and Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz on drums as Dave Grohl. All three wear clothing and long-haired wigs to imitate the look of Nirvana in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Yankovic's video uses many of the same props, actors and camera angles; in particular, the video was shot in the same Culver City, California sound stage as Nirvana's video, several of the cheerleaders and audience members were from the original video, and Tony De La Rosa reprises his role as the janitor. Levey stated that they were able to recreate much of the same setting with help of the producers of the original Nirvana video once they were aware that the song had Cobain's blessing. Yankovic had a brief conversation with Samuel Bayer, the original director of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in preparation for the video shoot. Although Yankovic noted that \"he was certainly going along with it\", he felt that Bayer was \"the least enthused\" because \"he was a true artíste\" and was reluctant to see his work parodied.\n\nThe video includes actor Dick Van Patten in a guest role. Van Patten, being one of the few celebrities that could be reached through immediate contacts, was a last-minute addition by Yankovic. According to Yankovic, Van Patten became \"kind of [their] good luck charm\", and he would appear in a few of Yankovic's future videos. Professional skateboarder Tony Hawk also appears as one of the many extras as a result of the Birdhouse Skateboards team providing \"skater/punks\" for the video, although Yankovic was not aware of this until a 2009 Twitter post by Hawk. Schwartz attempted to recreate Grohl's wild headbanging during filming, leaving him with a stiff neck several days afterward.\n\nThe single for \"Smells Like Nirvana\" was released on April 2, 1992, while the album containing it, \"Off the Deep End\", saw its release on April 14, 1992. The single charted on several \"Billboard\" charts, making it Yankovic's most successful single since his single \"Eat It\", which charted in 1984. The song debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on April 25, 1992. It peaked at number 35 and remained on the chart for two weeks. The single also charted on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, also peaking at number 35 and remaining for two weeks. The single was also popular in the other countries. In Canada, the single charted at number 48. In the United Kingdom, the single entered the charts on April 7, 1992, and peaked at number 58, spending only one week on the charts. In Australia, \"Smells Like Nirvana\" was released on June 14, 1992, and spent six weeks on the charts. It peaked at number 24.\n\nAfter its release, \"Smells Like Nirvana\" was considered, at the time, the largest comeback in Yankovic's career. The song was well-received by the media. AllMusic reviewer Barry Weber wrote that the song illustrated \"the kind of brilliant writing Yankovic was still capable of doing\". Anthony Violanti, a reporter for \"The Buffalo News\", called the song \"the high point\" of one of Yankovic's concerts. Nirvana famously enjoyed the parody. Cobain is claimed to have considered that Nirvana had \"made it\" with the success of Yankovic's parody. In his personal journals that were later published, he calls Yankovic \"America's modern pop-rock genious \". Grohl is also reported to have realized his band was truly successful when Yankovic asked for permission to record the parody. According to an executive for Nirvana's label, DGC Records, \"Smells Like Nirvana\" was responsible for selling an additional million copies of Nirvana's album \"Nevermind\". The video was nominated for the 1992 MTV Video Awards for \"Best Male Video\", although it did not win. At the awards ceremony, Nirvana was initially asked to perform, but they declined. The offer was then extended to Yankovic, before Nirvana relented. Yankovic later joked that \"I might've been a bargaining chip\".\n\nAfter Cobain died by suicide in 1994, Yankovic and his band were hesitant to play the extremely popular \"Smells Like Nirvana\" during live shows. For several months after Cobain's death, Yankovic would first perform a somber tribute to Cobain prior to playing the song itself. Shortly after Cobain's death, Yankovic was scheduled to play a show in Seattle, where Nirvana first became famous. Due to this connection, Yankovic was hesitant to perform the spoof, as he worried about how the audience might react to the parody. However, Yankovic was urged by journalists to go through with the performance, as they said that the song would be \"cathartic\" for the area. Ultimately, the performance \"went over extremely well\". Yankovic continues to play \"Smells Like Nirvana\" live, stating that \"Kurt was a fan of the song\" and \"he would have wanted it that way.\"\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\" episode \"That '90s Show\", set primarily in flashback to the 1990s, Homer Simpson is shown creating one of the first grunge bands while trying to cope with Marge's infidelity; the band, called \"Sadgasm\", becomes highly popular. At one point, Homer writes a new song called \"Shave Me\"—itself a loose parody of Nirvana's real single \"Rape Me\". Homer's song is then parodied as \"Brainfreeze\" in both song and video by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who voices himself. Homer takes Yankovic's parody as a sign that his band has become successful, but his depressed state after breaking up with Marge leaves him unable to enjoy the song's humor; he gloomily bemoans, \"He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life\". The sequence of events was written to parallel much of the history of \"Smells Like Nirvana\", including Kurt Cobain's reaction to the parody.\n\nDuring live performances, Yankovic dons clothing similar to what Cobain wore in the video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". This includes an electric left-handed guitar, a shirt similar to Cobain's, and a blonde wig. The costuming for the performance is critical; Schwartz explained that \"if anything's missing, Al won't do it\". The rest of Al's band also participates. Steve Jay, who plays bass, uses two bass straps to emulate and exaggerate \"Novoselic's low-hanging bass\". He explained that he positions his instrument \"to where I can just barely touch the strings\". The members of the band also mock-mosh. Jim West, the band's guitarist, noted that moshing is usually tame, but that there \"were a few collisions where people got hurt, but not the audience, just the band.\" Sometimes during the third verse, after Yankovic sings \"And I forgot the next verse,\" he drops out for the next few lines, pretending to actually forget the lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently the head coach of the Mesquite Outlaws in the Major Arena Soccer League. His nickname means \"armadillo\" in Portuguese.\n\nIn 1981, Tatu came to the United States after playing with São Paulo. He had intended to play for several months, earning enough money to buy a house in São Paulo. Tatu signed with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the NASL during the 1981–82 indoor season and scored a hat trick in his first appearance even though he had not yet had the opportunity to practice with his new club. He quickly became a fan favorite while playing several more outdoor and indoor seasons in Tampa Bay. He was a member of the Rowdies when they won the 1983 NASL Grand Prix of Indoor Soccer.\n\nThe NASL folded in 1984, and Tatu moved to the Dallas Sidekicks of Major Indoor Soccer League. When Tatu moved to Dallas, the Cleveland Force sued the Sidekicks, arguing they had an agreement with him to purchase his contract from the Rowdies. The Sidekicks eventually gave the Force their second round 1985 draft choice. As a Dallas Sidekick, Tatu was a part of all four Sidekick's championship teams (1987, 1993, 1998 and 2001). From 1984 until 1992, the Sidekicks played in MISL. The league collapsed in 1992, and Dallas moved to the newly created Continental Indoor Soccer League until that league also collapsed in 1997. The CISL played during the summer, and Tatu spent the 1993–94 winter indoor season with the Wichita Wings of the National Professional Soccer League.\n\nIn 1998, the Sidekicks competed in the Premier Soccer Alliance. The PSA became the World Indoor Soccer League in 1999. In 2002, Dallas entered the newly reconstituted Major Indoor Soccer League. Tatu retired from playing in 2003.\n\nIn 1998, Tatu replaced Gordon Jago as the head coach of the Dallas Sidekicks. Tatu is the only person to win the player of the year and the coach of the year in the same season (1998). As a head coach, he went 63–53 in the regular season and 7–3 in the playoffs.\n\nTatu also spent six years coaching at The Highlands School in Irving, Texas, where he coached the Blazers to three state championships in 1997, 1998 and 2000. The high school team which he coaches now is Prince of Peace Christian School in Carrollton, Texas. He led the Prince of Peace varsity boys to seven TAPPS state championships: 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 (all fall championships) and 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011–2012 (all winter championships). In the 2017–18 season, Tatu led his team to the TAPPS State Final Four where the Eagles lost during a torrential downpour against Brighter Horizons Academy. Tatu currently has also been coaching several girls' soccer teams for the Sting Soccer Club in North Texas.\n\nIn April 2012, it was announced that the Dallas Sidekicks would return to the indoor game as part of the Professional Arena Soccer League for the 2012–13 season. Tatu was a co-owner of the team and served as both the team's general manager and head coach for the inaugural season. He would remain with the club for three seasons, leaving in 2015.\n\nTatu, in 2010 (Sting 95) blew through all competition from East to West Coast in many travel tournaments testing best-of-the-best from every part of the known soccer world. Sting 95' Royal , who were renamed to Sting '95 were a team who knew few defeats and crushed the competition winning a cornucopia of 1st Place Medals. In 2010, Sting '95 was challenged with 2 National Championships to contend with (within 1 week). ECNL was brand new at that time and NYSL (National Youth Soccer League) was phasing out but still active. Overland Park, KS was the venue for the Final in the NYSL final. Sting won 1–0 under amazing skies and after a short victory dance, packed up quickly for the ECNL. 1st-time finals in Seattle the next week. They almost lost in the final match vs. a very tough team from California, but persevered to win at the end, earning 2 National Titles in one week. This feat has never been matched and never will. Incidentally, Sting '95 won ECNL National title the next year 2011.\n\nOn 22 July 2019, Tatu was named the first-ever head coach for the Major Arena Soccer League's Mesquite Outlaws.\n\nTatu was known for throwing his jersey into the crowd after scoring a goal, a tradition that started during his time with the Tampa Bay Rowdies. He is a well-respected sports figure in Dallas because he is considered to be one of the best players to have played the indoor game in the U.S. His community involvement includes running many soccer camps in the Dallas area. When the Olympic Torch came through Dallas for the 2002 Salt Lake City games, Tatu had the honor as serving as a torch bearer.\n\nTatu has many indoor soccer records. He is second all-time in goal scoring with 857. He has the second most seasons played (21). Only Victor Nogueira has played more with 23 seasons. He is seventh on the all-time list with games played (633). He is also second in points (1585), second in shots (4396) and second in game-winning goals (77). He is the leader in power play goals with 113. Tatu is one of 3 players to have won all 4 championships with the Dallas Sidekicks.\n\nIn October 2011, Tatu was a member of the inaugural class of inductees into the Indoor Soccer Hall of Fame. At halftime of the February 9, 2013, game against the Rockford Rampage, the current Dallas Sidekicks retired Tatu's #9 jersey, honoring his long tenure as both a player and a coach for the original Dallas Sidekicks.\n\n"}

The law bars federal, state and local governments from taxing Internet access and from imposing discriminatory Internet-only taxes such as bit taxes, bandwidth taxes, and email taxes. It also bars multiple taxes on electronic commerce.\n\nOne of the principal sponsors of the Act argues that the law also codifies the U.S. Supreme Court's Quill Corp. v. North Dakota decision and stipulates that no state shall collect a sales tax from retail purchases made over the internet or through a mail-order catalog unless the seller has a physical presence in the state attempting to collect such tax. If a seller does have a physical presence in a state, then that seller may be required to collect the same state and local sales taxes as those collected on non-Internet sales. The Act did not repeal any state sales or use tax. The U.S. Supreme Court's Quill Corp. v. North dakota was overturned in June of 2018 by South Dakota v. Wayfair.\n\nThe 1998 law also authorized the establishment of a study commission to study national tax policy with regard to the Internet. The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce studied the issue from 1999 to 2000. The Commission was chaired by then-Virginia Governor James S. Gilmore, III, who led a majority coalition on the Commission to issue a final report opposing taxation of the Internet and eliminating the federal excise tax on telecommunications services, among other ideas.\n\nThe law was originally enacted as a ten-year moratorium. It was then extended multiple times by the United States Congress, including several short-term extensions in 2014 and 2015: President Barack Obama signed one extension on September 19, 2014, until December 11, 2014; another one on December 16, 2014, in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, until October 1, 2015; and yet another extension on September 30, 2015, in the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2016, which extended the Internet Tax Freedom Act through December 11, 2015. \n\nMeanwhile, on July 15, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (H.R. 3086; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internet Tax Freedom Act to make permanent the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.\n\nOn June 9, 2015, the United States House of Representatives voted and approved by voice vote H.R. 235, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (PITFA), which makes permanent the ban on federal, state, and local taxation of email and Internet access originally enacted in the Internet Tax Freedom Act. It had 188 cosponsors, with the majority of Republicans supporting the measure. The bill was then included in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 and passed the House 256-158 on December 11, 2015. The Senate passed the bill on February 11, 2016. \n\nThe Internet Tax Freedom Act became permanent law when President Obama signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 () on February 24, 2016.\n\n\n"}

Namaland comprised an area of and was to accommodate the estimated 34,806 southern Namas of the South West African territory. A centrally administered local government was created in 1980.\n\nThe term Namaland also covers a much broader region of southern Namibia which is the traditional home of the northern Nama or Namaqua people. Their language, Nama, is the only surviving dialect of the Khoekhoe language. The suffix -qua means “people” and can be added to the names of most Khoekhoe groups. The region of the Northern Cape south of the Orange River is called Namaqualand.\n\nIn the 1960s the South Africa, which was administering South West Africa under a League of Nations mandate, came under increased international pressure regarding its minority White rule over the majority of Blacks. The solution envisaged by South Africa—the Odendaal Plan—was to separate the white and the non-white population, grant self-government to the isolated black territories, and thus make Whites the majority population in the vast remainder of the country. Moreover it was envisaged that by separating each ethnic group and confining people by law to their restricted areas, discrimination by race would automatically disappear.\n\nThe demarcated territories were called the \"bantustans\", and the remainder of the land was called the \"Police Zone\". Forthwith, all non-white people employed in the Police Zone became \"migrant workers\", and pass laws were established to police movement in and out of the bantustans.\n\nThe combined territory of all bantustans was roughly equal in size to the Police Zone. However, all bantustans were predominantly rural and excluded major towns. All harbours, most of the railway network and the tarred road infrastructure, all larger airports, the profitable diamond areas and the national parks were situated in the Police Zone.\n\nFor Southern Namibia the Odendaal Plan designated Namaland from four already existing native reserves, Berseba, Tses, the \"Krantzplatz\" reserve near Gibeon and the \"Soromas\" reserve near Bethanie, plus 165 white-owned farms. Generous offers from the administration to buy these farms from the White settlers lead to many voluntary sales but also raised farm prices in the Police Zone. The townlands of Gibeon were added, and formed the administrative capital of the bantustan. This territory excluded the former \"Bondels\" Nama reserve, comprising around Warmbad. Its Nama inhabitants were to relocate to the new reserve.\n\nAltogether, Namaland had a size of . 34,806 Nama were estimated to live in the south of South West Africa in the 1960s; all of them were supposed to relocate to the new territory.\n\nNamaland, like other homelands in South West Africa, was abolished in May 1989 at the start of the transition to independence.\n\n"}

{"id": "1956004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956004", "title": "Pachypodium ambongense", "text": "Pachypodium ambongense\n\nPachypodium ambongense is a species of plant in the family Apocynaceae. It was first published as a species of the genus \"Pachypodium\" in 1924 by the botanist Henri Louis Poisson.\n\nHaving a habit as a shrub that is 1 m (3.28 feet) to 2 m (6.56 feet) and bottle-shaped, \"Pachypodium ambongense\" inhabits the western low, open deciduous forest of Madagascar on a substrate of Mesozoic calcareous rock. It is fairly rare to the landscape, perhaps, suggesting a more specialized environment needed for it to grow. It is known by common name in Madagascar as \"Songosongo\" or \"Betono.\"\n\nAs a shrub 1 m (3.28 feet) to 2m (6.56 feet) high with a subglobose, not entirely spherical, laterally compressed, flattened on a side habit; it has a diameter ranging from 10 cm ( 3.94 inches) to 40 cm (15.75 inches). Overall it resembles a bottle-shape in habit.\n\nThe bark is grey-green and smooth or it has leaf scars. Overall \"Pachypodium ambongense\" has a bottle-shaped profile. Its short branches form right below the terminal inflorescence and measure from 7 cm (2.76 inches) to 18 cm (7.09 inches) in diameter. \"P. ambongense's\" branchlets are 18 mm (0.71 inch) to 40 mm (1.58 inches) by 5 mm (0.20 inches) to 6 mm (.24 inches). They are covered with paired straight spines, 2 cm (0.79 inch) to 10 cm (3.94 inch) long by 0.5 cm (1.97 inches) to 3 cm (1.18 inches) wide at the base. When young they are sparsely pubescent, or hairy.\n\nThe leaves are confined near the apices, the apex or the highest point, of the branchlets. They are petiolate, meaning that they have a leave stalk. The petiole, or stalk roughly, is 2 mm (0.08 inch) to 10 mm (0.39 inch) long. While being sparsely pubescent and hairy, the blade(s) are dark green with a midrib that is pale green above and pale green to pale grey beneath when fresh. When dry, the leave is papery. They are shaped as being (I) ovate--\"broad and rounded at the base and tapering toward the end\"—to (II) obovate--\"egg-shaped and flat, like ovate, but with a narrower end\"—measuring 1.9 to 3.4 times as long as they are wide. Therefore, the leaves often range in size from 3.5 cm (1.38 inch) to 9 cm (0.35 inch) in length by 1.5 cm (0.59 inch) to 3 cm (1.18 inch) in width. They are obtuse--\"having a blunt or rounded tip\"—to rounded in shape at the apex. Cuneate--\"wedge-shaped, narrowly triangular at the base\"—or decurrent--\"having the leaf base that extends down the stem below its point of insertion\"—into the petiole, the leaves have a margin that is revolute, the margins rolled backwards, and glabrous, smooth above with impressed reticulate venation. They are densely pubescent, hairy, underneath with a midrib and secondary veins prominently showing. There are 23 to 32 secondary veins in pairs, which are straight at the base, up curved at the apex, and forming an angle of 45-85° with the Costa, the rib, ridge in a midrib of a leaf. The tertiary venation is reticulate, either \"making\" a net or network of veins or \"marking\" with lines resembling a network. They are hidden by the indumentum, any covering of hairs etc., beneath the leaf.\n\nThe inflorescence is sessile, with a petiolate or stalk, or shortly pedunculate, a short main axis of the entire inflorescence. Its flower is congested with dimensions that read 6 cm (0.24 inch) to 8 cm (0.32 inch) by 3 cm (1.18 inch) to 5 cm (1.97 inch). The inflorescence has 1 to 8 flowers. The peduncle, again the main axis of the inflorescence, is dark green and is 0 mm (0 inch) to 5 mm (0.20 inch) in length by 2 mm (0.08 inch) by 4 mm (0.16 inch) in width. The inflorescence is sparsely pubescent to glabrous. The pedicels, the stalks of single flowers, are green, 4 mm (0.16 inch) to 10 mm (0.39 inch) long, and sparsely pubescent to glabrous. Bracts, for the inflorescence, are ovate, flattened egg-shaped, 2 mm (0.8 inch) by 1 mm (0.04 inch), and acuminate, tapering gradually to a sharp point, at the apex. The bracts are pubescent outside and glabrous inside.\n\nThe flowers of \"Pachypodium ambongense\" have sepals that are pale green. (Usually all sepals are some shade of green.) The sepals are connate at the base, uniting the sepals into one morphological structure, for about 0.2 mm (0.007 inch). They are persistent, lasting past maturity without falling off, and ovate--\"flattened egg shaped profile\"—or narrowly ovate. They measure 1.5 mm (.059 inch) to 2 mm (0.079 inch) long insomuch as they are wide at 3 mm (0.118 inch) to 4 mm (0.159 inch) by 2 mm (0.079 inch) to 2.2 mm (0.087 inch). The sepals are acuminate, ending in a point at the apex, and can have stiff hairs at the apex. The sepals are typically sparsely pubescent, hairy, or glabrous, smooth, outside, and almost always glabrous inside.\n\nThe corolla of \"Pachypodium ambongense\" is limb white with the tube being pale greenish-yellow outside and with a throat that is yellowish-green inside. It measures 4.3 cm (0.17 inch) to 6 cm (0.24 inch) long in the mature bud and forms a comparatively wide broadly ovoid, shaped like an egg--\"ovate-like without being flat\"—head, which is 3.8 cm (1.5 inch) to 4.0 cm (0.16 inch) of the bud length. The head of the corolla appears to be 17 mm (0.67 inch) by 23 mm (0.91 inch) in length by 4 mm (0.16 inch) to 10 mm (0.39 inch) in width. It is obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip, at the apex. As well, the head of the corolla is glabrous, smooth outside, with a sparsely pubescent, hairy belt inside that is 7 mm (0.28 inch) wide and located just below the insertion point of the stamens. Otherwise, the corolla head is glabrous with a tube that is 10.5 to 12.3 times as long as the calyx, the outermost series of leaves, collectively called the sepals. Moreover the calyx is 1.4 to 1.8 times as long as the lobes, measuring at 3.7 cm (1.46 inch) to 4.2 cm (1.65 inches) long. The basal part of the corolla tube is narrowly cylindrical and is half of the length of the entire tube at 19 mm (0.75 inch) to 21 mm (0.83 inch) in length by 1.5 mm (0.059 inch) to 2 mm (0.079 inch) wide. The upper segment of the basal part is urceolate, or urn-shaped, and clearly narrowed at the throat, measuring 18 mm (.71 inch) to 21 mm (0.83 inch) long by 3mm (0.12 inch) by 4 mm (0.16 inch) wide at the mouth. The corolla lobes are obliquely ovate, a flatten egg-shape profile—running at 0.52 to 0.7 times as long as the corolla tube, which is 1.6 to 2 times as long it is wide. It measures 21 mm (.83 inch) to 30 mm (1.18 inch) by 11 mm (0.43 inch) to 15 mm (0.59 inch). The corolla lobes are obtuse at the apex of the tube.\n\nThe stamens, the male reproductive \"organ\" of a flower, have an apex that is 6 mm (0.24 inch) below the mouth of the corolla tube. They are inserted--\"below the sepals and petals of a flower\"—at 0.62 of the length of the corolla tube with a total length of 2.5 cm (0.98 inch) from the base. The anthers are very narrowly triangular at 5.25 to 5.75 times as long they are wide at 10.5 mm (0.41 inch) to 11.5 (0.45 inch) mm by 2 mm (0.078 inch). They are sparsely pubescent, hairy inside at the base of the connective, just below where they are located at the base of the pistil head. The fertile part of the pistil is 5 mm (0.20 inch) long. The stamens have an apex of 6 mm (0.24 inch) below the mouth of the corolla tube, inserted at 0.62 of the length of the corolla tube. That places it 2.5 cm (0.98 inch) from the base. Again the anthers are very narrowly triangular, 5.25-5.75 times as they are long as they are wide at 10.5 to 11.5 time 2 mm (0.078 inch). The anthers are sparsely pubescent inside at the base of the connective and just below where they occur with the base of the pistil head.\n\nThe pistil, the female organ of reproduction in a flower, on \"Pachypodium ambongense\" is 2.7 cm (01.06 inch) long. The ovary is 2 times 1.3 mm (0.51 inch) times 1.2 mm (0.47 inch). It is glabrous, and its disk is urceolate, urn-shape, 2.5 mm (0.98 inch) high. The pistil abruptly narrows at the throat. It is 5-lobed at the apex and entirely covers the ovary. The glabrous, smooth style--\"the usually slender part of a pistil, situated between the ovary and the stigma\"—is 22.7 mm (0.89 inch) long where it widens at the apex. The pistil head is 2.3 mm (.091 inch) high composed of an obconical--\"conical, but having the apex downward; inversely conical\"—basal part 1.3 times 0.6 mm (0.024 inch). The basal part has a ring-shaped central part 0.5 times 1.3 mm (0.051 inch) and a stigmoid--\"resembling the letter \"\"S\"\" or the lower-case Greek letter sigma \"(ς)\"--\"apex half the 0.9 mm (0.0395 inch). The ovules are approximately 50 in count in each carpel--\"one of the structural units of a pistil, representing a modified, ovule-bearing leaf\".\n\n\"Rapanarivo et al.\" base this data on Lavranos' earlier work\n\nThe fruit of \"Pachypodium ambongense\" consists of two mericaps, a carpel with one seed or one of a pair split apart at maturity. The mericaps are dark brown outside and whitish inside when dried. They are fusiform, tapering at each end and spindle-shaped. They measure approximately 15 cm (5.91 inch) in length and 1 cm (3.94 inch) in width. The encasement wall of the seeds is thin at 0.5 mm ( .0.020 inch) thick.\n\nEndemic to Madagascar. The Namoroka Nat. 8. Rare in the landscape.\n\n\"Pachypodium ambongense\" grows on strongly eroded, Mesozoic calcareous rocks where the fissures are filled with humus. in the low open deciduous forest of the Western Forest zone, tolerating full sun to part sun. This habitat is consistency with the general tendency of \"Pachypodium\" to inhabit the western side of the island. Growing on a calcareous substrate suggests that this plant prefers only basic soil conditions, as \"Rapanarivo et al.\" did not find \"P. ambongense\" growing on other substrates as some species of Pachypodium do. Also its preference for low open forest mean that it can be found growing at an altitude of 100 m (328 feet) or less.\n\nThe plants that are often associated with its habitat are: \"Adenia firingalavensis\" Harms (Passifloraceae); \"Aloe\" sp. (Asphodelaceae); \"Cissus\" sp. (Vitaceae); \"Euphorbia viguieri\" (Euphorbiaceae); \"Lomatophyllum\" sp. (Liliaceae); \"Pachypodium rutenbergianum\" (Apocynaceae); \"Pandanus\" sp. (Pandanaceae); \"Uncarina sakalava\" \"Uncarina perrieri\" (Pedaliaceae); and \"Xerosicyos perrieri\" (Cucurbitaceae). Associated plants are key to understanding the ecology of a taxon because they often act as site indicators as to what the habitat consists of in the landscape and within the climate.\n\nThe[substrate should be loose peat with lime gravel. Temperatures from Spring to Autumn, as varied by night and day, should be between 18 °C (64.4 °F) and 38 °C (100.4 °F). To keep it in the winter temperatures should be between nocturnal 15 °C (59 °F) and diurnal 20 °C (68 °F). While in the dry season, moisten the soil only when the soil dries out completely, then only water slightly; so that the soil does not dry out completely. After the dry season, it needs a lot of water. It flowers after the Dry Season. When the Dry Season begins it does not say by \"Röösli\" or \"Rapanarivo et al.'s\" account of the habitat. Presumably, Winter would be the dry season unless otherwise noted, as is the case for \"Pachypodium namaquanum\". In fact, Rowley states that all \"Pachypodium\" can be kept growing year round so long the temperature is like normal growing temperatures, which can be achieved under lights and in a Greenhouse. Growing year-round would likely interfere with the taxon's bloom cycle, it stand to reason.\n\n\nThe type specimen for \"Pachypodium ambongense\" is: Madagascar, Majunga (Mahajanga), Namoroka Res., \"Perrier de la Bâthie\" 1515 (holotype P).

{"id": "1956008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956008", "title": "Victoria Memorial, London", "text": "Victoria Memorial, London\n\nThe Victoria Memorial is a monument to Queen Victoria, located at the end of The Mall in London, and designed and executed by the sculptor (Sir) Thomas Brock. Designed in 1901, it was unveiled on 16 May 1911, though it was not completed until 1924. It was the centrepiece of an ambitious urban planning scheme, which included the creation of the Queen’s Gardens to a design by Sir Aston Webb, and the refacing of Buckingham Palace (which stands behind the memorial) by the same architect.\n\nLike the earlier Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens, commemorating Victoria's consort, the Victoria Memorial has an elaborate scheme of iconographic sculpture. The central pylon of the memorial is of Pentelic marble, and individual statues are in Lasa marble and gilt bronze. The memorial weighs 2,300 tonnes and is 104 ft wide. In 1970 it was listed at Grade I.\n\nKing Edward VII suggested that a joint Parliamentary committee should be formed to develop plans for a Memorial to Queen Victoria following her death. The first meeting took place on 19 February 1901 at the Foreign Office, Whitehall. The first secretary of the committee was Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham. Initially these meetings were behind closed doors, and the proceedings were not revealed to the public. However the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Joseph Dimsdale, publicly announced that the committee had decided that the Memorial should be \"monumental\". \n\nReginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, the secretary of the committee, submitted the proposal to the King on 4 March 1901. A number of sites were suggested, and the King visited both Westminster Abbey and the park near the Palace of Westminster. Several ideas were rumoured at this time, including an open square in The Mall near to the Duke of York Column, and a memorial located in Green Park.\n\nOn 26 March the decision was announced to locate the Memorial outside Buckingham Palace and slightly shorten The Mall. It was estimated that the work would cost £250,000 and decided that there would be no grant given by the Government to the construction. Once the site was selected, a competition was conducted for the design. Five architects were chosen to develop designs. This phase lasted until the beginning of July 1901, when the committee selected its primary choice for the construction and took it to the King for approval. It was announced on 21 October 1902 that Thomas Brock had been chosen as the designer. The expectation was that the memorial would cost £200,000.\n\nFunding for the memorial was gathered from around the British Empire as well as the public. The Australian House of Representatives granted a £25,000 contribution for the construction on 17 October 1905. The New Zealand government submitted a cheque for £15,000 towards the fund. By October 1901 some £154,000 had been gathered for the construction of the Memorial. During 1902 a number of tribes from the west coast of Africa sent goods to be sold, with the proceeds going towards the fund. Alfred Lewis Jones had arranged for these items to be brought from Africa to Liverpool free of charge on his ships.\n\nFollowing the public and national donations towards the funds, there was more money collected than was necessary for the construction of the Victoria Memorial. Funds were therefore diverted towards the construction of Admiralty Arch at the other end of The Mall, and a redevelopment to clear a path directly from that road into Trafalgar Square. Sir Aston Webb was put in charge of this project; he built the Arch so economically that enough money was left over to re-front the entirety of Buckingham Palace, a job that was completed in 13 weeks due to the pre-fabrication of the new stonework.\n\nThe initial preparatory stage was to re-route the road and modify The Mall. Brock hoped that work on constructing the Memorial itself could be started at some point in 1905. The lower half of the Memorial was revealed to the public on 24 May 1909. Thousands of people visited it on the first day.\n\nFollowing a practice ceremony on 11 March, in the presence of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the dedication ceremony took place on 16 May 1911, presided over by King George V. His first cousin, Wilhelm II of Germany, was also present. These two were the senior grandsons of Victoria, and arrived, together with their families, in royal procession. Also in attendance were a large number of Members of Parliament, and representatives of various armed forces.\n\nIn his role as Home Secretary, Winston Churchill carried the text of the speeches. Lord Esher addressed the King and the gathered crowd, explaining the history of the Memorial. The King replied to this, referring to his involvement in the development of the monument to his grandmother. He talked of the impact of Queen Victoria and of her popularity with the public. In total, the ceremony went on for thirty minutes. Following this, it was revealed to the press that the King had decided that the sculptor of the Memorial, Thomas Brock, was to be knighted.\n\nAs part of the celebrations of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the Victoria Memorial (along with areas in Green Park and Buckingham Palace) was used as a platform for a fireworks display which lasted fourteen minutes with a total of two and three-quarter tonnes of fireworks used. In addition, water jets were added to the fountains in the Victoria Memorial, which fired water up into the air. This display followed a concert held in the Palace forecourt.\n\nIt was announced in February 2012 that the Victoria Memorial would form the centrepiece of the stage for Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Concert on 4 June that year. Platforms designed by Mark Fisher were built around the memorial at a cost of £200,000, and were constructed in two weeks. A number of performers appeared from across the sixty years of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, including Gary Barlow, Tom Jones, Elton John, Jessie J, Madness, Dame Shirley Bassey and Paul McCartney. Tickets were free and allocated by public ballot; and in addition to being seen live by the 10,000 fans in attendance, the event was broadcast by the BBC and highlights were shown in the United States on ABC. \n\nLater in 2012, the Memorial marked the end of \"Our Greatest Team Parade\" on 10 September 2012. This parade celebrated the successes of the British teams at the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. There were 21 floats holding a total of around 800 athletes, and it was estimated that around a million members of the public cheered them on. The area from Admiralty Arch to the Victoria Memorial down the Mall was reserved for ticket holders. After the arrival at the Victoria Memorial, there was a flypast by helicopters of the Royal Air Force, as well as a British Airways jet and a flight of the Red Arrows. During the games, the Mall and the Victoria Memorial had been used as the finishing point for the Marathon, as well as being on the triathlon route.\n\nThe Memorial was damaged by anti-austerity protesters during the \"Million Mask March\" on 5 November 2013, which took place in central London focused on Trafalgar Square and outside Buckingham Palace. During the following year's protests, the Memorial was guarded by police officers.\n\nAt the top of the central pylon stands a gilded bronze \"Winged Victory\", standing on a globe and with a victor's palm in one hand. Beneath her are personifications of \"Constancy\", holding a compass with its needle pointing true north, and \"Courage\", holding a club. Beneath these, on the eastern and western sides, are two eagles with wings outspread, representing Empire. Below these, statues of an enthroned Queen Victoria (facing The Mall) and of \"Motherhood\" (facing Buckingham Palace), with \"Justice\" (facing north-west towards Green Park) and \"Truth\" (facing south-east). These were created from solid blocks of marble, with \"Truth\" being sculpted from a block weighing 40 tonnes.\n\nBrock described the symbolism of the Memorial, saying that it was devoted to the \"qualities which made our Queen so great and so much beloved.\" He added that the statue of the Queen was placed to face towards the city, while flanked by \"Truth\" and \"Justice\" as he felt that \"she was just and that she sought the truth always and in circumstances\", while the \"Motherhood\" was to represent her \"great love for her people\".\n\nAt the four corners of the monument are massive bronze figures with lions, representing \"Peace\" (a female figure holding an olive branch), \"Progress\" (a nude youth holding a flaming torch), \"Agriculture\" (a woman in peasant dress with a sickle and a sheaf of corn) and \"Manufacture\" (a blacksmith in modern costume with a hammer and a scroll). The self-bases of the last two groups are inscribed . \n\nThe whole sculptural programme has a nautical theme, much like the rest of The Mall (Admiralty Arch, for example). This can be seen in the mermaids, mermen and the hippogriff, all of which are suggestive of the United Kingdom's naval power.\n\nThe memorial is placed in the middle of an architectural setting of formal gardens and gates designed by the architect Sir Aston Webb.\n\nAt nearly tall, the Victoria Memorial remains the tallest monument to a King or Queen in England.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1956036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956036", "title": "GetBackers", "text": "GetBackers\n\nThe manga was adapted into an anime television series in 2002. The Studio Deen production aired on the Tokyo Broadcasting System from October 5, 2002 until September 20, 2003, for a complete run of 49 episodes. It was also dubbed in English and broadcast by the anime television network Animax across its respective networks worldwide. The series was licensed for an English-language release in North America by Tokyopop, which released 27 volumes between February 10, 2004 and December 2, 2008. It has since lost the license to the property, and all existing releases are now out-of-print.\n\nThe series tells the story of Ginji Amano and Ban Mido, a pair of super powered individuals known as the \"GetBackers\". The duo operates a freelance repossession service out of one of the seedier areas of Shinjuku, Tokyo. For a fee, they will recover any lost or stolen item for a client with \"an almost 100% success rate\". The GetBackers' job often leads them into bizarre and dangerous situations in order to \"get back what shouldn't be gone\". Their targets range from lost video games to misplaced components of an atomic bomb. The plot mostly revolves around their adventures, often complicated by the pair's convoluted, individual pasts and a mysterious place known as the Infinity Fortress (Limitless Fortress in the anime dub).\n\nA conglomeration of disused, condemned buildings clustered together to form a self-contained habitat, Limitless Fortress is subdivided into three specific tiers – Lower Town, the Beltline and Babylon City. Lower Town is the lowest in altitude, with several layers extending below ground level. The Beltline, the most dangerous area of The Limitless Fortress, is ruled by Der Kaiser, Ban's father. Babylon City, the upper most level of the Limitless Fortress, is said to be where the Brain Trust resides, and is the home of Ginji's mother. In actuality, Babylon City is what one might consider the real world, with everything else being a virtual reality creation. Only those who have won the Ogre Battle may enter Babylon City and when that happens, they can change the world as they see fit. Both Ban and Ginji go to the Fortress with Ban wishing to rescue a kidnapped Himiko from Kagami, and Ginji finding a possibility to meet his mother. Going to the Beltline, the GetBackers encounter various warriors taking orders from a being known as Voodoo King from Babylon City. The Voodoo King seeks to obtain three \"keys\" which will help him unlock the gates from Babylon City sealed by Ban's grandmother several years ago. After finding the three keys: Shido's chimera spirit, Himiko's mirror and the GetBackers, the Voodoo King is faced by Ginji, Thunder Emperor alter-ego attacks him in a clash which destroys the Voodoo King and making Raitei disappear forever as he existed to balance the scales. With Voodoo King gone, Raitei's purpose was fulfilled and he disappeared forever. Following this, both Ban and Ginji face each other in Ogre Battle with Ban giving up, impressed with Ginji's will. Ginji goes to Babylon City where he meets his mother from a parallel universe, who explains how she created the Fortress and its surrounding world. Following a discussion between the two of them, the Fortress' world remains unchanged except that the virtual people living become real beings. Ban and Ginji continue their retrieval job, ending the series when requested to go on a mission that will lead them to meet Ban's mother.\n\nThe plot of the anime adaptation of \"GetBackers\" follows the manga's closely until the first season's ending. The second season features various stand alone episodes focused in the GetBackers' missions, while also two story arcs, the second ending the anime series with an open ending.\n\nYuya Aoki conceived the idea of \"GetBackers\" two years before it started serialization. By that time he had few notes about it. Aoki remembers giving many troubles to his editor when he started writing it, but was glad he could finish it. The character of Ban Mido was originally meant to appear in another series from Aoki, but his editor liked it and wanted it to be one of the manga's protagonists. Ginji was meant to appear in the series, but his original personality was first meant to belong to Ban.\n\nThe \"GetBackers\" manga series is written by Yuya Aoki and illustrated by Rando Ayamine. The series was serialized in Kodansha's \"Weekly Shōnen Magazine\" from April 7, 1999 in its 17th issue until its 12th issue from March 7, 2007, totaling twelve story arcs with the name of \"Act\" and a short number of side stories labelled as \"Interlude\" and \"Birth\". The manga consists of 39 \"tankōbon\" with the first released on August 17, 1999, and the last one on April 17, 2007, while some of the last were also released in special editions. On February from 2009, Kodansha published a one-shot chapter from the series in their \"Magazine Special\" journal. An artbook of the manga titled \"G/B\" was released on March 15, 2005 by Kodansha. Additionally, a manga guidebook titled \"GetBackers The Last Piece\" was released on April 17, 2007 containing information about the series' plot, characters, and popularity polls.\n\n\"GetBackers\" is licensed for an English language release in North America by Tokyopop, who first announced it in the Anime Expo 2004 in July 2003. Tokyopop divided the manga in two parts: \"GetBackers\" featuring the first twenty-five and \"GetBackers: Infinity Fortress\" the following ones. \"GetBackers\" was published from February 10, 2004, to July 7, 2008. However, only the first two volumes of \"Infinity Fortress\" were released. On August 31, 2009, Tokyopop announced that they would not be completing the series as their licenses with Kodansha expired and Kodansha required that they immediately stop publication of all previously licensed series, including \"GetBackers\". Because of this, the series is now considered to be out-of-print.\n\nThe anime adaptation of the \"GetBackers\" series was produced by Studio Deen and was directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi and Keitaro Motonaga. The series premiered on Tokyo Broadcasting System in Japan on October 5, 2002 and ran for forty-nine episodes until September 20, 2003. The series was released to Region 2 DVD in Japan by TBS in seventeen individual volumes with three episodes per disc. The anime's music was composed by Taku Iwasaki, and two original soundtracks were released by Pioneer Corporation in Japan on January 24, 2003 and July 25, 2003.\n\nThe anime was first licensed in English by ADV Films. ADV released the English dubbed series in a total of ten DVD volumes from August 24, 2004 to November 1, 2005. Compilations volumes from the seasons 1 and 2 were also released on October 10, 2006 and January 2, 2007, while a full compilation of the series was published on January 15, 2008. In April 2009, A.D. Vision started streaming the series online in their The Anime Network website. The series has been re-licensed by Sentai Filmworks, who re-released it on DVD in later 2012. On August 25, 2016 the series began airing on ShortsHD.\n\nThe anime was also licensed by Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) which created its own English Dub in collaboration with Red Angel Media. The show broadcast on the Animax Channel in Asia, and ABS-CBN / Studio 23 in the Philippines.\n\nTwo drama CDs have been released for the story arcs not found in the TV series, namely the news involving the GetBackers searching for disappeared kids involved with a card game named the Divine Design, their search for a red wine named the Marine Red, and the war between Shido Fuyuki's clan, the Maryudo and their rivals, the Kiryudo. The first CD, entitled 'GetBackers \"TARGET G\"', was released February 21, 2003. The second entitled 'GetBackers \"TARGET B\"' was released on March 21, 2003.\n\nA total of five video games based on \"GetBackers\" have been released in Japan, all of them developed and published by Konami. The first was a fighting game \"GetBackers Dakkanoku: Ubawareta Mugenshiro\" for the PlayStation 2 and PC on September 26, 2002. \"GetBackers Dakkanoku - Jagan Fuuin!\" followed it in 2003 for the PC and Game Boy Advance, was well as the PC exclusive RPG \"GetBackers Dakkanoku: Metropolis Dakkan Sakusen!\". Two more fighting games, \"GetBackers Dakkanoku: Dakkandayo! Zenin Shuugou!\" and \"GetBackers Dakkanoku - Urashinshiku Saikyou Battle\", were released in 2003 and 2004, respectively. While the former was only for PCs, the latter was also released for the PlayStation 2. Rando Ayamine worked for all these video games, making illustrations for them.\n\nAs of January 2009, the \"GetBackers\" manga sold 18 million copies in Japan. English volumes from the manga have also been popular, appearing various times in Diamond Comic's rankings of best selling graphic novels. Anime News Network's Liann Cooper has commented on the manga, praising for using the \"simple concept\" in order to create an entertaining plot. The manga has been noted to have a large number of types of fan service, showing several kinds of beautiful women and noted a \"relationship\" between the two main characters and giving the series a nice \"bishōnen\" tone. The art of Rando Ayamine has been praised for having the dark and gritty mood emphasizes he makes in the series making readers think that the Jagan scene of Ban Mido is a \"horrifying nightmare\". The Tokyopop translation of the manga has been criticized for making the main characters sound like gangsters giving them strange dialogues. Cooper later noted that readers from Clamp's works or \"Rurouni Kenshin\" would find \"GetBackers\" appealing due to the several aspects it has. He still found issues with Tokyopop's translation, but still found the final product entertaining, also complimenting the series' comedy.\n\nThe anime adaptation of \"GetBackers\" was also well received. In the 26th annual \"Animage\" readers' poll, it took various categories: it was third in \"Favorite Anime Series\", ninth in \"Favorite Episode\" (episode 49) and fifth and eighth in \"Favorite Male Character\" (Ginji and Ban, respectively). It also received positive reviews ever since the first episode's premier in Japan. For such episode, Anime News Network liked the animations' quality as well as the main characters Ban and Ginji. The mix between drama and comedy was also well-received, hoping that it will continue like that for the remainder of the series. DVD Talk's John Sinnott called it a \"solid show\", enjoying the characters' growth as the series continued. However, he gave a low score the DVDs' presentation mainly due to the lack of extras. While comparing it with the manga, Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment found the anime's introduction more appealing than the manga's, but mentioned various issues already shown in the first episodes of various anime. Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network enjoyed how the story was built during the first season, finding appealing the fact that the characters he found appealing would take part in a larger story arc. Agreeing with Dong, Dani Moure from Mania liked the interaction between the characters, as well as a bigger exploration to some of them. Sinott concluded that the story arc involving the Limitless Fortress was \"a good story\" due to the expansion in the backgrounds from various of the main characters, but found it relatively longer than previous story arcs. Active Anime writer David C. Jones praised the focus on the anime's second season, liking how many secondary characters got their own episodes, as well as how the comedy was delivered across them, citing the episode focused on Ginji in the hospital as the best one from the season. On the other hand, Beveridge found that in the second season, characters were \"overused\", but like Jones, enjoyed the focus on other characters as well as the flashbacks exploring them. The anime's last story arc left mixed thoughts to Beveridge who found some of its events predictable or rushed, but still enjoyed the action sequences shown.\n\n"}

{"id": "1956038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956038", "title": "Cao Xiu", "text": "Cao Xiu\n\nCao Xiu (died 228), courtesy name Wenlie, was a military general of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period of China. A distant younger relative of the warlord Cao Cao, Cao Xiu started his career in the late Eastern Han dynasty as a military officer under Cao Cao. In the early stages of the Hanzhong Campaign of 217–219, he outwitted and defeated two enemy generals, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao. Later in his career, he became a provincial-level military commander and fought in various battles against Wei's rival state, Eastern Wu. He died in 228 shortly after the Wei defeat at the Battle of Shiting.\n\nCao Xiu was a distant younger relative of Cao Cao. When the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in the late Eastern Han dynasty, the Cao clan left their ancestral home in Qiao County (譙縣; present-day Bozhou, Anhui) and went in different directions throughout the Han Empire to avoid getting caught up in the chaos.\n\nWhen Cao Xiu was around 10 years old, his father died and he only had one person to help him arrange for his father to be properly buried. Cao Xiu and his mother crossed the Yangtze to southern China and settled down in Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu). Cao Xiu's grandfather, Cao Chang (曹嘗), had previously served as the Administrator of Wu Commandery. One day, after seeing a portrait of his grandfather in the Administrator's office, Cao Xiu became so overwhelmed by emotions that he knelt down and cried. Everyone present at the scene felt touched when they saw him crying.\n\nIn 190, Cao Cao was raising an army to join the Guandong Coalition against the warlord Dong Zhuo, who controlled the Han central government and held Emperor Xian hostage. When Cao Xiu heard about it, he adopted a fake identity and travelled via Jing Province to Cao Cao's base in Chenliu Commandery (陳留郡; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan). Cao Cao was pleased to see him and he remarked, \"This is the thousand-\"li\" horse of my clan.\"\n\nCao Cao treated Cao Xiu like a son and even allowed him to live with his own son, Cao Pi. Cao Xiu fought on Cao Cao's side in the various battles against rival warlords throughout the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was also one of the commanders of the elite \"Tiger and Leopard Cavalry\" (虎豹騎) unit in Cao Cao's army.\n\nIn 217, Cao Cao's rival Liu Bei launched a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery, which was guarded by Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan. When Liu Bei sent Wu Lan (吳蘭), one of his officers, to lead troops to garrison at Xiabian County (下辯縣; northwest of present-day Cheng County, Gansu), Cao Cao ordered his cousin Cao Hong to lead an army to attack the enemy. Cao Xiu was commissioned as a Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉) to serve as an adviser to Cao Hong. Before they left, Cao Cao told Cao Xiu, \"You may be an adviser, but you're actually the commander.\" When Cao Hong received the order, he delegated his command to Cao Xiu.\n\nLiu Bei later sent his generals Ma Chao and Zhang Fei to lead troops to Gushan (固山) and station there in an attempt to cut off Cao Hong's retreat route. When Cao Hong and his subordinates were unsure about what Ma Chao and Zhang Fei were trying to do, Cao Xiu pointed out that it was a ruse because the enemy would do so in secret if they really wanted to cut off the retreat route, instead of making it so obvious. He then suggested to Cao Hong to attack Wu Lan at Xiabian County before he could link up with Ma Chao and Zhang Fei, and said that Ma Chao and Zhang Fei would retreat once they learn of Wu Lan's defeat. Cao Hong heeded his suggestion and defeated Wu Lan at Xiabian County. As Cao Xiu foresaw, Ma Chao and Zhang Fei pulled back their troops from Gushan after hearing of Wu Lan's defeat.\n\nIn 219, after a prolonged war against Liu Bei, Cao Cao eventually decided to give up defending Hanzhong Commandery so he ordered his troops to withdraw and return to Chang'an. Later, he appointed Cao Xiu as Commandant of the Central Army (中領軍).\n\nFollowing Cao Cao's death in March 220, his son Cao Pi succeeded him as the (vassal) King of Wei (魏王) and Imperial Chancellor (丞相) of the Eastern Han dynasty. Cao Pi appointed Cao Xiu as General Who Leads the Army (領軍將軍) and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Dongyang Village (東陽亭侯) in recognition of his past achievements. When Xiahou Dun died in June 220, Cao Pi ordered Cao Xiu to replace Xiahou Dun as the supervisor of all military operations, promoted him to General Who Guards the South (鎮南將軍) and granted him acting imperial authority. He held Cao Xiu's hands while personally seeing him off.\n\nAt the time, Cao Pi's rival Sun Quan had sent his forces to garrison at Liyang County (歷陽縣; present-day He County, Anhui) in preparation for an attack on Cao Pi's territories. When Cao Xiu reached his assigned position at Zhaoling County (召陵縣; east of present-day Luohe, Henan), he led his troops to attack Liyang County and succeeded in driving Sun Quan's forces away. Later, he sent his troops to cross the Yangtze and attack and burn down a few thousand enemy camps at Wuhu County (蕪湖縣; east of present-day Wuhu, Anhui).\n\nIn late 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei with himself as the new emperor. After his coronation, he promoted Cao Xiu to General Who Attacks the East (征東將軍) and appointed him as the Inspector (刺史) of Yang Province. He also elevated Cao Xiu from the status of a village marquis to a district marquis under the title \"Marquis of Anyang District\" (安陽鄉侯).\n\nWhen Cao Xiu's mother died, Cao Pi issued an imperial decree to exempt Cao Xiu from the formalities and austere lifestyle of filial mourning, which was customary for officeholders when their parent(s) died. He excused Cao Xiu from wearing mourning garments and gave him permission to consume meat and alcohol. However, when Cao Xiu's health deteriorated due to grief and his desire to return home to Qiao County (譙縣; present-day Bozhou, Anhui) to hold a proper funeral for his mother, Cao Pi approved and sent Xue Qiao (薛喬) as his personal representative to offer his condolences to Cao Xiu and attend the funeral. Cao Xiu settled the funeral arrangements and had his mother properly buried within one day, after which he wanted to return to his post. Before Cao Xiu left, Cao Pi met him in person to comfort and console him. This incident showed how close Cao Pi was to Cao Xiu and how highly he regarded Cao Xiu.\n\nIn October 222, Cao Pi launched the first of a series of invasions against Eastern Wu, the state founded by his rival, Sun Quan. He promoted Cao Xiu to Senior General Who Attacks the East (征東大將軍), granted him the yellow axe (a ceremonial axe given to newly appointed high-ranking generals), and ordered him, Zhang Liao and others to lead 20 armies to attack Dongkou (洞口; in present-day southern Jiangsu), where they defeated Wu forces led by Lü Fan. Cao Pi later promoted Cao Xiu to Governor of Yang Province.\n\nAfter Cao Pi died in June 226, Cao Xiu continued serving under Cao Rui, Cao Pi's son and successor as the emperor of Wei. Following his coronation, Cao Rui elevated Cao Xiu from the status of a district marquis to a county marquis under the title \"Marquis of Changping\" (長平侯).\n\nWhen Wu forces led by Shen De (審悳) garrisoned at Wan (皖; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui), Cao Xiu led Wei forces to attack them and killed Shen De in battle. Two other Wu officers, Han Zong and Zhai Dan (翟丹), brought along their troops and surrendered to Cao Xiu. In recognition of Cao Xiu's achievements, Cao Rui increased the number of taxable households in Cao Xiu's marquisate by 400, bringing the total number to 2,500. Cao Rui also promoted Cao Xiu to Grand Marshal (大司馬) and ordered him to continue supervising military operations in Yang Province.\n\nIn 228, as Cao Rui planned to launch an invasion on Wei's rival state Wu, he ordered Sima Yi to lead Wei forces from Jing Province and sail down the Han River to Xunyang County (尋陽縣; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei) and supervise the invasion. During this time, Cao Xiu fell for a ruse by a Wu military officer Zhou Fang, who pretended to defect to Wei in order to lure Wei forces into a trap. He led his troops deep into enemy territory and suffered a disastrous defeat when they fell into the trap. Cao Xiu managed to retreat to Shiting (石亭; or Shi Village, in present-day Qianshan County, Anhui), but his soldiers started panicking at night and many of them deserted and left behind their weapons, armour and equipment.\n\nCao Xiu wrote a memorial to Cao Rui to apologise for his blunder and request to be punished. However, Cao Rui not only pardoned him, but also sent Yang Ji (楊曁) as an emissary to console him and continued to regard him as highly as before.\n\nCao Xiu died later in 228 from skin infections on his back resulting from the wounds he sustained during the Battle of Shiting. Cao Rui honoured with the posthumous title \"Marquis Zhuang\" (壯侯), which literally means \"robust marquis\".\n\nCao Xiu's son, Cao Zhao (曹肇), whose courtesy name was Changsi (長思), inherited his father's peerage and marquisate as the Marquis of Changping (長平侯). Cao Zhao, who was known for being talented and generous, served as a Regular Mounted Attendant (散騎常侍) and Colonel of the Garrison Cavalry (屯騎校尉) in the Cao Wei state. When Cao Rui became critically ill in 238, he wanted to appoint Cao Zhao and Cao Yu as the regents for Cao Fang, his adopted son and successor-to-be. However, later he changed his mind and ordered Cao Zhao to retire and go home. Cao Zhao died in the middle of the Zhengshi era (240–249) of Cao Fang's reign. He was posthumously awarded the appointment General of the Guards (衞將軍). His son, Cao Xing (曹興), succeeded him as the next Marquis of Changping.\n\nCao Xiu had another son, Cao Cuan (曹纂), who was younger than Cao Zhao. Sometime between 220 and 226, Cao Pi removed 300 taxable households from Cao Xiu's marquisate and used them to create a new marquisate for Cao Cuan. Like his father and elder brother, Cao Cuan served in the Cao Wei state and held the position General Who Destroys Wu (殄吳將軍). After his death, he was posthumously awarded the appointment General of the Vanguard (前將軍).\n\nCao Xiu had a great-grandson, Cao Shu (曹攄), whose courtesy name was Yanyuan (顏遠) and was a grandson of Cao Zhao. Cao Shu was known for being virtuous, ambitious, knowledgeable and well-read since young. He served under the Jin dynasty (265–420) after the fall of the Cao Wei state in 265 and gained quite a reputation during his tenure as the Prefect of Luoyang. When Sima Jiong was regent for Emperor Hui, Cao Shu and Zuo Si served as his subordinates. Cao Shu later rose through the ranks from a Palace Gentleman (中郎) to the positions of Administrator of Xiangyang (襄陽太守) and Marshal Who Attacks the South (征南司馬). He was killed in battle in 308 while suppressing a rebellion.\n\nIn May 2010, archaeologists announced the discovery of Cao Xiu's tomb in Mengjin County, Henan. The tomb, 50 metres long and 21 metres wide, held chinaware, copperware, liquor cups and jars as well as some human bones. Tests suggested that these bones belonged to a 50-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman, and the man was about 1.71 metres tall. A bronze seal, about the size of a coin and engraved with Cao Xiu's name, revealed the tomb owner's identity.\n\nIn the 14th-century historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", on one occasion when Yue Jin was losing to the enemy general Ling Tong in a duel, Cao Xiu fired an arrow which hit Ling Tong's horse. Ling Tong fell from the horse's back and would have been killed by Yue Jin if Gan Ning had not intervened and saved him.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1956039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956039", "title": "Private Securities Litigation Reform Act", "text": "Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\n\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-67, 109 Stat. 737 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 15 U.S.C.) (\"PSLRA\") implemented several substantive changes in the United States, affecting certain cases brought under the federal securities laws, including changes related to pleading, discovery, liability, class representation, and awards fees and expenses.\n\nThe PSLRA was designed to limit frivolous securities lawsuits. Prior to the PSLRA, plaintiffs could proceed with minimal evidence of fraud and then use pretrial discovery to seek further proof. This set a very low barrier to initiate litigation, which encouraged the filing of weak or entirely frivolous suits. Defending against these suits could prove extremely costly, even when the charges were unfounded, so defendants often found it cheaper to settle than fight and win. Under the PSLRA, however, plaintiffs are required to meet a heightened pleading standard before they can initiate a suit. In other words, PSLRA was specifically intended to make it more difficult to initiate securities litigation (frivolous or otherwise) because plaintiffs were supposedly going to be forced to present evidence of fraud before any pretrial discovery has taken place. \n\nAlso, PSLRA was enacted to \"give teeth to Rule 11\". In fact, Congress specifically pointed to the reluctance of judges to impose Rule 11 sanctions as an additional reason for the passage of the legislation. \n\nThe PSLRA does impose some new rules on securities class action lawsuits. It allows judges to decide the most adequate plaintiff in class actions, favoring institutional investors with large dollar amounts at stake. It mandates full disclosure to investors of proposed settlements, including the amount of attorneys' fees. It bars bonus payments to favored plaintiffs and permits judges to scrutinize lawyer conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (commonly known as the \"Exchange Act\" or the \"1934 Act\") gives shareholders the right to bring a private action in federal court to recover damages the shareholder sustained as a result of securities fraud. The majority of securities fraud claims are brought pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 78j), as well as pursuant to SEC Rule 10b-5, which the SEC promulgated under the authority granted to it by Congress under the Exchange Act. (This article refers to federal securities fraud actions as \"Rule 10b-5 actions\" or \"Rule 10b-5 cases\" as convenient shorthand.)\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that there are six elements that a plaintiff must allege and prove in order to prevail in a Rule 10b-5 action:\n\nEach of these elements has been heavily litigated in thousands of cases over the past 70 years, and the courts have applied these six elements in a multitude of different factual situations.\n\nIn a typical Rule 10b-5 claim, the plaintiff will commence the action by filing a complaint in federal court. The defendant will then file a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is essentially an argument by the defendant that, even if all of the facts alleged in the complaint were assumed to be true, those facts would not be sufficient to give rise to liability under Rule 10b-5. If the court determines that the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to state a Rule 10b-5 claim, the plaintiff then becomes entitled to obtain \"discovery\" from the defendant—which typically means the right to demand documentary evidence in the defendant's possession concerning the facts at issue, and the right to require the defendant (and other witnesses) to sit for depositions.\n\nIn a modern litigation context, the discovery process is protracted and very expensive, often involving production of millions of pages of documents and depositions of dozens of witnesses, costing the defendant as much as millions of dollars in legal fees. Thus, it is extremely important to the litigants whether a motion to dismiss is granted, as the costs of litigation increase substantially when the motion to dismiss is denied.\n\nIf the plaintiff's complaint survives the defendant's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the next step is usually for the plaintiff to seek class certification under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If the court grants the plaintiff's motion for class certification, the case becomes a securities fraud class action. At this point, the defendant usually faces enormous liability if the case goes to trial and the jury renders a verdict against the defendant.\n\nFor example, if the plaintiff class is composed of 50,000 shareholders, each shareholder owns an average of 1,000 shares, and each shareholder claims to have sustained losses of $10 per share, the potential compensatory damages are $500 million. Therefore, as a practical matter, if a Rule 10b-5 case is not dismissed on a motion to dismiss, and if the case is certified as a class action, the defendant will face a lot of pressure to settle the case. Even if the plaintiff has a relatively weak case, the expected value of going to trial will put the defendant under pressure to settle. That is, the cost of significantly high damages, even when multiplied by the small chance of losing a jury verdict, may still be very high.\n\nThus, the outcome of a motion to dismiss in a Rule 10b-5 case essentially determines whether the case gets dismissed or whether it proceeds to discovery and, very often, results in class certification and a very large settlement. Because the motion to dismiss is a pivotal stage in the course of a Rule 10b-5 case, the attorneys for plaintiffs and defendants argue fiercely over the rules that govern such motion to dismiss. Plaintiff lawyers advocate less demanding standards, as such standards would result in a larger number of cases to proceed to discovery and higher amounts of settlements. Defense lawyers and the corporations they represent, on the other hand, advocate more demanding standards, for opposite reasons. \n\nBoth sides in this debate use rhetoric that claims the mantle of \"justice\". The defense bar generally contends that lower pleading standards will allow more frivolous lawsuits and extorted settlements that primarily benefit plaintiff lawyers, not shareholders. On the other hand, the plaintiffs' bar claims that higher pleading standards will enable corporate executives to loot their companies and defraud innocent shareholders with impunity.\n\nThe importance of the ratification of the PSLRA in 1995 can be fully appreciated only when one notes such long-running debate between the plaintiff bar and the defense bar over the applicable standards governing Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss in Rule 10b-5 claims.\n\nThe legislative history reveals that Congress passed the PSLRA to curb the \"abusive practices committed in private securities litigation\" including \"the routine filing of lawsuits against issuers of securities and others whenever there is a significant change in an issuer's stock price, without regard to any underlying culpability of the issuer, and with only faint hope that the discovery process might lead eventually to some plausible cause of action.\"\n\nTo reduce the number of purportedly frivolous Rule 10b-5 lawsuits that survive motions to dismiss, the PSLRA raised the pleading standards (the specificity and strength of the factual allegations that must be alleged in the plaintiff's complaint) in three specific ways. These changes are among the most significant aspects of the PSLRA.\n\nThe PSLRA requires a plaintiff to identify in his complaint \"each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1). If a plaintiff's complaint does not specifically identify the allegedly fraudulent statements and explain why they were misleading, the complaint will be dismissed. By requiring plaintiffs to set forth their theory regarding why a particular statement was misleading, the PSLRA enables defendants to put forth arguments as to why the challenged statement was not, in fact, misleading. Note that Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure already required that allegations of fraud be pleaded with particularity.\n\nThe PSLRA also requires a plaintiff to allege that the defendant acted with the required state of mind, i.e., that he knew the challenged statement was false at the time it was made, or was reckless in not recognizing that the statement was false (the legal term of art for this state of mind is \"scienter\"). In alleging scienter under the PSLRA, the plaintiff must, \"with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2). This requirement allows defendants to obtain dismissal of cases where the plaintiff merely points to a false statement and declares that the defendant \"must have known\" that the statement was false, based upon his position within the company.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and issued June 21, 2007, interpreted this standard. The US Supreme Court ruled that for plaintiffs to allege a \"strong inference\" of intentional fraud, the inference must be \"cogent\" and \"at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.\" The US Circuit Courts of Appeal had adopted substantially disparate tests for determining whether scienter is sufficiently pleaded:\nFour circuits, the First, Fourth, Sixth and Ninth, require a direct comparison of the plausibility of competing inferences. Unless the culpable inference is the \"most plausible,\" it is not \"strong\" and the complaint should be dismissed. Two circuits, the Eighth and the Tenth, consider all inferences, both of scienter and of an innocent mental state, using the innocent inferences to test whether the culpable interest is strong, but do not directly weigh one against the other. The Second and Third circuits divide the factual allegations bearing on a defendant's mental state into categories, \"motive and opportunity\" and \"strong circumstantial evidence\" of knowing or reckless conduct, either of which may independently satisfy the strong inference requirement. And, the Seventh Circuit... did not consider competing inferences, but concluded that if an inference of culpability exists, the pleading is sufficient.\n\nFinally, the PSLRA also makes clear that a plaintiff in a Rule 10b-5 case \"shall have the burden of proving that the act or omission of the defendant... caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages\" (15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(4)). At one time, there was a question over whether this requirement actually applied at the motion to dismiss stage. The statute says the plaintiff must \"prove\" loss causation. It does not say the plaintiff must \"allege\" loss causation. However, after the Supreme Court's decision in \"Dura Pharmaceuticals v. Broudo\", it is now clear that a plaintiff must allege loss causation in its complaint.\n\nThe \"Dura\" decision held that a plaintiff in a Rule 10b-5 case had not adequately pleaded loss causation by merely alleging that he \"paid artificially inflated prices for Dura securities\" at the time of purchase. The Supreme Court observed that an investor who purchases a stock at an artificially inflated price suffers no economic loss at the time of purchase. The loss occurs only when the truth is disclosed and the stock price falls as a result. Thus, a plaintiff who sells his shares \"before the relevant truth begins to leak out\" does not suffer any economic damage. The plaintiff in Dura failed to allege that the \"share price fell significantly after the truth became known\", and therefore the complaint had not alleged loss causation.\n\nHow a court defines the \"relevant truth\" that the defendant fraudulently withheld often determines the outcome of a 10b-5 case. The stock analyst cases provide a good example of the importance of how the \"relevant truth\" is defined. The claim in most stock analyst cases has been that the analyst dishonestly touted a particular stock as a good investment when that was not the analyst's genuine belief. Under Dura, these cases have often been dismissed because, in most instances, the analyst's dishonesty never comes to light until after the price of the stock in question has declined substantially. By that point, the \"bad facts\" about the company have already been absorbed by the market and so plaintiffs cannot show that the disclosure of the analyst's dishonesty caused any further decline in the stock price.\n\nTo prevent discovery until a court has deemed a securities fraud complaint sufficient, the PSLRA also imposes a stay of all discovery \"during the pendency of any motion to dismiss.\" This stay operates against all parties, including both plaintiffs and defendants. \n\nThe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act amends this provision to allow a federal court to impose the discovery stay on related securities suits in state court.\n\nPSLRA Section 301 adds additional duties to a firm's auditor, including a requirement to report evidence of illegal activity to the firm's Board of Directors, or the Board of Directors' Audit Committee. The Board of Directors or sub-unit is consequently obligated to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of such notification by auditors within one day. If the auditing accountant does not receive a copy of the SEC notification within one day, the auditor is obliged to withdraw from the engagement and notify the SEC directly of the report made to the Board. This provision constitutes an important affirmative requirement of auditors to breach confidentiality. Although PSLRA reduced the public protections from fraudulent operations within a public company that issue from fraudster's aversion to civil liability, the burden of decreasing fraud risk is shifted by PSLRA to auditors of public firms who presumably have deeper access to critical financial operations and details.\n\nThe PSLRA was enacted into law by the U.S. Congress over a veto by President Bill Clinton. The U.S. House of Representatives approved the bill by a 319–100 margin, and the U.S. Senate approved it, 68–30. Every Republican in the House voted in favor of the legislation, and only four Republicans in the Senate voted against it: William Cohen, John McCain, Richard Shelby, and Arlen Specter. Prominent liberals in the Democratic Party like senators Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, Claiborne Pell, and Carol Moseley Braun voted in favor of the legislation while many conservative-to-moderate Democrats such as senators John Breaux, Robert Byrd, Fritz Hollings, and Sam Nunn and representatives such as John Murtha and Gene Taylor voted against it. Only one other time during Bill Clinton's presidency, Congress successfully overrode one of his 37 vetoes to enact a bill into law.\n\nThe PSLRA was originally developed as part of Newt Gingrich's Contract With America. Its principal authors in the House were Representatives Thomas Bliley, Jack Fields and Christopher Cox. Senators Chris Dodd and Pete Domenici sponsored the legislation in the Senate.\n\n\n"}

Indeed, many of the masses listed in the table below are inferred from theory, using difficult measurements of the stars’ temperatures and absolute brightnesses. All the masses listed below are uncertain: both the theory and the measurements are pushing the limits of current knowledge and technology. Either measurement or theory, or both, could be incorrect. For example, VV Cephei could be between , or , depending on which property of the star is examined.\nMassive stars are rare; astronomers must look very far from the Earth to find one. All the listed stars are many thousands of light years away and that alone makes measurements difficult.\n\nIn addition to being far away, many stars of such extreme mass are surrounded by clouds of outflowing gas created by powerful stellar winds; the surrounding gas interferes with the already difficult-to-obtain measurements of stellar temperatures and brightnesses and greatly complicates the issue of estimating internal chemical compositions.\n\nBoth the obscuring clouds and the great distances make it difficult to judge whether the star is just a single supermassive object or, instead, a multiple star system. A number of the \"stars\" listed below may actually be two or more companions orbiting too closely to distinguish, each star being massive in itself but not necessarily “supermassive”. Other combinations are possible – for example a supermassive star with one or more smaller companions or more than one giant star – but without being able to see inside the surrounding cloud, it is difficult to know the truth of the matter. More globally, statistics on stellar populations seem to indicate that the upper mass limit is in the 100–200 solar mass range.\n\nEclipsing binary stars are the only stars whose masses are estimated with some confidence. However note that almost all of the masses listed in the table below were inferred by indirect methods; only a few of the masses in the table were determined using eclipsing systems.\n\nAmongst the most reliable listed masses are those for the eclipsing binaries NGC 3603-A1, WR 21a, and WR 20a. Masses for all three were obtained from orbital measurements. This involves measuring their radial velocities and also their light curves. The radial velocities only yield minimum values for the masses, depending on inclination, but light curves of eclipsing binaries provide the missing information: inclination of the orbit to our line of sight.\n\nSome stars may once have been heavier than they are today. It is likely that many have suffered significant mass loss, perhaps as much as several tens of solar masses, expelled by the process of superwind, where high velocity winds are driven by the hot photosphere into interstellar space. This process is similar to superwinds generated by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in form red giants or planetary nebulae. The process forms an enlarged extended envelope around the star that interacts with the nearby interstellar medium and infusing the region with elements heavier than Hydrogen or Helium.\n\nThere are also – or rather \"were\" – stars that might have appeared on the list but no longer exist as stars, or are supernova impostors; today we see only the debris. The masses of the precursor stars that fueled these cataclysms can be estimated from the type of explosion and the energy released, but those masses are not listed here (see § Black holes below).\n\nThere are two related theoretical limits on how massive a star can possibly be: the accretion limit and the Eddington mass limit. The accretion limit is related to star formation: After about 120  have accreted in a protostar, the combined mass should have become hot enough for its heat to drive away any further incoming matter. In effect, the protostar reaches a point where it evaporates away material as fast as it collects new material. \nThe Eddington limit is based on light pressure from the core of an already-formed star: As mass increases past ~150 , the intensity of light radiated from a Population I star's core will become sufficient for the light-pressure pushing outward to exceed the gravitational force pulling inward, and the surface material of the star will be free to float away into space.\n\nAstronomers have long hypothesized that as a protostar grows to a size beyond 120 , something drastic must happen. Although the limit can be stretched for very early Population III stars, and although the exact value is uncertain, if any stars still exist above 150–200  they would challenge current theories of stellar evolution.\n\nStudying the Arches Cluster, which is currently the densest known cluster of stars in our galaxy, astronomers have confirmed that stars in that cluster do not occur any larger than about 150 .\n\nRare ultramassive stars that exceed this limit – for example in the R136 star cluster – might be explained by the following proposal: Some of the pairs of massive stars in close orbit in young, unstable multiple-star systems must occasionally collide and merge where certain unusual circumstances hold that make a collision possible.\n\nA limit on stellar mass arises because of light-pressure: For a sufficiently massive star the outward pressure of radiant energy generated by nuclear fusion in the star's core exceeds the inward pull of its own gravity. This effect is called the Eddington limit.\n\nStars of greater mass have a higher rate of core energy generation, and heavier stars' luminosities increase far out of proportion to the increase in their masses. The Eddington limit is the point beyond which a star ought to push itself apart, or at least shed enough mass to reduce its internal energy generation to a lower, maintainable rate. The actual limit-point mass depends on how opaque the gas in the star is, and metal-rich Population I stars have lower mass limits than metal-poor Population II stars, with the hypothetical metal-free Population III stars having the highest allowed mass, somewhere around 300 .\n\nIn theory, a more massive star could not hold itself together because of the mass loss resulting from the outflow of stellar material. In practice the theoretical Eddington Limit must be modified for high luminosity stars and the empirical Humphreys–Davidson limit is used instead.\n\nThe following two lists show a few of the known stars with an estimated mass of 25  or greater, including the stars of Arches Cluster, Cygnus OB2 cluster, Pismis 24 cluster, and R136 cluster.\n\nThe first list gives stars that are estimated to be 80  or larger. The majority of stars thought to be more than 100  are shown, but the list is incomplete.\n\nThe second list gives examples of stars 25–79 , but is far from a complete list. Note that \"all\" O-type stars have masses greater than 15  and catalogs of such stars (GOSS, Reed) list hundreds of cases.\n\nIn each list, the method used to determine the mass is included to give an idea of uncertainty: Binary stars being more securely determined than indirect methods such as conversion from luminosity, extrapolation from stellar atmosphere models, ... . The masses listed below are the stars’ \"current\" (evolved) mass, not their initial (formation) mass.\n\nA few examples of mass less than 80 .\n\nBlack holes are the end point evolution of massive stars. Technically they are not stars, as they no longer generate heat and light via nuclear fusion in their cores.\n\n"}

The building is shaped like a truncated tent with trapezoidal sides on the north and south ends. It is home to the men's and women's Rutgers Scarlet Knights basketball teams as well as the wrestling and gymnastic teams. Previously, the University used the 3,200-seat College Avenue Gym from 1931 to 1977.\n\nThe arena opened on November 30, 1977 with a win against rival Seton Hall.\n\nThe arena was known as the Rutgers Athletic Center until 1986, when it was renamed for Louis Brown, a Rutgers graduate and former member of the varsity golf team, who made a large bequest to the University in his will. Despite the name change, the building was still largely referred to as \"The RAC\" (pronounced \"rack\") by students, alumni, fans, and players.\n\nIn 2019, all references to Louis Brown were quietly removed from the arena and all University websites. Following this, all university publications have begun using the arena's original name, \"The Rutgers Athletic Center.\"\n\nThe RAC is renowned for being one of the loudest arenas in college basketball when at maximum capacity. The trapezoidal design of the building allows the crowd noise to resonate, creating a deafening environment. The RAC has even been described as being \"louder than a 747 at Newark Airport.\"\n\nESPN's Jay Bilas has lauded the RAC, saying, \"The Scarlet Knights play great there, and the crowd is right on top of you and intimidating.\"\n\nFormer opponents have also extolled the RAC's atmosphere. Former Connecticut Guard Ben Gordon said, \"It is very difficult at the RAC. They have a great home crowd. The student body and everybody really comes out to support them. Just the way the gym is shaped, it seems like everybody is on top of you. At times, if you're not focused, you can get lost in the game just by how intense the crowd is.\"\n\nFormer Syracuse forward Hakim Warrick notes that \"they (the fans) are definitely some of the best fans on the road that I’ve played against. It's crazy how much they love their team. The way the gym is made, it's just made to keep the noise in. It's loud and crazy down there.\"\n\nThe arena was the home of the NBA's New Jersey Nets from their second year in the NBA, 1977, when the team moved from The Nassau Coliseum, until 1981, when the Brendan Byrne Arena opened at the Meadowlands Sports Complex. It also hosted the 1985 and 1989 Atlantic 10 Conference men's basketball tournaments. The arena is also the site for the girls and boys Middlesex County high school basketball tournament finals, and various boys and girls New Jersey high school basketball state playoff games. On Saturday April 13, 1996, a Professional Bowler's Association tournament was broadcast live from the arena on ABC, the Johnny Petraglia Open.\n\nThe Grateful Dead played at the Rutgers Athletic Center on May 15, 1981. Styx brought their Grand Illusion to the RAC on October 24, 1979. Linda Ronstadt also played here on her \"Living in the USA\" tour and sang with a terrible sore throat. Also, Linda Ronstadt played the RAC on April 11, 1980 for her \"Mad Love\" tour, and on October 22, 1987, R.E.M. played the RAC with 10,000 Maniacs opening.\n\nThe arena was used on Friday, April 27, 2007 for Rutgersfest, an annual concert normally held outdoors, but held in the RAC that time due to rain. The performers were The Roots, Hawthorne Heights, and Everclear. Due to lack of seating, only 5,000 tickets were given out, angering the 15,000 or so (est.) other students who were then unable to attend.\n\nMay 3, 2008 The RAC hosted SpringBlaze 2008, a concert featuring Christian rock bands with a special appearance by Rutgers Football Head Coach Greg Schiano.\n\nOn December 2, 1983 a local nonprofit, Visions-Innervisions Productions, hosted a fundraiser for Headstart and other community services at the RAC beginning with the annual university Step-Show, viewing the debut of Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" on 20' screens, one above each hoop, followed by Motown's D-Train, live.\n\nThe arena is used every June as a graduation hall for Piscataway Township High School, Edison High School, and North Brunswick Township High School, as well as for other high schools in surrounding cities. The graduations are free for anyone to attend.\n\nStarting in 2014, Rutgers University Dance Marathon is held at the RAC, having moved from the College Avenue Gym.\n\nThe Newark, New Jersey-based \"Star-Ledger\" and the Rutgers University newspaper, \"The Daily Targum\" have reported that former Rutgers Athletic Director Tim Pernetti planned to expand the Louis Brown Athletic Center to include more practice facilities, more concourse space, and a seating expansion to accommodate 12,500 fans, including club seating and premium restaurants. Pernetti also stated that he wanted to book more concerts at the arena and at nearby Rutgers Stadium.\n\nIn its current configuration, the RAC is the smallest arena in the Big Ten Conference when the Scarlet Knights joined July 1, 2014, with slightly fewer seats than the 8,117 at Northwestern's Welsh-Ryan Arena. Due to the scheduled renovations of Welsh-Ryan during the 2017-18 season, in which the listed capacity will decrease to 7,500, Welsh-Ryan will once again become the smallest arena in the Big 10 Conference starting in 2018. The other 12 Big Ten schools' arenas all seat at least 12,500.\n\n"}

According to producer Kenneth Lee, who took over starting with Volume 3, the remaining episodes will not have this restriction.\n\nIn the Italian dub, when Asuka Jr. reads a notice from Saint Tail, rather than display the notice written in Japanese, a short scene of Saint Tail running in the dark is shown while her voice reads out the notice's message. The notice scenes are cut from the Korean dub, presumably due to Japanese text.\nIn Korea, several episodes were cut entirely and not broadcast.

It is the largest maximum security prison and the third oldest prison in New York. The staff includes about a thousand officers and supervisors.\n\nIn the post-\"Furman v. Georgia\" period and prior to the 2008 repeal of the death penalty, it housed the New York State death row for men.\n\nBuilt in 1844, the prison originally served as a site where prisoners were used to supply labor to local mines in both Dannemora and nearby Lyon Mountain. This enterprise was not profitable, and by 1877, mining had ended with the prisoners being put to work on other trades.\n\nAs the population grew and more prisoners were housed there, in 1887 authorities had new 60-foot- high walls built, which still stand. In 1892, the first prisoner was executed in the electric chair at the prison. Twenty-six men were executed between 1892 and 1913. This period also saw many prisoners cured of tuberculosis, due in part to the clean air in the Adirondacks. (Antibiotics were not then available to treat the frequently fatal disease.) Prisoners diagnosed with the disease were frequently transferred from other prisons.\n\nIn 1899, a mental health facility, the Dannemora State Hospital, was built on the grounds to house prisoners who became insane while serving their sentence. Such prisoners were retained in the facility if they remained insane following the completion of their sentence.\nIn 1929, Clinton Correctional was the site of a riot, Coupled with riots in other prisons in that year, it led to prison reform in New York State. Included was the construction of schools in the prison and the renovation or rebuilding of most of the structures within the prison walls in order to update the facilities to modern standards.\n\nThe Church of St. Dismas, the Good Thief was built from 1939 to 1941. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991 as a significant structure. In the later half of the 20th century, the prison's mental institutions closed and were converted into an annex to house more prisoners.\n\nOn June 6, 2015, inmates Richard Matt and David Sweat, both serving sentences for murder, escaped from the facility. Two prison employees, Joyce Mitchell and Gene Palmer, were charged with aiding the escape. During the search, on June 26, Matt was shot and killed by a border patrol agent in the town of Malone, New York. Two days later, Sweat was shot by a New York State Trooper and subsequently captured. In the days after the escape, some prisoners reported having been beaten by guards in an attempt to obtain information as to the whereabouts and plans of the escaped inmates.\n\n\n\n"}

She is a cheerful orange-haired fourteen-year-old student at St. Paulia's Private School, with some minor attributes of a tsundere when she bickers with Daiki. At school, her strong point is physical education, but she is rather poor at math. By night she transforms into , who has a long ponytail for her hairstyle, and is usually dressed in purple-black. In this guise, she takes back what bad people have stolen. Unlike magical girls, Saint Tail does not have actual magic powers; instead, she uses stage magic and theatrics, along with acrobatics to fool and confuse pursuers. She is given information by her classmate, and nun-in-training, Seira, of misdeeds. Her catch phrase is: \"It's showtime!\"\n\nSaint Tail is persistently pursued by Asuka Jr - by his request, she sends him notices of her crimes in advance, so he may have a fighting chance. As Saint Tail, Meimi consistently outwits Asuka Jr. in her capers, and as she observes his exclusive devotion to pursuing her, she begins to fall in love with him. As Meimi Haneoka, she usually ends up arguing with Asuka Jr as all he cares about is catching Saint Tail. As a result, Meimi constantly gets jealous of her alter ego. In episode 26 of the anime, Ryutaro Tomikoji proposes to Meimi, but later on falls for Saint Tail instead.\n\nIn the final episode, Asuka Jr. discovers Saint Tail's true identity, but still keeps his romantic feelings for Meimi intact regardless. Meimi gives up her identity as Saint Tail in the process, claiming that Saint Tail 'has been put behind bars'. In the epilogue, which is set 8 years later, Daiki proposes to Meimi with an engagement ring, which she gratefully accepts. Meimi has also cut her hair short; now similar to that of Rina's hair length.\n\nDaiki Asuka is a detective boy fourteen-year-old at St. Paulia's Private School, and is a top student in his class. He lacks physical strength and motor skills.\n\nCommonly known as Asuka Jr., Daiki Asuka is the son of Detective Tomoki Asuka. Because Tomoki has been unable to catch Kaitou Lucifer (Meimi's mom), and also the fact that he is evidently apathetic of Saint Tail's crimes, Asuka Jr. takes up the mantle on capturing Saint Tail instead.\n\nAsuka Jr. is awarded a badge from the mayor, after he manages to snap a photo of Saint Tail. The badge grants Asuka Jr. the authority to investigate anywhere he pleases, and as such he is now able to assist the police in Saint Tail's capture. At his own request, Asuka Jr. is given prior notice of Saint Tail's crimes. As Saint Tail slips away from Asuka Jr. caper after caper, she becomes the object of Asuka Jr.'s thoughts.\n\nVery dense regarding relationships, Asuka Jr. fails to see Meimi's growing feelings for him. He often argues with Meimi over Saint Tail and his inability to catch her. Asuka Jr. begins to think of Meimi when he sees Saint Tail, and vice versa, and is torn between which of the two he's falling in love with. Despite that, he confesses to Meimi that he loves her in episode 40, with Meimi reciprocating his feelings. Only in the last episode of the anime does he know that Meimi is Saint Tail. Contrary to Meimi's constant fear of Daiki would hate her if he ever found out her true identity, she was proven wrong when Asuka Jr holds her tight and affectionately in the final episode after falling through the ceiling. Daiki states that he has caught Saint Tail and that she will be \"put behind bars\" so there's no reason for Meimi to be Saint Tail anymore. 8 years later, in the epilogue, Asuka Jr proposes to Meimi, in which she happily accepts.\n\nSeira Mimori is a quiet and mature, thirteen-year-old student at St. Paulia's Private School and a nun-in training at the school's church. Classmate and best friend of Meimi Haneoka, she is the only person who knows the real identity of Saint Tail. After school, Seira spends her time at the chapel as a nun; there are many people who come to her and talk about their problems, usually involving something being stolen or going missing. She relays this information to Meimi/Saint Tail, asking her to help these people recover their valued possessions. She was the first one to realize Meimi's love for Asuka Jr. In some instances she also advised Meimi to give up being Saint Tail, so as to not hurt Asuka Jr. if he finds out. In the epilogue, Seira is shown to have become a professional nun.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It lies north of Tonga, northeast of Fiji, east-northeast of the Hoorn Islands, east of Fiji's Rotuma, southeast of Tuvalu, southwest of Tokelau and west of Samoa. Its area is almost with 8,333 people. Its capital is Matāutu. Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion. Its highest point is Mount Lulu Fakahega (). Wallis is of volcanic origin with fertile soil and some remaining lakes. Rainfall is plentiful.\n\nIt was part of the Tongan maritime empire from around the 13th to 16th century. By that time the influence of the Tui Tonga had declined so much that Uvea became important in itself. The big fortress of Talietumu close to Lotoalahi in Mua was the last holdout of the Tongans until they were defeated. The island was renamed \"Wallis\" after a Cornish navigator, Captain Samuel Wallis, who saw it while sailing aboard on 16 August 1767. On 5 April 1842, the authorities of Wallis Island requested protection by France with a protectorate treaty signed in April 1887. After a referendum in 1959, Wallis became a French Overseas Territory in 1961.\n\nThe island has an area of and a circumference of c. . Its highest point is Mount Lulu Fakahega, which rises . There are also a few large lakes such as Lake Lalolalo. These crater lakes attest to the island's volcanic origin. Some of the lakes, such as Lalolalo and Lanu'tavake appear as almost perfect circles with straight vertical walls.\nWallis Island is located northeast of Futuna and Alofi islands which form the Hoorn archipelago. Together with some 15 smaller islands surrounding it, on its huge barrier reef, it forms the Wallis archipelago. Wallis has a fertile volcanic soil and sufficient rainfall to allow subsistence farming.\n\nWallis is subdivided into three districts (north to south):\nSub-equatorial oceanic trade winds make the island hot and humid. The average temperature is around all year round and there is almost never drops below , and in the rainy season is held in the mark .\n\nRainfall is per year, up to in Wallis and Futuna. This rain is likely at least 260 days in a year, and the humidity is 80%. The rainy season lasts from November to April. The same period (November to March), the season of storms, is associated with the passage over the territory of the islands of powerful tropical cyclones. It is followed, in May to October–December, by a cooler and drier season because of the predominance in this period of the southeast trade winds.\n\nArchaeological excavations have identified sites on Wallis dating from circa 1400 AD. It was part of the Tongan maritime empire from around the 13th to 16th century. By that time the influence of the Tui Tonga had declined so much that Uvea became important in itself. Several current, high-ranking Tongan titles, like Halaevalu, trace their descent from Uvea. A legendary large canoe, the Lomipeau, was built on the island as a donation to the Tui Tonga. The big fortress of Talietumu close to Lotoalahi in Mua was the last holdout of the Tongans until they were defeated. The ruins of the place are still a tourist attraction.\n\nThe island was renamed \"Wallis\" after a Cornish navigator, Captain Samuel Wallis, who saw it while sailing aboard on 16 August 1767, following his discovery of Tahiti.\n\nOn 5 April 1842, the authorities of Wallis Island requested protection by France with a protectorate treaty signed in April 1887.\n\nDuring World War II the island's administration was pro-Vichy until a Free French corvette from New Caledonia deposed the regime on 26 May 1942. Units of the US Marine Corps landed on Wallis on 29 May 1942.\n\nAfter a referendum in 1959, Wallis became a French Overseas Territory in 1961.\n\nThe population of the island was 8,333 in 2018 (72% of the territory's population). Most of the inhabitants speak Uvean (or Wallisian) as their mother tongue.\n\nReligion (\"Lotu\") and culture (\"Aga'ifenua\") are very close in Wallis. Everyday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and especially by the Roman Catholic feasts. Each village has its own patron saint. Each district has its great church. The chief cathedral is the Cathedral of Mata-Utu. Almost all the people are Roman Catholic (\"Lotu Katolika\"), and there are numerous religious buildings on the island.\n\nAt their arrival, Catholic missionaries were welcomed by the King Vaimua Lavelua then baptized \"Soane-Patita Vaimua\". Bishop Bataillon developed close relationships with the royal families. As Private Councillor of Queen Amelia, he established in 1847 the Lano Seminary (the first Catholic seminary of Oceania).\n\nLano celebrated 150 years in 1997. The anniversary was attended by Samoan Cardinal Pio Taofinu'u, who studied there in the 1940s, and a big delegation from Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and New-Caledonia.\n\nWallis and Futuna was established as an Apostolic Vicariate on 11 November 1935 and promoted to a Diocese on 21 June 1966.\n\nThe only commercial flights that go to Wallis are operated by the New Caledonia-based Aircalin. There is an Aircalin office in Matāutu in Hahake.\n\nThe island has 12 primary schools, four junior high schools, and one senior high school/sixth-form college.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1956128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956128", "title": "Henry Newton Brown", "text": "Henry Newton Brown\n\nHenry Newton Brown (1857 – April 30, 1884) was an American Old West gunman who played the roles of both lawman and outlaw during his life.\n\nBrown was raised in Cold Springs Township, in Phelps County, ten miles south of Rolla, Missouri. An orphan, he lived there with his uncle Jasper and aunt Aldamira Richardson until the age of seventeen, when he left home and headed west. He drifted through various cowboy jobs in Colorado and Texas, supposedly killing a man in a gunfight in the Texas Panhandle.\n\nIn 1877, Brown landed in the New Mexico Territory, and became embroiled in the Lincoln County War. Brown joined Billy the Kid and cowboys as \"The Regulators\", working John Tunstall's \"Rio Feliz\" Ranch.\n\nOn April 1, 1878, Brown, Billy the Kid, Jim French, Frank McNab, John Middleton and Fred Waite ambushed and murdered Lincoln County Sheriff William Brady, who was indirectly responsible for the death of Tunstall. Three days later, at the Gunfight at Blazer's Mill, Brown and the Regulators engaged in a gunfight with Buckshot Roberts, another man they believed involved in Tunstall's murder. Roberts received a serious gunshot wound from Charlie Bowdre which later proved to be fatal, but not before he managed to kill the Regulators' nominal leader, Richard M. Brewer. Retreating into proprietor Blazer's office, Roberts continued a prolonged firefight with Brown and the Regulators. He died the next day.\n\nThe Lincoln County Regulators — fugitives now for the Brady killing — spent the next several months in hiding. Then on July 15, 1878, they became trapped, along with one of Tunstall's partners, Alexander McSween, in McSween's home in Lincoln by members of \"The House\" and some of Brady's men. Henry Brown was one of three Regulators not actually in McSween's house at the time, but instead was sniping at Brady's men from a grain warehouse behind the Tunstall store. He escaped with Billy the Kid and the others when the siegers set fire to the house. McSween was shot down while fleeing the blaze, and his death essentially marked the end of the Lincoln County Cattle War.\n\nIn the fall of that year, Brown, Billy the Kid, and a few of the remaining Regulators trailed a herd of rustled horses to the little town of Tascosa in the Texas Panhandle. After the horses were sold the Regulators returned to their old haunts, but Brown, named in two murder warrants in the state of New Mexico, wisely remained in Texas where he eventually became a lawman. It has not been established whether he was a deputy sheriff of Oldham County, Texas; Marshal of Tascosa or a constable. He had a quick temper and was quickly dismissed because he \"was always wanting to fight and get his mane up.\"\n\nBrown thereafter drifted through the (Oklahoma) Indian Territory and into Kansas, working on ranches. In July, 1882, when about 25 years old, he settled in Caldwell, Kansas—a rough cattle town comparable to Dodge City and Abilene—where he was first appointed Assistant Marshal of the city; then promoted to marshal about five months later. The Chisholm Trail met the Santa Fe tracks in Caldwell and as the terminus of the trail, it had a long history of violence. Brown, an outlaw turned lawman, and Ben Wheeler, who had been a former Texas lawman turned outlaw, joined forces (with Wheeler as Assistant Marshal) and effectively cleaned up the town.\n\nBrown was described by contemporaries as a \"very much undersize\" man who didn't smoke, drink, chew, or gamble, and was noted to be in regular attendance at the Methodist Church. Said to be \"exceedingly modest and, in fact, bashful,\" he displayed an introvert presence but \"gained the entire confidence of the people . . . and . . . conducted himself in such a manner that the doors of society were always open to him.\"\n\nBut, \"he had a square set jaw, not unlike that of a bull dog\" and \"his face indicated firmness and a lack of physical fear.\" \"His words were few and parted with reluctantly,\" and when duty called, Brown's demeanor changed immediately. He was easily angered: his temper flared instantly and his outwardly meek manner transformed into one of deadly grave purpose. One contemporary commented that \"he was a two-gun man. He could take a six-shooter in each hand and make one think a battle was on.\"\n\nFrom the grateful community, in appreciation for his service, he was given an extensively engraved, gold and silver mounted Winchester rifle. A silver medallion was affixed to the stock inscribed: \n\"Presented to City Marshal\nH. N. Brown\nFor valuable services rendered \nIn behalf of the Citizens of\nCaldwell Kas \nA. N. Colson Mayor Dec 1882\"\n\nBrown killed a gambler, Newt Boyce, with the rifle (in the line of duty) on December 16, 1883. Another killing attributed to Brown in Caldwell was that of Spotted Horse, a renegade Indian.\n\nHenry Brown gained status in the higher realms of Caldwell society when he married Alice Maude Levagood, the daughter of a well-to-do Caldwell brick maker. Alice had a college degree―rare for females of that era.\n\nMarshal Brown and his assistant kept the town clean, and by the time they were appointed to their third term, they were lauded by the citizens as the best and most effective team of lawmen the town had ever had.\n\nIn April, 1884, Brown and Wheeler concocted a story convincing the mayor to give them leave to travel into the Indian Territory to hunt a murderer. With two Cherokee Outlet cowboys, William Smith and John Wesley, they rode to Medicine Lodge, Kansas, and attempted to rob the Medicine Valley Bank. Almost immediately, their attempt fell apart in disaster when gunfire erupted and two of the bank officers were shot. Most conventional accounts name Brown as bank president Wylie Payne's murderer. But T. A. McNeal, author of \"When Kansas Was Young\", sat at his friend Payne's bedside as he lay dying and reports that Payne named Wesley as his killer. Wheeler (and possibly, Wesley) shot George Geppert, the bank's chief cashier who, just before he died, sealed the vault, preventing the robbers from escaping with any money.\n\nBrown and the outlaws fled under fire, pursued by a posse composed of 12 cowboys that happened to be in a stable directly across the street from the bank. The four fugitives, closely pursued by the posse, unwittingly rode into a box canyon several miles south of the town and were eventually forced to surrender. They died a month longer.\n\nLater, incarcerated in the town's small jail, they anticipated a lynch mob, and were offered the opportunity to write letters to their loved ones. Brown did write a poignant letter to his wife. It read in part:\n\"Darling Wife: I am in jail here. Four of us tried to rob the bank here and one man shot one of the men in the bank. I want you to come and see me as soon as you can. I will send you all of my things and you can sell them. But keep the Winchester. It is hard for me to write this letter, but it was all for you, my sweet wife, and for the love I have for you. \"Do not go back on me. If you do it will kill me. Be true to me as long as you live, and come to see me if you think enough of me. My love is just the same as it always was. Oh, how I did hate to leave you last Sunday evening. But I did not think this would happen. I thought we could take in the money and not have any trouble with it, but a man's fondest hopes are sometimes broken with trouble. We would not have been arrested but one of our horses gave out and we could not leave him [the rider] alone. I do not know what to write. Do the best you can with everything. I want you to send me some clothes. Sell all the things you don't need. Have your picture taken and send it to me. Now, my dear wife, go and see Mr. Witzleben and Mr. Nyce and get the money. If a mob does not kill us we will come out all right after while. Maude, I did not shoot anyone and didn't want the others to kill anyone. But they did and that is all there is about it. Now, my darling wife, goodbye. H. N. Brown.\"\n\nRealizing that a lynching was imminent, Wesley removed his boot and with it, the shackle of the leg-iron with which he had been shackled to Brown. Brown tied the loose end of the leg-iron to his leg with his bandana allowing him to run unencumbered. Smith, handcuffed to Wheeler, was able to slip the handcuff over his small hand resulting, unknown to the gathering mob, in all four being free. When the lynch mob came at 9 pm and opened the door, Brown burst through the startled lynch mob to an alley alongside the jail. As he ran past, he was blasted with both barrels of a shotgun at almost point blank range. He died being nearly torn in half. Wheeler ran about 100 yards before being horribly wounded in a barrage of gunfire but lived long enough to hang with Smith and Wesley shortly afterward when the three were hanged on an elm tree by the mob.\n\nIn the film \"Young Guns II\" Henry Brown was combined with fellow Regulator Jim French and presented as a composite named Hendry William French. Timid and clumsy, the film's portrayal of French by actor Alan Ruck bears little actual resemblance to either outlaw.\n\nThe actor William Smith played Brown in the 1969 episode \"The Restless Man\" of the syndicated television series \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Robert Taylor. In the story line, Brown takes the job of sheriff to tame a lawless town, begins to court a young woman, but returns to his deadly outlaw ways in search of thrills.\n\n"}
{"id": "1956137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956137", "title": "Luminous blue variable", "text": "Luminous blue variable\n\nLuminous blue variables (LBVs) are massive evolved stars that show unpredictable and sometimes dramatic variations in both their spectra and brightness. They are also known as S Doradus variables after S Doradus, one of the brightest stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud. They are extraordinarily rare with just 20 objects listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as SDor, and a number of these are no longer considered to be LBVs.\n\nThe LBV stars P Cygni and η Carinae have been known as unusual variables since the 17th century, but their true nature was not fully understood until much more recently.\n\nIn 1922 John Charles Duncan published the first three variable stars ever detected in an external galaxy, variables 1, 2, and 3, in the Triangulum Galaxy (M33). These were followed up by Edwin Hubble with three more in 1926: A, B, and C in M33. Then in 1929 Hubble added a list of variables detected in M31. Of these, Var A, Var B, Var C, and Var 2 in M33 and Var 19 in M31 were followed up with a detailed study by Hubble and Allan Sandage in 1953. Var 1 in M33 was excluded as being too faint and Var 3 had already been classified as a Cepheid variable. At the time they were simply described as irregular variables, although remarkable for being the brightest stars in those galaxies. The original Hubble Sandage paper contains a footnote that S Doradus might be the same type of star, but expressed strong reservations, so the link would have to wait several decades to be confirmed.\n\nLater papers referred to these five stars as Hubble–Sandage variables. In the 1970s, Var 83 in M33 and AE Andromedae, AF Andromedae (=Var 19), Var 15, and Var A-1 in M31 were added to the list and described by several authors as \"luminous blue variables\", although it was not considered a formal name at the time. The spectra were found to contain lines with P Cygni profiles and were compared to η Carinae. In 1978, Roberta M. Humphreys published a study of eight variables in M31 and M33 (excluding Var A) and referred to them as luminous blue variables, as well as making the link to the S Doradus class of variable stars. In 1984 in a presentation at the IAU symposium, Peter Conti formally grouped the S Doradus variables, Hubble–Sandage variables, η Carinae, P Cygni, and other similar stars together under the term \"luminous blue variables\" and shortened it to LBV. He also clearly separated them from those other luminous blue stars, the Wolf–Rayet stars.\n\nVariable star types are usually named after the first member discovered to be variable, for example δ Sct variables named after the star δ Sct. The first luminous blue variable to be identified as a variable star was P Cygni, and these stars have been referred to as P Cygni type variables. The General Catalogue of Variable Stars decided there was a possibility of confusion with P Cygni profiles, which also occur in other types of stars, and chose the acronym SDOR for \"variables of the S Doradus type\". The term \"S Doradus variable\" was used to describe P Cygni, S Doradus, η Carinae, and the Hubble-Sandage variables as a group in 1974.\n\nLBVs are massive unstable supergiant (or hypergiant) stars that show a variety of spectroscopic and photometric variation, most obviously periodic \"outburst\"s and occasional much larger \"eruption\"s.\n\nIn their \"quiescent\" state they are typically B-type stars, occasionally slightly hotter, with unusual emission lines. They are found in a region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram known as the S Doradus instability strip, where the least luminous have a temperature around 10,000 K and a luminosity about 250,000 times the Sun, whereas the most luminous have a temperature around 25,000 K and a luminosity over a million times the Sun, making them some of the most luminous of all stars.\n\nDuring a normal outburst the temperature decreases to around 8,500 K for all stars, slightly hotter than the yellow hypergiants. The bolometric luminosity usually remains constant, which means that visual brightness increases somewhat by a magnitude or two. S Doradus typifies this behaviour. A few examples have been found where luminosity appears to change during an outburst, but the properties of these unusual stars are difficult to determine accurately. For example, AG Carinae may decrease in luminosity by around 30% during outbursts; and AFGL 2298 has been observed to dramatically increase its luminosity during an outburst although it isn't clear if that should be classified as a modest \"giant eruption\". S Doradus typifies this behaviour, which has been referred to as \"strong-active cycle\", and it is regarded as a key criterion for identifying luminous blue variables. Two distinct periodicities are seen, either variations taking longer than 20 years, or less than 10 years. In some cases, the variations are much smaller, less than half a magnitude, with only small temperature reductions. These are referred to as \"weak-active\" cycles and always occur on timescales of less than 10 years.\n\nSome LBVs have been observed to undergo giant eruptions with dramatically increased mass loss and luminosity, so violent that several were initially catalogued as supernovae. The outbursts mean there are usually nebulae around such stars; η Carinae is the best-studied and most luminous known example, but may not be typical. It is generally assumed that all luminous blue variables undergo one or more of these large eruptions, but they have only been observed in two or three well-studied stars and possibly a handful of supernova imposters. The two clear examples in our galaxy, P Cygni and η Carinae, and the possible example in the Small Magellanic Cloud, HD 5980A, have not shown strong-cycle variations. It is still possible that the two types of variability occur in different groups of stars. 3-D simulations have shown that these outbursts may be caused by variations in helium opacity.\n\nMany luminous blue variables also show small amplitude variability with periods less than a year, which appear typical of Alpha Cygni variables, and stochastic (i.e. totally random) variations.\n\nLuminous blue variables are by definition more luminous than most stars and also more massive, but within a very wide range. The most luminous are more than and have masses approaching, possibly exceeding, . The least luminous have luminosities around and masses as low as , although they would have been considerably more massive as main-sequence stars. They all have high mass loss rates and show some enhancement of helium and nitrogen.\n\nBecause of these stars' large mass and high luminosity, their lifetime is very short—only a few million years in total and much less than a million years in the LBV phase. They are rapidly evolving on observable timescales; examples have been detected where stars with Wolf–Rayet spectra (WNL/Ofpe) have developed to show LBV outbursts and a handful of supernovae have been traced to likely LBV progenitors. Recent theoretical research confirms the latter scenario, where luminous blue variable stars are the final evolutionary stage of some massive stars before they explode as supernovae, for at least stars with initial masses between 20 and 25 solar masses. For more-massive stars, computer simulations of their evolution suggest the luminous blue variable phase takes place during the latest phases of core hydrogen burning (LBV with high surface temperature), the hydrogen shell burning phase (LBV with lower surface temperature), and the earliest part of the core helium burning phase (LBV with high surface temperature again) before transitioning to the Wolf–Rayet phase, thus being analogous to the red giant and red supergiant phases of less massive stars.\n\nThere appear to be two groups of LBVs, one with luminosities above 630,000 times the Sun and the other with luminosities below 400,000 times the Sun, although this is disputed in more-recent research. Models have been constructed showing that the lower-luminosity group are post-red-supergiants with initial masses of 30–60 times the Sun, whereas the higher-luminosity group are population-II stars with initial masses 60–90 times the Sun that never develop to red supergiants, although they may become yellow hypergiants. Some models suggest that LBVs are a stage in the evolution of very massive stars required for them to shed excess mass, whereas others require that most of the mass is lost at an earlier cool-supergiant stage. Normal outbursts and the stellar winds in the quiescent state are not sufficient for the required mass loss, but LBVs occasionally produce abnormally large outbursts that can be mistaken for a faint supernova and these may shed the necessary mass. Recent models all agree that the LBV stage occurs after the main-sequence stage and before the hydrogen-depleted Wolf–Rayet stage, and that essentially all LBV stars will eventually explode as supernovae. LBVs apparently can explode directly as a supernova, but probably only a small fraction do. If the star does not lose enough mass before the end of the LBV stage, it may undergo a particularly powerful supernova created by pair-instability. The latest models of stellar evolution suggest that some single stars with initial masses around 20 times that of the Sun will explode as LBVs as type II-P, type IIb, or type Ib supernovae, whereas binary stars undergo much-more-complex evolution through envelope stripping leading to less predictable outcomes.\n\nLuminous blue variable stars can undergo \"giant outbursts\" with dramatically increased mass loss and luminosity. η Carinae is the prototypical example, with P Cygni showing one or more similar outbursts 300–400 years ago, but dozens have now been catalogued in external galaxies. Many of these were initially classified as supernovae but re-examined because of unusual features. The nature of the outbursts and of the progenitor stars seems to be highly variable, with the outbursts most likely having several different causes. The historical η Carinae and P Cygni outbursts, and several seen more recently in external galaxies, have lasted years or decades whereas some of the supernova imposter events have declined to normal brightness within months. Well-studied examples are:\n\nEarly models of stellar evolution had predicted that although the high-mass stars that produce LBVs would often or always end their lives as supernovae, the supernova explosion would not occur at the LBV stage. Prompted by the progenitor of SN 1987A being a blue supergiant, and most likely an LBV, several subsequent supernovae have been associated with LBV progenitors. The progenitor of SN 2005gl has been shown to be an LBV apparently in outburst only a few years earlier. Progenitors of several other type IIn supernovae have been detected and were likely to have been LBVs:\n\nModelling suggests that at near-solar metallicity, stars with an initial mass around will explode as a supernova while in the LBV stage of their lives. They will be post-red-supergiants with luminosities a few hundred thousand times that of the Sun. The supernova is expected to be of type II, most likely type IIb, although possibly type IIn due to episodes of enhanced mass loss that occur as an LBV and in the yellow-hypergiant stage.\n\nThe identification of LBVs requires confirmation of the characteristic spectral and photometric variations, but these stars can be \"quiescent\" for decades or centuries at which time they are indistinguishable from many other hot luminous stars. A candidate luminous blue variable (cLBV) can be identified relatively quickly on the basis of its spectrum or luminosity, and dozens have been catalogued in the Milky Way during recent surveys.\n\nRecent studies of dense clusters and mass spectrographic analysis of luminous stars have identified dozens of probable LBVs in the Milky Way out of a likely total population of just a few hundred, although few have been observed in enough detail to confirm the characteristic types of variability. In addition the majority of the LBVs in the Magellanic Clouds have been identified, several dozen in M31 and M33, plus a handful in other local group galaxies.\nOur galaxy:\n\nLMC:\n\nSMC:\n\nM31:\n\nM33:\nNGC 2403:\n\nNGC 2366 (NGC 2363)\n\nA number of cLBVs in the Milky Way are well known because of their extreme luminosity or unusual characteristics, including:\n\nOther well-known stars not currently classified as LBVs but may be transitioning into LBVs, have been LBVs relatively recently, or are LBVs in a stable phase include:\n\n\n"}

It was first filmed during a U.S. Air Force aerial reconnaissance mission in 1949 — the Ararat massif sits on the former Turkish/Soviet border, and was thus an area of military interest — and was accordingly given a classification of \"secret\" as were subsequent photographs taken in 1956, 1973, 1976, 1990 and 1992, by aircraft and satellites.\n\nSix frames from the 1949 footage were released under the Freedom of Information Act to Porcher Taylor, a professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, and a scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies specializing in satellite intelligence and diplomacy, in 1995.\n\nA joint research project was later established between \"Insight Magazine\" and Space Imaging (now GeoEye), using the IKONOS satellite. IKONOS captured the anomaly on August 5 and September 13, 2000. GeoEye has constructed a computerized video of the imagery it captured of the anomaly. The structure appears at approximately halfway through the video. A controversial \"bird's eye view\" satellite image, taken by IKONOS later in 2003 for the same research project, was released to the public in 2006.\nThe Mount Ararat area also has been imaged by France's SPOT satellite in September 1989, Landsat in the 1970s and NASA's Space shuttle in 1994, as well as military satellite images captured by the CIA's KH-9 (Keyhole 9) in 1973 and KH-11 (Keyhole 11) in 1976 and 1990–1992.\n\nThe Defense Intelligence Agency believes the anomaly shows \"linear facades in the glacial ice underlying more recently accumulated ice and snow.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1956141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1956141", "title": "Designated marksman rifle", "text": "Designated marksman rifle\n\nA designated marksman rifle (DMR) is the scoped high-precision weapon system used by modern infantries in the designated marksman (DM) role. Although the \"sniper\" and the \"designated marksman\" are distinguished by mission and deployment role, rather than by operational range, the DM's role generally fills the engagement range gap from , between a regular infantryman and a dedicated sniper. DMRs are developed to fulfil this middle ground tactical role.\n\nDMRs, unlike the often bolt-action sniper rifles, are almost always semi-automatic rifles as these have higher rates of fire than bolt-action rifles, and typically have larger magazine capacities (10, 20, or 30 rounds depending on the firearm and operational requirements) to allow rapid engagement of multiple targets. These rifles have to be effective, in terms of hit rates and terminal ballistics, at ranges exceeding those of ordinary assault rifles and battle rifles, but do not require the extended-range performance of a dedicated sniper rifle. DMRs often share some basic characteristics with sniper rifles when compared to the weapons carried by others in the DM's platoon. DMRs may have an attached telescopic sight, quickly deployed stabilizing bipod to allow optimized accuracy and low-recoil in temporarily fixed situations or an adjustable stock. The designated marksman's rifle needs to function as part of squad (and possibly at close quarters).\n\nMost designated marksman rifles are based on an assault rifle that is currently issued by a nation's military, or on a battle rifle that was formerly issued. A battle rifle is a semi-automatic or full-automatic rifle that fires 7.62 mm NATO or similar full-power rounds. Classic examples include the M14, FN FAL, AR-10 and Heckler & Koch G3. These rifles were largely replaced by assault rifles firing the 5.56 mm NATO cartridge during the 1980s and 1990s, but many were accurized and retained as DMRs.\n\nConversely, some nations have also built rifles that were designed for the designated marksman from the ground up. Examples include the Soviet SVD and Chinese QBU-88.\n\nSome designated marksman rifles will have some type of optical sight with a higher magnification level than the standard issue rifle. For example, the SDM-R issued to the United States Army is fitted with a Trijicon 4× ACOG, while the standard-issue M4 carbine is equipped with an unmagnified Aimpoint CompM2 or CompM4. Commonly, the sighting system will be the only difference between the standard rifle and the designated marksman rifle, as is the case with the F88S DMR issued to the Australian Army.\n\nSniper rifles often have even greater magnification than designated marksman rifles outfitted with magnification, for example, the M110 SASS used by the United States Army, is equipped with a Leupold 3.5-10× variable-power scope. However, some designated marksman rifles, such as the Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle or the USMC Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle are fitted with scopes with similar magnification.\n\nIn some cases, the designated marksman rifle will have a longer barrel than the standard issued rifle, however, this is not universally true. For example, until October 2015, when the M4 carbine was approved as the new standard issue rifle, the M16A4 rifle was still standard issue throughout the United States Marine Corps. The barrel on the Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle, the current rifle used by the squad designated marksman in the USMC, is only 500 mm (18 in) long - 50 mm (2 in) shorter than the barrel on the standard rifle. This no longer the case, however, as the M4 carbine has a barrel length of only 370 mm (14.5 in). Also, some rifles, such as the F88S Austeyr, have a barrel that is the same length as the standard service rifle. The FD-200 has an accurized barrel, also found on designated marksman rifles.\n\nMost sniper rifles, such as the Accuracy International Arctic Warfare have a barrel with a length of 610 mm (24 in) or greater. Only the SVD and similar designated marksman rifles have a barrel of this length. The designated marksman rifles based on the M14 have barrels 460-560 mm (18-22 in) long.\n\nIn most cases, a designated marksman rifle will share the caliber and possibly even the ammunition type used by standard issue rifles. DM rifles may be issued with standard ball ammunition, or special match-grade loads, such as 7.62 mm NATO 'M118LR' sniper round. Sniper rifles are (almost exclusively) deployed with match grade ammunition in order to take advantage of their full effective range and accuracy potential.\n\nIn the U.S. military, designated marksman rifles chambered for 5.56 mm NATO have available the 5 g (77 grain) match-grade Mk 262 Mod 0/1 cartridge that enhances the effective range to roughly .\n\nAll designated marksman rifles in use today are semi-automatic, some are select fire. Sniper rifles are generally bolt action rifles, but can also be semi-automatic.\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Rifles]]\n[[Category:Designated marksman rifles| ]]\n[[Category:Personal weapons]]"}

Others are simply privately run zoos devoted to solely to reptiles or are incorporated into larger zoos or organizations.\n\nOne example is the reptile centre in Alice Springs, Australia, devoted to indigenous reptiles. Many are collected from local homes, yards, or from areas about to be burned under the controlled burning program to keep summer grass fires from threatening the local homes.

The venue is currently used mostly for athletics, music events and other (sport)events.\n\nWhen completed, the stadium had a capacity of 31,600. Following the completion of the rival De Kuip stadium in Rotterdam in 1937, the Amsterdam authorities increased the capacity of the Olympic Stadium to 64,000 by adding a second ring to the stadium. In 1987 the stadium was listed as a national monument.\n\nAFC Ajax used the Olympic Stadium for international games until 1996, when the Amsterdam Arena, since 2018 named Johan Cruyff Arena, was completed. Renovation started in 1996, and the stadium was refurbished into the original construction of 1928. The second ring of 1937 was removed, reducing capacity to 22,288, and the stadium was made suitable for track and field competitions again.\n\nSince 2005, the stadium is home to a sports museum, the Olympic Experience Amsterdam.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium was designed by architect Jan Wils, and is one of the finest examples of Amsterdamse School architecture, complementing the surrounding neighbourhood designed by H.P. Berlage. The design won the Olympic gold medal in the architecture competition at the 1928 Olympics. The concrete second ring that was added in 1937 to the north and south wing of the stadium was also designed by Jan Wils.\n\nThe original plan of Jan Wils consisted of an extension of the Harry Elte stadium that was situated next to the current Olympic Stadium. This plan was rejected as the municipal government of Amsterdam had planned an important urban development programme in that area, and wanted to demolish the stadium as soon as possible. The second plan was almost fully executed, and consisted of a new Olympic Stadium that was situated more westward. In January 1926, the Amsterdam municipal government, the National Olympic Committee and the NV Nederlandsch Sportpark—the owner of the Harry Elte stadium—reached an agreement; after the Olympic Games of 1928, the Harry Elte stadium would be demolished and the NV Nederlandsch Sportpark would be the owner of the Olympic Stadium. Starting in January 1926, the area in which the stadium was to be built was elevated by means of 750,000 cubic metres of sand. This phase was completed in October of that year and in the same month the construction of the pile foundation began. On 18 May 1927, the ceremonial first stone was placed by Prince Hendrik. Some two million stones would follow.\n\nThe football pitch measures 114 by 75 metres. The athletics track around it is eight metres wide and has a perimeter of 400 metres. The cycle track around the athletics track was nine metres wide had a perimeter of 500 metres. It also hosted the equestrian jumping, field hockey, gymnastics and korfball (demonstration) events.\n\nThe capacity of the stadium is subject to controversy as the exact capacity was kept secret to press and public during the Games to evade the remark that the stadium's capacity was only marginally bigger than the Harry Elte stadium. It is said that two configurations could be set up in the stadium; one with 21,537 seats and 12,618 standing rooms (33,255 total) and one with 16,197 seats and 25,236 standing rooms (41,433 total). After the Games the NOC admitted that the capacity of the stadium was somewhere near 31,600. Additional seats could be added on the cycle track, which would increase the capacity with 5,900.\n\nThe 1928 Olympics introduced the idea of the Olympic Flame. The flame burned for the first time ever in a tall tower, known as the Marathon tower, adjacent to the Olympic Stadium. In the top of the Marathon tower, four balconies are situated which were used during the Games by horn blowers. Above these balconies four speakers from Philips were attached, from which results and messages were broadcast into the Olympic area, a novelty at the time. The bowl on top which carried the Olympic flame was known to Amsterdammers as \"the ashtray of KLM pilots\". A permanent Olympic flame burning during the tournament was also an Olympic first.\n\nIn 1987 the city government announced plans to demolish the stadium. The stadium was saved, however, when it was listed as a national monument. Renovation started in 1996, and the stadium was refurbished into the original construction of 1928. The second ring of 1937 was removed, and the stadium was made suitable for track and field competitions again. The original bicycle track was also removed to enable the use of the space beneath the seats for offices. The stadium was reopened by the Prince of Orange on 13 May 2000.\n\nIn 2007, the area around the stadium was renovated as part of larger urban renewal project covering the entire Olympic area. North of the stadium 969 houses were completed in 2008. In the same year, the islands in the river Schinkel to the west of the stadium were suited with tennis fields and football pitches, an athletics track and a park. The Stadionplein square in front of the stadium is also to be renovated, which is expected to begin in 2010.\n\nTwo new bridges were also built around the stadium: to the south there is a new bridge suitable for all traffic, the Na Druk Gelukbrug, and to the Schinkel islands in the west there is a cyclists and pedestrian bridge, called Jan Wilsbrug.\n\nThe stadium hosted several international matches of the Dutch national football team, the first one being the game against Uruguay (0–2) during the Summer Olympics on 30 May 1928. The last one was a friendly on 6 September 1989 against Denmark (2–2).\n\nAfter the Olympics, the stadium was used regularly for various sporting events, including athletics, speedway, field hockey and cycling. The 1954 Tour de France, for example, started outside the stadium. However, it was football that remained the most popular. It was both the home ground of Blauw Wit and BVC Amsterdam (later merged into FC Amsterdam), while AFC Ajax used the stadium for games in which the crowd was expected to exceed the capacity of its own De Meer Stadion (in practice, most of their international matches) or for midweek games which required the use of floodlights, with which the De Meer was not initially suited. Ajax continued this arrangement until the completion of the Amsterdam Arena in 1996, since 2018 renamed the Johan Cruijff Arena.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium was the host venue for the 1987 FIM Speedway World Championship Final. The event, held for the first and only time over two days (thus consisting of two separate meetings with the riders aggregate score determining their placing), was won by defending World Champion Hans Nielsen from Denmark. Second was fellow Dane and former twice (1984 and 1985) World Champion Erik Gundersen, while finishing third was American rider Sam Ermolenko (himself a future World Champion in 1993). The speedway track was laid out over the stadiums existing athletics track. The only Dutchman in the field Henny Kroeze (who had been seeded to the Final so as to have at least one Dutch rider in the field), finished 16th and last in the Final after scoring only one point over the two days with the point coming in his 5th and final ride of the first day.\n\nThe Amsterdam Admirals played their inaugural season in the World League of American Football in 1995, and the 1996 season, at the stadium, prior to moving to the Amsterdam ArenA. The stadium hosted World Bowl '95.\n\nThe stadium hosted the 2016 European Athletics Championships. Because of this, an athletics track was added to the plan for the nearby Park Schinkeleilanden at the last moment. The athletics track in that nearby park, which could be a warming up track when using the main track in the Olympic Stadium for racing, was opened in 2008. The stadium also serves as the start and finish of the Amsterdam Marathon, held every October.\n\nIn 2014, the stadium was temporarily fitted with a long track speedskating rink, and hosted the Dutch national championships in Allround and Sprint. This was repeated in 2018 to host the World Allround Championships.[https://www.parool.nl/stadsgids/olympisch-stadion-wordt-weer-omgetoverd-tot-schaatsbaan~a4533323/ ]\n\nThe stadium is also a tourist attraction.

The practice is described in the novels and poetry of Sir Walter Scott. A small burning cross or charred piece of wood would be carried from town to town. A widely known use was in the 1715 Jacobite rising, although it was used more recently among Scottish settlers in Canada during the War of 1812. In 1820, over 800 fighting men of the Scottish Clan Grant were gathered, by the passing of the Fiery Cross, to come to the aid of their Clan Chief and his sister in the town of Elgin.\n\nThe name \"Crann Tara\" was used for a Scottish Gaelic current affairs programme on Grampian Television (ITV).\n\nWhen an enemy had arrived, bidding sticks (Old Swedish: \"buþkafle\" (sg.)) were sent in all directions. In Sweden, they consisted of clubs, or just wooden chunks; in Norway, there were repurposed arrows. Sometimes the bidding sticks had a string attached to one end and were charred on the other end; Olaus Magnus (1555) relates that those who did not bring the club to the next village would be hanged and their homesteads burnt down.\n\nWhen the people were assembled to a thing, the object was in the shape of an axe, or if the meeting concerned blasphemy, it was a cross.\n\nThe objects were signed with runes or other marks in order to indicate the reason for the assembly (e.g. election of king at the Stone of Mora), and who had sent them. During the Middle Ages, using \"buþkaflar\" was the official method of assembling people, and they were only allowed to be carved by certain officials, e.g. governors and sheriffs.\n\nThey were especially efficient, however, when they were used to levy people against royal oppression and high taxes. After the Dalecarlian rebellion of 1743, strong checks were placed on the use of bidding sticks.\n\nIn Sweden, the bidding stick was standardized during the village reorganizations in 1742, and it was at the village level that they were frequently used. During the 19th and 20th centuries, more specific messages were attached to the clubs or inserted into a hollow space. Still in the early 20th century, there was a paragraph in Swedish law that stated that the bidding stick would be sent between the villages if there was a forest fire. — Similar paragraphs were also present in the Finnish legislation concerning the correct use of \"arpakapula\", or \"budkavle\" in Finland’s Swedish, till the 20th century.\n\nThe concept of the bidding stick has been used as the name for several newspapers, including the Norwegian papers \"Budstikka\", \"Budstikken\", and \"Bremanger Budstikke\", and the Faroese paper \"Tingakrossur\".\n"}

Most notably, jazz pianist Brad Mehldau recorded covers of \"Exit Music (For a Film),\" \"Everything in Its Right Place\" and \"Paranoid Android.\" Perhaps the most interesting part of O'Riley's album is his selection of Radiohead songs: he has chosen a broad view of the band's music, including tracks from earlier work (\"Black Star,\" \"Fake Plastic Trees,\" \"Bulletproof\") as well as more conceptual work, such as \"Airbag,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\" and \"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\"\n\n\"True Love Waits\" was followed in 2005 by O'Riley's second Radiohead tribute album, \"Hold Me to This\".\n\nAll songs by Radiohead (Colin Greenwood, Jonny Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, Phil Selway, and Thom Yorke), arrangements by Christopher O'Riley. \n"}
