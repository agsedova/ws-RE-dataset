It is one of the most notable pieces of Art Nouveau architecture in former Galicia. The station was opened to the public in 1904, and celebrated its centennial anniversary on 26 March 2004. On a monthly basis, the terminal handles over 1.2 million passengers and moves 16 thousand tons of freight.\n\nConstruction of an extensive net of railways within the Austro-Hungarian Empire allowed the city of Lemberg (its German name at the time) to retain its nodal position at the crossing of several notable trade routes. As the capital of Galicia, the city needed a new, representative and large railway station that would suit the city needs and replace the old neo-Gothic railway station built between 1861 and 1862 with the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis.\n\nIn 1888 the Polish architect and a graduate of the Lwów Technical Academy Władysław Sadłowski was selected to design a new station. The final project, prepared in less than a year, encompassed a large, horizontally-oriented main hall, with two large train yards located in the background. The main entrance was topped with a large dome made of bolted steel and stained glass. Both wings of the symmetrical building were constituted by two pavilions, each with a smaller cupola.\n\nThe main entrance was flanked by a set of Tuscan columns and large mythological sculptures, with the one representing Hypnos being the most notable. Since Sadłowski was the main representative of the William Morris' Arts and Crafts movement in Poland, his project included not only the architectural part of the future building, but also the ornaments and decorations. The project of three waiting halls (one for each class of travellers) was prepared in cooperation with another graduate of Sadłowski's \"alma mater\", Alfred Zachariewicz.\n\nThe first class waiting hall was modelled after the style of an English gentleman's club, and was equipped with dark, luxurious Viennese-style furniture, resembling the works of the Wiener Werkstätte. The second class waiting room was modelled after 19th century burgher houses in Galicia, while the third class waiting hall was equipped with simple wooden pieces of furniture, modelled after the Zakopane style of Polish Gorals made by the artist Tadeusz Obmiński.\n\nThe ornaments featured in the tunnels leading to the platforms and in the platforms themselves were prepared by the Kraków-based company of Józef Górecki. Made of bent steel, the balustrades and railings bore direct resemblance to the style of the Paris Métro ornaments designed by Hector Guimard. A design for the registers was constructed in Zieleniewski Maschinen und Wagonbau-Gesellschaft Werk Sanok, (Autosan).\n\nConstruction started in 1899 and lasted until 1904, when the railway station was opened to the public. It was visited by some of the most renowned architects of the epoch, and influenced the later construction of the train stations in Prague (Josef Franta, 1909) and Vienna (Otto Wagner).\n\nDuring World War II, when the city was under the rule of the Soviet Union, the occupied eastern Poland railways were integrated into the Soviet Railway system. The station suffered extensive damage during the war, including a completely destroyed trainshed. There was an open debate on whether to restore the building or to dismantle the ruins and build anew. Architect G.F. Domashenko managed to bring both parties to agreement, and between 1949 and 1953 the old structure was given a contemporary Stalinist interior, whilst a full repair on the outside preserved its original view. Frequent renovations and upgrades ensured that the service and building was always up to modern standards, a tradition which Ukraine continued through the 1990s and into the 21st century, with the most recent major restoration being carried out in 2003.\n\n\n"}

His most public role was as the chief executive officer of Australia's largest telecommunications company Telstra from 1999 to 2004. During his tenure, he oversaw the privatisation of the then government-owned corporation through a series of public tranche sales (known as the \"T1\", \"T2\" and \"T3\" sales). Currently, he is the chairman of both NBN Co and Suncorp, a director of Healthscope, Oil Search and Tabcorp and the Chancellor of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University).\n\nSwitkowski was born in Germany in 1948 to Polish parents. His family migrated to Australia when he was one year old and settled in Melbourne. He attended St Bernard's College in Essendon (a suburb of Melbourne), and earned a bachelor's degree in science and a doctorate in nuclear physics (at 24 years old) from the University of Melbourne. He then completed six years of postdoctoral research and the six-week Advanced Management Program of the Harvard Business School in 1993.\n\nBefore his tenure at Telstra, Switkowski was chief executive officer of Australia's second largest telecommunications company Optus and the photographic equipment company Kodak (Australasia). He also served as chairman and managing director of Kodak (Australasia) from 1992 to 1996. During this time, he served as a non-executive director of the multinational packaging company Amcor from 1995 to 1999.\n\nIn 1995, Switkowski received the Advance Australia Award for outstanding achievement in industry and commerce.\n\nOn 1 March 1999, Switkowski was appointed chief executive officer of Australia's public and largest telecommunications company Telstra, and to the board of directors of Telstra's pay television partner Foxtel. Before his appointment, he was group managing director of Telstra's Business and International Development division.\n\nDuring his tenure at Telstra, Switkowski oversaw the introduction of a number of services to the company; such as its major internet service provider subsidiary BigPond, and substantial expansion of others; such as its advertising and directories subsidiary Pacific Access (later re-branded as Sensis in 2002).\n\nSwitkowski oversaw the implementation of the second tranche sale of Telstra (the 'T2' sale) on the Australian Stock Exchange, New Zealand Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange that began in September 1999. The first tranche sale of Telstra (the 'T1' sale) took place before Switkowski was appointed CEO of Telstra. He also oversaw the planning for the third tranche sale of Telstra (the 'T3' sale).\n\nSwitkowski resigned from Telstra on 3 December 2004, and was replaced by Solomon Trujillo.\n\nOn 3 October 2013, Switkowski was confirmed as the new chairman and interim CEO of NBN Co by Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and reverted to the role of Non-Executive Chairman from 2 April 2014 following the appointment of Bill Morrow as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn 6 June 2006, Switkowski was appointed to chair a Commonwealth Government inquiry into the viability of a domestic nuclear power industry. He was later appointed chairman of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) by federal Minister for Science Julie Bishop on 4 March 2007. Switkowski was originally appointed to the board of ANSTO on 1 January 2006, but stood down when appointed to the inquiry. After the completion of the inquiry, he was then reappointed to the board as chairman on 1 March 2007. His term as chairman concluded at the end of 2010.\n\nThe inquiry concluded that Australia is well positioned to increase its production and export of uranium as well as adding nuclear power to its own energy mix. However, an independent panel of Australian scientists and nuclear experts have been critical of these findings, claiming that they relied upon flawed assumptions while dodging important questions such as the disposal of radioactive waste and the potential greenhouse gas implications of increased mining.\n\nOn 19 September 2005, Switkowski took a non-executive director role with Suncorp-Metway – his first position after resigning from Telstra. Since then he has become the chairman as of the 2011 Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn 2006, Switkowski was appointed president of the board of directors of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image on 1 January – for a three-year term. He also took non-executive director roles with Healthscope on 19 January, and with Tabcorp Holdings on 2 October.\n\nIn 2011 Switkowski was serving as a director of Rare Earth's miner Lynas Corporation as per the director's Share Purchase Notice.\n\nSwitkowski also currently serves as chairman of Opera Australia and on the board of directors of the Business Council of Australia.\n\nSwitkowski currently serves on the Board of Oilsearch.\n\nOn 27 October 2010, it was announced that Switkowski would become the Chancellor of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University). He was officially appointed to the position on 1 January 2011.\n\nIn the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours List, Switkowski was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), for \"distinguished service to the community, particularly to tertiary education administration, scientific organisations and the telecommunications sector, to business, and to the arts\".\n\nSwitkowski is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors (FAICD) and also of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (FTSE). In 2015 he was elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA).\n\nSwitkowski is married and lives with his wife near Cape Schanck, on Melbourne's Mornington Peninsula.\n\n"}
{"id": "1914123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914123", "title": "Adelospondyli", "text": "Adelospondyli\n\nAdelospondyli is an order of elongated, presumably aquatic, Carboniferous amphibians (\"sensu lato\"). They have a robust skull roofed with solid bone, and orbits located towards the front of the skull. The limbs were almost certainly absent, although some historical sources reported them to be present. Despite the likely absence of limbs, adelospondyls retained a large part of the bony shoulder girdle. Adelospondyls have been assigned to a variety of groups in the past. They have traditionally been seen as members of the subclass Lepospondyli, related to other unusual early tetrapods such as \"microsaurs\", \"nectrideans\", and aïstopods. Analyses such as Ruta & Coates (2007) have offered an alternate classification scheme, arguing that adelospondyls were actually far removed from other lepospondyls, instead being stem-tetrapod stegocephalians closely related to the family Colosteidae.\n\nMost adelospondyls belong to the family Adelogyrinidae, and prior to 2003 the order and family were considered synonymous. In 2003, Ruta \"et al\". assigned \"Acherontiscus\" to the order as the only known non-adelogyrinid member. Members of this group are very rare; only six known specimens can be assigned to the five known genera with absolute confidence. These specimens are known from Mississippian (Serpukhovian Age) geological deposits in Scotland, and they were among the oldest \"lepospondyls\" known from fossils.\n\nAdelospondyls share a variety of traits with other lepospondyls, although whether these traits are an example of convergent evolution is a controversial topic. Like the aïstopods and lysorophian \"microsaurs\", they had very elongated bodies similar to that of snakes and eels. In addition, they lacked limbs (similarly to the aïstopods), although forelimbs were supposedly found in various adelogyrinids in the late 1960s. Andrews & Carroll (1991) found that all cases of forelimb bones in adelogyrinids were actually misinterpretations. For example, putative forelimbs discovered in \"Adelogyrinus\" and \"Palaeomolgophis\" by Brough & Brough (1967) were re-identified as hyoid bones and ribs, respectively. Carroll (1967) also claimed that forelimbs were present in \"Adelospondylus\", but these later considered to be hyoids as in \"Adelogyrinus\".\n\nAdelospondyls had somewhat long and low skulls, with large orbits (eye sockets) shifted towards the front of the skull. As a result, the proportions of the skull bones were affected. For example, the nasal bones along the midline of the skull in front of the eyes were much shorter than the frontal bones directly behind them, which extended forwards past the level of the eyes. The frontal bones were omitted from the edge of the orbits (eye holes) due to a contact between the pre- and post-frontals which typically lie in front of and behind the orbits, respectively. Unlike lysorophians and aïstopods, which had snake-like skulls with large openings and reduced bone material, adelospondyl skulls were strongly built and covered with ridges, pits, and grooves, including lateral line sulci. They typically possessed many teeth, although such teeth differ in structure between families. Adelogyrinids, for example, had many numerous \"chisel-shaped\" teeth, while \"Acherontiscus\" had blunt teeth at the back of the mouth and sharp, thin teeth at the front. As is the case in other lepospondyls, the teeth of adelospondyls did not have a maze-like internal structure like those of \"labyrinthodonts\", nor did adelospondyls possess enlarged fang-like teeth on the roof of the mouth.\n\nSimilar to various other lepospondyls, adelospondyls lost several bones in the temporal region of the skull, which is at the back of the skull between the quadratojugal bone of the jaw joint and the parietal and postparietal bones at the midline of the skull roof. Stem- and crown-tetrapods typically have three to four bones on each side of the skull in this region (from top to bottom): the tabular, supratemporal (and sometimes an adjacent intertemporal), and squamosal. The intertemporal is lost (or fused into other bones) in a variety of unrelated tetrapod groups. The same process additionally occurs to the supratemporal in several lepospondyls, namely \"microsaurs\" and a few \"nectrideans\" such as \"Scincosaurus\" and diplocaulids. Adelospondyls take this one step further. They possess only a single bone between the jaw joint and the skull roof. This bone is often believed to be a fusion between the tabular and the squamosal (termed a \"tabular-squamosal\" or \"squamosotabular\"), although it is also conceivable that the tabular disappeared completely leaving only the enlarged squamosal in its place.\n\nAdelospondyls can also be characterized by their vertebrae compared to other lepospondyls. They were spool-shaped and high in number, with \"Acherontiscus\" having an estimated 64 vertebrae and an indeterminate juvenile adelogyrinid having at least 70. Most of these vertebrae lack haemal spines, indicating that the primary elongation took place in the body rather than the tail. The neural spines are not fused to the centra, a characteristic which D.M.S. Watson (1929) used to characterize the adelospondyls as a distinct order. In fact, the name \"adelospondyl\" is Greek for \"obscure vertebra\", referencing both the rarity of adelospondyls and this trait. However, Watson also included \"Lysorophus\" as an adelospondyl rather than a lysorophian \"microsaur\", and other studies have shown that the absence of neurocentral fusion is very common among tetrapods, and therefore useless as a distinguishing feature. However, adelospondyls do have an additional quality of the vertebrae which is unique compared to other lepospondyls. In most lepospondyls, the left and right halves of each vertebra's neural arch are separate, rather than fused as in other tetrapods. Adelospondyls retain the primitive condition of the two halves being completely fused, making their vertebrae unique among lepospondyls. \"Acherontiscus\" deviates from the norm of the subclass even more than other adelospondyls, as it possessed two separate bony components of the centra, rather than a single centrum (which is the case in adelogyrinids and other lepospondyls). These two different components (the intercentrum at the front and pleurocentrum at the back) were nearly equal in size, similar to the vertebrae of embolomeres.\n\nAlthough adelospondyls lost all trace of their fore- and hind-limbs, they did retain a notable remnant of their presumably limbed ancestors. This remnant is a large bony dermal shoulder girdle, comprising the plate-like interclavicle which was positioned on the midline of the chest, two clavicle bones on either side of it, and two boomerang-shaped cleithrum bones at the base of the neck. On the other hand, the bones of the endochondral shoulder girdle (i.e. the scapulae and coracoids), which supported the forelimbs, were lost along with the limbs. Adelospondyls possessed a large bony hyoid apparatus, including gill-supporting bones such as hypobranchials and ceratobranchials. Long, thin scales have been preserved in most adelospondyl specimens, and they were more abundant on the ventral (belly) side of the body rather than the dorsal (back) side.\n\n\n"}

The park is owned and operated by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment and has an annual attendance of just over 4.1 million a year, making it the second most visited among all SeaWorld-owned parks behind SeaWorld Orlando, and eleventh overall among the 20 most visited amusement parks in North America.\n\nThe park has been home to many notable roller coasters and thrill rides, including SheiKra, the first Dive Coaster in North America and at the time of opening, was the longest, tallest and fastest in the world; Tigris, the tallest launch coaster in Florida; Montu, which was the tallest and fastest inverted roller coaster in the world at the time of opening; Falcon's Fury, the tallest free-standing drop tower in North America; and the upcoming Iron Gwazi, a hybrid roller coaster which is expected to become the tallest in North America as well as the fastest and steepest in the world when it opens.\n\nBusch Gardens Tampa opened on March 31, 1959 as an admission-free hospitality facility which provided guests with the opportunity to taste the beer. In addition to various beer tastings, they had a bird garden and the \"Stairway to the Stars\", which was an escalator that took guests to the roof of the brewery where the tour began.\n\nOver time, as popularity in Busch Gardens grew so did the company. Just as it is today, the birds roamed free, where the guests were free to pet them.  Millions visited, and in a stroke of brilliance wildlife-lover, August A. Busch Jr. added the 29-acre Serengeti Plains in 1965, which eventually expanded to 70 acres. The gigantic Serengeti Plain allowed the African wildlife to roam freely and became the largest, free-roaming habitat outside of Africa. It remains one of the most unique features of the park to this day and has received numerous upgrades and expansions. Busch Gardens continued to focus on its tropical landscape, exotic animals and amusements to draw visitors.\n\nBusch Gardens began charging admission as the entertainment became more complex, with extra fees for the thrill rides, such as the roller coasters for which Busch Gardens is now known for. The very popular \"Sesame Street\" kid area was once \"The Land of the Dragons\" area, the second kid-friendly area introduced in the park. The first roller coaster introduced the park was the \"Python\", which sparked more and more business. From then on came Scorpion, Kumba, Montu, Sand Serpent, etc. As of recently, Busch Gardens opened its newest roller coaster in April 2019 called \"Tigris,\" which is labeled as a \"Skyrocket.\" Tigris is said to be the tallest launch roller coaster in Florida, thus giving Busch Gardens more attention. An upcoming attraction that is under construction, is called Iron Gwazi, which is to be finished by Spring 2020. They announced that it is a hybrid wooden-steel roller coaster, and is located where \"Gwazi\" once stood. It is said to be the world's fastest and steepest hybrid roller coaster.\n\nNot only do the roller coasters bring in loads of visitors, but with the introduction of events, such as the famous \"Howl-O-Scream\", \"Christmas Town\", and \"Food and Wine Festival\", it drew even more attention to the park.\n\n\nThe park's main entrance. Treats can be purchased at the Sultan's Sweets and the Zagora Cafe. The Moroccan Palace is located here, as well as the outdoor Marrakesh Theater. Gwazi was the major ride in this area and a new hybrid roller coaster ride (Iron Gwazi) will take its place.\n\n\nFormer \"Land of the Dragons\" children's section of the park. Land of the Dragons, which itself replaced the Dwarf Village in 1995, was replaced by Sesame Street Safari of Fun on March 27, 2010. It contains all the attractions from Land of the Dragons which are now re-themed. It also contains four new attractions.\nThis section of the park is home to one of the park's water rides, Stanley Falls Flume. It is also home to launch coaster Tigris, and SheiKra, which was the first and only Dive Coaster in the United States until the addition of Griffon at the sister park Busch Gardens Williamsburg. The section opened up in 1973 with the addition of the Stanley Falls Flume. The African Queen Boat Ride opened in 1977 as Busch's version of Disney's Jungle Cruise. The African Queen featured live animals, including alligators, crocodiles, rhinoceroses and spider monkeys. A colorful South American macaw rode on each boat as a first mate. There was also a cast member, dressed in African warrior regalia, who surprised each boat as it passed through a riverside village. The warrior was featured in television ads for the park in the early 1980s. In 1989, the African Queen Boat Ride was transformed into Tanganyika Tidal Wave with the addition of a drop that generates a giant splash. The section remained unchanged until 2005 when SheiKra opened and the surrounding area was renovated.\n\n\nThis section, themed to the jungles of Congo, contains two of the park's most popular rides, Kumba and Congo River Rapids. In November 2006, Congo underwent a major renovation, including the removal of the park's classic Python corkscrew roller coaster. Other former Congo attractions include the Swinging Vines, family swing flat ride closing in the early 1990s and the Monstrous Mamba octopus flat ride closing in the late 1990s. And the Pygmy Village kids area featuring three children's rides, a teacup ride, a kiddie swing ride relocated to Sesame Street Safari of Fun and the Gwazi Gliders moved to Morocco.\n\n\nOpened on April 5, 2008, Jungala is a family attraction featuring up-close animal encounters, rope bridges to explore three stories of jungle life, and a water-play area for children. Also located in this area are two family attractions: Jungle Flyers, a zip line that offers three different flight patterns above the treetops of the new area, and Wild Surge, a shot tower that launches guests above a waterfall. Another attraction is Tiger Trail, which is a walkthrough with tigers where there is also a glass turret where you can look out right in the middle of the tiger enclosure. During the Kareebu Jungala atmosphere show, stiltwalkers perform with puppets and interact with guests in the heart of Jungala.\n\nA section originally themed after the malls and bazaars of Africa that opened up in May 1980 as \"Timbuktu\". The Phoenix was built in 1984 and remains a popular ride to this day. The section was renovated in 2003. Important elements added during this facelift included the enclosing of the Timbuktu Theater, which replaced the park's Dolphin Theater with an indoor 4-D movie theater. The dolphins retired to other locations. The 4-D theater premiered with \"R.L Stine's Haunted Lighthouse\" film in 2003, followed by \"Pirates 4D\" in 2006 and \"Sesame Street Presents: Lights! Camera! Imagination!\" in 2010. In 2004, Das Festhaus was transformed into the Desert Grill, and the park's family-friendly Sand Serpent wild mouse roller coaster opened, replacing the Crazy Camel Trabant flat ride. In September 2014, Falcon's Fury, a 335-foot drop tower, opened, replacing the former Sandstorm orbiter flat ride. This section of the park was re-themed to \"Pantopia\" alongside the opening of Falcon's Fury.\n\n\nAlligators and crocodiles can be observed here up close. In Curiosity Cavern, guests can view mammal and reptile exhibits. Visitors to Nairobi can meet the Animal Ambassadors who travel the country and make educational appearances at Jambo Junction. The area also contains Myombe Reserve, a tropical rainforest that is home to Western lowland gorillas and common chimpanzees. In 2012 the Animal Care Center opened, allowing guests to observe actual veterinary procedures, as well as meet the stars of \"Wildlife Docs\", Busch Gardens' Saturday morning television show. The main train station at Busch Gardens is located at Nairobi. Another popular attraction here is the Asian elephant exhibit. Nairobi used to have a safari truck ride called Rhino Rally, similar to Kilimanjaro Safaris at Walt Disney World. The attraction closed in 2015.\n\nEdge of Africa, otherwise known at Cheetah Hunt Plaza, is the smallest section of the park. It features a restaurant, The Serengeti Overlook Restaurant and Pub, the Cheetah Hunt roller coaster, and the Skyride station.\n\nBedouin tents, authentic handicrafts and art create an Egyptian marketplace feel. The primary attraction of the Egypt-themed area is Montu, an inverted steel coaster. Tut's Tomb, a former audio guided walk-through tomb excavation closed in Winter 2013 and the interior was gutted to make way for the queue for Cobra's Curse. The former Golden Scarab Gift Shop was converted into a gift shop at the exit of the attraction.\n\nBusch Gardens is Tampa's largest zoo, with more than 200 species of animals.\n\nA state-of-the-art facility that allows visitors to view animal care being conducted from treatments to x-rays.\n\nA free flight aviary that shows over 500 tropical birds from around the globe including parrots, flamingos and others. The original section of the park opened in 1959. The area for the most part remains mostly gardens and animal exhibits. A staple attraction that once stood in this section was the brewery. However, the brewery closed in 1995 and Gwazi now sits where the brewery was located. In 2014, the Bird Gardens theater was demolished and the former show (Critter Castaways) is now housed in the Pantopia Theater under the new name \"Opening Night Critters\".\n\nOpened in 1997, Edge of Africa is a walk-through attraction where guests can observe African animals. Among the exhibits are a Nile crocodile named Sobek, meerkats, two prides of lions, a pack of spotted hyenas, three hippos named Moyo, Kita and Devi, vultures, and a troop of lemurs.\n\nThe three newest members of the lion pride include a male named Kembe and two females named Shaba and Shtuko. They arrived at the park as cubs in 2013 from a zoo in Africa. Another pride of lions at the park include a male named Simon and two females named Rose and Iris. Iris and Rose are unable to have cubs as they have been spayed.\n\nThe hippos Moyo and Kita are never exhibited together, being father and daughter, and being unaware of this would try to mate with each other. Therefore, both are rotated into the exhibit and holding area day by day to avoid accidental inbreeding.\n\nIn 1965, the park opened its Serengeti Plain animal habitat, the first of its kind to offer animals in a free-roaming environment. Over the years, the habitat has expanded from to its current size of . It is home to the Grévy's zebra, Grant's zebra, sable antelope, reticulated giraffe, Ankole-Watusi, addax, white rhinoceros, eland, impala, ostrich and marabou stork. Also, in a secluded area of this region is a solitary female black rhinoceros named Jodi.\n\nFrom January to March, Busch Gardens hosts a weekly concert series which invites popular bands either in big band music or pop to perform classic or contemporary songs.\n\n(Previously called Bud & BBQ and Bands, Brew & BBQ) For the months of March & April, Busch Gardens hosts a series of concerts in Gwazi Field, mostly from classic rock and country music acts. Sometimes the event includes alternative rock, pop, hip hop and R&B acts as well as comedians. Also, there are special culinary offerings that include a variety of ethnic food and wine samplings from various local vendors along the walkway from the Gwazi Roller Coaster to the gate in Gwazi Field.\n\nThe documentary film \"Blackfish\" and a subsequent online petition led to several popular musical groups cancelling performances at SeaWorld and Busch Gardens \"Bands, Brew & BBQ\" event in 2014. This caused the removal of the event in Tampa, which was replaced by the annual Food and Wine Festival, resembling the one currently at Epcot in Walt Disney World Orlando.\n\nIn March, several Latin music acts are hosted on the stage in Gwazi Field. There is a similar culinary setup with special offerings for the concert days as there is for Bands, Brew & BBQ.\n\nIn the summer months, the park stays open later and includes concerts by performers like David Cassidy and Starship with Mickey Thomas. The park's Independence Day festivities add fireworks to the entertainment lineup.\n\nIn 2010, Busch Gardens added a new nighttime show called Kinetix, the first special effect-heavy show put on in Gwazi Field. Also, they added many new special effects (i.e. Strobe, Lighting, Fog) to the existing rides just for the Summer Nights season. Kinetix discontinued after the 2016 Summer Nights\n\nSince 2017, Busch Gardens Summer Nights now includes party zones where guests can dance with Party Starters and DJs to the music and compete for special prizes. The most major party zones are ¡Fiesta Festa! in the Cheetah Hunt Plaza and Tigris's Party Zone (formally Viben Village) in Stanleyville. On every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, guests can compete in the “Dance Challenge“ at Gwazi Park to win 4 FREE tickets to Adventure Island as well as an epic fireworks show directly afterward.\n\nEvery September and October since 2000, Busch Gardens is transformed into Howl-O-Scream. This event contains haunted houses, scare zones and shows. Howl-O-Scream is one of the top rated Halloween events in the United States. Howl-O-Scream has featured some attractions of the park turned into \"horrified\" attractions at night. This includes Serengeti Safari Tours, which was turned into Evening Serengeti Safari Tours and Curiosity Caverns, which was turned into Dark Cavern, both in 2000. In 2012, Howl-O-Scream celebrated 13 \"unlucky\" years.\n\nFrom November to December, theaters throughout the park are transformed into Christmas-themed shows (Like Christmas On Ice in the Moroccan Palace) in celebration of the holiday season for an event called Christmas Town. The whole park is decorated with over a million Christmas lights and theming. Among the more popular attractions is Snow World, in which guests can play in real snow and ride down ice slides. This event was first introduced in 2012. At Santa's House, guests can bring their little ones and have pictures taken with Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, and Santa's Elves right next to the Nairobi Train Station which circles around the Serengeti Plain as the Christmas Town Sing Along Train featuring select Christmas carols and songs. Also, guests can meet the stars from \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" over in Rudolph's Winter Wonderland since 2016. Plus, two Christmas Town princesses can be spotted in the Icy Forest (Ice Princess), and the poinsettia trees (Poinsettia Princess) which guests can also have pictures taken. Princess Fae, a sugarplum princess made her debue during the 2019 Christmas Town season. The poinsetta, sugarplum and icy princesses can also be seen together there near closing time.\n\nDuring New Year's Eve, Busch Gardens celebrates the new year by hosting live music throughout the park, thrill rides opened through the night and fireworks located at the Gwazi Field. Including a park-wide countdown to the new year.\n\nThe following is a list of roller coasters at Busch Gardens Tampa that have placed on \"Amusement Today's\" award or nomination list, along with the highest ranking and year awarded or nominated. Busch Gardens Tampa has also been nominated for best landscaping in 1998 and 2007.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is native to warm temperate to tropical regions of the Old World, as well as being cultivated and naturalized in the New World and on many oceanic islands.\n\nThe genus name comes from Greek words meaning \"dog-tooth\". The genus as a whole as well as its species are commonly known as Bermuda grass or dog's tooth grass.\n\n\nSeveral species now considered better suited to other genera, namely \"Arundo\", \"Bouteloua\", \"Brachyachne\", \"Chloris\", \"Cortaderia\", \"Ctenium\", \"Digitaria\", \"Diplachne\", \"Eleusine\", \"Enteropogon\", \"Eragrostis\", \"Eustachys\", \"Gynerium\", \"Leptochloa\", \"Molinia\", \"Muhlenbergia\", \"Phragmites\", \"Poa\", \"Spartina\", \"Tridens\", and \"Trigonochloa\".\nSome species, most commonly \"C. dactylon\", are grown as lawn grasses in warm temperate regions, such as the Sunbelt area of the United States where they are valued for their drought tolerance compared to most other lawn grasses. Propagation is by rhizomes, stolons, or seeds. In some cases it is considered to be a weed; it spreads through lawns and flower beds, where it can be difficult to kill with herbicides without damaging other grasses or plants. It is difficult to pull out because the rhizomes and stolons break readily, and then re-grow.\n\nIt is also noted for its common use on the surface of greens on golf courses, as well as football and baseball playing fields.\n\nRecent news reports claim that a Bermuda-derived F hybrid called \"Tifton 85\" suddenly started producing cyanide and killed a cattle herd in Texas, USA.\n\n"}

{"id": "1914152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914152", "title": "Bagram torture and prisoner abuse", "text": "Bagram torture and prisoner abuse\n\nIn 2005, \"The New York Times\" obtained a 2,000-page United States Army investigatory report concerning the homicides of two unarmed civilian Afghan prisoners by U.S. military personnel in December 2002 at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility (also \"Bagram Collection Point\" or \"B.C.P.\") in Bagram, Afghanistan and general treatment of prisoners. The two prisoners, Habibullah and Dilawar, were repeatedly chained to the ceiling and beaten, resulting in their deaths. Military coroners ruled that both the prisoners' deaths were homicides. Autopsies revealed severe trauma to both prisoners' legs, describing the trauma as comparable to being run over by a bus. Seven soldiers were charged in 2005.\n\nThe alleged torture and homicides took place at the military detention center known as the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, which had been built by the Soviets as an aircraft machine shop during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1980–1989). A concrete-and-sheet metal facility that was retrofitted with wire pens and wooden isolation cells, the center is part of Bagram Air Base in the ancient city of Bagram near Charikar in Parvan, Afghanistan.\n\nIn January 2010, the American military released the names of 645 detainees held at the main detention center at Bagram, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This was to comply with a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawyers had also demanded detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations at the center.\n\nHabibullah died on December 4, 2002. Several U.S. soldiers hit the chained man with so-called \"peroneal strikes,\" or severe blows to the side of the leg above the knee. This incapacitates the leg by hitting the common peroneal nerve. According to \"The New York Times\":\n\nWhen medics arrived, they found Habibullah dead.\n\nDilawar, who died on December 10, 2002, was a 22-year-old Afghan taxi driver and farmer who weighed 122 pounds and was described by his interpreters as neither violent nor aggressive.\n\nWhen beaten, he repeatedly cried \"Allah!\" The outcry appears to have amused U.S. military personnel. The act of striking him in order to provoke a scream of \"Allah!\" eventually \"became a kind of running joke,\" according to one of the MPs. \"People kept showing up to give this detainee a common peroneal strike just to hear him scream out 'Allah,'\" he said. \"It went on over a 24-hour period, and I would think that it was over 100 strikes.\"\n\nThe \"Times\" reported that:\n\nIn the documentary \"Taxi to the Dark Side\" (2007), directed by American filmmaker Alex Gibney, there was a claim that Dilawar was captured while driving through militia territory, not going past Bagram air base. The militia stopped him at a roadblock and transferred him to the U.S. Army for a monetary reward, claiming he was a terrorist.\n\nDr. Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani citizen educated in the United States as a neuroscientist, was suspected of the attempted assault and killing of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. She disappeared in 2003 with her three children. She was allegedly detained for five years at Bagram with her children; she was the only female prisoner. She was known to the male detainees as \"Prisoner 650.\" The media dubbed her as the \"Mata Hari of al-Qaida\" or the \"Grey Lady of Bagram.\" Yvonne Ridley says that Siddiqui is the \"Grey Lady of Bagram\" – a ghostly female detainee, who kept prisoners awake \"with her haunting sobs and piercing screams\". In 2005 male prisoners were so agitated by her plight, Ridley said, that they went on hunger strike for six days. Siddiqui's family maintains that she was abused at Bagram.\n\nIn 2008 Aafia Siddiqui was tried in federal district court in Manhattan on charges of terrorism. She denounced the 2008 trial, saying, \"(an appeal would be) a waste of time. I appeal to God. \" According to reports, 12-year-old Ahmed (Dr Aafia's son) was transferred to his aunt Fauzia Siddiqui in September 2008 after years of being detained with his mother in a US military base in Afghanistan. Later a little girl named Fatima was dropped off at the home of Siddiqui's sister; the girl's DNA matched that of Ahmed (Dr Aafia's son). Pakistani Senator Talha Mehmood, chairman of the Pakistani Senate's Standing Committee on Interior, \"slammed the US for keeping the child in a military jail in a cold, dark room for seven years.\" The fate of Siddiqui's other son is unknown.\n\nMohamed immigrated to the U.K. from Ethiopia in 1994 and sought asylum. In 2001 he converted to Islam and travelled to Pakistan, followed by Afghanistan, to see if the Taliban-run Afghanistan was \"a good Islamic country\". U.S. authorities believed that he was a would-be bomber, who fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan. Pakistani immigration officials arrested him at the airport in April 2002 before he returned to the U.K. Mohamed has said officials have used evidence gained through torture in sites in Pakistan, Morocco and Afghanistan between 2002 and 2004 before he was \"secretly rendered\" to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detention camp on Cuba. In October 2008, the U.S. dropped all charges against him. Mohamed was reported as being very ill as a result of a hunger strike in the weeks before his release. In February 2009 Mohamed was interviewed by Moazzam Begg, a fellow Bagram detainee and founder of CagePrisoners, an organization to help released detainees. Mohamad identified a photo of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui as the woman whom he and other male detainees had seen at Bagram, known as \"Prisoner 650.\"\n\nMohammed Sulaymon Barre, a Somali refugee who worked for a funds transfer company, described his Bagram interrogation as \"torture.\" Barre said he was picked up and thrown around the interrogation room when he wouldn't confess to a false allegation. He was put into an isolation chamber that was maintained at a piercingly cold temperature for several weeks and deprived of sufficient rations during this period. As a result of this treatment, his hands and feet swelled, causing him such excruciating pain that he could not stand up.\n\nZalmay Shah, a citizen of Afghanistan, alleges mistreatment during detention at Bagram air base. An article published in the May 2, 2007 issue of \"The New Republic\" contained excerpts from an interview with Zalmay Shah. He said he had originally cooperated closely with the Americans. He had worked with an American he knew only as \"Tony\" in the roundup of former members of the Taliban. According to the article:\n\nZalmay Shah was eventually released. He said that Americans continue to ask for his cooperation, but he now declines.\n\nOthers include Mohammed Salim and Moazzam Begg.\n\nIn October 2004, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command concluded that there was probable cause to charge 27 officers and enlisted personnel with criminal offenses in the Dilawar case, ranging from dereliction of duty to maiming and involuntary manslaughter. Fifteen of the same soldiers were also cited for probable criminal responsibility in the Habibullah case. Seven soldiers have been charged so far. According to an article published in the October 15, 2004 \"The New York Times\" 28 soldiers were under investigation. Some of the soldiers were reservists in the 377th Military Police Company under the command of Captain Christopher M. Beiring. The rest were in the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion under the command of Captain Carolyn A. Wood.\n\nOn October 14, 2004, the Criminal Investigation Command forwarded its report from its investigation to the commanders of 28 soldiers.\n\nAs of November 15, 2005, 15 soldiers have been charged.\n\nSome interrogators involved in this incident were sent to Iraq and were assigned to Abu Ghraib prison. PFC Corsetti was fined and demoted while assigned to Abu Ghraib for not having permission to conduct an interrogation.\n\nA May 2005 editorial of \"The New York Times\" noted parallels between military behavior at Bagram and the later abuse and torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in Iraq:\n\nIn November 2001, Col. Morgan Banks, chief psychologist of the SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) program, was sent to Afghanistan. He worked for four months at Bagram. In early 2003, Banks issued guidance for the \"behavioral science consultants\" who helped to devise Guantánamo's interrogation strategy. He has emphatically denied having advocated use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees.\n\nThe United States government through the Department of State makes periodic reports to the United Nations Committee Against Torture. In October 2005, the report focused on pretrial detention of suspects in the War on Terrorism, including those held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and in Afghanistan. This particular report is significant as the first official response of the U.S. government to allegations of widespread abuse of prisoners in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay. The report denies the allegations.\n\nThe McCain amendment was an amendment to the United States Senate Department of Defense Authorization bill, commonly referred to as the \"Amendment on (1) the Army Field Manual and (2) Cruel, Inhumane, Degrading Treatment, amendment #1977\" and also known as the \"McCain Amendment 1977\". The amendment prohibited inhumane treatment of prisoners. The Amendment was introduced by Senator John McCain. On October 5, 2005, the United States Senate voted 90-9 to support the amendment, which was later signed into law by President George W. Bush.\n\nIn May 2010, the BBC reported about nine prisoners who \"told consistent stories of being held in isolation in cold cells where a light is on all day and night. The men said they had been deprived of sleep by US military personnel there.\" When the BBC sought information from the International Committee of the Red Cross about this, the ICRC revealed that it had been informed in August 2009 by US authorities that they maintained a second facility at Bagram, where detainees were held in isolation due to \"military necessity.\" This was an exception to the principle of allowing guaranteed access for all prisoners to the International Red Cross.\n\nThe 2007 documentary \"Taxi to the Dark Side\" (2007), directed by American filmmaker Alex Gibney, focuses on the murder of Dilawar by US troops at Bagram.\n\n\n"}

They are among the few terrestrial placental mammals that colonised Australia without human intervention.\n\nThis genus contains a number of species with different habits making generalisation difficult. The overall body size varies widely, ranging from 60–160 mm. The tail is 60–180 mm and the weight is recorded from 12–90 g. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats from rainforests to plains and grasslands. The animals are nocturnal and spend the day in burrows. Food also varies with some species eating seeds, roots and insects while others feed primarily on grasses. The pebble-mound mice are unique in creating mounds of stones around their burrows. Several species of \"Pseudomys\" are threatened due to competition with introduced species and habitat destruction. Several others are probably extinct.\n\nThe name \"Pseudomys\" means \"false mouse\" presumably in reference to both its similarity and uniqueness from \"true mice\" in the genus \"Mus\".\n\nGenus Pseudomys - Australian native mice\n\n"}
{"id": "1914156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914156", "title": "Studer", "text": "Studer\n\nStuder is a formerly Swiss designer and manufacturer of audio equipment for recording studios and broadcasters. The company was founded in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1948 by Willi Studer. It initially became known in the 1950s for its professional tape recorders. In the 1990s the company moved into the manufacture of mixing consoles.\n\nManagement, sales, engineering, R&D and customer service were based in Regensdorf, Switzerland, until owners Harman International Industries closed down the Swiss entity in March 2018 transferring the now decentralised operation to China, Hungary, and the US. Manufacturing, marketing, and customer support were part of the Soundcraft facility in Potters Bar, England until Harman closed the Potters Bar facility in June 2016 and moved manufacturing and customer support to Hungary. Studer is currently a subsidiary of Harman International Industries which is owned by Samsung Electronics.\n\nWilli Studer began to make high-tension oscilloscopes in 1948. These products were in production until 1968. In March 1951, Studer introduced the Revox brand name subsidiary.\n\nIn 1990, Studer sold the Studer-Revox group to Motor-Columbus AG, including all subsidiary companies. In 1991, Motor-Columbus split the Studer-Revox Group into separate Studer, Revox and manufacturing-divisions. Motor-Columbus sold several subsidiaries and plants.\n\nThe extensive reorganization culminated in the sale of the Studer group to Harman International Industries in March 1994. The Revox group was excluded and sold to private investors. On March 17, 1994, Harman completed its acquisition and acquired from Motor-Columbus AG 100% of Studer-Revox AG.\n\nHarman paid 100 Swiss Francs (approximately US $70.00) for all of the issued and outstanding stock in Studer-Revox. Harman assumed post-acquisition indebtedness of Studer-Revox of approximately 23 million Swiss Francs (approximately US $16 million). Harman later moved some of its Studer business operations to England and merged them with operations of its Soundcraft subsidiary.\n\nWilli Studer died on March 1, 1996.\n\nIn 1949, Studer branched out into the audio business by modifying imported tape recorders from the United States. By 1950, they had developed their own line of tape recorders, named the Dynavox series. The company has built a variety of 2-track recorder models throughout its history for stereo recording.\n\nSeveral Studer components were sold under the Revox name, with slight modifications, at a lower price. The Revox variants were designed for consumer use, with features such as IR remote control, and the omission of balanced input/output sockets. The core circuitry of the two was otherwise substantially identical. One of the company's models was the Revox A77 recorder, which was introduced in 1967. \n\nStuder designed and produced multitrack recorders. Studer’s first multi-track machine, the model J37, was released in 1964. It recorded 4 tracks on one inch tape. A pair of J37s were used by The Beatles to record \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" in 1967. Later analog Studer machines were built in 8, 16, and 24-track configurations using tape widths of up to two inches.\n\nSales of analog machines continued into the early 1990s, when they began to be replaced by digital recorders. In this period, Studer introduced the D820 and D827 multitrack models, which employed the Digital Audio Stationary Head standard. However, digital tape formats eventually fell from favor with the introduction of computerized hard disk drive recording systems and software products such as Pro Tools.\n\nIn the mid 1990s Studer started to develop digital mixing consoles. After introduction of OnAir 2000 with Touch'n Action user interface in 1997, the D950 was the first digital large frame desk Studer introduced in 1998. With Vista Series (Vista 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, V, and X) Studer launched in 2003 the Vistonics user interface with knobs-on-glass technology. Some older Vista models have been discontinued but Vista 1, 5, V, and X remain in production. Vista 5BE (Black Edition) is the latest model of this series continuing the use of x86 CPU technology replacing SHARC based DSP engines.\n\nThe Studer Vista 9M2 (launched September 2013) is a TV broadcast/live production console equipped with the patented Vistonics knobs-on-glass user interface and FaderGlow is used by TV broadcasters including the BBC, RAI, France TV, TV Globo, ABC, NRK, DR and many others. Studer also offers radio broadcast consoles with the Glacier control surfaces (replacing the now discontinued On Air 3000 and 2500 controllers) added to the remaining On Air range that includes the OnAir 1500.\n\n"}
