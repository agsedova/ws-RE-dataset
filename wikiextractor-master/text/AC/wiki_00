Located in the northwest of the island, in the middle od two whims of nature: the ravines of Franceses (by the North) bordering Barlovento and Izcagua by the South (born at the foot of the Roque de los Muchachos), bordering Punta Gorda . The administrative capital, home to the City Council, is called Santo Domingo and has a length of 25.50 km coastline. with cliffs of incredible beauty but very steep and difficult to access, which can only be reached on foot, demanding a great effort to those not used to walking on rough terrain.

Its administrative capital, Santo Domingo, where resides the City, is located at an altitude of 400 meters.\n\nThe climate in the coastal zone is smooth, with many windy days motivated by the impact of the trade winds in the area, most of the time being its very choppy sea. In the area of middle altitude called medianías, part of the territory in between 400 and 1200 meters over the sea level, very extensive, the temperature is colder, and is a place where the land is very rich. At this altitude is seen in the cool nights of Roque del Faro, Hoya Grande or Llano Negro, mild climate to the extent we drove south on Catela, El Castillo or Las Tricias.

The Roque de los Muchachos, on the edge of La Caldera de Taburiente, given its unique location, bathed by trade winds from the Atlantic, laminar, non-turbulent cold air, make it one of the prime locations in the northern hemisphere for astronomical observation.\n\nThis town, which had in 1960 almost 5,000 inhabitants, has strongly suffered the phenomenon of emigration, since today is only 1,700 inhabitants, according to the INE (National Institute of Statistics, January 2012). Located on the steepest part of the island of La Palma, the development of communications came very late, still the road to Las Mimbreras the milestone causing its gradual depopulation and abandonment. Because of this secular isolation has preserved its rural, natural and ecological character, what he has done having great potential for rural tourism, together with a complex set of paths and trails (ancient trails) that are a delight for visitors, vestige of an important past and that captivate trekkers for its natural scenic charms.\n\nThe municipality of Garafía is in itself a monument to Mother Nature. It should be borne in mind that in its 103 km²,all three together Natural Monument Coast Hiscaguán, the Special Guelguén Natural Reserve and the Integral Natural reserve of Pinar de Garafía, are in total almost one third of the entire surface of the municipality. This reflects the high commitment and respect to the nature of local government of the municipality of Garafía.

The coastline is rough with steep cliffs and gorges and can be accessed at several points.\n\nTraditionally, the villages have been noted for their lack of geographical communication and their isolated remoteness. Until the 1960s the villages were largely isolated from the rest of the island and only accessible by donkey paths. Since then roads have been built and the area is easily accessible on good, but twisty, asphalted roads.\nAs with many rural areas the population is in decline as small-scale agriculture and traditional rural life does not provide the income to encourage young people to stay.\n\nIt is a wonderful area for walking and hiking with its network of marked walking paths, lush greenery and spectacular scenery.

This was similar to the Million Dollar Championship in the World Wrestling Federation in that it was not an officially sanctioned championship.\n\nThe FTW Heavyweight Championship was created by ECW owner Paul Heyman to compensate for storylines that had to be dropped due to injuries. ECW World Heavyweight Champion Shane Douglas had a serious sinus infection and an elbow injury. Taz and Al Snow also missed their matches at \"WrestlePalooza '98\" due to health problems. He gave the title to Taz, as it suited his \"bad-ass, no-nonsense\" attitude.\"\n\nTaz announced the creation of the FTW Heavyweight Championship on May 14, 1998 at It Ain't Seinfeld. In the storyline, he was frustrated by his inability to challenge for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship due to Champion Shane Douglas' injury and refusal to face him. Taz created and defended his own World title, billing himself as the \"real\" World champion. He states that fans appreciated the message conveyed by the belt, which represented contempt for bosses and society, and says that he believes it was more appreciated than the company's top title. The belt was billed as \"unrecognized\" by ECW.\n\nTaz lost the title only once, in a singles match against Sabu. This was an intentional loss, when he pulled an unconscious Sabu over himself on December 19, 1998 (he was confident that he would defeat Shane Douglas in an upcoming title bout, and thus no longer needed the FTW Heavyweight Championship). Taz regained the title at Living Dangerously on March 21, 1999, where he unified the FTW Heavyweight Championship with the ECW World Heavyweight Championship (which he then held) by defeating Sabu in a title versus title match. Taz then began using only the ECW World Heavyweight Championship belt, being the sole World Heavyweight Champion in the promotion.\n\nWhen the title was first created, the FTW belt was actually the same custom ECW Television Championship belt Taz used for a while with a leather strap that Taz painted orange and stickers partially covering the belt. and a \"TAZ\" logo at the top. \"FTW\" stickers were strategically placed over the word \"Television\" in the middle of the belt as well as the United States and United Kingdom flags on the side plates. A few months later, in an attempt to persuade Taz to team with Sabu and Rob Van Dam against Shane Douglas and The Triple Threat, Bill Alfonso presented Taz with a completely new and original FTW belt with a \"TAZ\" logo engraved in the belt's centerplate.\n\nTaz states that the concept and attitude have been replicated by other companies.\n\nAccording to Taz on \"The Rise and Fall of ECW\" DVD documentary, when he lost the new belt in a match against Sabu, Sabu was legitimately upset backstage over Taz's name being permanently displayed on the belt. From then on, whenever Sabu had the belt with him, he would cover the Taz logo with athletic tape and write \"SABU\" on it in magic marker. The championship is owned now by the WWE, but they have not chosen to revive it.\n\n"}
{"id": "2045792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045792", "title": "Mark Taper Forum", "text": "Mark Taper Forum\n\nThe Mark Taper Forum is a 739-seat thrust stage at the Los Angeles Music Center designed by Welton Becket and Associates on the Bunker Hill section of Downtown Los Angeles. Named for real estate developer Mark Taper, the Forum, the neighboring Ahmanson Theatre and the Kirk Douglas Theatre are all operated by the Center Theatre Group.\n\nThe Mark Taper Forum opened in 1967 as part of the Los Angeles Music Center, the West Coast equivalent of Lincoln Center, designed by Los Angeles architect Welton Becket. The dedication took place on April 9, 1967, at an event attended by Governor Ronald Reagan. The smallest of the three venues, the Taper is flanked by the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Ahmanson Theatre on the Music Center Plaza.\n\nBecket designed the center in the style of New Formalism, which emphasized geometric shapes. The perfectly circular Taper is considered one of his best works, featuring a distinctive decorated drum of a design with its exterior wrapped in a lacy precast relief by Jacques Overhoff. The lobby has a curving, abalone wall by Tony Duquette. Charles Moore described Becket's design for the Music Center as \"Late Imperial Depression-Style cake\".\n\nBecket designed the building not knowing who would use it. Various proposals included chamber music concerts, or even grand jury meetings. Ultimately Dorothy Chandler, the Los Angeles cultural leader, convinced Center Theater Group artistic director Gordon Davidson to use the Taper. For 38 years, Davidson was the artistic director of Center Theater Group, which also ran the Ahmanson and eventually the Kirk Douglas Theater in Culver City. The Taper became known for its thrust stage, jutting into a classical, semicircular amphitheater, which creates an especially intimate relationship between audience and performer.\n\nThe building bears an architectural resemblance to Carousel Theatre at Disneyland, also designed by Welton Becket and Associates in 1967. It is similar in design concept and size to the Dallas Theatre Center, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and the original Tyrone Guthrie Theatre, in Minneapolis.\n\nOn October 8, 1993, a memorial was held in the actor Richard Jordan's honor. It was the same day his final movie \"Gettysburg\" was released.\n\nA $30-million renovation of the Taper led by the Los Angeles firm Rios Clementi Hale Studios began in July 2007 after the 2006/2007 season. The theater reopened on August 30, 2008 for the first preview of John Guare's \"The House of Blue Leaves\".\n\nThe Taper, as originally designed, was a case study in what happens when a theater is built without a tenant in mind. Fitting the auditorium into the circular building left a tiny backstage and only a narrow, curved hallway for a lobby.\n\nThe renovation updated nearly everything that was not concrete and did not disrupt the building's circular shape. To create a larger main lobby, the designers reduced the ticket booth and removed about 30 parking spaces from the lower-level garage to move the restrooms below ground as part of a stylized lounge with gold, curved couches and mosaics of mirrored tiles that fit the era in which the building was designed. The theater seats are wider and total capacity was reduced from 745 to 739. The entrance was moved to the plaza level and an elevator added to increase the accessibility of the theater.\n\nThe original theater also had very few women's restrooms opening with four women's stalls for a 750-seat hall. The renovation increased the number of stalls to 16. Backstage, changes included removing an outdated stage \"treadmill\" and old air-conditioning equipment, installing a modern lighting grid, and enlarging the load-in door to 6 feet by 9 feet. A wardrobe room was constructed in the space previously occupied by the air-conditioning equipment.\n\nThe auditorium was renamed the Amelia Taper Auditorium after a $2 million gift from the S. Mark Taper Foundation.\n\nThe Taper has presented innovative plays since its 1967-opening of \"The Devils\" from playwright John Whiting about the sexual fantasies of a 17th-century priest and a sexually repressed nun. The play received a great deal of protest from local religious leaders and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, although the production continued.\n\nThe production of such plays as \"Murderous Angels\", \"The Dream on Monkey Mountain\", \"Children of a Lesser God\", \"Savages\", \"The Shadow Box\", \"The Kentucky Cycle\" and \"Angels in America\" has established definition of a \"Taper play\"; one which is provocative, political and liberal.\n\nThe Taper has been host to world premiere productions of many notable plays including \"The Shadow Box\" (1975), \"Zoot Suit\" (1978), \"Children of a Lesser God\" (1979), Neil Simon's \"I Ought To Be In Pictures\" (1980), Lanford Wilson's \"Burn This\" (1987), \"Jelly's Last Jam\" (1991), \"Angels in America\" (1992), \"\" (1993), David Henry Hwang's revised version of \"Flower Drum Song\" (2001), August Wilson's \"Radio Golf\" (2005) and the musical \"13\" (2007).\n\nIn all, the theater has 5 Tony Awards to its credit.\n\n"}
{"id": "2045793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045793", "title": "Mameluke sword", "text": "Mameluke sword\n\nA Mameluke sword is a cross-hilted, curved, scimitar-like sword historically derived from sabres used by Mamluk warriors of Mamluk Egypt after whom the sword is named. It is related to the swords of the Seljuq empire. \n\nThe curved scimitar blades were Central Asian Turkic in origin from where the style migrated to India, Egypt and North Africa and the Turkish kilij. It was adopted in the 19th century by several Western militaries, including the French Army, British Army and the United States Marine Corps. Although some genuine Ottoman sabres were used by Westerners, most \"mameluke sabres\" were manufactured in Europe or America; their hilts were very similar in form to the Ottoman prototype, but their blades tended to be longer, narrower and less curved than those of the true kilij, while being wider and also less curved than the Persian shamshir. \n\nIn short, the hilt retained its original shape. but the blade tended to resemble the blade-form typical of contemporary Western military sabres. The Mameluke sword remains the ceremonial side arm for some units to this day.\n\nMarine Corps history states that a sword of this type was presented to Marine First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon by the Ottoman Empire viceroy, Prince Hamet, on December 8, 1805, during the First Barbary War, in Libya, as a gesture of respect and praise for the Marines' actions at the Battle of Derna (1805). Upon his return to the United States, the state of Virginia presented him with a silver-hilted sword featuring an eaglehead hilt and a curved blade modeled after the original Mameluke sword given to him by Hamet. Its blade is inscribed with his name and a commemoration of the Battle of Tripoli Harbor.\n\nPerhaps due to the Marines' distinguished record during this campaign, including the capture of the Tripolitan city of Derna after a long and dangerous desert march, Marine Corps Commandant Archibald Henderson adopted the Mameluke sword in 1825 for wear by Marine officers. After initial distribution in 1826, Mameluke swords have been worn except for the years 1859–1875 (when Marine officers were required to wear the U.S. Model 1850 Army foot officers' sword), and a brief period when swords were suspended during World War II. Since that time, Mameluke swords have been worn by Marine officers in a continuing tradition to the present day.\n\nMameluke swords were adopted by officers of light cavalry regiments in the first decade of the 19th century, some were used as 'walking out swords' (for ornamental wear on social occasions on foot) but others were employed on active campaign. They are prominent in images of officers of the Hussars painted by Robert Dighton in 1807. As officially regulated dress or levée swords they first appear in 1822 for lancer regiments. Later, other light cavalry and some heavy cavalry regiments also adopted similar patterns. Though broadly similar in form, each regiment's swords had individual variations in the decoration of both blade and hilt. The current regulation sword for generals, the 1831 Pattern, is a Mameluke-style sword, as were various Army Band swords.\n\nThere are a number of factors which influenced the fashion for Mameluke swords in the British Army.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2045796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045796", "title": "De Tomaso Pantera", "text": "De Tomaso Pantera\n\nThe De Tomaso Pantera is a mid-engine sports car produced by Italian automobile manufacturer De Tomaso from 1971 to 1993. Italian for \"Panther\", the Pantera was the automaker's most popular model, with over 7,000 manufactured over its twenty-year production run.\n\nThe Pantera was designed by the Italian design firm Ghia's American-born designer Tom Tjaarda and replaced the Mangusta. Unlike the Mangusta, which employed a steel backbone chassis, the Pantera's chassis was of a steel monocoque design, the first instance of De Tomaso using this construction technique. The Pantera logo included a T-shaped symbol that was the brand used by De Tomaso's Argentinian cattle ranching ancestors, as well as a version of the Argentinean flag turned on its side, inspired by the company's founder, Alejandro De Tomaso, having been born and raised in Argentina.\nThe car debuted in Modena in March 1970 and was presented at the 1970 New York Motor Show a few weeks later. Approximately a year later the first production cars were sold, and production was increased to three per day.\n\nThe slat-backed seats which had attracted criticism at the New York Auto Show were replaced by more conventional body-hugging sports seats in the production cars: leg-room was generous but the pedals were off-set and headroom was insufficient for drivers above approximately tall. Reflecting its makers' transatlantic ambitions, the Pantera came with an abundance of standard features which appeared exotic in Europe, such as electric windows, air conditioning and even \"doors that buzz when ... open\". By the time the Pantera reached production stage, the interior was in most respects well sorted, although resting an arm on the central console could lead to inadvertently activating the poorly located cigarette lighter.\n\nThe first 1971 Pantera models were powered by a \"Ford Cleveland\" V8 engine having a power output of . The high torque provided by the Ford engine reduced the need for excessive gear changing at low speeds: this made the car much less demanding to drive in urban conditions than many of the locally built offerings.\n\nThe ZF transaxle used in the Mangusta was also used for the Pantera: a passenger in an early Pantera recorded that the mechanical noises emanating from the transaxle were more intrusive than the well restrained engine noise. Another Italian car that shares the ZF transaxle is the Maserati Bora, also launched in 1971 although not yet available for sale. Power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes and rack and pinion steering were all standard equipment on the Pantera. The 1971 Pantera could accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) in 5.5 seconds according to \"Car and Driver\".\n\nLate in 1971, Ford began importing the Pantera for the American market to be sold through its Lincoln Mercury dealers. The first 75 cars were simply European imports and are known for their \"push-button\" door handles and hand-built Carrozzeria Vignale bodies. A total of 1,007 cars reached the United States that year. As with most Italian cars of the day, rust-proofing was minimal and the quality of fit and finish on these early models was poor with large amounts of body solder being used to cover body panel flaws. Subsequently, Ford increased their involvement in the production of the later cars with the introduction of precision stampings for body panels which resulted in improved overall quality. \nSeveral modifications were made to the Pantera for the 1972 model year. A new 4 Bolt Main Cleveland Engine, was used with lower compression ratio (from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard fuel) but with the more aggressive \"Cobra Jet\" camshaft (featuring the same lift and duration as the 428 Cobra Jet's factory performance cam) in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost through the reduction in compression ratio along with a dual point distributor. Many other engine changes were made, including the use of a factory exhaust header.\n\nThe \"Lusso\" (luxury) Pantera L was also introduced in August 1972 as a 1972½ model. For the US market, it featured a large black single front bumper that incorporated a built-in airfoil to reduce front end lift at high speeds, rather than the separate bumperettes still used abroad, as well as the Cleveland engine now having a power output of . The \"L\" model featured many factory upgrades and updates that fixed most of the problems and issues the earlier cars experienced. It was so improved that the 1973 DeTomaso Pantera was Road Test Magazine's Import car of the year beating offerings from Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, and Porsche. During 1973 the dashboard was changed, deviating from two separate pods for the gauges to a unified unit with the dials angled towards the driver. The U.S. version of the 1974 Pantera GTS featured optional GTS badging but not the higher compression engine of its European counterpart.\n\nFord stopped importing the Pantera to the US in 1975, having sold around 5,500 cars. De Tomaso continued to build the car in ever-escalating forms of performance and luxury for almost two decades for sale in the rest of the world. A small number of cars were imported to the US by gray market importers in the 1980s, notably Panteramerica and AmeriSport. After 1974, Ford discontinued the Cleveland 351 engine, but production continued in Australia until 1982. De Tomaso started sourcing their engines from Australia once the American supplies stopped. These engines were tuned in Switzerland and were available with a range of outputs up to .\n\nAccording to De Tomaso the chassis was completely revised in 1980, beginning with chassis number 9000. From May 1980, the lineup included the GT5, which had bonded and riveted-on fibreglass wheelarch extensions and from November 1984 the GT5-S model which had blended arches and a distinctive wide-body look. The GT5 also incorporated better brakes, a more luxurious interior, much larger wheels and tires and the fiberglass body kit also included an air dam and side skirts. Production of the wide body GT5 (and similarly equipped narrow body GTS models) continued until 1985, when the GT5-S replaced the GT5. Although the factory has not made its records available, an analysis based on Vehicle Identification Numbers by the Pantera Owners Club of America (POCA) late model (9000 series) registrar has shown that fewer than 197 GT5 Pantera models were likely to have been built. The GT5-S featured single piece flared steel fenders instead of the GT5's bolted-on fiberglass flares, and a smaller steel front air dam. The 'S' in the GT5-S name stood for \"steel\". Otherwise the GT5-S was largely identical to the GT5. The POCA 9000 series registrar's VIN analysis indicates that fewer than 183 GT5-S Panteras were built. Concurrent GTS production continued, on a custom order and very limited basis, until the late 1980s.\n\nThe car continued to use a Ford V8 engine, although in 1988, when the supply of Ford 351 Cleveland engines from Australia ran out, De Tomaso began installing Ford 351 Windsor engines in the Pantera instead. In all, about 7,260 cars in total were built.\n\nFor 1990 the 351 engine was replaced by the 5.0-litre Ford 302 engine featuring electronic fuel injection and modified cylinder heads, intake manifolds, camshafts, valves, and pistons. Stopping power was improved by the addition of four-wheel ventilated and drilled disc brakes with Brembo calipers that were shared with the Ferrari F40. The Pantera received new styling penned by Marcello Gandini, suspension redesign and a partial chassis redesign. The new model was called the Pantera 90 Si and it was introduced in 1990. Only 41 90 Si models were made before the Pantera was finally phased out in 1993 to make way for the radical Guarà. Out of the 41 cars made, two were used for crash testing, and one was reserved for the De Tomaso museum. As such, only 38 were sold to the public, of which four were converted to Targas by Pavesi. In the UK, the model was sold as Pantera 90.\n\nDe Tomaso offered a Pantera competition car built to special order according to the Group 3 class racing rules between 1972 and 1984 based on the Pantera GTS. 30 cars were built for private customer teams. Group 3 rules were very strict and allowed little modifications to the original road going production cars. Earlier Group 3 cars are infamously called \"push button\" chassis cars as they were built by hand because De Tomaso didn't have a proper assembly line when the Pantera began production. Special equipment of the Group 3 cars included Campagnolo wheels (15 x 8 inches at the front and 15 x 10 inches at the rear), adjustable Koni shocks, racing brakes and special safety equipment required at the time: plexi-glass windows with cutouts, a roll bar, fire extinguisher and racing bucket seats. The engine modifications included a reinforced camshaft, a 10-litre oil pan and a Holley racing 4 barrel carburetor. Displacement of the engine was also enlarged to 5.8-litres. The engine had a power output of . The engine was mated to a 5-speed close ratio gearbox with a heavy duty single plate clutch and a limited slip differential. It was reported that with the long ratio gears, the Group 3 cars could achieve a top speed up to . The Group 3 cars were so competitive that this prompted Porsche to speed up development of the more powerful 911 Carrera RS and Carrera RSR race cars. The use of racing brakes for the Pantera Group 3 was not allowed until 1975 and the car competed with the brakes of the road legal Pantera which proved to be its weak point. Due to an accident in 1973 at the Charade circuit, reinforced hubs developed by De Tomaso for the Group 3 car were approved in Group 3.\n\nAfter the Pantera had begun production, De Tomaso introduced a motorsport oriented Group 3 version of the car. This was followed by a modified Group 4 version in 1972. British engineer and driver Mike Parkes, who had previously developed racing cars for Ferrari was tasked with the development of the new car.\n\nAs per the regulations, the Group 4 car was based around the road car's steel monocoque chassis. The double wishbone suspension was substantially modified and Koni adjustable shocks were used in order to improve handling at the track and make room for wider Campagnolo wheels and tyres. Bigger ventilated brakes supplied by Girling and a quick ratio steering rack were used to refine handling and stopping power. The standard steel body shell of the Pantera also received modifications such as aluminium doors, front lid and engine cover along with flared fibre glass wheel arches in order to accommodate the wide wheels and tyres. Plexi glass windows were used throughout and holes were cut into the chassis where possible in order to reduce weight. The car had no front or rear bumpers and a front deep chin spoiler. It also didn't had any rustproofing and interior amenities. The interior was fitted with a cut-off switch instead of a radio, light weight cloth bucket racing seats, a vinyl trim, a roll-cage and drilled aluminium pedals. The final car had a weight of .\n\nFord, providing a good amount of financial backing in the development of the road going Pantera had little interest in the motorsport version of the car and refused to supply engines for the Group 4 Pantera. De Tomaso engaged a private US based engine builder Bud Moore to supply engines for the car.\n\nBased on the same Ford 351 Cleveland V8 engine used in the road going Pantera, the engine in the Group 4 Pantera was fitted with bespoke aluminium heads, TRW forged pistons, large capacity oil pans and titanium valves. Initially, a single Holley Racing 1150 CFM four barrel carburetor was fitted but this was replaced by four Weber carburetors and a revised intake. The engine had a higher compression ratio of 12.0:1. Displacement of the racing engine was unchanged from road going Pantera's engine. The \"spaghetti\" styled exhaust system similar to the one used in the Ford GT40 was used. The engine had a claimed power output of . Although the cars ran at a power output of at 7,000 rpm which was increased to when the Weber 850 CFM carburetors were used. The engine was mated to a ZF 5-speed close ratio manual transmission with a heavy duty single clutch plate.\n\nThe first Group 4 Panteras were entered into the 1972 24 Hours of LeMans. The problems of the car then began to become apparent. The engine proved to be unreliable and the car was also subject to a weight penalty, increasing the weight to . This was set reportedly high due to Porsche's influence over the governing body of the race. Another problem of the car was the rigidity of its chassis. Nevertheless, the car continued to compete in Group 4 and the engine problem was addressed by sourcing replacement engines with a lower compression ratio. A total of 14 Group 4 cars were made. Some Group 3 cars were modified to Group 4 specifications by privateers.\n\nThe Group 5 Pantera race cars were converted by private racing teams from Group 4 and Group 3 cars and competed in Group 5 class racing from 1976 to 1981. The Group 5 cars only had wider body panels and no significant design, mechanical and chassis modifications.\n\nHowever, two cars were extensively modified to compete in the IMSA GTX and Group 5 class respectively. The first car having chassis number #001 was constructed from a new chassis by Italian racing team Sala and Marveti. The second car, having chassis number #1603 was a Group 4 car campaigned by Hugh Kleinpeter in the US and then underwent modification. Afterwards, the former was converted to Group C class specifications in 1983 and the latter was converted to IMSA GTP class specifications respectively. Both cars were uncompetitive in their categories.\n\n\n"}

Its main tributaries are the Usomchik, Bolshaya Bludnaya, Upper Baikha, Lower Baikha, Makovskaya. Its mouth is downstream from Turukhansk, where the Lower Tunguska joins the Yenisei. The river is navigable for about from its mouth to the settlement of Yanov Stan. It was part of the canoe route from the Gulf of Ob – Taz River – Turukhan River – Yenisei River – Lower Tunguska – Yakutsk (see Siberian River Routes). The uncompleted Salekhard–Igarka Railway from the Ob to the Yenisei was planned to cross the Turukhan at Yanov Stan.\n"}

Western Albemarle is often simply referred to as Western or WAHS (pronounced \"woz\") by students and locals. The school opened in September 1977. \n\nWestern Albemarle enrolls approximately 1,073 students. It is situated at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains on a seventy-five acre site adjacent to Highway 250 and Interstate 64. WAHS is part of the Albemarle County Public School System, serving the western and central areas of Albemarle County.\n\nThe main feeder school is J. T. Henley Middle School\nWestern Albemarle High School (WAHS) opened its doors to students in fall 1977. Then, the school consisted of two classroom wings (The A and B wings) The fine arts wing with the auditorium, band and choir room, as well as a few more classrooms (The C-Wing) and the gymnasium and athletic wing (D-Wing). The building remained untouched until the 1996 academic year when a new addition to the school was opened. This addition added four classrooms and two science labs to the B-Wing and a new auxiliary gymnasium and athletic offices to the D-Wing. In 2005 a new, modern weight room was added to the D-Wing. In 2011, the school received a total overhaul of their athletic field. A brand new AstroTurf playing field and rubber running track was installed using funds from an anonymous donor. In 2015, a renovation to the media center was conducted to enhance student activities as well as modernize the existing, outdated library. The main office was also modernized and renovated to improve school security. In 2016, a new modern greenhouse and classroom was constructed behind the school to be used by Western's STEM academy the Environmental Studies Academy (ESA). In 2017, two history classrooms and two English classrooms (all together in a quad) were renovated to promote Albemarle County's Global Studies concept where the history and English classes are intertwined. In summer 2018, a total renovation and addition of science labs began. Opening in fall 2018 was the school's new Tri-Lab, a large, open multi use space to the building. This space consisted of two classrooms and a hallway that were all connected by knocking down walls and modernizing the whole room. Throughout the 2018–19 school year and summer 2019, construction continued on the new science addition that would soon be known as the E-Wing. During summer 2019, all of the school's existing science labs were renovated and modernized. These rooms, along with the new E-Wing, opened to students at the beginning of the 2019-20 school year.\n\nIn January 2008, it was announced that Western was one of two schools (along with Murray Elementary) in the County that received the Governor's Award for Educational Excellence. This was the highest honor in the new incentive program for schools and school divisions created by the Board of Education to advance Governor Tim Kaine’s “competence to excellence” agenda.\n\nAlso in 2008, the school was ranked 1310 of 1358 of the top 5% of U.S. high schools by Newsweek, placing it in the 9th percentile of school quality. It is also ranked in the top 10 of the state of Virginia.\n\nWestern Albemarle's athletic department has been awarded the Wells Fargo Cup (formerly the Wachovia Cup) five times (2004, 2005, 2008, 2018, and 2019). The cup is awarded annually to one school in each of the VHSL's six divisions that demonstrates the best-overall record in state championship competitions. WAHS broke the record for most points ever scored towards the cup in 2019. The school is a member of VHSL's Class 3 in the Jefferson District.\n\nThe boys' soccer team won its fourth state championship in 2019, with other championships coming in 1996, 2014, and 2016.\n\nThe girls' soccer team won their second and third state championships in 2017 and 2018, with the first in 2002.\n\nIn football they have been three-time Jefferson District champions.\n\nIn 2011, the Western Albemarle track team sent several relay teams to the national track competition. In 2018, the Boys and Girls Indoor Track teams also won the state championship.\n\nIn 2004–2005, the school won 21 district, regional, and state championships.\n\nCombined, the boys and girls swimming and diving teams have won ten state championships, with the girls winning from 2011-2016, and in 2019, and the boys winning in 2016, 2018, and 2019.\n\nIn 2017, the boys' and girls' cross-country teams both won the state championship.\n\nWestern Albemarle's quizbowl team placed second at the 2014 PACE NSC In 2014 they also won the VHSL Scholastic Bowl 3A title as well as the NAQT Virginia state championship.\n\nWAHS hosts the Destination ImagiNation tournament for the Jefferson District.\n\nIn 2006, a 16-year-old Western Albemarle High School student and a 15-year-old Albemarle High School student were arrested after it was discovered that they were plotting to detonate explosives at their schools. The students were both found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to use explosives to destroy a school house, and have been committed to the juvenile justice system.\n\n"}

It is owned by Grupo Clarín.\n\nAs mentioned by its name, it broadcasts on VHF channel 13 in Buenos Aires, where the main station is located.\n\nChannel 13 was founded in 1960, and started broadcasting on 1 October 1960, at 8:30 p.m. The channel was tendered to the company Rio de la Plata S.A. TV, founded by Cuban businessman Goar Mestre and the US network CBS. In the mid-1960s, Editorial Atlántida and Mestre's wife bought the shares of the channel. Since then, Channel 13 began to compete strongly with the other two open private channels of the city of Buenos Aires, Channel 9 and Channel 11, which had gone through a similar process.\n\nIn those years there were great successes in the Argentine television industry, with Channel 13 broadcasting \"Viendo a Biondi\" (\"\"Seeing Biondi\"\"), a comedy show centered on characters by Pepe Biondi; \"The Falcón Family\" starring Pedro Quartucci, and sketch comedy shows such as \"Telecataplum\", featuring an innovative group of Uruguayan comedians including Ricardo Espalter, Enrique Almada and Gabriela Acher, among others.\n\nIn 1974, the government of Isabel Perón nationalised the station along with two other terrestrial private channels of Buenos Aires (Channel 9 and Channel 11), in order to bring a media policy based on the European way, where television was largely managed by the government.\n\nAfter 15 years as a government-owned station, on December 1989, Artear, a company with majority ownership by Artes Gráficas Editorial Argentino S.A (AGEA), publisher of the Clarín newspaper and part of its multimedia conglomerate, officially took over the station management.\n\nSince then, the channel is positioned as the second in TV ratings in Buenos Aires, competing against Telefe. In the 1990s, achieved great ratings, thanks to political comedy programs Tato Bores, programs of cultural and \"La aventura del hombre\", TV series La Banda del Golden Rocket, \"Montaña Rusa\" \"Gasoleros\" and the series \"Campeones de la vida\" and \"Poliladron\".\n\nSince 1996, the channel operates with Pol-ka Producciones, owned by actor and producer Adrian Suar, who in 2001 became program manager of the channel.\n\nIn 2000, its brand name was changed to Canal Trece (literally \"Channel Thirteen\").\n\nIn 2002, the network started a new trend, which consisted on renewing its aesthetic graphical package every year.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Channel 13 remained in second place on TV ratings.\n\nIn December 2005, Artear bought 30% of shares from Ideas del Sur.\n\nIn January 2009, the channel rebranded itself with another graphical package, but kept its logo. In April of that year, after several failed attempts, Channel 13 launched its own international channel (El Trece Internacional), which is broadcast in over 20 countries via subscription television. Between 24 and 26 March and 5 May 2009, Artear's satellite feeds (which included Channel 13's satellite feed, \"El Trece Satelital\") suffered unusual interferences. Although the opposition lawmakers blamed the Cristina Fernandez left-wing administration, the anomalies were finally determined to be caused by a Mexican broadcasting company.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, Channel 13 managed to defeat Telefe and rank first in the general audience average, a situation that had not happened in 20 years, driven largely by the high audience of reality show \"Showmatch\", added to the very good performance of Telenoche, the daily shows \"Malparida\", \"Los únicos\" y \"Herederos de una venganza\", entertainment programs \"Sábado show\", \"La cocina del show\" and \"A todo o nada\" and the fourth season of \"Este es el show\". In 2012 the station returned to second place, remaining in that position as of 2019.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, the channel's highlighted programs were telenovelas \"Malparida\", \"Herederos de una venganza\", \"Los Únicos\", \"Sos mi hombre\", \"Solamente vos\", \"Farsantes\" and \"Guapas\", TV shows \"Para vestir santos\", \"El puntero\" and \"Tiempos compulsivos\", entertainment programs and newscasts like \"Showmatch\", \"Este es el show\", \"Sábado show\", \"El diario de Mariana\", \"Periodismo para todos\", \"A todo o nada\" and \"Los 8 escalones\" and its reality shows \"Soñando por bailar\", \"Soñando por cantar\" y \"Cuestión de peso\". With this programming, the channel scored second place in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\nTinelli remained as the main figure of the channel during this decade. He was absent from \"Showmatch\" in 2013, when he decided to take a sabbatical year after having finished his contract with Channel 13. In that year he was about to move to Telefe, in the middle of an operation led by the Kirchner left-wing government through businessman Cristóbal López, to harm Grupo Clarín. The businessman that mostly controlled Canal 13 during this decade was Guido Kaczka (), who led programs such as \"A todo o nada\", \"Los 8 escalones\", \"Dar la nota\", \"La mejor elección\", \"Hacelo feliz\", \"Las puertas\" and \"La tribuna de Guido\".\n\nIn March 2014, after 34 years, Mirtha Legrand returned to Channel 13 starring in \"Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand\" (which airs on Sundays at 1:30 p.m.) and \"La noche de Mirtha\" (Saturdays at 10:00 p.m.).\n"}

The 2 ringside judges split their votes and the tie was broken by the referee, who gave it to Louis, to the protest of a substantial part of the audience, who had been won over by the fact that Godoy showed no fear of Louis and by the additional fact that Louis was not able to knock out his opponent after a string of K.O.s and T.K.O.s. South Americans and Chileans in particular thought that Godoy had indeed won the fight and from then on the figure of Godoy acquired mythical proportions.

Separation of the two pubic bones during delivery at the symphyseal joint is extremely rare. Typically, during the birthing process, there is a sound that can be heard by the human ear to detect that there could be a case of symphysis. There is a pain that is associated with symphysis that can make simple everyday tasks truly unbearable. A few of the medical techniques that are used to fully confirm a diagnosis of symphysis are \"radiography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.\" Unfortunately, many overlook their pain that they experience after delivering their child, and just account the pain as postpartum which delays the diagnosis and treatment for symphysis.\n\nThe common cause of this disorder is when there is a high energy event that is occurring like vaginal child birth. Sometime symphysis is known as \"Floating Pubic Symphysis (FPS).\" treatments for this disorder include \"external fixation, subcutaneous fixation, internal fixation, and percutaneous cannulated screw fixation.\" this problem must be resolved immediately because it can cause other problems like \"hemorrhagic shock and rectal, urogenital, and vaginal injuries\".\n\nOften, patients with pubic symphysis diastasis are able to benefit from non-operative procedures to heal them and take away their pain. Unfortunately, when the non-operative procedures prove to be unhelpful, the doctors have to resort to surgical procedures to ease the pain and fix the problem. Even though this illness is extremely rare, there have been treatments that have been discovered.\n\nThis disease doesn't only occur within postpartum mothers. Many athletes experience symphysis when they are playing in their sports fields. The symptoms include groin pain and increased pain when participating in weight bearing activities. Even without proof or diagnosis of a hernia, there can be major pain and soreness experienced in the air of the symphysis.\n\n"}

A number of examples were built as one type and converted to another during their lifetimes. The DGA-11, powered by a nine-cylinder Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engine, was purportedly the fastest four-seat civil aircraft of the late 1930s, able to achieve a top speed of about . A favorite of the high society and Hollywood circles, the DGA-11 cost about $16,500 in 1938. These aircraft were a direct developments of the famous Howard racing plane \"Mister Mulligan\". Designer/pilot Ben Howard's \"DGA\" prefix stood for \"Damned Good Airplane\".\n\nThe DGA-6's racing success brought the DGA series much attention, and in its various permutations, differentiated mainly by different powerplants, the DGAs -8, -9, -11, -12 (and later DGA-15) emerged as coveted aircraft, owned by corporations, wealthy individuals, and movie stars, such as Wallace Beery, who was himself a pilot. Spanish conductor and pianist Jose Iturbi owned and flew a DGA-11 \"El Turia\" (NC22402). In an era when airlines were flying DC-3s, the Howards at 160 to could match their speed and range. The rear seat exceeded airline leg room with limousine-like spaciousness. With its high wing loading, the Howards rode through most turbulence with airline-like solidity. The -11 was probably the ultimate of the series. Configured as a four-place aircraft, with the Pratt & Whitney R-985, it is graceful and powerful with perfectly classical lines.\n\nWith America's entry into World War II, most of the civilian Howards were commandeered by the military. The Army used them as officer transports and as ambulance planes. They were used variously as an officer's utility transport and for instrument training. The Howard was and is an excellent instrument platform, very stable and solid, especially compared to modern light aircraft.\n\nA number of these aircraft still fly, and another example of a DGA-11, restored by Jim Younkin, can be seen in the Arkansas Air & Military Museum.\n\n\n\n"}

Costa Brava stretches from the town of Blanes, northeast of Barcelona, to the French border.\nIn the 1950s, the Costa Brava was identified by the Spanish government and local entrepreneurs as being suitable for substantial development as a holiday destination, mainly for package holiday tourists from Europe. The combination of a very good summer climate, nature, excellent beaches and a favourable foreign exchange rate (before the creation of the single European currency), which made Costa Brava an attractive tourist destination, was exploited by the construction of large numbers of hotels and apartments in such seaside resorts as Blanes, Tossa de Mar and Lloret de Mar. Tourism rapidly took over from fishing as the principal business of the area.\n\nThe coast was named \"Costa Brava\" by in an article published in the Catalan newspaper \"La Veu de Catalunya\" in September 1908. Agulló, a journalist born in Girona, referred to the rugged landscape of the Mediterranean coast which runs from the River Tordera, near Blanes, to Banyuls with the name \"Costa Brava\". \"Costa\" is the Catalan and Spanish word for 'coast', while \"Brava\" means 'rugged' or 'wild'. This term was officially recognized and promoted in the 1960s as it was deemed suitable to promote tourism in the region. Before Costa Brava became the official name, other names were suggested, such as \"Costa Grega\" (Greek Coast), \"Costa del Corall\" (Coral Coast), \"Costa Serena\" (Serene Coast), \"Costes de Llevant\" (Levant Coasts) or \"Marina de l'Empordà\" (Empordà Marine).\n\nIt may or may not be a coincidence that the name \"Costa Brava \"resembles \"Costa Blava \"(the Catalan designation of the French Riviera), which is a literal translation of the Spanish \"Costa Azul\" (\"Blue Coast\"). This in turn is a not-quite-literal translation of the French \"Côte d'Azur \"(\"Azure Coast\"); \"azul\" has the same etymology as \"azur\", but it is the general Spanish term for blue, not specifically azure. A direct translation from French to Catalan would have yielded \"Costa d'Atzur\".\n\nIts coastline includes three comarques:\n\nBut its toponymy includes two more: \n\nThe province of Girona is within Catalonia, it covers an area of 5,885 square kilometres and is situated in the extreme northeast part of the Iberian Peninsula, between 41°40′ and 42°30′ latitude and 5°27′ and 7° longitude east. The western border is a broken line that separates it from the province of Barcelona. The coastal strip is its eastern border, which extends along 158 linear kilometres (85 nautical miles) or 256 kilometres of the intricate profile of the Costa Brava.\n\nThe Generalitat de Catalunya defines the Costa Brava as the coastal region that stretches from the Franco-Spanish border to the mouth of the River Tordera, marking the border of the provinces of Girona and Barcelona. Portbou is the closest town to the border while its Blanes marks its southernmost point. The Costa Brava Girona Tourism Board, a body of the tourism industry of the Province of Girona, promotes the brand name \"Costa Brava\" as an area of . By this definition, Costa Brava includes the coastal \"comarques\" of Alt Empordà, Baix Empordà, Selva and the inland \"comarques\" of Pla de l'Estany and Gironès.\n\nThe northernmost part of the Costa Brava belongs to the \"comarca\" of Alt Empordà, and is marked by the Albera Massif and Cap de Creus, the easternmost prolongation of the Pyrenees. This area near the frontier is marked by rough terrain and cliffs, with small bays along the coast, in contrast with the large plains of the Alt Empordà region, where its capital Figueres is located. The first town from the border with France is Portbou, which grew around the railway station. A little down the coast are the seafaring villages of Colera and Llançà. North of the Cap de Creus lies the town of El Port de la Selva, while on its south lie the towns of Cadaqués and Roses. To the south of the Cap de Creus is found the Gulf of Roses, which stretches for fifteen kilometres with beaches and marshlands formed by the Muga and Fluvià rivers, with the protected areas of the Aiguamolls de l'Empordà along the coast. Empuriabrava, part of the municipality of Castelló d'Empúries, is one of the largest marinas in the world, built in the 1960s on the marshlands of the River Muga. Further south lies the town of Sant Pere Pescador and the coastal town of L'Escala. Between this two towns is the village of Sant Martí d'Empúries, which lies near the ruins of the ancient Greek colony of Empúries, founded in 575 BC.\nThe central part of the Costa Brava belongs to the \"comarca\" of Baix Empordà, whose capital is La Bisbal d'Empordà, with the Montgrí Massif extending on its north, from L'Escala to the village of L'Estartit, part of the municipality of Torroella de Montgrí. The River Ter pours its water at this point, near a small archipelago known as Medes Islands. Further south, following a stretch of beach and marshlands, are the towns of Pals, Begur and Palafrugell. At this point the Gavarres Massif meets the sea, with a coast marked by rugged cliffs, small bays and beaches amid coastal villages such as Aiguafreda, Fornells, Tamariu, Calella de Palafrugell and Llafranc. The town of Palamós, further south, is a major commercial and fishing port. At this point the coast forms a bay between Palamós and Sant Antoni de Calonge, part of the town of Calonge. South of it lies the town of Castell-Platja d'Aro, including Platja d'Aro, a large tourist resort which has grown along a wide beach. Situated to the south are S'Agaró and the town of Sant Feliu de Guixols, which lies to the north-east of the Ardenya Massif.\n\nThe southernmost part of the Costa Brava belongs to the \"comarca\" of Selva, whose capital is Santa Coloma de Farners, about from the Mediterranean Sea. Tossa de Mar is located to the north of the coastline, with several resorts and small bays along the littoral. Lloret de Mar, located to the south of Tossa, is the largest resort on the Costa Brava, with a population of over 200,000 at its peak during the summer. Blanes is the southernmost town on the Costa Brava and is the third most populous municipality of the Province of Girona.\n\nIn the middle of the Costa Brava, about inland from the Mediterranean Sea, lies Girona, the capital of the comarca of Gironès and the Province of Girona. The city has a population of almost 100,000 and lies at the confluence of the Onyar, Güell, Galligants and Ter rivers. Ten kilometres north of Girona is Banyoles, the capital of the \"comarca\" of the Pla de l'Estany, on the shore of the Lake of Banyoles. Both the Gironès and the Pla de l'Estany are the inland \"comarques\" of the Costa Brava.\n\nThe main rivers that pour their waters into the Costa Brava are:\n\nThe climate of Costa Brava is typically Mediterranean, mild and temperate, characterised by hot, dry summers and moderately cold winters. The annual average temperature ranges from 7 to 28 °C, while the highest temperatures are recorded in the months of July and August.\n\nUntil after the First World War, the beaches along the coast of Catalonia served for Sunday leisure pursuits for the local people, plus one or two from neighbouring villages. While world tourism had discovered the Côte d'Azur by that time, the Costa Brava remained unknown to it.\n\nA few years after the Spanish Civil War when some sort of order had been restored, the gradual breaking down of Spain's international isolation in the 1950s cleared the way for new options in tourism. The sea and the sun were drawing increasing numbers of people, which combined with the Côte d'Azur already being overcrowded in those days, enhanced the appeal of Costa Brava for holiday-makers who made their way there.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Costa Brava was identified by the Spanish government and local entrepreneurs as being suitable for substantial development as a holiday destination, mainly for package holiday tourists from Northern Europe and especially, the United Kingdom and France. The combination of a very good summer climate, nature, excellent beaches and a favourable foreign exchange rate was exploited by the construction of large numbers of hotels and apartments in such seaside resorts as Blanes, Tossa de Mar and Lloret de Mar. Tourism rapidly took over from fishing as the principal business of the area.\n\nWhile part of the Costa Brava coastline lent itself to tourist developments on a very large scale, other parts have retained a more traditional look. Small towns like Cadaqués, which is close to the French border and close to the foothills of the Pyrenees, have attracted artists, such as Salvador Dalí, Joan Miró and Pablo Picasso. The Dalí Theatre and Museum in Figueres is one of the most important and visited museums in Catalonia. One can also visit Dalí's House-Museum in Port Lligat, near Cadaqués and the Castle of Púbol in Púbol. The coast between Roses and Tossa de Mar has many delightful small coastal towns, such as Pals, Begur, Tamariu, S'Agaró, Empuriabrava, Llafranc, L'Estartit, Aigua Blava, Fornells, Calella de Palafrugell, Calonge, Palamós and Sant Feliu de Guíxols.\n\nThe great artistic collection is a set of nearly fifty museums and collections listed among the five counties that make up the name of the Costa Brava. From north to south:\n\nCatalonia has two official languages, Catalan and Spanish. Most of the local population habitually speak Catalan, and all the population understand and can express themselves perfectly well in Spanish.\n\nWith the creation of the single European currency, the euro has been in effect since January 1, 2002.\n\nAs in most European countries, in winter the time is an hour ahead of GMT and two hours ahead in the summer.\n\nThe working day usually starts between 08.00 and 09.00 and lasts until 14.00. In the afternoon, companies usually open from 16.00 to 19.00.\n\nLunch is usually eaten between 13.30 and 15.00 and dinner between 20.30 and 22.00. At weekends, these times are usually slightly later. Most restaurants adapt to the customs of tourists.\n\nOpening times of bars are long and varied. The law permits bars to open until 2.30 from the night of Monday/Tuesday to the night of Thursday/Friday and until 3.00 from the night of Friday/Saturday to Sunday/Monday and on bank holidays. However, each bar adapts its opening times to the area in which it is found and the characteristics of the premises. Whilst cafeterias cover needs during the working day, night time bars usually open from 17.00 and stay open for as long as they are allowed to.\n\nOpening times of businesses vary according to their function and size. Small shops normally open between 09.00 and 10.00 and close between 20.00 and 21.00. On the other hand, the large department stores and hypermarkets open continuously from 10.00 to 22.00. On Sundays, businesses are shut, except at certain times of the year (over the Christmas holidays and at sales time). Sometimes smaller establishments close for an extra half day, often a Monday morning.\n\nBanks are usually open from 8.30 to 14.00 Monday to Friday. Banks also open on Saturday mornings from 08.30 to 13.00, except in the summer. From October to June, savings banks open on Thursday afternoons from 16.30 to 19.45.\n\nOfficial administrations and town councils usually work straight through from 08.00 to 15.00, Monday to Friday.\n\n\nIn addition to these, and through an order from the Ministry of Employment, there will be two local festivals, to be paid and not recoverable, at the proposal of the respective municipalities.\n\nPablo Casals, Manuel de Falla and Isaac Albéniz are some of the great figures who have left their mark on the Costa Brava. However, one of the first music festival organisers was Josep Ensesa, who opened the doors and gardens of Senya Blanca, his house in S'Agaró, to music lovers in 1956 with a series of concerts christened the International Music Festival. The success of this festival led other Costa Brava towns to host similar events and nowadays almost all the towns on the Costa Brava hold annual musical events.\n\nMusic forms part of the character of many towns and of the several events held by them over the course of the year. However, it is in the summer when emblematic venues such as gardens, covered squares, cloisters, monasteries or waterside venues host internationally renowned musical and cultural events. These summer events showcase all kinds of music, including classical music, pop and rock, havaneres (colonial sea shanties) and Catalan sardana music.\n\nBut there are a number of festivals in Costa Brava that stand out above the rest in terms of their history, originality or colour. These include the procession \"Dansa de la Mort\" (Dance of Death) in Verges on Maundy Thursday and the Dance of Death, with characters donning skeleton outfits dancing in the streets, the living Way of the Cross in Sant Hilari Sacalm, the floral carpet festival in Arbúcies, the Hobby Horse dance in Sant Feliu de Pallerols, the \"Ball del Cornut\" and \"La Plantada de l'Arbre\" (The Planting of the Tree) of May in Cornellà del Terri... not to mention the major music festivals, some of them internationally renowned, such as Peralada Castle, Cap Roig Garden Festival in Calella de Palafrugell and Torroella de Montgrí festivals, which draw world-class performers, as well as opera and contemporary music figures.\n\n\nThe Costa Brava has been a source of inspiration for many writers. This is clear to see in the countless books dedicated to the area and the thousands that have been written here. Josep Pla, Federico García Lorca, Truman Capote, Salvador Espriu, Joan Maragall and Caterina Albert are just some of these famous writers.\n\nOver the course of its history, especially over the last one hundred years, the Costa Brava has been the birthplace and place of residence of artists from various disciplines. Several political, intellectual and social figures have passed through or stayed on the Costa Brava, which has contributed to transforming it and boosting its profile both at home and abroad.\n\nArtists and actors in particular have helped to give the area a glamorous image. Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Orson Welles, Yves Montand and Douglas Fairbanks all graced the Costa Brava with their glamour, as did Salvador Dalí, Marc Chagall, Dani Karavan (sculptor of the monument to Walter Benjamin in Portbou), Ramon Pichot and many others.\n\nThe Costa Brava was a natural film set where producers find the charm that inspires them to create stories starring world-famous actors. Artists also find inspiration for their works and the peace and quiet necessary to produce them.\n\nFrom the early days of cinema, the Costa Brava featured in many films, which has proved on many occasions to be an added value in boosting its profile as a tourist destination even further. The attraction of the Costa Brava for local producers and filmmakers from the local area and from Catalonia in general is perfectly understandable given its geographical proximity and its highly interesting yet easily accessible locations of all kinds.\n\nIt has also proved a popular location with Spanish and foreign studios and directors, who have filmed high-profile films in the area with stellar casts and production values. The commercial success and media buzz created by these productions has made certain locations known all over the world.\n\nSant Feliu de Guíxols was the most popular location in the counties of Girona for cinema producers and the second-most popular in all Catalonia (after Barcelona). These results are logical enough: the Costa Brava is a potent area full of beauty and diversity, located close to the historical city of Girona with an old quarter that holds a huge amount of visual possibilities.\n\nGastronomy plays an important role of the Costa Brava. Anchovies from L'Escala, prawns from Palamós, monkfish from Roses, blue fish from Sant Feliu de Guíxols, rock fish from Begur or skate from Tossa de Mar represent the sea, while turnips from Campmany, onions from Vilabertran and Figueres, rice from Montgrí, beans and peas from Vall d'Aro and apples from Girona represent the land in an elegant fusion of sea and mountain that constitutes the Costa Brava cuisine. However, the gastronomic richness of the Costa Brava is not restricted to its cuisine.\n\nOver 2,500 restaurants throughout the counties of Girona welcome diners with a cuisine based on a combination of quality seafood and the best produce of the land.\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, Girona province had become one of the main centres of gastronomic pilgrimage in the world. It is no secret that the creation and transmission centre of avant-garde cuisine is now El Bulli restaurant on Cap de Creus, on the northern stretch of the Costa Brava. Cap de Creus was formerly a centre of surrealism in the days when Salvador Dalí resided in the nearby coastal locality of Portlligat. The innovative cuisine at El Bulli first influenced Catalonia, then the rest of Europe, and finally the whole world. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, El Bulli decided to reinvent itself as elBulliFoundation with the aim of perpetuating the legacy of Ferran Adrià. Starting in 2014, introduction to Girona Cuisine the new foundation will disseminate the skills, research, innovation and all future developments coming out of the sanctuary of creativity in the heart of today's Cap de Creus Nature Park. Girona province has always been home to good cooking: such pioneering cuisine could not have arisen without a historical background, local products and raw materials coming from local agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, olive production, stockbreeding, fishing and sausage-making expertise. Nothing was missing. It just took one small step forward to reinvent our traditions. And the Roca brothers exemplify an evolutive fusion between avant-garde world cuisine and their hundred-year-old family tradition at El Celler de Can Roca, a restaurant that has made major contributions to technological innovation and to culinary and gastronomic techniques. All this goes to prove that Girona province is and has always been a powerful focus of gastronomic creation.\n\nEl Bulli makes its last appearance in 2011 Red Michelin Guide, when in the province of Girona lists 20 Michelin stars for 14 restaurants. In the same year the World's 50 Best Restaurants list El Bulli (Cala Montjoi) and El Celler de Can Roca (Girona) in the top five. \nAt 2012, 11 restaurants with 15 Michelin stars: five restaurants with six stars are found along the Costa Brava. And in 2012, El Celler de Can Roca is second in the World's 50 Best Restaurants.\n\nThe wines of Alt and Baix Empordà fall under the auspices of the DO Empordà regulatory body. Wines have been grown in the region for over 2,500 years, but in the middle of the 20th century, the quality declined greatly in favor of producing cheap, bulk wines aimed at visiting beach tourists. A focus on quality returned to the winemaking due to smaller wineries opening, starting in the mid-1990s. Now, the wines from the region have been subject to high scores and recognition from international critics and have even become the focus of guides created solely for enotourism.\n\nFor red varieties, Carignan (legally required to be 'Samsó' on the label) is prevalent, forming the basis of Empordà viniculture, together with Grenache (sometimes known in Empordà as \"Lledoner\"). These traditional varieties are complemented by new ones that are being introduced: Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, and Marselan.\n\nThe most popular white varieties are Grenache Blanc, Grenache and Macabeo. Muscat, Xarel·lo recently planted Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer grapes are also grown, but to a much lesser extent.\n\nIn 1998, the coastal towns of the Costa Brava signed a charter, called the \"Carta de Tossa\", which undertook to pursue environmental protection, along with tourism. This recognised the value of the region's wide range of natural habitats and microclimates. The Medes Islands off the coast of L'Estartit are in Spain's first marine reserve and provide a home to a wide range of fish and aquatic flora. The nearby wildfowl reserve on marshlands at Aiguamolls de l'Empordà also saved land from the potential ravages of development.\n\nThree Parks are present in the geography of the Costa Brava.\n\nProtection law in this area becomes the Cap de Creus Natural Park, located north of the Costa Brava, in Port de la Selva, one of the most unusual in the Iberian Peninsula. Determined as protected areas the municipalities of El Port de la Selva, La Selva de Mar, Roses, Cadaqués, Palau Saverdera, Pau and Vilajuïga, with an area of 13,886 hectares spread over 10,813 hectares of land and 3,073 of maritime space.\n\nLocated in north of the Costa Brava, between the towns of Castelló d'Empúries-Empuriabrava, Sant Pere Pescador and Roses, this park is the second largest of its kind in Catalonia, as a great number of native species flora and fauna. It is divided into two areas, north and south of the River Muga, comprising the characteristic elements of the landscape of the Alt Empordà.\n\nLocated in the interior of the southern part of the Costa Brava, in Arbúcies (Selva), Montseny Massif is the largest and highest part of the Catalan pre-coastal mountain range, straddling the provinces of Barcelona and Girona. One of the main values of the massif lies in the extreme variability of environments presents significant result of altitudinal gradients and vegetation and the diversity of its relief. Oak and pine forests, forests of cork oaks, oaks and beech trees are some of the shape almost a forest landscape while serving as a refuge for many animal species typical of environmental contexts of higher latitude.\n\nMore than 30% of the total surface of Girona consist of protected areas of special natural interest:\n\nDeclared area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, includes the towns of La Jonquera, Rabós d'Empordà, Espolla, Cantallops, Vilamaniscle, Garriguella, Mollet de Peralada and Sant Climent Sescebes. \nThe landscape presents with one of the largest concentrations of megalithic monuments in Catalonia, with small Romanesque churches that make this area one of the most rich heritage and history of the surrounding region of the Alt Empordà. And the Albera Massif presents transition vegetation between the species of the Pyrenean mountains and the Mediterranean, as well as fauna, characterised by great diversity, between the mountain areas and the wetland Catalonia.\n\nThis area of great landscapes and geology covers the whole of the coast called the Lake of Banyoles, which separates the plains of the Empordà and the Transversal mountain in the region of Garrotxa. Lake of Banyoles, with an area of 107 hectares and a feature-eight, is one of the largest in the Iberian Peninsula. The most important lakes of this system are its origin and source of the feed water through seepage of rain in some parts of the Garrotxa through subterranean flows caused his departure abroad. Lake of Banyoles and the collection of small ponds, present throughout the year and chemical processes of thermal stratification. In addition to these features, concentrated around the lake a wide variety of flora and fauna lake.\n\nThe small archipelago of the Medes, located in the heart of the Costa Brava, in the town of Torroella de Montgrí (Baix Empordà) and close to the mountain of the same name, is composed of seven islands that are characterised by rich its marine ecosystem. The proximity of the coast and the River Ter these islands provide a great amount of organic matter, allowing the variety of flora and fauna typical of the Medes. Some examples of this variety are the colony of gulls, the peculiar terrestrial vegetation, algae or coralline seabed, where you can go diving so regulated.\n\nLocated between the districts of Alt and Baix Empordà, this limestone massif separates the bays of Roses and Ter, and provides interesting elements of ecological diversity to the landscape. This wild and inhospitable nature makes an exception of the area of the Costa Brava. This area is occupied mainly by pine trees and weeds, in addition to the vegetation that appears not only in forested environments, but throughout the eastern fringe of the mountain, the sea. In this regard include Ferriol and Pedrosa coves, among others.\n\nThe Marine Reserve of Ses Negres, located in Begur, in the middle of the Costa Brava stretches over 1,300 metres of coastline, including beaches of Sa Riera and Aiguafreda. It has a total area of 80 hectares, which includes the cliffs that surround the mountains of Begur. Buoys and beacons define the protected area and also indicate a navigation channel of limited speed. In the bathing area and apnea, respectful and activities compatible with conservation of the environment, there is a recovery of marine life, years after being declared the reserve.\n\nMassive features typically Mediterranean. Located between the counties of Girona and Baix Empordà, is the northernmost of the Catalan coastal mountains. The landscape of this area is mainly forest. The nature of Mediterranean forest gives ample importance to the overall bulk comprised mainly holm and cork oaks. The fauna is typical of Mediterranean environments and forest. With regard to heritage, from the days with abundance of megalithic funerary monuments, in addition, the area also includes the medieval defensive buildings and religious buildings pre-Romanesque and Romanesque style.\n\nThe island of River Ter is a natural area of great ecological value for its biodiversity and for its potential as a setting for environmental education, both for students and for all those who love nature people who visit, where it is favoured because of its proximity to the city of Girona. The area is protected by municipal regulations and by the condition Wildlife Refuge. Presented botanical species of interest, the bell winter woods and some in excellent condition as they have been free from human interference natural setting of the island from the confluence the rivers Ter and Onyar.\nThis fauna, include the otter, genet and various species of butterflies typical of aquatic environments, and a variety of birds such as night heron, the kingfisher and lesser spotted woodpecker, among others. In total, about 200 species have been observed.\n\nThe Cadiretes Massif (or the bulk of Ardenya) is a natural area that occupies almost the whole town of Tossa de Mar and part of Sant Feliu, Santa Cristina d'Aro, Llagostera, Vidreres, Caldes de Malavella and Lloret de Mar. It is a mountainous terrain, granitic between the sea and the plains of the forest, the highest point of which is Puig Cadiretes (519 metres). The depressions are irrigated by mountain streams typically Mediterranean regime. However, the nature of the terrain makes it create upwelling of water throughout the year, along with humidity and precipitation caused by the screen effect of the mountains before the winds making the bulk elements converge of botanical and faunal clear Atlantic. The coast, with more than six kilometres protected is particularly abrupt, which has facilitated the establishment of several important species which have found an ideal retreat.\n\nThe bulk of Guilleries is located at the northern end of the ridge just behind and beyond the Montseny, the town of Sant Hilari Sacalm is the capital. The massive mountain range old and worn, covered with thick vegetation, has a total area of 12,500 hectares and is located within the Plan of Natural Interest (PEIN). A succession of peaks, form a unique landscape, thick, quiet and wild. The highest point is St. Michael the Ants, with 1,204 metres.\n\nCounting beaches and hidden coves surrounded by vegetation, there are 199 such locations in the coastal regions of Costa Brava.\n\n\n\nIn the four botanical gardens on the Costa Brava come together as many native plants typical of tropical plants, which in turn are balconies overlooking the Mediterranean:\n\nIn Calella de Palafrugell (Palafrugell, Baix Empordà), the species most characteristic of the Mediterranean mixed with trees and plants from five continents in this botanical garden, one of the most varied of Catalonia. During the summer, the botanical garden hosts a variety of activities such as exhibitions and cultural performances.\n\nThe Santa Clotilde Gardens are in a beautiful landscape on a cliff with views of the sea in Lloret de Mar (Selva). This botanical garden was designed in 1919 by Nicolau Maria Rubió Tudurí, and is characterised by the Italian influence and the formal coherence between the garden and the architectural surroundings. The gardens host several marble sculptures and are characterised by the absence of flowers, contrasting sharply with the wide variety of plants.\n\nIn Blanes (Selva), Ferdinand Rivière Caralt created in 1954 this botanical garden that has the peculiarity of having adapted to the Mediterranean and tropical vegetation characteristics. Plants and trees, such as cactus, Opuntia species or aloes, live in a context rich in native vegetation.\n\nThis botanical garden, located in the south-eastern slope of Mount Sant Joan de Blanes, on the cliffs, was created in 1921 by German scientist Karl Faust. Years later, Marimurtra became one of the most important biological stations in the Mediterranean. The Marimurtra Botanical Garden meets not only native plants and trees, but plant species from around the world, such as Chile palms, bamboos and trees characteristic of Africa and Mexico, among others.\n\n"}

He was convicted of committing war crimes during and Bangladesh Liberation War, despite his denial. The International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh sentenced him to death in February 2013 for crimes against humanity in the war of 1971 in a disputed decision. His crimes included genocide, mass murder, rape and arson. The tribunal received support within Bangladesh, but was criticized by many international observers. In September 2014 the Supreme Court commuted his sentence to life imprisonment.\n\nSayeedi was born in a village located in Indurkani, Pirojpur (Barisal Division of present-day Bangladesh). His father Yusuf Sayedee was an Islamic orator. Allama Sayeedi received his first primary religious education at his local village \"madrassa,\" which was built by his father. Sayeedi attended the Sarsina Alia Madrasah in 1962, followed by the Khulna Alia Madrasah. Sayeedi started a business in a local village market after completing his religious studies.\n\nLongstanding tensions between the eastern province of Bangladesh and the majority government based in western Pakistan gave rise in 1971 to the Bangladesh Liberation War. The ruling Pakistani elite, consisting of Punjabis and Pathans, thought that the Bengalis were inferior. The straw that broke the camel's back was the imposition of Urdu as the state language of Pakistan, a move which angered the already upset Bengali people. On 25 March 1971 Pakistan military started armed operation on unarmed Bengali people and killed hundreds of them in that night and the atrocities have been referred to as acts of genocide. The Pakistani Army along with Bihari Muslims migrants from India (Razakars who were hand in glove with Sayeedi and others like him) unleashed war crimes on the Bengali population. Post independence many such Bihari's now live in exile in Bangladesh while continuously seeking repatriation with (West) Pakistan.\n\nHis defence at the ICT trials, however, have alleged that this was a case of mistaken identity saying that Delwar Hossain Shikdar had been apprehended and executed by freedom fighters after the war. Before this, in the case of war criminal Abdul Quader Molla, who is also a leader of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, the same defence alleged that Quader Molla and ‘Koshai' Quader or ‘Butcher' Quader were not the same person. In both cases as shown here, the defence for lack of better evidence tried to work with the only recourse available to it; alternate names or aliases were the core arguments for the defence.\n\nHaving gained recognition, he was elected as a member of parliament for constituency Pirojpur-1 in the 1996 and 2001 national elections of Bangladesh.\n\nSayeedi is fluent in Bengali and Arabic.\n\nIn 2004, the United States of America Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) added Sayeedi to its No Fly List, established to prevent suspected radicals and terrorists from flying into the US.\n\nIn July 2006 Sayeedi travelled to the UK to address rallies in London and Luton; his entry was cleared by the foreign office. Many British MPs considered his admission to the country to be controversial. In leaked emails reported by \"The Times\", an adviser, Eric Taylor, said that Sayeedi's \"previous visits to the UK have been reportedly marred by violence caused by his supporters.\"\n\nOn 13 July 2006, the British journalist Martin Bright released a documentary called \"Who Speaks For Muslims?\" It included Sayeedi and identified him as having extreme views. Sayeedi has a large following within the British Bangladeshi community. He was invited to speak at the East London Mosque on 14 July 2006; the then-secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, Muhammad Abdul Bari, supported his invitation.\n\nOn 22 March 2012 the Bangladesh government established the International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh) to hear cases resulting from investigations of war crimes during the struggle for independence. It was an effort to \"provide justice for victims of atrocities in the 1971 war of independence.\" There had been longstanding accounts of abuses during the war, including forced conversion of Hindus to Islam, sectarian attacks on minority Hindu communities, raping of women, and attacks on unarmed civilians, among the excesses.\nOn 24 July 2009, immigration officials at Zia International Airport prevented Sayeedi from going abroad. He challenged the Government's restriction by filing a writ petition with the High Court on 27 July. The Attorney General stated before the Chamber Judge that \"Mawlana\" Sayeedi had opposed the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. He argued that if Sayeedi was not barred from foreign travel, he might work against the government's efforts to bring justice for war crimes during that conflict.\nHuman Rights Watch in November 2011 criticised the conduct of the ICT, suggesting that it has not provided enough protection for the defense of the accused. It has said that \"lawyers representing the accused before the ICT have reported being harassed by state officials and threatened with arrests.\" Several witnesses and an investigator working for the defense have also reported harassment by police and threats for cooperating with the defense.\"\n\"Human Rights Watch has long called for the ICT to establish an effective victim and witness program which would ensure protection for both prosecution and defense witnesses. Changes to the ICT rules in June 2011, which authorized the tribunal to ensure the physical well-being of victims and witnesses, were a welcome improvement, but did not go far enough, Human Rights Watch said.\"\n\nOn 12 August 2009, Manik Poshari filed a war crime case in Pirojpur against Sayeedi and four others. His accusations dated to events during the 1971 Bangladeshi war of independence.\n\nMahbubul Alam Howladar, a former freedom fighter, and now member and deputy commander of the freedom fighters association called \"Zianagor upazila Muktijoddha Sangsad,\" filed charges against Sayeedi with the Pirojpur senior judicial magistrate's court in Zianagar.\n\nThe war crime trials of Sayeedi began on 20 November 2011 at the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh. The tribunal charged him with twenty counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, rape and arson, during the liberation war. Some of the charges are\n(a) passing secret information on the gathering of people behind the Madhya Masimpur bus-stand to the Pakistan Army, and leading the Army there, where 20 unnamed people were killed by shooting;\n(b) abducting and killing of government officials (deputy magistrate – Saif Mizanur Rahman, sub-divisional police officer – Foyezur Rahman Ahmed, and sub-divisional officer – Abdur Razzak) of Pirojpur;\n(c) identifying and looting the houses and shops of people belonging to the Awami League, Hindu community, and supporters of the Liberation War at Parerhat Bazar under Pirojpur Sadar;\n(d) leading an operation, accompanied by Pakistan Army, to burn 25 houses of the Hindu community at Umedpur village (under the jurisdiction of Indurkani Police Station);\n(e) leading the group who abducted three women from the house of Gouranga Saha of Parerhat Bandar and handed them over to the Pakistan army for raping.\n\nSultan Ahmed Howlader, the fourth prosecution witness in the trial, testified that, during the liberation war, Sayeedi and his associate Moshleuddin confined Bipod Shaha's daughter Vanu Shaha at Parerhat, Pirojpur district and regularly raped her. Another witness testified that Sayeedi had organised the Razakar militia, a paramilitary force that aided the Pakistan army at Pirojpur.\n\nThe trial saw 28 witnesses for the prosecution and 16 for the defence. In addition, the tribunal received 16 witness statements given to the investigator after the prosecution argued that those witnesses were either dead, or that producing them before the tribunal would incur unreasonable delay or expenditure.\n\nOn 5 November 2012, Sukhranjan Bali, a prosecution witness who instead testified as a defense witness, was abducted outside the International Crimes Tribunal allegedly by the Bangladesh Police. Human rights group believed it to be a case of forced disappearance. Later, Bali was handed over to India's Border Security Force, and was sentenced to prison and tortured. \"The apparent abduction of a witness in a trial at the ICT is a cause for serious concern about the conduct of the prosecution, judges and government,\" said a spokesperson for Human Rights Watch. Bali had been expected to counter prosecution allegations about Sayeedi's involvement in the 1971 murder of Bali's brother.\n\nThe tribunal found Sayeedi guilty in 8 of the 20 charges, including mass killing, rape, arson, loot and force minority Hindus to convert to Islam during 1971. On 28 February 2013, the tribunal sentenced him to death by hanging for two charges among the eight committed during the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nAs per the verdict, Sayeedi was awarded capital punishment for the offenses as listed in charge Nos. 8 and 10. The court refrained from passing any separate sentence of imprisonment for the offences listed in charges Nos.6,7,11,14,16 and 19 which it said had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. At the same time, the accused was found not guilty to the offenses of crimes against humanity as listed in charges nos. 1,2,3,4,5,9,12,13,15,17,18 and 20 and was acquitted from the said charges.\n\n\"The Economist\" criticised the trial, stating that the presiding judge had resigned and Sayeedi's death sentence was handed down by three men who had not heard all the witnesses.\nThe trial was supported by European Union.\n\nThe defendant's lawyers boycotted the trial and have said that the charges against Sayeedi and others were politically motivated.\n\nSayeedi said the verdict was not neutral. The lack of evidence provided in the trial as well as the potential for political motivations for Sayeedi's arrest and conviction has led to rights groups like Amnesty International to question the legitimacy of the tribunal and conviction.\n\nBy afternoon on the day of the protest, clashes had erupted across Bangladesh between Islamic activists and police forces. An estimated 100 protesters died countrywide.\nAccording to the BBC, it marked \"The worst day of political violence in Bangladesh in decades\".\n\nOn 17 September 2014, the Appellate Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court reduced the sentence of Sayedi from the death penalty to 'imprisonment till death' for war crimes against Bengali people in Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.\n"}

The airport is the site of the command center for and primary facilities of the United States Coast Guard Air Station Humboldt Bay, which provides rescue and law enforcement for the region north of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe airport was built by the United States Navy during World War II to test defogging systems. It operated in support of the Naval Air Station Alameda as the Arcata Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) and was headquarters for the Eureka section of naval local defense forces for the 12th Naval District.\n\nIn December 1947 a Southwest Airways Douglas DC-3 made the world's first blind landing by a scheduled commercial airliner using Ground-Controlled Approach (GCA) radar, Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO) oil-burners next to the runway. By the following year the airline had made 1,200 routine instrument landings at the often fog-shrouded airport.\n\nThe airport covers at an elevation of .

The glare of the strobe lights that direct planes to the runway were a hazard for drivers, especially during rain when the strobes' intensity increased and the road reflected the blinking lights. Baffles were installed on the strobes which block the lights from shining on the road while still guiding aircraft.\n\nScheduled flights are on SkyWest Airlines (United Express) with 3 or 4 flights per day to SFO on CRJ-200s and Embraer 175s and 2 flights per day to LAX using the CRJ-200. \n\nDaily nonstop service to Denver International Airport began on June 7, 2019.\n\nService has increased over the last five years, with two new destinations (LAX and DEN); passenger departures have increased 56% since 2015. \n\nACV was served by Eureka Aero (mid-1970s) (Eureka, Crescent City), Air Oregon (early 1980s) (San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland, OR, Medford, OR, Eugene, OR, North Bend, OR), American Eagle (San Jose), Pacific Air Lines and predecessor Southwest Airways (San Francisco), Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) (San Francisco), Horizon Air (from 1994 to 2011) (Redding, Portland, Los Angeles and briefly Seattle), Delta Connection (2008–2010) operated by SkyWest Airlines (Salt Lake City), Hughes Airwest and predecessor Air West (Crescent City, Medford, San Francisco, Eugene, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle); Republic Airlines (1979–1986) (San Francisco); United Airlines (San Francisco), WestAir operating as United Express (San Francisco), and Arcata Flying Service (early 1980s) (Redding, Portland, and Oakland).

{"id": "2045884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045884", "title": "Purity of arms", "text": "Purity of arms\n\nThe code of purity of arms (, \"Tohar HaNeshek\") is one of the values stated in the Israel Defense Forces' official doctrine of ethics, \"The Spirit of the IDF\". It states that:\n\nThe \"Spirit of the IDF\", a text within the IDF's main doctrine, requires \"honoring the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish ... state\", referring to both \"the tradition of the Jewish People throughout their history\" and \"universal moral values based on the value and dignity of human life\". Jewish religious law does not directly determine IDF policy, and the IDF Doctrine Statement is not a religious document, but its underlying religious basis was articulated by Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren (1917–1994), who had served in the IDF as both paratrooper and chief chaplain.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Norman Solomon, the concepts of Havlaga (restraint) and purity of arms arise out of the ethical and moral values stemming from the tradition of Israel, extrapolation from the Jewish law, and the desire for moral approval and hence political support from the world community. Despite doubts when confronted by indiscriminate terrorism, purity of arms remains the guiding rule for the Israeli forces. These foundations have elicited a fair degree of consensus among Jews, both religious and secular.\n\nA notable proponent of this image is Colonel Richard Kemp, a retired British army officer, who called the IDF the most moral army in the world on Israel's Channel 2 News. In a 2015 document regarding Operation Protective Edge, published by Friends of Israel Initiative, the High Level Military Group, composed of military experts from Australia, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain, acknowledged that Israel made \"unprecedented efforts\" to avoid civilian casualties exceeding international standards.\n\nIn contrast, the 2015 report of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Operation Protective Edge, chaired by Mary McGowan Davis (a former New York state judge), voiced concerns that \"the fact that the political and military leadership did not change its course of action, despite considerable information regarding the massive degree of death and destruction in Gaza, raises questions about potential violations of international humanitarian law.\"\n\nIn combat and other confrontation situations several of the values within the Spirit of the IDF code are concomitantly evoked, such as:\n\nSelective targeting (or targeted killing) of terrorist leaders is considered by the IDF as a legitimate mode of operation and part of a state's counterterrorism, anticipatory, self-defense activities that are designed to prevent the continuation of terrorism. Selective targeting of terrorist activists is used as a measure designed to hurt the real enemy while minimizing civilian casualties. The practice was challenged before the Israeli Supreme Court, which held that while terrorists were civilians under the law of armed conflict, they were not protected by the prohibition in Article 51(3) of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which provides that civilians enjoy immunity from deliberate attack \"unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities\". The Court found that the meaning of both \"for such time\" and \"direct part in hostilities\" covered those providing services to unlawful combatants in any period before a potential attack; therefore terrorists did not qualify for this immunity, a ruling that has been accepted into international law.\n\nThe decision received a mixed reception from the international community, with one scholar expressing concern that it threatened \"to undermine international law's protection of civilians in armed conflict by shifting the balance toward military advantage and increasing the likelihood of collateral damage\".\n\nSome challenge the idea that the IDF is either particularly moral or follows the concept of \"Purity of Arms\", but according to Gideon Levy, the \"majority of the Israelis is still deeply convinced that their army, the IDF, is the most moral army of the world, and nothing else\".\n\nAccording to Avi Shlaim, \"purity of arms\" is one of the key features of \"the conventional Zionist account or old history\" whose \"popular-heroic-moralistic version of the 1948 war\" is \"taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad\". Benny Morris adds, \"[t]he Israelis' collective memory of fighters characterized by \"purity of arms\" is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages.\" According to him, \"after the war, the Israelis tended to hail the \"purity of arms\" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses. (...) This reinforced the Israelis' positive self-image and helped them 'sell' the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy.\"\n\nFollowing the Qibya massacre, Yeshayahu Leibowitz questioned the moral character of operations of the Israeli army. He pointed out that contrary to the time of diaspora, Jews established in Israel have the possibility to resort to force and that while in 1948 they may have had no choice, at Qibya the Israeli nation showed its moral limits.\n\nIsraeli Colonel Dov Yirmiah has referred to \"the lies about humanitarianism and 'purity of arms'\", and refers to purity of arms as a phrase that is \"sickening and false\". Dov's book \"My War Diary: Lebanon June 5 – July 1, 1982\" has been described as having \"crushed the myth\" of the purity of arms of the IDF.\n\nAccording to John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt the claim that the IDF is the most moral army in the world is \"yet another myth\".\n\nA former head of the Mossad, Zvi Zamir stated that the fact that Israel Defense Forces soldiers have shot at unarmed people on the Syrian–Israeli border showed the IDF's \"purity of arms\" was being eroded.\n\nSome rabbis oppose the stipulation of avoiding harm to non-combatants, arguing that Jewish law specifically rejects this requirement during wartime.

She was laid down on 10 November 1919 at Newport News, Virginia by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company; launched on 3 July 1920 and commissioned on 4 September 1920, Comdr. Harry M. Bostwick, USNRF, in command.\n\nFollowing shakedown, \"Trinity\" got underway from Chesapeake Bay on 11 February 1921, bound for the Mediterranean. She arrived at Valetta, Malta and delivered general stores for USS \"Pittsburgh\" (CA-4) before proceeding to Split, Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia), with fuel oil for American ships operating in the Adriatic. After a three-day layover at Split, she got underway on 8 March for Venice, where she arrived on 12 March. She eventually called at Pula (then in Italy, now in Croatia), before making port at Brindisi to take on fuel oil and general supplies for the naval base at Constantinople, Turkey, and American naval forces operating in Turkish waters. Following the delivery of this cargo, \"Trinity\" sailed to Gibraltar, then departed there on 4 April and arrived at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, on 17 April. Subsequently based at Norfolk, Virginia and assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, the oiler operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean until she was decommissioned on 22 December 1923 and laid up at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.\n\nShe remained there, inactive, until growing tension in both Europe and the Far East prompted the Navy to enlarge its building programs, and to recondition and recommission old ships. Accordingly, \"Trinity\" was re-commissioned at Philadelphia on 21 June 1938. She transported cargoes of oil from ports on the Gulf of Mexico to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal Zone.\n\nTransferred to the Pacific Fleet early in 1939, \"Trinity\" carried oil to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, for use by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In the summer, she turned her attention to the Far East and conducted voyages from ports on the [[West Coast of the United States and in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] to the [[Philippine Islands]], delivering fuel oil to storage facilities such as those on [[Sangley Point]], near [[Cavite]]. Late in 1940, the oiler was transferred to the [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic Fleet]].\n\nShe departed [[Manila Bay]] on 28 February 1941 to commence the first of eight round-trip voyages in that year to ports in oil-rich [[Borneo]] and the Netherlands East Indies. As war clouds gathered on the horizon in the summer of 1941, an organization plan was drawn up which designated \"Trinity\" as part of the Manila-based Task Force 2.\n\nAt the end of the eighth voyage, \"Trinity\" arrived at Manila on 3 December 1941. On 8 December, she lay alongside the fuel docks at Sangley Point, discharging oil to the storage tanks ashore, when she received word from Admiral [[Thomas C. Hart]] that \"Japan has commenced hostilities — govern yourselves accordingly.\"\n\nWith Japanese air attacks expected momentarily, Hart decided to send the two Navy oilers, \"Trinity\" and [[USS Pecos (AO-6)|USS \"Pecos\" (AO-6)]], and seaplane tender [[USS Langley (AV-3)]] south from Manila Bay. Later that day, these three valuable auxiliaries, shepherded by [[USS Pope (DD-225)|USS \"Pope\" (DD-225)]] and [[USS John D. Ford (DD-228)|USS \"John D. Ford\" (DD-228)]], departed in a hastily assembled convoy. Two days later, while the American ships sailed for Borneo, 80 Japanese bombers and 52 fighter planes attacked the American navy yard at Cavite, destroying it as a base for the Asiatic Fleet. \"Trinity\" had departed the area just in time.\n\nThe convoy reached [[Balikpapan]], Borneo, on 14 December; and \"Trinity\" now commenced her wartime operations with the hard-pressed [[United States Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic Fleet]]. After a one-month stay there fueling Allied warships, she steamed first to [[Koepang Bay]], [[Timor]], and then to [[Kebola Bay]], at [[Amor Island]], in the Netherlands East Indies. Standing out of Kebola Bay on 17 January 1942, \"Trinity\" set course for Australia, escorted by [[USS Alden (DD-211)|USS \"Alden\" (DD-211)]] and [[USS Edsall (DD-219)|USS \"Edsall\" (DD-219)]]. Shortly after 0630, a Japanese submarine fired three torpedoes at the oiler. All missed their target. \"Alden\" then searched for the enemy, made contact, and dropped a pattern of depth charges. In the resulting confusion, however, the American destroyer lost contact with the enemy and abandoned the search.\n\nUpon her arrival at [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], \"Trinity\" filled the depleted fuel bunkers of [[USS Holland (AS-3)|USS \"Holland\" (AS-3)]] and [[USS Otus (AS-20)|USS \"Otus\" (AS-20)]], the tenders to the Asiatic Fleet submarine forces operating in the Malay Barrier. [[USS Canopus (AS-9)|USS \"Canopus\" (AS-9)]] had been left at Manila Bay to provide for the Manila-based submarines.) When she had delivered this \"liquid gold,\" orders came for \"Trinity\", \"Otus\", and \"Holland\" to accompany [[USS Black Hawk (AD-9)|USS \"Black Hawk\" (AD-9)]] and four destroyers on a voyage to the south coast of [[Java (island)|Java]] to establish a base there.\n\nDropping anchor at the congested port of [[Tjilatjap]], she remained there a week before Vice Admiral [[William A. Glassford]], Commander, United States Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific (COMSOWESPAC), dispatched her to [[Iran]] to obtain refined fuel oil to relieve the critical fuel shortage in the war zone. Departing Tjilatjap on 17 February in company with \"Edsall\", she proceeded independently after her escort was ordered back to port and arrived at [[Abadan, Iran]], on 9 March.\n\nThe first United States warship in local memory to have visited this part of the world, \"Trinity\" gathered valuable intelligence material on local conditions in [[Iraq]] and Iran, including observations of the port-of-entry (Abadan) for war materials slated for use by the [[Soviet Union]]. She also collected oceanographic data on the [[Persian Gulf]]. After loading her vital cargo, she headed for [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] on 17 March.\n\nUnfortunately, Java fell even before \"Trinity\" arrived at her destination. Although Allied forces had been driven out of the [[Malay Barrier]], they gathered in Australia to begin building for the long road back. COMSOWESPAC retained \"Trinity\" for the Persian Gulf-Fremantle run, calling at such varied ports as [[Basra]], Iraq; [[Bahrein]], [[Arabia]]; [[Diego Garcia]], [[Chagos Archipelago]]; [[Bombay]], [[India]]; and [[Geraldton]] and [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]], Australia; as well as the now-familiar ports of Abadan and Fremantle. On one occasion, in November 1942, the ship encountered a typhoon in which heavy seas, whipped by winds, enveloped the ship and destroyed two motor whaleboats.\n\nIn 1943, with [[Papua New Guinea]] secured and the [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]]-[[Gona]] campaign successfully resolved, \"Trinity\" moved her base to [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]], where she arrived on 13 August 1943 and came under the control of Commander, Base Force, 7th Fleet. Attached to this command for the remainder of the year, \"Trinity\" [[Wiktionary:Ply|plied]] the Milne Bay-[[Brisbane]] route, while also touching at [[Cairns]] and [[Townsville]], Australia. When anchored at Milne Bay, she provided oil for miscellaneous Allied ships. She subsequently moved north to commence operations in the Buna-[[Cape Cretin]] vicinity, an area in which she remained until early March.\n\nDuring the next few months, she proceeded back to Milne Bay and thence to [[Port Moresby]] before heading for Cairns and completing the round trip to Milne Bay on 24 July 1944. Operating out of the New Guinea area, she worked as shuttle tanker and harbor feeder, anchoring at such places as [[Manus Island|Manus]] in the [[Admiralties]], [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]] and [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] on the north coast of New Guinea, and at [[Biak]] in the [[Schouten Islands]].\n\nBy January 1945, as the war progressed steadily towards the Japanese homeland, \"Trinity\" continued her unglamourous but vital job of plying the triangular New Guinea-Shouten Islands-Admiralty Islands route, shuttling cargoes of oil needed to keep the warships of the Fleet in operation. Arriving at [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], Philippines, in May 1945, she returned to waters from which she had been driven so unceremoniously in those dark days of December 1941. For the remainder of her active service, she operated in the western Pacific through the end of the war and the early months of the occupation.\n\n\"Trinity\" departed [[Samar (island)|Samar]] on 12 January 1946, bound for home. After stops at [[Eniwetok]] and [[Pearl Harbor]], she arrived at the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] on 22 February and reported to Commandant, 12th Naval District. The oiler remained there until decommissioned on 28 May. Struck from the Navy list on 3 July, she was delivered to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration on 5 September 1946. Sold to the [[Colonial Steamship Corp]]. in 1951, the veteran tanker was renamed \"Seabeaver\".\n\n\"Trinity\" received one [[battle star]] for her [[World War II]] service.\n\n\n[[Category:Patoka-class oilers]]\n[[Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia]]\n[[Category:1920 ships]]"}

Their showy, creamy-white or pink flowers are large, up to across, and are hard to miss. These flowers require exposure to sunlight to open up properly, and then last only a single day.\n\nThe unbranched stems of this plant are round and hairless, frequently growing to tall and sometimes taller. The root system includes a taproot.\n\nThe hairless leaves are alternate, long, divided into 3-5 pointed lobes (cleft) and have serrate or crenate edges. They are simple and pointed at the tip. The leaves with three lobes resemble a medieval halberd because the middle lobe is much larger than the two side lobes. The five-lobed leaves also look like halberds or daggers.\n\nFlowers are solitary or occur in small clusters at the tops of the upper stems. They are fairly large, about across when fully open. They are mostly white or light pink, but the inside throat of the flower is often maroon or a rich purplish pink color. Each flower has five petals with five hairless green sepals below. There are numerous stamens, all attached to a central column. The pistils have superior ovaries and five stigmas protruding from the central column in the flower. The fruit is an ovoid capsule containing many seeds.\n\nThe blooming period can occur from mid-summer to early fall (June to September) and lasts about a month. Each flower lasts only a single day. This plant spreads by reseeding itself. The stalks die down in the winter and grow back in the spring.\n\nThis plant prefers full or partial sun and moist conditions.

The term is distinct from buffer overflow, a condition where a portion of memory being used as a buffer has a fixed size but is filled with more than that amount of data. This requires the program or device reading from the buffer to pause its processing while the buffer refills. This can cause undesired and sometimes serious side effects because the data being buffered is generally not suited to stop-start access of this kind.\n\nIn terms of concurrent programming, a buffer underrun can be considered a form of resource starvation.\n\nThe terms buffer underrun and buffer underflow are also used to mean buffer underwrite, a condition similar to buffer overflow, but where the program is tricked into writing before the beginning of the buffer, overriding potential data there, like permission bits.\n\nBuffer \"underruns\" are often the result of transitory issues involving the \"connection\" which is being buffered: either a connection between two processes, with others competing for CPU time, or a physical link, with devices competing for bandwidth.\n\nThe simplest guard against such problems is to increase the size of the buffer—if an incoming data stream needs to be read at 1 bit per second, a buffer of 10 bits would allow the connection to be blocked for up to 10 seconds before failing, whereas one of 60 bits would allow a blockage of up to a minute. However, this requires more memory to be available to the process or device, which can be expensive. It assumes that the buffer starts full—requiring a potentially significant pause before the reading process begins—and that it will always remain full unless the connection is currently blocked. If the data does not, on average, arrive \"faster\" than it is needed, any blockages on the connection will be cumulative; \"dropping\" one bit every minute on a hypothetical connection with a 60-bit buffer would lead to a buffer underrun if the connection remained active for an hour. In real-time applications, a large buffer size also increases the latency between input and output, which is undesirable in low-latency applications such as video conferencing.\n\nBuffer underruns can cause serious problems during CD/DVD burning, because once the writing is started, it cannot stop and resume flawlessly; thus the pause needed by the underrun can cause the data on the disc to become invalid. Since the buffer is generally being filled from a relatively slow source, such as a hard disk or another CD/DVD, a heavy CPU or memory load from other concurrent tasks can easily exhaust the capacity of a small buffer. Therefore, a technique called buffer underrun protection was implemented by various individual CD/DVD writer vendors, under various trademarks, such as Plextor BurnProof, Nero UltraBuffer, Yamaha SafeBurn, JustLink, and Seamless Link. With this technique, the laser is indeed able to stop writing for any amount of time and resume when the buffer is full again. The gap between successive writes is extremely small.\n\nAnother way to protect against the problem, when using rewritable media (CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM), is to use the UDF file system, which organizes data in smaller \"packets\", referenced by a single, updated address table, which can therefore be written in shorter bursts.\n\nIf the framebuffer of the graphics controller is not updated, the picture of the computer screen will appear to hang until the buffer receives new data. Many video player programs (e.g. MPlayer) feature the ability to drop frames if the system is overloaded, intentionally allowing a buffer underrun to keep up the tempo.\n\nThe buffer in an audio controller is a ring buffer. If an underrun occurs and the audio controller is not stopped, it will either keep repeating the sound contained in the buffer, or output silence depending on the implementation. Such effect is commonly referred to as \"machinegun\" or Max Headroom stuttering effect. This happens if the operating system hangs during audio playback. An error handling routine (e.g. blue screen of death) may eventually stop the audio controller.\n"}
{"id": "2045920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045920", "title": "Bomb the Bass", "text": "Bomb the Bass\n\nBomb the Bass is an electronic music alias of English musician and producer Tim Simenon.\n\nAs a name, Bomb the Bass came from Simenon's approach to collaging and mixing sounds whilst DJing in the mid- to late 1980s; he says \"samples were either scratched in live or sampled and looped on top of the rhythm section. So the concept was one of bombing the bass line with different ideas, with a collage of sounds. Bombing was a graffiti term for writing, like people would 'bomb' trains or whatever.\"\n\nWhilst the bass line and drum tracks of \"Beat Dis\" were written by Simenon, the rest of the track was compiled from samples. Having already taken a part-time sound course at the School of Audio Engineering in Holloway, Simenon was able to build \"Beat Dis\" himself - assisted in the process by producer Pascal Gabriel, who would go on to experience his own success as co-producer of S'Express and a wide variety of other artists.\n\nAccording to the BBC, which featured \"Beat Dis\" on their clip-based \"TOTP2\" show, the track contains an alleged 72 samples, including lifts from hip hop like Public Enemy, funk (including The Jimmy Castor Bunch), and Ennio Morricone. Also featured were dialogue clips from the television shows \"Dragnet\" and \"Thunderbirds\". Talking to \"Sound on Sound\" magazine many years later, Simenon said of the track's construction: \"I suppose I was tuned in to what was current at the time and was able to pick and choose what I wanted with some knowledge of how it should be applied.\"\n\nHe co-produced Neneh Cherry's \"Buffalo Stance\" and, along with Trevor Horn, co-produced \"Krazy\", a remix of the song \"Crazy\" by Seal, which Simenon had originally mixed.\n\nThe Bitmap Brothers cooperated with Tim Simenon to include the 1988 Bomb the Bass hip hop track \"Megablast (Hip Hop on Precinct 13)\" as theme music for the computer game \"Xenon 2 Megablast\", which is also the origin of the game's subtitle. In turn, this song features many samples from Sly and the Family Stone song, \"You Can Make It If You Try\", and its theme seems heavily inspired by The Splash Band track \"The End (Disco Version)\" released in 1984, which is itself based on the theme of John Carpenter's film \"Assault on Precinct 13\".\n\nThere are two versions of the track in the game: a nearly faithful rendition (only missing a few spoken lines) as the loading music, and a simplified version as the in-game background music. The Amiga version of the loading music is based on the same track, but significantly different, with such changes as helicopter sound effects at the beginning and end.\n\nThe game was one of the first instances of a computer being programmed to play a pop single with reasonable accuracy. Sections of the music were sampled and then re-sequenced (by computer game musician David Whittaker). In the cartridge-based console versions, the music is radically simplified, being purely synthesized and lacking the voice samples of the computer versions.\n\nIn 1991, \"Love So True\" with vocals from Loretta Heywood was the first single of new Bomb the Bass material. It suffered under hastily imposed (and unofficial) censorship broadcast regulations, as the outbreak of the First Gulf War prompted UK broadcasters, especially the main national music station BBC Radio 1, to blacklist a variety of songs and acts deemed potentially controversial due to their content or titles. The band name Bomb the Bass was considered to fall into this category, along with that of Massive Attack.\n\nOnce again pioneering new sounds in the public arena, and following the success of \"Winter in July\", \"Unknown Territory\" would be the band's most well received release to date. Reviewing the album at the time, music writer and author Simon Reynolds attempted to outline a new genre in the making, suggesting that, by moving beyond mere dance tracks into fully cohesive albums, the band were venturing into \"progressive dance\".\n\nInterviewed for \"Sound on Sound\" magazine in 1995, Simenon agreed with the interviewer when it was suggested that, with this more frenetic side of his work, he was looking to \"combine the art of sampling with the energy of rock and roll.\"\n\nThe Gavin Friday album project, \"Shag Tobacco\", not only catapulted Friday into the mainstream (spawning the track \"Angel\" which found its way onto the hugely successful soundtrack of the \"Romeo & Juliet\" movie), but also caught the attention of a pair of British musicians on the look out for a new producer: Dave Gahan and Martin Gore of Depeche Mode. Says Gahan, \"There was loads of names being thrown at us (to produce Depeche Mode's next album after \"Songs of Faith and Devotion\"), but in the end we picked (Simenon) because Martin (Gore) and I really liked the Gavin Friday album that he did. \"Shag Tobacco\" is an absolutely brilliant album, (and) we really loved the sounds he produced\".\n\nThe resulting album, \"Ultra\", was released in April 1997. Quoted in the biography, \"Depeche Mode: Black Celebration\" by Steve Malins, Simenon confessed, \"I just felt f*cked by the end of the recording, and I carried on working in January and February 1997, which was the worst thing I could have done. I started to feel really ill. So I took a break and had a few months off. I was just mentally and physically exhausted\".\n\nThe work in question, which took the form of recording sessions with Jack Dangers from Meat Beat Manifesto would not surface for many years, leaving a further single with Depeche Mode, \"Only When I Lose Myself\" as the last major Simenon outing for many years: \"It'd been non-stop for more than 10 years, and I was just burnt out. It all just caught up, and took its toll; just left me feeling very, very uninspired\".\n\nThe \"Tracks\" EP was recorded in collaboration with Jack Dangers, from Meat Beat Manifesto, and the first actual Bomb the Bass material to be released via Electric Tones. With all tracks co-credited to \"Bomb the Bass & Jack Dangers\", the recording sessions were listed as having taken place years earlier, in 1998.\n\nIt was originally thought that \"Butterfingers\" (featuring Fujiya & Miyagi) would be the first single released from \"Future Chaos\", as an animated short film for the track surfaced on YouTube in March 2008. The clip, which was produced by Perish Factory visualizes the new minimal sound of the band by featuring an animated Minimoog - as used on the track.\n\nReviewing \"Butterfingers\", Daily Music Guide described it as showing \"\"the new Bomb the Bass plug straight into a place where scuffed Formica is sexier than leather, and red LED is the font of all knowledge. Having worked through all those zeroes and ones only to come up wanting, Bomb the Bass have seemingly gone back to come forwards once again, with the result being a track that easily lives up to the sum of its parts.\"\"\n\nBomb the Bass confirmed they would perform their first London gig in almost 20 years, at the London Astoria on 4 June 2008; and are also billed as appearing at the UK dance music festival, The Big Chill, on 2 August 2008, in Ledbury, Herefordshire and the Zürich festival, Lethargy '08.\n\nIn an online interview with Tim Simenon in May 2008, it was remarked that \"Future Chaos\" would finally be released in August 2008. In the same interview, Simenon commented that the album had taken so long to complete partly because he had wanted to change direction, to take on a more simplistic, less cluttered feel - necessitating a restart and re-record.\n\nIn September 2009, using Twitter, Simenon revealed that work was almost complete on the follow-up to \"Future Chaos\". Around the same time and also via Twitter, Jakeone of Toob announced he had just completed remix duties on a new track called \"The Infinites\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2045926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045926", "title": "Iron Mike", "text": "Iron Mike\n\nIron Mike is the \"de facto\" name of various monuments commemorating servicemen of the United States military. The term \"Iron Mike\" is uniquely American slang used to refer to men who are especially tough, brave, and inspiring; it was originally a nautical term for a gyrocompass, used to keep a ship on an unwavering course. Because the use of the slang term was popular in the first half of the 20th century, many statues from that period acquired the Iron Mike nickname, and over the generations the artists' titles were largely forgotten. Even official military publications and classroom texts tend to prefer the nickname to the original titles.\n\nQuantico’s Iron Mike is officially titled Crusading for Right. It depicts a World War I Marine holding a 1903 Springfield rifle, wearing a pack with a bayonet.\n\nAt the end of the war, US Army General John J. Pershing commissioned the French sculptor Charles Raphael Peyre (sometimes Raphael Charles Peyne) to commemorate the service of the US Army’s \"doughboys\". The sculptor, unaware of the differences between the branches of service, used a Marine private as a model and included the Eagle, Globe and Anchor insignia on the helmet. When Pershing saw the finished product, he insisted that the insignia be removed. The artist would not allow his work to be censored, so the army declined to buy the statue.\n\nFinally, Marine Corps General Smedley Butler raised enough money to buy the statue and had it installed in front of the headquarters building at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. The statue was begun in 1918 and first exhibited at the Exposition des Beaux Arts of the Grand Palaise des Champs-Élysées, in Paris in May 1919. Marine Officers and Enlisted donated money to purchase the statue, and it was sited in front of the Base Headquarters, Building 1019, in Quantico, Virginia, some 75 miles from DC and a bit off the tourist trail. Three tablets were erected in the memory of the officers and men of the 6th Machine Gun Battalion, 5th Regiment and 6th Regiment, United States Marines, \"who gave their lives for their country in the World War in 1918\" by the Thomas Roberts Reath, Marine Post No. 186, American Legion, on November 10, 1921. On December 8, 1921, the statue was dedicated.\n\nToday, a recreation of this statue stands in front of the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia. On that statue's base is the name \"Iron Mike\". The original statue remains in front of Butler Hall, home of the Marine Corps Training and Education Command.\n\nThe Iron Mike at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial at Belleau Wood battlefield is a bronze relief on granite, simply entitled The Marine Memorial. It was sculpted by Felix Weihs de Weldon, the artist who had earlier designed the giant Marine Corps War Memorial in Washington, D.C. The monument was erected in the heart of the forest to honor the 5th and 6th Marine Regiments of the 4th Marine Brigade which fought there for twenty days in June 1918. Dedicated on November 18, 1955, this Iron Mike is the only memorial in Europe dedicated solely to the United States Marines.\n\nBelow the statue is a commemorative plaque with a large Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. The plaque includes a brief history of the battle, with text in both English and French. The four ton monolith of bon accord granite, the same as used in the base of the Marine Corps War Memorial, came from Karlshamn, Sweden. Together with the seven foot tall Marine with bayonet, admired by the senior French present at its dedication as \"very powerful and forceful ... fully embodying the spirit of the Marines,\" and accompanying plaque, the monument weighs about .\n\nThe battle was the bloodiest of the U.S. Marine Corps' history at that point, and the 5th and 6th Regiments were awarded the French Fourragère and Croix de Guerre. Following the war, as noted on the plaque, the French government renamed the forest \"Bois de la Brigade de Marine.\" Officiating at the monument's dedication ceremony was then Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., who had fought and was wounded at Belleau Wood 37 years earlier. Also in attendance, were three other Marine General Officers who had also fought at Belleau Wood. Together the four Generals, Shepherd, William A. Worton, Gerald C. Thomas and Alfred H. Noble, made for a unique gathering of senior Marines in Europe.\n\nParris Island's Iron Mike is depicted carrying a Maxim machine gun over his right shoulder and an M1911 pistol in his raised left hand, created as a memorial to all of the Parris Island graduates who were killed during World War I.\nThe statue itself is approximately life-sized, standing about high from the heel of his boot to the muzzle of his pistol, and is mounted on a granite base. It was created by Robert Ingersoll Aitken, the sculptor of the pediment on the United States Supreme Court Building, and cast in bronze. Officially entitled Monument to U.S. Marines, this Iron Mike was dedicated in 1924 in a ceremony presided over by Commandant John A. Lejeune. Due to changes and construction around Parris Island, Iron Mike was relocated in 1941 and it now stands in front of the Parris Island Headquarters and Service Battalion Barracks.\n\nThe bronze plaque, mounted on the base, reads: \"In memory of the men of Parris Island who gave their lives in the World War, erected by their comrades.\"\n\nFort Bragg’s The Airborne Trooper is the newest Iron Mike statue. Known as the \"Home of the Airborne,\" Fort Bragg hosts the 82nd Airborne Division as well as the XVIII Airborne Corps. Sculpted by Leah Hiebert in 1960 and 1961, using Sergeant Major James Runyon as a model, the statue depicts a World War II-era Airborne trooper with a Thompson submachine gun at the ready. The vision of former XVIII Airborne Corps Commander, Lt. Gen. Robert F. Sink, the statue was not named for any one man or unit, but rather dedicated to all paratroopers; past, present and future. Omar Bradley, Matthew Ridgway, Anthony McAuliffe, Maxwell Taylor, Thomas Trapnell, and William Westmoreland were among the fifteen generals who attended the dedication ceremony. Originally installed at the southern entrance on Bragg Boulevard, the \"Airborne Trooper\" was moved to the traffic circle in front of the post headquarters in 1979 to prevent vandalism and increase visibility. ()\n\nFort Bragg’s original Iron Mike stood tall from boot heel to the top of his helmet and weighed . The original statue was made from polyester strips dipped in epoxy and stretched over a steel frame. Due to deterioration, it was replaced in 2005 with a bronze version. The original was refurbished and was moved to the Airborne & Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, North Carolina on June 14, 2010. ()\n\nA digital model of the original was created and used as a guide for the new version to ensure faithful replication of Hiebert's design. A ceremony to dedicate the new version was held September 23, 2005.\n\nPresident George W. Bush spoke in front of the statue on July 4, 2006.\n\nA replica of \"The Airborne Trooper\" stands above the bridge at La Fiere in Normandy, where on June 6–9, 1944 members of 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment and 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, both elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, fought a fierce battle against repeated German attacks. The small stone bridge over the Merderet River was a key point for the Germans to take in order to break up the American landing at Utah Beach, while at the same time being key to the Americans so that they could expand their beachhead in Normandy. Over the course of the battle, the Germans attacked the lightly armed Americans with both infantry and armor but were never able to cross the bridge. The monument was unveiled on June 7, 1997.\n\nThe University of Minnesota's Twin Cities campus also has a statue known as \"Iron Mike\". Designed by Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson and installed in 1906, the statue stands in front of the armory at 15 Church Street. Also known as the \"Student Soldier Memorial\", this Iron Mike is a monument to alumni who served in the Spanish–American War. The statue is tall and stands on a granite base, depicting a soldier clad in a period uniform with a campaign hat and a Krag-Jørgensen rifle.\n\nThe actual name of the sculpture is The Hiker. Thirty-nine copies of Kitson's \"Hiker\" are still in existence, spread across the United States from Deering Oaks Park in Portland, Maine to Capitol Park in Sacramento, California. The University of Minnesota's \"Iron Mike\" is one of the oldest \"Hikers\" in the U.S., possibly rivaled by one in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nThere are many other similar statues throughout the United States, most of them World War I monuments. The most well-known is a sculpture by Ernest Moore Viquesney entitled \"Spirit of the American Doughboy\". While the original statue design itself never received the nickname \"Iron Mike\", residents of some of the locales in which the copies can be found refer to their local monuments as such.\n\nThe U.S. Army Infantry Center at Fort Benning has a World War II monument entitled \"Follow Me\". It is often mistakenly referred to as \"Iron Mike.\"\n\nFort Lewis, Washington, is home to a statue entitled \"The Infantryman\", which is often referred to as \"Iron Mike\". Located at Tacoma Avenue and 41st Division Road (since 1992), and set with a backdrop of Mount Rainier, the statue was erected in 1964 to memorialize the soldiers of the 4th Infantry Division. Its design, an early Vietnam-era U.S. infantryman equipped with the M14 rifle, was inspired by the \"Iron Mike\" at Fort Bragg, and is made from the same fiberglass-on-iron as the original there. Despite a history centered on infantry training, it was the first monument on Fort Lewis dedicated to the infantryman.\n\nIn 1935 the \"Spirit of the CCC\", later nicknamed \"Iron Mike\", was the first major statue honoring the Civilian Conservation Corps. Designed by Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project sculptor, John Palo-Kangas, the statue was typical of the art-deco style of that period. Unveiled by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at CCC Company 1917 in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, California, the original statue has since disappeared, but was replaced in 1993 with a bronze reproduction sculpted by Jim Brothers.\n\nMarine Corps Logistics Base Barstow has a ridge that is used during training that is nicknamed \"Iron Mike\" due to the steepness of the terrain and determination it takes to run up without stopping. Another running course at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Camp Horno, shares the name as well.\n\n\n"}

It is generally surrounded by one or more sulci (depressions or furrows; sg. \"sulcus\"). Gyri and sulci create the folded appearance of the brain in humans and other mammals.\n\nThe gyri are part of a system of folds and ridges that create a larger surface area for the human brain and other mammalian brains. Because the brain is confined to the skull, brain size is limited. Ridges and depressions create folds allowing a larger cortical surface area, and greater cognitive function, to exist in the confines of a smaller cranium.\n\nThe human brain undergoes gyrification during fetal and neonatal development. In embryonic development, all mammalian brains begin as smooth structures derived from the neural tube. A cerebral cortex without surface convolutions is lissencephalic, meaning 'smooth-brained'. As development continues, gyri and sulci begin to take shape on the fetal brain, with deepening indentations and ridges developing on the surface of the cortex.\n\nChanges in the structure of gyri in the cerebral cortex are associated with various diseases and disorders. Pachygyria, lissencephaly, and polymicrogyria are all the results of abnormal cell migration associated with a disorganized cellular architecture, failure to form six layers of cortical neurons (a four-layer cortex is common), and functional problems. The abnormal formation is commonly associated with epilepsy and mental dysfunctions.\n\nPachygyria (meaning \"thick\" or \"fat\" gyri) is a congenital malformation of the cerebral hemisphere, resulting in unusually thick gyri in the cerebral cortex. Pachygyria is used to describe brain characteristics in association with several neuronal migration disorders; most commonly relating to lissencephaly.\n\nLissencephaly (\"smooth brain\") is a rare congenital brain malformation caused by defective neuronal migration during the 12th to 24th weeks of fetal gestation resulting in a lack of development of gyri and sulci.\n\nPolymicrogyria (meaning \"many small gyri\") is a developmental malformation of the human brain characterized by excessive folding of the gyri and a thickening of the cerebral cortex. It may be generalized, affecting the whole surface of the cerebral cortex or may be focal, affecting only parts of the surface. Polymicrogyria may be caused by mutations within several genes, including ion channels. \n\n\n"}

According to the February 1, 1984 timetable, the airline had a daily morning BAC One-Eleven nonstop to Sacramento continuing to San Francisco, Bakersfield and Santa Barbara. Other airlines included American Eagle, Reno Air Express and WestAir which flew smaller turboprops such as the BAe Jetstream 31 mainly to San Francisco or San Jose.\n\nService flown by SkyWest Airlines operating as United Express with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias nonstop to San Francisco ended on December 2, 2014. The airport now has no scheduled passenger air service.\n\nPacific Express was based in Chico, but ceased all flight operations in early 1984. Pacific Express flew to 22 cities in California, Nevada, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington with BAC One-Elevens and Boeing 737-200s. The airline had ordered new BAe 146-200s but never took delivery. Several of these BAe 146s were acquired by Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA). Pacific Express briefly had a code sharing agreement with Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) when the airline operated as Pan Am Pacific Express.\n\nThe City of Chico built a small airport on of land north of the city in the late 1930s and leased the facility to a fixed-base operator. The airport was expanded in 1941 to help serve the needs of the United States military, on 11 September 1941, when the City Council of Chico signed a lease with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (representing the War Department) for the use of of land at $1 per year with an option to buy. The City also provided all utilities and service roads to the field. Between four and five million dollars were allocated for construction of all needed facilities in a very short time, as at other bases. Eventually 140 buildings as well as runways, aprons and service roads were built.\n\nChico Army Airfield was under the command of the 10th Army Air Force Base Unit, AAF West Coast Training Center, Army Air Forces Training Command. Chico AAF also had five auxiliary landing fields:\n\nOn 15 April 1942 the first cadre of permanent troops who managed the field moved in. The field was opened as the Chico Army Flying School on April 15, 1942. The first cadets arrived on April 25, 1942 from Moffett Field where they had completed part of their basic flying in addition to their primary training. Basic training at Chico began on July 28, 1942.\n\nAn all black company was assigned to the Field in August 1942. The first WACs arrived in October 1943. A cadre of black WACs was housed on an eleven-acre site across Cohasset Road from the Field. WASPS (Women's Army Service Pilots) frequently delivered planes to the field. At its peak Chico Army Air Field had about 4,000 personnel. In the first two years, it trained 5,500 cadets and thousands of ground personnel.\n\nIn April 1944 the mission of the Field was changed from basic flying training of cadets to training of fighter pilots. An April 24, 1944 the Field was transferred from the Western Flying Training Command to the IV Fighter Command.\n\nThe new command brought in pilots who had completed their basic and advanced training and received commissions prior to coming to Chico. Here they were to be taught tactics of combat flying using Bell King Cobra (P-63) planes, later switching to the twin-engine Lockheed P-38 Lightings. These were all propeller planes. In May 1945 jet training was introduced on the P-59 jet trainers, and in July the P-51 `Mustangs. On August 25, 1945 IV Fighter Command was replaced by the 21st Bombardment Wing. Its function was to process both personnel and aircraft for overseas assignment. In October 1945 the Wing was redesignated the First Staging Command. Now the planes being processed were B-29 Superfortress bombers and crews.\n\nChico Army Air Field was deactivated on December 31, 1945. The property was excessed and transferred by the U.S. Army to the General Services Administration (GSA) for disposal. The lease on 1,045.3 acres was terminated on June 8, 1948. The lease termination agreement included the transfer of all U.S. Government constructed improvements to the City of Chico. GSA transferred the 10.97 acres to the City of Chico by deed dated January 28, 1949. The total acreage disposed was 1,056.27.\n\nOn 30 January 1959 the Air Force announced plans to conduct surveys in the vicinity of Beale Air Force Base to determine the feasibility for missile bases. A Titan-I ICBM was located on the north side of the airport from 1962–1965, part of Beale AFB's 851st Strategic Missile Squadron system of several ICBMs centered around Marysville. Its formal designation was Beale 851-C. The last missile was lowered into the Chico complex 4C on April 20, 1962.\n\nThe Chico missile complex had two accidents in 1962. On 24 May during a contractor checkout, a terrific blast rocked launcher 1 at the complex, destroying a Titan I and causing heavy damage to the silo. On 6 June trouble again struck as a flash fire at another silo killed a worker. After the investigation, the Air Force concluded that the two separate explosions occurred because of a blocked vent and blocked valve. The silo was repaired and put back into operational service. Today, the site has all three launch silos capped, but some development has taken place on the launch area with a retention pond, some trees, and some single-story buildings being erected. It appears to be in use for some type of quarrying/grading material which is transported to construction sites in the Chico area.\n\n\n"}

It was first described by the French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril and his assistant Gabriel Bibron in 1841, and is named after Charles Darwin, who had previously discovered it in Chile during his world voyage on HMS \"Beagle\".\n\nThe most striking feature of this frog is the tadpoles' development inside the vocal sac of the male.\n\nDarwin's frog is a small species with a snout–to–vent length of . The snout is elongated into a fleshy proboscis which gives the head a triangular shape. The limbs are relatively long and slender. The front feet are not webbed, but some of the toes on the back feet usually are.\n\nThe upperparts of this species are variably coloured in brown or green. Some brown individuals may have weakly defined V-shaped markings on the back, have central upperparts that are distinctly lighter brown than the flanks, or have whitish front limbs. Females are typically brown and tend to stay on substrates that match this colour. Males are far more variable and occur on a wider range of substrates; especially brooding males often are partially or completely green above. The throat is brownish and the remaining underparts are black with large white blotches in a pattern that is unique to each individual.\n\nDarwin's frog feeds on insects and other arthropods. It not only has to hunt, but also needs to hide from its predators. It relies on camouflage to avoid predators, lying on the ground looking like a dead leaf until the predator passes by. Another defensive position is turning on the back and exposing the boldly patterned ventral surface.\n\nThe female Darwin's frog lays up to forty eggs among the leaf litter. The male guards them for about three to four weeks until the developing embryos begin to move, and then he ingests the eggs and holds them in his vocal sac. They hatch about three days later and he continues to carry the tadpoles around in his vocal sac where they feed off their egg yolks and secretions produced by the wall of the sac until metamorphosis. At this stage, about 6 weeks after being swallowed (a duration in which the adult male eats nothing), the small frogs hop out of the male's mouth and disperse.\n\nDarwin's frog is found in Chile and Argentina. In Chile, its range extends from Concepción Province to Palena Province and in Argentina from Neuquén Province and Río Negro Province. It is found in glades and forested areas at altitudes of up to about above mean sea level. It is also found in bogs and near slow-moving streams. It is found in a variety of vegetation types and it appears that a mixture of grassland, mossy areas, coarse woody debris, and young trees and bushes in a mature native forest provides its optimum habitat requirements. Short vegetation increases the retention of water while decreasing the temperature of the soil and provides concealment from predators. The population is fragmented and this frog has poor dispersal ability.\n\nDarwin's frog has undergone significant population declines due to habitat loss and degradation, largely from conversion of native forests to tree plantations. The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, caused by \"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\" fungal infection, is also a probable factor, \"particularly from the northern part of their historical range\". Populations on Chiloé Island were found to be considerably more abundant than on the mainland.\n\nSince 2018, the species is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. A 2013 study reported results of a population survey conducted from 2008–2012, which found the species at just 36 of 223 previously recorded habitat sites, with small populations at those sites. The recent change in its conservation category in IUCN from Vulnerable to Endangered, arose from the Chile's amphibian reevaluation workshop for the Red List (Soto-Azat et al., 2015). The justification for its current category is due to its limited occupation area (estimated at 264 km2), severe fragmentation of its populations and continued decline.\n\nDue to its decline in the wild, captive colonies have been established as a precaution at two zoos in Chile, the National Zoo (working with the US Atlanta Botanical Garden) and Concepción Zoo (working with the University of Concepción and Germany's Leipzig Zoo).\n\n\n"}

It did not belong to the German Confederation of Trade Unions until it became part of ver.di, the united trade union for the services industry, in 2001.\n\nThe DAG was founded in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt in April 1949 when the employees' associations in the three western zones of Germany joined together. The first employees' union associations were registered in the middle of the 19th century. In the Weimar Republic, up to one hundred different employees' associations joined up to form three main employees' federations: the social democratic AfA Federation (\"AfA-Bund\"), the liberal Union of Employees (\"Gewerkschaftsbund der Angestellten\") and the Nationalist Christian Grand Association of German Employees' Unions (\"Gesamtverband der deutschen Angestelltengewerkschaften\"). The DAG considered itself as a successor to the employees' federations which existed until they were broken up by the Nazis in 1933.\n\nThe DAG established itself as a career-oriented employees' union independent of any political party. It did not belong to the German Confederation of Trade Unions and was a leading independent political organisation which influenced the \"Bundestag\" and the Cabinet of Germany in the interests of its members. One effect it had in the 1950s was to restore choice to the individual as concerned social insurance and to ensure that nearly all German employees had social insurance.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the DAG had a lasting effect on the wage system for employees and influenced their qualifications. It ran training centres, making it one of the largest providers of employee training in West Germany. Its functions were strictly divided into official and voluntary ones following a decision at the national congress in 1957.\n\nIn 1998, the DAG had 485,225 members, with about 55% being women.\n\nIn 2001 the DAG merged with four unions of the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DPG, HBV, ÖTV, IG Medien) becoming the ver.di, the united trade union for the services industry.

The supporting cast features Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo, Cloris Leachman, and Bonnie Hunt, among many others. The plot follows four women who recount a pivotal summer they shared together as adolescents in 1970.\n\nIt was filmed largely in the Country Walk subdivision off Coffee Bluff Road in Savannah, Georgia (called Shelby, Indiana in the movie), using the Gaslight Addition and Old Town Cemetery, highlighting the downtown area. Additional filming was done in Statesboro, Georgia in locations including the Bulloch County Court House (also featured in the film \"1969\") and the building now housing the Averitt Center for the Arts.\n\nOn July 18, 2012, it was announced that ABC Family would develop the film into a television series by I. Marlene King, who wrote the film and adapted \"Pretty Little Liars\", but the project did not move past the development stage. Upon release, the film received mainly unfavourable reviews but was a moderate financial success, grossing $37.5 million on a $12 million budget.\n\nSet in modern-day, four childhood friends, anti-social sci-fi author Samantha \"Sam\" Albertson (Demi Moore), glitz and glamour-loving actress Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell (Melanie Griffith), dry humored gynecologist Dr. Roberta Martin (Rosie O'Donnell), and content homemaker Chrissy DeWitt (Rita Wilson), reunite in their small Indiana hometown of Shelby, to support Chrissy, heavily pregnant and expected to give birth to her first child any day. Narrated by Sam, the story focuses on the summer of 1970, when the group, lead by her twelve-year-old self (Gaby Hoffmann) sought to earn enough money to purchase a tree house to place in the backyard of Chrissy's parents' home in their affluent suburban neighborhood, called the Gaslight Addition, and how they overcame major personal struggles, Sam in her parents' divorce and her mother's subsequent dating, Teeny (Thora Birch) in her pursuit of stardom and good looks, Roberta (Christina Ricci) in overcoming the death of her mother and the embarrassment she experiences due to her developing breasts, and Chrissy's (Ashleigh Aston Moore) naivety about sex and life in general due to her mother's overprotective nature. Also, the girls, motivated by Sam's interest in the occult, regularly participate in seances, and that summer in particular, they focused on contacting the spirit of young man whose gravestone read simply \"Dear Johnny,\" who died 25 years prior, in 1945.\n\nThe story flashes back to 1970 when the girls had two goals: saving enough money to buy a treehouse and avoiding the Wormer brothers. One night, they sneak out to the cemetery to perform a seance. A cracked tombstone convinces them they have resurrected the spirit of a young boy identified only as Dear Johnny, who died in 1945 at the age of 12. Intrigued, they search for information at the library but find nothing.\n\nLater, while heading for the library in a nearby town, the girls spy the Wormer brothers skinny-dipping in the lake. To retaliate for a prank the boys played on them, the girls steal their clothes, tossing them onto the road while riding off. At the library, Roberta discovers an article about her mother being killed in a car accident: she was hit head on, trapped in the car for an hour, and then later died of massive head trauma and internal bleeding- facts previously unknown to her. Samantha finds an obituary that briefly mentions Dear Johnny and his mother tragically dying, but many pages are missing, leaving the cause of their deaths a mystery.\n\nWhile riding back to their town, the girls encounter a hitchhiking Vietnam veteran. The girls ask him questions about the war and his time there, he is predominantly evasive and tells them their parents aren’t always right- something that Samantha loudly agrees with.\n\nThe girls then visit local psychic Wiladene, who determines Dear Johnny was murdered. On their way home, the girls meet up with local neighborhood kids at a pick up game of softball. A local boy insults Roberta who begins fighting him; after the fight is broken up, the boy insults Roberta’s deceased mother and Samantha tackles him to begin fighting again.\n\nSamantha goes home and unexpectedly meets Bud Kent, a man her newly single mother invited to dinner for their first date. Samantha is stand offish to Bud who accidentally spills wine on his shirt; Samantha’s mother gives Bud one of Samantha's father's old bowling shirts he had left behind. Upset, Sam storms out and flees to Teeny's house where she is on the roof of her house watching Love Story at the next door drive-in theater. They hang out in the treehouse display at the store, where Samantha confesses her parents are getting divorced. Teeny comforts her, then breaks her favorite necklace in two, giving one half to Samantha as a \"best friends for life\" bracelet. On their way home during a thunderstorm, Samantha loses her bracelet in a storm drain. When she climbs down to retrieve it, the water rises, trapping her. Crazy Pete, a local old man who only comes out at night to ride his bicycle, pulls her out. He asks them why they’re afraid of him, and after they tell him it’s creepy that he only comes out at night, he says he prefers not to be around people. Grateful for his actions, the girls now see him differently. At the same time, Roberta is playing basketball in her driveway when Scott Wormer suddenly arrives. They briefly play ball, and question why they fight all the time before sharing a kiss. Later, adult Samantha notes that Roberta has stopped taping her breasts after this happened. \nThe girls consult Samantha's grandmother about Dear Johnny's death. Her grandmother declines to discuss the murders, saying it took her a long time to forget about that tragedy. After her grandmother leaves with friends to play bingo, Samantha and the others climb through a window to get into the attic where Samantha's grandfather had collected and saved old newspapers. They discover from a newspaper article that Johnathan Simms and his mother Beverly Anne Simms were shot and killed when they interrupted a burglary; father and husband Peter Simms came home to find the bodies. Roberta becomes upset and angry that two innocent people were killed and that her mother died violently, contrary to what she was told. Samantha announces that her parents are getting divorced, and the girls make a pact to always be there for one another.\n\nTo put Dear Johnny's soul to rest, the girls go to the cemetery to perform another seance. His tombstone suddenly rises surrounded by bright light. A figure appears from behind, but it is only the groundskeeper who chastises the girls for \"playing\" in the cemetery and explains that the tombstone was damaged and is being replaced and he was the one who cracked it. Realizing they never resurrected Dear Johnny, they agree to stop the seances. While leaving, they notice “Crazy” Pete, and Samantha follows him back to the tombstone. Realizing that he is Dear Johnny's father, Peter Simms, she comforts him, while he advises her not to dwell on things. Some time after, the treehouse is finally bought, and Samantha narrates, \"The treehouse was supposed to bring us more independence. But what the summer actually brought was independence from each other.\"\n\nThe film returns to 1991, and Chrissy goes into labor and gives birth to a baby girl. Later, in their old treehouse, Roberta reveals that Crazy Pete died the previous year. They then discuss how happy they are in life and make another pact to visit more often.\n\n\nThe film was released on October 20, 1995 and was critically panned. Its plot was considered overly familiar, sitcomlike, and too similar to \"Stand by Me\". Based on reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, it received a 32% approval rating by critics, with an average score of 4.81/10, based on 19 reviews. Despite the critical response, it was acclaimed by audiences and has garnered a large cult following since its release.\n\nColumbia Records released a soundtrack album on October 17, 1995. It was made up of tunes from the 1960s and 1970s. Although appearing in the film, Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin'\" does not appear on the soundtrack. Two of the songs are anachronistic for a story set in the summer of 1970: \"\"Knock Three Times\"\" was released in 1971, and \"\"I'll Be There\"\" was released on August 28, 1970, so that it would only have gotten airtime on the radio after the summer vacation was over.\n\n\nVarèse Sarabande issued an album of Cliff Eidelman's score on October 24, 1995.\n\n\n"}

Also known as Boley Field, it is mostly used for general aviation, but has scheduled passenger service from one commercial airline. Service is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.\n\nThe airport is located one nautical mile (2 km) south of the central business district of Imperial, California, partially in the City of Imperial and partially in an unincorporated area of Imperial County. It serves nearby communities, including El Centro.\n\nAs per the Federal Aviation Administration, this airport had 7,061 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 5,641 in 2009, and 4,752 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"non-primary commercial service\" airport.\n\nThe first scheduled passenger airline flights were operated by Western Airlines with Douglas DC-3s with service beginning during the late 1940s. Western's service was followed by Bonanza Air Lines in the early 1950s also flying DC-3s.\n\nImperial County Airport covers an area of 370 acres (150 ha) at an elevation of 54 feet (16 m) \"below\" mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 14/32 is 5,308 by 100 feet (1,618 x 30 m) and 8/26 is 4,501 by 75 feet (1,372 x 23 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2011, the airport had 14,589 aircraft operations, an average of 39 per day: 71% general aviation, 10% scheduled commercial, 2% air taxi, and 17% military. At that time there were 47 aircraft based at this airport: 83% single-engine, 8.5% multi-engine, and 8.5% helicopter.\n\nThe following airline offers scheduled passenger service:\nSeaPort Airlines previously operated Cessna 208 Caravan single turboprop engine aircraft on all scheduled flights from the airport. On January 19, 2016, Seaport Airlines announced the cessation of all service within California, citing their inability to find pilots as the reason.\n\nWestern Airlines was serving Imperial County Airport during the late 1940s with Douglas DC-3 flights to Los Angeles via stops in San Diego and Long Beach, and was also flying nonstop to Yuma. Bonanza Air Lines, a \"local service\" air carrier as defined by the federal Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), began serving the airport during the early 1950s . According to its March 1, 1953 system timetable, Bonanza listed its flights to the airport as service to El Centro and was operating Douglas DC-3 prop aircraft with a daily westbound routing of Phoenix-Blythe-Yuma-El Centro-San Diego-Santa Ana-Los Angeles. Bonanza was also operating a daily eastbound DC-3 service at this time with routing of Los Angeles-Santa Ana-San Diego-El Centro-Yuma-Blythe-Phoenix-Prescott-Kingman-Las Vegas. By 1963, Bonanza had retired the DC-3 from its fleet and was operating all flights into the airport with new Fairchild F-27 turboprops. In 1964, the airline was operating nonstop F-27 propjet flights to Los Angeles and San Diego with one stop service to Phoenix via an intermediate stop in Yuma. In 1968, Bonanza merged with Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which continued to serve the airport with the F-27 with nonstops to San Diego and Santa Ana (now John Wayne Airport) as well as direct flights to Los Angeles, Phoenix and Tucson. In late 1970, Air West was serving the airport with Douglas DC-9-10 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners with four flights a day including two nonstops to Los Angeles (LAX) and two direct flights to Phoenix (PHX) via an intermediate stop in Yuma (YUM). At this same time, one of the DC-9 jet flights to LAX operated continuing, no change of plane service to Fresno, San Francisco, Portland, OR and Seattle via intermediate stops at other Air West destinations. Air West would then be renamed Hughes Airwest which in 1972 had ceased jet service into the airport but was still operating nonstop F-27 propjet flights to Los Angeles and Santa Ana with direct service to Phoenix via a stop in Yuma.\n\nBy 1980, Hughes Airwest had transitioned to an all-jet fleet and was no longer serving the airport. Following the cessation of service by Hughes Airwest, a number of commuter and regional airlines operated flights over the years including one air carrier, Imperial Airlines, that had its beginnings at the airport. The following is a list of airlines and aircraft that served Imperial County Airport (IPL) from 1979 through 1999 primarily to Los Angeles (LAX) and Phoenix (PHX) with Imperial Airlines and Air Bahia also flying nonstop to San Diego (SAN), and Scenic Airlines flying nonstop to both Las Vegas (LAS) and Long Beach (LGB) with this information being taken from the various editions of the Official Airline Guide (OAG) over the years:\n\n\nBy early 2007, only one airline was serving the airport: SkyWest operating as United Express flying Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops with nonstop service to LAX as part of a Los Angeles-El Centro/Imperial-Yuma route. SkyWest subsequently ceased all service to the airport.\n\n"}

He has outlined a plan for a balanced budget and attempted to cut middle class taxes by slashing in half the percentage of the state's grocery tax and increasing the Homestead Property Tax Credit, which can provide for the lowering of property taxes.\n\nBeebe has focused heavily on education reform. He has called for an additional $19 million per year to be spent on assisting special needs students and has designed a program that attempts to increase the quality of teachers within Arkansas by providing alternative pay and mentoring to motivate bright students to enter education or young teachers to work in struggling rural schools. Beebe has rejected calls to allow for Social Security private accounts to be established. He has also made plans to phase out the tax on utilities for manufacturers.\n\nHe outlined a 12-point plan to make health care more accessible and affordable. Some of his proposals include using federal tax credits to make private insurance cheaper, expanding Medicaid, increasing use of preventive care to stop health concerns before they grow worse, expanding school health clinics, and using home and community-based care as an alternative to nursing homes.\n\nIn January 2011, he said that he supported a tax increase for highway funding saying \"If they pass a tax increase for highways and it was reasonable, I'd sign it. I don't think it's going to happen.\"\n\nIn January 2012, he proposed a $163 million funding increase in a $4.7 billion state budget. He called for $117 million increase in the Human Services Department and a $56 million increase in public schools. He also called for an audit of the state's Forestry Commission's finances after a $4 million shortfall and a layoff of 36 workers.\n\nIn the 2012 midterm elections, Republicans gained control of both houses of the General Assembly for the first time since 1874 after making major gains two years earlier. This made Beebe the first Democratic Governor of Arkansas ever to face a Republican-controlled legislature. The GOP margin was 21 to 14 in the Senate, and 51 to 48 in the House (with one Green). In his 2013 State of the State address, Beebe made a comprehensive case for Medicaid expansion. In April 2013, Beebe signed into law Arkansas's \"private option\" to use federal Medicaid money to purchase private insurance for thousands of low-income residents. To become law, the proposal needed a two-thirds majority vote. The state's General Assembly, with Republicans in the majority, narrowly approved the three necessary bills to establish and finance the insurance program.\n\nBeebe did not see his approval rating slip below 70 percent at any point during his tenure, according to yearly polls from the University of Arkansas. According to the FiveThirtyEight Blog, \"[Beebe's] crossover appeal — and the recent history in Arkansas of producing a popular Democratic president — might suggest Mr. Beebe, who will be term-limited in 2014, would be among the more talked-about 2016 contenders.\"\n\nOn November 12, 2014, two months before the end of his term, Beebe said he intended to pardon his son for a 2003 felony drug possession conviction.\n\nIn March 2015, Beebe joined the Roberts Law Firm PA of Little Rock. In December 2015, he was named to the board of directors for Tyson Foods.\n\n\n"}

In his writing of some 19 books he focused on the creeks of the Thames Estuary and the English east coast. His books include \"The Magic of the Swatchways\", \"The First of the Tide\", \"Yachting on a Small Income\", and \"Sixty Years a Yacht Designer\". He was the editor of \"Yachting Monthly\", the British sailing magazine, from 1927 until 1967.\n\nMaurice's family had moved from South London to Ipswich in 1903 when his father became the East of England representative for a glove manufacturer\n. In London they had lived opposite a railway line and Maurice's early love was trains. His first job was with an estate agent but in his spare time he wrote articles about trains for the \"East Anglian Daily Times\" and it was train travel that soon led him to Ipswich docks where he discovered boating.\n\nHe started a small yacht brokerage and in the course of this work he learnt a lot about sailing and boat building. In 1925 he published a little book called \"Yachting on a Small Income\", which sold well on railway station platforms.\n\nHis father died suddenly leaving the family in considerable debt and the family home had to be sold. His mother Lena, and older brother Leslie, moved to the Midlands to stay with relatives. Maurice's brokerage business folded so he decided to try his luck selling yachting articles freelance in London. It was a struggle; his health was to never fully recover from this experience.\n\nGeorge Bittles, the publisher of \"Yachting Monthly\", had bought Griffiths' book at his local railway station and believed he would be the right person to edit a new magazine called \"Yacht Sales and Charters\", basically a yacht brokerage with its own magazine. Griffiths made such a success of this that other brokers threatened to stop advertising in \"Yachting Monthly\" if the new magazine continued. That magazine was stopped but Griffiths had proven himself and was given the position of Editor of \"Yachting Monthly\".\n\nIn 1927 he married Dulcie Kennard whom he had met while visiting the offices of yachting magazines, trying to sell his articles. She also wrote for the yachting press under the name Peter Gerard. They were divorced in 1934.\n\nAs a lieutenant-commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Griffiths was awarded the George Medal for \"gallantry and undaunted devotion to duty\" in recognition of his work trawling for mines in the North Sea as well as deactivating parachute mines dropped on the London Docks during the Blitz and also his command of a group of divers clearing mines from the Suez Canal. Later in the war he had responsibility for the design and fitting of the explosive charges that sank 77 condemned ships off the coast of Normandy, where they formed part of the Mulberry Harbour used during D-Day and after in 1944.\n\nHe met his second wife, Marjorie, known as \"Coppie\" from her maiden name of Copson in December 1944 while based with the RNVR at HMS Vernon. Coppie died about nine months before her husband and there were no children from either marriage.\n\nAfter the war he returned to \"Yachting Monthly\". The invention of marine plywood and fibreglass now enabled his boat designs to be mass-produced. The most successful were the Eventide 24, soon followed by the 26, and the Waterwitch 30. These, along with his other designs, proved to be good seaworthy craft but he was under no illusions about their aesthetic appeal, once saying: \"If you ever see a barrel or box with rudder and sails, it'll be one of my designs.\"\n\nA biography of Griffiths, \"The Magician of the Swatchways\" was written by Dick Durham and published in 1994.\n\n\n"}

In 2007, the school was named the No. 1 high school in Montgomery County by \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". The school was also ranked No. 8 in \"Philadelphia Magazine's\" 100 Best Public and Private Schools.\n\nThe high school is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and certified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The school has a 99%+ graduation rate, and more than 95% of graduates continue on to a two- or four-year college. Upper Dublin High School is represented at each service academy and almost all top universities.\n\nAfter months of deliberations, the school board decided to move forward and proposed to rebuild the high school. On March 20, 2007, the voters in Upper Dublin were presented with a referendum. They approved, despite the risk of a significant tax increase. Initial estimates of the new construction is $119 million. The construction was to occur in stages on the site of the current building and demolition of the oldest wing began in summer 2008. It was completed in the Summer of 2012, on time and within budget, and was formally opened with a ceremony in Fall 2012.\n\nThe Educational Support Team (EST) is a team of faculty members offering assistance to students who are having problems in school because of drug and alcohol use or because of depression or thoughts of suicide. The Team identifies, intervenes, and refers those students for help.\n\nStudents in the senior class are provided with the opportunity to investigate career opportunities in the final three weeks of the year. Students are required to have a community sponsor, a faculty sponsor, at least a \"C\" average in each course, meet attendance requirements, and have committee approval in order to participate in the Community Study Program.\n\nStudents at Upper Dublin High School have the option to attend the Eastern Center for Arts and Technology, which is accredited by the Middle State Association of Colleges and Schools.

The school has 14 male varsity sports and 13 female varsity sports recognized by PIAA. The school also has a cheerleading squad.\n\nUpper Dublin High School was the subject of controversy when in July 1996, then superintendent Dr. Clair Brown Jr. announced that Mark Twain's book, \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" would be removed from the school's required reading list. Brown removed the book as an administrative action, claiming that parents and students had protested the inclusion of the book in the curriculum because its frequent use of the word \"nigger\" made \"black children uncomfortable.\"\n\n"}

Gornick was previously the cinematographer of the first film, and the screenplay was written by Romero who was director of the original film. It was once again based upon stories by Stephen King, and features three more horror segments consisting of \"Old Chief Wooden Head\", \"The Raft\" and \"The Hitchhiker\".\n\nUnlike the first film, \"Creepshow 2\" only contains three stories instead of five. Originally, two additional stories, \"Pinfall\" and \"Cat from Hell\" were set to appear in the film, but were scrapped due to budgetary reasons; however, the latter has been filmed for \"\". The film was Dorothy Lamour's final film before her death in 1996.\n\nA delivery truck pulls up to a newsstand in a small town, Dexter, Maine where a young boy named Billy (named after and confused with the boy from \"Creepshow\") arrives eagerly waiting for it. The truck's back shutter opens to reveal a sinister figure who drops off a package onto the sidewalk — the latest issue of \"Creepshow\", much to Billy's delight. As the film momentarily turns into an animation, the package opens of its own accord, (revealing the cover of the comic is the same as the cover in the final scene of the previous film). As Billy begins to read, the delivery man reveals his true identity as the Creep.\n\nAn elderly couple named Ray and Martha Spruce (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) in a small, fictional, Arizonan town called Dead River, oversee a general goods store whose decor includes a cigar store Indian named \"Old Chief Wood'nhead\" (Dan Kamin) on the front porch, and are humbled to see their old, run-down town coming to a bitter end. The Spruces are visited by a Native American elder named Benjamin Whitemoon from a local tribe who gives them turquoise jewellery, which are his tribe's sacred treasures, as collateral for the debt the tribe has incurred.\n\nThe elder bids them and Old Chief Wood'nhead (who nods to him, briefly startling him) farewell and returns to his tribe. Later that night, the Spruces are subject to a vicious robbery led by Benjamin's estranged ne'er-do-well nephew, Sam (Holt McCallany) armed with a shotgun, and his two friends, Andy, and Fatstuff. After ransacking the store, Sam demands that Ray hand over the turquoise. The Spruces refuse and are fatally shot by Sam. Sam shoots out the windows and fires a round at Old Chief Wood'nhead, knocking over a can of red paint Ray had been using to touch up the war paint on Old Chief Wood'nhead. The three thugs drive away and begin preparations to run away to Hollywood, California, where the vain Sam expects to become a movie star, in part due to his long, dark hair. Old Chief Wood'nhead comes to life after they leave and uses the spilled paint to finish his warpaint and embarks on a vicious warpath to kill the thugs and avenge the murdered Spruces.\n\nAfter brutally killing Fatstuff and Andy, Old Chief Wood'nhead corners Sam in his home, with Sam being unable to fight back as the shells from his shotgun have no effect on his wooden assailant. Sam attempts to lock himself in his bathroom and escape through a window, but Old Chief Wood'nhead breaks through the wall, grabs Sam by his long hair, pulls him through the wall, and scalps him.\n\nWhen Benjamin Whitemoon wakes up in the morning, he finds the bag containing the turquoise jewelry by his side. He visits the Spruce's general store to find Old Chief Wood'nhead on his pedestal, holding his nephew's bloody scalp, a blood-stained knife, and fresh war paint adorning the chief's face. Now aware of what has happened to the Spruces and what Chief Wood'nhead has done to the killers, Benjamin wishes the old warrior a peaceful afterlife and drives away.\n\nAfter reading Old Chief Wood'nhead, Billy is seen at the town post office, receiving a package from when he sent a product ad from his copy of the \"Creepshow\" magazine. Incensed by the skeptical clerk's dismissal of paying $9.99 for a toy from the \"funny papers,\" Billy reveals that the package actually contains the bulb for a carnivorous Venus flytrap. The clerk doubts the actuality of the package and Billy sets off for home and the Creep presents another tale.\n\nFour college students, Deke, Laverne, Randy, and Rachel, go swimming in a desolate lake far from civilization. After they make their way to a wooden raft, they are terrorized by a floating black blob resembling an oil slick that grabs a hold of Rachel and consumes her.\n\nPanicked, Deke plans to swim to shore so he can bring back help. Before he can, the blob seeps through the raft's cracks and pulls Deke through the raft, killing him. Randy and Laverne evade the creature until it gives up trying to grab them from under the raft. Randy and Laverne are afraid to fall asleep in fear that the creature will attack.\n\nThey manage to sleep and Randy is the first to wake up, relieved to find that he and Laverne made it through the night. He begins sexually assaulting Laverne's sleeping body and fondling her breasts. She awakes screaming in agony as the creature is revealed to have seeped through the cracks and has covered the right half of her face, much to Randy's horror. As the oil-like blob pulls her off the raft and begins consuming her, Randy jumps off to swim to shore. He ultimately makes it, barely escaping the creature, and yells \"I beat you!\" However, the creature rears up from the water like a wave and engulfs Randy. It returns to the lake, leaving no evidence of the four students ever having visited the lake, other than their still-running car. Unknown to the students, there was a \"no swimming\" sign barely visible behind some thick vegetation.\n\nOn his way back home from the post office and reading The Raft, Billy is ambushed by a gang of neighborhood bullies, who taunt him. The gang's leader, Rhino, takes his package from him and smashes it. He then opens the package, finding the Venus Flytrap bulb, and drops it on the ground after Billy attempts to threaten him to give it back, crushing it with his foot. In retaliation, Billy kicks Rhino in the groin and flees, with Rhino and his gang in hot pursuit. The Creep then appears and presents another tale.\n\nAn adulterous Mainer businesswoman named Annie Lansing (Lois Chiles) gets up from bed after sleeping with a gigolo, realizing that she has to get home before her wealthy attorney husband to avoid suspicion. Annie hops into her car and heads for home several miles away. As she loses control at a slippery corner, she accidentally kills a Dover-bound hitchhiker (Tom Wright). Seeing that no one witnessed the incident, she takes off. Shortly after she leaves, the area of the incident is crowded with passersby, who report the hit-and-run to the police.\n\nMiles away from the scene, Annie thinks about what she has done and the consequences involved. She ultimately concludes that no one has anything on her and thinks that everything will be fine. Before she can continue, however, the hitchhiker she killed suddenly appears outside her window and utters \"Thanks for the ride, lady,\" a line he repeats throughout the story. Annie speeds off in terror, but everywhere she goes, the hitchhiker always reappears. She repeatedly runs him over, hurls him off the top of her car, slams his body into trees, etc. and he only gets more and more battered and bloody without dying. At one point, he pulls up his \"DOVER\" sign which reads \"You killed me\". Annie eventually loses control of her car and drives off the road, down a hill and into a tree, knocking herself out.\n\nAnnie awakens a while later, not seeing the hitchhiker anywhere and believes it to be a nightmare. She gets back on the road and drives home, succeeding in getting there before her husband. As she begins to step out of her car, the hitchhiker, gruesomely mangled from the trip, appears from under her car and attacks her. While Annie vainly attempts to fight him off, the garage door swings shut and the interior begins to fill with smoke. Later, Annie's husband - the same man who reported the hit and run - finally arrives home to find Annie in her car, dead from carbon monoxide poisoning caused from her still-running car, with the hitchhiker's bloodied \"DOVER\" sign around her neck.\n\nAs the Creep is about to drive away, he spots Billy still being chased by the bullies. Billy leads his pursuers into a vacant lot swarming with out-of-control plant growth. As he rides into what seems to be a dead end, the bullies move in to pummel him, only to learn that the bulb they smashed was not the first one Billy had ordered, as a quintet of Giant Flytraps emerge from the surrounding weeds and devour the thugs one by one. The spectacle is witnessed by the Creep, who cackles in glee as he drives off in his delivery truck to deliver the latest issue of \"Creepshow\" to another town. In a post-credits scene, the following text appears:\n\n\"Juvenile delinquency is the product of pent up frustrations, stored-up resentments and bottled-up fears. It is not the product of cartoons and captions. But the comics are a handy, obvious, uncomplicated scapegoat. If the adults who crusade against them would only get as steamed up over such basic causes of delinquency as parental ignorance, indifference, and cruelty, they might discover that comic books are no more a menace than Treasure Island or Jack the Giant Killer\".\nColliers magazine, 1949\n\nOriginally, the film was planned to have five stories much like the first film, two of these consisted of \"Pinfall\" and \"Cat from Hell\". These two segments, however, were cut from the film due to the film's budget. \"Cat from Hell\", which would later be used in \"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie\", focused on a wealthy old man hiring a hitman for $100,000 to kill a black cat, which was believed to killed three other people inside the residence he lives in and fears to be next. Unbeknownst to them, the cat soon exacts cosmic revenge on the two.\n\n\"Pinfall\", which was set to appear after \"Old Chief Wood'nhead\", told the story of two rivalry teams consisted of the Regi-Men and the Bad News Boors competing in a bowling alley owned by an aged millionaire; the owner is soon killed in a freak accident and the teams found out afterwards that he would award one of them $5 million for whoever got the highest score. Soon, things turn up for the worst of the Regi-Team when the Boors, after they were killed in a fiery car-crash purposely caused by the Regi-Team, return as burnt-up revenants and soon get their revenge on their killers. Unlike \"Cat from Hell\" which managed to be brought onto the screen through a different film, \"Pinfall\" was never shot and never appeared outside of the film's original script. However, in 2014, the segment was funded through Kickstarter by Dayle Teegarden and was successfully pledged by its backers with £1,231 put into the project against its £1,000 goal. The segment itself was also going to be put into the sequel for \"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie\", but this never came to fruition.\n\nDuring \"The Raft\" segment, actor Daniel Beer cited that he had almost died from hypothermia due to the water being very cold. While the crew wanted him to continue working with his role, the director Michael Gornick brought him to the hospital as he feared the actor would leave the set and never return if they get him to keep working during his cold condition. After a full recovery, he managed to finish the segment.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on May 1, 1987. On its opening weekend, it grossed $3,584,077 and has achieved $14,000,000 during its run in theaters.\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"has three suitably grisly ideas that are only glancingly developed. The episodes are marginally interesting, but each is a little too long. And each could be fully explained in a one-sentence synopsis.\" Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" panned the film as an \"omnibus snoozefest which is utterly lacking in chills or thrills,\" with all three stories \"so deficient in imagination and scare quotient they wouldn't pass as even satisfactory episodes on a tv show like 'Amazing Stories' or 'The Twilight Zone.'\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the film \"a cut-rate sequel from those two popular masters of horror, Stephen King and George Romero, that plays like leftovers. Fans of both deserve better.\" Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the film \"goes nowhere slowly. Part of the problem is that that King's short stories simply work better in print.\" Allmovie awarded 1.5 stars out of 5 in a retrospective review and stated: \"Despite its strengths -- a livelier pace, some creatively gory set pieces -- this is a much cheaper-looking effort than its predecessor, with the deft guidance of Romero conspicuously absent (long-time collaborator Michael Gornick took up the directorial reins); as a result, King's gross-out sensibilities don't come off as well.\"\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 32% approval rating with a 3.84/10 average rating based on 22 reviews as of November 2019.\n\nAfter its theatrical release, the film was released on VHS the same year by New World Home Video. While being released by Anchor Bay Entertainment on DVD, a special edition DVD of the film was released with the cover art being a homage to the \"Tales from the Crypt\" comic books from EC. In 2013, the film was released on Blu-ray by Image Entertainment on September 3, 2013. On December 13, 2016, Arrow Video released a special edition Blu-ray in the United States. The release contains many interviews with the cast and crew along with behind the scenes footage.\n\n\"Creepshow 3\" was released in 2006 via Taurus Entertainment who had purchased the naming rights. The film featured no involvement whatsoever from Stephen King or George Romero and was critically panned.\n\n"}

A quartet (from the UK) also performed at Disneyland Paris from the opening in 1992 until 1995 and were known as The Main Street Quartet.\n\nWhile the group usually performs as a quartet, they actually have up to twelve singers at each park, plus occasional substitutes. This allows them to have multiple quartets performing separately or to combine and form a larger ensemble. Membership has changed over the years as various singers have retired or died and new ones have been brought in to succeed them. Several of the Dapper Dans are members of the Barbershop Harmony Society.\n\nAt the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, the Dapper Dans perform 9 sets a day, 7 days a week. They can be found on the horse-drawn trolley in the morning, and all over Main Street USA during the afternoon, where visitors can be serenaded by the Dans while having their hair cut in a real, working barbershop. At 5pm, the Dans join the Main Street Philharmonic and the Magic Kingdom Security Color Guard for the Flag Retreat Ceremony.\n\nThe Dans at Disneyland can be seen on their Schwinn custom four-seater bicycle (commissioned by Walt Disney himself) and in various locations around Main Street. The Dans at Hong Kong Disneyland stroll up and down Main Street from Town Square.\n\nAnother unique part of Dapper Dans lore is the fact that they use Deagan Organ Chimes as part of the act. Each of the eight chimes has three octaves of a single note, comprising a C scale. The Organ Chimes were made by the J.C. Deagan Company in Chicago, Illinois, around 1901.\n\nThe Dapper Dans have seen many renowned members since their creation in 1959. Barbershop Harmony Society international gold medalists Roger Ross and Kevin Miles have sung with the Dapper Dans as well as four-time gold medalist, Tony DeRosa. Members of the Dapper Dans also include the Barbershop Harmony Society international collegiate quartet gold medalists, Aaron Stratton, Paul Hesson, Chad Bennett, film and TV actor-comedian Monty Jordan, Grammy Award winning Audio Engineer Tom Knox and Eric Monson. The original Hong Kong Disneyland Dapper Dans consisted of the Hong Kong a cappella group Metro Vocal Group.\n\n"}

In March 2013, the airport was the fourth-busiest single runway airport in the United States. In August 2017, the airport announced a new commercial airline Cal Jet, would start operating flights in September 2017.\n\nMost U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, but McClellan–Palomar Airport is CRQ to the FAA and CLD to the IATA. The ICAO identifier is KCRQ.\n\nThe airport is named for Gerald McClellan, an aviator and civic leader in San Diego's North County area.\n\nThe airport also was the basis of part of the name of the TV production company Lorimar Television.\n\nMcClellan–Palomar Airport covers and has one asphalt runway, 6/24, .

{"id": "2046034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046034", "title": "Parnelli Jones", "text": "Parnelli Jones\n\nRufus Parnell \"Parnelli\" Jones (born August 12, 1933) is an American former professional racing driver and racing team owner. He is notable for his accomplishments while competing in the Indianapolis 500 and the Baja 1000 desert race. In 1962, he became the first driver to qualify over 150 mph. He won the race in 1963, then famously broke down while leading the 1967 race with three laps to go in a turbine car. During his career as an owner, he won the Indy 500 in 1970–1971 with driver Al Unser, Sr.\n\nJones won races in many types of vehicles: sports cars, IndyCars, sprint cars, midget cars, off-road vehicles, and stock cars. He is also remembered for bringing the stock block engine to USAC Sprint car racing as one of the \"Chevy Twins\" with Jim Hurtubise. He is associated with the famous Boss 302 Mustang with his wins using the engine in the 1970s. Jones' son P. J. Jones was also a diverse driver, with IndyCar and NASCAR starts and a championship in IMSA prototype sports cars. His other son Page Jones was an up-and-coming driver before suffering career ending (and life-threatening) injuries in a sprint car at the 4-Crown Nationals, and has been in rehabilitation, working with his father-in-law. Following the death of 1960 Indianapolis 500 winner Jim Rathmann, Jones is now the oldest living \"500\" winner.\n\nBorn in Texarkana, Arkansas, Jones' family moved to Torrance, California, where he grew up (and lives in nearby Rolling Hills). He was nicknamed Parnelli by his boyhood friend Billy Calder, who hoped that the Jones family would not discover their son was racing cars as a 17-year-old minor. Jones participated in his first race in a Jalopy race at Carrell Speedway in Gardena, California. He developed his racing skills by racing in many different classes in the 1950s, including 15 stock car racing wins in the NASCAR Pacific Coast Late Model Series.\n\nHis first major championship was the Midwest region Sprint car title in 1960. The title caught the attention of promoter J. C. Agajanian, who became his sponsor. He began racing at Indianapolis in 1961.\n\nJones was named the 1961 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year, an honor that he shared with Bobby Marshman. Jones led early in the race and ran among the leaders until being hit in the face with a stone, bloodying his face, blurring his vision and slowing him to a 12th-place finish.\n\nIn 1962, he was the first driver to qualify over 150 mph at the Indianapolis 500, winning the pole position at a speed of . Jones dominated the first two-thirds of the race until a brake line failure slowed him, and he settled for a seventh-place finish.\nIn the 1963 Indianapolis 500, he started on the pole. This was the year the controversial Lotus-Ford rear-engined cars made their first appearance, and had ruffled the Indianapolis establishment. Before the race, the chief steward, Harlan Fengler, told the teams that he would black-flag any cars that leaked oil on the track, warning, \"\"Don't believe me, just try me.\"\"\n\nWith Scotsman Jim Clark in a Lotus-Ford closing on Jones in the waning laps, Jones' car developed a horizontal crack in the external oil reservoir. At that moment, driver Eddie Sachs crashed on the oil-slickened racing surface and brought out a yellow caution flag, slowing the field. Agajanian, Jones' car owner, argued with chief steward Harlan Fengler not to issue a black flag, insisting the oil level had dropped below the level of the crack, and that the leak had stopped. As Agajanian pleaded with Fengler, Lotus head man Colin Chapman rushed up to join the conversation and demanded that Fengler follow the rules about disqualifying cars with oil leaks. With the end of the race just minutes away, Fengler took no action, and Jones went on to win. The Lotus-Ford team, while unhappy with the obvious favoritism displayed by race officials toward Jones and Agajanian, also acknowledged Jones' clear superiority in the event. In addition, Ford officials recognized that a victory through disqualification of Clark's biggest competitor would not be well received by the public, so they declined to protest.\n\nAlso that year, legendary vehicle fabricator Bill Stroppe built a Mercury Marauder USAC Stock car for Jones. Jones won the 1963 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the car, and broke the stock car speed record.\n\nIn 1964, he won seven races (and tied for a win) on his way to the USAC Stock car crown. He won the Turkey Night Grand Prix midget car event. Mercury decided to pull out of stock car racing after the season.\n\nHe won five of the nine midget car events that he entered in 1966, including the Turkey Night Grand Prix. He finished fourteenth in the final points despite competing in only nine of 65 events.\nIn 1967, he drove in the Indianapolis 500 for owner Andy Granatelli in the revolutionary STP-Paxton Turbocar. Jones dominated the race but dropped out with three laps to go when a small, inexpensive transmission bearing broke. After 1968, turbine-powered cars were legislated out of competitiveness.\n\nAlso in 1967, as part of his stock car contract with the Lincoln-Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company, Jones drove a Mercury Cougar for Bud Moore in the second-year Trans Am series. In April, Jones dueled with teammate, friend and rival Dan Gurney in a brutal , 4-hour event at Green Valley, Texas in 113-degree heat, losing by inches to Gurney.\n\nStroppe suggested that Jones try his hand at off-road racing in front of a large crowd at a Christmas party in 1967. Jones at first said no, since he had enough of dirt. Stroppe suggested that maybe off-road racing was too hard for Jones, and the challenge started Jones' off-road career. Jones and Stroppe teamed up for the Star Dust 7/11 race across the Nevada desert in early 1968. Jones had never driven or pre-run the Ford Bronco. Jones hit a dry wash at full speed, which broke the wheels and blew out the front tires. Jones would later have a guest appearance in the original film \"Gone in 60 Seconds\" featuring him and his Bronco which was stolen in the plot. Jones had become hooked on off-road racing.\n\nIn 1968, Jones headed a super-roster of seven drivers signed by Andy Granatelli to drive STP Lotus 56 turbine cars in an unprecedented single-team assault on the Indianapolis 500. The deaths of Jim Clark and Mike Spence, plus a serious injury to Jackie Stewart, whittled the entry to four. Jones, testing his reworked 1967 car in practice, was dissatisfied with the car's performance compared to the newer \"wedge\"-shaped Lotus 56 turbines, and had concluded the car was unsafe. He stepped out of the car, which was subsequently assigned to Joe Leonard, who promptly wrecked the car in practice. Jones retired from driving IndyCars, but later admitted, \"If I hadn't already won Indy, they could never have kept me out of that car.\"\n\nJones entered the 1968 NORRA Mexican 1000 (now Baja 1000). Jones led until the marker. The Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame describes Jones' racing style: \"Jones and Stroppe had to find a way to keep their vehicles in one piece. During races Jones would push the vehicles at maximum speeds until they gave way, with Stroppe telling him at top volume the entire time to take it easier on the vehicle.\"\n\nJones had a special car fabricated that looked like a Bronco, but had racing parts that could withstand rigorous jarring that off-road vehicles endure. Jones named the vehicle \"Big Oly\" after his sponsor Olympia Beer. Jones used the vehicle to lead the Mexican 1000 from start to finish in a new record time of 14 hours and 59 minutes.\n\nJones had major wins in the 1973 season. He won his second Mexican 1000 in 16 hours and 42 minutes. He also won the 1973 Baja 500 and Mint 400 off-road events. Jones had a major accident at SCORE International's 1974 Baja 500, and stepped away from full-time off-road racing to become a race car owner.\n\nJones raced SCCA Trans Am sedans owned by Bud Moore: Mercury Cougar (1967) and Ford Mustang (1969—1971). Parnelli's dominance of the extremely competitive 1970 season brought Ford the manufacturer's championship.\n\nJones retired with six IndyCar wins and twelve pole positions, four wins in 34 NASCAR starts, including the 1967 Motor Trend 500 at Riverside, 25 midget car feature wins in occasional races between 1960 and 1967, and 25 career sprint car wins. His fifteen wins is eighth on the all-time in NASCAR Pacific Coast Late Model history.\n\nIn 1993, Jones took part in the Fast Masters. He advanced to the final championship round and placed 6th overall.\n\nJones started Vel’s Parnelli Jones Racing, which won the Indianapolis 500 again as an owner in 1970 and 1971 with driver Al Unser driving the Johnny Lightning special. The team also won the 1970, 1971, and 1972 USAC National Championships.\n\nJones owned the Parnelli Formula One race team from late 1974 to early 1976, although it achieved little success.\n\nJones returned to off-road racing as owner of Walker Evans' 1976 SCORE truck, and Evans won the championship. They teamed up for the 1977 CORE Class 2 championship.\n\nJones owned vehicles that took class wins at the Baja 500 and Baja 1000. His USAC Dirt Car won two championships and the Triple Crown three times.\n\nJones starred in the one-hour documentary \"Behind the Indianapolis 500 with Parnelli Jones\". Narrated by Bob Varsha, the film takes viewers behind the scenes of the Indianapolis 500, through the eyes and experiences of Parnelli Jones. In addition to Parnelli, Rick Mears, Mario Andretti, Bobby Unser, Al Unser, Jr., PJ Jones, Chip Ganassi, and others are interviewed throughout. The film was selected for the 2016 Sun Valley Film Festival, which Parnelli and Bob Varsha attended.\n\nJones is inducted in over 20 Halls of Fame including:\n\nJones owned and operated several successful businesses. He owned Parnelli Jones Inc., which operated 47 retail Parnelli Jones Tire Centers in four states. Parnelli Jones Enterprises was a chain of Firestone Racing Tires in 14 Western United States. Parnelli Jones Wholesale was a reseller which sold and distributed shock absorbers, passenger car tires, and other automotive products to retail tire dealers.\nIn addition, Parnelli Jones has several wheel manufacturers companies since the beginning of the 70s, z.b. Rebel Wheel co, US Mags and American Racing Equipment.\nSaleen, Incorporated, in Irvine, California, produced a limited edition (500 unit) 2007 Saleen S302 PJ commemorating Parnelli's 1970 SCCA Ford Mustang Boss 302 racer. This limited-production mustang comes with a stroked out version of the stock Mustang GT 281 c.i. engine. With the new displacement reaching 302 c.i. the new engine power rating is and 390 lb/ft of torque. Other special performance enhancements to this car include a special Watts-Link suspension unique to the 1970 Boss Mustang used by Parnelli Jones.\n\n"}

It has operations in about 50 countries and describes its mission as the development of \"engineered polymer solutions that seal, damp and protect critical applications in demanding environments\".\n\nThe company was founded in 1905 as \"Trelleborgs Gummifabriks AB\" (the Rubber Factory Corporation of Trelleborg) by Henry Dunker and Johan Kock, who were both already active in the rubber industry. Initially, the company had 150 employees and produced bicycle tires and rubber for industrial applications. During World War I, the Swedish Armed Forces placed substantial orders.\n\nBy the mid 1930s, the number of employees had reached 1,000. Beginning in the 1950s, the share of revenue from sales outside of Sweden increased; in 1950, it was 4%, and in 1970, it was 40%. In 1964, Trelleborgs Gummifabriks AB was floated at the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The current name was adopted in 1977. Between 1983 and 1991, the strategy was to act as a wide-ranging industrial conglomerate, with a particular focus on mining and metals. Later, the company's focus returned to rubber products. In 1999, the scope was further narrowed by specializing in industrial applications. In 2003, polymer-based precision seals were added to the product offerings. In 2009 the European Commission fined several marine hose producers, among them Trelleborg AB, \"...for participating in a cartel for marine hoses between 1986 and 2007 in violation of the ban on cartels and restrictive business practices in the EC Treaty (Article 81) and the EEA Agreement (Article 53).\" In mid 2012, Trelleborg and Freudenberg formed a 50/50 joint venture in antivibration solutions for light and heavy vehicles, TrelleborgVibracoustic.

{"id": "2046064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046064", "title": "Abraham Nemeth", "text": "Abraham Nemeth\n\nAbraham Nemeth (October 16, 1918 – October 2, 2013) was an American mathematician and inventor. He was Professor of Mathematics at the University of Detroit Mercy in Detroit, Michigan. Nemeth was blind, and was known for developing a system for blind people to read and write mathematics.\n\nNemeth was born in New York City on the Lower East Side of Manhattan into a large family of Hungarian Jewish immigrants who spoke Yiddish. He was blind from birth from a combination of macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nHe attended public schools at first but did most of his primary and secondary education at the Jewish Guild for the Blind school in Yonkers, New York. His undergraduate studies were at Brooklyn College where he studied psychology. He earned a Master of Arts degree in Psychology from Columbia University.\n\nNemeth studied mathematics and physics at Brooklyn College. He did not major in mathematics because his academic advisors discouraged him. However, tired of what he felt were unfulfilling jobs at agencies of the blind, and with the encouragement of his first wife Florence, he decided to continue his education in mathematics. He received a Ph.D. in mathematics from Wayne State University.\n\nNemeth taught part-time at various colleges in New York. Though his employers were sometimes reluctant to hire him knowing that he was blind, his reputation grew as it became apparent that he was a capable mathematician and teacher. Nemeth distinguished himself from many other blind people by being able to write visual print letters and mathematical symbols on paper and blackboards just like sighted people, a skill he learned as a child. Nemeth says that this skill allowed him to succeed in mathematics, during an era without much technology, when even Braille was difficult to use in mathematics. During the 1950s he moved to Detroit, Michigan to accept a position at the University of Detroit working with Keith Rosenberg. He remained there for 30 years, retiring in 1985. During the late 1960s he studied computer science and began the university's program in that subject.\n\nAs the coursework became more advanced, he found that he needed a braille code that would more effectively handle the kinds of math and science material he was tackling. Ultimately, he developed the Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation, which was published in 1952. The Nemeth Code has gone through 4 revisions since its initial development, and continues to be widely used today.\n\nNemeth is also responsible for the rules of MathSpeak, a system for orally communicating mathematical text. In the course of his studies, Nemeth found that he needed to make use of sighted readers to read otherwise inaccessible math texts and other materials. Likewise, he needed a method for dictating his math work and other materials for transcription into print. The conventions Nemeth developed for efficiently reading mathematical text out loud have evolved into MathSpeak.\n\nNemeth was instrumental in the development of Unified English Braille (UEB) from 1991 to at least 2001, though he eventually parted ways with others developing that code, and instead worked on a parallel effort called the Universal Braille System (sometimes abbreviated as NUBS with his name appended to the front). As of 2012, UEB was officially adopted by BANA as the standard for literary braille, but Nemeth Code was also fully retained as an optional official coding system. Work on NUBS may continue, or it might be merged into a future rules-update to the official Nemeth Code (the most recent official rules-update to Nemeth Code was in 2013).\n\nNemeth was still working on the Nemeth code when he died. Nemeth had been active in the Jewish community since childhood, and since his retirement from academic mathematics he had been transcribing Hebrew prayer books into Braille.\n\nNemeth was an active member of the National Federation of the Blind. He has written several short stories and made speeches for the NFB about his life as a blind mathematician. On February 11, 2006, Nemeth suffered a massive heart attack, but recovered and was well enough to attend the July 2006 NFB convention and accept the 2006 Louis Braille award which the organization gave him. On July 9, 2009, he was honored by the NFB as a co-recipient of the Dr. Jacob Bolotin award.\n\nNemeth's obituary was prematurely published twice in Jewish and blindness-related magazines, when workers at the magazines believed he had died when in fact his brother and wife had actually died.\n\nNemeth was a member of the United States Democratic Party but was appointed by a Republican governor of Michigan as chairman of the state commission for the blind, a position in which he served for two years, though he said that he did not like politics.\n\nHe was a proficient pianist who loved entertaining others, had an amazing memory for dates and information and enjoyed telling jokes and stories which he could match to almost any subject or occasion.\n\n"}

He is most famous for submitting the Dreyse needle gun in 1836 to the Prussian army, which was adopted for service in December 1840 as the \"Leichte Perscussions-Gewehr M 1841\" – a name deliberately chosen to mislead about the rifle's mechanism – later renamed Zündnadelgewehr M 1841 in 1855.\n\nDreyse was born in Sömmerda (then ruled by the Archbishopric of Mainz), the son of a locksmith. Dreyse worked from 1809 to 1814 in the Parisian gun factory of Jean-Samuel Pauly, a Swiss who designed several experimental breech-loading military rifles. After returning to Sömmerda in 1824, he founded a company to manufacture percussion caps. It was there that he designed the needle rifle.\n\nWhile the gun is thought of by some to be the first bolt-action rifle, in reality it bears little resemblance to modern bolt-action rifles, except for the bolt principle itself which was applied to close the breech. Ammunition for the Dreyse rifle was made up of paper cartridges holding the bullet into a sabot. The gun's needle penetrated the paper cartridge before igniting the black powder charge. The Dreyse's simple construction made it relatively easy to keep clean and in operation. For instance, worn needles could be quickly replaced without dismantling the bolt mechanism. The Dreyse rifle was a significant ordnance improvement for its time, since it permitted a much faster rate of fire than the muzzle-loading rifled muskets which were the standard of world's armies until the mid-1860s. It also enabled riflemen to reload without standing and exposing themselves to fire.\n\nThe Dreyse rifle was used by the Prussians during the Second Schleswig War, Austro-Prussian War, at the Battle of Königgrätz, and the Franco-Prussian War. By that time, the gun was fast becoming obsolete, and was outclassed by the French bolt-action \"Mle\" 1866 Chassepot rifle. Other bolt-action rifle designs had emerged in other countries. For example, in 1869 Switzerland adopted the bolt-action Vetterli rifle, which was a tube-magazine rimfire metallic cartridge repeater. The French transformed the 11mm Chassepot into a metallic-cartridge bolt-action rifle, the \"Mle\" 1874 Gras. Germany had also switched earlier to an 11mm metallic cartridge with the entirely new Mauser Model 1871 bolt-action rifle. Great Britain and the U.S. evolved from muzzle-loaders to metallic-cartridge breech-loaders, but with systems other than bolt action, during that same period.\n\nThere remains some ambiguity about the activities of von Dreyse after he created the needle-gun, as he seems to have dropped the \"Johann\" part of his name and was known as \"Nikolaus von Dreyse\".\n"}

Alexander McDougall built her as a prototype \"rectangular ship\" or \"sea-going canal boat,\" with a plain, low hull and a superstructure that could be removed to pass under canal bridges. She was acquired from her builder by the U.S. Shipping Board on 29 June 1918; transferred to the U.S. Navy the same day; and commissioned at New York 19 October 1918. She remained in custody of the 3d Naval District while preparing for sea. Lt. G. C. Daniels assumed command on 29 January 1919.\n\nAssigned to the 5th Naval District at Norfolk, \"Robert L. Barnes\" departed New York 12 March 1919 for Hampton Roads. Subsequently, she operated out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and New York until returning to Norfolk 18 April 1919. The ship remained inactive at Norfolk and was undergoing overhaul 4 September 1919 when she was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. She departed Norfolk 21 November for San Pedro, California, via the Panama Canal and San Diego, California After transporting diesel fuel to Pearl Harbor, the tanker departed Hawaii 8 April 1920 with fuel oil for Guam.\n\nArriving at Apra Harbor, on 27 April, \"Robert L.

In 2002, Peedi's Megahertz produced debut single, \"One for Peedi Crakk,\" charted in the R&B/hip-hop Top 40. He continued to make appearances on various Roc-a-Fella albums, including Jay-Z's and Freeway's Philadelphia Freeway. His guest appearances were usually standouts, and his mixtapes gave him a reputation among East Coast rap fans. Faced with increasing exposure, the Philly rapper decided to modify his rap name to Peedi Peedi.\n\nHowever, in 2005, two problems greatly affected Peedi's career. State Property dissolved, and Roc-a-Fella Records formally split into two. Jay-Z remaining at Def Jam with 50 percent, and Roc-a-Fella co-founder Dame Dash taking the other 50 percent to Universal Records under his Dame Dash Music Group. Peedi refused to side with Sigel and Dame Dash, and was briefly a free agent until Jay-Z, who soon became the president of Def Jam and maintained the Roc-a-Fella catalogue at the label, signed him. Peedi began working on a debut album, \"Prince of the Roc,\" but it was continuously delayed.\n\nIn 2006, Peedi was featured on \"Game Theory\", the first Def Jam release by fellow rap group The Roots, on its single \"Long Time\". Shortly afterwards, Roots drummer and leader ?uestlove offered Peedi a provisional spot with the group. Peedi stated he would welcome the chance to join The Roots. The one single for his shelved album, \"Take Me Home,\" was released in 2007. Peedi became at odds with the label over his album, and tensions developed between him and Jay-Z. Peedi decided to lash out against the executive/rapper in the press and leaked several Jay-Z diss tracks, before he was released from his contract in 2008.

The cabinet-level agency is responsible for maintaining the state's trunk highway system (including state highways, U.S. highways, and interstate highways), funding municipal airports and maintaining radio navigation aids, and other activities.\n\nThe agency's history can be traced to the state's Railroad and Warehouse Commission which emerged slowly from 1871 to 1905, and the State Highway Commission created in 1905. The Highway Commission was abolished in 1917 and replaced by a Department of Highways. The Minnesota Highway Department has been credited with numerous works listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. For air transport, the Minnesota Aeronautics Commission was created in 1933. Much of the railroad oversight was transferred to the Minnesota Department of Public Service in 1967. Two years later in 1969, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety was established and took over the Highway Patrol and Driver's License Bureau. MnDOT finally came into being in 1976 and took over the functions of the aeronautics and highway departments, plus transportation-related duties of the Minnesota State Planning Agency and Department of Public Service. \n\nMnDOT operates networks of ramp meters and traffic cameras in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in order to manage traffic flow. The department has also put up informational electronic signage along highways to provide alert messages. Message boards have been in Rochester, Duluth and the Twin Cities for some time. Part of the reason for the Rochester signs is occasional flooding of U.S. Highway 52. The department expanded use of the signs after Amber Alert legislation allocated funding for larger networks. In the Twin Cities, MnDOT began using them to display freeway travel times in 2003 or 2004 to help drivers plan alternate routes to avoid heavy traffic if necessary (although a generic message like \"buckle up for safety\" is sometimes encountered during special safety campaigns planned in conjuncture with the State Patrol and Department of Public Safety).\n\nTwin Cities Public Television (TPT) station KTCI channel 17 has been used for many years to display weather-related information that is funded by MnDOT. This service is continued on channel 2-4 following the digital transition. The department also had a long-standing partnership with KBEM-FM radio (88.5 FM) in Minneapolis to relay area traffic information, although that relationship is coming to an end. After public outcry, the term was extended, but it is unclear how long the two organizations will continue the relationship. MnDOT paid KBEM-FM US$400,000 per year to provide the information, about half of the station's annual budget. Video from traffic cameras is also shown on cable television systems in the metro area (at one time, this had also been shown on KVBM channel 45, today known as KSTC).\n\nMnDOT is led by the commissioner of transportation, who is appointed by the governor for a term coinciding with the governor’s. The commissioner may appear as a party on behalf of the public in any proceeding before any governmental agency regulating public services or rates relating to transportation. The commissioner also provides technical and financial assistance to the Metropolitan Council and regional development commissions in the regional transportation planning process.\n\nBelow is a list of Minnesota Highway Department (1917–1976) and Minnesota Department of Transportation (1976–present) commissioners:\n\n\n"}

The airport is eligible for the Essential Air Service program but has no scheduled air service and is not eligible to request funding for service until April 30, 2026.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration says this airport had 1,831 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2010, a decrease from 2,455 in 2009. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a \"general aviation\" airport (the \"commercial service\" category requires 2,500 enplanements per year).\n\nVisalia Municipal Airport was built in 1927 and purchased by the city in 1928.\n\nThe Works Progress Administration (WPA) began several projects at the Visalia Municipal Airport in 1936, and the WPA would continue to make improvements at the field.\n\nThe War Department assumed control of the airport in February 1942, just weeks after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, which led the United States to enter World War II. The airport was renamed the Visalia Army Air Field (Visalia AAF) and operations at the facility began almost immediately upon the United States Army Air Forces control of the airfield. Anti-submarine patrols were conducted from Visalia AAF by the 47th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) using Lockheed A-29 Hudson, and later B-25 Mitchell medium bombers.\n\nIn June 1942, the Visalia AAF was established as a sub-installations of the newly built Hammer Field in Fresno (along with Hayward AAF and Palmdale AAF). It shared Hammer Field's mission to train light, medium and heavy bomber squadrons. During that period Consolidated B-24 \"Liberator\", B-25s, Martin B-26 \"Marauder\" and the A-29s operated from Visalia AAF.\n\nIn January 1944, Army Air Forces headquarters ordered the entire Air University night fighter training program to California to be headquartered at Hammer Field. Under the supervision of the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) and the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group, night fighter crews were organized into Overseas Training Units and entered three phases of training. In all phases, Visalia AAF was used as a satellite training site. During this period, Douglas P-70 \"Nighthawk\" (heavy night fighter version of the A-20 \"Havoc\" light bomber) and Northrop P-61 \"Black Widow\" operated from Visalia AAF. It is known that the 425th Night Fighter Squadron was stationed at Visalia AAF for its entire training cycle from February until May 1944 when it was deployed to the European Theater at RAF Charmy Down, England as part of the Ninth Air Force.\n\nIn 1946 the War Assets Administration, acting on behalf of the War Department, terminated the leases with the City of Visalia and other parties with the remainder of the lands transferred to the City of Visalia in 1947.\n\nUnited Airlines flights began in 1946-47; their DC3/CV340/DC6/737s ended in 1979-80.\n\nAfter the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978, Visalia Municipal Airport became eligible for the Essential Air Service program. Since then (Air Midwest, Great Lakes Airlines, Scenic Airlines, SeaPort Airlines, SkyWest Airlines, Swift Aire Lines, and Wings West Airlines) served the airport, but none was successful.\n\nSeaPort Airlines was the most recent airline at Visalia. Starting February 9, 2015, SeaPort operated 12 nonstop round trips a week to Burbank Bob Hope Airport and 12 nonstop round trips a week to Sacramento International Airport. The airline suspended its service without notice on January 15, 2016.\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Visalia Transit began operating its new V-Line bus service connecting the Visalia Airport to Downtown Visalia, Downtown Fresno, California State University, Fresno and the Fresno Yosemite International Airport.\n\nAfter the abrupt cancellation of commercial air service, the US Department of Transportation received proposals from three other airlines to start service from Visalia using Essential Air Service (EAS) funding, but the community rejected the offers. The City stated in a letter that, \"Based on a thorough review of all proposals and consideration of industry trends and the recent history of declining air service performance in Visalia, it is the Council's belief that none of the carriers have a strong enough proposal to guarantee that Visalia would maintain eligibility in the EAS program.\"\n\nIn January 2017, the city asked to be enrolled in the Essential Air Service Community Flexibility Pilot Program which allows communities to receive a cash grant equal to two years worth of subsidy in exchange for forgoing their EAS funding for the next ten years. Visalia was the first community ever to enroll in the program established in 2003. In March 2017, Visalia received a grant worth $3,703,368 for the construction of two 10-unit tee hangars to serve small single-engine aircraft, and one corporate hangar to serve business jets and large aircraft. In exchange, the city will be ineligible to receive EAS subsidy funding for service until April 30, 2026.\n\nVisalia Municipal Airport covers 821 acres (332 ha) at an elevation of 295 feet (90 m). It has one asphalt runway, 12/30, 6,559 by 150 feet (1,999 x 46 m), and one helipad 45 by 45 feet (14 x 14 m).\n\nIn the year ending April 28, 2011 the airport had 63,900 aircraft operations, average 175 per day: 92% general aviation, 4% airline, 4% air taxi, and <1% military. 134 aircraft were then based at this airport: 78% single-engine, 18% multi-engine, 4% jet, and 1% glider.\n\n\n"}

A keystone head at the apex of the central span symbolises the River Liffey, corresponding to the heads on the Custom House (also designed by James Gandon) which personify the other great rivers of Ireland.\nSince 1860, (following similar work on \"Essex Bridge\" – now Grattan Bridge), to improve the streetscape and relieve traffic congestion on the bridge, it was intended to widen Carlisle Bridge to bring it to the same width as 70 metres (230 ft) wide Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street) which formed the north side carriageway connection to the Bridge. Between 1877 and 1880 the bridge was reconstructed and widened. As can be seen on orthophotography it spans now 45 m of the Liffey and is about 50 m wide. \n\nWhen the bridge was reopened c.1882 it was renamed for Daniel O'Connell when the statue in his honour was unveiled.\n\nIn recent years, the lamps that graced the central island have been restored to their five lantern glory. In 2004, a pair of pranksters installed a plaque on the bridge dedicated to Father Pat Noise, which remained unnoticed until May 2006, and was still there as of April 2019.\n\nThe bridge is the setting of Liam O'Flaherty's short story, \"The Sniper\", and is also referenced in several other works, including James Joyce's novel, \"Ulysses\".\n\nArthur Fields, locally known as \"The Man on The Bridge\", took more than 182,000 photographs of pedestrians on the bridge from the 1930s to the 1980s.\n"}

In 1963 it also added the business computer divisions of Ferranti. It exported computers to many countries around the world and went on to become part of International Computers Limited (ICL).\n\nThe ICT 1101 was known as the EMIDEC 1100 computer before the acquisition of the EMI Computing Services Division who designed and produced it.\n\nThe ICT 1201 computer used thermionic valve technology and its main memory was drum storage. Input was from 80-column punched cards and output was to 80-column cards and a printer. Before the merger, under BTM, this had been known as the HEC4 (Hollerith Electronic Computer, fourth version).\n\nThe drum memory held 1K of 40-bit words. The computer was programmed using binary machine code instructions. When programming the 1201, the machine code instructions were not sequential but were spaced to allow for the drum's rotation. This ensured the next instruction was passing under the drum's read heads just as the current instruction had been executed.\n\nThe ICT 1301, and its smaller cousin the ICT 1300, used germanium transistors and core memory. Backing store was magnetic drum, and optionally one-inch-, half-inch- or quarter-inch-wide magnetic tape. Input was from 80-column punched cards and optionally 160-column punched cards and punched paper tape. Output was to 80-column punched cards, printer and optionally to punched paper tape. The first customer delivery was in 1962, a 1301 sold to the University of London. One of their main attractions was that they performed British currency calculations (pounds, shillings and pence) in hardware. They also had the advantage of programmers not having to learn binary or octal arithmetic as the instruction set was pure decimal and the arithmetic unit had no binary mode, only decimal or pounds, shillings and pence. Its clock ran at 1 MHz. The London University machine still exists (January 2006) and is being reinstated to working condition by a group of enthusiasts.\n\nThe ICT 1302, used similar technology to the 1300/1301 but was a multiprogramming system capable of running three programs in addition to the Executive. It also used the 'Standard Interface' for the connection of peripherals allowing much more flexibility in peripheral configuration. The 'Standard Interface' was originally prototyped on the 1301 and went on to be used on the 1900 series.\n\nThe ICT 1400 was a first generation computer using thermionic valves, but was overtaken by transistor technology in 1959 and no sales were made.\n\nThe ICT 1500 series was a design bought in from the RCA Corporation, who called it the RCA 301. RCA also sold the design to Siemens in Germany and Compagnie des Machines Bull in France who called it the Gamma 30. It used a six-bit byte and had core stores of 10,000, 20,000 or 40,000 bytes.\n\nThe ICT 1900 series was devised after the acquisition of Ferranti's assets which brought in the new Ferranti-Packard 6000 machine from Ferranti's Canadian subsidiary, which was considerably more advanced than the existing 130x line. It was decided to adapt this machine to use the 'Standard Interface', and it was put on the market as the ICT 1904, the first in a range of upward-compatible computer systems.\n\nIn 1968 ICT merged with English Electric Computers, itself formed from the prior mergers of English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM) and Elliott Automation. The resulting company became International Computers Limited (ICL). At the time of the merger English Electric Computers was in the process of making a line of large IBM System/360-compatible mainframes based on the RCA Spectra 70, which was sold as the ICL System-4. Both 1900 and System-4 were eventually replaced by the ICL 2900 Series which was introduced in 1974.\n\n"}

Produced and co-written by Italian musician Giorgio Moroder and released in the US in early 1980 as a single, \"Call Me\" was No. 1 for six consecutive weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, where it became the band's biggest single and second No. 1. It also hit No. 1 in the UK and Canada, where it became their fourth and second chart-topper, respectively. In the year-end chart of 1980, it was \"Billboard\"s No. 1 single and \"RPM\" magazine's No. 3 in Canada.\n\n\"Call Me\" was the main theme song of the 1980 film \"American Gigolo\". It is played in the key of D minor. Italian disco producer Giorgio Moroder originally asked Stevie Nicks from Fleetwood Mac to help compose and perform a song for the soundtrack, but she declined as a recently signed contract with Modern Records prevented her from working with Moroder. It was at this time that Moroder turned to Debbie Harry and Blondie. Moroder presented Harry with a rough instrumental track called \"Man Machine\". Harry was asked to write the lyrics and melody, a process that Harry states took a mere few hours. The lyrics were written from the perspective of the main character in the film, a male prostitute. Harry said the lyrics were inspired by her visual impressions from watching the film and that \"When I was writing it, I pictured the opening scene, driving on the coast of California.\" The completed song was then recorded by the band, with Moroder producing. The bridge of the original English-language version also includes Harry singing \"Call me, my darling\" in Italian (\"Amore, chiamami\") (\"Love, call me\") and in French (\"Appelle-moi, mon chéri\") (\"Call me, my darling\"). \n\nIn the US, the song was released by three record companies: the longest version (at 8:06) on the soundtrack album by Polydor, the 7\" and 12\" on Blondie's label Chrysalis, and a Spanish-language 12\" version, with lyrics by Buddy and Mary McCluskey, on the disco label Salsoul Records. The Spanish version, titled \"Llámame\", was meant for release in Mexico and some South American countries. This version was also released in the US and the UK and had its CD debut on Chrysalis/EMI's rarities compilation \"Blonde and Beyond\" (1993). In 1988, a remixed version by Ben Liebrand taken from the Blondie remix album \"Once More into the Bleach\" was issued as a single in the UK. In 2001, the \"original long version\" appeared as a bonus track on the \"Autoamerican\" album re-issue.\n\nHarry recorded an abbreviated version of the song that was backed by the Muppet Band for her guest appearance on \"The Muppet Show\" in August 1980. It was first broadcast in January 1981.\n\nThe single was released in the United States in February 1980. It peaked at No. 1 and remained there for six consecutive weeks until it was knocked off by Lipps, Inc.'s worldwide smash hit \"Funkytown\" and was certified Gold (for one million copies sold) by the RIAA. It also spent four weeks at No. 2 on the US dance chart. The single was also No. 1 on \"Billboard\" magazine's 1980 year-end chart. The song lists at No. 57 on \"Billboard's All Time Top 100\". It was released in the UK two months later, where it became Blondie's fourth UK No. 1 single in little over a year. The song was also played on a British Telecom advert in the 1980s. 25 years after its original release, \"Call Me\" was ranked at No. 283 on the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1981, the \"Village Voice\" ranked \"Call Me\" as the third-best song of the year 1980 on its annual year-end critics' poll, Pazz & Jop.\n\nIn 1981, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, as well as for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song.\n\nThere were two videos made:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of two airports in Redding, along with Benton Airpark. In addition to general aviation, the airport has scheduled passenger flights to and from Los Angeles and San Francisco on United Express.\n\nThe City wanted a new Airport and put in for a Works Progress Administration project that was called the Stillwater Airfield. Before Stillwater Airfield was built in 1942, the site was acquired by the United States Army Corps of Engineers for the United States Army Air Forces and built the Redding Army Airfield. Initially Redding AAF was a sub-base for Chico AAF and garrisoned by the 433d Army Air Force Base Unit. It was under IV Fighter Command at Hamiltion AAF.\n\nThe mission of Redding Army Air Field was advanced flight training of new airmen prior to their deployment overseas into the combat zones of the Pacific, China, Mediterranean or European Theaters. The USAAF 399th Fighter Squadron, 369th Fighter Group operated P-39 Airacobras from the airfield for that mission.\n\nOn 1 November 1944 control of Redding AAF was transferred from the Fourth Air Force to the Sacramento Area Command of the Army Air Forces’ Air Technical Service Command headquartered at McClellan Field near Sacramento. The host unit was redesignated as the 4191st Army Air Force Base Unit. The mission was changed from training air crews to that of a refueling and maintenance facility for transient aircraft. Redding AAF was sporadically used by the Army Air Forces’ Air Transport Command as a refueling and service stop.\n\nOn 19 December 1945 the military declared Redding AAF excess and on 18 November 1946 it was turned over to the city for a civil airfield. Final transfer was in 1949, ending military ownership.\n\nThe City of Redding continues to operate the airport and has started a major commercial development.\n\nHughes Airwest (formerly Air West) flew Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle. Frontier Boeing 737-200s flew to Denver via Sacramento. United Airlines flew 737s nonstop and direct to San Francisco for several years starting in 1983. Pacific Express BAC One-Elevens flew nonstop to San Francisco and on to Los Angeles and also to Portland. In addition, American Eagle turboprops operating for American Airlines flew nonstop to San Jose, San Francisco, Eureka/Arcata, and Klamath Falls until late 1993.\n\nOn July 17, 2008 President George W. Bush and staff landed at Redding in Air Force One to allow the president to see the damage done by wildfires.\n\nRedding Municipal Airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 16/34, 7,003 x 150 ft (2,135 x 46 m) and 12/30, 5,067 x 150 ft (1,544 x 46 m).\n\nIn 12 months through April 2012 the airport had 104,674 aircraft operations, average 287 per day: 46% local general aviation, 17% transient general aviation, 36% air taxi, <1% scheduled commercial and <1% military. 222 aircraft are based at this airport: 175 single-engine, 27 multi-engine, 15 helicopter and 5 jet.\n\nThe City of Redding's remodel and expansion of the Terminal Building is complete, as of November 11, 2014, when the Grand Opening took place. The project cost approximately $9.8 million with the majority of funds coming from the FAA Airport Improvement Program. The Terminal Building was expanded from 20,000 sq. ft. to approximately 30,000 sq. ft. The secure passenger holding area increased its holding capacity from 70 passengers to over 200 passengers. The holding area now has restrooms; a convenience for passengers who previously had to leave the sterile area if they wished to visit the restroom. This project was constructed by the general contractor, Danco Builders Northwest, out of Arcata, CA.\n\nThe airport is southeast of Redding along Airport Road at Knighton Road. Interstate 5 can be reached to the west via Knighton Road, and California State Route 44 can be reached to the north via Airport Road. Both long-term and short-term parking are available, as well as car rental and taxi services.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their entrances were surrounded by plastered aprons which guided rainwater into them during the rainy seasons. Most of these archaeological features likely functioned as cisterns for potable water.\n\nChultunob' were typically constructed in locations where naturally occurring \"cenotes\" were absent (such as the Puuc hills, which sit hundreds of feet above the Yucatán Peninsula aquifer). While many were constructed to collect water, not all may have served that purpose. Some chultuns may have been used for storage of perishable comestibles or for the fermentation of alcoholic beverages. Experimental research conducted in the 1960s by Mayanist Dennis E. Puleston demonstrated that chultuns around Tikal were particularly effective for long-term storage of ramon nuts (Brosimum alicastrum).\n\nAfter a chultun ended its usefulness, many were used for discarding refuse or for human burials. This makes chultunob' an excellent source of information on both the life and death of ancient settlements of the Prehispanic Maya.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2046149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046149", "title": "Ganelon", "text": "Ganelon\n\nIn the Matter of France, Ganelon (, ) is the knight who betrayed Charlemagne's army to the Saracens, leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. His name is said to derive from the Italian word \"inganno\", meaning fraud or deception. He is based upon the historical Wenilo, the archbishop of Sens who betrayed King Charles the Bald in 858.\n\nGanelon's most famous appearance is in \"The Song of Roland\", where he is represented as a well-respected Frankish baron; Roland's own stepfather and Charlemagne's brother-in-law. According to this Old French chanson de geste Ganelon was married to Charlemagne's sister and had a son with her. Ganelon resents his stepson's boastfulness, great popularity among the Franks and success on the battlefield. When Roland nominates him for a dangerous mission as messenger to the Saracens, Ganelon is deeply offended and vows vengeance.\n\nThis revenge takes the form of treachery, as Ganelon plots the ambush at Roncesvals with Blancandrin. At the end, justice is served when Ganelon's comrade Pinabel is defeated in a trial by combat, showing that Ganelon is a traitor in the eyes of God. Ganelon is torn limb from limb by four fiery horses.\n\nIn Canto XXXII of the Book of Inferno in Dante's \"The Divine Comedy\", Ganelon (\"Ganellone\") has been banished to Cocytus in the depths of hell as punishment for his betrayal to his own country in the second round of the ninth circle called Antenora.\n\nGanelon (; commonly: \"Gano di Pontieri\", i.e. \"Ganelon of Ponthieu\" or \"Gano di Maganza\", i.e. \"Ganelon of Mainz\".) also appears in Italian Renaissance epic poem romances dealing with Charlemagne, Roland (Italian: \"Orlando\") and Renaud de Montauban (Italian: \"Renaldo\" or \"Rinaldo\"), such as Matteo Maria Boiardo's \"Orlando Innamorato\" and Luigi Pulci's \"Morgante\". The treachery and dishonesty of the House of Maganza became proverbial in Italy, as for example in this inscription of 1472 on the wall of a castle in Canzo: \"Non te fidare de femina nesuna / che sono tute dela caxa de Maganza\" (Don't trust any woman, / for they're all from House of Mainz).\n\nIn \"Don Quixote\", Cervantes wrote, \"To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon, he [Don Quixote] would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.\"\n\nHe is also mentioned in Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", both in \"The Shipman's Tale\", where his gruesome fate is a byeword (193-94: \"... God take on me vengeance/ as foul as evere hadde Genylon of France\") and in \"The Nun's Priest's Tale\" (225: \"O false assassin, lurking in thy den! O new Iscariot, new Ganelon!\").\n\nFollowing is an account of Ganelon's crucial role in Charlemagne's willful ignorance, which brings about the death of Duke Benes of Aygremount, derived from the prose version chanson de geste and prose romance \"Les Quatre Fils Aymon\" (also known as \"Renaud de Montauban\") and translated to English by William Caxton as \"The Right Pleasant and Goodly Historie of the Foure Sonnes of Aymon\".\n\n\"Now, a little before the feast of St. John the Baptist, King Charlemagne held a great court in Paris, and Duke Benes did not forget to go there as he had promised. And so he departed from Aygremount with two hundred knights and took his way to Paris to serve the king, as he would have him do.\n\n\"Now, the King being in Paris, his nephew the Earl Ganelon, Foulkes of Moryllon, Hardres, and Berenger, came to him and told him that Duke Benes was coming to serve him with two hundred knights, and Ganelon said: \"Sire, how may you love or be well served by him who so cruelly has slain your son, our cousin? If it were your pleasure, we should well avenge you of him, for truly, we would slay him.\"\n\n\"\"Ganelon,\" said the king, \"that would be treason, for we have given him our truce. But do as you will, so that the blame turn not upon me; and keep you well. For in certain the Duke of Aygremount is very powerful and of great kindred; and well might you find yourself with much to do, if you carry out your intent.\"\n\n\"\"Sire,\" said Ganelon, \"care nothing for that. There is no man in all the world rich enough to undertake anything against me or my lineage. And Sire, tomorrow early we shall depart with 4,000 fighting men; and you may be sure we shall deliver the world of him.\"\n\n\"\"Certainly,\" said the king, \"that would be treason.\"\n\n\"\"Care nothing for that,\" said Ganelon, \"for he slew well your son Lohier by treason, and he was my kinsman; and therefore I will be avenged if I may.\"\n\n\"\"Now do as you will,\" said the king, \"understanding always that I am not consenting thereto.\"\n\n\"When morning came, Ganelon and his knights departed early from Paris, and with them full 4000 fighting men. And they rode without tarrying until they came to the Valley of Soissons; and there they encountered Duke Benes with his followers.\n\n\"When Duke Benes saw them coming he said to his men, \"Lords, I see that yonder are some people of the king's coming from the court.\"\n\n\"\"It is of no importance,\" said one of his knights.\n\n\"\"I know not what it may be,\" said the Duke, \"for King Charlemagne is well able to think to avenge himself. And also he has with him a lineage of people who are deadly and cruel; that would be Ganelon, Foulkes of Moryllon, and certain others of his court. And in truth, last night I dreamed that a griffin came out of the heavens and pierced my shield and armor, so that his claws struck into my liver and my spleen. And all my men were in great torment and eaten by boars and lions, so that none escaped but one alone. And also, it seemed to me that out of my mouth issued a white dove.\"\n\n\"Then one of his knights said that all was well, and he should not dismay himself because of the dream. \"I know not what God shall send me,\" said the Duke, \"but my heart dreads me for this dream.\"\n\n\"Then Duke Benes commanded that every man should arm himself. And his knights answered that they would glady do so, and all sought their arms and equipment. And now you shall hear of the hard hewing and of a thing heavy to recount: the great slaughter that was made of the good Duke Benes of Aygremount, by the traitor Ganelon.\"\n\nThe text is online at:\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/rightplesauntno4400caxtuoft\n"}

Sneva (born June 1, 1948) is a retired American race car driver, the winner of the Indianapolis 500 in 1983. He primarily raced in Indy cars, and was named to the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2005.\n\nA former math teacher from Spokane, Washington, Sneva's win at Indianapolis followed several runner-up finishes and notable crashes. Nicknamed \"The Gas Man,\" he was an outstanding qualifier, winning the pole position three times (1977, 1978, 1984). He was also the fastest qualifier on a fourth occasion in 1981, but because of qualifying rules did not start the race from the pole position.\n\nSneva won two consecutive USAC National Championships for Indy cars in 1977 and 1978.\n\nBorn in Spokane, Sneva played football and basketball at Lewis and Clark High School and a year of college basketball at Eastern Washington State College in nearby Cheney. After graduation from Eastern, he worked as a math teacher before racing full-time. Sneva was the eldest of five brothers, all racers; the next oldest was Jerry, who also competed at Indy.\n\nAt Indianapolis in 1977, Sneva drove his famed Norton Spirit McLaren M24/Cosworth racer for car owner Roger Penske, and became the first driver to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 at a speed at or more. His one-lap track record on May 14 was .\n\nSneva won 2 races in 1977 and became the first driver in Team Penske history to win a championship. In 1978, Sneva did not win a race but with 5 second place finishes and 16 top fives, Sneva still won the championship. Despite this, Sneva was released by Penske after the 1978 season.\n\nIn 1984, Sneva became the first to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 over in his Texaco Star March 84C/Cosworth driving for the new Mayer Motor Racing team. His one and four lap track records on May 12 were and .\n\nSneva's career at the Indianapolis 500 was known for fast qualifying, second-place finishes, near misses and several crashes. Three times (1977, 1978, 1980) Sneva ended up the bridesmaid by finishing second. Finally, Sneva broke through in dramatic fashion in 1983 after a thrilling late race duel with Penske driver Al Unser, Sr. and the lapped car of Unser's rookie son, Al Jr. It was Sneva's 1983 win in his Texaco Star March 83C/Cosworth for Bignotti-Cotter Racing that led to his nickname of \"The Gas Man.\" That win was also famous for it being the last of George Bignotti's record seven Indianapolis 500 wins as a chief mechanic. For Sneva, the victory was sweet revenge, as he had been fired by Roger Penske in 1978 despite having won back-to-back USAC championships.\n\nSneva's second-place finish in 1980 is notable as it is one of only two occasions of such a finish by a driver starting last. It is also one of only three times the driver who started last (33rd) led laps during the race, a record matched by Alex Tagliani in 2016 and James Davison in 2017. Several other times Sneva was in contention for the win, but did not make it to the end of the race. In 1981, Sneva charged hard from his 20th starting position to lead early in the race, but his untested Blue Poly March 81-C/Cosworth was fragile and his clutch failed early on.\n\nOne year later, Sneva was in a duel with eventual winner Gordon Johncock and eventual runner-up Rick Mears when his engine in his Texaco Star March 82-C/Cosworth began losing power and eventually failed near the end of the race. In 1983, Sneva captured his first Indianapolis 500 win, engaging in a duel with Al Unser and his son in the final 20 laps. Al Unser Jr. was widely criticized after the race for trying to mess Sneva up to help his dad win, as well as having passed several cars under caution, and jumping the final restart, for which he received a two-lap penalty.\n\nAs defending champion in 1984, Sneva dueled with Mears only 32 laps from the finish, but his CV joint failed, enabling Mears to win. The 1985 race was a testament to Sneva's ability as he drove an ill-handling Skoal Bandit Eagle/Cosworth to second place before exiting in a crash with the lapped car of Rich Vogler. It was this series of near misses combined with second-place finishes and hard-charging qualifying and racing style that made Sneva a fan favorite at Indianapolis.\n\nHe suffered one of the most famous crashes at Indianapolis during the 1975 race, his second. After touching wheels with Eldon Rasmussen, 26-year-old Sneva flipped up into the catch fence and tore his car in half, but suffered mostly minor burns on 15% of his body in the fiery crash. He walked to the ambulance but was placed in the intensive care unit at Methodist Hospital, mainly for lung issues due to the fire retardant. Describing the crash years later Sneva quipped, \"In a situation like that it's important to talk to yourself: 'Faint, you coward, faint!'\"\n\nIn 1986, he was warming up his car during the pace lap, but lost control and crashed before the race started. In 1987, Sneva crashed three cars, two in practice, and one during the race. He crashed during the Indianapolis 500 in 1975, 1979, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1992, a record for crashes during the race.\n\nAfter Sneva's Indy victory in 1983, he never finished the race again. He dropped out of the race in 1984-1990, failed to qualify in 1991, and dropped out of the 1992 race as well. Some observers have attributed his decline in success to the switch to radial tires (the series transitioned to radials over a period from 1985–1987). His driving style was more apropos to bias ply tires.\n\nSneva showed his versatility by competing in eight NASCAR Winston Cup Series events in his career, spanning from 1977 to 1987. He earned one top-ten, a 7th in the 1983 Daytona 500.\n\nSneva's final start was the 1992 Indy 500. He arrived at Indy without a ride for 1993, and was unsuccessful in landing a car for the race. He retired with 13 career Indy car wins and 14 pole positions.\n\nAfter Sneva retired from driving, he was a color commentator for ABC television network's \"Wide World of Sports\" program and called several Indy 500s. He is also heavily involved in the golf course business where he resides in Paradise Valley, Arizona.\n\nSneva's father, Edsol (\"Ed\") was a local racer in the Spokane region.\n\nSneva is the oldest of five brothers and one sister: Jerry, Jan, Blaine, Ed (\"Babe\") and Robin. He said the brothers were always racing something growing up. Babe (1951–1976) succumbed to severe head injuries more than eighteen months after a race crash in \n\nSneva was an ace in mathematics, and graduated from Eastern Washington State College in nearby Cheney with an education degree. He became a math teacher in a school district outside of Spokane city limits, and drove the school bus.\n\nHe was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2005.\n\n"}

Her mother was Roberta Wolcott Hubbard Bell (1859–1885). Her maternal grandfather Gardiner Hubbard was the first president of Bell Telephone Company. When her mother died in childbirth in 1885, her father married her mother's sister, Grace Hubbard.\n\nThe family lived at their Twin Oaks (Washington, D.C.) estate in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington DC. Newspaper reports indicate that Grace could be classified a prankster: as a youth, she and her friends stole a trolley car for a joy ride through the streets of Washington and, on another occasion, she blocked traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue by joining hands with friends and roller-skating down the avenue.\n\nShe married U.S. Army Major Granville \"Rolly\" Fortescue (1875–1952), one of the sons of Robert Barnwell Roosevelt. Her husband was first cousin of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The marriage was not as financially successful as she would have wished. She was the mother of three daughters: Marion Fortescue, who married Daulton Gillespie Viskniskki in 1934, Thalia Fortescue Massie (1911–1963), and Kenyon Fortescue Reynolds (1914–1990), better known as actress Helene Whitney.\n\nOutwardly, the Fortescues appeared to be wealthy country gentry. In reality, financial affairs became a primary concern for them after Granville's final retirement from the army. With the exception of a short stint as a fiction editor for \"Liberty\" magazine in 1930, he did not have steady employment, preferring to wait for the fortune his wife would inherit at the death of her parents.\n\nIn 1932, Grace Fortescue was charged with murder and convicted by a jury of manslaughter for the death of Joseph Kahahawai, one of the defendants in the alleged rape of her daughter Thalia in Hawaii in 1931. Also charged and convicted with Fortescue were two sailors, Edward J. Lord and Deacon Jones, and Fortescue's son-in-law, Thomas Massie, who participated in the abduction and murder of Kahahawai.\n\nAttorney Clarence Darrow defended Fortescue, Jones, Massie, and Lord. He subsequently obtained a commutation of their sentence (ten years' imprisonment for manslaughter) to a one-hour confinement in the executive chambers of Territorial Governor Lawrence M. Judd.\n\nIn 1966, while being interviewed by author Peter Van Slingerland, Albert O. Jones admitted that he was the one who shot Joseph Kahahawai.\n\n\n"}

Comdr. Preston Herndon, USNRF, in command.\n\nSteaming from Mobile 10 January 1922, \"Laramie\" reached Norfolk 13 January and decommissioned 19 June. She recommissioned in ordinary 26 June 1940 at Philadelphia, Comdr. James J. Hughes in command. She arrived Brooklyn Navy Yard 28 June for alterations; recommissioned in full 6 December; returned to Philadelphia 15 December; and arrived Norfolk 17 January 1941 for duty with the Atlantic Fleet.\n\nBetween 18 January and 5 June \"Laramie\" made six runs to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to transport fuel oil to Norfolk and Bermuda. She sailed from Norfolk to Bahia Bay, Brazil, via Guantanamo Bay 24 June to 21 July; operated along the Brazilian coast until 13 August; then returned to Norfolk 1 September for overhaul. Departing 11 October, she carried fuel oil via Boston and St. John's, Newfoundland, to Narsarsuaq, Greenland, site of a United States air base known as Bluie West One, where she arrived 25 October.\n\nWhen the United States entered the war against the Axis powers, \"Laramie\" was operating along the southwestern coast of Greenland carrying oil and gasoline. She steamed from Narsarsuaq to Norfolk via Sydney, Nova Scotia, 11 to 23 December; and, after completing two fueling runs to Baton Rouge, she cleared Casco Bay, Maine, 8 March 1942 with a cargo of gasoline and oil for Army bases in Greenland. Throughout the remainder of 1942 and during 1943 she plied the stormy North Atlantic, transporting liquid and dry cargo to Greenland from Boston; New York; Sydney, Nova Scotia; and NS Argentia and St. John's, Newfoundland.\nLoaded with 361,000 gallons of aviation gasoline, 55,000 barrels of oil, and with general cargo, including depth charges. \"Laramie\" departed Sydney for Greenland 26 August 1942 as part of convoy SG-6. On the evening of the 27th she was torpedoed while steaming in convoy at the eastern end of Belle Isle Strait during a part of the Battle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Hit on the port side forward by a torpedo fired by U-165 commanded by Eberhard Hoffman, she immediately listed to port and went down by the bow some 37 feet. The blast demolished the forward crew's quarters, killing four men; opened a hole 41 feet long and 34 feet high, causing extensive flooding forward; and ruptured the port gasoline tank, spraying the ship with volatile liquid and explosive fumes.\n\nDespite flooding and imminent danger of explosion, the captain, Comdr. P. M. Moncy, took immediate and effective action to save \"Laramie\". Although gasoline ran ankle-deep over the forward gun platforms, no fires broke out, and a steam-smothering system protected unruptured holds. Prompt pumping of liquid cargo corrected the list and reduced the forward draft.\n\nEscorted by U.S. Coast Guard cutter \"Mohawk\", \"Laramie\" returned to Sydney 30 August before steaming to Boston 2 to 5 September for damage repairs. Commander Moncy later received the Navy Cross for directing the saving of \"Laramie\" under extremely hazardous conditions.\n\nAfter a run to Aruba, Netherlands West Indies, from 21 February to 2 March 1944 for a cargo of gasoline, \"Laramie\" resumed voyages to Greenland out of Boston 25 March.

Thomson liked the 26-year-old's work and in late 1834 offered him a job as chief engineer for $1,000 a year to help with construction of the new Georgia Railroad.\n\nPeters paid $100 for a rough paddlewheeler trip into camp near Charleston, South Carolina, in the brutally cold February 1835. He worked on the state railroad for the eight years it took to complete it from Augusta, to the new town of Marthasville, Georgia. During this period, he developed what became a lifelong friendship with Lemuel Grant; they both bought land in the new town.\n\nWhen the railroad was completed, Peters was hired as superintendent. In that position he heard many complaints about the name Marthasville, which people thought took too long to write in log books, freight records, etc. He traded letters with Thomson on the subject and, when the latter suggested Atlanta, Peters began printing up thousands of circulars to distribute from Augusta to Tennessee advertising the new name. It was officially changed in December 1845.\n\nPeters founded the first Atlanta steam factory, a flour mill at the Georgia RR between Butler and Calhoun streets (the location of today's Sloppy Floyd office building). Lacking a water power source, the mill had to be powered by wood. Peters purchased , the land lots 80 and 47, for $2,000 to serve as a lumber lot for pine wood. This area later developed as Midtown, between North Avenue and 8th Street. Later development of this land in the city proved to be the key to Peters' future wealth.\n\nAlways interested in transportation, Peters had operated a stage coach line between Atlanta and Montgomery, Alabama. After completion of the Atlanta & West Point Railroad, he moved the northern end to West Point, Georgia, and extended it to Montgomery.\n\nAlso an avid livestock breeder and horticulturist, in 1854 he established a nursery in Atlanta.\n\nIn early 1861, he sold the steam engine from his mill for $12,000 to be used in the Confederate Powderworks at Augusta. He was the civilian transportation agent for all Atlanta railroads, which were critical to supplying the Confederacy. He contracted with the blockade running Crenshaw Company, supplying cotton by rail in exchange for foodstuffs. During the American Civil War, Peters remained in Atlanta until a few days before the invasion of Union General Sherman's army.\n\nBy the time of the Battle of Atlanta, he and his family had moved to Augusta, where they stayed until April 1865. After Sherman left Georgia in December 1864, Peters hired James R. Crew to repair the of destroyed Atlanta and West Point Rail Road; Lemuel Grant worked to repair the nearly of wrecked Georgia Railroad. By April, the war was over, and rail service was restored to Atlanta.\n\nIn 1871 Peters built Atlanta's first street railway, Atlanta Street Railway Company, with the real estate developer George Adair.\n\nAfter the Kimball House was destroyed by fire, Peters helped lead the efforts to have that center of Atlanta life rebuilt. He invited Hanniball Kimball back to town to help raise money.\n\nWith new migrants flocking to the boomtown of Atlanta, Peters began to subdivide his north Atlanta land, first by laying out roads: north/south streets were named by trees (myrtle, juniper, apple, etc.) to match the naming of Peachtree Street. He threw in Penn to harken back to his Pennsylvania roots. The east/west streets were numbered, starting with 3rd Street (since North Avenue and Ponce de León were long-since named) and ending with the northernmost extent of his property, 8th Street.\n\nHe built his final home on the highest part of his land: the block bounded by Peachtree, 4th, Cypress and 5th streets. In 1884 Peters sold surrounding West Peachtree to Kimball for $1,000 an acre to create Peters Park, a development that eventually failed for lack of sales. In 1887 he sold of his remaining holdings to the state for $10,000 and donated another four acres to help found the Georgia School of Technology.\n\nIn 1848, Peters built a home in Atlanta and was married to Mary Jane Thompson, the daughter of the early settler and doctor, Joseph Thompson, and his wife. Together, Richard and Mary Jane had several children together, including: Richard, Edward, Ralph, Nellie, who all became prominent.\n\nPeters died on February 6, 1889 and was buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta.\n\nHe left a million-dollar estate. Of his two sons, Edward stayed on the estate and built Ivy Hall, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Ralph moved to New York, where he became president of the Long Island Rail Road.\n"}

The plant faced considerable public opposition after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. There were large protests and two dozen local groups opposed the plant.\n\nIn 1983, Suffolk County determined that the county could not be safely evacuated in the event of a serious nuclear accident at the plant. Governor Mario Cuomo ordered state officials not to approve any LILCO-sponsored evacuation plan—effectively preventing the plant from operating at full capacity. The plant was completed in 1984 and in 1985 LILCO received federal permission for low-power (5 percent power) tests.\n\nBy 1989, it became apparent that not enough local communities would sign on to the evacuation plan for the plant ever to be able to open. On May 19, 1989, LILCO agreed not to operate the plant in a deal with the state under which most of the $6 billion cost of the unused plant was passed on to Long Island residents. In 1992, the Long Island Power Authority bought the plant from LILCO. The plant was fully decommissioned in 1994.\n\nLong Island Lighting Company (LILCO) President John J. Tuohy announced plans for the plant on April 13, 1965 during a stockholder's meeting. The plant was to be the first commercial nuclear power plant on Long Island and initially had little formal opposition, as Brookhaven already had multiple research nuclear reactors at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, about south of Shoreham.\n\nLILCO purchased a site in an area which was sparsely populated at the time. They announced the plant would produce 540 megawatts, cost between $65 and $75 million and would be online in 1973. At the time, demand for electricity was increasing more than 10 percent per year on Long Island and the Atomic Energy Commission was strongly pushing all power companies to use nuclear power.\n\nIn 1968, LILCO increased the size of the plant from 540 to 820 megawatts and announced plans to build two more reactors in Jamesport. Those reactors never got beyond the drawing board stage but this helped delay and increase the costs of the plant.\n\nIn 1969, LILCO announced plans for a reactor at Lloyd Harbor in Huntington – closer to Manhattan in a more densely populated area. Following resident opposition, the proposal was dropped in 1970, setting the stage for opposition to any nuclear power plant on Long Island.\n\nThe plant was to be situated near the path of airplanes landing at MacArthur Airport and the New Haven Airport. It was also to be built in an area that the U.S. Air Force had designated as \"high hazard\" due to its proximity to the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Calverton, where Grumman military fighter planes were tested, which was five miles (8 km) from the Shoreham site. The Lloyd Harbor Study Group were concerned that a plane could crash into the plant, though studies suggest that an airliner impacting a containment structure would not destroy the structure or even cause sufficient damage to permit the escape of radioactive materials from the reactor core.\n\nThe plant was built between 1973 and 1984, completed with a General Electric type 5 boiling water reactor using Mark II containment. Its location on Long Island Sound – near the mouth of the small stream that forms the border between Brookhaven and Riverhead towns – was largely rural at the time (although within 60 miles of Manhattan). Cost overruns caused its estimated final cost to approach $2 billion by the late 1970s, due to low worker productivity and design changes ordered by the NRC.\n\nThe Sierra Club, the Audubon Society and environmentalist Barry Commoner opposed the issuance of a construction permit for the Shoreham plant. The plant drew considerable opposition after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, resulting in delays and cost increases before New York Governor Mario Cuomo ordered purchasing and decommissioning of the plant. The state would ultimately take over LILCO also.\n\nThe first small anti-Shoreham demonstration took place in June 1976. On June 3, 1979, following the Three Mile Island accident, 15,000 protesters gathered in the largest demonstration in Long Island history. 600 were arrested as they scaled the plant's fences.\n\nLILCO's problems were compounded by NRC rules in the wake of Three Mile Island, requiring that operators of nuclear plants work out evacuation plans in cooperation with state and local governments. This prompted local politicians to join the growing opposition to the plant. Since any land evacuation off the island would involve traveling at least back through New York City to reach its bridges, local officials feared that the island could not be safely evacuated.\n\nNora Bredes, executive director of the Shoreham Opponents Coalition, was a primary organizer of the grass-roots campaign against Shoreham during the 1980s. She lobbied officials, organized advertising campaigns, wrote pamphlets, and planned rallies. Ms. Bredes drew together more than two dozen local opposition groups which included the Lloyd Harbor Study Group, the Farm Bureau, The Long Island Safe Energy Coalition and its newsletter Chain Reaction, Safe'n Sound with its \"Sound Times\" newspaper, and the S.H.A.D. Alliance (modeled on New Hampshire's Clamshell Alliance). According to a Newsday poll, in 1981, 43 percent of Long Islanders opposed the plant; by 1986, that number had risen to 74 percent.\n\nOn February 17, 1983, the Suffolk County Legislature voted 15-1 in favor of a resolution stating that the county could not be safely evacuated in the event of an accident at Shoreham. The newly elected governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, then ordered state officials not to approve any LILCO-sponsored evacuation plan.\n\nThe plant was completed in 1984. In 1985 LILCO received federal permission for low-power 5 percent tests. Confidence in LILCO declined in 1985 when it took nearly two weeks to restore power to all of the island following Hurricane Gloria.\n\nBetween 1985 and 1989, as local communities continued to refuse to sign the necessary evacuation plan, LILCO proposed asking the U.S. Congress to approve a law for the evacuation — a move which went nowhere.\n\nOn February 28, 1989, Cuomo and LILCO announced a plan to decommission the plant, which involved the state taking over the plant and then attaching a 3 percent surcharge to Long Island electric bills for 30 years to pay off the $6 billion price tag. On May 19, 1989, LILCO agreed not to operate the plant in a deal with the state under which most of the $6 billion cost of the unused plant was passed along to Long Island residents. The Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), headed by Richard Kessel, was created in 1986 specifically to buy the plant from LILCO. In 1992, LIPA bought Shoreham from LILCO for the nominal sum of one dollar and closed it, making Shoreham the first commercial nuclear power plant in the US to be dismantled. The plant was fully decommissioned in 1994.\n\nIt cost $186 million to decommission the reactor, with the radioactive materials license ending in May 1995. The low-pressure turbine rotors are currently in use at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station. LILCO paid Philadelphia Electric Company $50 million to take its fuel to the Limerick Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nIn August 2002 a 100 MW Gas Turbine Power Plant was commissioned on the Shoreham site utilizing the existing switchgear that was in place for the decommissioned nuclear facility. This facility utilizes two 42 MW GE LM6000PC Jet Engine Generators equipped with Sprint injection (can increase capacity to 50 MW each) and Spray Mist Evaporative Cooling (SMEC).\n\nThe electric transmission infrastructure has remained, connecting it to the Long Island electric grid. In 2002 the Cross Sound Cable, a submarine power cable capable of transmitting 330 MW, was laid from the Shoreham plant across Long Island Sound to New Haven, Connecticut. During the Northeast Blackout of 2003 the cable was used to ease the effects of the blackout on Long Island. After extended negotiations with Connecticut the cable was put into permanent use.\n\nIn 2004, the Long Island Power Authority erected two 100-foot, 50 kW wind turbines at the Shoreham Energy Center site, as part of a renewable-energy program. At a ceremony, chairman Kessel stated, \"We stand in the shadow of a modern-day Stonehenge, a multibillion-dollar monument to a failed energy policy, to formally commission the operation of a renewable energy technology that will harness the power of the wind for the benefit of Long Island's environment.\" The turbines generate 200 MW⋅h per year, or 1/35,000th of the energy the nuclear plant would have produced.\n\nHad the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station gone into operation as planned, it would have prevented the emission of an estimated three million tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to journalist Gwyneth Cravens.\n\nA scene from the 2012 movie \"The Dictator\" is filmed inside the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plants Nuclear Control Room.\n\n"}

The main character is Shido, a vampire who protects humans from other supernatural creatures. A private investigator by day and a demon hunter by night, Shido solves murder cases caused by monsters called nightbreeds.\n\n is a 16-color PC eroge released in 1993. Nightwalker is an adventure game, focused mostly on character interaction and problem solving. While the main characters of this game have the same names and similar appearances to their anime equivalents, their personalities are generally more easy-going and their backgrounds are less tragic (they all have living relatives). In comparison to the anime, the game is fairly lighthearted, with Shidō and Guni providing comic relief.\n\nIn 2001 the developer Arieroof remade this game for Windows 2000 under the title \"Nightwalker\". This version uses the same source drawings as the original game, except with 256-color displays, and plays similarly. The characters are recolored, and match the anime more closely. (Shidō's hair is purple, Guni's body is green. Inexplicably, Yayoi's hair is bubblegum pink.)\n\nOne oddity of the series is that the character designs for the first four episodes are different from the main character designs used for the rest of the series and both the opening and ending. This is due to the fact that these episodes were intended to be presented as an OAV, with the remaining episodes added after the fact to make up the entire series.\n\nIn the world of \"Nightwalker\", attacks by the , minor demons that possess humans and feed on their souls, are relatively common. As a group, nightbreeds (often referred to by the abbreviation 'breed') are usually self-serving and of low intelligence, and they drive a human host to commit crimes. Because these breed-inspired crimes are often difficult to identify, a special agency known as the N.O.S. has been organized to investigate and solve breed-related cases.\n\nShido, the main character of the series, is a vampire who decided to defend humans against his demonic brethren as atonement for the sins he committed early in his vampiric life. He knows little of his life prior to becoming a vampire, and even his name is a pseudonym he took when he arrived in Japan. Upon settling down in Japan, Shido established a one-man (plus one-secretary) private investigator office, which he uses as a means to hunt breeds while keeping his true nature secret. Shido even keeps his identity secret from Riho, a teenage girl he decided to employ as a secretary after her parents were killed in a breed attack.\n\nAll is not business as usual at Shido's office, however, as Shido is soon forced to reveal to Riho that he is the same sort of creature that killed her parents. Furthermore, Shido's powerful and obsessive sire, Cain, has plans in motion to reclaim Shido, as well as to initiate the 'Golden Dawn', a secret with far-reaching implications for all creatures of the night.\n\nThe main character, Tatsuhiko Shido is a private detective. He is also a vampire with the ability to manipulate his own blood to form weapons. It is also implied that he has the ability to create illusions. Shido has an outwardly mercurial personality, but beneath that, he is very serious and dedicated so much so that he is likely to blame himself when something goes wrong. He is often employed by Yayoi Matsunaga. He is a quarter-vampire (one of his grandfathers was a full-blood vampire, and the rest of his family line is of Japanese descent), Shidō has inherited guardianship of the passage between the mortal world and the demon world, but otherwise he lives as a human. His 'day job' is private investigator, and he works closely with the Kanagawa police. Through this connection, he learns that a girl he was unable to save from nightbreeds was a student at St. Michael Girls Academy, and goes to the school to investigate. He is quite pleased about this because he is something of a pervert, and takes plenty of time out to ogle the teenage girls.\nAn agent with the N.O.S. anti-nightbreed crime unit. Yayoi pays Shido with her blood in exchange for his expertise in investigating nightbreeds, and their relationship goes beyond being strictly professional. In the game, Yayoi comes from a police family, and her father, the chief of the Yokohama police, worked closely with Shidō's vampiric relatives. As much as Yayoi resents it, she seems to be destined for the same role. She and Shidō dated prior to the game, but the relationship fell apart. Now they spend most of their time together bickering, and Shidō loves to tease her. Yet, there's still a bit of a spark between them.\nA high-school aged girl whose family was murdered by nightbreeds. Riho idolizes Shido and works as his secretary, but is initially unaware of that he is a vampire. She learns Shido's secret while attempting to help him with an investigation, but decides to continue working for him despite this. In both the PC Game and anime series, she is a student at St. Michael Academy, she shared a dorm room with Miyako, a girl who as murdered by nightbreeds. Normally cheerful and energetic, Riho is shocked and depressed by her friend's murder. When Shidō comes to her for help, she vows to avenge her friend's death and helps Shidō unravel the conspiracy based out of the school. Shidō drinks Riho's blood in the finalé of the game, and she becomes a vampire. Originally, Night Walker was planned to have Rihoko Ayukawa, a character from a previous TomBoy game called \"Bishōjo Audition\", in the role of heroine; as the project evolved, Rihoko became Riho. Because of the death of her parents, she lives by herself in an apartment complex.\nA small, fairy-like creature. Guni's relationship with Shido is like that of a familiar spirit, but she only assists him if she feels like it.

{"id": "2046197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046197", "title": "Lord Oliphant", "text": "Lord Oliphant\n\nLord Oliphant was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created at least twice and possibly four times. The first creation is dormant and the others are all extinct. The third and fourth creations have not been defined in law.\n\nThe title was certainly established by 1455 for Laurence Oliphant, 1st or 4th Lord Oliphant, but this creation became dormant on the death of the fifth (or eighth) lord in 1631. It was created again that same year for Patrick Oliphant (second creation), but this second creation became extinct in 1748 on the death of the tenth lord (or, fifth of second creation).\n\nThe earliest mention of Lord Oliphant is around the Tournai marble tombstone of Sir William Olifard's effigy in Aberdalgie Church, which itself has been dated to circa 1365 and reads: \"Hic jacet Dominus Willielmus de Olyphant, Dominus de Aberdalgy, qui obiis Quinto Die Mensis Februarir, millesimo tricentesimo vigesimo nono, Orate\" which translates as \"Here lies Lord William Olyphant, Lord of Aberdalgy, who died 5th February 1329.\" The date of 1365 is significant for raising this monument as it is the year after William's son Walter married the King's sister and so within \"living memory.\" There is no evidence to date of the creation of these two lordships and, Lord of Aberdalgy could be argued to denote a barony and not a lordship except that, they and the title Lord Dupplin were deemed in court in 1633 as having been resigned to the Crown by the 5th or 8th Lord Oliphant and thus were all three accepted as lordships by the Crown.(Duries’ Decisions, p. 685.)\n\nThe first documented evidence of Lord Oliphant is in the Great Seal of Scotland (\"Registrum Magni Sigilli Regum Scotorum\") where John Oliphant is cited as brother germain to Lord Oliphant, on 2 February 1394-5. Thereafter, the monks of Pluscarden record that in 1408, two brothers of Lord Oliphant, William and Arthur, had assisted in the murder of Sir Patrick Graham, Earl of Strathearn. Despite being second cousins of the King, these two brothers were drawn, beheaded and hanged. Walter Bower, who continued John of Fordun's chronicles is also cited to have made reference to the same incident circa 1408.\n\nThe first Lord Oliphant and his brothers John, Arthur and William were nephews of King David II of Scotland and first cousins of King Robert II of Scotland, as evidenced by their mother being described in numerous charters issued by King David II of Scotland as \"beloved sister.\"\nBy 1398 only five Lordships are thought to have been created in Scotland but between 1429 and 1500 at least forty six Lordships are known to have been created and that of Laurence, Lord Oliphant reappears then. The interim lack of any mention of a Lord Oliphant can be explained by Laurence’s father having died young in a feud between the Ogilvies and the Lindsays at Arbroath in 1445 and Laurence's grandfather William, although retoured heir to his father in 1417, spending some twenty years, being most of his adult life, imprisoned in England in the Tower of London from 1424, where he either died or did so within a year of his release., which precluded either from having the opportunity to have acted politically and be known as Lord Oliphant.\n\nThe Great Seal of Scotland is regularly cited as evidence in court cases and so seals the case that these Oliphant first cousins of the Royal Family had been made Lords at this early date.\n\nSir Lawrence (sic) Oliphant was acknowledged as a Lord of Parliament under King James the Third and the first mention of him as Lord Oliphant was in July 1455, a month after he reached his majority, indicating that he had become eligible to inherit it then, rather than that it had been created instanto. Sir Laurence sat in Parliament as a Lord of Parliament on 14 October 1467. The Dignity continued in regular succession to Laurence the fifth (or eighth) Lord Oliphant, who succeeded his grandfather, Laurence the fourth (or seventh) Lord, in 1593, his father, the Master of Oliphant, having perished at sea in 1584.\n\nThe principle of law, that a Peerage of Scotland of unknown origin shall be presumed to be limited to the heirs male of the body of the Grantee, had not been established by a decision or otherwise in the seventeenth Century; and Clan Oliphant Laurence Oliphant, 5th Lord Oliphant, having no son but having a daughter Anne who became the wife of Sir James I Douglas of Mordington, by a Procuratory of Resignation resigned his Peerage in favour of Patrick Oliphant his next heir male, desiring to ensure the continuance of his Dignity in the male line of his family. However, his intended destination was not processed as would have been usual by the King and no regrant followed upon it. Lord Oliphant died before the year 1631.\n\nThere having been no regrant, his daughter claimed the Peerage of Oliphant as his heir at law. The Court of Session exercised jurisdiction on claims to Peerages before the Union, and Lady Douglas’s case came before that Court on 11 July 1633, when her claim was opposed by Patrick Oliphant. The Lords of Session found that as her father and his predecessors had held and enjoyed the Dignity, such enjoyment and use, there being no Writ to show an entail, were sufficient to transmit the Lordship title to the heirs female; but that the Procuratory of Resignation, although the King had not conferred the Honour in conformity with it, had denuded Lord Oliphant of the Peerage and had barred all claims to it. (Duries’ Decisions, p. 685.)\n\nThis was to cherry-pick the form of descent and Lord Mansfield, in the Cassillis case in 1762, and or the Sutherland case in 1771, declared the decision of the Court of Session contrary to law and justice, (Mr. Maidment’s Report of the Cassillis case, p. 51, and of the Sutherland case, p. 9,) and it has been disregarded in all the cases which have come before the House of Lords in which similar questions were raised. See below for \"Notes on dignities in the peerage of Scotland which are dormant or which have been forfeited\" for a review of this anachronism. The reason for the anomaly was probably political, in that Sir James Douglas (the first Lord Mordington) was brother of the powerful Earl of Angus.\n\nThe King, according to the statement of Sir John Dalrymple of Stair, subsequently one of the Lords of Session, acted upon the views expressed by the Court of Session, and determined that the heir male should hold the Peerage of Oliphant. (Dalrymple’s Collections, p. 396.)\n\nThus, in 1641 the King created for Sir James Douglas, the husband of Anne, the daughter and heir of Laurence Lord Oliphant, a new title of Lord Mordington (on 10 March 1640 King Charles 1 referred to the Oliphant honours as \"the designation of Oliphant, Aberdalgie and Dupplin\".) and, granted him the precedency due to the former Lords Oliphant. It appears from the records of Parliament that Lord Mordington sat above the Lord Oliphant. This created the title of Lord Oliphant anew and in a manner not followed at any point since in Scottish Law.\n\nIt is certain that the heir male did become Lord Oliphant (second creation) because, on 19 October 1669, Lord Rosse protested that the calling of the Lords Elphinstone, Oliphant, Lovat and Borthwick before him should not prejudice him in his right to precedency before them, and on 12 June 1672, Lord Oliphant was present in Parliament as a Lord of Parliament, and sat in the precedency of the former Lords Oliphant. Patrick Oliphant of Newtyle, (afterwards Lord Oliphant,) the heir male, was the son of John Oliphant of Newtyle, the second son of Laurence the seventh Lord Oliphant. The male issue of Patrick Lord Oliphant failed in the person of Francis the fifth (second creation) Lord Oliphant, who died without issue in 1748.\n\nThe title of Lord Oliphant was, after the death of Francis, assumed by William Oliphant of Langton, descended from Peter Oliphant, the third son of Laurence the fourth Lord Oliphant. William voted as Lord Oliphant at the election of a Representative Peer without protest on 15 March 1750. However, the second creation was \"heirs male of the body\" of Patrick Oliphant of Newtyle and that title had become extinct on the death of the 5th Lord (second creation.) Therefore, in peerage law, this title of Lord Oliphant was a new and third creation. William died without issue in 1751, making that third creation extinct.\n\nLaurence Oliphant of Gask, descended from William Oliphant of Newton, the younger son of the second Lord Oliphant, appears to have been the next heir male after William and it is stated that William acknowledged him as his rightful successor, but having taken the part of Prince Charles Edward in the insurrection of 1745 he did not assume the title. On 14 July 1760 he was created Lord Oliphant in the Jacobite peerage. His male heir, or in default of male issue from him, the nearest heir male of his ancestor William, the founder of the Gask branch of the family, would be entitled to the Dignity (first/second creation) and failing issue from William, the male representative descending from George the younger brother of William, if any, would be the next heir to the Oliphant Peerage.\n\nHowever, the title of Lord Oliphant was next claimed and used without challenge by David Olyphant, 6th of Bachilton in 1757 until his death in London in 1770. Again, if he took up his seat in the House of Lords, in peerage law this constituted a new and fourth creation of the peerage. David Olyphant was not now thought to be the nearest or most senior heir to the honour but on his death this creation also became extinct.\n\nThe title of Lord Oliphant is now dormant.\n\nThe senior heir male to all four of the creations of Lord Oliphant and of Lord Aberdalgie and Lord Dupplin, is Richard Oliphant of that Ilk, the current Chief of Clan Oliphant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It addresses the fundamental questions about social life and embraces the contours of modern experience and the historical forces that have helped to shape that experience. It examines the prevailing and oppositional currents of thought; cultural representations as well as the technologies of their production and dissemination; the tensions between power and freedom, individuality and society, truth and uncertainty, creativity and order. Examples of topical concentrations include: Architecture and the social organization of space, disenchantment, peace and conflict, racial and ethnic identities, the Western canon and its critics.\n\nThe program treats common sense and conventional beliefs as points of departure rather than as predetermined points of arrival. It also supports questioning the taken-for-granted regardless of the political angle from which that questioning takes place. While critical social thought introduces a broad range of established critical genres, it also encourages imaginative thinking through synthesis and bridging tendencies of thought.\n\n"}

Just to the northeast is the walled plain Mendel, only slightly smaller than Lippmann. To the south-southeast lies the crater Petzval.\n\nAs with many lunar formations of this size, Lippmann has been eroded by subsequent impacts. The southeastern part of the rim has been overlain by the satellite crater Lippmann L, which in turn has become worn and eroded. The relatively fresh crater Lippmann Q lies across the southwest rim. The remaining rim has become worn and rounded, with a few surviving terrace-like features and the rim edge having lost their definition. The western and eastern sides of the crater in particular are nearly overlain by ejecta material.\n\nThe interior floor is relatively level, at least in the western two-thirds, but is marked by several impacts. The most notable of these is Lippmann P, located just to the southwest of the midpoint. A short chain of small craterlets lies along the southern part of the floor. The remainder is marked by a few small craterlets and pitted by tiny craters.\n\nThe terrain to the north and east of this crater are streaked with features that are radial to the huge Mare Orientale impact basin to the northeast. Also, Lippmann lies to the southwest of the Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a 630 km wide impact basin of Nectarian age (older than Orientale), and it is on the southeast margin of the Pre-Nectarian South Pole-Aitken Basin.\n\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lippmann.\n\n"}

To gain the ability to trade, in 1831 he became a naturalized Mexican citizen in what is now the state of New Mexico. He formed a partnership with American traders William, George and Charles Bent; together they established the trading post of Bent's Fort. It was the only privately held fort in the West.\n\nIn addition to his trading post business, St. Vrain formed a business partnership with Cornelio Vigil. In 1843 the two men petitioned for and received a land grant of approximately 4 million acres located in what is now southeastern Colorado. However, their plans for development of the area were halted due to the onset of the Mexican–American War, by which the United States acquired the Southwest and California.\n\nFollowing the creation of the U.S. provisional government of New Mexico in 1847, St. Vrain organized a group of volunteers who fought alongside the US Army during the Taos Revolt. After the deaths of Charles and George Bent, William Bent and St. Vrain dissolved their partnership. St. Vrain settled in Mora, New Mexico Territory. There he owned saw and flourmills and was a supplier to the U.S. Army garrison at the nearby Fort Union.\n\nCeran St. Vrain was the son of a French aristocrat who came to the United States in the late 18th century to escape the French Revolution. His father was Jacques Marcellin Ceran de Hault de Lassus Saint-Vrain (1770-1818), the third son of Pierre de Luzière. Jacques was previously an officer in the French navy and commander of the King's galiot \"La Flèche \" – the Arrow – and captain of militia. His mother was Marie Félicité Chauvet Dubreuil of St. Louis, Missouri, which had a predominately French population. His parents were married on April 30, 1796; they had a large family. One of Ceran's brothers was Felix St. Vrain. He became a US Indian agent and was killed in 1832 by the Sauk tribe, in what came to be known as the St. Vrain Massacre, during the Black Hawk War.\n\nThe family settled near St. Louis, Missouri, where Ceran was born on May 5, 1802. Jacques St. Vrain \ndied insolvent in 1818. He had never recovered from the loss of his brewery, which burned down in 1813. After his father's death, Ceran became a clerk with Bernard Pratte and Company, a trading firm located in St Louis.\n\nEager for adventure, in 1824 Ceran St. Vrain persuaded Bernard Pratte to support a trading venture to Taos, New Mexico, part of newly independent Mexico. After establishing a trading post in Taos, St. Vrain travelled between Missouri and New Mexico for several years. He also trapped near the North Platte River in Colorado. In 1830 St. Vrain was part of a caravan of traders on their way to Taos who were intercepted near the Canadian River by Colonel José Antonio Vizcarra (sometimes referred to as \"Viscarra\"). According to Ceran St. Vrain, \"The object in coming out so fare to meet us was to prevent Smuggling and it had the desired effeck.\"\n\nIn 1831, when he was living in Taos, St. Vrain became a naturalized Mexican citizen; it enable him to avoid the restrictions placed on American traders in what was then Mexican territory. He soon afterward formed a partnership with American trader William Bent. The new company was known as Bent, St. Vrain & Company; the company's trading area covered much of Wyoming, New Mexico, Kansas, and Colorado. They established company trading posts in Santa Fe and Taos, where their wagon trains made deliveries of goods shipped from Independence and Westport, Missouri. They traded cloth, glass, hardware, and tobacco for silver, furs, horses, and mules.\n\nThe Bent-St. Vrain Company built Bent's Fort, an elaborate adobe fort on the eastern Colorado plains, along the Santa Fe Trail. Bent's Fort was the only privately owned fortification in the west. It became a premier trading center and rendezvous for fur trappers. Bent's Fort has been restored and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Site. Ceran St. Vrain also helped establish what is now called Old Fort Saint Vrain, along the South Platte River.\n\nDuring the Taos Revolt, Ceran St. Vrain organized a volunteer force to support the U.S. re-taking of Taos, during the Mexican–American War. Joining more than 300 U.S. troops in Santa Fe, St. Vrain's 65 men set off for Taos. Along the way, they forced the retreat of some 1,500 Mexican and Indian rebels, who took refuge in a thick-walled adobe church in Taos Pueblo.\n\nDuring the Siege of Pueblo de Taos, Ceran St. Vrain's \"Emergency Brigade\" positioned themselves between the church and the mountains. They cut off rebel forces attempting to escape the federal troops' artillery fire and frontal assault. The mounted volunteers reportedly raided the rebels and killed a total of 51 Mexicans and Taos Indians in the fierce, close-quarter fighting that followed. St. Vrain's life was saved by one of his volunteers, a New Mexican named Manuel Chaves.\n\nCeran St. Vrain acted as the translator in the following military trial of numerous captives taken at Taos. Fifteen men -->were convicted of treason and sentenced to death. They were executed in April 1847.\n\nIn 1855, Ceran St. Vrain settled in Mora County, where he built a flour mill. He supplied flour to Fort Union in Mora Valley, north of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and to Fort Garland in southwestern Colorado. He also began publishing one of Northern New Mexico's first English-language newspapers, the \"Santa Fe Gazette\".\n\nCeran St. Vrain had at least 6 children; historians disagree on whether Ceran was legally married to all the mothers of his children. He may have taken \"country wives\" among indigenous women in New Mexico; this was typical of many fur traders.\n\nOn October 28, 1870, Ceran St. Vrain died at the home of his son Vincente in Mora. More than 2,000 people attended his funeral, which included the U.S. Army garrison from Fort Union. St. Vrain was buried in what is now named St. Vrain Cemetery in Mora.\n\nSt. Vrain Canyon, near Lyons, Colorado, and St. Vrain Creek, which flows through into the South Platte River, and St. Vrain School district in Colorado are named after him.\n\n\n"}

J. D. Wilson in command.\n\nCommissioned as hostilities in Europe and Asia began to draw the United States ever closer to the conflict, \"Mattole\" was assigned to duties in the North Atlantic. Following America’s entry into the war, the oiler plied between New York City, Boston, Naval Station Argentia, and Reykjavík, supplying fuel to both shore stations and ships. On 13 November 1942, she departed New York in convoy to Casablanca, arriving 1 December. She remained off the coast of north Africa until the 22d, fueling ships operating in support of the Allied offensives against Axis forces and their desire for control of the Mediterranean.\n\n\"Mattole\" returned to New York 10 January 1943, continued to Norfolk and then to Bermuda where she underwent intensive exercises in fueling at sea, antisubmarine, and antiaircraft procedures. With this training behind her, the tanker again joined a slow, and vulnerable, supply convoy en route to Gibraltar. The convoy encountered no difficulties and \"Mattole\" returned to the United States 16 April.\n\nOn 16 June, following overhaul at Norfolk, \"Mattole\" began making runs to the oil centers of Aruba and Curaçao. Arriving in the Netherlands West Indies on the 26th, she carried oil to Guantanamo Bay and underwent fueling exercises before taking up duties as station tanker at Port of Spain, Trinidad, 20 July. She was relieved of this duty 6 September and assigned to the important task of keeping Cuban and east coast depots supplied with petroleum products. With only one interruption, she continued this essential duty sailing to Guantanamo Bay; New York; Portland, Maine; and Argentia, Newfoundland, until mid‑1945 when she extended her operations to include gulf coast ports.\n\nThe single break in this assignment came in November 1944 when she was ordered to accompany an extremely slow convoy of landing craft and tugs towing Army barges to Cherbourg, France. The convoy departed Charleston, S.C., 6 November and arrived at Plymouth, England, without incident, 5 December. The return voyage was underway by the 12th. On the 20th an enemy submarine attacked. Two ships were lost and the U‑boat, although sighted and pursued, escaped. The remaining ships rescued survivors and the convoy continued on to New York arriving 7 January 1945. \"Mattole\" then resumed her coastal and Caribbean tanker operations.\n\nDuring her last month of active participation in the war effort, July 1945, the oiler carried her cargo between Houston, Galveston, and Cristobal, Canal Zone. On 3 August she departed Galveston for Philadelphia, docking there on the 9th. On 6 September she steamed to Norfolk where she decommissioned 25 October 1945. Struck from the Naval Register 13 November, she was transferred to the Maritime Commission, 7 June 1946. She was subsequently sold by that agency and delivered to the buyer, Boston Metals Co., Baltimore, Md., 1 July 1947.\n\n"}

The date of the first price list of the company –28 April– is set up as the company's foundation date.\nIn 1863, Guenther Wagner obtained the position of chemist and plant manager. He took over the company in 1871. Wagner algo designed the company first logo (taking the figure of a pelican from his own familiar coat of arms) in 1878, becoming also one of the first German trademarks ever. The company expanded his range of distribution to Austria, Italy, Czech Republic, Hungary and Croatia, then establishing a new factory in Vienna.\n\nBy 1881 the company had expanded its plant, employing 39 additional people. When Fritz Beindorff took over the company, Pelikan added office products for copying, stamping, sticking and erasing. In 1896, Pelikan started to produce India ink, achieving great sales success. By 1913, the manufacturing were expanded, and 1057 workers were employed by Pelikan. In 1929, Pelikan produced its first fountain pen.\n\nPelikan expanded its products to watercolor sets in 1931.

Four passenger airlines serve the airport with flights to nine cities: Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle. The airport was established in 1939 and used by the U.S. military between 1939 and 1945.\n\nIn 1933 Pacific Seaboard Air Lines single engine Bellanca CH-300s flew twice daily each way Los Angeles - Santa Barbara - Santa Maria - San Luis Obispo - Paso Robles - Monterey - Salinas - San Jose - San Francisco. Pacific Seaboard later moved its operation to the eastern U.S., was renamed Chicago and Southern Air Lines, and became a large domestic and international airline that in 1953 was acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines.\n\nEarl Thomson, along with his brothers-in-law, William \"Chris\" and David Hoover, talked county officials into leasing them the land for an airport. By April 1939 it opened with an hangar and dirt runways.\n\nDuring World War II the federal government took over the airport: From 1938 until 1941, the U.S. Army Air Corps and the California National Guard used 218 acres as an aerial observation training center; In 1940 the War Department added hard surface runways and lights, barracks, hangars, and mechanic shops. In 1940 and 1941, 183 private pilots and 20 advanced students were trained here though a federally sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program for armed services fliers. In 1943, the Navy began using the airport as a training center for the Pacific Fleet.\n\nThe federal government turned the airport back to the county in 1946. Southwest Airways started passenger flights with Douglas DC-3s that year.\n\nSouthwest's flights to San Luis Obispo ended in 1956 when the airline moved to Paso Robles Municipal Airport in northern San Luis Obispo County due to the 4000-ft runway at San Luis Obispo being too short for larger aircraft such as the Martin 4-0-4 and Fairchild F-27. Pacific Air Lines, Air West and Hughes Airwest, successors to Southwest Airways, listed San Luis Obispo in their timetables but actually served Paso Robles with F-27s until 1974.\n\nIn 1947 county supervisors contracted for another hangar, ramp, and eventually an administration building. The supervisors named Chris Hoover full-time airport manager in 1953.\n\nSan Luis Obispo Airport had no scheduled airline service from 1956 until 1969 when locally-based Swift Aire Lines began scheduled flights with Piper Navajos. Swift Aire's headquarters were at San Luis Obispo; it eventually operated Fokker F27 Friendships bought new from Fokker as well as Nord 262s and de Havilland Herons.\n\nIn 1975, after ending service to Paso Robles the year before, Hughes Airwest was operating McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s to nearby Santa Maria Public Airport to serve the San Luis Obispo area; these nonstops to Los Angeles and San Francisco soon ended.\n\nAfter the 1981 demise of Swift Aire after a merger with Golden Gate Airlines, Wings West Airlines established its headquarters in San Luis Obispo and flew several turboprop types, as an independent commuter carrier and then as American Eagle on behalf of American Airlines via a code sharing agreement. Propjets flown by Wings West to San Luis Obispo included the British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 and Jetstream 32, the Beechcraft C99, the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner (Metro III models) and the Saab 340.\n\nIn 1987 the San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport was dedicated as McChesney Field, in honor of Leroy E. McChesney for his leadership and dedication to aviation. McChesney lived in the county since 1920 and had been a pilot since 1949. He was a longtime member of the California Aviation Council, a member of the California Aeronautics Board, and the Grand Marshal of the first Airport Day in 1984.\n\nIn 1988 a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) control tower opened and SkyWest Airlines, WestAir operating as United Express and Wings West (later merged into American Eagle) were flying commuter turboprops, WestAir operating the Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante and later the BAe Jetstream 31.\n\nSeveral other commuter airlines served San Luis Obispo with turboprop flights to Los Angeles (LAX) including Delta Connection service by SkyWest with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners (Metro II and Metro III models) and Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias, Imperial Airlines with Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirantes, Mesa Airlines flying as United Express with Beechcraft 1900Cs and USAir Express operated by Trans States Airlines with BAe Jetstream 32s. As of 1996 only American Eagle and United Express remained, Delta Connection and US Air Express having left the year prior.\n\nAmerica West Express (Mesa Airlines) began flying de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8s to Phoenix in April 1999. Within a few years they had expanded to Las Vegas, and became the first airline to operate jets to the airport with the CRJ-200. The Las Vegas route was dropped shortly after the US Airways/America West merger.\n\nIn 2007 Delta Connection (Skywest) returned to San Luis Obispo, flying a CRJ-200 to Salt Lake City. The route ended in 2008. American Eagle left the airport in November 2008 as they retired their Saab 340s as part of a 12% reduction in services, and closed its base at the airport.\n\nOn August 27, 2008 US Airways Express flown by Mesa Airlines announced an expansion of service at San Luis Obispo. Beginning October 2, 2008 the Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet 900 (CRJ-900) replaced the smaller CRJ-200 on the Phoenix flights with 36 more seats on these twice-daily flights, and continues today as American Eagle service. SkyWest (United Express) now has Canadair CRJ-200s on most nonstops to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Denver, but will change to the larger ERJ-175 for one daily flight each to Los Angeles and San Francisco, and all flights to Denver. Allegiant Air considered the airport for a daily nonstop McDonnell Douglas MD-80 to Las Vegas, but the short runway at the time at SBP resulted in their service being operated from the Santa Maria Airport\n\nIn January 2009 a charter Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-400 arrived at SBP from Chico and was the largest aircraft ever to land at San Luis. The flight carried 125 members of the San Francisco Symphony arriving to perform at Cal Poly's Performing Arts Center. From April 1 to the 4th, 2009 charter Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-700s, Frontier Airlines Airbus A319s, and Southwest Airlines Boeing 737s arrived at San Luis Obispo County carrying Oregon National Guard military troops. The A319 was the largest aircraft to have ever landed at San Luis Obispo. Currently, there are no military charter operations at San Luis Obispo, however C-130 Hercules aircraft do occasionally stop at the airport. Allegiant Airlines provides charters from the airport for the Cal Poly Football team.\n\nIn October 2015 ground was broken on a new passenger terminal; it was expected that increases in the regional population and tourism would attract more service to the airport.\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Alaska Airlines (Horizon Air) began a daily Embraer ERJ-175 jet service to Seattle.\n\nOn December 13, 2018, American Airlines announced daily flights to Dallas/Fort Worth which began on April 2, 2019. The flights use American Eagle CRJ-700s and Embraer E-175s.\n\nOn June 26, 2019, Contour Airlines announced flights to Las Vegas which began October 17th, 2019 with Embraer ERJ-135s.\n\nOn September 4, 2019, Alaska Airlines announced daily flights with the ERJ-175 to Portland, Oregon (starting on June 18th, 2020), and San Diego which began January 7th, 2020.\n\nIn 2015, the airport was suspected as a possible source of trichloroethylene or TCE, which was found in nearby water wells. However, an investigation ordered by the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board and conducted by a third-party engineering firm found that the airport was not the source of contamination. Water Board staff oversaw the county's field investigation activities. An estimated 48 residents had already filed claims against the county for negligence, even though the investigation concluded that the San Luis Obispo Regional Airport is not the source.\nIn 2019, the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board confirmed that the source of TCE contamination in the Buckley Road Area was emanating from 4665 Thread Lane, which is located across Buckley Road from the airport TCE Thread Lane Report\n\nThe airport covers and has two runways:\n\nA new passenger terminal replaced the older, smaller facility towards the north end of the airfield. A ground-breaking ceremony was held on October 8, 2015, and opened on November 1, 2017. The new terminal features modern check-in counters and security screening, a pet relief area in a central courtyard, a post-security food stand, multiple gates with waiting areas, and two all-glass jet bridges in addition to the ground level gates. Artwork in the lobby includes tail sections and an engine nacelle from a Boeing 747. The airport is designed to accommodate up to 1.2 million passengers per year, well above the 450,000 seen by the airport at the time of construction.\n\nThe airport also has the Spirit of San Luis Restaurant, in the original terminal from the 1950s. It has outdoor seating for patrons to watch planes take off and land, and is popular with private pilots to \"Fly In\" for lunch.\n\nThe 1980s built terminal covers 16,000 square feet, and sits vacant with no current plans for redevelopment.\n\nThere are numerous parking spots for general aviation aircraft, and multiple FBOs, including Air San Luis and ACI Jet Center, as well as aircraft rentals and flight schools.\n\nOn July 17, 2013, US Airways Express operated by Mesa Airlines resumed Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet 900 (CRJ-900) service to San Luis Obispo from Phoenix. These flights are now operated as American Eagle by Mesa Airlines with all flights to Phoenix featuring Canadair CRJ-900 and CRJ-700 regional jets. American Eagle offers four daily flights to between San Luis Obispo Airport and Phoenix.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, SkyWest Airlines operating as United Express began flying Canadair CRJ-200s on all flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco, replacing Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias as they moved the type into retirement, so all scheduled passenger airline flights at San Luis Obispo are now operated with regional jets for the first time. The daily flights to Denver, as well as two of the flights to Los Angeles and one flight to San Francisco, will be operated with Embraer 175s beginning April 9, 2018, promising more comfort and higher capacity.\n\nAlaska Airlines announced new nonstop service between Seattle and San Luis Obispo which began on April 13, 2017 and was originally flown by SkyWest Airlines with Embraer 175s. Alaska Airlines subsidiary Horizon Air took over this code share service on June 9, 2017. In September 2019, the airline announced plans to fly nonstop service to San Diego beginning January 7, 2020 and to Portland, OR beginning June 18, 2020.\n\nDelta briefly operated a CRJ-200 between San Luis Obispo and Salt Lake City International Airport between 2007 and 2008, until shelving the flights due to the recession.\n\nWith the terminal upgrades, it is now theoretically possible to operate mainline aircraft into the airport such as the Airbus A319 or Boeing 717 which would allow higher capacity flights to destinations like Denver, Phoenix, or Seattle, or longer flights to destinations such as Houston or Chicago, but the runway is not long enough for these aircraft at MTOW.\n\n\n\nThe airport is located along Broad Street (State Route 227) at Aero Drive, southeast of Downtown San Luis Obispo. Parking is available across four parking lots within walking distance of the terminal. Parking is charged either hourly or daily; there are no separate long-term, short-term, or economy parking lots like many other major airports.\n\nSLO Transit is the public transportation system that serves the airport. Taxis, Lyft, and Uber also provide service.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2046230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046230", "title": "History of Spain (1975–present)", "text": "History of Spain (1975–present)\n\nFor all intents and purposes, the history of contemporary Spain began with the death of caudillo Francisco Franco on 20 November 1975, the accession of King Juan Carlos I to the throne and the establishment of the parliamentary monarchy. In 1978, the current Spanish Constitution of 1978 was signed and the status of Spain's autonomous entities (\"autonomías\") was defined.\n\nIn the uncertainty after Franco's death, the political situation could have taken one of three turns:\n\n\nIn his coronation speech, the King had opened the possibility for reform along the lines of constitutional monarchy. However, for this to be possible, high-ranking officials from the previous regime had to be ejected from power.\n\nThe first act the King did was to name Torcuato Fernández Miranda, his old teacher, as the President of the Cortes and of the Consejo del Reino. This gave the King control over the Cortes and provided him with critical assistance to dismantle the old regime within a legal framework. Torcuato Fernández Miranda was despised by the falangists and was a staunch supporter of reform.\n\nThe new government included many \"reformists\" like Manuel Fraga, who was the visible head of the government. Manuel Fraga often argued with the opposition (even imprisoning leaders of the \"Platijunta\", a hybrid coalition of the Junta Democrática and the Plataforma de Convergencia Democrática), whom he wanted to get out of the way. Fraga preferred \"slow evolution\" into democracy, unlike the King.\n\nCarlos Arias Navarro consistently impeded the King's wishes of accelerating reform. As a result, the King had to get rid of him, as it seemed he had caved in under pressure from the \"bunker\".\n\nWhereas the King could not dismiss Carlos Arias Navarro based on still relevant laws from Francoist Spain, in an interview with \"Newsweek\" on 26 April 1976, the King expressed his discontent with Arias. In June 1976, Arias signed his resignation. Adolfo Suárez took his place as the President of the Government on 3 July 1976. Suárez came from a Franquist background, so as a result he could not count on the support of the old regime \"bunker\", the reformists or the opposition. After Fraga declined to participate in the new government, lesser known politicians formed the new Cabinet. Adolfo Suárez was a staunch supporter of the King's reform policies.\n\nAs these events unfolded, a lesser amnesty was conceded to political prisoners of the old regime. Next, Suárez took it upon himself to reform the Cortes and to establish the legal framework for the elections. Suárez's new government wrote the Political Reform Act in 1977. It called for the Cortes to be divided into two Chambers, consisting of a Congress with 350 members and a Senate with 201. After being pressured by the King and by Suárez, the Cortes signed their own demise and approved the reform, which was held to test with a popular referendum. An overwhelming majority approved the change (94% in favour).\n\nThis law required the government to convoke general elections, but it had to legalise political parties first. They were in fact legalised soon after, with the limitation that their manifestos had to abide by the law. On 23 March 1977, the laws regulating elections were published in the BOE, thus officially coming into effect. A wide amnesty was also proclaimed on 17 March.\n\nViolence was not uncommon. The most striking event was the 1977 Atocha massacre, where five people working for Comisiones Obreras (a trade union affiliated to the Communist Party) were murdered by right-wing extremists. There was also violence from left-wing groups, like ETA (which continued to campaign violently for the independence of the Basque Country) or new groups like GRAPO, a Maoist group, or MPAIAC, a Canarian independence group.\n\nThe Spanish Communist Party was legalised on Holy Saturday (9 April) to prevent the military from reacting. This led to the resignation of the Minister of the Navy and an Army General. Santiago Carrillo, the Communist Party Secretary, had renounced republicanism and the Republican flag.\n\nOn 14 May, don Juan de Borbón renounced his rights to the throne in favour of Juan Carlos in La Zarzuela. Shortly after, Torcuato Fernández Miranda resigned due to political differences with Adolfo Suárez. Fernández Miranda wanted to establish a system similar to that of the United States, with a centre-left and a centre-right party alternating in power.\n\nElections, which took place on 15 June 1977, produced the following results for Spanish Congress:\n\n\nAfter the elections, it was necessary to write up a constitution for the new Spain. Since the 1931 constitution was republican and now Juan Carlos I was appointed king by Franco, a new one was necessary. The pre-constitutional project was written up by a commission consisting of deputies of all main political groups except PNV. After several months of discussion, a consensus was reached between several parties, and the Constitution was sent to the Cortes for approval. After this, it was put on a referendum on 6 December 1978 and was approved by 58% of the total census, with an 8% negative vote and 33% abstention. It was signed by the King on 27 December and took effect after its publication in the Spanish BOE (Official State Bulletin) on 29 December 1978.\n\nThe constitution granted the right for historical communities to form autonomous regions in Spain. The first regions to do this were the Basque Country and Catalonia, and soon after other regions joined, making up the modern map of Spain. This was widely criticised by the army and by right wing groups, which thought the unity of Spain was compromised, and it is still a source of argument today.\n\nOn November 1978, information services had been alerted to a possible coup d'état whose objective was to form a \"National Salvation\" government and arrest Suárez. This was called Operación Galaxia. On March 1979 new elections were called with the following results for the Congress of Deputies:\n\nCD was the new name for Fraga's Alianza Popular, and CiU was a coalition of conservative Catalan parties.\n\nUCD was a conglomerate party with many factions, as it was built from the existing government by Adolfo Suárez. This conglomerate started showing divisions with the arguments about laws on divorce and especially in the autonomous statutes. The pressure from opposing factions and from the opposition wore down Adolfo Suárez until he resigned from the party and also resigned from his position as President of the Government. Suárez publicly announced his resignation in TVE, on 25 June 1981. This was a surprise for most people, as it was a completely unexpected move from Suárez.\n\nThe next UCD congress in February took place amongst great tension. Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo was voted candidate for the Presidency of the Government for UCD and was to be invested President on 23 February.\nOn the day of his investiture, Antonio Tejero broke into the Congress and held all deputies at gunpoint. The army's discontent was caused because of the autonomous statutes which they thought compromised Spain's unity. However, this coup d'état failed because the King called for the military powers to obey legal civilian authority. The next morning, Tejero surrendered, and the democracy was saved.\n\nIn October 1981, entry to NATO was approved in Congress with the open opposition of left-wing groups. The Socialist Party PSOE, the main opposition party, promised a referendum on NATO if it (PSOE) got into government. New elections were called in which the UCD suffered a heavy loss, giving PSOE a huge majority in both the Senate and the Congress of Deputies. PSOE during this time also abandoned Marxist ideology in favour of more moderate tendencies. The massive gain of CP, led by Manuel Fraga, was caused by the disappearance of UCD from the political spectrum.\n\nResults for Congress of Deputies:\n\nThe PSOE was the first party to rule over Spain with a majority in the history of Spain's democracy. The transition to democracy was said to be completed here because a centre-left party took over the government from a centre-right party with no consequences.\n\nFelipe González became Prime Minister (\"Presidente del Gobierno\" in Spanish) after PSOE's victory in the elections. PSOE at that time, though it had renounced its Marxist ideology, still had a populist current, led by Alfonso Guerra, as opposed to a neo-liberal one, led by Miguel Boyer. This would cause divisions in the party which would not show up until years later.\n\nIn González's first term, several measures were adopted, but with moderation – something that contrasted with their program, which was much more radical. The main bills passed in this period were legalized abortion, increased personal freedoms, and a reorganization of the education in Spain. In addition, however, this period marked the appearance of the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación (GAL), mercenary counter-terrorist forces organised and paid by the government which assassinated various terrorists, and the expropriation of RUMASA, a trust operated by a member of Opus Dei. Also during this period, Spain joined the European Economic Community, and a referendum (as promised by PSOE) was called on Spain remaining in NATO on 12 March 1986. This time, however, the socialists campaigned in favour of NATO, the parties to the left of PSOE campaigned against NATO, and the right, led by Manuel Fraga, campaigned for abstention. In the referendum, the Spanish population opted to remain in NATO with a 52.2% vote in favour, but with considerable abstention.\n\nElections were called on 28 June 1986 for both chambers.\n\nPSOE maintained its majority in both chambers, but it lost some seats, and CDS, the new centre party led by Adolfo Suárez, became the third party. Izquierda Unida (IU) is a conglomerate of left-wing parties led by the PCE. Lastly, Herri Batasuna (HB) is a Basque separatist political party, recently banned for its ties to ETA.\n\nPSOE's majority meant it could pass laws without the need for consensus between all the political parties. So, there was great stability, but there was no real parliament debate. There was practically no political opposition, but a social opposition started growing in the end of the 80s, consisting of two fronts: the student front, and the syndicalist front. This last front exerted a great amount of pressure, even calling for a general strike on 14 December 1988, due to the liberalizing of the economic policies. On this day, eight million Spaniards did not go to work, which accounted for 90% of the total work force in Spain. Faced with these problems, PSOE had to call for elections one year earlier, on 29 October 1989.\n\nPSOE stood just on the border of the majority now (175 seats of 350), but it was able to pass laws because of the absence of HB's deputies. People's Party (PP) was the new name for CP, and it became consolidated as the second largest party. From 1991, PSOE started losing its urban vote in favour of PP, adding this to various scandals: the FILESA case, an organization built to illegally raise funds for PSOE, influence peddling and prevarication cases, internal divisions between the populist and the liberal currents started showing up. Under these conditions, elections were called on 6 June 1993 with the following results:\n\nPSOE managed to achieve a relative majority despite all the corruption and scandals. However, it had to draw a deal with CiU, a Catalan centre-right party. This caused frequent tensions and accusations from the opposition that PSOE was giving more money and power to Catalonia in exchange for CiU's support. Coalicion Canaria (CC) was formed by a conglomerate of liberal Canarian regionalist parties.\n\nThis legislature was a failure due to the vulnerability to the continuous attacks from the opposition and new corruption scandals – the most famous one was the Guardia Civil's director, Luis Roldán. Facing this, PSOE had to call for early elections on 3 March 1996.\n\nPP won these elections and was able to enter the government after acquiring support from the various Catalan, Canarian and Basque groups.\n\nJosé María Aznar became prime minister of Spain thanks to the support from CiU, PNV, and CC. During his first term, his main objective was an economic policy to allow convergence with the euro, and several public enterprises were privatized.\n\nElections were held in Spain on 12 March 2000, and the PP obtained a majority of seats:\nIn his second term, without needing the support from the autonomic parties, Aznar was able to apply his party's program more freely, but not without controversy.\n\nAgain, the government's focus was on economy, and some of its reforms were strongly criticized by the syndicates. The economic policy caused an increase in the price of butane, gasoline, and tobacco, that led to an increase in the price of other goods that increased with the arrival of euro.\n\nThe most controversial aspects of this second term were:\n\nAznar is also said to have had a more tense relationship with the King, unlike his predecessor, whose friendship with the King still lasts today.\n\nOne of the most peculiar events of his second term was when Spain and Morocco had some disagreements about Perejil Island, an island with an area less than a square kilometer, near the coast of Morocco. Morocco brought some forces to that island. After some days of diplomatic conversations, Morocco didn't withdraw the few troops that were there. Finally, Spain brought a helicopter and some troops to the island, and drove them back to Morocco.\n\nEven though Spanish laws do not limit the terms in office of a President, Aznar voluntarily decided to not run for a third term. Interior Minister Mariano Rajoy was elected by his party as new leader. While initial polls gave him good chances of winning, the campaign's last weeks and the Madrid train bombings on 11 March 2004, just three days before elections took place, changed the tide of the vote.\n\nInternally and outwards, the attacks were seen as the result of Spain support to the US in the Iraq War.\n\nThe election was held on 14 March 2004 and PSOE, led by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, won a plurality of seats in Congress of Deputies, and was able to form a government with the support of minor parties.\n\nBecause he failed to secure a majority in the 2004 election, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero became prime minister with the support of IU, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Canarian Coalition (CC). This is not a coalition, however, and each law must be individually negotiated.\n\nAs promised during the electoral campaign, Zapatero removed all Spanish soldiers from Iraq. His government also approved a same-sex marriage law for Spain. This law was supported by the majority of the Spanish population. However, the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives, many of whom were associated with the Partido Popular, strongly opposed it.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, in the international arena Zapatero was more supportive of the United Nations.\n\nHis relations with the United States became strained following the withdrawal of Spanish forces from Iraq, and the new relationship Zapatero built with two of the Iraq War's most vocal critics, France and Germany, until those countries elected new leaders. As Zapatero had vocally supported the incumbents, he strained relationships with the new leaders.\n\nMariano Rajoy became prime minister after his party gained a majority in the 2011 elections. His tenure has been marked by the continuation of the financial crisis and the application of harsh austerity measures and spending cuts, as well as the adoption of a new labor law reform in early 2012 which resulted in 2 general strikes that year. The eruption of a major party illegal financing scandal has eroded his government's popularity.\n\nDuring the term of Rajoy, Carles Puigdemont declared the independence of Catalonia amid the 2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis and happened the 2017 Barcelona-Cambrils terrorist attacks.\n\n"}

Mr. Pell was given permission to organize the show by Charles and June Gelish, who owned the property. With the help of Will Hoppey, Rich organized all aspects of the concert from ordering water trucks to working out who would perform on the stage. Rich also emceed the festival.\n\nThe whole event was spontaneous. Anyone was invited to perform regardless of skill levels, and the majority of performers were lesser-known bands. Wavy Gravy, the Woodstock All-Stars, and Al Hendrix, the father of Jimi Hendrix, appeared at the concert. Wayne Thiel played a small set of Hendrix material shortly before Al Hendrix came onto the stage. The band was called \"Head First\".\n\nThe gathering took place on the same days in August as the original festival, even though in 1989 this fell in the middle of the week.\n\nA total lunar eclipse occurred during the concert on the night of August 16–17. Musicians worked the lunar eclipse into performances; one sang his own version of Man's \"Call Down the Moon\". The actual performer \"calling down the moon\" was Jack Hardy in his song \"The Hunter\".\n\nAlthough the property owners briefly attempted to charge $5 for parking, and a few people had made up simple T-shirts and simple food to sell at the event, there was virtually none of the commercialism that later marked the Woodstock '94 and Woodstock '99 concerts.\n\nThe event had not been promoted other than by word of mouth, and at first it appeared there would be no stage, no lighting, and few performers until volunteers began bringing them in. Food and beverages were not sold; participants brought their own supplies and bartered with each other.\n\nBy the weekend the stage and sound system had grown to accommodate the large crowd. Members of the band Ice Nine (John Gaechter & Vince Lisanti) supplied their PA system and organized people to help build a larger stage. Performers included Melanie Safka and Savoy Brown, as well as many local artists including Will Hoppey, Ice Nine, Rich Pell, The Psychedelic Kitchen, Target, Billy Mitchell, and Jack Hardy. The concert was recorded by Barry Benson and was available as \"20th Anniversary Festival: A Musical Documentary of Woodstock '89\". \"An estimated 150,000 people passed by, or stopped to participate in the celebration of the 1969 concert,\" as reported by the \"Sullivan County Democrat\" on August 22, 1989.\n\nBecause participants were allowed to park vehicles next to their tents all across the site except in the main performance area, much of the field that was so densely covered by people in 1969 was filled again by this event, but this time by cars, psychedelic buses and upscale RV's as well.\n\nSantana declined to play Woodstock 89 but would resume at Woodstock 94. \n\nABC's morning program \"Good Morning America\" broadcast live from Max Yasgur's Farm, interviewing Wavy Gravy and Ken Kesey.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2046242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046242", "title": "Domesticated red fox", "text": "Domesticated red fox\n\nThe domesticated red fox is a form of the wild red fox (\"Vulpes vulpes\") which has been domesticated to an extent under laboratory conditions. They are the result of an experiment which was designed to demonstrate the power of selective breeding to transform species, as described by Charles Darwin in \"On the Origin of Species\". The experiment explored whether selection for behaviour rather than morphology may have been the process that had produced dogs from wolves, by recording the changes in foxes when in each generation only the most tame foxes were allowed to breed. Many of the descendant foxes became both tamer and more dog-like in morphology.\n\nThe program was started in 1959 in the Soviet Union by zoologist Dmitry Belyayev and it has been in continuous operation since. Today, the experiment is under the supervision of Lyudmila Trut in Russia, at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk.\n\nIn 2020, a review found that the results of the \"Farm fox experiment\" had been overstated, and that the \"wild\" population it was based on had originated from a captive population from Canada that had been bred there since the 1800s.\n\nThe experiment was initiated by scientists who were interested in the topic of domestication and the process by which wolves became domesticated dogs. They saw some retention of juvenile traits by adult dogs, both morphological ones, such as skulls that were unusually broad for their length, and behavioral ones, such as whining, barking, and submission.\n\nIn a time when centralized political control in the fields of genetics and agriculture promoted Lysenkoism as an official state doctrine, Belyayev's commitment to classical genetics had cost him his job as head of the Department of Fur Animal Breeding at the Central Research Laboratory of Fur Breeding in Moscow in 1948. During the 1950s, he continued to conduct genetic research under the guise of studying animal physiology.\n\nBelyayev believed that the key factor selected for in the domestication of dogs was not size or fertility, but behavior: specifically, tameability. Since behavior is rooted in biology, selecting for tameness and against aggression means selecting for physiological changes in the systems that govern the body's hormones and neurochemicals.\n\nBelyayev decided to test his theory by domesticating red foxes; in particular the silver fox, a dark-colored mutation of the red fox. He placed a population of them under strong selection pressure for inherent tameness. According to Trut: \n\nBelyayev and Trut believed that selecting for tameness mimics the natural selection that must have occurred in the ancestral past of dogs, and, more than any other quality, must have determined how well an animal would adapt to life among humans.\n\nRussian scientists achieved a population of domesticated red foxes that are fundamentally different in temperament and behavior from their wild forebears. Some important changes in physiology and morphology became visible, such as mottled or spotted colored fur. Some scientists believe that these changes obtained from selection for tameness are caused by lower adrenaline production in the new population, causing physiological changes within relatively few generations yielding genetic combinations not present in the original species. This indicates that selection for tameness (e.g. did not flee) produces changes that are related to the emergence of other dog-like traits (e.g. raised tail, coming into heat every six months rather than annually). These seemingly unrelated changes are a result of pleiotropy.\n\nThe project also bred the least-tameable foxes to study social behavior in canids. These foxes avoided human contact, as do their wild behavioral phenotypes.\n\nSimilar research was carried out in Denmark with American minks.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Soviet Union, the project ran into serious financial problems. In 2014, officials stated that the number of foxes was never reduced and is still stable at about 2,000. , there are 270 tame vixens and 70 tame males on the farm.\n\nIn another published study, a system of measuring fox behavior was described that is expected to be useful in QTL mapping to explore the genetic basis of tame and aggressive behavior in foxes.\n\nThe sculpture \"Dmitriy Belyaev and the Domesticated Fox\" was built near Institute of Cytology and Genetics (Novosibirsk) the honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Dmitry Konstantinovich Belyaev. The tamed fox gives the scientist a paw and wags its tail. Konstantin Zinich, sculptor (Krasnoyarsk) says \"The philosophy of touching a fox and a man is rapprochement, kindness, there is no aggression from the fox – it was wild, and he made it genetically domesticated.\"\n\nDomesticated red foxes exhibit a variety of coat color mutations, including red, cross, silver (black), platinum, and Georgian white, the lattermost being a color exclusive to the Russian breeding project.\n\nArchaeologists have discovered evidence of red fox breeding in the late Iron Age on Orkney, off the northern coast of Scotland.

{"id": "2046252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046252", "title": "Le Samouraï", "text": "Le Samouraï\n\nLe Samouraï (; ; originally released as The Godson in the US) is a 1967 neo-noir crime film written and directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. The film follows a professional hitman named Jef Costello who is seen by witnesses and his efforts to provide himself an alibi that drive him further into a corner. The film stars Alain Delon, Francois Perier, Nathalie Delon and Cathy Rosier.\n\nThe film was released on 25 October 1967, receiving positive reviews with praise for Melville's screenwriting and direction, and Delon's performance and atmosphere. The film grossed over $1.2 million in France and over $0.75m across Spain.\n\nHitman Jef Costello (Delon) lives in a single-room Paris apartment whose spartan furnishings include a little bird in a cage. A long opening shot shows him lying on his bed, smoking, when the following (invented) quotation appears on-screen:\n\nCostello's methodical modus operandi includes airtight alibis involving his lover, Jane (Nathalie Delon). Having carried out a murder contract on a nightclub owner, he is seen leaving the scene by several witnesses, including piano player Valérie (Cathy Rosier). Their statements are inconsistent but the investigating officer (François Périer) believes Costello is his man based on the witnesses who viewed Costello and his alibi that he was with Jane the whole time.\n\nCostello loses a police tail and gets to a meeting point on a subway overpass to get paid by his employers. There he is shot and wounded by a man sent by his employers. Having bandaged his wound and rested, he returns to the nightclub and goes for a car drive with the piano player. He is grateful to her, but does not understand why she protected him from the police when she was the key witness to the murder. In the meantime, police officers bug his room, which agitates the bird in its cage. Upon returning, Costello notices some loose feathers scattered around the cage and the bird acting strangely. Suspecting an intrusion, he searches his room, finds the bug and deactivates it.\n\nIn the meantime, the police ransack Jane's apartment and offer her a deal: withdraw her alibi for Costello and they will leave her alone. Jane rejects the offer and shows them the door. Back in his apartment Costello finds himself held at gunpoint by the overpass shooter, who gives him money and offers him a new contract. The intended target is not revealed to the audience. Costello overpowers him and forces him to disclose the identity of his boss, Olivier Rey (Jean-Pierre Posier).\n\nFollowing a chase scene in the Métro by several disguised cops and a goodbye visit to Jane, he drives to Rey's home, which turns out to be the house where the piano player lives. Costello kills Rey and drives to the nightclub. This time he makes no attempt to conceal his presence. He even checks his hat but leaves his hat-check ticket on the counter. Having put on his white gloves in full view of everyone, he walks over to the stage where Valérie advises him to leave. When he pulls out his gun and points it at her, she quietly asks \"Why, Jef?\" and he replies, \"I was paid to.\" After a moment of tension, the audience hears gunshots, but they are not from his gun. Costello falls to the ground and dies. A junior police officer tells Valérie she is lucky the police were there because otherwise Costello would have killed her. But when his boss picks up Costello’s gun, it is revealed that he had removed all the bullets before entering the club.\n\nIn an interview with Rui Nogueira, Melville indicated that he had shot an alternate version of Costello's death scene. In the alternative ending, which was the original version, Costello meets his death with a picture-perfect grin à la Delon. The scene was changed to its current form when Melville angrily discovered that Delon had already used a smiling death scene in another of his films. Still images of the smiling death exist.\n\n\nMeville wrote the film specifically for Delon.\n\n\"Le Samourai\" was released on 25 October 1967. The film went on to receive positive reviews with praise for Melville's screenwriting and direction, Delon's performance and atmosphere. In Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% \"Fresh\" based on 30 reviews, with the site's critical consensus writing; \"\"Le Samouraï\" makes the most of its spare aesthetic, using stylish -- and influential -- direction, solid performances, and thick atmosphere to weave an absorbing story\".\n\nIn IMDB, the film received a rating of 8.1/10 based on 40,515 votes.\n\nRoger Ebert had granted the film four out of four in his review, writing; Like a painter or a musician, a filmmaker can suggest complete mastery with just a few strokes. Jean-Pierre Melville involves us in the spell of \"Le Samourai\" (1967) before a word is spoken. He does it with light: a cold light, like dawn on an ugly day. And color: grays and blues. And actions that speak in place of words\", with Ebert even granting the film his title of \"Great Movie\".\n\nThe film grossed over $1.2 million in France and over $797,011 across Spain. In its first weekend in France, it grossed $509,729 based on Euro, with 669,402 Euros and 18,878 thousand euros.\n\nThe film has influenced other works:\n\n\nThe film was ranked #39 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. It holds a 100% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews from critics, and a rating average of 8.47/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"\"Le Samouraï\" makes the most of its spare aesthetic, using stylish – and influential – direction, solid performances, and thick atmosphere to weave an absorbing story.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It is located southwest of the Monti Sabatini, within the Regional Park of Veii. The communal territory is mostly composed by tuff, and is intensively cultivated.\n\nThe area has been settled since prehistoric times. As an Italian comune, it includes some of the archaeological sites associated with the powerful former Etruscan city of Veii, which rivaled Rome for a time, north of the village of Isola Farnese, south of Formello. Settlement in the region declined after Veii's destruction in 396 BC.\n\nIn this area, about 780 AD, with peaceful conditions reestablished, Pope Adrian I assembled a great estate of which this territory formed part, his \"Domusculta Capracorum\", in contrast with the power of the Abbey of Farfa, but it was destroyed by Saracen attacks in the ninth century. The domus' territories included a \"fundus Formellum\", where a settlement developed that was first mentioned in 1027.\n\nIn the 11th century it was a possession of the Roman Basilica of San Paolo fuori le Mura, and was probably fortified in the same period.

Allan Hancock Field) is three miles (5 km) south of Santa Maria, in northern Santa Barbara County, California.\n\nThe airport was built by the United States Army during World War II, known as Santa Maria Army Air Field. Its primary mission was to provide training for B-24 bomber pilots, however flight training was abandoned by December 1942. The field fell into a state of disuse until the arrival of the Lockheed P-38 twin engine fighter in September 1943.\n\nDuring its use by the military Santa Maria AAF also controlled Estrella Army Airfield, near Paso Robles as an auxiliary airfield to support the pilot training activity.\n\nAfter the war Santa Barbara County and the city of Santa Maria acquired the land and facilities through two grants in 1948. In 1964 the Army Air Field was renamed Santa Maria Public Airport.\n\nIn 2020, the airport was again used for training by a fleet of military jets while Naval Air Station Point Mugu was performing maintenance. The fleet consisted of six 1960 British Strike Fighter jets and two 1970 Israeli Interceptor jets.\n\nThe first airline at Santa Maria was Pacific Seaboard Air Lines. In 1933 Pacific Seaboard scheduled two daily Bellanca CH-300s Los Angeles - Santa Barbara - Santa Maria - San Luis Obispo - Paso Robles - Monterey - Salinas - San Jose - San Francisco. Pacific Seaboard would later move its entire operation to the eastern U.S., be renamed Chicago and Southern Air Lines, and in 1953 be acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines. Southwest Airways Douglas DC-3s began service during the 1940s. The June 1, 1947 timetable lists three daily round trips Los Angeles-Oxnard-Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-San Luis Obispo-Coalinga-Monterey-Santa Cruz/Watsonville-San Jose/Moffett Field-San Francisco. Southwest changed its name to Pacific Air Lines and operated Martin 4-0-4s and Fairchild F-27s to Santa Maria in the 1960s. Pacific merged with Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines to form Air West which became Hughes Airwest which served Santa Maria with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s and Fairchild F-27s. The Oct. 26, 1975 Hughes Airwest timetable listed DC-9 nonstops to Los Angeles and San Francisco and nonstop F-27s to LAX. This was the only time Santa Maria had nonstop mainline jets to LAX and SFO at the same time; DC-9 flights ended in a few months and Hughes Airwest F-27 flights to Santa Maria ended in 1979.\n\nA number of commuter airlines served the airport. In 1968 Cable Commuter Airlines was flying de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters to LAX. At one point in the early 1980s Swift Aire Lines, based at nearby San Luis Obispo Airport, was the only airline flying nonstop between Santa Maria and Los Angeles, mainly with new Fokker F27 Friendships. Swift Aire also operated Nord 262s and de Havilland Herons to the airport. Other commuter airlines included Sun Aire Lines with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners, Santa Barbara-based Apollo Airways (which changed its name to Pacific Coast Airlines) flying Handley Page HP.137 Jetstreams, Wings West Airlines operating as American Eagle with Beechcraft C99s, Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners, BAe Jetstream 31s, and Saab 340s, West Air flying as United Express with BAe Jetstream 31s and Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirantes and Mesa Air also operating as United Express with Beechcraft 1900Cs.\n\nThe airport covers and has two asphalt runways: 12/30, 8,004 x 150 ft (2,439 x 46 m) and 2/20, 5,189 x 75 ft (1,582 x 23 m).\n\nIn 2007 the airport had 62,480 aircraft operations, average 171 per day: 79% general aviation, 19% air taxi, 2% military and <1% airline. 243 aircraft are based at the airport: 83% single-engine, 7% multi-engine, 6% helicopter, 3% jet, <1% glider and <1% ultralight.\n\nA runway extension opened on May 3, 2012, from 6,304 ft. to 8,004 ft.\n\nAllegiant Air flies Airbus A319s nonstop to Las Vegas, four per week each way. In 2012 Allegiant Air briefly operated weekly Boeing 757-200s Santa Maria to Honolulu.\n\nA baggage claim facility opened in 2007. It was one of the first airports on the Central Coast to use a state of the art baggage carousel, on a small scale.\n\nA new terminal holding room that opened February 2008. The old area had room for 30 passengers. Designed for the Allegiant Air flights, the new holding room accommodates 200 passengers and has room for a cafe.\n\nSkyWest Airlines operating as United Express flew Bombardier CRJ-200s nonstop to San Francisco (SFO), a hub for United. Skywest began flights to Santa Maria in 1984 when it acquired Sun Aire Lines. SkyWest began flying as Delta Connection from SMX in the late 1980s via a code sharing agreement with Delta Air Lines operating Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners before becoming a United Express carrier. SkyWest had previously operated United Express service nonstop to Los Angeles with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias; flights to LAX were discontinued in favor of nonstop Canadair regional jets to SFO for United. SkyWest operating as United Express ceased operations at Santa Maria from 2015 until June 4th, 2020, when they will resume operations with flights to Los Angeles, Denver, and San Francisco with CRJ-200 aircraft. \n\nMokulele Airlines Cessna 208 Caravans replaced the SkyWest/United Express service to Los Angeles (LAX); In 2016, Mokulele moved its flights to the Los Angeles area to Burbank and dropped Santa Maria on November 30, 2017.\n\nThe extended runway at Santa Maria is paved to 8,004 feet, giving the airport the longest civil runway between Los Angeles and San Jose on the central coast (Bakersfield's primary runway at Meadows Field in the Central Valley (10855 x 150 ft.) and Vandenberg AFB's runway (15000 x 200 ft.) are longer).\n\nNov 2007 to October 2008: 56,553 passengers (SkyWest), 53,294 passengers (Allegiant), total 109,847 passengers.\nNov 2008 to October 2009, 48,117 passengers (SkyWest), 37,570 passengers (Allegiant), total 85,687 passengers. SkyWest operating as United Express has since ceased all service into Santa Maria.\n\nThe airport is located south of Santa Maria along Skyway Drive at Terminal Drive. Both US 101 and State Route 135 (Broadway) can be reached from the airport by heading north on Skyway Drive and then turning east onto Betteravia Road. Short and long-term parking is available, but passenger vehicles left more than 14 days must obtain prior approval by the Airport Administration.\n\nThe airport is served by Santa Maria Area Transit routes 4 and the Breeze, the Santa Maria Cab Company, Lyft, Uber, and other local services.\n\nThe original Allan Hancock Field was established in 1927 at another location, between Jones Street to the north, Stowell Road to the south, Bradley Road to the east and Miller Street to the west. The airport housed the Allan Hancock College of Aeronautics operated by the Hancock Foundation of Aeronautics. Before World War II, it was one of eight civil training military aviation cadets. After the war the field was used by the University of Southern California for their 4-year Aeronautics Degree program. In 1958 a bond was passed allowing Santa Maria Junior College to purchase the land, much of which would become the campus of what is now known as Allan Hancock College. The name of the original Santa Maria Airport and Hancock's name then transferred to the other, now public airport in town.\n\n\n"}

Fler had five feature parts on Bushido's first studio album, \"Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline\", released July 2003.\n\nFler released his first solo album, \"Neue Deutsche Welle\", on 1 May 2005. The first single was \"NDW 2005\", with a sample of Falco's \"Rock Me Amadeus\". The album was considered controversial due to perceived right-wing extremist lyrics.\n\nIn 2010, he released a second solo album entitled \"Trendsetter\". The first single \"Papa ist zurück\" reached  23 in Germany and No. 32 in Austria. The second single \"Cüs Junge\" was less successful; it reached No. 50 in Germany and No. 2000 in Austria.\n\nOn 25 January 2008, Fler released his third solo album, \"Fremd im eigenen Land\". The choice of the title was controversial due to a 1993 song of the same name by Advanced Chemistry. There was also a 2007 album, \"Airmax Muzik\".\n\nFler had been in a quarrel with Bushido. After the Aggro Berlin recording label closed, he contacted Bushido and they officially showed their reconciliation with a photo shoot and interview for \"Bravo HipHop Special\".\nThey created another collaborative album, \"Carlo, Cokxxx, Nutten 2\". Its only single, \"Eine Chance/Zu Gangsta\", was released on 28 August 2009 and reached No. 26 in Germany and Austria.\nThe album was released on 11 September and reached No. 3 in the Media Control Charts. Bushido stated on the album's website that he \"never believed\" it would have such success considering the lack of promotion or digital release.\n\nFler's fifth album, \"Flersguterjunge\", was released in June 2010 over ersguterjunge.\n\nOn 11 February 2011, the song \"Nie an mich geglaubt\" from Fler's sixth album, \"Airmax Muzik II\", was leaked on the Internet as digital single with two remixes, an instrumental version and video shot in New York City. The single entered the German charts at No. 64. The album was released on 8 April through Fler's record label, Maskulin, and reached No. 6 on the charts on the 17th calendar week of 2011 (25 April – 1 May).\nThe premium edition featured two bonus songs and a 30-minute DVD about the rapper's childhood, with private photos and home movies, and interviews with his stepfather, Shizoe, Silla and others.\n\nFler's eighth solo album, \"Hinter blauen Augen\", was released on 2 November 2012 and reached No. 3 in Germany. Music videos were made for the songs \"Nummer 1\", \"Hinter blauen Augen\", \"La Vida Loca\" and \"Du bist es wert\".

The single rose to No. 68 on the German charts.\nOn 19 April 2013, the album \"Blaues Blut\" was released on Maskulin, and reached No. 3 on the German charts.\n\nFler has cited several American rappers as his influences including Mobb Deep, 50 Cent, Lunatic and Juelz Santana.\n\nIn March 2010, Fler opened his clothing store Psalm 23, in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. The shop was later renamed Flerstore. In December 2011, the brick-and-mortar store was closed in favor of online sales for clothing and merchandise. Since 2013, he has also established his own line of collections for his fashion brand, Maskulin.\n\nOn 27 September 2007 at 18:00, after co-hosting \"MTV TRL: Urban show\", Fler was attacked by three unknown men armed with knives. One of his bodyguards was able to hold them off, while Fler left through the rear entrance. Nobody was harmed.\n\nIn 2004, Eko Fresh released the diss track \"Die Abrechnung\" (), that mainly attacks Kool Savas, but also referred to various German rappers, including Bushido, Sido and Fler.\n\nIn December 2004, Fler responded with \"Hollywoodtürke\" (), which mocked Eko Fresh as a \"wanna be gangster\" and also references the label Royal Bunker and rapper Bushido.\n\nBig Derill, Marcus Staiger and Boba Fettt of Royal Bunker responded with \"Wer? Fler?\" () and Eko Fresh with \"FLERräter\" (a wordplay on \"verräter\", meaning \"traitor\"), a track from his mixtape \"Fick noch immer deine Story\", that also features Bushido.\nThe feud continued as Fler and B-Tight dissed Eko Fresh on the track \"Du Opfer\" ().\n\nEko Fresh released a diss track titled \"F.L.E.R.\" in 2006, rapping over the beat of his single \"L.O.V.E.\". Fler responded on his 2007 mixtape \"Airmax Muzik\", mentioning Eko Fresh on some tracks. After that, both rappers kept quiet for some time. In 2011, Fler name-dropped Eko Fresh in his song \"Autopsie\", featured on the mixtape \"Airmax Muzik II\". Following that, Eko Fresh tweeted with irony to his fans, to buy Fler's album and called the song \"whack\".\n\nOn 11 March 2009, the artists of label Selfmade Records released \"Chronik 2\".

After that, both rappers were quiet for nearly a year. In 2011, Fler name-dropped Kollegah in his song \"Autopsie\".\n\nIn 2013, after the release of Kollegah and Farid Bang's collaboration album \"Jung, brutal, gutaussehend 2\", Fler released a track called \"Mut zur Hässlichkeit\" (), in which he made fun of their image and also imitates them.\n\n\n"}

He appeared on the classic 1988 Juice Crew posse cut \"The Symphony\". He is noted for his distinct voice and rapping proficiency, and has influenced several MCs.\nIn 2000, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but he did not reveal it to the public until 2013 , after first revealing his condition to his touring peers when his medicine syringes and vials were exposed after a police stop in the Czech Republic, as the group's belongings were searched and exposed.\nClear graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1988, after meeting Marley Marl in 1987 during his summer break. Ace made his recording debut on the Juice Crew posse-cut \"The Symphony\", along with fellow Juice Crew members Craig G, Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane, released on Marley Marl's \"In Control\" album. The album also featured two additional Ace tracks, \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\" and \"Simon Says\". In 1989, he released his first solo single, \"Together\" b/w \"Letter to the Better\". His debut album, \"Take a Look Around\", was released through Marl's Cold Chillin' label in 1990, featuring production from Marl and DJ Mister Cee. The album featured two minor hit singles in \"Music Man\" and \"Me & The Biz\", the latter track including Ace impersonating Biz Markie who did not reach the studio for the planned duet.\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Masta Ace was very energetic (cf. \"Jeep Ass Niguh\", where, tongue-in-cheek, he taunts police officers for their knee-jerk predisposition to harass black youth on city streets.) He also recorded material with a six-member supporting entourage, Masta Ace Incorporated. In light of his newly claimed status as a veteran, he has gravitated toward an earnest, matter-of-fact plainspokenness in the new millennium. Many of the songs that have lent newfound heft to his reputation are simple, no-nonsense rumination on feelings and facts of urban American life, including \"Soda and Soap\" and \"Beautiful\".\n\nDuring the years between his debut and his second album, Ace began having bitter feelings toward the commercial state of hip hop music, as well as the prominence of Gangsta rap, feelings which ruled the content on his second release, 1993's \"SlaughtaHouse\", with the loose concept of the album seeing Ace taking the fake \"gangsta emcees\" to his \"SlaughtaHouse\". The album featured Ace's new crew, Masta Ace Incorporated, which included Eyceurokk, Lord Digga, Paula Perry and R&B vocalist Leschea. The singles \"SlaughtaHouse\", \"Saturday Nite Live\", \"Style Wars\" and \"Jeep Ass Niguh\" were taken from the album. The latter featured an unlisted remix titled \"Born to Roll\", which became a crossover single in 1994, peaking at #23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. In the same year, Ace became a member of a temporary crew Crooklyn Dodgers, formed for the release of Spike Lee's movie, \"Crooklyn\", along with MC's Special Ed and Buckshot of Black Moon, and recorded the title track of the album soundtrack. The song became Ace's second Hot 100 hit in 1994, peaking at #60 on the chart.\n\nAce furthered his mainstream appeal in 1995, with his radio-friendly \"Sittin' on Chrome\" album. This effort was also released with the Masta Ace Incorporated crew, now also known as The I.N.C. The album was Ace's most commercially successful release, breaking into the Top 20 on \"Billboard\" 's Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. \"Sittin' On Chrome\" included \"Born to Roll\", as well as two other Hot 100 hit singles, \"The I.N.C. Ride\" and \"Sittin' on Chrome\". Following the album's success, Ace had a falling out with I.N.C. members Lord Digga and Paula Perry, leading to the breakup of the crew. After the split, Ace was largely missing from the hip hop scene over the next five years, save for a number of random vinyl singles. During his vinyl days, he bounced from a number of labels, releasing his \"Cars\" single on Tape Kingz Records, his \"Yeah Yeah Yeah\" and \"NFL\" singles on the Union Label, his \"NY Confidential\" single on Replay Records, his \"Express Delivery\" single on Three Sixty Records, his \"Spread It Out/Hellbound\" single on Yosumi Records, his \"Conflict\" single on Mona Records, his \"Ghetto Like\" single on Fat Beats, his \"So Now U A MC\" single on Bad Magic Records, and his \"Brooklyn Blocks\" single on Buckshot's Duck Down Records.\n\nAce's \"Ghetto Like\" single led to a misunderstanding with an underground emcee named Boogieman, who released a somewhat similar single titled \"Ghetto Love\" which was released on 420recordings not long before. He thought that Ace was \"biting\" his track and released a diss song toward Ace titled \"Just You Wait\". Ace responded to Boogieman on the diss track \"Acknowledge\", which also dissed The High & Mighty over a misunderstanding. The trading of records led to a rap battle between the two at a Lyricist Lounge event. \"Acknowledge\" was also included on \"\"Disposable Arts\".\" Masta Ace can also be found performing numerous \"Dubtitled\" voice overs on the television series titled \"Kung Faux\" seen in 150+ countries worldwide.\n\n\"Disposable Arts\" became one of the most acclaimed underground hip hop releases of 2001, beloved for its pure hip hop style and clever album concept, which served as a fictional story, chronicling Ace's time spent at a satirical rap school named the \"Institute of Disposable Arts\". JCOR Records folded soon after the release, leaving it out-of-print, until being re-released in 2005 on Ace's self-established M3 label. The album closer, \"No Regrets\", led many fans to believe that it would be Ace's final album, because of the line \"\"I don't know if it's the end, but yo, it might be\"\". Ace killed the rumors by returning in 2004 with his fifth album \"A Long Hot Summer\", another highly acclaimed effort. The story concept, similar to that on his last release, served as a prelude to the story told on \"Disposable Arts\", chronicling the \"Long Hot Summer\" that led to his character's incarceration at the beginning of the \"Disposable Arts\" album. Rumors once again spread about a retirement, which were again squashed, when Ace announced the formation of his new rap crew named eMC, including himself, Punchline, Wordsworth and his protégé Strick. Ace remarked in a December 2006 interview that he would no longer record as a solo artist, only with eMC. eMC's first group album, \"The Show\", was scheduled for early 2007 but was released in February 2008 digitally and April 2008 physically.\n\nIn 2007, Masta Ace had a track included on the \"Official Joints\" mixtape, a compilation of previously unreleased tracks by various NYC rappers.\n\nIn 2009, Masta Ace joined forces with Boston rapper Ed O.G. to release \"Arts & Entertainment\" which was released on November 3, 2009. \"Arts & Entertainment\" got shortened to A&E which resulted in the cable TV channel A&E asking Masta and Edo to remove the symbol from their original album artwork. The albums already printed have been sold at live shows following the release of the record.\n\nIn 2011 and in 2012 he coached high school football for the Irvington Blue Knights in NJ.\n\nIn 2012, Masta Ace released \"MA Doom: Son Of Yvonne\", produced entirely by MF Doom. He is also set to release a 10th anniversary release of Disposable Arts, featuring new recordings of songs from the album with a live band \nThe same site interviewed Masta Ace and he explained that Son of Yvonne helps him put across the things he didn't get to say to his mother before she died.\n\nIn January 2014, Masta Ace reunited with Stricklin, Wordsworth and Punchline as eMC, signing a record deal with Penalty Entertainment and Sony Red. They're expected to release an EP in April 2014, followed by a sophomore LP due out in early 2015. Punchline left the group in October 2014.\n\nLate 2014, it was announced that Masta Ace signed to M3 Records/Penalty Entertainment for his 6th solo album \"The Falling Season\" will drop in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, Masta Ace was interviewed by Ryan Maxwell for Hip-Hop Kings. The interview spoke in depth about the Disposable Arts re-issue, and the documentary which celebrated 20 years of the album. At the end of the interview, Masta Ace also confirmed he has begun filming another documentary for his critically acclaimed album \"A Long Hot Summer\".\n\nVia Twitter, Marco Polo announced a new Masta Ace album in January 2018, produced entirely by himself, which is titled \"A Brooklyn Story\" and scheduled for release on November 9, 2018.\n\nSeptember 11, 2018, a collaboration with DJ/Producer Tomo in der Muhlen was released, a remake of the infamous Goblin track \"Profondo Rosso\". The title of the rework is \"The Formula\".\n\nHe and Croatian producer Koolade made a song \"Beautiful\" that was on his album \"A Long Hot Summer\".\n\nHe is featured on a song off of album \"Protuotrov\" (antidote) by Bosnian rapper Frenkie, the song is called \"Živili\" (\"live on\") featuring Masta Ace & Phat Phillie and is produced by Edo Maajka.\n\nHe appeared on Czech hiphop group Prago Union's album \"HDP\", where he performed on the track \"Beat and I a já und ich\" along with German rapper Dendemann.\n\nHe also appeared on Polish rap group Familia H.P. album \"42\" on the track \"Born In New York\".\n\nIn 2003 he appeared on the Swedish rapper Chords' track \"Get u awn\" with Punchline. The track is on the album \"The garden around the mansion\".\n\nMasta Ace travelled to Australia in 2008 to record for the Funkoars track \"This is How\" which came off the album The Hangover. The track sampled parts of the Masta Ace's 2004 track \"Good Ol' Love\". The Funkoars have made several references to Masta Ace in their lyrics as well as using samples in other works.\n\nHe is also featured on the track \"Sminke\" by the critically acclaimed Norwegian Hip Hop duo Karpe Diem. The title of the album is Aldri Solgt En Løgn (Never Sold a Lie). In English the word \"Sminke\" means makeup, and the song is about artists trading their image for what their record companies want it to be.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared on \"Admit It\", a song by Swiss hip hop group \"Nefew\" from their album \"Off the Cuff\".\n\nIn 2010, he appeared on \"Set You Free\" along with Wordsworth, a track by UK hip hop DJ/Producer \"Skitz\" from his album \"The Sticksman\".\n\nIn 2010, he appeared on \"You don't know about it\" alongside M-Dot, a track by French hip hop DJ/Producer DJ Jean Maron from his album \"RUN MPC\". It was the lead single of the album and received heavy radio rotations. (released on 12\" and CD)\n\nIn 2012, he is featured on the track \"Progression\" by German DJ/Producer DJ Q-Fingaz from his album \"Qllection\". The same year, he is featured on \"The Bridge\", a song by Polish hip hop squad \"Slums Attack\" from album \"CNO 2\"\n\nIn 2014, he collaborated with Canberra-based Australian rapper Nix on the single \"SHE\".\n\nOn December 19, 2014, Ace was featured on a track called \"My Style\" with German Producer The Mighty Moe who also produced for Termanology, Reks and many more.\n\nIn 2014, he is featured alongside Tajai (from Souls Of Mischief) on the track \"2 the Essence\" by German Rapper Kool Savas from his album \"Märtyrer\"\n\nIn 2015, he appeared on \"Thinking of You\", a song by Swedish hip hop duo Professor P & DJ Akilles from their album \"All Year, Every Year\".\n\nIn 2015, he is featured alongside Kidaf & Nekfeu on the track \"Nothing Changed\" by German hip-hop/pop producer Shuko from his album \"For The Love Of It\".\n\nMasta Ace is considered to be a highly skilled and influential MC – music journalist Peter Shapiro describes him as “one of the great pure New York MCs”, and Allmusic describes him as “truly an underappreciated rap veteran and underground luminary”. Commenting on how Masta Ace is sometimes overlooked despite his skill, Rolling Stone says, “even the most avid fan of raw hip-hop lyricism can sometimes neglect to mention Masta Ace alongside hard-bitten champs such as Rakim, KRS-One, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick and Kool G Rap”. Eminem mentions Masta Ace as one of his influences in his book ‘The Way I Am’, saying, “Masta Ace had amazing storytelling skills – his thoughts were so vivid”.\n\n\n\n"}

The serial, about the struggle for power within a wealthy Mexican dynasty, was enormously popular in its native Mexico. It was also a hit in several foreign countries, including Brazil, the United States, Germany and Australia.\n\nDiana Bracho and Gonzalo Vega are the main characters, while María Rubio is the main antagonist in her role as Catalina Creel. Alejandro Camacho and Rebecca Jones are also antagonists.\n\nCatalina Creel (María Rubio), has an unconditional love for her son Alejando (Alejandro Camacho) and because of him, Catalina is willing to kill even her husband Carlos Larios (Raúl Meraz) and anyone who stands in his way, trying to hinder the destiny of the dynasty. Not so with Jose Carlos Larios (Gonzalo Vega), whom she blames deceptively for having burst an eye with a peg-top in his childhood, in revenge of his rejections, since Catalina was not his true mother. She invents this lie mainly to harass Jose Carlos and secondly to push her husband Carlos to get angry with Jose Carlos and disinherit him, so he turns his interest in expanding the dynasty only in his son Alejandro.\n\nCarlos discovers Catalina without the patch she uses to cover her crippled eye and decides to tell everyone about the deceivement, change his will in favor of Jose Carlos and divorce her. But before that, Catalina poisons him.\n\nVilma (Rebecca Jones), Alejandro's wife, is sterile and unable to give Alejandro a son, so she adds to Alejandro's plan to steal the son from a woman named Leonora (Diana Bracho), whom he cheated using the pretext that he was in love with her.\n\nLeonora starts a revenge against Catalina, Alejandro and Vilma through Jose Carlos, whom she takes advantage to enter the house, using the fact that he is in love with her, although in the end, she falls in love with him seriously.\n\nThe central character in \"Cuna de lobos\" is matriarch \"Catalina Creel\", played by actress María Rubio, a villain in the grand dramatic tradition of Dynasty's Alexis Carrington, Dallas' J. R. Ewing, or Knots Landing's Abby Cunningham.\n\nThe main character is Leonora, played by Diana Bracho, who portrays the victim of the \"wolves\", only to \"become\" a \"wolf\" herself to seek revenge.\n\nCatalina's unnatural devotion to her only son caused her to conceal a healthy eye behind the lie of blindness, commit a series of murders beginning with her own husband, Carlos (his crime was realizing how truly evil she was), and to participate in the abduction of a child to ensure her son's inheritance was confirmed.\n\nSuch is the impact of her performance, that soap opera's villain take her as a role model, and when a program parodies a soap opera, the main villain is usually based on her.\n\n\"Cuna de lobos\" was so popular in its native country that on the night of the final broadcast, the streets of Mexico City - infamously choked with traffic - were deserted as the locals were in their homes glued to their TV screens. It has been re-screened several times in the United States and Australia in recent years. A remake has been in talks for several years, with one finally surfacing in 2019.\n\nThe first DVD of \"Cuna de lobos\" came out in 2002. It was a single-disc DVD that contained the entire novela edited down to a little over 230 minutes. A second DVD release came on March 8, 2006. While it expanded the novela to over 11 hours played on three DVDs, the original instrumental music and soundtrack had been erased and substituted by new music. According to Televisa, this was due to a disagreement with Mexican actress and producer Carmen Salinas, who now owns the music rights after her deceased son Pedro Plascencia Salinas, producer of the music of the novela.\n\n"}
{"id": "2046284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046284", "title": "She's Too Young", "text": "She's Too Young\n\nShe's Too Young is an American made-for-TV movie released in 2004, starring Marcia Gay Harden as the mother of a 14-year-old daughter who is involved in sexual acts hidden from her parents. The film deals with the issues of drugs and alcohol, peer pressure, parenting an adolescent, the influence of the sexually-driven media, teen partying, and syphilis. The movie was shot in Halifax, Nova Scotia with the school scenes being shot at Halifax West High School. Though the film does not acknowledge this outwardly, the events of this film were partly inspired by a syphilis outbreak that occurred in a well-off suburb of Atlanta in 1996, where over 200 teenagers were exposed. The incident was chronicled in a \"Frontline\" episode called \"The Lost Children of Rockdale County\".\n\nThe film showcases three 14-year-old girls: Dawn (Miriam McDonald), Becca (Megan Park), and Hannah (Alexis Dziena). Hannah soon finds herself on the receiving end of peer pressure from her friends to engage in oral sex with Nick Hartman, a nice boy whom Hannah likes. She believes that she has to behave in a particular fashion in order to fit in with her more sexually-active peers.\n\nAs Hannah becomes more sexually \"advanced\", she does not reveal her sexual encounters and activities with Nick, to her mother, who is quite concerned about the subject. Hannah regards her mother's concern as being intrusive, knowing she would be shocked if she knew. When Hannah's best friend Dawn gets syphilis, the school nurses begin widespread testing. It soon becomes evident that the school is experiencing an epidemic.\n\nAlthough Nick is identified as the main spreader of the disease, he does not appreciate the serious nature of the issue and refuses to be tested, mocking those who undergo testing. Dawn reluctantly gets tested and discovers that she has contracted the disease. She realizes the consequences of her behavior and encourages her friends to get tested as well. Hannah notices a sore in her mouth one morning and decides to see the nurse, who tells Hannah that she is also infected. Thus, Hannah is forced to deal with the consequences of her actions.\n\nWhen Hannah's mother finds out about the syphilis spread, she launches an effort to alert parents about their children's dangerous behavior. Although she is certain that other parents will share her level of concern in helping their children, she is shocked by some of the parents' indifferent attitudes to their children's actions.\n\nMeanwhile, Becca is outraged when her religious parents (who do not know about her sexual history) decide to send her to boarding school, and Hannah is alienated at school because of her mother. She leaves her house one night and goes to her friend Tommy's house. They both realize they like each other and make out. Hannah wants to have sex, but Tommy refuses, explaining that he likes her but wishes to wait, as they are too young. Hannah becomes even more emotionally distraught, thinking he is not interested because she has been called a 'slut' and runs off. When Hannah's parents return home and see that she is gone, her mother goes off to find her. Walking around by herself in the street, Hannah calls Dawn and Becca. Dawn is grounded and is not allowed to speak with Hannah, and Becca is making out in a car with two boys and does not hear her phone.\n\nHannah goes to a party, where many of the kids from her school are present, looking for Becca. Brad, the party's host, directs Hannah to the basement, and when she realizes that Becca is not there, he attempts to have sex with her. She refuses, but he tries to force her into it. Tommy barges into the room, takes a picture of Brad and threatens to send it to 9-1-1. Brad leaves Hannah and ends the party.\n\nTommy takes Hannah back to his house and calls her parents. They come to fetch her, relieved to see she is alright. Hannah apologizes to them and her mother promises that things will be better from now on. The end of the film shows Becca has snuck back into her room and begins to cry. Dawn is playing Scrabble with her mother as her sister, Tess, who is not playing, sneaks off to Dawn's room. In there, she picks up one of Dawn's \"sexy\" shirts, takes off her glasses and models in front of the mirror, implying she may try to be 'like Dawn'.\n\nAt the end of the film, Alexis Dziena appears to give a public service announcement urging teens to wait to have sex because of both physical and emotional consequences.\n\n"}
{"id": "2046288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046288", "title": "William Bent", "text": "William Bent\n\nWilliam Wells Bent (May 23, 1809 – May 19, 1869) was a frontier trader and rancher in the American West, with forts in Colorado. He also acted as a mediator among the Cheyenne Nation, other Native American tribes and the expanding United States. With his brothers, Bent established a trade business along the Santa Fe Trail. In the early 1830s Bent built an adobe fort, called Bent's Fort, along the Arkansas River in present-day Colorado. Furs, horses and other goods were traded for food and other household goods by travelers along the Santa Fe trail, fur-trappers, and local Mexican and Native American people. Bent negotiated a peace among the many Plains tribes north and south of the Arkansas River, as well as between the Native American and the United States government.\n\nIn 1835 Bent married Owl Woman, the daughter of White Thunder, a Cheyenne chief and medicine man. Together they had four children. Bent was accepted into the Cheyenne tribe and became a sub-chief. In the 1840s, according to the Cheyenne custom for successful men, Bent took Owl Woman's sisters, Eagle woman and Island, as secondary wives. He had his fifth child with Eagle Woman. After Owl Woman died in 1847, Island cared for her children. Each of the sisters left Bent and, in 1869, he married the young Adaline Harvey, the educated mixed-race daughter of Alexander Harvey, a friend who was a prominent American fur trader in Kansas City. Bent died shortly after their marriage, and Adaline bore their daughter, his sixth child, after his death.\n\nWilliam Wells Bent was born May 23, 1809 St. Louis, Missouri, a son of Silas Bent and his wife. His father was later appointed as a justice of the Missouri Supreme Court. William was one of the Bents' eleven children. The first three were born in Charleston, Virginia, present-day West Virginia and the remaining children were born in St. Louis after the family migrated there.\n\nThree of William's brothers, George, Charles, and Robert, partnered with him in trading with Native Americans in the West. Charles was the oldest son, born in 1799, and the remaining brothers were born in or after 1806. Later based in Santa Fe, Charles Bent lived in Taos. He served briefly as the first territorial governor of New Mexico.\n\nCharles, George, Robert, and William Bent partnered in the fur trade with Ceran St. Vrain, also a St. Louis native. The city had several major fur trading families. They left Missouri about 1826 to explore what is now southern Colorado along the upper Arkansas River to trap for furs and establish a trade business. Within a couple of years, the Bents and St. Vrain had built two stockades, one near the present town of Pueblo, Colorado and the other stockade either at the mouth of the Purgatoire River, on the northern side of the Arkansas River. The historian Grinnell suggested that William Bent was likely trapping furs before the first stockade was built. St. Vrain and his older brother, Charles, made the round trips to St. Louis, a regional trading center, to sell furs and return with supplies.\n\nTo set up their trading venture, the brothers used a legacy of their father, Judge Silas Bent. The brothers reinvested the substantial profits of their enterprise to develop their business.\n\nBy around 1832, although possibly as late as 1834, the partners built a permanent trading post called Bent's Fort. The elaborate adobe construction could accommodate 200 people, and had been built on the northern \"Mountain Route\" of the Santa Fe Trail, by then open for business. The partners picked this location after discussions with the Cheyenne; it was near La Junta and land occupied by the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. It became an important center of trade, principally in furs but also in numerous other goods, including horses and mules. It was the only privately owned, fortified installation in the west.\n\nWilliam and Charles operated the fort in partnership with Ceran St Vrain, a fur trader who had already established significant trading contacts in New Mexico. Sometimes referred to as Fort William, the post was in \"the perfect place at the perfect time\" for someone looking to make money from trading. For example, the Bents could buy a gallon of brandy in St Louis for 2 and sell it at the fort for 25.\n\nThe historian Anne Hyde has dated the moment when the Cheyenne chief White Thunder realized a common interest with Bent. In November 1833, they talked together as a meteor shower lit up the sky over the plains. Many Cheyenne believed that the celestial event was a signal of the end of the world; it was subsequently referred to as \"the Night the Stars Fell\". White Thunder saw it as a new beginning. He sought a truce with the Pawnee and the return of the four sacred arrows which they had captured in a battle with the Cheyenne earlier that year. To achieve this, White Thunder made a solo, unarmed visit to the Pawnee village to seek peace and returned with two of the arrows and an agreement.\n\nWhite Thunder also arranged a formal marital alliance between Bent and his daughter Owl Woman. He believed that their children would represent another element of the new beginning, of peace for the Cheyenne and the region. By this time Bent had learned the language of the Cheyenne, and he was known as \"Little White Man\" by the native tribes. When the Bents first met with the Cheyenne, the Indians gave them names in the Cheyenne language. The Bent brothers' respect for the Cheyenne protocols during the convivial occasion created a relationship base for their future development of the fort and trading.\n\nThe fort, and the area immediately outside it, comprised a multi-cultural, multi-lingual center with permanent inhabitants from many nations and visitors. Native tribes in the area for trading, such as the Sioux, Apache and Kiowa, as well as Comanche and Cheyenne also established temporary camps outside the fort. It was the hub of a trading area that encompassed a 500-mile radius. It was also a stop each year for hundreds of wagons of European Americans traveling the Santa Fe trail. Hyde writes in \"Empires, Nations and Families\" that \n\nBent's Fort was the one spot on the Santa Fe trail where exchanges with Indians were welcomed and encouraged, and the effects of those conversations on both sides were far-reaching  ...  archaeological evidence tells us that people sat in the courtyard together and smoked—a lot\".Bent managed trade to and from the fort: he provided a safe zone in the area and a supply of goods for its store, as well as shipping buffalo robes back to St. Louis for sale. As many as 20,000 Native Americans camped near the fort in the fall for seasonal trading.\n\nEuropean-American travelers sometimes stayed for as long as three weeks at the fort before resuming their journeys. From fall through spring, the fort was busy with people coming to trade, and travelers resting and restocking supplies. The Bents had up to 100 employees, depending on the season, who had a variety of skills: clerks, guards, traders, teamsters, trappers, a tailor, blacksmith, carpenter and herders. Caravans took goods to trade with regional Native American tribes.\n\nThe fort was usually relatively empty during the summer months. During that period, Bent often made the six-month round trip on the trail to and from Westport, Missouri (present-day Kansas City) to trade the furs and goods gathered over the previous winter. He would purchase goods to replenish the stocks of the fort for the forthcoming hunting season. Westport Landing was an ideal terminus for the Bents' trade. Located on the Missouri River, it was a port for steamboats that hauled goods eastward to St. Louis. Sometimes five or six steamboats would be unloading goods for the Santa Fe trade at one time; dried buffalo meat, buffalo robes and furs would be loaded onto the boats for the return east. Westport was a boom town until a cholera epidemic in the mid-1840s reduced the town's population by 50%. In 1853 Westport was renamed Kansas City. While Bent and the pack trains were away, the fort managed with a skeleton crew of herders, clerks, traders and laborers for Native Americans and travelers.\n\nWilliam and Charles Bent had brought three slaves from St. Louis to work in their households: the brothers Andrew and Dick Green, and Dick's wife Charlotte, who served as a cook. In 1848 Charlotte Green described herself to George Ruxton as \"de only lady in de whole damn Injun country\". Her cooking won her a high reputation among the fur traders and travelers. One person called her a \"culinary divinity\". Bent's Fort held dances regularly; Colonel Henry Inman described Charlotte as \"the center of attention, the belle of the evening. She knew her worth and danced accordingly.\"\n\nIn 1846 Bent was given the title of \"Colonel\" by the United States (US) Army after supplying US troops and guiding them into New Mexico during the Mexican–American War. George and William Bent freed Dick Green for his heroic efforts in an Indian revolt in 1847 at Taos, during which their brother Charles was killed. Green had gone north with American soldiers to defend Bent's Taos home. He bravely led a skirmish against a group of Taos Pueblo and other warriors. Green was severely wounded but survived a trip back to Bent's Fort. Also allowing Charlotte Green to leave with her husband, the Bents gave her an informal freedom.\n\nAs the demand for furs declined, business dropped at the fort. An 1849 cholera epidemic among the Cheyenne took the lives of half the tribe, including Tall Woman, Bent's mother-in-law.\n\nBent wanted to build a new fort closer to Big Timbers, near the winter grounds for many tribes. Unable to agree on a selling price for the old fort, after removing his inventory of goods, Bent blew up and set fire to the old fort. In 1853 he established a stone fort in the Big Timbers area. Six years later, the US government purchased the new \"Bent's Fort\", renamed it Fort Wise and remodeled it for military use.\n\nBent, Vrain & Company had other forts, including\n\nOn April 6, 1858 Bent purchased a farm with a small brick house at 1032 West 55th Street in Kansas City, Missouri. While generally living at his home in Missouri in 1859, Bent was an agent to the Cheyenne and Arapaho at Big Timbers. At that time, Bent continued his trading business for new settlers lured by the Colorado gold rush. He also freighted goods for the United States government, which yielded a good profit.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Bent's farm was the site of the Battle of Westport in 1864. In 1871, two years after Bent's death, Adaline sold the Westport farm to Seth Ward, a prosperous businessman.\n\nIn 1835 Bent married Owl Woman (\"Mis-stan-stur\"), the oldest daughter of White Thunder and Tail Woman, in a Cheyenne ceremony. Her father was an influential Cheyenne leader and medicine man. He was the tribe's \"Keeper of the Arrows,\" four arrows thought to have a sacred or medicinal role. The prestige of his position as a medicine man meant that his daughters also had high status.\n\nOwl Woman\nAs a part of the marriage ritual, Owl Woman was carried into a lodge which was constructed for them in the Cheyenne village near the fort, while Bent dispensed numerous gifts to her people. Bent later became a \"Cheyenne sub-chief\", as he was given tribal membership with his marriage to Owl Woman.\n\nThe marriage was important for both Bent and Owl Woman's father White Thunder. For Bent, the marriage reinforced his relationship with the Cheyenne. White Thunder believed the marriage would strengthen his alliance with Bent and provide protection for the Cheyenne. On a personal level, it enhanced his prestige within the tribe.\n\nOwl Woman and Bent had the following children, named in English and Cheyenne:\n\nAs a successful man, Bent followed Cheyenne custom and by 1844 took Owl Woman's two younger sisters, Yellow Woman and Island, as secondary wives. He had another son with Yellow Woman:\n\nOwl Woman died in 1847 or later. In the following six years, life for the family changed dramatically. In 1849 a cholera epidemic swept through the Cheyenne tribe, killing up to half of the people, including the children's maternal grandmother, Tail Woman. After this, Bent destroyed his old fort and built a new stone one at Big Timbers.\n\nIsland became the primary caregiver for Owl Woman's children. She did not want to stay in the Bents' new stone fort, nor did she want the children there. In February 1854, she had her lodge moved to just outside the new fort. That winter, William's oldest son George Bent, then age 11, was sent to Kansas City to attend an Episcopal boarding school. In the following years, he was separated from his family for much of the time in order to attend school. Island later left Bent for Joe Baraldo.\n\nIn 1864 Yellow Woman also left Bent. She left with their son Charley Bent, then 19, who joined the Dog Soldiers. This group of warriors formed to retaliate for the Sand Creek Massacre that year, when US forces attacked and killed numerous Cheyenne.\n\nAdaline Harvey\nAfter Yellow Woman and Island had both left him, Bent married Adaline Harvey, the 20-year-old mixed-race daughter of his friend Alexander Harvey, a fur trader based in Kansas City and a Blackfeet mother. He was then 60 years old. They married on April 4, 1869 in Jackson County, Missouri. Harvey traded in the Upper Missouri region; his company was named Harvey, Primeau & Company.\n\nWhen the son George Bent met his father's new wife, he recognized Adaline Harvey as having been a student at his school; she was five years younger than he. They had both been assigned Robert Campbell as a guardian while at the boarding school.\n\nThe marriage was short, as William died later that year. Pregnant at his death, Adaline Harvey Bent was reported to have had a daughter. Adaline Bent inherited her husband's property in Kansas City in 1869 and sold it in 1871.\n\nLife at the fort, called the \"mud castle of the plains\", reflected the heritage of both Owl Woman and Bent. The children's clothes included linen shirts and soft-leather moccasins. They ate on fine china and, according to Cheyenne custom, slept on the ground in soft hides. The furnishings and household goods included items from the United States, Mexico and overseas nations. The children enjoyed pumpkin pie and pancakes made by Charlotte Green, an enslaved cook whose husband was also held by the Bents. Chipita, the French-Mexican wife of a Bent worker, made taffy for the children. She performed housekeeping and laundry services at the fort.\n\nOwl Woman's mother Tall Woman taught the children to be respectful and courteous to their elders. They gave discipline by stern glances and waving fingers. In their multi-cultural environment, the children learned to speak many languages; George learned to speak Cheyenne, English, Spanish, Comanche, Kiowa and Arapaho. The boys learned to ride horses bareback, to hunt and to be warriors. The girls learned to assist in the household, assessing the dryness of wood for gathering, learning to recognize the varieties of berries and other plants, and their uses. Girls were taught to be gracious, generous hosts. Later George Bent recalled of his childhood at the fort:\n\nWilliam and his wife Owl Woman had several homes. Where they lived depended on the season, which affected both his travels and the Cheyenne's seasonal movements.\n\nIn the 1820s, the central plains area was subject to political and economic turmoil resulting from the Mexican War of Independence. The Arkansas River delineated the border, with Mexico to the south and the United States northward. The people looked for new opportunities for trade alliances, in part to replace those that had involved the now-deposed Spanish governors. United States settlers and military forces began to arrive in the area as people were exploring the west.\n\nThe Native American tribes of the central and southern plains were also defining or redefining their territories. Tribes moved to new lands within the plains for various reasons: they may have been displaced in their previous land, had internal disputes that caused them to relocate, sought better hunting or gathering grounds, or sought land that supported their way of life. The Comanche, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Arapaho were among the competing tribes. The Cheyenne likely moved into the plains in the 17th and 18th century from Minnesota. By the mid-1800s, they lived with the Arapaho north of the Arkansas River near the site later developed as Bent's Fort in Colorado.\n\nThe Comanche came to the grasslands of southern plains for a better life but competed for resources and territory with other tribes. In an agreement reached with the Cheyenne, \"The Great Peace of 1840\", they agreed to stay south of the Arkansas River and the Cheyenne and Arapaho north of it.\n\nThe long-settled and the recently settled tribes had different views of the traders, which exacerbated inter-tribal rivalries. In 1833 White Thunder led the Cheyenne into a fight with the Pawnee; his people lost many warriors, and the Pawnee captured the four sacred arrows. White Thunder and his tribe lost much respect as a result.\n\nDuring the mid-1830s, the Cheyenne and the Arapaho had become eager to work with the incoming trade caravans, and notably those associated with Bent. They saw the trade caravans as an opportunity for enrichment rather than as a threat. The Cheyenne favored Bent because he had intervened to protect them against Comanche raiders.\n\nBent worked to negotiate a resolution to the inter-tribal disputes, and to end their raids on settlers and traders. While the truce was uneasy, it enhanced his position. The historian Anne Hyde described the situation as similar to that in northern California, as a \"negotiated community. ... Only constant renegotiation and the conscious creation of community through family ties, diplomacy, warfare, and dinner made it operate in a surprisingly stable way.\"\n\nIn contrast, the Comanche had resisted traders and other incursions. They had for many years protected their territory to the south of the Arkansas River against almost all who attempted to move into it. They had built up their power with a deep knowledge of their territory, shrewd trading arrangements, and their willingness to raid those who threatened or breached the arrangements. Their grip on the territory to the south of the river was one of the reasons why Bent's Fort had been constructed to the north. Although the Comanche continued to assert their power after Mexican independence, the influx of displaced tribes, the westward push of European-American settlers, and the development of the Santa Fe Trail generated new conflicts. Raids and battles resulted in many fatalities. The Comanche raided the fort and its surroundings north of the river in 1839, provoking a retaliatory raid by the Cheyenne.\n\nThe trading environment improved after 1840, when Bent's Fort became the site of a truce between the Comanche, Apache and Kiowa tribes of the north and the Cheyenne and Arapaho of the south. Hyde describes this as a \"network of enormous significance.\" The tribes negotiated a peace over several weeks during the summer of 1840.\n\nBent hosted the various camps and their celebrations. Hyde has said that\n\nGeorge Ruxton described in 1848 how the council room at the fort was used: \"Chiefs of the Shain [sic], Kioway and Araphó sit in solemn conclave with the head traders, and smoke the \"calumet\" over their real and imaginary grievances.\"\n\nBlack Kettle, chief of the Southern Cheyenne, wanted peace with the United States. He and other chiefs signed a treaty in 1861 which resulted in his tribes being assigned to a reservation along Sand Creek, although the area was nearly devoid of game. White settlers continued to trespass upon Cheyenne land. Unable to feed their families, some Cheyenne begged for food from settlers; others returned to old hunting grounds. Still others raided settlers and wagon trains for food.\n\nThe Pike's Peak gold rush of 1858 led to increasing conflicts. American miners and settlers gradually encroached on Cheyenne lands until fighting broke out in 1864. Black Kettle asked Bent to persuade the Americans to negotiate peace and, briefly, it appeared possible. But, Governor John Evans and Colonel John Chivington (who was planning a run for U.S. Congress) had based their political futures on ending the Native American threat. They had amassed troops from Washington, D.C. When Bent, who had lived among the Cheyenne for 40 years and had half-Cheyenne children, asked for peaceful resolution, Chivington told him it was not possible.\n\nDespite an apparent peace agreement, on November 28, 1864, Chivington and a volunteer army captured Bent's son Robert. They forced him to guide the soldiers to the Cheyenne campsite on the reservation. The US forces killed and mutilated between 200 and 400 Cheyenne in the Sand Creek Massacre. Charles, Julie and George Bent were all inside Black Kettle's village when Chivington and his forces arrived.\n\nGeorge Bent recalled that day:\n\nRobert Bent said:\n\nAll of Bent's grown children survived the massacre. Robert Bent testified in court against Chivington, who had forced him to guide the soldiers to the Cheyenne village. His brothers Charles and George Bent joined the Dog Soldiers band, as did Yellow Woman, who left William Bent to go with her son Charles. The Dog Soldiers led continuing resistance to drive the European Americans from the Cheyenne homeland. Charles Bent was later killed by scouts for the U.S. Army.\n\nRegular Army officers were horrified by the massacre at Sand Creek. Both the Congress and Army investigated, and General Ulysses S. Grant called Chivington's actions murder, but no one was punished. The Committee on the Conduct of the War reported:\n\nMost of the Dog Soldiers band was killed by US forces in June 1869 in the Battle of Summit Springs.\n\nGeorge Bent survived and married Magpie, a Cheyenne woman, and had a family. Bilingual, he served as an interpreter beginning in 1865. He moved to the Cheyenne and Arapaho reservation in 1870, where he lived the rest of his life, and worked for the US Indian agent as an interpreter and assistant. In the early twentieth century, he served as a major source or informant for James Mooney and George Bird Grinnell, anthropologists who went to the West to study the Cheyenne and learn about their history and culture. Based on his letters to George E. Hyde, Hyde wrote his biography, which was not published until 1968.\n\nOn October 14, 1865, the Arapaho and Cheyenne of the Upper Arkansas valley made a treaty with the US government. US representatives included Bent and Kit Carson, who was Special Commissioner. The US apologized to the Arapaho and Cheyenne for the Sand Creek Massacre. Some of the tribe members did not approve of the treaty, which would limit them to a reservation south of the Arkansas River, rather than their traditional territory to the north, which was larger.\n\nAs part of the treaty, four of Bent's children, as Cheyenne, were each awarded 640 acres land on a reservation south of the Arkansas River, between Red Creek and Buffalo Creek:\n\nRobert Bent was awarded 640 acres in Sulphur Springs, north of the Arkansas River.\n\nWilliam Bent assisted in the negotiation of the treaty with the Kiowa and Comanche on October 18, 1865.\n\nIn 1869, following his marriage to Adaline Harvey, Bent moved with her to his ranch in Las Animas, Colorado on the Purgatoire River, south of the Arkansas River. (Note: Source above for the year is the 1869 marriage record, from official records.) From there he managed his freighting business.\n\nWhile on a supply trip from Colorado to Missouri in 1869, Bent stopped off to see his daughter Mary and son-in-law, R. M. Moore, a judge. They had built a house on his ranch land in Kansas City. Contracting pneumonia, Bent died on May 19, 1869. He is interred at the Las Animas Cemetery south of Las Animas, Colorado.\n\nAdaline Harvey Bent gave birth to their daughter, after his death. She lived most of her life in Colorado, where she died February 26, 1905 at the Pueblo Women's Hospital.\n\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\n"}

Active in the aftermath of the 1970 Black Power Revolution, the group fought a guerrilla campaign to overthrow the government of Prime Minister Eric Williams after the failed Black Power uprising.\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 NUFF attacked police posts to acquire weapons, robbed banks, and carried out an insurgent campaign against the government. With improved intelligence capabilities, the government was able to track the group and eventually killed or captured most of its leadership. Eighteen NUFF members and three policemen were killed over the course of the insurgency.\n\nNUFF was anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist in its ideology, and opposed both the foreign investors who controlled much of the economy and the local economic elites. They were notable for the extent to which women played an active role in the organisation, and included women among its guerrilla fighters.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago became independent in 1962 under the leadership of Eric Williams and the People's National Movement, but independence left much of the economy in the hands of foreign interests and was \"a postponement of social, political and economic equality\" for many of the working class Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians who formed the base of support for Williams and the PNM.\n\nIn 1969, West Indian students at Sir George Williams University in Montreal staged a sit-in at the university's computer centre to protest discriminatory grading practices. The resulting arrests and trial of a group of students was a catalyst in the formation of the National Joint Action Committee at the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago. NJAC activists moved out of the university and worked to educate and mobilise the population, especially unemployed youth in Port of Spain and San Fernando. In February 1970 Black Power demonstrations broke out in the major urban centres in Trinidad and Tobago. Over the course of March and April these demonstrations gained support, especially after Basil Davis, a young NJAC activist, was killed by the police. On 21 April, the government declared a state of emergency and arrested the leaders of the protest movement. This triggered a mutiny by the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment. After 10 days of negotiations with the government, the mutineers surrendered, and the government reasserted control.\n\nPrior to the uprising in 1970, a loose grouping known as the Western United Liberation Front (WOLF) had formed in the western Port of Spain suburb of St. James. The group, which consisted of largely unemployed young men, also included active members of the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment. According to one of the surviving members of the organisation, Malcolm \"Jai\" Kernahan, there was coordination between members of WOLF and Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, the leaders of the army mutiny, and that when the mutiny occurred Brian Jeffers and other members of WOLF \"took up arms\" and headed into the hills about Port of Spain to connect with the mutineers. When the mutineers surrendered, Jeffers, the de facto leader of WOLF, decided to continue with the goal of overthrowing the government through armed rebellion.\n\nIn 1971, the as-yet unnamed revolutionary organisation shot Theodore Guerrra, the chief prosecutor in the court martial of the mutineers. Shortly after, Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard commander David Bloom was shot. Bloom had played an important role in the suppression of the mutiny. Both men survived the shootings. The shootings gave the militants credibility among NJAC members who were disenchanted with the state of the \"virtual collapse\" of the organisation after the arrest of its leadership. Guy Harewood, an NJAC activist from Woodbrook, joined the group, as did other NJAC activists from the Port of Spain area. These activists were able to expand the reach of the group by making connections with other disaffected NJAC members.\n\nIn late 1971 Jai Kernahan left the group in St. James and returned to his hometown of Fyzabad. In the oilfields of south Trinidad, with its history of militant trade unionism, Kernahan found people receptive to the idea of engaging in guerrilla insurgency. He gathered a group of activists and established a training camp in the forest. \n\nOn 31 May 1972 Kernahan's group, newly named the National Union of Freedom Fighters, attacked an Estate Police Station belonging to the American oil company Texaco, and seized six guns and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. The following day, armed NUFF members in north Trinidad robbed the Barclays Bank branch at the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies. The rough, forested terrain of the Northern Range provided safety for NUFF's roughly three dozen guerrilla fighters. Fidel Castro compared the landscape to that of Cuba's Sierra Maestra, from which Castro had launched the Cuban Revolution.\n\nOn 1 July, a group of guerrillas returning from the Northern Range were intercepted at a police roadblock and a gunfight occurred. One NUFF member, Hillary Valentine, was killed and three policemen were shot. Valentine's funeral attracted four thousand mourners. On 23 February 1973 Barclay's Bank on Tragarete Road in Port of Spain was robbed. Acting on a tip, the police ambushed a group of NUFF members at a safe house in Laventille later than day. Three NUFF members were killed including John Beddoe. Jamaican sociologist Brian Meeks considered Beddoe's death to be \"a major blow to the movement as he is one of the people with genuine organizational capability and the leading advocate of the line for greater propaganda, education and consolidation\".\n\nOn 1 June NUFF guerrillas used gelignite to destroy a transformer at the Textel Earth Station, the satellite link connecting Trinidad and Tobago with the outside world and left a message for Assistant Superintendent of Police Randolph Burroughs \"that if he wanted [them] to come in the bush for [them]\". The guerrillas ambushed policemen responding to the incident and injured four of them. On 6 August, the Trinidad-Tesoro Oil Company's police station in south Trinidad was attacked, and three days later the Matelot Police Station was attacked. The insurgents left Matelot with twice as many guns as there were people to carry those guns. These attacks prompted a joint operation by the army and police against the rebels, and the government offered large rewards for Jeffers, Harewood and Andrea Jacob, a third member of the group's leadership.\n\nThe possibility of rewards, coupled with the use of harder interrogation techniques, allowed the police to ambush the northern group at their camp in Valencia on 28 August. Although the guerillas all escaped with only minor injuries, the attack showed the benefits of the shift in tactics by the police. On 13 September, two hundred police and soldiers surprised the guerrillas in Caura, where they had retreated after the attack in Valencia. A sentry at the camp was killed and Jennifer Jones was captured. As they fled the attack on the camp, two insurgents Beverly Jones (sister of Jennifer Jones and British Black Panther leader Altheia Jones-LeCointe) and Kenneth Tenia, were killed by the police. After this, NUFF was left on the defensive: \"police were on our heels, people were selling us out and we just running from ambush to ambush\" recounted NUFF member Terrance Thornhill, in a 1996 interview with Meeks.\n\nAfter Guy Harewood was killed by the police in Curepe on 17 October 1973 NUFF was \"effectively broken\". Their last major activist, Clem Haynes, was captured by the police in Laventille in November 1974, marking the end of the movement. Overall, 18 NUFF members and three policeman were killed over the course of the insurgency.\n\nNUFF was only the second group in the modern English-speaking Caribbean to attempt a serious guerrilla uprising, and the only group that was able to create an insurgent campaign that was sustained over time. Their decision to engage in armed struggle resulted not only in the destruction of the organisation, but also prompted the government of Trinidad and Tobago to react more harshly to the non-violent organisations like NJAC and the leadership of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union and the Transport and Industrial Workers Union.\n\nAccording to historian and former Black Power activist Brinsley Samaroo, Eric Williams, who remained Prime Minister until his death in 1981, was \"decidedly harsh\" in his assessment of NUFF in his final, unpublished book:\nMany surviving members of NUFF received lengthy prison sentences. Clem Haynes was imprisoned for eight years. Andy Thomas (later Abdullah Omowale) and Kirkland Paul (Kirklon Paul according to some sources) were sentenced to death for the murder of Police Constable Austin Sankar in 1975 and remained on death row until 1987 when they were pardoned by President Noor Hassanali.\n\nNUFF's ideology was anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist and \"seemingly anti-sexist\". They opposed both foreign investors and the local economic elites, and strove the overthrow the Williams administration through violence. NUFF was a product of the Black Power movement, but its members believed that that movement had failed to achieve its objectives. David Millette, and attorney who \"grew up around members of NUFF\" and researched the movement considered the main point of disagreement between NUFF and NJAC was NUFF's belief that NJAC had lost its effectiveness and was \"only talking\". Meeks, similarly, says that NUFF attracted people who were unhappy with NJAC's ineffectiveness after the arrest of its leadership and its transition to a cultural nationalist ideology. NUFF, he says, attracted people who were drawn to the \"armed revolution was the only solution\" slogan which had become popular in 1970.\n\nPolitical scientist Perry Mars described NUFF's ideology as Maoist, and spoke of their \"violent and suicidal extremism\". Victoria Pasley described them as \"Marxist-socialist\", and that they differed from NJAC in seeing class, not race, as the dominant problem in society. Pasley also mentions the role that women played in the organisation, most notably Beverly Jones who was killed by the police in Caura. Women in NUFF fought on equal terms with men and were seen as having equal standing in the movement. Meeks describes the movement as \"extreme foquista\" in their revolutionary ideology, embracing the foco theory of revolution of Régis Debray and Che Guevara.\n\nPolitical scientists have drawn connections NUFF's insurgency and the 1990 coup d'état attempt by the Jamaat al Muslimeen. Their use of violence as a tactic to challenge the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy was seen by political scientist John La Guerre as an inspiration for the Jamaat al Muslimeen. The movements also shared a connection in the person of Abdullah Omowale (formerly Andy Thomas), who was a leading figure in both the 1990 coup attempt and in NUFF's insurgency. Jennifer Jones-Kernahan (formerly Jennifer Jones) went on to serve as a United National Congress senator, government minister and ambassador to Cuba, while her husband, Jai Kernahan contested the Laventille West constituency for the People's Partnership in the 2015 Trinidad and Tobago general election.\n"}

The first three tracks of the album represent the \"Inferno\" (Watt's illness up until the time the abscess burst); the second three songs represent the \"Purgatorio\" (Watt's surgery and subsequent recovery), and the final three represent the \"Paradisio\" (Watt's resuming his everyday life and career).\n\nFor the music of \"...Middle Stand\", Watt chose to do something he had been planning to do before the illness struck - work with a keyboardist instead of a guitarist, as he had done for his entire musical career. To play organ, he enlisted Pete Mazich, who he had played with locally in an infrequent side project, The Madonnabees, which was devoted to reinterpreting the songs of Madonna. For the drum seat, Watt tapped Jerry Trebotic, who had previously toured with Watt in his project band The Jom And Terry Show and played with both Watt and Mazich in The Madonnabes. Both musicians, like Watt, are natives of San Pedro, California, making the group the first all-Pedro band Watt had since the breakup of The Minutemen in 1985. Watt dubbed this new band The Secondmen. The Secondmen did three tours before ever recording a note of the album in the studio. For their first tour in the spring of 2002, the shows opened with the \"Inferno\" section of the piece. The following tour a year later added the first two songs of the \"Purgatorio\" section. A third tour later in 2003 mixed opening dates with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in between headlining club dates. \n\nPrior to recording the album and a day before his 46th birthday, Watt had a bicycle accident which injured his left arm (fortunately, without any broken bones or other damage), forcing him to postpone the start of the recording sessions until January 16, 2004. For the first time in his career, Watt recorded in his home town of San Pedro, California at Karma Studio with veteran recording engineer Michael Rich, and recorded for the first time using a full digital audio system (Pro Tools) rather than analog tape. \n\nWatt augmented the basic sound of the Secondmen in the studio with tympani and other percussion borrowed from Stephen Perkins (Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Banyan), backing vocals by alt-rock chanteuse Petra Haden, and an extensive array of effect pedals that Watt played his bass through in order to help convey some of the emotions and ideas behind the album.\n\nNo singles were released from the album, but a video for \"Tied A Reed 'Round My Waist\" was filmed in San Pedro by veteran video director Lance Bangs. In the winter of 2005, another Pedro native, director Mike Muscarella, filmed a trilogy of videos involving the original Secondmen lineup (Trebotic had to forego touring with the band because of family-related constraints, replaced on the road by Raul Morales) plus Ms. Haden, for the songs \"Burstedman\", \"Beltsandedman\", and \"Pelicanman\". All three of the videos in this trilogy, plus the video for \"Tied A Reed 'Round My Waist\", can be streamed at Mr. Muscarella's site, http://www.mikestheater.com.

It was founded by Ellis Laurimore Phillips, an engineer, and a group of New York City investors, including George W. Olmsted, when they purchased four small electric companies in Amityville, Islip, Northport and Sayville.\n\nLILCO was long notorious for its high rates. Indeed, according to a 1999 article in \"The New York Times,\" LILCO's rates were considered part of an \"unholy trinity of life on Long Island,\" along with the Long Island Rail Road's service woes and traffic snarls on the Long Island Expressway.\n\nHurricane Gloria hit Long Island on September 27, 1985, but power was not fully restored until October 8. The utility's poor response to the storm further eroded public confidence in LILCO's ability to handle an emergency and placed increased pressure to shutter the LILCO built Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant. Two years earlier, the Suffolk County legislature resolved that the county could not be safely evacuated in the event of an emergency. In an effort to show they were prepared for the event of a nuclear mishap at Shoreham, LILCO created a volunteer organization, staffed by Shoreham engineers and various staff from LILCO itself, named LERO (Local Emergency Response Organization) to provide assistance to the public. In the end, in a political decision born from LILCO's inability to present a viable evacuation plan for Suffolk County, Shoreham was closed down in 1992 after never having operated at more than minimum power for testing purposes. LILCO's assets were then bought by the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), a public authority.\n\nOn March 5, 1998, final Federal approval was received for LIPA to take over LILCO's electrical transmission network. The deal was completed later that year. The rest of LILCO, including its electrical distribution and natural gas businesses, merged with Brooklyn Union Gas to form KeySpan, which continued to run LILCO's old transmission network under contract with LIPA. KeySpan was taken over by National Grid USA in 2007. National Grid handed control of Long Island's electrical transmission system to New Jersey utility Public Service Enterprise Group in 2014.\n\n"}

Clarke and Stephen Baxter. It is the first book in the A Time Odyssey series. The next book in the series is \"Sunstorm\".\n\nThe story begins with a series of individuals from different time periods encountering motionless, hovering spheres—and each other—in the region of the Northwest Frontier. Two early hominins, a mother and daughter, are the first. They lack a language, but are referred to in the narration as \"Seeker\" and \"Grasper\". Just after encountering a sphere, they are captured by strange creatures in red, later revealed to be British Redcoats.\n\nIn the year 2037, a UN peacekeeper helicopter is badly damaged by an RPG. It crashes near Jamrud Fort, which is manned by British soldiers and sepoys from 1885—including the same redcoats who captured Seeker and Grasper, which the British call \"man-apes\". Also present at the fort are the factor Cecil de Morgan, and two journalist observers, the American Josh White and the Anglo-Indian \"Ruddy\"—a young and as-yet unknown Rudyard Kipling.\n\nThe helicopter crew comprises an American pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Casey Othic; a British Indian observer, Lieutenant Bisesa Dutt; and Chief Warrant Officer Abdikadir Omar, an Afghan Pashtun with blue eyes and strawberry blond hair, which he claims is inherited from soldiers in the army of Alexander the Great. All three survive the helicopter crash, and they are taken prisoner by the British. Both sides soon realise that they are from different time periods, brought together by an event they name the \"Discontinuity\", and begin working together.\n\nAbdikadir investigates one of the spheres, located near the fort, which the British call an \"Eye\". He determines that it possesses inexplicable properties; among other things, its circumference and volume are not related to its radius by a factor of pi, as in ordinary geometry, but by a factor of exactly 3. The 19th-century British, however, have become accustomed to the sphere, and use a camouflage net draped over it as a cage for the \"man-apes\".\n\nAlso beginning in 2037, a Soyuz capsule departs the International Space Station to return to Earth. Aboard are two Russians, Musa Ivanov and Kolya Krivalapov, and an American, Sable Jones. Sable is abrasive and ambitious, which Kolya believes has helped her succeed in her field, but she especially irritates Musa. The Soyuz loses contact with ground control, and takes up orbit rather than re-entering the atmosphere. They manage to establish radio contact with the \"moderns\" in Jamrud, and through the cosmonauts' observations, the characters learn that the Earth has become a patchwork conglomerate of terrain, and people, from different time periods spanning two million years ago up to the 21st century. Aside from Jamrud, and a site in North America that might be 19th-century Chicago, the cosmonauts' observations find no signs of industrial civilisation at all. They do, however, detect one other radio signal: a beacon of unknown origin located at the site of Babylon.\n\nAfter weeks of orbiting, the cosmonauts decide to bring the Soyuz down in central Asia, where their observations have noted signs of extensive, but still pre-industrial, habitation. From there they hope to make their way to Jamrud. Before re-entry, Musa suggests that calling this patchwork world \"Earth\" is inappropriate, and proposes the name \"Mir\" instead; not for the \"antique Russian space station\", but for the Russian word \"мир\", meaning both \"peace\" and \"world\".\n\nThe Soyuz lands successfully, but upon exiting the craft, Musa is decapitated by a Mongol warrior. Kolya, remembering a few words of Mongolian, manages to convince the Mongols that they are \"emissaries of Heaven\", and Sable and Kolya are loaded onto a cart heading east. They have arrived in the Mongol Empire of the 13th century, during the reign of Genghis Khan, to whom the \"emissaries\" are brought.\n\nAt the Khan's court, Kolya lays plans to use the Mongol army to enter China and rebuild the trading posts and towns that were lost in the Discontinuity. Sable disagrees, and instead proposes to take the army to Babylon. She hopes to find the unexplained radio beacon, believing it connected to whatever inconceivable event caused the Discontinuity, and thus the centre of power in \"Mir\". When Sable saves the Khan's life by shooting dead a sabre-toothed cat with her hidden side arm, Genghis accepts her as truly an emissary of Heaven, takes her to his bed, and agrees to her plan to take Babylon.\n\nMeanwhile, the British have encountered the army of Alexander the Great, on the march down the Indus after the revolt that ended Alexander's eastward expansion. Alexander is suffering from his injury in the Mallian Campaign, but recovers, and the British and Macedonian forces form an alliance. Their goal, too, is Babylon; Alexander wishes to return to the capital of his Persian empire, and the \"moderns\" wish to locate the radio beacon. Alexander's army arrives at Babylon before the Khan, and has time to explore it. A sphere at least three times larger than those previously seen is discovered in the Temple of Marduk, and is found to be the source of the radio signals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Khan's army reaches and sacks 19th-century Bishkek, massacring almost the entire population. Seeing this, Kolya plots against the Khan and Sable. As they near Babylon, he uses the radio equipment from the Soyuz to contact Casey and warn him of the coming Mongols. Sable catches Kolya in the act, but since the Mongols refuse to spill the \"royal blood\" of an emissary of Heaven, they blind and deafen him and throw him, alive, into a boarded-over pit.\n\nAn embassy from Alexander to the Mongols is rebuffed; Alexander's general Ptolemy is beheaded, and the survivors return mutilated. The defence of Babylon is organised, with the moderns introducing the Macedonians to guns and grenades. The combined Macedonian–British force meets the Mongols before the gates of the city. The defence is gradually worn down by the Mongols, and the shock of modern arms is blunted by Sable having prepared the Mongol troops, just as the British had the Macedonians.\n\nHowever, Kolya is still alive. Knowing more of the Mongols than Sable did, he had already guessed what their punishment of him would be: to bury him alive, beneath the yurt of the Khan himself. Having hidden a water supply and an improvised bomb on his person, he chooses his moment and detonates the bomb, killing the Khan.\n\nWhen the signal of the Khan's death reaches the field, most of the Mongols withdraw in order to hold a \"kurultai\". However, a small force remains under Sable's command. They break through the weakened defenders and head straight for the Temple of Marduk and the massive sphere, dubbed the \"Eye of Marduk\". Bisesa confronts Sable in the Temple and incapacitates her, but Ruddy is fatally shot.\n\nAlexander's lover Hephaestion died in the battle, but Alexander refuses the public mourning period and heavy drinking that, historically, may have been the cause of his death. Sable is executed, as is Cecil de Morgan, who had sold secrets to the Mongols and told Sable where to find the Eye of Marduk. The Macedonians and British settle in Babylon and establish a home there.\n\nBisesa spends all of her time studying the Eye of Marduk, becoming convinced that ancient, intelligent beings are observing them through it, and that she has been able to not only sense their presence, but communicate with them. Neither her friends' concern, nor an expedition with Alexander around the Mediterranean, nor her romantic relationship with Josh, distract her for long. Meanwhile, the British have again used an Eye to support the cage holding Seeker and Grasper, but the Eye begins to compel the \"man-apes\" to act in unusual ways, as if performing experiments on them.\n\nBisesa believes that the beings behind the Eye have agreed to grant her request: to take her home, to Earth. The beings do indeed use the Eye to take her away from Mir, together with Josh, who insists on accompanying her. However, their first destination is a blasted wasteland, possibly the result of nuclear devastation, and Bisesa concludes that they are in the far future, perhaps millions of years from their own time. Another Eye appears and takes Bisesa—and only Bisesa—away again; before she vanishes, they grant her plea to send Josh back to Mir instead of leaving him alone in the waste.\n\nAs the story concludes, there is a chapter from the point of view of the ancient beings, the \"Firstborn\", explaining that they arose in the early days of the universe, on a planet orbiting a powerful but short-lived star. When their star died, they saw it as the beginning of the heat death of the universe. Wanting to stop anything that might hasten the end of the universe and thus the end of intelligent life, they set out to find other intelligent beings developing advanced technology, and to stop them before they can develop to the point of consuming \"too much\" energy.\n\nOn Mir, Seeker and Grasper have been released, but Grasper, changed by her time under the Eye, begins to imagine a future for her kind in this world, a future of successfully competing with the \"newer\" \"Homo\" humans. Lastly, Bisesa arrives on Earth, in her home in London, the day after her helicopter flight. Her eight-year-old daughter Myra is there, and Bisesa promises to explain her sudden appearance and strange state, but then she sees an Eye floating over the city.\n\n"}

The amulet is a square copper object measuring approximately 5 cm on each side. Near one edge there is a small hole, presumably used for hanging it around the neck.\n\nThe inscription consists of some 143 runes, written \"boustrophedon\", supplemented by an engraving of a fish; the relevance of the fish to the text is unclear.\n\nThe inscription is one of the longest and best preserved for its time but it has proven hard to interpret. The \"official\" Rundata interpretation is:\n\nThere have been five other serious attempts to decipher the text. This article treats each in turn.\n\nBruce E. Nilsson was the first to offer an interpretation of the amulet. Ignoring what seem to be bind runes at the start of the inscription, he offered this transliteration:\n\nand the following translation into English:\n\nNilsson interprets: \"[T]he amulet is an invocation to the gods to protect Bove, especially while he is at sea.\" This he bases on the carving of the fish, the mention of the sea in the text and the place where the amulet was found.\n\nNilsson understands the mention of Thor and his hammer as a reference of the story of Thor's fishing; where he threw his hammer at the head of Jörmungandr, the Midgard serpent. Since Thor's hammer always returns to its thrower it might in this case be said that it 'fled from evil' and 'came from the sea'.\n\nNilsson does not attempt to solve the first few runic symbols of the inscription. He ventures a guess that they might conceal the name or cognomen of a god. The fish looks more promising to Nilsson. He suggests that it might contain coded runes. The fins of the fish can, according to him, be represented graphically as:\n\nThis might represent the runes 'nbh' in some order. Nilsson suggests that the meaning is based on the names of the runes; thus the amulet should give a björg from hagl and nauð or a \"deliverance\" from \"hail\" and \"need\". He adds that this is \"not at all certain\".\n\nUnfortunately Nilsson's interpretation is not treated critically by later authors.\n\nIvar Lindquist took some 30 years to ponder the amulet. He offers a plethora of interpretations - all, however, within the same central theme. According to Lindquist the amulet contains a solemn prayer to the Earth Goddess, referred to as 'Erka', 'Fold' and 'Undirgoð' (:the god beneath) and her 'single son' Thor.\n\nTwo of Lindquist's suggested interpretations are:\nAlso:\nOn etymological grounds Lindquist reasons that Ámr is a demon of sickness.\n\nAccording to Westlund, Lindquist's attempts at deciphering the \"bind runes\" at the beginning of the inscription are misguided. In Westlund's opinion these are not complicated bind runes but elaborate forms of normal runes. To support his claim he compares the runes with an inscription found near Novgorod in 1983 and treated by the Russian runologist Elena Melnikova in 1987. This is material not available to Lindquist and Nilsson.\n\nWestlund reads the first runes as \"hiristikþirbirkbufi\" and takes them to mean (in standardized West Norse) \"Hér rísti ek þér björg Bófi.\" which would come out in English as \"Here I carve protection for you, Bófi.\" This is a major change from Lindquist's interpretation. Instead of Bófi being the carver talking about himself we have a separate carver that addresses Bófi in the inscription.\n\nWestlund goes on to refuse Lindquist's \"prayer to Earth\" in favor of a more magical interpretation. While he rejects Lindquist's interpretation of \"mefultihuþis\" (\"with Earth in mind\") and Nilsson's interpretation of \"samhuhafikam\" (\"that came from the sea\") he does not offer alternative explanations. On the whole he suggests that Lindquist read too much into the inscription and tries to go for a more \"mundane\" solution to the problem. His transliteration and translation of the whole inscription follow:\n\nx hiristik þi birk / bufi me fultihu / þis þe uis in bral / tilu fran bufa þor keti h / ans mi þem hamri samhu / hafikam fly fran iluit fe eki af bufa kuþ iu / unti hanum auk yfi han / um\nIn his conclusion Westlund rejects Lindquist's view of the amulet as a solemn heathen prayer. In his opinion the mention of Thor and 'the gods' reflect a post-conversion magical view of the heathen gods. He even goes as far as suggesting that the wearer of the amulet was probably a baptised Christian.\n\nIn 1992 Ottar Grønvik offered a new interpretation which is essentially an attempt to rehabilitate Lindquist's work. Lindquist's bind-runes are brought back into play.\n\nIn 2001 Jonna Louis-Jensen continued in the same vein as Grønvik with an interpretation involving a sickness demon named \"Ámr\". She offers the following normalized text and English translation.\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

Its key signature consists of four sharps.\n\nThe C-sharp natural minor scale is:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nChanges needed for the melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary. The C-sharp harmonic minor and melodic minor scales are:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n</score>\n\nIts relative major is E major. Its parallel major, C-sharp major, is usually replaced by D-flat major, since C-sharp major, which contains seven sharps, is not normally used. Its enharmonic equivalent, D-flat minor, having eight flats, including the B, has a similar problem. Therefore, C-sharp minor is often used as the parallel minor for D-flat major. (The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of A-flat major and G-sharp minor.)\n\nThere are only two known symphonies in the 18th century written in this key. One of them is by Joseph Martin Kraus, but he appears to have found the key difficult since he later rewrote it in C minor. Even in the following two centuries, C-sharp minor symphonies remained rare. Two notable examples are the first movement of Mahler's Symphony No. 5 and Prokofiev's Symphony No. 7.\n\nThis key occurs more often in piano literature from the 18th century onwards. Domenico Scarlatti wrote just two keyboard sonatas in C-sharp minor, K. 246 and K. 247. But after Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 (\"Moonlight Sonata\"), the key became more frequent in the piano repertoire. Beethoven himself used this key again in the outer movements of his String Quartet No. 14 (Op. 131, 1826). Even so, Johannes Brahms still felt the need to rewrite his C-sharp minor piano quartet in C minor, which was published as Piano Quartet No. 3 in C minor, Op. 60.\n\nAlkan composed the second movement (Adagio) for Concerto for Solo Piano in C-sharp minor.\n\nFrédéric Chopin often wrote in this key: examples include the \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\", Étude Op. 25, No. 7, Scherzo No. 3 (Op. 39), Waltz Op. 64, No. 2, and Nocturnes No. 7 (Op. 27, No. 1) and No. 20 (\"Lento con gran espressione\"). More examples of works in C-sharp minor include Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor (Op. 3, No. 2), Scriabin's Étude in C-sharp minor, Op. 2, No. 1 (Scriabin), Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, and Tchaikovsky's Piano Sonata in C-sharp minor.\n\nPiano concertos written in C-sharp minor include Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, Op. 17, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's Piano Concerto, and others by Ferdinand Ries, Xaver Scharwenka, Amy Beach, Miriam Hyde and Issay Dobrowen. Dmitri Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 2 is in C-sharp minor.\n\nJules Van Nuffel wrote his psalm setting for choir and organ in C-sharp minor.\n"}

There have actually been 3 characters, all virtually identical in appearance and ability, to go by this title. The original Razor Fist was killed off in the comic books many years ago. The next two characters to take the title were brothers. The current Razor Fist is the only surviving brother.\n\nThe first Razor-Fist was an assassin, bodyguard, and enforcer employed by Carlton Velcro, working at Velcro's estate on the coast of the Gulf of Lions, southern France. Velcro surgically replaced this man's hands with steel blades. Razor Fist battled Shang-Chi, and was accidentally shot to death by Carlton Velcro's guards.\n\nDoctor Doom later constructed two robot duplicates of Razor Fist, which he pitted against Shang-Chi.\n\nCalled Razor-Fist because of his fast punches, this man and his brother took the same title and pretended to be only one person. Each brother lost one hand in a car accident, which were subsequently replaced by long knife-like stabbing weapons by Carlton Velcro. Velcro employed the brothers at his mansion on an island in the Marquesas. The brothers were assigned by Velcro to hunt down Shang-Chi and Pavane. This Razor-Fist was accidentally shot to death by Velcro.\n\nWhen the current Razor-Fist and his brother battled Shang-Chi, this one was defeated and captured by Shang-Chi and Pavane. Sometime after the first brother was killed the other brother (the current Razor Fist) lost his other hand. This happened in the Daughters of the Dragon mini-series. When he came up against Colleen Wing, she managed to sever his hand.\n\nRazor-Fist later appeared with blades on both hands. He teamed with Zaran and Shockwave to attack the West Coast Avengers on behalf of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Deltites. Razor Fist was defeated by Mockingbird, but he escaped.\n\nLater, he began working for the crime lord Roche in Madripoor, was assigned to kill Wolverine. With the assistance of a mutant pseudo-vampire, he overpowered Wolverine and was able to knock the weakened Wolverine off a cliff. The mutant, Sapphire Styx, had drained all of Wolverine's strength with her vampiric powers. When next they fought, Wolverine barely beat him and appeared to kill him. Razor Fist's recovery from this seemingly fatal encounter has never been explained. \n\nFully recovered, Razor Fist fought Hawkeye in an attempt to collect a reward for Hawkeye's right arm from Crossfire. He was defeated by Hawkeye, but joined in Crossfire's mass attack on Hawkeye. He was defeated by Mockingbird again and taken into police custody.\n\nRazor Fist was also apparently killed by Elektra when he attempted to claim a bounty that had been put on her head. As with his previous apparent death his survival has not been explained. When he next appeared, battling Spider-Man, he had a set of cybernetic prostheses with blades attached. These were severed and broken by another martial artist named Cat. After this encounter Razor Fist was sent to prison.\n\nIn the wake of the great supervillain breakout in the pages of \"New Avengers\", Razor Fist escaped along with all the other villains. He has recently appeared in the \"Toxin\" miniseries. There, he replaced both of his prosthetic hands with actual razors, and attracted a group of young children who are victims of self-harm. He was then easily defeated by the hero and returned to prison.\n\nRazor Fist since been hired by the Hood to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He later attacked the Enforcers, and Mister Fear's other bodyguards. The fight is interrupted by Daredevil who takes out Wrecker and Razor Fist who is also working for the Hood, unintentionally allowing the Enforcers to escape. He helped them fight the New Avengers but was taken down by Dr. Strange. In Secret Invasion, he is among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading Skrull force. He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the Dark Avengers instead. Scorcher, Living Laser, Griffin, and Razor Fist are sent by the Hood to retrieve Tigra and Gauntlet after they flee from Norman Osborn. They attack the heroes, who are ultimately saved by Counter Force.\n\nHe was seen during the battle of Camp: HAMMER, until the Hood ordered him to teleport to aid Osborn in Siege of Asgard. During the battle a civilian family was hurt when the Sentry caused the entire kingdom of Asgard to collapse. The husband finds both Bucky Barnes and Steve Rogers as Captain America and asked them to help locate his family in the rubble. They find his wife but see his two daughters in the clutches of Razor Fist. Both Avengers defeat Razor Fist and leave him tied up as they search for their friends who are trapped underneath the rubble. After the battle was over, Razor Fist was arrested along with other members of the Hood's gang.\n\nUnder the employ of White Dragon, Razor Fist murders undercover MI-6 agent Leiko Wu, the lover of his leader's rival Triad clan leader Skull-Crusher, in London's Chinatown. Razor Fist and some of White Dragon's men attempt to attack Shang-Chi, who was in London investigating Leiko's death but are thwarted by the Daughters of the Dragon and flee the fight when Shang-Chi recognizes the tattoo of the Mao Shan Pai, a powerful black magic, on one of White Dragon's men. After Midnight Sun, Shang-Chi's brother and the true mastermind behind White Dragon, accidentally resurrects Leiko with the Mao Shan Pai, Razor Fist attempts to kill her a second time, only to be brutally beaten down by the black magic wielding Leiko, who then proceeds to painfully rip the blades from his arms. Before she could finish him off, she is stopped by Shang-Chi. Razor Fist and White Dragon's men are later taken into custody by Black Jack Tarr and MI-6. \n\nDuring the \"Search for Tony Stark\" arc, Razor Fist rejoined Hood's gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom.\n\nRazor Fist is part of a group of Shang-Chi's enemies that includes Shen Kuei, Shockwave, Death-Hand, Shadow Stalker, Tiger-Claw and others led by Midnight Sun that ambushes the Master of Kung Fu and Domino while the two are on a date in Hong Kong. The group is quickly defeated by the two. After the fight, Shang-Chi warns the group to retreat and forget the ambush ever took place or to face further attacks from Domino.\n\nEach Razor Fist has no known superhuman powers. However, each Razor Fist's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes & reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance are honed to the peak of human conditioning. The first Razor Fist's hands were both surgically replaced with steel blades which he used as weapons, while the latter two Razor Fists initially had only one hand replaced with a steel blade. The last remaining Razor Fist eventually had his other hand replaced by a similar blade as well.\n\nEach Razor Fist is highly skilled in multiple forms of hand to razor fist combat, with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts.\n\nIn the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, a version of Razor Fist exists in the \"wuxia\"-inspired K'un-L'un domain of Battleworld. In this reality, Razor Fist is a student of the Ten Rings school and an enforcer of Emperor Zheng Zu, the Master of the Ten Rings. His is a master of The Mortal Blade, a Ten Rings technique that makes his hands razor sharp. Razor Fist, along with fellow Ten Rings members Typhus and Nighthawk attempt to arrest Shang-Chi, the exiled son of the emperor, only to be easily defeated by the Master of Kung Fu. For his failure, Emperor Zu cuts off both of Razor Fist's hands as punishment. \n\n\n"}

They sought to join together to prevent their wives and daughters being raped by soldiers of both sides, themselves being forcibly conscripted to fight by one side or the other, their crops and property being damaged or seized by the armies and their lives threatened or intimidated by soldiers, battle followers, looters, deserters or refugees. As their name suggests, they were mostly armed with cudgels, flails, scythes and sickles fastened to long poles. They were otherwise unarmed.\n\nInitially Clubmen gatherings came together spontaneously in response to the actions of soldiers in their localities. But as the war went on Clubmen in some areas were organised by the local gentry and churchmen and were a force which both sides in the war had to take into account when planning a campaign and garrisoning some areas, particularly in the south and west. The Clubmen, distinguishing themselves by white ribbands, were of a third party, neither Royalist nor Parliamentarian, and they were repressed severely by the authorities on both sides. Though Lord Fairfax met with clubmen and negotiated with them, eventually he moved against them. \n\nOrganised Clubmen in Worcestershire met on Woodbury Hill on 5 March 1645 and under the leadership of Charles Nott, the Parson of Shelsley drew up the Woodbury Declaration, which protests at the \"utter ruin by the outrages and violence of the soldier; threatening to fire our houses; endeavouring to ravish our wives and daughters, and menacing our persons\", and presented it to Henry Bromley (of Holt), the Royalist High Sheriff of Worcestershire.\n\nIn Dorset, on 2 August 1645, Colonel Charles Fleetwood surrounded and dispersed 1,000 Clubmen at Shaftesbury. Stiffer resistance was met by Cromwell in attacking a larger group in the ancient hillfort on Hambledon Hill. An hour's fighting killed 60 Clubmen and captured 400, half of whom were wounded. They were held in the church at Shroton. Parliamentarian sources claimed that they had been stirred up by \"malignant priests\", for vicars and curates were among the captives. Those who swore to the Covenant were subsequently released, the others sent to London.\n\n\n"}

Previously used for road traffic, the bridge now carries pedestrian and Luas (tram) traffic. \n\nOriginally designed by George Papworth to carry horsedrawn traffic, the foundation stone was laid on 12 December 1827. The iron castings for the bridge were produced at the Royal Phoenix Iron Works in nearby Parkgate Street. (The foundry which also produced the parapets for the upstream Lucan Bridge).

He was the first African American elected to Congress from Maryland.\n\nMitchell was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father, Clarence M. Mitchell, Sr., was a waiter, and his mother, Elsie Davis Mitchell, was a homemaker. Mitchell graduated from Frederick Douglass Senior High School in Baltimore in 1940. Mitchell served as an officer in the 92nd Infantry Division during World War II, and was wounded in Italy; he received the Purple Heart. He earned his bachelor's degree from Morgan State University, and his master's degree from the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1950, Mitchell sued the then segregated University of Maryland for admission to the graduate school with support from the Baltimore Branch of the NAACP, and won admission. When he graduated he was the first African-American to do so from that school.\n\nBefore entering graduate school, Mitchell participated in the early civil rights activity in Baltimore. These included protests against segregated seating at Ford's Theatre in downtown Baltimore City, and unequal funding for teacher training programs in the city's segregated black school system in 1948. Parren Mitchell was the brother of the late Clarence Mitchell Jr., who was head of the NAACP's Washington office and was one of Lyndon Johnson's chief advisers during the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn 1968, Mitchell challenged nine-term Democratic incumbent Samuel Friedel in the Democratic primary and lost. He sought a rematch in 1970, and this time defeated Friedel by only 38 votes. He then breezed to an election in November, becoming the first African-American elected to Congress from Maryland. After the 1970 census, the 7th was redrawn as a black-majority district—Maryland's first. Mitchell was reelected seven more times from this district, never dropping below 75 percent of the vote. He even ran unopposed in 1974 and 1984 and only faced minor-party opposition in 1976 and 1978.\n\nMitchell was one of the founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mitchell immediately became a vocal member of the caucus with one of his first actions with the caucus, numbering 12 at the time, was to boycott President Richard M. Nixon’s State of the Union address in 1971 after Nixon had refused to meet the group. Eventually, Nixon met the caucus weeks later.\n\nDuring his 16-year career, he fought for affirmative action legislation. As Chairman of the Small Business Committee, Mitchell attached an amendment to a $4 billion public works bill that compelled state and local governments, seeking federal grants, to set aside 10% of the funds to retain minority firms as contractors and subcontractors.\n\nMitchell also mentored several dozen young up and coming leaders, several of whom still hold public office. Maryland House of Delegates majority whip Talmadge Branch was an early aide, Delegate Nathaniel Oaks volunteered in Mitchell's early campaigns, as did Delegates Sandy Rosenberg and Curt Anderson.\n\nMitchell initiated a congressional investigation into Wedtech where bribes were alleged to have been offered in return for no bid military contracts. His nephews State Senators Clarence Mitchell III and Michael Mitchell ended up serving time in Federal prison for their parts in the scandal. In 1986 Mitchell retired from Congress to run unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Maryland as the running mate of Attorney General Stephen H. Sachs. In later years, after a series of strokes, he was placed in a nursing home but still made periodic appearances at community events.\n\nMitchell died on 28 May 2007 of pneumonia at Greater Baltimore Medical Center in Towson, Maryland, after being hospitalized for a week.

{"id": "2046372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046372", "title": "Warini", "text": "Warini\n\nThe Varini, Warni or Warini were one or more Germanic peoples who originally lived in what is now northeastern Germany, near the Baltic sea. \n\nThey are first named in the Roman era, but appear to have survived into the Middle Ages. It is proposed that in Old English they were called Werns or Warns. \n\nTacitus spelled the name as \"Varini\", Pliny the Elder as \"Varinnae\", Ptolemy \"Viruni\" ', Procopius as \"Varni\" ('). Later attestions include Wærne or Werne in the Old English \"Widsith\", and Warnii in the \"Lex Thuringorum\".\n\nThe name supposedly meant \"defenders\", \"living by the river\" (from the Indo-European root \"water, rain, river\").\n\nThe earliest mention of this tribe appears in Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" (published about 77 AD). He wrote that there were five Germanic races, and one of these were the Vandals. These included the \"Burgodiones\", the \"Varinnae\", the Charini (not know from any other record) and the Gutones (Goths).\n\nTacitus (about AD 56 – 120) gave the most information about the Varini in his \"Germania\". He mentioned them as one of a group of remote Suevian peoples, living beyond (north and/or east of) the Semnones and Langobardi (who lived near the Elbe). He did not mention that they were Vandili.\n\nSurviving versions of the second century \"Geography\" by Ptolemy included the (Greek ) in the description of \"Germania\", but these are difficult to interpret and have apparently become corrupted. These describe the Viruni as being near the otherwise unknown \"\"Teutonoari\"\". Gudmund Schütte suggested that this name is an error combining the Teutones and \"Aoaroi\", and would equate the later to the Varini (\"Ouarni\") as a doubling-up error. Together these two peoples were surrounded by:\n\nThis is perhaps in the area of Mecklenburg, where one of the main rivers is Warnow and a town is called Warnemünde.\n\nPtolemy also plotted the position of a town named \"Virunum\" at 40°30' longitude and 55° latitude using his system. This was however east of the Chalusus river, between the \"Suevus\" and \"Viadua\" rivers, which both lay between the Chalusus and the Vistula according to him. The town () has been identified as somewhere near modern-day Drawsko Pomorskie.\n\nThe Warini were mentioned by Procopius in the 6th century, implying that the Varini had a very large territory in his time. Procopius situates the bordering the Franks, with only the river Rhine between them, but also stretching to the coast. Their king Hermegisclus had made a strategic alliance with the Frankish ruler Theudebert I (died 547/548), marrying his sister Theudechild. As the king died, the satraps compelled his son Radigis to marry his stepmother. The son, however, was already engaged with a British queen, who crossed the North Sea with an army of 400 ships and 100.000 men, seeking retaliation. Radigis was caught hiding in a wood not far from the mouth of the Rhine and had no other choice than to marry his fiancée. \n\nHe also wrote in passing that when the Heruls (Eruli) had been defeated by the Lombards, some of them moved to Scandinavia (which he called Thule). When other Heruls sought to find them years later, they crossed the Danube (Ister), went through the lands of the Slavs (Sclaveni) and after a barren region, they came to the land of the Warni. After these Warni they passed through the land of the Danes, and then crossed the sea from there to Scandinavia, where they found them living with the Geats (Gautoi). \n\nOthers, however, question Procopius's reliability for this northern region. Modern scholars claim that the area north of the Rhine may have been under Frankish control during the greater parts of the 6th and 7th centuries, at least since the defeat of the Danish sea-king Hygelac in 526.\n\nAccording to the chronicle of Fredegar the \"Varni\" or \"Warni\" rebelled against the Merovingian Franks in 594 and were bloodily defeated by Childebert II in 595 (the year he died) \"so that few of them survived\".\n\nThe Warini also appear in the title of a 9th-century legal codex, \"Lex Angliorum, Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum\" (Law of the Angles and Warini, that is, of the Thuringians), which has much in common with Frankisch, Frisian and Saxon law codes. \n\nRecent research suggests that they were part of a Thuringian federation, which dominated Northern Germany from Atilla's death in 453 to the middle of the 6th century when they were crushed by the Franks. Their military fame might explain why the names of the Warini and Thuringians have been mentioned in a much wider area, extending even beyond the Rhine. Their home country seems to have been the district between the rivers Saale and Elster, which was called \"Werenofeld\" (around Eisleben). \n\nWhen the region east of the Elbe became Slavic-speaking, a group in this region continued to be called Warnabi, perhaps representing assimilated Varni.\n\nThe Warini are mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon poem \"Widsith\" as the \"Wærne\" or \"Werne\".\n\nThe name Billing, mentioned in \"Widsith\", might be related to the ancestors of the Saxon Billung-family.\n\n\n"}

M. P. Nash, USNRF, in command.\n\nAssigned to the Naval Transport Service, \"Rapidan\" remained in commission for only 6 months, most of which was spent at Norfolk. Ordered inactivated in March, \"Rapidan\" decommissioned 22 June 1922 and was berthed with the James River Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, until recommissioned 22 January 1940, Lt. Comdr. J. B. Mallard in command.\n\nFor the 18 months following her second commissioning, \"Rapidan\" carried fuel from the Texas oil ports to ships and stations in the Caribbean and along the U.S. Atlantic coast. Between September 1941 and November 1942, she supplied petroleum products to Atlantic Fleet units at Halifax, NS Argentia, Reykjavík, Hvalfjörður, and various ports in Greenland. Then, after overhaul, she served as escort oiler on a convoy to Casablanca. On her return to New York, in early February 1943, \"Rapidan\" resumed operations off the northeast coast, steaming between New York, Boston, Portland, Maine, and Argentia until April when she got underway for her first Mediterranean convoy. Fueling units en route, she arrived at Gibraltar 24 May, continued on to Oran, discharged her cargo, then returned to the United States and coastal operations. In July while at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, the Rapidan had installed new secret Mark 29 \"anti torpedo\" gear. In September she resumed Caribbean operations and on the 11th was damaged by an underwater explosion some 100 yards off the starboard quarter from a torpedo. The explosion of the torpedo was caused by the anti torpedo gear and it resulted in damage to the hull plates. Repairs were completed at Charleston; and, on the 25th, she resumed her oil runs, operating as far south as the Netherlands West Indies, and as far north as Argentia.\n\nIn March 1944 \"Rapidan\" was ordered to the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal 19 March, she steamed up the west coast to Seattle, whence she carried her liquid cargo to Kodiak, Cold Bay, Dutch Harbor, and other Aleutian ports. Including periodic assignments as station tanker at Attu and Adak, the oiler continued on the Alaskan shuttle until 28 June 1946. Then, ordered back to the east coast, she transited the Panama Canal 2 August and on the 11th reported to the 5th Naval District for inactivation.\n\nDecommissioned 17 September 1946 at Portsmouth, Virginia, \"Rapidan\" was transferred to the Maritime Commission 18 September 1946 and her name was struck from the Navy List 29 October 1946. On 10 September 1947 she was sold to the Northern Metals Co. for scrap.\n\nThe wartime skipper of the USS Rapidan, Captain Thomas Harris Moriarty, died in southern Alabama on 9 October 2009 at the age of 91, two weeks after attending a reunion of the ship's crew.\n\n\n"}

It was composed between 11 August 1810 and 12 January 1811 and has set numbers with recitative and spoken dialogue. The work is a Singspiel in the then popular Turkish style.\n\n\"Abu Hassan\" was first performed at the Residenz Theater in Munich on 4 June 1811, conducted by the composer. In London, it was produced in English at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1835, and in Italian at Drury Lane on 12 May 1870 (at the same time as Mozart's \"L'oca del Cairo\"), the translation being made by , and the dialogue set to recitative by Luigi Arditi.\n\n\"Abu Hassan\" is not now part of the commonly performed operatic repertory, though it is sometimes staged. The overture is, however, well known and has been recorded separately many times.\n\nAbu Hassan, a favorite of the Caliph of Baghdad, is heavily in debt. To retrieve his fortunes, he sends his wife Fatime to the Caliph's wife, Zobeide, to announce his (Hassan's) death, for which Fatime will receive 50 pieces of gold and a piece of brocade. After Fatime has set off, creditors enter Abu Hassan's house to collect money. Omar, the richest creditor, is tricked into believing that Fatime has spoken to him of love, so he agrees to pay all the other creditors.\n\nFatime returns with the presents from Zobeide. Abu Hassan now goes to visit the Caliph, intending to try a similar story about his wife and get money from him. While he is out, Omar reappears and demands a kiss from Fatime, but Abu Hassan returns. Omar hides in an adjoining room, and the husband and wife enjoy his fear of being discovered.\n\nNow Mesrur, a messenger from the Caliph, arrives, to see if Fatime really is dead. Both the Caliph and his wife want to know who it was who died, and if both, who died first. Mesrur, seeing Fatime lying on the divan, her husband in apparent distress at her side, runs back to tell the Caliph. He has only just gone, when Zobeide's nurse runs in on a similar errand. This time it is Hassan who feigns death, while Fatime is all tears and lamenting.\n\nFinally the Caliph and his wife are announced. Hassan and Fatime throw themselves on the divan, covering themselves, as if dead. The Caliph now offers 1,000 gold pieces to anyone who will tell him which of them died first. Hassan revives and throws himself at the Caliph's feet, saying \"It was me - I died first!\" He asks for a pardon, as well as the gold. Fatime does likewise, and the Caliph pardons them both. Omar, having paid off Hassan's debts in the hope of winning Fatime's heart, is sent away in disgrace.\n\nThe opera has been recorded by Wolfgang Sawallisch, Leopold Ludwig, and Gennady Rozhdestvensky, the last in Russian.

Heat is created when nuclear fuel undergoes nuclear fission.\n\nMost nuclear fuels contain heavy fissile actinide elements that are capable of undergoing and sustaining nuclear fission. The three most relevant fissile isotopes are uranium-233, uranium-235 and plutonium-239. When the unstable nuclei of these atoms are hit by a slow-moving neutron, they split, creating two daughter nuclei and two or three more neutrons. These neutrons then go on to split more nuclei. This creates a self-sustaining chain reaction that is controlled in a nuclear reactor, or uncontrolled in a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe processes involved in mining, refining, purifying, using, and disposing of nuclear fuel are collectively known as the nuclear fuel cycle.\n\nNot all types of nuclear fuels create power from nuclear fission; plutonium-238 and some other elements are used to produce small amounts of nuclear power by radioactive decay in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and other types of atomic batteries.\n\nNuclear fuel has the highest energy density of all practical fuel sources.\n\nFor fission reactors, the fuel (typically based on uranium) is usually based on the metal oxide; the oxides are used rather than the metals themselves because the oxide melting point is much higher than that of the metal and because it cannot burn, being already in the oxidized state.\n\nUranium dioxide is a black semiconducting solid. It can be made by reacting uranyl nitrate with a base (ammonia) to form a solid (ammonium uranate). It is heated (calcined) to form UO that can then be converted by heating in an argon / hydrogen mixture (700 °C) to form UO. The UO is then mixed with an organic binder and pressed into pellets, these pellets are then fired at a much higher temperature (in H/Ar) to sinter the solid. The aim is to form a dense solid which has few pores.\n\nThe thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide is very low compared with that of zirconium metal, and it goes down as the temperature goes up.\n\nCorrosion of uranium dioxide in water is controlled by similar electrochemical processes to the galvanic corrosion of a metal surface.\n\nMixed oxide, or MOX fuel, is a blend of plutonium and natural or depleted uranium which behaves similarly (though not identically) to the enriched uranium feed for which most nuclear reactors were designed. MOX fuel is an alternative to low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel used in the light water reactors which predominate nuclear power generation.\n\nSome concern has been expressed that used MOX cores will introduce new disposal challenges, though MOX is itself a means to dispose of surplus plutonium by transmutation.\n\nReprocessing of commercial nuclear fuel to make MOX was done in the Sellafield MOX Plant (England). As of 2015, MOX fuel is made in France (see Marcoule Nuclear Site), and to a lesser extent in Russia (see Mining and Chemical Combine), India and Japan. China plans to develop fast breeder reactors (see CEFR) and reprocessing.\n\nThe Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, was a U.S. proposal in the George W. Bush Administration to form an international partnership to see spent nuclear fuel reprocessed in a way that renders the plutonium in it usable for nuclear fuel but not for nuclear weapons. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel has not been permitted in the United States due to nonproliferation considerations. All of the other reprocessing nations have long had nuclear weapons from military-focused \"research\"-reactor fuels except for Japan. Normally, with the fuel being changed every three years or so, about half of the Pu-239 is 'burned' in the reactor, providing about one third of the total energy. It behaves like U-235 and its fission releases a similar amount of energy. The higher the burn-up, the more plutonium in the spent fuel, but the lower the fraction of fissile plutonium. Typically about one percent of the used fuel discharged from a reactor is plutonium, and some two thirds of this is fissile (c. 50% Pu-239, 15% Pu-241). Worldwide, some 70 tonnes of plutonium contained in used fuel is removed when refueling reactors each year.\n\nMetal fuels have the advantage of a much higher heat conductivity than oxide fuels but cannot survive equally high temperatures. Metal fuels have a long history of use, stretching from the Clementine reactor in 1946 to many test and research reactors. Metal fuels have the potential for the highest fissile atom density. Metal fuels are normally alloyed, but some metal fuels have been made with pure uranium metal. Uranium alloys that have been used include uranium aluminium, uranium zirconium, uranium silicon, uranium molybdenum, and uranium zirconium hydride (UZrH). Any of the aforementioned fuels can be made with plutonium and other actinides as part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Metal fuels have been used in water reactors and liquid metal fast breeder reactors, such as EBR-II.\n\nTRIGA fuel is used in TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomics) reactors.\nThe TRIGA reactor uses UZrH fuel, which has a prompt negative fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, meaning that as the temperature of the core increases, the reactivity decreases—so it is highly unlikely for a meltdown to occur. Most cores that use this fuel are \"high leakage\" cores where the excess leaked neutrons can be utilized for research. TRIGA fuel was originally designed to use highly enriched uranium, however in 1978 the U.S. Department of Energy launched its Reduced Enrichment for Research Test Reactors program, which promoted reactor conversion to low-enriched uranium fuel. A total of 35 TRIGA reactors have been installed at locations across the US. A further 35 reactors have been installed in other countries.\n\nIn a fast neutron reactor, the minor actinides produced by neutron capture of uranium and plutonium can be used as fuel. Metal actinide fuel is typically an alloy of zirconium, uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides. It can be made inherently safe as thermal expansion of the metal alloy will increase neutron leakage.\n\nMolten plutonium, alloyed with other metals to lower its melting point and encapsulated in tantalum, was tested in two experimental reactors, LAMPRE I and LAMPRE II, at LANL in the 1960s. \"LAMPRE experienced three separate fuel failures during operation.\"\n\nCeramic fuels other than oxides have the advantage of high heat conductivities and melting points, but they are more prone to swelling than oxide fuels and are not understood as well.\n\nThis is often the fuel of choice for reactor designs that NASA produces, one advantage is that UN has a better thermal conductivity than UO. Uranium nitride has a very high melting point. This fuel has the disadvantage that unless N was used (in place of the more common N) that a large amount of C would be generated from the nitrogen by the (n,p) reaction. As the nitrogen required for such a fuel would be so expensive it is likely that the fuel would have to be reprocessed by pyroprocessing to enable the N to be recovered. It is likely that if the fuel was processed and dissolved in nitric acid that the nitrogen enriched with N would be diluted with the common N.\n\nMuch of what is known about uranium carbide is in the form of pin-type fuel elements for liquid metal fast reactors during their intense study during the 1960s and 1970s. However, recently there has been a revived interest in uranium carbide in the form of plate fuel and most notably, micro fuel particles (such as TRISO particles).\n\nThe high thermal conductivity and high melting point makes uranium carbide an attractive fuel. In addition, because of the absence of oxygen in this fuel (during the course of irradiation, excess gas pressure can build from the formation of O or other gases) as well as the ability to complement a ceramic coating (a ceramic-ceramic interface has structural and chemical advantages), uranium carbide could be the ideal fuel candidate for certain Generation IV reactors such as the gas-cooled fast reactor.\n\nLiquid fuels are liquids containing dissolved nuclear fuel and have been shown to offer numerous operational advantages compared to traditional solid fuel approaches.\n\nLiquid-fuel reactors offer significant safety advantages due to their inherently stable \"self-adjusting\" reactor dynamics. This provides two major benefits:\n- virtually eliminating the possibility of a run-away reactor meltdown,\n- providing an automatic load-following capability which is well suited to electricity generation and high-temperature industrial heat applications.\n\nAnother major advantage of the liquid core is its ability to be drained rapidly into a passively safe dump-tank. This advantage was conclusively demonstrated repeatedly as part of a weekly shutdown procedure during the highly successful 4 year Molten Salt Reactor Experiment.\n\nAnother huge advantage of the liquid core is its ability to release xenon gas which normally acts as a neutron absorber and causes structural occlusions in solid fuel elements (leading to the early replacement of solid fuel rods with over 98% of the nuclear fuel unburned, including many long-lived actinides). In contrast, Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) are capable of retaining the fuel mixture for significantly extended periods, which not only increases fuel efficiency dramatically but also incinerates the vast majority of its own waste as part of the normal operational characteristics.\n\nMolten salt fuels have nuclear fuel dissolved directly in the molten salt coolant. Molten salt-fueled reactors, such as the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR), are different from molten salt-cooled reactors that do not dissolve nuclear fuel in the coolant.\n\nMolten salt fuels were used in the LFTR known as the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment, as well as other liquid core reactor experiments. The liquid fuel for the molten salt reactor was a mixture of lithium, beryllium, thorium and uranium fluorides: LiF-BeF-ThF-UF (72-16-12-0.4 mol%). It had a peak operating temperature of 705 °C in the experiment, but could have operated at much higher temperatures since the boiling point of the molten salt was in excess of 1400 °C.\n\nThe aqueous homogeneous reactors (AHRs) use a solution of uranyl sulfate or other uranium salt in water. Historically, AHRs have all been small research reactors, not large power reactors. An AHR known as the Medical Isotope Production System is being considered for production of medical isotopes.\n\nUranium dioxide (UO) powder is compacted to cylindrical pellets and sintered at high temperatures to produce ceramic nuclear fuel pellets with a high density and well defined physical properties and chemical composition. A grinding process is used to achieve a uniform cylindrical geometry with narrow tolerances. Such fuel pellets are then stacked and filled into the metallic tubes. The metal used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor. Stainless steel was used in the past, but most reactors now use a zirconium alloy which, in addition to being highly corrosion-resistant, has low neutron absorption. The tubes containing the fuel pellets are sealed: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped into fuel assemblies that are used to build up the core of a power reactor.\n\nCladding is the outer layer of the fuel rods, standing between the coolant and the nuclear fuel. It is made of a corrosion-resistant material with low absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, usually Zircaloy or steel in modern constructions, or magnesium with small amount of aluminium and other metals for the now-obsolete Magnox reactors. Cladding prevents radioactive fission fragments from escaping the fuel into the coolant and contaminating it.\n\nPressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel consists of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into Zircaloy tubes that are bundled together. The Zircaloy tubes are about 1 cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap is filled with helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179–264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted through the top directly into the fuel bundle. The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel that can lead to corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The Zircaloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.\n\nIn boiling water reactors (BWR), the fuel is similar to PWR fuel except that the bundles are \"canned\". That is, there is a thin tube surrounding each bundle. This is primarily done to prevent local density variations from affecting neutronics and thermal hydraulics of the reactor core. In modern BWR fuel bundles, there are either 91, 92, or 96 fuel rods per assembly depending on the manufacturer. A range between 368 assemblies for the smallest and 800 assemblies for the largest U.S. BWR forms the reactor core. Each BWR fuel rod is backfilled with helium to a pressure of about three atmospheres (300 kPa).\n\nCANDU fuel bundles are about a half meter long and 10 cm in diameter. They consist of sintered (UO) pellets in zirconium alloy tubes, welded to zirconium alloy end plates. Each bundle is roughly 20 kg, and a typical core loading is on the order of 4500–6500 bundles, depending on the design. Modern types typically have 37 identical fuel pins radially arranged about the long axis of the bundle, but in the past several different configurations and numbers of pins have been used. The CANFLEX bundle has 43 fuel elements, with two element sizes. It is also about 10 cm (4 inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20 in) long and weighs about 20 kg (44 lb) and replaces the 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. Current CANDU designs do not need enriched uranium to achieve criticality (due to their more efficient heavy water moderator), however, some newer concepts call for low enrichment to help reduce the size of the reactors.\n\nVarious other nuclear fuel forms find use in specific applications, but lack the widespread use of those found in BWRs, PWRs, and CANDU power plants. Many of these fuel forms are only found in research reactors, or have military applications.\n\nMagnox (magnesium non-oxidising) reactors are pressurised, carbon dioxide–cooled, graphite-moderated reactors using natural uranium (i.e. unenriched) as fuel and Magnox alloy as fuel cladding. Working pressure varies from 6.9 to 19.35 bar for the steel pressure vessels, and the two reinforced concrete designs operated at 24.8 and 27 bar. Magnox alloy consists mainly of magnesium with small amounts of aluminium and other metals—used in cladding unenriched uranium metal fuel with a non-oxidising covering to contain fission products. This material has the advantage of a low neutron capture cross-section, but has two major disadvantages:\n\n\nMagnox fuel incorporated cooling fins to provide maximum heat transfer despite low operating temperatures, making it expensive to produce. While the use of uranium metal rather than oxide made reprocessing more straightforward and therefore cheaper, the need to reprocess fuel a short time after removal from the reactor meant that the fission product hazard was severe. Expensive remote handling facilities were required to address this danger\nTristructural-isotropic (TRISO) fuel is a type of micro fuel particle. It consists of a fuel kernel composed of UO (sometimes UC or UCO) in the center, coated with four layers of three isotropic materials deposited through fluidized chemical vapor deposition (FCVD). The four layers are a porous buffer layer made of carbon that absorbs fission product recoils, followed by a dense inner layer of protective pyrolytic carbon (PyC), followed by a ceramic layer of SiC to retain fission products at elevated temperatures and to give the TRISO particle more structural integrity, followed by a dense outer layer of PyC. TRISO particles are then encapsulated into cylindrical or spherical graphite pellets. TRISO fuel particles are designed not to crack due to the stresses from processes (such as differential thermal expansion or fission gas pressure) at temperatures up to 1600 °C, and therefore can contain the fuel in the worst of accident scenarios in a properly designed reactor. Two such reactor designs are the prismatic-block gas-cooled reactor (such as the GT-MHR) and the pebble-bed reactor (PBR). Both of these reactor designs are high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs). These are also the basic reactor designs of very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), one of the six classes of reactor designs in the Generation IV initiative that is attempting to reach even higher HTGR outlet temperatures.\n\nTRISO fuel particles were originally developed in the United Kingdom as part of the Dragon reactor project. The inclusion of the SiC as diffusion barrier was first suggested by D. T. Livey. The first nuclear reactor to use TRISO fuels was the Dragon reactor and the first powerplant was the THTR-300. Currently, TRISO fuel compacts are being used in the experimental reactors, the HTR-10 in China, and the High-temperature engineering test reactor in Japan. Spherical fuel elements utilizing a TRISO particle with a UO and UC solid solution kernel are being used in the Xe-100 in the United States.\n\nIn QUADRISO particles a burnable neutron poison (europium oxide or erbium oxide or carbide) layer surrounds the fuel kernel of ordinary TRISO particles to better manage the excess of reactivity. If the core is equipped both with TRISO and QUADRISO fuels, at beginning of life neutrons do not reach the fuel of the QUADRISO particles because they are stopped by the burnable poison. During reactor operation, neutron irradiation of the poison causes it to \"burn up\" or progressively transmute to non-poison isotopes, depleting this poison effect and leaving progressively more neutrons available for sustaining the chain-reaction. This mechanism compensates for the accumulation of undesirable neutron poisons which are an unavoidable part of the fission products, as well as normal fissile fuel \"burn up\" or depletion. In the generalized QUADRISO fuel concept the poison can eventually be mixed with the fuel kernel or the outer pyrocarbon. The QUADRISO concept has been conceived at Argonne National Laboratory.\n\nRBMK reactor fuel was used in Soviet-designed and built RBMK-type reactors. This is a low-enriched uranium oxide fuel. The fuel elements in an RBMK are 3 m long each, and two of these sit back-to-back on each fuel channel, pressure tube. Reprocessed uranium from Russian VVER reactor spent fuel is used to fabricate RBMK fuel. Following the Chernobyl accident, the enrichment of fuel was changed from 2.0% to 2.4%, to compensate for control rod modifications and the introduction of additional absorbers.\n\nCerMet fuel consists of ceramic fuel particles (usually uranium oxide) embedded in a metal matrix. It is hypothesized that this type of fuel is what is used in United States Navy reactors. This fuel has high heat transport characteristics and can withstand a large amount of expansion.\n\nPlate-type fuel has fallen out of favor over the years. Plate-type fuel is commonly composed of enriched uranium sandwiched between metal cladding. Plate-type fuel is used in several research reactors where a high neutron flux is desired, for uses such as material irradiation studies or isotope production, without the high temperatures seen in ceramic, cylindrical fuel. It is currently used in the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory, and the nuclear research reactor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell Radiation Laboratory.\n\nSodium-bonded fuel consists of fuel that has liquid sodium in the gap between the fuel slug (or pellet) and the cladding. This fuel type is often used for sodium-cooled liquid metal fast reactors. It has been used in EBR-I, EBR-II, and the FFTF. The fuel slug may be metallic or ceramic. The sodium bonding is used to reduce the temperature of the fuel.\n\nAccident tolerant fuels (ATF) are a series of new nuclear fuel concepts, researched in order to improve fuel performance under accident conditions, such as loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) or reaction-initiated accidents (RIA). These concerns became more prominent after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, in particular regarding light-water reactor (LWR) fuels performance under accident conditions.\n\nThe aim of the research is to develop nuclear fuels that can tolerate loss of active cooling for a considerably longer period than the existing fuel designs and prevent or delay the release of radionuclides during an accident. This research is focused on reconsidering the design of fuel pellets and cladding, as well as the interactions between the two.\n\nUsed nuclear fuel is a complex mixture of the fission products, uranium, plutonium, and the transplutonium metals. In fuel which has been used at high temperature in power reactors it is common for the fuel to be \"heterogeneous\"; often the fuel will contain nanoparticles of platinum group metals such as palladium. Also the fuel may well have cracked, swollen, and been heated close to its melting point. Despite the fact that the used fuel can be cracked, it is very insoluble in water, and is able to retain the vast majority of the actinides and fission products within the uranium dioxide crystal lattice.\n\nTwo main modes of release exist, the fission products can be vaporised or small particles of the fuel can be dispersed.\n\nPost-Irradiation Examination (PIE) is the study of used nuclear materials such as nuclear fuel. It has several purposes. It is known that by examination of used fuel that the failure modes which occur during normal use (and the manner in which the fuel will behave during an accident) can be studied. In addition information is gained which enables the users of fuel to assure themselves of its quality and it also assists in the development of new fuels. After major accidents the core (or what is left of it) is normally subject to PIE to find out what happened. One site where PIE is done is the ITU which is the EU centre for the study of highly radioactive materials.\n\nMaterials in a high-radiation environment (such as a reactor) can undergo unique behaviors such as swelling and non-thermal creep. If there are nuclear reactions within the material (such as what happens in the fuel), the stoichiometry will also change slowly over time. These behaviors can lead to new material properties, cracking, and fission gas release.\n\nThe thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide is low; it is affected by porosity and burn-up. The burn-up results in fission products being dissolved in the lattice (such as lanthanides), the precipitation of fission products such as palladium, the formation of fission gas bubbles due to fission products such as xenon and krypton and radiation damage of the lattice. The low thermal conductivity can lead to overheating of the center part of the pellets during use. The porosity results in a decrease in both the thermal conductivity of the fuel and the swelling which occurs during use.\n\nAccording to the International Nuclear Safety Center the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide can be predicted under different conditions by a series of equations.\n\nThe bulk density of the fuel can be related to the thermal conductivity\n\nWhere \"ρ\" is the bulk density of the fuel and \"ρ\" is the theoretical density of the uranium dioxide.\n\nThen the thermal conductivity of the porous phase (\"K\") is related to the conductivity of the perfect phase (\"K\", no porosity) by the following equation. Note that \"s\" is a term for the shape factor of the holes.\n\nRather than measuring the thermal conductivity using the traditional methods such as Lees' disk, the Forbes' method, or Searle's bar, it is common to use Laser Flash Analysis where a small disc of fuel is placed in a furnace. After being heated to the required temperature one side of the disc is illuminated with a laser pulse, the time required for the heat wave to flow through the disc, the density of the disc, and the thickness of the disk can then be used to calculate and determine the thermal conductivity.\n\n\nIf \"t\" is defined as the time required for the non illuminated surface to experience half its final temperature rise then.\n\n\nFor details see K. Shinzato and T. Baba (2001).\n\nAn atomic battery (also called a nuclear battery or radioisotope battery) is a device which uses the radioactive decay to generate electricity. These systems use radioisotopes that produce low energy beta particles or sometimes alpha particles of varying energies. Low energy beta particles are needed to prevent the production of high energy penetrating bremsstrahlung radiation that would require heavy shielding. Radioisotopes such as plutonium-238, curium-242, curium-244 and strontium-90 have been used. Tritium, nickel-63, promethium-147, and technetium-99 have been tested.\n\nThere are two main categories of atomic batteries: thermal and non-thermal. The non-thermal atomic batteries, which have many different designs, exploit charged alpha and beta particles. These designs include the direct charging generators, betavoltaics, the optoelectric nuclear battery, and the radioisotope piezoelectric generator. The thermal atomic batteries on the other hand, convert the heat from the radioactive decay to electricity. These designs include thermionic converter, thermophotovoltaic cells, alkali-metal thermal to electric converter, and the most common design, the radioisotope thermoelectric generator.\n\nA radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) is a simple electrical generator which converts heat into electricity from a radioisotope using an array of thermocouples.\n\nA radioisotope heater unit (RHU) typically provides about 1 watt of heat each, derived from the decay of a few grams of plutonium-238. This heat is given off continuously for several decades.\n\nTheir function is to provide highly localised heating of sensitive equipment (such as electronics in outer space). The Cassini–Huygens orbiter to Saturn contains 82 of these units (in addition to its 3 main RTGs for power generation). The Huygens probe to Titan contains 35 devices.\n\nFusion fuels include deuterium (H) and tritium (H) as well as helium-3 (He). Many other elements can be fused together, but the larger electrical charge of their nuclei means that much higher temperatures are required. Only the fusion of the lightest elements is seriously considered as a future energy source. Fusion of the lightest atom, H hydrogen, as is done in the Sun and stars, has also not been considered practical on Earth. Although the energy density of fusion fuel is even higher than fission fuel, and fusion reactions sustained for a few minutes have been achieved, utilizing fusion fuel as a net energy source remains only a theoretical possibility.\n\nDeuterium and tritium are both considered first-generation fusion fuels; they are the easiest to fuse, because the electrical charge on their nuclei is the lowest of all elements. The three most commonly cited nuclear reactions that could be used to generate energy are:\n\nSecond-generation fuels require either higher confinement temperatures or longer confinement time than those required of first-generation fusion fuels, but generate fewer neutrons. Neutrons are an unwanted byproduct of fusion reactions in an energy generation context, because they are absorbed by the walls of a fusion chamber, making them radioactive. They cannot be confined by magnetic fields, because they are not electrically charged. This group consists of deuterium and helium-3. The products are all charged particles, but there may be significant side reactions leading to the production of neutrons.\n\nThird-generation fusion fuels produce only charged particles in the primary reactions, and side reactions are relatively unimportant. Since a very small amount of neutrons is produced, there would be little induced radioactivity in the walls of the fusion chamber. This is often seen as the end goal of fusion research. He has the highest Maxwellian reactivity of any 3rd generation fusion fuel. However, there are no significant natural sources of this substance on Earth.\n\nAnother potential aneutronic fusion reaction is the proton-boron reaction:\n\nUnder reasonable assumptions, side reactions will result in about 0.1% of the fusion power being carried by neutrons. With 123 keV, the optimum temperature for this reaction is nearly ten times higher than that for the pure hydrogen reactions, the energy confinement must be 500 times better than that required for the D-T reaction, and the power density will be 2500 times lower than for D-T.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The small crocodile objects, because children taste \"nasty and bitter\" in his opinion compared to fish, and because of what happened the last time the big crocodile tried to eat children. The larger crocodile leaves the big, brown muddy river anyway, and announces his intention to Humpy Rumpy the hippopotamus, Trunky the elephant, Muggle-Wump the monkey and the Roly-Poly Bird. The animals insult him and hope that he will fail miserably and will himself be killed and eaten, after which the big crocodile briefly and unsuccessfully attacks Muggle-Wump and the Roly-Poly Bird.\n\nFirst of all, the crocodile heads to a coconut tree forest, not far away from a town and disguises himself as a small coconut tree with branches and coconuts, hoping to eat a pair of children, Toto and Mary, but is exposed by Humpy Rumpy.\n\nNext, the crocodile heads to a children's playground located outside an ancient school building and disguises himself as a see-saw, with the help of a large piece wood, hoping to eat a whole class of children, but is exposed by Muggle-Wump.\n\nThen, the crocodile heads to a funfair and, when nobody is looking, he disguises himself as a wooden crocodile on a merry-go-round by placing himself between a brown lion and a yellow dragon (with a pink-red tongue sticking out of its mouth) hoping to eat a young girl named Jill who wants to ride on him, but is exposed by the Roly-Poly Bird.\n\nLast of all, the crocodile heads to a picnic place just outside the town. When nobody is looking, the crocodile himself picks a bunch of colourful flowers and arranges it on one of the tables before (from exactly the same table), taking away one of the benches and hiding it in the bushes and then disguising himself as a long, wooden four-legged bench, hoping to eat four children who are going out on a picnic, but is exposed by Trunky.\n\nFollowing a brief confrontation, Trunky angrily wraps his trunk around the crocodile's tail, hoists him up into the air, and then, after talking to him briefly about having had enough of his clever tricks, he swings him round and round in the air by his tail, slowly and gently to start off with, and then a little faster and then a lot faster and finally very fast indeed. Eventually, Trunky lets the crocodile go, causing the fiend himself to fly through the sky, out of Earth and into space. The big crocodile whizzes past the Moon, past some stars and past all the other planets, including Mars, before finally crashing headlong into the Sun at the middle of the Solar System where he is incinerated like a sausage.\n\n\"The Enormous Crocodile\" is in the style of a picture book in contrast to Roald Dahl's other story books, illustrated by Quentin Blake. It was first published on 1 November 1978.\n\nOn the 2005 \"Four Enchanting Stories by Roald Dahl\" DVD release, the story was narrated by Roger Blake, who also provided the character voices, whilst on the accompanying VHS tape release, the story was narrated by Dave Benson Phillips and on the stand-alone Compact Disc by Stephen Fry, as well as on the accompanying \"Jackanory Junior\" episode by Sir Lenny Henry.\n\n\n"}

The star is classified as a G0Vp yellow dwarf (it has previously been classified as G3 and a subgiant [IV]). It has a mass and radius larger than the Sun, and is about 50% more luminous.\n\nIn 1999, a planet of the star was discovered. Because the planet orbits in a near Earth orbit, Iota Horologii was ranked 69th in the list of candidates for NASA's planned Terrestrial Planet Finder mission. In 2000, a dust disc was announced around the star, but this was later determined to be an instrumental artifact.\n\nSince Iota Horologii is in the minor constellation of Horologium and is quite dim in the sky, it has not been given a traditional name. It lies roughly between the stars Eta Horologii and R Horologii (though it is not close to them in real space).\n\nIn its current position, Iota Horologii is closest to the star Chi Eridani (a yellow subgiant), approximately 7 light-years away. The closest planetary systems to Iota Horologii are HD 10647 (a yellow dwarf), approximately 57 light-years away, and Epsilon Reticuli (an orange subgiant), approximately 59 light-years away. Other star systems close to Iota Horologii include Nu Phoenicis and Zeta Reticuli.\n\nSpectrographic analysis indicates the star must have formed together with the stars of the Hyades cluster (~625 million years ago) but must have slowly drifted away, being presently more than 130 light-years away from its original birthplace. The metallicity of the star matches the abundances found in the Hyades, indicating that the metals (elements heavier than helium) in the atmosphere were not acquired because it engulfed planetary material.\n\nMeasurements of magnetic activity with the 1.5 m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory show that the star has a 1.6 year magnetic activity cycle which, as of 2010, is the shortest cycle measured so far for a solar like star. The sun by comparison has an 11-year magnetic activity cycle. There may be a second, longer cycle which modulates the 1.6 year cycle.\n\n\"Iota Horologii b\" is believed to be Jupiter-sized. The planet's discovery was the result of a survey of forty stars that began in November 1992.\n\nStability analysis reveals that the orbits of Earth-sized planets located in the planet's trojan points would be stable for long periods of time.\n\nBased on residuals in the radial velocity curve, a planet in an eccentric orbit with a period of approximately 600 days was proposed, but this was not confirmed and it seems likely that the effect was due to activity on Iota Horologii itself.\n\n\n"}

Comdr. H. S. Chase, USNRF, in command.\n\nAssigned to the Naval Transportation Service, \"Salinas\" was initially in commission for only a little over six months. She was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 June 1922 and remained in reserve until recommissioned at Norfolk on 12 June 1926. The following September, she commenced carrying fuel from naval fuel depots and Caribbean and Texas oil ports to Navy bases and stations on the east and west coasts, in the Caribbean, in the Panama Canal Zone, and, in the late 1920s, to Marine Corps units in Nicaragua. Periodically interrupted for overhauls and fleet exercises; and, in 1938, for a transatlantic run to Britain, she maintained a continuous operating schedule in those areas until late in the 1930s.\n\nThen, with tension increasing in Europe, she confined her operations to runs between Gulf coast and Caribbean oil ports and bases in Cuba and on the east coast. In September 1939, World War II broke out in Europe. Hostilities soon spread across the ocean. The United States commenced neutrality patrols and escort services in the western Atlantic, and \"Salinas\", now armed, shifted her runs further north, and then east, to include bases in Canada and Iceland.\n\nDuring August 1941, the AO served as station oiler at NS Argentia, Newfoundland. She joined a convoy for Iceland in September. She arrived at Reykjavík early in October and departed that port on 23 October, in ballast, for the mid-ocean meeting point where she rendezvoused with convoy ON 28 on 25 September. From there, the tanker moved west to return to the United States. At 0700 (GCT) on the 30th, her position was 46° 56'N, 37°46'W (about east of Newfoundland) . Visibility was about .

A second torpedo followed, hitting portside at tanks 2 and 3. \"Salinas\" settled to near her loaded waterline and remained there.\n\nA submarine was sighted on the surface at 0730, close aboard on the starboard quarter. The U-boat fired three torpedoes, all misses — two ahead, one astern of the damaged oiler — then submerged. \"Salinas's\" stern gun opened fire on the disappearing U-boat, possibly hitting it. then moved in and dropped a string of depth charges on the submarine's estimated position.\n\n\"Salinas's\" crew, having suffered no serious injuries (one man was lightly wounded), began to clear the wreckage. \"Du Pont\" and stood by.

Yard work was completed at midnight on 1 April 1942. She left the repair yard on 2 April and departed New York for Chesapeake Bay on 5 April. She arrived at Norfolk on 10 April to take on cargo fuel and miscellaneous cargo; on 17 April she sailed north again. Routed first to Halifax, she joined convoy SC 81 there on 22 April, and continued on to Reykjavík on 23 April, arriving on 8 May. For the next 19 days, she fueled Allied ships in Icelandic anchorages. She moved west on 27 May and arrived at Boston, Massachusetts on 12 June. By July, she was back in Canadian waters to serve as station oiler at Argentia. She put into Sydney, Nova Scotia on 1 August to take on more cargo; on 5 August she headed for Greenland, where she supplied fueling services to units based at Kungnat Bay, Sondrestromfjord, and Tunugdliarfikfjord.

She transited the canal on 19 March, arrived at San Pedro, California on 2 April, and sailed for Alaska two days later.\n\n\"Salinas\" arrived at Dutch Harbor, Unalaska, Alaska on 17 April 1944. Routed on, she anchored in Massacre Bay, Attu and discharged her first cargo in the Aleutians on 21 April. On that run, she also delivered fuel to Kuluk Bay and Dutch Harbor. Then, in May, she headed for Seattle, whence she shuttled gasoline, oil, diesel fuel, and cargo to the Aleutians until after the end of World War II.\n\n\"Salinas\", ordered inactivated, departed Dutch Harbor for the last time in mid-October. A week later, she arrived at San Francisco where she was decommissioned on 16 January 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 26 February 1946, and she was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 1 July of the same year. It appears the \"Salinas\" was sold to the Hillcone Shipping Company. The \"Salinas\" was involved in a minor maritime accident in June 1950, when it was delivering oil to the Time Oil Company docks near the Ballard Locks. The ship ran aground in Shilshole Bay. No reported oil spill was recorded at that time, and the ship was reported taken back to San Pedro, California for repairs to its hull plates.\n\n\n"}

The first of three operas by Cornelius, the piece was first performed at the Hoftheater in Weimar on 15 December 1858.\n\nCornelius planned the work as a one-act comedy, but on the advice of Franz Liszt expanded it to two. Franz Liszt later arranged the second overture for orchestra (S.352). Unlike most German comic operas of the period, which have spoken dialogue, \"Der Barbier von Bagdad\" is through composed. Cornelius offered the inventive and complex opera as an alternative to the contemporary German opera composers such as Richard Wagner, whose ideological fervor he found overwhelming.\n\nAt its first performance the opera was a failure, and it was not played again in the composer's lifetime. The composer's mentor and friend Franz Liszt conducted the premiere. However, political actions by the director of the theater resulted in demonstrations against Liszt and the so-called neo-German school of composition. The opera closed after only one performance, and Liszt resigned his post. Cornelius also left Weimar.\n\nIn the late 19th century two versions were made, by the noted Wagnerian conductors Felix Mottl and Hermann Levi. In New York City the work was first played in 1890 by the Metropolitan Opera House Company and in London in 1891. Finally, in June 1904, the original version as composed by Cornelius was again staged in the Weimar Hoftheater, this time to popular approval and critical acclaim.\n\nIn the 20th century, the opera was performed infrequently abroad but held its own in German opera companies using the original text, rather than Mottl's or Levi's revisions. It has a minor niche in the operatic repertoire.\n\nThe hero, Nureddin, is in love with Margiana, daughter of the Cadi. Bostana, a relative of the Cadi, approving of Nureddin, helps him to woo Margiana by making himself presentable. Abdul Hassan, the barber is summoned, and like his confrère of Seville in Rossini’s earlier opera, he adopts the role of co-conspirator in the romance. (Like Rossini's Figaro, he delivers a virtuoso patter aria, \"Bin Akademiker\".)\n\nMargiana waits for Nureddin in the women's quarters of her father's house. He is proposing to marry her off to a rich friend, but when he leaves, Nureddin enters to woo Margiana. A traditional farcical plot then unfolds, with the barber breaking in, Nureddin hiding in a treasure chest and being carried away by servants, and a happy ending when the Caliph arrives and Nureddin is released and betrothed to Margiana.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

On returning to England, he boarded at St Albans School, before starting his working life in a London bank. Despite having a talent for mathematics, he said he was sacked for getting the figures right without being able to explain how he did so. As a result, he ended up selling deckchairs on the South Coast, where he eventually found acting work in repertory theatre.\n\nAfter training at RADA (1962-64), Hallam began acting with Laurence Olivier's embryonic National Theatre Company, playing the Stage Door Keeper in \"Trelawny of the 'Wells'\" (Old Vic Theatre, 1965). He was seen performing on television for the first time in 1967, in the small role of a watchman when the BBC screened the director Franco Zeffirelli's National Theatre production of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (Old Vic).\n\nStage roles became infrequent when an unending flow of film and television work followed. On the big screen, he worked his way up from bit-parts as an officer in \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (directed by Tony Richardson, 1968) and a revolting Burpa tribesman in \"Carry On Up the Khyber\" (1968) to more substantial roles as Sir Meles of Bohemia in \"A Walk with Love and Death\" (the director John Huston's tale of 14th-century romance in France, 1969).\n\nOver the years he appeared in many films including \"Where's Jack?\" (1969), \"The Last Valley\", \"Villain\", \"Nicholas and Alexandra\", \"Murphy's War\", \"Quest for Love\" (1971), \"The Offence\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\" (1972), \"Hennessy\" (1975), \"Trial by Combat\" (1976), \"The Four Feathers\" (1978), \"Love and Bullets\" (1979), \"Flash Gordon\" (1980), \"Dragonslayer\" (1981), \"Ivanhoe\" (1982), \"\" (1985), \"When the Whales Came\" (1989), and the 1985 science-fiction cult film \"Lifeforce\", directed by Tobe Hooper. He also appeared as McTaggart in the director's cut of the 1973 film \"The Wicker Man\". His later film roles included a Baron in \"\" (1991) and as Mandara in \"Kull the Conqueror\" (1997).\n\nIn 1973 he played the troubled Dr. Peter Conway in the science fiction series \"Moonbase 3\", but his most notable television role was as Thomas Mallen in the drama series \"The Mallens\" (1979). He also appeared in the BBC's television adaptations of two tales from \"The Chronicles of Narnia\": \"Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", from 1988 until 1990, and later starred as Ali Ben Hassad in the 1998 TV movie \"The Incredible Adventures of Marco Polo\". He also appeared in the show \"Blackadder\" (1983 Season 1, Episode 6: The Black Seal) as Sir Wilfred Death.\n\nHe had a semi-regular role in the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", playing prison inmate Barnsey Barnes, a character that appears as the cellmate of regular character Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) while he is serving time at the fictional Dickens Hill prison. Hallam appeared on the show between 1988 and 1989. In 1989 he appeared in the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"Ghost Light\" appearing as the memorable alien \"Light\".\n\nHallam married theatrical mask-maker Vicky Brinkworth in 1966, and they had four children together, but divorced in 1992 after twenty-six years of marriage.\n\nHallam was a cousin of actor Clive Mantle, who is best known for playing Mike Barrett in \"Casualty\" during the 1990s.\n\nOn 14 November 2006, Hallam died of testicular cancer in Clifton, Oxfordshire, England at the age of 65 after battling the illness for six months.\n\n"}

The G-sharp harmonic minor and melodic minor scales are:\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\n\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c\" {\n</score>\nIts relative major is B major. Its parallel major, G-sharp major, is usually replaced by its enharmonic equivalent of A-flat major, since G-sharp major features an F in the key signature and A-flat major only has four flats, making it rare for G-sharp major to be used. A-flat minor, its enharmonic, with seven flats, has a similar problem, thus G-sharp minor is often used as the parallel minor for A-flat major. (The same enharmonic situation occurs with the keys of D-flat major and C-sharp minor).\n\nDespite the key rarely being used in orchestral music other than to modulate, it is not entirely uncommon in keyboard music, as in Piano Sonata No. 2 by Alexander Scriabin, who actually seemed to prefer writing in it. It is also found in the second movement in Shostakovitch's 8th String quartet. If G-sharp minor is used, composers generally write B wind instruments in the enharmonic B-flat minor, rather than A-sharp minor to facilitate reading the music (or A instruments used instead, giving a transposed key of B minor). Where available, instruments in D can be used instead, giving a transposed key of the enharmonic G minor, rather than F minor, while the E horns would have parts written in the key of E minor.\n\nFew symphonies are written in G-sharp minor; among them are Nikolai Myaskovsky's 17th Symphony, Elliot Goldenthal's Symphony in G-sharp minor (2014) and an abandoned work of juvenilia by Marc Blitzstein.\n\nFrédéric Chopin composed a Polonaise in G-sharp minor, opus posthumous in 1822. His Étude No. 6 is in G-sharp minor as well.\n\nModest Mussorgsky wrote the movements \"The Old Castle\" and \"Bydło\" from \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" in G-sharp minor.\n\nLiszt's \"La campanella\" from his \"Grandes études de Paganini\" is in G-sharp minor.\n\nSibelius wrote the slow movement of his Third Symphony in G-sharp minor.\n"}

It has been superseded by JFFS2.\n\nFlash memory (specifically NOR flash) must be erased prior to writing. The erase process has several limitations:\nThese constraints combine to produce a profound asymmetry between patterns of read and write access to flash memory. In contrast, magnetic hard disk drives offer nearly symmetrical read and write access: read speed and write speed are nearly identical (as both are constrained by the rate at which the disk spins), it is possible to both read and write small blocks or sectors (typically 512 or 4096 bytes), and there is no practical limit to the number of times magnetic media can be written and rewritten.\n\nTraditional file systems, such as ext2 or FAT which were designed for use on magnetic media typically update their data structures in-place, with data structures like inodes and directories updated on-disk after every modification. This concentrated lack of wear-levelling makes conventional file systems unsuitable for read-write use on flash devices.\nJFFS enforces wear levelling by treating the flash device as a circular log. All changes to files and directories are written to the tail of the log in \"nodes\". In each node, a header containing metadata is written first, followed by file data, if any. Nodes are chained together with offset pointers in the header. Nodes start out as \"valid\" and then become \"obsolete\" when a newer version of them is created.\n\nThe free space remaining in the file system is the gap between the log's tail and its head. When this runs low, a garbage collector copies valid nodes from the head to the tail and skips obsolete ones, thus reclaiming space.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Arthur G. Somers, USNRF, in temporary command, \"Sepulga\" was decommissioned on 15 April 1922, and laid up at Mare Island for the next 18 years. She was re-commissioned on 5 February 1940, Comdr.

{"id": "2046473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046473", "title": "Elephant goad", "text": "Elephant goad\n\nThe elephant goad, bullhook, or ankus (from Sanskrit \"\" or \"ankusha\") is a tool employed by mahout in the handling and training of elephants. It consists of a hook (usually bronze or steel) which is attached to a handle, ending in a tapered end.\n\nA relief at Sanchi and a fresco at the Ajanta Caves depict a three-person crew on the war elephant, the driver with an elephant goad, what appears to be a noble warrior behind the driver and another attendant on the posterior of the elephant. \n\nNossov and Dennis (2008 p 19) report that two perfectly preserved elephant goads were recovered from an archaeological site at Taxila and are dated from 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE according to Marshall. The larger of the two is 65 cm long.\n\nNossov and Dennis (2008: p. 16) state:\n\nAn \"ankusha\", a sharpened goad with a pointed hook, was the main tool for managing an elephant. The \"ankusha\" first appeared in India in the 6th-5th century BC and has been used ever since, not only there, but wherever elephants served man. \n\nThe handle can be made of any material, from wood to ivory, depending on the wealth and opulence of the owner. Contemporary bullhooks which are used for animal handling generally have handles made of fibreglass, metal, plastic, or wood.\n\nThe elephant goad is found in armouries and temples all across India, where elephants march in religious processions and perform in various civil capacities. They are often quite ornate, being decorated with gemstones and engravings to be appropriate for the ceremonies in which they are used.\n\nThe elephant goad is a polysemic iconographic ritual tool in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, in the inclusive rubric of Dharmic Traditions.\n\nThe elephant has appeared in cultures across the world. They are a symbol of wisdom in Asian cultures and are famed for their memory and intelligence, where they are thought to be on par with cetaceans and hominids. Aristotle once said the elephant was \"the beast which passeth all others in wit and mind\". The word \"elephant\" has its origins in the Greek , meaning \"ivory\" or \"elephant\".\n\nIn iconography and ceremonial ritual tools, the elephant goad is often included in a hybridized tool, for example one that includes elements of Vajrakila, 'hooked knife' or 'skin flail' (Tibetan: gri-gug, Sanskrit: kartika), Vajra and Axe, as well as the goad functionality for example. Ritual Ankusha were often finely wrought of precious metals and even fabricated from ivory, often encrusted with jewels. In Dharmic Traditions the goad/ankusha and rope 'noose/snare/lasso' (Sanskrit: Pāśa) are traditionally paired as tools of subjugation.\n\nIn the Hinduism, an elephant goad is one of the eight auspicious objects known as Ashtamangala and certain other religions of the Indian subcontinent. A goad is also an attribute of many Hindu gods, especially Tripura Sundari & Ganesha.\n\nWallace and Goleman (2006: p. 79) discuss 'śamatha' (Sanskrit), mindfulness and introspection which they tie to metacognition:\n\nThroughout Buddhist literature, the training in shamatha is often likened to training a wild elephant, and the two primary instruments for this are the tether of mindfulness and the goad of introspection.\n\nRowlands (2001: p. 124) in discussing consciousness and its self-conscious, self-reflexive quality of apperception states that:\nThe most significant aspect of consciousness, I shall try to show, is its structure, its \"hybrid\" character. Consciousness can be both act and object of experience. Using the somewhat metaphorical notion of \"directing\", we might say that consciousness is not only the directing of awareness but \"can\" be that upon which awareness is directed. Consciousness is not only the act of conscious experience, it can be experience's object. \"[italics preserved from original]\"\nIn the above quotation the metaphor of 'directing' is employed. In 'directing' consciousness or the mind to introspectively apperceive the directive forded by the goad is key.\n\nIn the \"Tattvasamgraha tantra\" (c 7th century), one of the most important tantras of the Buddhist Yoga Tantra Class, the ankusha figures in the visualization of one of the retinue. This tantra explains the process of the visualization of the Vajradhatu Mandala, which is one of the most visually stylized of Buddhist mandalas. The Ankusha is the symbolic attribute for the visualization of the Bodhisattva Vajraraja, an emanation within the retinue of Vajradhatu. This visualization is treated in Tachikawa (c2000: p. 237).\n\nIn Rudyard Kipling's \"Second Jungle Book\" story , Mowgli finds the magnificently-jeweled elephant goad of the title in a hidden treasure chamber. Not realizing the value men place on jewels, he later casually discards it in the jungle, unwittingly leading to a chain of greed and murder amongst those who find it after him.\n\n"}

He is nicknamed \"El Bocha\". He spent his almost twenty years of his professional career at club Independiente, becoming one of the most emblematic players and the greatest idol in the history of the club.\n\nBochini won a total of 14 titles with Independiente, four Primera División championships and ten international competitions, apart from the 1986 FIFA World Cup with the Argentina national team. Bochini was a childhood idol of Diego Maradona.\n\nAs a kid, Bochini was wanted by Campana's club Villa Dálmine but started playing football for \"Belgrano\", a local club from his home city. At age of 15, he went to Buenos Aires with his father to try to join San Lorenzo de Almagro and later with Boca Juniors. He was eventually accepted for the youth system of Independiente in 1971.\n\nHe made his professional debut in the Argentine Primera División on 25 June 1972, when Independiente's coach, Pedro Dellacha sent him onto the field in the 74th minute of a match that they lost 1–0 to River Plate.\n\nBy that time Independiente had already won the 1972 Copa Libertadores, which allowed them to play the Intercontinental Cup that same year but Bochini was not part of the team that lost the tie to Ajax. He gained more participation the following year and was an important member of the team, alongside Daniel Bertoni. The team won the 1973 Copa Libertadores and the 1973 Intercontinental Cup. Bochini scored the only goal in the latter against Juventus.\n\nThe club managed to defend the Copa Libertadores title in 1974. São Paulo had won the first match of the final at Pacaembu stadium and Independiente the second one at their stadium (Bochini scored the first goal). The final had to go on a third match at the national stadium of Chile, where Ricardo Pavoni scored the only goal.\n\nIndependiente was to play the Intercontinental Cup in 1974 and 1975 against Bayern Munich but they declined both times. Atlético de Madrid, the 1973–74 European Cup's runners-up, played instead of them in 1974 and won the title. The Intercontinental Cup was not held in 1975.\nIn 1975 Bochini was conscripted into Military service and managed to also play football, but was not able to perform as well as desired. Nevertheless, he also won the 1975 Copa Libertadores with Independiente. It was Bochini's third title in a row and the club's fourth, being the only club to achieve this so far.\n\nBochini was also part of the team that won the Copa Interamericana in 1974 and 1975 against Municipal and Atlético Español respectively.\n\nAfter finishing in the second position of the Metropolitano Championship in 1977, Bochini won his first national championship with Independiente that same year. Bochini scored the last goal in the final against Talleres de Córdoba that gave them the title.\n\nBochini repeated the title with Independiente in 1978 winning the final against River Plate. After four years without any title, Independiente signed Jorge Burruchaga and José Percudani, who formed a celebrated offense with Bochini that helped the team win the 1983 Metropolitano Championship, the 1984 Copa Libertadores and the 1984 Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool.\n\nAt the end of his career Bochini won the 1988–89 Argentine Primera División being this his last title.\n\nOn 5 May 1991 Bochini played his last professional match against Estudiantes de La Plata. He played a total of 634 league matches, scoring 97 goals. He is the player with the most appearances in the Argentine Primera División after goalkeeper Hugo Gatti, who played in 775 league matches.\n\nArgentine coach César Menotti had selected Bochini several times in the 70's, but eventually he lost his place to Norberto Alonso for the 1978 FIFA World Cup.\n\nBochini played again in the national team when Carlos Bilardo succeeded Menotti as coach, but lost his place to younger players such as Diego Maradona. Nevertheless, he was part of the squad that won the 1986 FIFA World Cup but played only a few minutes in the semi-finals against Belgium replacing Jorge Burruchaga.\n\nAlthough he was not a prolific goalscorer, he was one of the best playmakers of the 1980s, often making assists for teammates to score, due to his vision and accurate passing. Even after he retired, the expression \"pase bochinesco\" (\"bochinesque pass\") is used to refer to a precise pass made to a forward to leave him one on one against the goalie, bypassing the opponent's defenders.\nBochini became a master of la pausa, the moment when a number 10, poised to deliver a pass, delays a fraction, waiting for the player he is looking to feed to reach the ideal position.\n\nIn 1991, three months after his retirement, Bochini was assigned as Independiente's manager together with Carlos Fren. The couple coached only the 1991 Apertura tournament that the team ended in the eleventh position.\n\nFifth division club Barracas Bolívar decided to include him to play a few minutes in an official match played on 27 February 2007, 16 years after his retirement, as a recognition to his career.\n\nIn November 2007 a street was named after him in the city of Avellaneda where Independiente's Stadium is located.\n\nBochini played for Independiente's veteran team in an official tournament organized by the Argentine Football Association in 2009.\n\nHe currently works as football advisor and image representative for Independiente\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The upward movement of the eye is present in the majority of the population, and is a defensive mechanism. The phenomenon is named after the Scottish anatomist, surgeon, and physiologist Charles Bell.\nBell's phenomenon is a normal defense reflex present in about 75% of the population, resulting in elevation of the globes when blinking or when threatened (e.g. when an attempt is made to touch a patient's cornea). It becomes noticeable only when the orbicularis oculi muscle becomes weak as in, for example, bilateral facial palsy associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome. It is, however, present behind forcibly closed eyelids in most healthy people and should not be regarded as a pathognomonic sign.\n\nAlso, traumatic abrasions are generally located in the central or inferior cornea due to Bell's phenomenon.\n\nBell's phenomenon does not occur during short blinks.\n\n"}
{"id": "2046511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046511", "title": "Cottrell atmosphere", "text": "Cottrell atmosphere\n\nIn materials science, the concept of the Cottrell atmosphere was introduced by A. H. Cottrell and B. A. Bilby in 1949 to explain how dislocations are pinned in some metals by boron, carbon, or nitrogen interstitials.\n\nCottrell atmospheres occur in body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) materials, such as iron or nickel, with small impurity atoms, such as boron, carbon, or nitrogen. As these interstitial atoms distort the lattice slightly, there will be an associated residual stress field surrounding the interstitial. This stress field can be relaxed by the interstitial atom diffusing towards a dislocation, which contains a small gap at its core (as it is a more open structure), see Figure 1. Once the atom has diffused into the dislocation core the atom will stay. Typically only one interstitial atom is required per lattice plane of the dislocation.\n\nOnce a dislocation has become pinned, a large force is required to unpin the dislocation prior the yielding, thus at room temperature, the dislocation will not get unpinned. This produces an observed upper yield point in a stress–strain graph. Beyond the upper yield point, the pinned dislocation will act as Frank–Read source to generate new dislocations that are not pinned. These dislocations are free to move in the crystal, which results in a subsequent lower yield point, and the material will deform in a more plastic manner.\n\nLeaving the sample to age, by holding it at room temperature for a few hours, enables the carbon atoms to rediffuse back to dislocation cores, resulting in a return of the upper yield point.\n\nCottrell atmospheres lead to formation of Lüders bands and large forces for deep drawing and forming large sheets, making them a hindrance to manufacture. Some steels are designed to remove the Cottrell atmosphere effect by removing all the interstitial atoms. Steels such as interstitial free steel are decarburized and small quantities of titanium are added to remove nitrogen.\n\nWhile the Cottrell atmosphere is a general effect, there are additional related mechanisms that occur under more specialized circumstances. \n\nThe Suzuki effect is characterized by the segregation of solutes to stacking fault defects. When dislocations in an FCC system split into two partial dislocations, a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) stacking fault is formed between the two partials. H. Suzuki predicted that the concentration of solute atoms at this boundary would differ from the bulk. Moving through this field of solute atoms would therefore produce a similar drag on dislocations as the Cottrell atmosphere. Suzuki later observed such segregation in 1961.  \n\nThe Snoek effect is characterized by the ordering of solute atoms in a dislocation stress field. In BCC metals, interstitial sites of an unstrained lattice are equally favorable. However, once a strain is applied on the lattice, such as that formed by a dislocation, 1/3 of the sites become more favorable than the other 2/3. Solute atoms will therefore move to occupy the favorable sites, forming an short ranged order of solutes immediately within the vicinity of the dislocation. More energy is therefore required to break a dislocation from this order.\n"}

Today it has 49,000 covered seats. During the World Cup 2006 the stadium was named FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hanover.\n\nThrough a sponsorship deal, the stadium's official name is currently HDI-Arena . Between 2002 and 2013 a similar arrangement saw the stadium renamed as the AWD-Arena .\n\nThe stadium was built between 1952–1954, with an original capacity of 86,000. Huge amounts of debris from the houses in Hannover destroyed during World War II were used as the foundations of the stadium, with a total construction cost of 4 million Deutschmark. The stadium officially opened on 26 September 1954.\n\nHannover 96 moved permanently to the stadium from the Eilenriedestadion in 1959. Other local clubs, such as Arminia Hannover, OSV Hannover, TSV Havelse and Sportfreunde Ricklingen have also played matches there. In addition, the stadium has hosted numerous international matches, 4 (old) league championship games (1955,57,58,61), 2 DFB Supercup finals (1991–92) and 8 DFB Cup finals (1962, 63, 65, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79).\n\nFrom 2002 to 2013 the stadium carried the name of sponsor AWD.\n\nOn 17 November 2015, the stadium was due to host an international friendly between Germany and the Netherlands. However, the match was postponed two hours before kick off following reports of a \"concrete security threat\" and \"intention to ignite explosives\". The stadium and surrounding areas were evacuated, though no explosives were found.\n\n\"All times local (CEST)\"\n\nThe stadium was one of the nine venues chosen for (West) Germany's first hosting of the World Cup. This event saw the number of seats increase to 38,000, which entailed a decrease in the overall capacity to 60,400. In addition, the upper rank of the west grandstand was completely roofed. These alterations cost 26million DM. Newly modified, the arena featured in both the first and second group phase.\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 1974:\n\nWhen Germany hosted its second international tournament, the stadium was again chosen as a venue. By now, due to the conversion of 8,000 terrace spots into single seating, the capacity stood at 55,000. It hosted two group matches:\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. However, due to FIFA sponsorship contracts, the arena had to officially be called \"FIFA World Cup Stadium Hanover\" () during the World Cup. The stadium also had to convert its standing areas into seating, thus reducing the capacity for the tournament to 43,000, before being converted back after the games.\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:\n\nAlthough the stadium has seen many changes through the years, none were as extensive and impacting as the redevelopment of 2003/04 by Schulitz & Partner Architects, which cost €65 million.\n\nThere had been much controversy within the club's fanbase over suggestions of building a new football arena for many years before. Eventually this led to the decision to preserve and comprehensively redevelop the existing stadium in 1997/98. When Germany was somewhat unexpectedly awarded the hosting of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the major stadium work was finally put into action.\n\nDuring 2003/04, major parts of the stadium were rebuilt and thus the maximum capacity was reduced to 49,951 (of which around 8,000 are standing spaces). Before 2003, the stadium had had high floodlight masts (referred to by locals as 'toothbrushes'), track and field facilities inclusive and about 60% was open plan. The redevelopments transformed it completely into a football arena and removed approximately 70% of the previous building. The roof and about 25% of the area at the outer edges of the west grandstand were demolished like the north, south and east grandstand.\n\nInstead of the previous scoreboards, the arena gained two modern video boards and replaced the old floodlight masts with 160 modern single headlights, which were integrated into the roof structure, supplying a light density of 1500 lux.\n\nThe pitch, under which a high performance drainage system and a cabin ground heating system was installed, was moved closer to the spectators than ever. With the removal of the track and field facilities, the pitch was moved directly to the west grandstand and the remaining grandstands were then built around it. This necessitated the stands behind the goals be designed in such a way that the upward gradient becomes larger gradually from west to east, creating a rather peculiar asymmetry, as the original west grandstand possessed such small angles of inclination and the new east grandstand was as constructed as steeply as possible.\n\nThe new inner roof was constructed using ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) to allow sunlight through and thus allow the grass the grow naturally, whilst also protecting all spectators from bad weather . This care for the pitch helps avoid the constant need to re-lay it as in many other roofed stadiums and was designed by Hanke Loköter who helped construction the Allianz Arena as well.\n\nThe new business and corporate packages of the AWD-Arena are just like the press area in the east grandstand. There are approximately 1,250 business seats, 29 VIP boxes for 10–12 people and 96 press places.\n\nWork on the stadium finished ahead of schedule in December 2004. The first football match held following the redevelopment was on 23 January 2005, where Hannover 96 lost 3–0 to Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga.\n\nIn June 2008, it hosted the 2008 Hannover Sevens, the European Sevens championship in rugby union.\n\nOn 15 November 2009, the stadium was filled to capacity as the funeral site for 32-year-old Hannover 96 goalkeeper Robert Enke, who took his own life on 10 November 2009.\n\nThe stadium is one of few actual stadiums to be named on FIFA 12 when it was released of 28 September 2011.\n\nAside from football, the stadium was also the scene of several German athletics championships, the German Turnfest (a sports festival), field handball finals, concerts, rugby & American football.\n\nSince the performances of The Rolling Stones & Queen in 1982, the stadium has developed into the leading open-air concert venue in Northern Germany. After the stadium underwent extensive redevelopment in 2003/04, the open air tradition was revived again with a concert by The Rolling Stones in the new arena. Madonna performed at the stadium during her Confessions Tour in August 2006 for an audience of 40,000. Other performers who held a concert at the venue include Michael Jackson in 1988 as part of his Bad World Tour, Bon Jovi in 1996 for his These Days Tour, Status Quo in 2006 and U2 in 2010 during their U2 360° Tour with Kasabian as Support Act.\n\nIn 2013, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band as well as Robbie Williams are set to give concerts for the first time at the stadium.\n\nArtists with more than two concerts at the venue:\n\n"}

He is head and sovereign of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece. Habsburg served as a Member of the European Parliament for the Austrian People's Party 1996–1999. He is known as an Pro-European and advocate for the Pan-European movement.\n\nKarl von Habsburg has long been committed to protecting the world's cultural heritage from threats such as armed conflict and natural disasters. Habsburg vigorously advocates international humanitarian law, the right of peoples to self-determination and the protection of ethnic minorities worldwide. He has been President of the cultural protection organization Blue Shield International since 2008.\n\nKarl von Habsburg was born on 11 January 1961 in Starnberg, Bavaria. He was baptised in Pöcking, Bavaria, as Archduke Karl of Austria (), the name entered in the baptismal records. At the time of his birth, his father was \"de facto\" stateless and possessed a Spanish diplomatic passport (he had grown up in Spain), while his mother was a German citizen. Like his father and siblings, he was banished from Austria for the first years of his life. However, the administrative court of Austria later ruled that applying to return to the country was legal, and his family was granted visa entrance in June 1966.\n\nHe is the oldest grandson of the last Austrian emperor and empress, Charles I and Zita of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nHis ancestral titles are Imperial Highness Archduke of Austria, Prince of Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Illyria, and Jerusalem, etc.; Grand Duke of Tuscany and Cracow, Duke of Lorraine, Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola and of the Bukovina, Grand Prince of Transylvania, Margrave of Moravia, Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia, of Modena, Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, of Auschwitz and Zator, of Teschen, Friuli, Ragusa and Zara, Princely Count of Habsburg and Tyrol, of Kyburg, Gorizia and Gradisca, Prince of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Count of Hohenems, Feldkirch, Bregenz and Sonnenberg, etc.; Lord of Trieste, Cattaro and in the Windic March, Grand Voivode of the Voivodeship of Serbia, etc., etc., etc.\n\nHe does not use his ancestor titles, because unlike most European countries, the own use of such titles is not permitted in Hungary and Austria. Habsburg, however, is often referred to and titled as Imperial Highness by inhabitants of Central Europe, especially in Hungary, Austria and Croatia. Karl von Habsburg himself is addressed worldwide (next to his names in for example Italian or Spanish) as Mr. Von Habsburg, Archduke of Austria or even from official organs especially as Imperial Highness. Habsburg himself says: \"I don't refer to titles, I'm not that vain. People use these titles out of respect for history and the role of my family in history.\"\n\nIn 1961, his father, Otto von Habsburg, renounced all claims to the Austrian throne, as a necessary legal condition to being allowed to return to Austria. On 30 November 2000, Karl's father transferred over to him the position of head and sovereign (grand master) of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece. In 2005, Karl von Habsburg filed an unsuccessful lawsuit before Austria's constitutional court after a failed attempt to have former properties of the Habsburg family returned. The family's estates had been expropriated by the First Austrian Republic; this had in part been reverted under Austrofascism, and then the Nazis had expropriated them again.\n\nAs ordered personally by Adolf Hitler, Otto von Habsburg's personal property and that of the House of Habsburg were confiscated. Otto von Habsburg, like later his son Karl, is a firm supporter of European integration and is a vehement opponent of National Socialism and Communism. Hitler hated the Habsburgs, so much so that his invasion plan of Austria was called \"Operation Otto\". \nHitler diametrically rejected the centuries-old Habsburg principles of \"live and let live\" with regard to ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages. Over 800 Habsburg resistance fighters were executed by the Nazis. Among them was Karl Burian, who was planning to blow up the Gestapo headquarters in Vienna, or Dr. Heinrich Maier, who very successfully sent Nazi armaments companies for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks or airplanes to the Allies and planned a monarchy for after the war in Central Europe.\n\nAt the express request of the USSR, which feared an opposition in its oppressed countries, the anti-Habsburg laws became mandatory international and constitutional components of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955. The family tried to get their former property returned under rules for victims of the Nazi regime. The attempt failed because the law of expropriation still has constitutional status. The Habsburg family played a leading role in the fall of the Iron Curtain.\n\nOn 1 January 2007, his father relinquished his position as the head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, a status which then devolved on Karl, and in 2008 he became the grand master of an Habsburg-Lorraine Order of St. George.\n\nKarl von Habsburg did his military service in 1981 as a Platoon commander of an Jäger (infantry) Platoon as a one-year volunteer with the Austrian Armed Forces, where he later also completed his pilot training and is currently the reserve Hauptmann (captain) in the Austrian Air Force. He is also an Austrian Army Cultural Property Protection Officer, first with the staff of the Military Command of Salzburg, later with the Armed Forces High Command, currently with IHSW at Staff College. As a paratrooper, he was elected President of the European Military Paratroopers Association (Europäischen Militär- Fallschirmsprungverbandes e.V.) in 2001 - a role that he still holds today.\n\nSince 1986, Karl von Habsburg has been president of the Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which co-organised the Pan-European Picnic (- an important event during the fall of the Iron Curtain and the Revolutions of 1989). Under his responsibility, the opposition and freedom movements in Central and Eastern Europe were supported and he participated extensively in political events in what was then Czechoslovakia, Hungary, then Yugoslavia and the Baltic States.\n\nIn May 1990, Habsburg personally led an aid convoy to Vilnius with food, medicine and clothing as a representative of the Paneuropean Union, in response to the Soviet Union's blockade of raw materials following the proclamation of Lithuanian independence in March 1990. In 1991 he organized international aid against the destruction in Dubrovnik and in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nKarl von Habsburg studied law, political science and philosophy from 1982 at the University of Salzburg and received a scholarship in 1984 for further studies at Michigan State University. He received later an LLM and MBA degree from IMADEC University in Vienna in 2012. Habsburg has been giving lectures on many topics such as European unification, legal philosophy, political and historical developments in Europe and security issues. He speaks English, French, Spanish, Italian and German.\n\nIn 1992/1993, he hosted a TV game show with Austrian public TV broadcaster ORF, called \"Who Is Who\". In October 1996, he was elected to the European Parliament for the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). Two years later, it emerged that the ÖVP's election campaign had benefitted from at least 30,000 Mark of World Vision donation money via Paneurope Austria while Karl von Habsburg sat on the board of World Vision Austria, apparently without noticing the director's dubiously legal activities. His father exacerbated the controversy when he complained that his son was being attacked unfairly and drew a parallel between the name \"Habsburg\" and a yellow badge. ÖVP did not nominate Karl von Habsburg again for the 1999 elections. In 2004, Karl von Habsburg paid 37,000 euros to the new World Vision Austria branch.\n\nOn 19 January 2002, he was appointed Director General of UNPO (Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization) by the UNPO Steering Committee.\n\nSince 7 December 2008, he is the President of the Association of National Committees of the Blue Shield. During this time, he undertook a number of fact finding missions like in Egypt, Libya, Lebanon and Mali. Habsburg does not hesitate personally to undertake dangerous operations himself, as Joris Kila, art historian for Blue Shield and \"Competence Center for Cultural Heritage\" at the University of Vienna, explains: \"Unesco and other institutions consider it too dangerous to inspect the places in Libya whether they are damaged or not, so Karl von Habsburg and I decided that we had to do it ourselves, we were in Ras-Almergib, a place right next to Leptis Magna, where a Gaddafi radar and air defense station destroyed was 15 meters from a Roman fortress that remained intact. The ancient site was on our list.\" Hapsburg was instrumental in creating a \"No Strike List\" of cultural heritage sites and cultural sites that should be preserved when attacks or flight operations were carried out. This particularly moved NATO troops to protect the cultural assets and the economic and cultural basis of the civilian population.\n\nAt a Civil-Military Assessment Mission for Malian Heritage in 2014, extensive \"no-strike lists\" with cultural goods were created. With a Blue Shield team in cooperation with the Armed Forces in Mali, Von Habsburg checked the cultural assets threatened and any relief measures. In particular, training was given by the Commander of military region 5, Colonel Kèba Sangare, Habsurg for Blue Shield and Siratigui Sogoba performed as a Cultural Heritage specialist. This also involved adapting the combat technique.\n\nIt is also about preventing the looting of historical cultural sites. Habsburg particularly supports the bringing together of military and civilian personnel and the cooperation of various international organizations for the protection of cultural assets, such as the Blue Shield, UNIFIL and UNESCO deployment in Lebanon in 2019, and the cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross in 2020.\n\nSince 2010 he has been Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Competence Center for Cultural heritage and Cultural Property Protection at the University of Vienna. He delivers lectures and training courses worldwide on the role of the military in protecting cultural property, such as at the United States Africa Command, the Civil-Military Cooperation Centre of Excellence or the Theresian Military Academy. He emphasises that it is crucial for cultural property protection to be on the spot quickly: \"We know the importance to be fast and in a place where there is a potential conflict or an actual conflict; you have to be there really fast to make an assessment and to see what you can do to immediately help.\"\n\nVon Habsburg propagates vehemently worldwide through on-site missions, lectures, workshops and interviews on the protection of archaeological finds and archaeological sites, in addition to the establishment of rules, documentation and lists, and the training of the police, the military, civil administration and international organizations, but with particular importance the strong involvement of the local population. It is only through cooperation with the locals that the protection of archaeological finds, exhibits and excavation sites from destruction, looting and robbery can be implemented sustainably. He summed it up with the words: “Without the local community and without the local participants, that would be completely impossible”.\n\nAnother of his areas of activity is the protection of intangible cultural heritage such as customs, traditions or languages. Much of what is not hewn out of stone or on paper has to be preserved for the next generations, he says. \"Today, on average, we lose one language in the world every six weeks. But 96 percent of the languages we know are more or less at risk. You have to treat them like extinct species.\"\n\nSince 2009, he has been a shareholder in a media group in the Netherlands, consisting of radio stations, a magazine and a music television channel. He is also one of the three co-founders of BG Privatinvest, a Vienna-based investment company. In December 2010 the company acquired the two most important Bulgarian daily newspapers, \"Dneven Trud\" and \"24 Chasa\". After ongoing conflicts with Bulgarian partners, BG Privatinvest sold the newspapers in April 2011.\n\nAs head of the family, Habsburg undertakes numerous commitments. On the one hand, these are cultural, historical, scientific, political, but also tourist events and, on the other hand, commitments to orders of chivalry, associations or military units. Many events, such as the participation in the peace flight in 2018 as a pilot with his plane, concerned the centenary of World War I. In 2019 there were many events in honor of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. He is supported in this work by an \nadjutant general or adjutant.\n\nHabsburg has lived in Salzburg, Austria, since 1981, and resides in \"Casa Austria\", formerly called \"Villa Swoboda\", in Anif, near the city of Salzburg. On 31 January 1993 in Mariazell, he married Baroness Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza (born 7 June 1958 in Lausanne), the only daughter of Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza de Kászon, a European industrialist, and his third wife, the fashion model Fiona Frances Elaine Campbell-Walter. The marriage received the dynastic authorization of Karl's father, as head of the House of Habsburg, despite objections from some members of the family inasmuch as the bride, although a baroness in the nobility of pre-republican Hungary and Transylvania, did not descend in the canonically legitimate male line from a family of dynastic (ruling or formerly ruling or mediatised) status, as does his younger brother Georg's wife.\n\nIn July 1998 an Austrian court fined Karl von Habsburg 180,000 schillings ($14,300); he had failed to declare immediately to customs officials that he had an antique diadem in his luggage when he crossed the border from Switzerland in July 1996. The diadem belonged to his wife who intended to wear it at a wedding ceremony. After 10 years of marriage, the couple separated in 2003.\n\nKarl and Francesca have three children:\n\nHabsburg said in an interview about private life in the 21st century: \"If you don't deliver results, you won't get any further. There are no inherited laurels to rest on. And I don't see anyone in my family who has a problem with that.\" Regarding the racing profession of his son Ferdinand: \"I'm pretty relaxed now. When I think about how often I took him to the hospital with broken bones after a kart race!\"\n\nIn March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he tested positive for the virus. Habsburg said he felt good and fearless and was self-isolated at home. He was the first royal person and head of a royal house to contract the virus. Habsburg was officially declared healthy after almost three weeks of quarantine. \"However, the situation makes it necessary to stay at home. It is the best way to curb the spread of the virus,\" he said. \"One must now bear responsibility in freedom, to take care of ourselves and thus of our fellow human beings\". After his illness, Karl von Habsburg encouraged everyone to follow the official protective measures strictly, and asked survivors of the disease to donate blood plasma.\n\n\nHis as Grand Master not currently activated Orders of chivalry of his ancestral are the Military Order of Maria Theresa, the Order of Leopold, the Order of the Iron Crown and the Order of Franz Joseph.\n\n"}

The phrase implies that money is a kind of deity.\n\nAlthough the phrase \"almighty dollar\" was not popularized until the 1900s, similar phrases were used much earlier. For example, British writer Ben Jonson wrote in 1616:\nThe \"dollar\" version of the phrase is commonly attributed to Washington Irving, who used it in the story \"The Creole Village\", which was first published in the 1837 edition of \"The Magnolia\", a literary annual.\n\nCharles Dickens used the phrase in Chapter III, \"Boston\", of his \"American Notes\", published in 1842.\n\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton is often credited with coining the related phrase \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\", which he used in his 1871 novel \"The Coming Race\". More obscure uses of the phrase can be found as far back as 1852.\n\n\"The Almighty Dollar\" is the name of an Ozzy Osbourne song (2007) from the album \"Black Rain\". The song argues that money and greed are destroying the planet by blinding people to problems such as global warming and pollution.\n\n\"Almighty Dollar\" is the name of a Devin the Dude song from the 2007 album \"Waitin' to Inhale\". It is a lament both of a marijuana user's lack of money and the declining buying power of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe words \"Almighty Dollar\" are repeated in the 1973 funk hit single \"For the Love of Money\" by The O'Jays. The song cautions against the intense desire for money and the negative effects such desire can have on a person's personality and actions.\n\nThe phrase \"Almighty Dollar\" is repeated many times in the song \"Money (In God We Trust)\" by the funk metal band Extreme.\n"}

Object Desktop 1.0 was followed by 1.5 and \"Professional\" versions following in short order.\n\nBy 1997 the OS/2 ISV market was flagging, and many customers were switching to Windows NT 4. 1997 OS/2 revenues were 33% of those in 1996, and they fell to 25% of 1996 levels in 1998. This led to their decision to switch to Windows in mid-1997. Nevertheless, Stardock remained an OS/2 ISV until February 2001, when they stopped selling Object Desktop for OS/2.\n\nOS/2 versions were sold as initial versions and upgrades, costing more than later Windows versions due to lower volume of sales.\n\nThe initial release of Object Desktop was both praised for its functionality and criticised for performance and compatibility issues.\n\n\"Object Desktop 1.5\" was released on 2 May 1996, fixing many problems, and adding the following components:\n\nUsers of 1.0 could upgrade for $37.\n\n\"Object Desktop Professional\" was (as the name suggests) aimed at professional users of OS/2. It was released on 24 August 1996, priced at $179; users could also upgrade from OD 1.5 for $69.95, or from OD 1.0 for $119.\n\nIn addition to the features of OD 1.5, the package included:\n\n\"Object Desktop 2.0\" was an update to all previously released components, and an integration of the Professional features into the main package. It was priced at $99.95; users of Object Desktop Professional could upgrade for $39, while other versions could be upgraded for $69.95.\n\nAn upgrade to 2.02 was released at the start of 2000, but it was made clear that it would be the last release.\n\nWhen it became clear that OS/2 would not remain a viable platform, Stardock decided to move to Windows. This required rewriting old components and writing new ones to replace those which were not appropriate for Windows. This would take time, but Stardock needed money immediately to sustain development.\n\nTo cope with this cashflow problem, Object Desktop users who had switched from OS/2 to Windows were asked to purchase Windows subscriptions in advance of the actual software, on the understanding that their subscription period would only begin when the software was reasonably complete (which ended up as December 1999). This program was called the \"Early Experience Program\". Due to significant goodwill built up over the previous years, many signed up, and Stardock survived.\n\nInitially the new Object Desktop package was closely related to the OS/2 versions, with old favourites like \"Object Edit\", \"Control Center\" and \"Task/Tab Launchpad\" being ported over. However, as the userbase expanded from its traditional core of technical users into the wider Windows market, newer components shifted to focus on customizing the graphical user interface. The flagship component of Object Desktop became \"WindowBlinds\"; other popular additions were \"IconPackager\", \"ObjectBar\", \"DesktopX\", \"DeskScapes\" and \"Fences\".\n\n\"Impulse\" (preceded by \"Component Manager\" and \"Stardock Central\") is the main interface for registering, downloading and updating components. It is roughly equivalent to a package manager.\n\nUsers pay an initial fee for access to the software and one year of access to download updates. They may also download new components added during their subscription period. Updates are not guaranteed; components deemed less relevant may be passed over, or removed.\n\nAfter expiry, users cannot download any software until they renew; however, they do not lose the use of released (non-beta) software that is already downloaded, nor is it necessary to renew immediately. Renewals add a year of access from the date of renewal, not the expiry date.\n\nHistorically, the initial subscription fee for the Windows version of Object Desktop has been $49.95, while a year's renewal or an upgrade from a standalone component has been $34.95. Object Desktop 2008 introduced two tiers, with the lower tier at $49.95 and the higher tier at $69.95, but the latter was eliminated in 2010.\n\nObject Desktop works on a component model; many of its programs are available separately, but subscribers can use all of them.\n\nThese components are available to all Object Desktop subscribers as of February 2010:\n\nThese components may remain available for some legacy subscribers, but are not offered to new users:\n\nThese components have been withdrawn from service or did not make it past the beta stages:\n\nThese components were not brought forth to the Windows version of Object Desktop:\n\nAn occasional complaint with the subscription model is that a subscriber's favourite component has not been updated recently, or may be left in beta for a long time. On the other hand, popular components such as \"WindowBlinds\" tend to be frequently updated, with beta releases every week or two, release versions with new features every few months, and major version changes every year or so.\n\nSome non-Object Desktop users have said the beta issue creates a double standard and forces people to upgrade to Object Desktop in order to get the latest features, while Stardock says that the policy is due to too many standalone users expecting beta versions to have the same reliability as release versions, and the increased ease of releasing a build on Impulse over a separate installation package.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2046574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046574", "title": "The Ghosts of Versailles", "text": "The Ghosts of Versailles\n\nThe Ghosts of Versailles is an opera in two acts, with music by John Corigliano to an English libretto by William M. Hoffman. The Metropolitan Opera had commissioned the work from Corigliano in 1980 in celebration of its 100th anniversary, with the premiere scheduled for 1983. Corigliano and Hoffman took as the starting point for the opera the play \"La Mère coupable\" (\"The Guilty Mother\") by Pierre Beaumarchais. They took seven years to complete the opera, past the initial deadline. The opera received its premiere on December 19, 1991, at the Metropolitan Opera, with the production directed by Colin Graham. The premiere run of seven performances was sold out. The original cast included Teresa Stratas, Håkan Hagegård, Renée Fleming, Graham Clark, Gino Quilico, and Marilyn Horne. The Metropolitan Opera revived the opera in the 1994/1995 season.\n\nCorigliano considers this work a \"grand opera buffa\" because it incorporates both elements of the grand opera style (large chorus numbers, special effects) and the silliness of the opera buffa style. Commentators have noted how the opera satirises and parodies accepted operatic conventions.\n\nLyric Opera of Chicago staged the opera in the 1995/1996 season in the first performances outside of the Metropolitan Opera, in a lightly revised version that cut some expensive aspects of the Met's production, including an onstage orchestra.\n\nIn 2008, on Corigliano's recommendation, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis (OTSL) and Wexford Festival Opera in Ireland engaged composer John David Earnest to rework the score for chamber orchestra to make it suitable for performances in small houses. The world and European première performances of this version took place the following year with co-productions at OTSL and Wexford Festival Opera respectively.\n\nThe opera was supposed to be revived at the Metropolitan Opera in 2010. General Manager Peter Gelb had already invited Kristin Chenoweth to play the part of Samira. However, the production was canceled in 2008 because the weakened US economy at the times required the cutting of costs instead of launching an expensive production like this.\n\nThe work was given its West Coast premiere in 2015 at Los Angeles Opera in a full-scale production starring Patricia Racette and Patti LuPone, conducted by James Conlon. The chamber version was part of the Wolf Trap Opera Company's 2015 season. The work was performed by the Miami Music Festival as part of their Summer 2018 season.\n\nIn December 2019, the work had its premiere at the Opera at Versailles.\n\nThe opera is set in an afterlife existence of the Versailles court of Louis XVI. In order to cheer up the ghost of Marie Antoinette, who is upset about having been beheaded, the ghost of the playwright Beaumarchais stages an opera (obviously based on \"La Mère coupable\", although described by Beaumarchais as a new composition) using the characters and situations from his first two Figaro plays.\n\nIn this new opera-within-an-opera, Count Almaviva is in Paris as ambassador from Spain. Together with his trusty manservant Figaro, he tries to rescue Marie Antoinette from the French Revolution. When things go awry, Beaumarchais himself enters the opera and – with the invaluable help of Figaro and his wife Susanna – attempts to rescue the queen.\n\nThe ghosts of the court of Louis XVI arrive at the theatre of Versailles. Bored and listless, even the King is uninterested when Beaumarchais arrives and declares his love for the Queen. As Marie Antoinette is too haunted by her execution to reciprocate his love, Beaumarchais announces his intention to change her fate through the plot of his new opera \"A Figaro for Antonia\".\n\nThe cast of the opera-within-the-opera is introduced. It is twenty years after the events of \"The Marriage of Figaro\". Figaro appears, chased by his wife Susanna, his employer Count Almaviva, his many creditors and quite a lot of women claiming he is the father of their children. Figaro, now aging but still as wily and clever as ever, lists his many achievements in a lengthy aria. Meanwhile, Count Almaviva is engaged in a secret plan to sell Marie Antoinette's jeweled necklace to the English ambassador to buy the Queen's freedom. The Count, Beaumarchais explains, is estranged from his wife Rosina due to her affair, years earlier with Cherubino. Though Cherubino is now dead, Rosina bore him a son, Léon. Léon wants to marry Florestine, Almaviva's illegitimate daughter (by a lady of the Court well-known to Marie Antoinette, according to Beaumarchais), but the Count has forbidden the union as retribution for his wife's infidelity and has promised Florestine instead to his friend Patrick Honoré Bégearss.\n\nFigaro and Susanna enrage the Count by warning him that the trusted Bégearss is in fact a revolutionary spy. Figaro is fired, but overhears Bégearss and his dimwitted servant Wilhelm hatching a plot to arrest the Count that evening at the Turkish embassy when he sells the Queen's necklace to the English ambassador.\n\nThe Queen is still depressed, and Beaumarchais explains his intentions: Figaro will thwart the villains, the young lovers will be allowed to marry, and she herself will be freed and put on a ship bound for the New World, where he, Beaumarchais, will be waiting to entertain her. The King takes offense at this.\n\nThe Countess pleads with the Count on Léon's and Florestine's behalf, \"aided\" hypocritically (and therefore uselessly) by Bégearss, but the Count spurns her. Beaumarchais then enchants the Queen with a flashback, twenty years earlier, to Rosina's affair with Cherubino. In a beautiful garden, the lovers sing a rapturous duet, echoed by Beaumarchais and Marie Antoinette, who nearly kiss. They are interrupted by the King, who, enraged, challenges Beaumarchais to a duel. After a brief bit of swordplay, the King runs Beaumarchais through, but the wound has no effect because they are all already dead. The Ghosts find this hilarious, and have great fun stabbing each other.\n\nBeaumarchais changes the scene to the Turkish embassy, to a wild party thrown by the Turkish ambassador Suleyman Pasha. Bégearss readies his men to arrest the Count, but Figaro intercepts the plot by infiltrating the party dressed as a dancing girl. During the outrageous performance of the Turkish singer Samira, Figaro steals the necklace from the Count before the sale can take place and runs away, hotly pursued by everybody else.\n\nBeaumarchais sets up the beginning of the second act. Figaro returns, but to Beaumarchais' shock and the amusement of the Ghosts defies Beaumarchais's intention that he return the necklace to the queen, as he wants to sell it to help the Almavivas escape. To put the story back on course and despite the danger to himself, Beaumarchais enters the opera and shocks Figaro into submission by forcing him to witness the unfair trial of Marie.\n\nThe Count, swayed by his wife's wishes, rescinds his offer to Bégearss of his daughter's hand. Even though Figaro gives him the necklace, Bégearss is enraged and sends the Spaniards to the prison where Marie Antoinette lingers. Because of his entering the opera, Beaumarchais' powers are gone and he is weakened and unable to prevent the arrest, but he and Figaro manage to escape.\n\nIn prison, the Count realizes his foolishness and becomes reconciled with his wife, Florestine and Léon. Beaumarchais and Figaro arrive at the prison to try to rescue the Almavivas, but it is the Countess, Susanna and Florestine who come up with a plan: using their feminine wiles on poor Wilhelm, who is their jailer, they steal his keys, unlock their cell and, after locking him inside, attempt to flee. Bégearss and soldiers appear to prevent their escape with the Queen, and Bégearss viciously announces that Wilhelm will be executed as well for his failure. Figaro denounces Bégearss to the revolutionaries, revealing that he has kept the necklace rather than using it to feed the poor, and is backed up by Wilhelm. Bégearss is arrested as a traitor to the Revolution and dragged off, the Almavivas leave and Beaumarchais, after bidding a fond farewell to his favorite creation (i.e. Figaro), is left with the keys to the Queen's cell and proceeds to complete his plan. But the Queen refuses to let Beaumarchais alter the course of history; the power of his love has helped her to accept her fate and he has, in fact, freed her from her own fear and grief which have kept her as a ghost on Earth and she is now free to declare her own love for Beaumarchais. Events proceed: the Queen is executed; Figaro, Susanna and the Almavivas escape to America; and Marie Antoinette and Beaumarchais are united in Paradise.\n\nIn 2015, Richard S. Ginell of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that “many still differ as to whether ‘Ghosts’ has lived up to the hype and expense of its 1991 premiere at the Metropolitan Opera. But I love it, and I think it has a shot at immortality. It’s comic and serious, entertaining and erudite, silly and thoughtful, emotional and mysterious, harrowing and uplifting, intimate and over-the-top – and the more times you see it, the more you’ll find in it and the more you’ll get out of it.”\n\nUp until recently, the only recordings were a VHS of a televised production presented by the Metropolitan Opera in 1992 and a Constant Linear Velocity (CLV) LaserDisc of the same performance. The LaserDisc, published by Deutsche Grammophon, also includes a monochrome printed libretto. The LaserDisc version of the opera provides a digital sound track plus enhanced video resolution over the VHS recording. Graham Clark was nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance as Bégearss in this video. This recording was re-released on DVD on September 21, 2010, as part of the James Levine 40th anniversary DVD box set. It, like the other DVDs in the set, is now available separately.\n\nIn April 2016, an audio recording of the Los Angeles Opera's 2015 production was released by Pentatone (PTC 5186538, a 2-SACD album). It won the 2017 Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Classical and for Best Opera Recording.\n\n"}

The Star Prophecy appears in the Qumran texts called the Dead Sea scrolls. \"This was the prophecy that was of such importance to all resistance groups in this period, including those responsible for the documents at Qumran and the revolutionaries who triggered the war against Rome, not to mention the early Christians\".\n\nThe Star Prophecy was applied to the coming Messiah himself in contemporary radical Jewish documents, such as the apocalyptic \"War Scroll\" found at Qumran. In a \"pesher\" applied to the text from \"Numbers\", the War Scroll's writer gives the following exegesis:\n…by the hand of the Poor whom you have redeemed by Your Power and the peace of Your Mighty Wonders… by the hand of the Poor and those bent in the dust, You will deliver the enemies of all the lands and humble the mighty of the peoples to bring upon their heads the reward of the Wicked and justify the Judgement of Your Truth on all the sons of men.\n\nSome have speculated that the Romanized Jewish historian Josephus, applied the prophecy to Vespasian, who was campaigning against the Jewish Zealots in Palestine, and \"who was to come out of Palestine and rule the world.\" According to Robert Karl Gnuse, it is not certain that Josephus was referring to the Star Prophecy:\nThe star has been externalized as an actual star in the sky, the Star of Bethlehem, in the narration of the Gospel of Matthew. The fulfilled Star Prophecy is one of numerous instances of the asserted fulfillment of prophecies that are a main theme of this text.\n\nThe prophecy was also applied to Simon bar Kokhba, messianic leader of the Second Jewish Revolt of 132, whose adopted name \"bar Kokhba\" means \"Son of a Star\" in Aramaic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2046576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046576", "title": "De Magnete", "text": "De Magnete\n\nDe Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (\"On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth\") is a scientific work published in 1600 by the English physician and scientist William Gilbert and his partner Aaron Dowling. A highly influential and successful book, it exerted an immediate influence on many contemporary writers, including Francis Godwin and Mark Ridley.\n\nIn his work, Gilbert described many of his experiments with his model Earth called the \"terrella\". (Previously, it was thought that Polaris or a large magnetic island at the North Pole attracted the compass). Gilbert also made the claim that gravity was due to the same force and he believed that this held the Moon in orbit around the Earth. While incorrect by modern standards, this claim was still far closer to what we believe than the ancient Aristotelian theory, which held that the heavenly bodies consist of a special fifth element which naturally moves in circles, while the earthly elements naturally move downward. Johannes Kepler accepted Gilbert's theory and used it as a working basis for his famous laws of planetary motion.\n\nIn \"De Magnete\", Gilbert also studied static electricity produced by amber. Amber is called \"elektron\" in Greek, and \"electrum\" in Latin, so Gilbert decided to refer to the phenomenon by the adjective \"electricus\", giving rise to the modern terms \"electric\" and \"electricity\".\n\n\"De Magnete\" was influential because of the inherent interest of its subject matter, but also for the rigorous way in which Gilbert described his experiments and his rejection of ancient theories of magnetism. Gilbert nevertheless acknowledged his debt to Peter of Maricourt and incorporated this 13th-century scientist's experiments on magnetism into his own treatise. Although Gilbert's thinking was influenced by the mysticism of his time he is regarded as a pioneer of experimental science.\n\n\"De Magnete\" consists of six books.\n\nHistorical survey of magnetism and theory of Earth's magnetism. The loadstone in antiquity from Plato onwards and the gradual identification of iron ores. The south pole of a loadstone points to the north pole of the Earth and vice versa as the terrestrial globe is magnetic.\n\n Distinction between electricity and magnetism. An amber stick when rubbed affects a rotating needle made of any type of metal (a versorium) and attracts paper, leaves and even water. But electricity is different from heat and to magnetism which only attracts iron-bearing materials (he calls it coition). He shows the effects of cutting a spherical loadstone (which he calls a \"terrella\") through the poles and equator and the direction of attraction at different points. Magnets act at a distance but the force has no permanent presence and is not hindered like light. Materials including gold, silver and diamonds are not affected by magnets, nor can one produce perpetual motion.\n\n The Earth's normal magnetism. He proposes (incorrectly) that the angle of the ecliptic and precession of the equinoxes are caused by magnetism. A loadstone cut out of rock and floated in water returns to the same direction. Iron heated to white heat and cooled lying along a meridian also acquires magnetism. But stroking with other materials fails—he proved this with an experiment with 75 diamonds in front of witnesses. The best way to magnetize a compass (magnetized versorium).\n\nDeclination. The compass does not always point to true north. There is considerable variation. Using the terrella he shows that variations in the height of the surface can lead to differences but insists that variation is a global issue. In the midst of the ocean or continent there is no variation. He shows how to measure variation and the sources of common errors.\n\n Magnetic dip. The angle of inclination (dip) of a compass to the horizon differs according to latitude. He shows how to construct a dip instrument. At the equator it is level and increases towards the poles as he has shown earlier with his terrella.\n\nTerrestrial rotation. Heraclides and others held that the Earth rotates from west to east and this is supported by Copernicus (the \"restorer of astronomy\"), but Aristotle said otherwise. \"If the rotations of the earth seems headlong and not to be permitted by nature because of its rapidity, then worse than insane, both as regards itself and the whole universe is the motion of the primum mobile.\" He rejects the idea of a sphere of the fixed stars for which no proof has been offered and leaves aside the question of other movements of the Earth but \"infers not with mere probability, but with certainty the diurnal revolution of the earth.\" He states that \"the cause of the diurnal motion are to be found in the magnetic energy and the alliance of bodies\" but offers no further guidance. The inclination of the Earth's pole to the ecliptic produces the seasons. He explains the Precession of the equinoxes as the movement of the Earth's axis.\n\nIn Chapter III, Gilbert argues in favor of the Copernican System. He posits that due to the inordinate distance of the celestial spheres, if in fact the spheres exist at all, it is an absurd idea that they would rotate every 24 hours, as opposed to the rotation of the relatively tiny sphere of the Earth. He states, \"How far away from the earth are those remotest of stars: they are beyond the reach of eye, or man's devices, or man's thought. What an absurdity is this motion (of spheres)\". He also argues for the extreme variability of the distance to the various heavenly bodies and states that situated \"in thinnest aether, or in the most subtle fifth essence, or in vacuity – how shall the stars keep their places in the mighty swirl of these enormous spheres composed of a substance of which no one knows aught?\".\n\n\n"}

Altrincham is the nearest town. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 286.\n\nWarburton has a history of settlement stretching back to the 11th century, with the possibility of earlier habitation. There are 17 listed buildings in the village, including the timber framed Grade I Church of St Werburgh, which is at least 700 years old. Among the other listed buildings are examples of architect John Douglas' work, including the second Church of St Werburgh, built in 1883. In 2006, \"Time Team\" excavated in the lands of Moss Brow Farm in Warburton, looking for a Roman fortlet.\n\nSome limited evidence has been found of activity on the site of Warburton dating from the Bronze Age, through the Iron Age and Roman periods; these include a flint blade, six Mesolithic tools, pieces of quernstone, and a snake bracelet. Archaeological evidence indicates that the area around Warburton has been used agriculturally since at least the Roman times. In the Domesday Book, the name was \"Warburgtune\" which name has evolved to today's 'Warburton'. The suffix \"–ton\" means a settlement or farmstead in Old English, indicating that the settlement has pre-Conquest origins. It has been suggested that Warburton was the site of an Anglo-Saxon \"burgh\" or defended settlement, possibly either called \"Toppingburgh\" or\"Weard byrig\", established by Aethelflaed, Queen of the Mercians, in 915 during the wars with the Vikings. However, it now seems likely that site lay on the Wales–Cheshire border.\n\nThe first documented reference to Warburton occurs in the Domesday Book, where the two manors of Warburton were recorded; the manors were united by the late 12th century. Before the Norman conquest, the area was controlled by the Anglo-Saxon thegn Aelfward. Although the Domesday Book records no church in Warburton, it is possible that the church dedicated to Saint Werburgh is pre-Conquest. The omission of the church may not be significant, as not all pre-Conquest churches or chapels were recorded in the Domesday survey. The first documented evidence of a church in Warburton was in a deed of 1187, when it was a chapel of ease for the parish of Lymm. Warburton became a separate parish in the 13th century. The church is surrounded by a ditch and bank, probably dating to at least the 14th century. Warburton is also the site of a medieval priory, near the Church of St Werburgh; although the priory was only formed in the 13th century, it was dissolved in 1270.\n\nWarburton was predominantly a farming village during the medieval period. The north western corner of the township was used as a deer park. Warburton grew as an agricultural town during the medieval period, and it remained almost untouched by the Industrial Revolution; this is reflected in the population change between 1801 and 1901, dropping from 466 to 403, with little variation at a time when the rest of Trafford was expanding rapidly.\n\nThe civil parish of Warburton was created in 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894 and has its own parish council. Warburton became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in 1974 upon the borough's creation, but was previously in Bucklow Rural District. The village is part of the Bowdon electoral ward; as of the 2012 local elections the councillors for the Bowdon ward are all Conservative. Warburton lies in the Altrincham and Sale West constituency, which since its formation in 1997 has been represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady.\n\nThe village of Lymm lies to the south west of Warburton in the borough of Warrington, with the River Bollin forming the border between the two villages. The Bollin joins the River Mersey in the village; however the Mersey in Warburton has dried up, as it was diverted into the Manchester Ship Canal further upstream. To the east lie Dunham Town, Dunham Massey, Bowdon and Altrincham, with Little Bollington to the south, and Partington and Urmston to the north. The local geology is lower keuper marl, with a ridge of sand and gravel running from Warburton to Dunham.\n\nThe main roads running through Warburton are the A6144 and B5159. A local bus service, 5 (operated by Warrington Borough Transport) links Warburton with Warrington and Altrincham. Formerly, the 38 (operated by Warrington Coachways) also used to serve the village.\n\nAt the 2001 UK census, Warburton had a total population of 286. For every 100 females, there were 121.7 males. The average household size was 2.44. Of those aged 16–74 in Warburton, 43.2% had no academic qualifications or one GCSE, similar to the figures for all of Trafford (40.8%) and in England (45.5%). According to the census, 1.40% were unemployed and 33.49% were economically inactive. 16.43% of the population were under the age of 16 and 6.64% were aged 75 and over; the mean age of the people of Warburton was 43.03. 69.34% of residents described their health as 'good'.\n\nWarburton has two churches of note. St Werburgh's () is a timber framed church and a Grade I Listed Building, one of six in Trafford. Of the 29 timber framed churches that survive in England and Wales, St Werbugh's is one of the oldest. The church dates to at least the 14th century, and may be built on the site of an earlier Saxon chapel. It is rarely used for worship but is accessible to visitors. The church features an early-17th-century font, a Jacobean pulpit, and a 1645 altar. Nearby are the remains of the old village cross, complete with stocks whose wooden restraints are modern, though the supporting pillars are much older. The other church in Warburton, also dedicated to St Werburgh, was built in 1883 by John Douglas and is a Grade II Listed Building. The church is made of red sandstone with a clay tile roof.\n\nAs well as the two churches dedicated to Saint Werburgh, there are 15 other Grade II listed buildings. The parish rooms and caretaker's house were built in 1889, and designed by John Douglas. Also built in the village by Douglas was the post office in 1893, and Warburton School in 1871–72; this has been converted to a residence but still features crucks supporting the roof. Some farm buildings in Warburton are also listed, including the farmhouse on Moss Lane. The barn is 18th-century but features crucks which may be 17th-century or earlier. The timber framed farm building on Park Road is 17th-century in origin; the late-18th-century farmhouse on Warburton Lane was made with Flemish bond brick and has a slate roof. The barn on Paddock Lane dates from the 17th century. Also on Paddock Lane are two farmhouses: one was built in 1717 by Thomas Egerton and features an inglenook fireplace; the other is Wigsey Farmhouse which was originally built in the 17th century with later additions, including a 19th-century porch. The building on Warburton Lane near Villa Farmhouse was originally a timber framed building from the 16th or early 17th century. The house features late-16th- or early-17th-century frescos of a woman, possibly St Werburgh, with two geese and a rose.\n\nThere is the base of a stone cross on Townfield Lane, and wooden stocks nearby, probably dating from the 17th century. One of the more unusual listed structures in Warburton is the 25 m stretch of wall constructed from flagstones, probably built in the 18th or 19th century. There are two listed structures in the grounds of the old Church of St Werburgh: a lychgate from the late 19th century, and a sundial from 1765.\n\nWarburton Bridge is a privately owned statutory tolled undertaking which incorporates a public highway road length. The high-level cantilever bridge crosses the Manchester Ship Canal on the B5159 road, connecting the A57 with the A6144, and was commissioned under the Rixton & Warburton Bridge Act 1863. The original stone bridge spanned the River Mersey prior to its later diversion into the Manchester Ship Canal. Both bridges and the unadopted approach roads are privately maintained. It is one of the few remaining pre-motorway toll bridges in the United Kingdom, and the only one in Greater Manchester.\n\nSince 1998, archaeological techniques such as field walking have led to the discovery of finds ranging in age from prehistoric flints and Bronze Age axe heads to Roman and late medieval finds. Featuring prominently amongst these finds were Roman artefacts including coins, brooches and a snake bracelet. At the invitation of local historian Jim Balme, \"Time Team\" excavated in Warburton in September 2006. They were searching for a Roman fortlet that previous archaeological digs by South Trafford Archaeological Group (STAG) indicated might be present. Though no evidence of a Roman fortlet was found, the discovery of strip lynchets indicates that there was a Romano-British farm in Warburton. The presence of Roman finds was explained as rubbish, mixed in with manure to be spread on the crops.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

McKinney Transportation Center or the Stamford Transportation Center, is a major railroad station in the city of Stamford, Connecticut, serving passengers traveling on Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, and Shore Line East. In addition, it is also a major bus terminal for Greyhound, Peter Pan, and CTtransit buses. Annual ridership on Metro-North exceeded 8.4 million in 2016, making it the second busiest station in the entire system, after Grand Central Terminal.\n\nJust northeast of the station is the split for the New Canaan Branch. A few Shore Line East trains terminate at Stamford during the morning rush hour, and originate there in the evening, though this service was service suspended indefinitely on March 16, 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUnited Airlines codeshares with Amtrak to provide service out of Stamford station to the train station at United's Northeast hub, Newark Liberty International Airport. As such, the train station has the IATA airport code (as an IATA-indexed train station) ZTF.\n\nDowntown Stamford is directly north of the station, while the South End is directly south.\n\nRegular daily train service began in Stamford on January 1, 1849. In 1867, a depot was built one block east of the present location. The railroad at that time consisted of two tracks and passed through town on ground level (crossing the streets at grade). In the mid-1890s two more tracks were added to the line and most crossings were elevated and bridged, so the 1867 depot, was razed and replaced.\n\nIn 1987, the New York Times published a review of the then-new Stamford Transportation Center by architecture critic Paul Goldberger. The station was criticized for \"a harshness almost unequaled in contemporary architecture\" as well as for cost overruns and many functional failings, including the lack of shelter for the track platforms. The route from the cross-tracks waiting room to the platform was so long and indirect that passengers who waited indoors until a train's arrival was announced could not get to the platform in time to board it.\n\nA complete renovation of the station in the early 2000s, provided for in the original design of the overhead structure, addressed these problems. The two platforms were made island platforms, capable of serving four tracks. Added features included platform canopies, stairs and escalators directly from the waiting room for the tracks, and a new platform crossover, connecting to the parking garage.\n\nThis station has two a 9-car-long side platform on the south side, a 10-car-long platform on the north side and two high-level 12-car-long island platforms. The main station concourse straddles the tracks of the Northeast Corridor, and contains the ticket booth, a passenger waiting area, and shops. Below the platform level is an MTA police station, other shops, a Greyhound/Peter Pan office and CT Transit Customer Information Center. Stairs and escalators lead to the platform level. On the south side of the station, across an access street, is a large parking garage connected to the concourse by one pedestrian bridge and directly connected to the east end of the platforms by a second bridge (both bridges connect to Level 4 of the garage).\n\nA bus station is located just to the north of the train station, underneath a large bridge carrying Interstate 95. Taxis, often lined up by the dozens, pick up passengers at a stand on the south side of the station. A car rental agency is located southwest of the station building.\n\nMultiple parking garages are within the area, including a garage that is open 24/7 and is linked by air-bridge to the upper level of the train station.\n\nIn 2012 it was announced by the Connecticut Dept of Transportation that the old parking garage would be demolished. An RFP was issued seeking developers' ideas for what to construct on the site of the old garage with the possibility that replacement parking (for 1000 spaces) would be moved to a quarter mile from the rail station.\n\nHarbor Point Gateway Garage, at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and West Henry Street, provides indoor parking near the station. The facility includes an electric vehicle charging station as well as a car wash/detail service. A pedestrian bridge over Washington Boulevard provides direct access to the train platform from the garage.\n\nThe number of people taking Metro-North to Stamford doubled from 2,155 in 1996 to 4,226 in 2006. In recent years, additional office space has been built near the train station to allow commuters to avoid Interstate 95, which is typically very congested during rush hour. For example, The Royal Bank of Scotland completed a $400 million office building in 2008 within 200 yards of the station.\n\nStamford is the busiest Metro-North Railroad station outside of New York City, with the only busier station being Grand Central Terminal. As of 2016, average weekday commuter ridership for the center was 30,000 passengers, ranking among the busiest in the metropolitan area.\n\nThe station, along with the Greenwich railroad station, is receiving increasing numbers of reverse commuters who work in Stamford but live in New York City. Reverse commuting has doubled from 1997 to 2007 and increased 150 percent since 1990, with 1,900 reverse commuters as of 2007. Younger employees, often single and with enough money to live in Manhattan, for instance, sometimes prefer to live there, although more housing and nightlife have come to Downtown Stamford in recent years. Metro-North has added trains and express service to serve these commuters. As financial companies move to Stamford from Manhattan, some employees often become reverse commuters. Larger companies that are farther away than a few minutes walk from the station routinely provide shuttle service for their workers.\n\nStamford receives very frequent rail service on the New Haven Line. During peak hours, trains at Stamford come in intervals as little as three or seven minutes apart. Reverse commute trains during rush hours also operate relatively frequently, at intervals of ten to twenty minutes. Off-peak trains in both directions arrive at Stamford every thirty to forty minutes, but usually within a half-hour of each other.\n\nAs of 2014, Stamford has been a central stop for a special \"Yankee Clipper\" Train. The direct train runs to and from all weeknight and weekend games to to serve New York Yankees baseball games and New York City FC soccer matches at Yankee Stadium. The trains are timed to arrive between 45 minutes and 2 hours prior to the start of the game, and depart between 20 and 45 minutes after they end.\n\nDue to ridership growth in recent years, eastern Connecticut rail service provider Shore Line East announced on March 19, 2007 that it would extend more of its trains to Stamford during peak hours. To coincide with the extension of this service, Metro-North added another five trains on the New Haven Line to cope with the increases in passenger demand at Stamford.\n\nAmtrak also runs three routes which stop at Stamford: the \"Acela Express\", the only high-speed rail service in the United States, the \"Northeast Regional\", providing local service along the Northeast Corridor, on which Stamford is a vital station, and the \"Vermonter\", the only train from Connecticut that goes to Vermont. Stamford is now the second-busiest Amtrak station in Connecticut, after New Haven's Union Station.\n\n"}

He lived in Paris in the 1920s, as part of its famous expatriate American writers' circle, when he met his first wife, Josephine Herbst in 1924. Herbst enjoyed more success as a writer than Herrmann; the couple lived a few years in rural Pennsylvania, and were friends with Katherine Anne Porter, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, William Carlos Williams, and others.\n\nHerrmann's first novel, \"What Happens\", was original published in Paris by Robert McAlmon's Contact Editions press. Copies were seized by U.S. Customs upon their arrival in the United States on the charge of violating the 1922 Tariff Act, which banned the import of obscene materials from foreign countries. Herrmann fought the charge in a jury trial in New York City in October 1927 but ultimately lost. Despite supporters such as Genevieve Taggard, H.L. Mencken, and Katharine Anne Porter, the jury responded with a negative verdict, and the judge ordered the seized copies destroyed.\n\nAfter returning to Michigan in 1924, Herrmann wrote a manuscript about anti-German backlash during World War I but was unable to get it published. Researcher Sara Kosiba found the manuscript in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin and arranged to have it published in 2018 under the title \"Foreign Born.\"\n\nIn 1932, Herrmann's short novel, \"The Big Short Trip,\" tied with Thomas Wolfe for the Scribner's Magazine short novel prize.\n\nIn 1934, he went to work with Harold Ware and his organization Farm Research, Inc., which worked with the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Herrmann soon was a part of the Ware group, a secret apparatus of the CPUSA and Comintern in Washington, D.C., which supplied classified information to Soviet intelligence. From early 1934 until the summer of 1935, Herrmann was a paid courier for the CPUSA, delivering material emanating from the secret cells of sympathetic government employees being cultivated by Hal Ware to New York City. Herrmann also was the person who introduced Whittaker Chambers to Alger Hiss.\n\nIn 1940, Herrmann divorced Herbst and married Ruth Tate. He served in the United States Coast Guard, enlisting in New Orleans, in World War II. The couple fled the country and went to Mexico, when the FBI's Hiss-investigations began. He was placed under surveillance and questioned many times in Mexico by the FBI.\n\nHerrmann applied in March 1949 to Mexico City College (MCC) as a speech and drama major but attended for only the Fall 1950 and Winter 1951 quarters. A photograph in the November 16, 1950, issue of MCC's student paper, the \"Collegian\", shows Earl Sennett speaking to twelve students in his \"Studio Stages\" drama group; among them are Frank Jeffries, Alice Hartman, and John Herrmann. During his time at MCC, Herrmann was also, according to James W. Grauerholz's 2002 investigation, in an apartment located at 122 Monterrey hours before William Burroughs shot and killed his wife Joan Vollmer Burroughs.\n\nHe died near the Pacific Ocean in April 1959, at the \"Hotel Navidad\", in Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, Mexico from a heart attack.\n\n\n\"The Big Short Trip.\" \"Scribner's Magazine\" August 1932, p. 65-69, 113-128.\n\n"}

The work has set numbers with recitatives. It has been described as a modern example of a ballad opera. Contemporary comment noted the use of humour and the role of the chorus in the work, in the context of developing English opera.\n\nAccording to Michael Kennedy, the composer took first inspiration for the opera from this question to Bruce Richmond, editor of \"The Times Literary Supplement\", around 1909–1910:\n\nVaughan Williams worked on the opera for a number of years, before and after World War I. The work did not receive its first performance until 4 July 1924 at the Royal College of Music, London, in performances described as \"private dress rehearsals\". The \"professional premiere\" was at His Majesty's Theatre, London, on 14 July 1924. \nThe opera's first performance in the United States took place on 21 February 1928 under the auspices of the Washington National Opera, a semi-professional company not related to its present namesake. Tudor Davies created the role of Hugh in both these productions.\n\nThe opera was performed by the professional Canadian Opera Company in Toronto in November 1929, at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, with a live radio broadcast from the Royal York Hotel on 13 November 1929. In the broadcast, hockey broadcaster Foster Hewitt provided narrative for the fight sequence. These Toronto performances were conducted by Sir Ernest MacMillan, music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1931 to 1955, and featured American tenor Allan Jones in the title role of Hugh. Jones would soon become a Hollywood star. Vaughan Williams continued to revise the libretto and the opera over the remainder of his life. The final version was performed in 1956 and published in 1959.\n\n\n\"The outskirts of the town\"\n\nA fair is taking place; the people of the town have turned out; vendors hawk their wares. A showman presents an effigy of Napoleon Bonaparte and rouses the crowd to a fever-pitch of patriotic zeal.\n\nMary, the daughter of the local constable, appears with her aunt. Her father wants to marry her to John the butcher, a crass, overbearing man whom she does not love. When John roughly takes Mary’s arm to walk through the fairgrounds with her, she resists. He threatens her in turn, but when a troop of morris men passes through, the crowd follows along and John is pulled along with them, leaving Mary alone with her aunt.\n\nAs Mary sings of her dreams of freedom, a young man appears and tells her of his life on the open road. He is Hugh the Drover, a driver of animals, who makes his living by providing horses for the army. Mary is fascinated by his words, and Hugh tells her that he was fated to love her. The two declare their love for each other and embrace.\n\nThe crowd returns and the showman organises a prizefight, inviting all the men to challenge John the butcher. Hugh agrees to box, but only if the prize is Mary herself. He beats John in the match, only to have John spitefully accuse him of being a French spy. The crowd turns against Hugh and he is led off to the stocks.\n\n\"The town square, early morning\"\n\nA troop of soldiers has been sent for to take Hugh into custody. Meanwhile, he remains a prisoner in the stocks.\n\nMary stealthily comes to rescue him, having stolen the key to the stocks from her father. She frees him, but before they can escape, they hear John and his comrades approaching. Each refuses to leave without the other, and they both get into the stocks (which are large enough to hold two), draping Hugh's cloak over their bodies. When they are exposed, Mary's father disowns her and John refuses to marry her.\n\nThe soldiers arrive, and their sergeant recognises Hugh as an old friend who once saved his life. Instead of arresting him, they acclaim him as a loyal Briton – but take John the butcher for a soldier and march off with him.\n\nHugh and Mary reaffirm their love. Hugh asks Mary to join him, and she at first is hesitant, as is Aunt Jane to lose her. However, Mary finally says 'yes', and she and Hugh bid the town farewell to begin their life together.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

The busiest station is , with 8.4 million passengers, or 21% of the line's ridership.\n\nThis line was originally part of the main line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. It is colored red on Metro-North system maps and timetables; the New Haven used red in its paint scheme for the better part of its history. The section from Grand Central to the New York-Connecticut border is owned by Metro-North, and the section from the state line to New Haven is owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT). From west to east in Connecticut, three branches split off: the New Canaan Branch, Danbury Branch, and Waterbury Branch, all owned by ConnDOT.\n\nThe New Haven Line is part of the Northeast Corridor; its share of the Northeast Corridor is the busiest rail line in the United States. Amtrak's \"Northeast Regional\" and \"Acela Express\" use the line between New Rochelle, New York and New Haven. Shore Line East (SLE), a commuter service operated by Amtrak for ConnDOT, also operates over the New Haven Line from its normal terminus at New Haven, with limited express service to Stamford with a single stop in . \n\nThe rail line from New York to New Haven was completed by 1849, and commuters started using the trains soon afterward. The line was part of the New York and New Haven Railroad — after 1872, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad — which had trackage rights over the New York Central Railroad's New York and Harlem Railroad into Grand Central.\n\nThe Great Blizzard of 1888 blocked the rail line in Westport, between the Saugatuck and Green's Farms stations. It took eight days to restore service, as snow was dug out by hand.\n\nThe line was grade separated into a cut in Mount Vernon in 1893 as a result of multiple collisions between trains and horsecars.\n\nAs part of the construction of Grand Central Terminal in the early 1900s, all of New York Central's lines that ran into the terminal were electrified. Third rail was installed on the Hudson and Harlem Divisions, while the New Haven Division received overhead wires on the segments that were not shared with the Harlem and Hudson Division. Steam locomotives on the New Haven Division were replaced with electric locomotives, and later electric multiple units. New Haven Division electric trains started running to Grand Central in October 1907.\n\nThe New Haven was merged into Penn Central in 1969. On November 25, 1969, Penn Central, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the states of New York and Connecticut agreed that New York would buy its section of the line and Connecticut would lease its section as far as New Haven. The acquisition took place on January 1, 1971, and included the three branches. After Penn Central went bankrupt, the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) took over operations in 1976. The MTA took over operations in 1983, and merged Conrail's former commuter rail lines in the New York area into Metro-North. The MTA undertook to rebuild the railroad, upgrading signals, tracks, ties, roadbeds, and rolling stock.\n\nOver the years, some stations have been abandoned or closed, and some characteristics of the line have changed. The Columbus Avenue station in Mount Vernon was closed in the Penn Central era, due to its proximity to Mt. Vernon station and the expense of converting it to high-level platforms. It had previously been a transfer station to the overhead viaduct station of the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway; an impressive ruin remains and is easily visible from passing trains. Other stations abandoned along the mainline include Devon, at the junction of the Waterbury Branch, and Norwalk, replaced by South Norwalk. The changeover from catenary to third rail was moved from Woodlawn to just west of in the early 1990s. The catenary poles are still intact as they carry several communications lines. There is an abandoned rail yard just east of Port Chester station.\n\nThe New Haven's Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad, diverging from the main line below New Rochelle, ran local passenger service to the Harlem River Terminal in the South Bronx until 1931, and has several abandoned stations. It was a major freight route for the New Haven to Queens, where it interchanged with the Long Island Rail Road and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Four new stations are planned along this route as part of Metro-North's Penn Station Access.\n\nAs a largely four-track electrified mainline, the New Haven Line is capable of supporting a mix of local and express service, allowing for a higher density of stations than many other commuter rail lines. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were stations in every population center along the line. Although some of these were dropped over the years due to low ridership, no new stations were added for over 100 years. opened in December 2011 to support a new commercial development. After a decade-long process choosing between locations in West Haven and Orange, West Haven station opened in August 2013, filling the longest gap on the line. Currently, a study is being undertaken to detail the costs and benefits of implementing more frequent service on the line. The line would have to be upgraded to accommodate additional service.\n\nAn accident occurred at the Norwalk River bridge in Norwalk, Connecticut on May 6, 1855. Another occurred in Westport, Connecticut in 1895, and another in that town on October 3, 1912. Another fatality occurred in August 1969 on the New Canaan branch. There was also a collision in Mount Vernon in 1988 that killed an engineer. More recently, in 2012 two people were killed by a train-car collision at an ungated grade crossing on the Danbury Branch in Redding, Connecticut, and in 2013 a track worker was struck and killed in West Haven.\n\nThe May 2013 Fairfield train crash resulted in 72 injuries after two trains collided following a derailment near .\n\nOn September 25, 2013, a Con Edison failure required the use of diesel locomotives and bus service between Mount Vernon and Harrison for 12 days.\n\nNew Haven Line trains primarily use electric multiple unit (EMU) consists of Kawasaki M8 railcars. The line is operated primarily in two zones: an \"inner\" zone from Grand Central Terminal to Stamford, CT; and an \"outer\" zone from Stamford to New Haven.\n\nTrains from the outer zone generally run local, making most stops from New Haven to Stamford, and then express to Grand Central with a single stop at Harlem–125th Street and sometimes Greenwich as well. Trains from the inner zone generally originate in Stamford, running local and making most stops, also stopping at station. Passengers heading from one zone to another can make cross-platform interchanges at Stamford.\n\nDuring peak hours, trains generally run in shorter, express zones, making limited stops as they fill faster, with some overlap in start and end stations to allow for intra-zone transfers for those traveling locally. Many of these trains begin their runs at intermediate stations within their zones, and then run express to Grand Central or vice versa.\n\nAll New Haven Line electric trains change over between third rail and overhead catenary between Mount Vernon East and Pelham, at normal track speed. Inbound trains to Grand Central lower their pantographs in this area, while outbound trains raise them; the third rail shoes stay in the same position both in and out of third rail territory. Both catenary and third rail overlap for a quarter-mile between Mount Vernon East and Pelham to facilitate this changeover.\n\nThe entire mainline is grade-separated with no grade crossings, although there are several privately marked-pedestrian crossings in many of the storage yards such as the East Side Yard in Bridgeport.\n\nWithin the Metro-North system, the New Haven Line is the only line with operating branches. The New Haven Railroad, Metro-North's predecessor, had an extensive branch network in Connecticut, including: a branch off the Danbury Branch at the appropriately named Branchville, CT to Ridgefield, CT; another branch off the main line for freight at Bridgeport known as the Berkshire (a never-used bridge spans the Merritt Parkway in Trumbull that would have accommodated this branch under potential reactivation scenarios); and the Maybrook line, which connected the Waterbury Branch with the Danbury Branch, with several branches of its own.\n\nBranch lines generally operate as their own zones, with the first main line station as a terminus rather than Grand Central, providing transfers to other main line stations or Grand Central. During peak hours, some of these trains run express on the main line through to Grand Central, but generally remain as local service on the branch itself.\n\nThe New Canaan Branch is electrified, while the Danbury and Waterbury branches use train consists powered by diesel locomotives. Some main line trains will occasionally use diesel equipment in revenue runs for positioning or due to equipment shortages.\n\nIn contrast with the main line, the branches operate almost entirely at grade, with frequent crossings.\n\nYankees–East 153rd Street station opened on May 23, 2009. Although it is a Hudson Line commuter station, it offers New Haven and Harlem Line commuters direct game-day service on weekends and after weeknight games, and shuttle service from station during peak periods. The Yankee Stadium station, 125th Street and are the three Metro-North stations that serve New Haven Line customers without being located on the Line itself.\n\nThe \"Train to the Game\" service on the New Haven Line to the Meadowlands Sports Complex operated only for Sunday 1 pm New York Giants and New York Jets NFL games. The first game scheduled was on September 20, 2009, when the New York Jets hosted the New England Patriots, following a successful test of trains in non-revenue service on August 23. \n\nThe service was operated using New Jersey Transit (NJT) equipment under an operating agreement among NJT, Metro-North, and Amtrak. NJT equipment was required as its electric locomotive power was capable of running under the various catenary systems over three separate railroads using different power supplies. The program was only offered for the early afternoon games so that the NJT equipment could be moved back in place for the Monday morning rush hour.\n\nThe service made limited stops on New Haven Line, and used the Hell Gate Line to access New York Penn Station and Secaucus Junction. At Secaucus, riders transferred to a shuttle on the Meadowlands Rail Line. Stops included New Haven, West Haven, Bridgeport, Fairfield, Westport, South Norwalk, Stamford, Greenwich, Rye, Larchmont, Penn Station, and Secaucus.\n\nAlthough the New Haven Line shares track with the Harlem Line in the Bronx, along this line it stops only at , due to an 1848 agreement with the Harlem Line's predecessor railroad, the New York Central. This agreement granted the New Haven predecessor New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad trackage rights over the Harlem Line to Grand Central Terminal, but restricted its service in the Bronx to discharge service only (i.e. no boarding revenue passengers). This agreement continued until 2019, due to the operating agreement between Metro-North and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT), which means passengers traveling between Fordham and Manhattan could not ride on a New Haven Line train. Beginning April 14, 2019, passengers heading to and from Grand Central can also travel on New Haven Line trains. This was a result of an agreement reached with CDOT, under which revenue from tickets between Fordham and Manhattan would be split between Metro-North and CDOT. While the New Haven Line's one stop in the Bronx is currently at Fordham, from 1848 until the 1920s that stop was instead at .\n\nThe New Haven Line is also operated in Connecticut under an agreement between Metro-North and the ConnDOT, in which costs for main line operation are shared (currently 65% ConnDOT and 35% Metro-North) and costs for branch service are borne 100% by ConnDOT.\n\nSince 1996, the New Haven main line and New Canaan branch have used Automatic Train Control (ATC) in conjunction with cab signals, a safety feature used in routing trains, keeping safe distances, and moderating train speeds. Signals are controlled from a centralized location, the Operations Control Center in New York City. Until the 1980s, the New Haven Line had a decentralized signaling system, and each section of track was controlled by a separate switch tower. The switch towers themselves did not get radio communication with each other until the late 1960s, when Penn Central took over the New Haven Line. Track interlockings are governed within Control Point boundaries, or CPs. The New Haven Line is unique in that the CPs are known (informally) by nicknames for their region.\n\nSignals on the New Haven Line had once been mounted on the catenary bridges; these were all replaced throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s with wayside \"dwarf\" signals at track level along the right-of-way. The form of signalization known as Centralized Traffic Control, or CTC, is used on the main line and the New Canaan Branch, as well as on the Danbury Branch starting in 2013. The Waterbury Branch is currently \"manual block\", or unsignaled, territory.\n\nThe New Haven's traction power system was originally constructed to operate at 11 kV, 25 Hz, using power supplied by the Cos Cob Power Station. The power station was shut down around 1986 and Metro-North converted the traction power system to 60 Hz operation. Traction power is converted from utility-supplied 115 kV (single phase) to 27 kV (single phase with center tap), which is distributed using an auto-transformer system. Power is supplied to the catenary at 12.5 kV, 60 Hz.\n\nThe following connecting rail services are available from Amtrak, Metro North Railroad and Shore Line East.\n\nMilepost Zero on the New Haven Line is at the north property line of 42nd Street (i.e. 200–300 ft south of the ends of the tracks).\n\nSince the main line and the New Canaan Branch are equipped with 12.5 kV 60 Hz overhead catenary, as opposed to just the 750 V DC third rail of the Hudson and Harlem Lines, different rolling stock that can operate with either power system runs on the New Haven Line. This rolling stock, originally produced by General Electric in two batches (144 in 1972–73 and 100 in 1975–77), was initially branded as the M2 Cosmopolitan, with later versions being made on license by Tokyu Car (model M4, 1988) and Morrison-Knudsen (model M6, 1994). Cosmopolitans can be easily spotted by their red stripe along the side, the presence of pantographs on the lead cars in each set, and a dynamic braking grid on the roof.\n\nM2s operate in married pairs, differentiating them from their predecessor equipment of Pullman Standard and 4400-series washboard MU's (retired since the late 1970s and early 1980s). M4s and M6s also operate in triplets, with the middle \"D\" car not having a cab. Many M2s were reconditioned to extend their useful life beyond the expected 25 years (as of 2014 most are over or approaching 40 years old), undergoing a Critical Systems Repair (CSR) program.\n\nTo replace its aging M2 fleet and increase its total fleet size, Metro-North and ConnDOT have undertaken to purchase from Kawasaki Rail Car an initial order of 300 M8 EMUs. The initial order consists of a \"base order\" of 210 and a \"first option\" of 90 cars. This order is estimated to cost $760 million. The base order cost is to be split as per the ConnDOT/MTA operating agreement (65%/35%, respectively).\n\nAlthough the cost sharing is to conform with the operating agreement, due to Metro-North's capital budgeting process, Metro-North will initially pay only the first $100 million of the order, and ConnDOT will pay the remaining $660 million. Metro-North will bring its contribution to the required 35% upon passage of its 2010–2014 capital budget. Until then, ConnDOT will retain title to any rail cars which exceed its 65% share.\n\nM8s are similar to the M7As running on the Harlem and Hudson lines. They each have two single-leaf doors on each side and a full-width operator's cab, eliminating the so-called \"railfan\" windows at the front and rear of each train and restricting passengers' ability to walk between car pairs.\n\nM8s have the additional capability of running east of New Haven and along the Hell Gate Line west of New Rochelle to Penn Station over the former Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad. In order to run east of New Haven, the M8s are equipped with Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) as required by Amtrak. In order to run from New Rochelle to Penn Station, the cars will be equipped with third rail shoes that can operate on both over- and under-running third rail systems. Third rail will have to be extended in Queens for the M8s to overcome a gap between suitable catenary (Amtrak's catenary supply changes in Queens from the compatible system to the incompatible ) and the third rail utilized by the Long Island Rail Road.\n\nOriginally, delivery of the first six cars for testing was to be in July 2009, but was delayed until December 2009 for varied reasons such as design revisions and production delays. The contract allows for additional options for ConnDOT of an additional 80 cars, which may be used for Cafe Cars or for use on Shore Line East at ConnDOT's sole expense, an option that has since been exercised. Procurement of more than 380 cars would require additional authorization (PA 05-4 JSS provides funds to acquire at least 342 rail cars at slightly under $900 million).\n\nOn July 20, 2011, the Connecticut Department of Transportation announced the order of 25 unpowered M8 railcars, with options for up to 25 more, at a cost of US$93 million to replace the 48-car M6 fleet.\n\nThe CSR program was modified in 2008 as the delivery of M8s neared. Cars that underwent CSR earlier in the program were undergoing additional renovation. Funding was identified in the MTA's 2010 capital program to continue the CSR program if the M4 and M6 cars were not retired. The M2's are slated for retirement as sufficient numbers of the Kawasaki-made M8s enter service and alleviate current equipment shortages.\n\nA new rail car facility to accommodate the new M8 cars is being built in New Haven. Although the project itself is not controversial, the building of it is. Originally estimated at $300 million, the facility is now expected to cost in excess of $1 billion.\n\nAs with the Harlem and Hudson Lines, diesel-powered trains are driven by Brookville BL20-GH and dual-mode GE Genesis P32AC-DM locomotives, paired with Shoreliner coaches. While some peak-period trains operate directly to and from Grand Central Terminal with Genesis P32AC-DM dual-mode locomotives only, most New Haven Line diesel-only territory is operated as shuttle service between Danbury and South Norwalk, or between Waterbury and Bridgeport.\n\nRolling stock used for Metro-North diesel service is in pool service, meaning that diesel consists feature both ConnDOT-owned red-striped and Metro-North-owned blue-striped coaches operating on any of Metro-North's three lines, along with diesel power in either Metro-North or ConnDOT paint schemes.\n\nA 2010 study of the New Canaan and Waterbury branches considered the construction of a station at Devon Wye in Milford, Connecticut, where the Waterbury Branch joins the New Haven mainline. The station would allow service to be increased on the branch by running some trains to the new station with connections to New Haven trains, rather than taking up slots on the busy mainline. The two station alternatives would have cost $73 to $114 million.\n\nFor six months in 2015, a temporary Devon Transfer station served as the transfer point between mainline service and Waterbury Branch trains. The first phase of repairs to the adjacent Housatonic River Railroad Bridge over the Housatonic River prevented Waterbury Branch trains from accessing the normal transfer point at Bridgeport, necessitating the temporary transfer station. The Devon Transfer station was re-activated in 2016 from April until October to accommodate additional repairs and catenary wire work.\n\nOn July 16, 2014, Connecticut Governor Malloy approved $2.75 million to be spent for the planning of a station in the East End of Bridgeport, Connecticut. The new station, called after showman and former Bridgeport mayor P.T. Barnum, is planned to open in 2021. The station will have two island platforms, allowing for improved express service on the New Haven Line, increasing capacity.\n\nAfter several years of contention, West Haven was chosen over Orange in December 2001 as the site for a new station, which opened in 2013. However, local advocates continued to push for an additional station in . In July 2011, Governor Malloy signed a bill that sought a funding source, but that committed no funds to the project. On February 1, 2017, the Connecticut State Bond Commission authorized $21 million for design work for the station, in addition to funding for the upgrade of a station on the Danbury Branch. Design on the station began in January 2017, and construction on the station will begin in spring 2019, before being completed in fall 2021.\n\nIn connection with the planned redevelopment of the Gilbert & Bennett Wire Mill as a residential neighborhood, reopening a Georgetown station on the Danbury Branch has been approved, though not yet scheduled or funded. The previous station was abandoned in the 1970s due to low ridership.\n\nThe Waterbury and New Canaan Branch study also considered a new station on the Waterbury Branch as a park-and-ride station off the Wilbur Cross Parkway near where it meets the Merritt Parkway in Milford. The station was estimated to cost $41 million to construction.\n\nAlthough not yet past the Draft Environment Impact Statement stage, a study of enhancing service on and extending the Danbury Branch would include additional stations in North Danbury (Federal Road), , and New Milford. The draft EIS was due by 2010, and the final EIS by 2011. The Spring 2009 Update for the first time held out the possibility of extension all the way to Pittsfield, MA, the original route of the New Haven Berkshire Division. Trackage rights would have to be negotiated with the Housatonic Railroad, which owns the line beyond Danbury to New Milford.\n\nEnhancements to the Danbury Branch being studied also include re-electrification of the branch (the branch was electrified from 1925 to 1961), addition of passing sidings, realignment and/or super-elevation of track to eliminate or alleviate curvature and enhance speeds, and installation of automated train control signalling. The new signal system finally began operation in 2013, but extensive work was still ongoing in 2014 because of unresolved problems with the drop gates at grade crossings.\n\nEarlier versions of the study examined service to Newtown and Brewster along the Beacon/Maybrook line, as additional branches off the Danbury Branch. These options were not recommended due to limited ridership potential versus additional cost.\n\nAs part of the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, additional service from the New Haven Line will be provided to New York Penn Station over the Hell Gate Line of the Northeast Corridor, owned by Amtrak. Trackage rights and union agreements would have to be negotiated for this service. Commuter service over this line, formerly the Harlem River Branch of the predecessor New Haven, ended in 1931. New stations will be built at Hunts Point, Parkchester–Van Nest, Morris Park, and Co-Op City.\n\nThis project was dormant from approximately 2002 to 2009, but an environmental assessment was announced by Metro-North, to be completed by 2011. The study was in conjunction with ongoing studies for the best uses of Penn Station. The study advances a single option of full (both peak and off-peak) service to Penn on the New Haven and Hudson Lines. Separate options for off-peak service are still being considered separate from the study, as implementation could take place with existing infrastructure and equipment. However, the project was delayed, so environmental and federal reviews are to be completed by 2017.\n\nOn January 8, 2014, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo voiced support for the project in his 2014 State of the State address.\n\nIn its 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA budgeted $695 million for New Haven Line Penn Station Access work, including track, structures, signal, power and communications work along the Hell Gate Line, specifications for rolling stock for the line, and construction of the four new stations. New track will be installed between the Parkchester/Van Nest station and north of the Co-Op City station. Three bridges along the route will be rehabilitated or replaced. The MTA plans to complete necessary environmental and federal reviews by 2017. \n\nService will begin after East Side Access service commences. The opening of that project would divert some Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal, therefore opening up slots at Penn Station for Metro-North service. During peak hours there will be between six and ten trains to Penn Station. There will be four trains per hour to Connecticut in the reverse peak direction, and there will be two trains per hour to and from Penn Station during off-peak and weekends.\nIn a limited form, it already takes place with the Jets/Giants game-day service to the Meadowlands, although it is not intended as service to Penn.\n\nAs of February 2009, Connecticut legislators were discussing service on an old New Haven passenger line that ceased passenger service decades prior known as the Highland Line, part of the original New England Railroad, also known as the Central New England Railway, both eventual subsidiaries of The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.\n\nCurrently, this is a freight-only line operated by Pan Am Railways. Station stops would include two in Bristol, as well as in New Britain, between Waterbury and Hartford. The next step is a preliminary scoping study, which would be followed by environmental studies. It is unknown if this will be a Metro-North extension of the Waterbury Branch.\n\nThe New York State Department of Transportation, the New York State Thruway Authority, and Metro-North conducted extensive studies concerning the replacement of the deteriorated Tappan Zee Bridge. Proposals for rail connections to the New Haven Line were ultimately rejected as too expensive.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2046624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046624", "title": "Marika Papagika", "text": "Marika Papagika\n\nMarika Papagika (, née Katsoris; September 1, 1890 – August 2, 1943) was a popular Greek singer in the early 20th century and one of the first Greek women singers to be heard on sound recordings.\n\nMarika Papagika was born on the island of Kos on September 1, 1890. In late 1913 or early 1914, she recorded for the Gramophone Company in Alexandria, Egypt. Only one of those recordings has so far been found.\n\nShe emigrated to America through Ellis Island in 1915 with her husband, Kostas (Gus) Papagika, a cymbalom player who was also her accompanist. In July 1918, she made her first trial recording in the States for Victor Records, though her first published Victor recordings were made in December of that year. In July 1919 she also began recording for Columbia Records. Marika Papagika was thus among the first to record Greek music in the USA. She also recorded a number of songs in Turkish. By 1925, Marika and Kostas had opened a nightclub in New York on W. 34th St near 8th Ave, called Marika's, likely the first café-aman—a gathering place characterized by Greek cuisine and Greek music—to appear in the States. Marika's wasn't just a café-aman, but a speakeasy for Greek people as well as for other Mediterranean immigrants. Marika's attracted not only Greeks as regular patrons, but also Albanians, Arabs, Armenians, Bulgarians and Turks.\n\nBetween 1918 and 1929, she recorded at least 232 performances of café-aman styled songs, including kleftiko demotikο (Greek traditional songs about Klephts, heroic brigands), rebetiko, and light classical pieces, many of them overlapping with her chief rival in Greek music sales in the United States, Koula Antonopoulos (known on her recordings as \"Kyria Koula\" or \"Madame Coula\").\n\nMarika's café-aman was a successful business until the stock market crashed. The club closed in 1930, and Marika Papagika's recording career ended, except for four sides recorded for Victor in 1937.\n\nIn her later years Marika lived with her husband on Staten Island, New York, where she died on August 2, 1943.\n\nMarika Papagika distinguished herself from most of her contemporaries by virtue of her sweet soprano voice with its relatively high tessitura, her vocal timbre, somewhat reminiscent of Western classical singers, and her diction. The style and sound of her recordings is further distinguished by the particular accompaniment which graced most of them, namely the unusual combination of cymbalom and violoncello, plus a violin or a clarinet, and, very occasionally, a xylophone. Her occasional forays into more purely Western songs also set her apart from her female contemporaries on both sides of the Atlantic. It is perhaps reasonable to understand the performance styles of Mr. & Mrs Papagika & Co. as a true echo of the \"santouro-violi\" (santouri and violin) music of late 19th century urban Ottoman and mainland Greece.\n\nThe major source of information as to Papagika's accompanists is Richard Spottswood's Ethnic Music On Records Vol 3 pp 1197–1204. Papagika was accompanied on all but about 50 of her recordings by her husband Gus and by cellist Markos Sifnios, one of very few cellists in Greek folk music recordings. The upper instrumental part was usually played by one of various violinists, including Athanasios Makedonas, Vangelis Naftis (to whom she calls out on the song \"Aïdinikos Horos\"), George Theologou, and the Epirot Alexis Zoumbas, or by a clarinettist, most frequently Nicholas Relias (1922–1925), and on one session Pete Mamakos.\nSome orchestral accompaniments were directed by Nathaniel Shilkret, some by hitherto anonymous directors.\n\nAfter her death, Papagika's music faded into obscurity, and was only available to those with access to her 78 rpm records, often collectors and enthusiasts in the USA and in Greece. From 1976 onwards, with the first crop of LP reissues of Greek music from the earlier decades of the 20th century, her songs were again to be heard. In Greece a total of at least twenty-nine of her songs were reissued on eight LPs between 1976 and 1984 (see discography). In 1984(?) a USA-produced LP featured two Papagika songs. During the analogue reissue era Papagika was thus represented as generously on LP as her colleague Roza Eskenazi, and considerably more than Rita Abadzi and Madame Coula. Since the early 1990s, Papagika's songs have featured regularly in American, French, and Greek-produced CD reissues focusing on the musical genre often called \"rebetiko\", including the first reissue solely dedicated to her, a 19-track compilation released in 1994 by Alma Criolla Records, USA. In 1995, Marika Papagika was the subject of an episode of NPR’s \"All Things Considered\" where Dick Spottswood introduced her music to the North American audience. The first Greek reissue entirely dedicated to Papagika appeared in 1999, and this was expanded to a 3-CD set in 2008, presenting a grand total of 52 songs. A recent USA LP reissue has included seven songs previously not reissued.\n\nThis is an alphabetical selection comprising about one sixth of Papagika's recorded output. Some songs were recorded twice at a few years' interval.\n\n\nFor the sake of historical accuracy this chronological reissue discography includes reissues from 1976 onwards. The first 8 entries refer to 33rpm LPs. All subsequent issues but the Mississippi LPs are CDs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2046625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046625", "title": "Steam whistle", "text": "Steam whistle\n\nA steam whistle is a device used to produce sound with the aid of live steam, which acts as a vibrating system (compare to train horn).\n\nThe whistle consists of the following main parts, as seen on the drawing: the whistle bell (1), the steam orifice or aperture (2), and the valve (9).\n\nWhen the lever (10) is pulled (usually via a pull cord), the valve opens and lets the steam escape through the orifice. The steam will alternately compress and rarefy in the bell, creating the sound. The pitch, or tone, is dependent on the length of the bell; and also how far the operator has opened the valve. Some locomotive engineers invented their own style of whistling.\n\nSteam whistles were often used in factories, and similar places to signal the start or end of a shift, etc. Railway locomotives, traction engines, and steam ships have traditionally been fitted with a whistle for warning and communication purposes. Large diameter steam whistles were used on light houses, likely beginning in the 1850s.\n\nThe earliest use of steam whistles was as boiler low-water alarms in the 18th century and early 19th century. During the 1830s, whistles were adopted by railroads and steamship companies.\n\nSteam warning devices have been used on trains since 1833 when George Stephenson invented and patented a steam trumpet for use on the Leicester and Swannington Railway.\nPeriod literature makes a distinction between a steam trumpet and a steam whistle.\nA copy of the trumpet drawing signed May 1833 shows a device about eighteen inches high with an ever-widening trumpet shape with a six-inch diameter at its top or mouth. It is said that George Stephenson invented his trumpet after an accident on the Leicester and Swannington Railway where a train hit either a cart, or a herd of cows, on a level crossing and there were calls for a better way of giving a warning. Although no-one was injured, the accident was deemed serious enough to warrant Stephenson’s personal intervention. One account states that [driver] Weatherburn had `mouthblown his horn' at the crossing in an attempt to prevent the accident, but that no attention had been paid to this audible warning, perhaps because it had not been heard.\n\nStephenson subsequently called a meeting of directors and accepted the suggestion of the company manager, Ashlin Bagster, that a horn or whistle which could be activated by steam should be constructed and fixed to the locomotives. Stephenson later visited a musical instrument maker on Duke Street in Leicester, who on Stephenson's instructions constructed a ‘Steam Trumpet’ which was tried out in the presence of the board of Directors ten days later.\n\nStephenson mounted the trumpet on the top of the boiler's steam dome, which delivers dry steam to the cylinders. The company went on to mount the device on its other locomotives\n\nLocomotive steam trumpets were soon replaced by steam whistles. Air whistles were used on some Diesel and electric locomotives, but these mostly employ air horns.\n\nAn array of steam whistles arranged to play music is referred to as a calliope.\n\nIn York, Pennsylvania, a variable pitch steam whistle at the New York Wire Company has been played annually on Christmas Eve since 1925 (except in 1986 and 2005) in what has come to be known as \"York's Annual Steam Whistle Christmas Concert\". On windy nights, area residents report hearing the concert as far as 12 to 15 miles away. The whistle, which is in the Guinness Book of World Records, was powered by an air compressor during the 2010 concert due to the costs of maintaining and running the boiler.\n\n\n\nA whistle has a characteristic natural resonant frequency that can be detected by gently blowing human breath across the whistle rim, much as one might blow over the mouth of a bottle. The active sounding frequency (when the whistle is blown on steam) may differ from the natural frequency as discussed below. These comments apply to whistles with a mouth area at least equal to the cross-sectional area of the whistle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhistle sound level varies with several factors:\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic length or effective length is the quarter wavelength generated by the whistle. It is calculated as one quarter the ratio of speed of sound to the whistle’s frequency. Acoustic length may differ from the whistle’s physical length, also termed geometric length. depending upon mouth configuration, etc. The end correction is the difference between the acoustic length and the physical length above the mouth. The end correction is a function of diameter whereas the ratio of acoustic length to physical length is a function of scale. These calculations are useful in whistle design to obtain a desired sounding frequency. Working length in early usage meant whistle acoustic length, i.e., the effective length of the \"working\" whistle, but recently has been used for physical length including the mouth.\n\nLoudness is a subjective perception that is influenced by sound pressure level, sound duration, and sound frequency. High sound pressure level potential has been claimed for the whistles of Vladimir Gavreau, who tested whistles as large as 1.5 meter (59-inch) diameter (37 Hz).\nA 20-inch diameter ring-shaped whistle (“Ultrawhistle”) patented and produced by Richard Weisenberger sounded 124 decibels at 100 feet. The variable pitch steam whistle at the New York Wire Company in York, Pennsylvania, was entered in the Guinness Book of World Records in 2002 as the loudest steam whistle on record at 124.1dBA from a set distance used by Guinness. The York whistle was also measured at 134.1 decibels from a distance of 23-feet.\n\nA fire-warning whistle supplied to a Canadian saw mill by the Eaton, Cole, and Burnham Company in 1882 measured 20 inches in diameter, four feet nine inches from bowl to ornament, and weighed 400 pounds. The spindle supporting the whistle bell measured 3.5 inches diameter and the whistle was supplied by a four-inch feed pipe.\nOther records of large whistles include an 1893 account of U.S. President Grover Cleveland activating the “largest steam whistle in the world,” said to be “five feet” at the Chicago World's Fair.\nThe sounding chamber of a whistle installed at the 1924 Long-Bell Lumber Company, Longview, Washington measured 16 inches diameter x 49 inches in length.\nThe whistle bells of multi-bell chimes used on ocean liners such as the \"RMS Titanic\" measured 9, 12, and 15 inches diameter.\nThe whistle bells of the Canadian Pacific steamships \"Assiniboia\" and \"Keewatin\" measured 12 inches in diameter and that of the Keewatin measured 60 inches in length.\nA multi-bell chime whistle installed at the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company in 1926 was composed of five separate whistle bells measuring 5 x15, 7 x 21, 8x 24, 10 x 30, and 12 x36 inches, all plumbed to a five-inch steam pipe.\nThe Union Water Meter Company of Worcester Massachusetts produced a gong whistle composed of three bells, 8 x 9-3/4, 12 x 15, and 12 x 25 inches. Twelve-inch diameter steam whistles were commonly used at light houses in the 19th century.\nIt has been claimed that the sound level of an Ultrawhistle would be significantly greater than that of a conventional whistle, but comparative tests of large whistles have not been undertaken. Tests of small Ultrawhistles have not shown higher sound levels compared to conventional whistles of the same diameter.\n\n"}

He was the 12th Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham from 1380-1386.\n\nVidyaranya helped the brothers establish the empire sometime in 1336. He later served as a mentor and guide to three generations of kings who ruled over the Vijayanagara Empire. Vijayanagara (Hampi), the capital of the empire, had a temple dedicated to Mādhavācārya.\n\nHe was also a reputed Sanskrit-language author. Some people identifies him as Madhavacharya, the author of the \"\", a compendium of different philosophical schools of Hindu philosophy and \"Pañcadaśī\", an important text for Advaita Vedanta.\n\nOne theory identifies Vidyaranya as Madhava, the brother of Sayana. This suggests that he was born to and in (modern-day Hampi).\n\nHowever, according to the records of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Vidyaranya was a different person, and Sayana and Madhava were actually his disciples. According to this account, Vidyaranya was born in c. 1296 CE in Ekasila Nagara (present-day Warangal). He was the elder brother of Bharati Tirtha, who preceded him as the \"acharya\" of Sringeri. This account also claims that Vidyaranya wrote some Veda \"bhashya\"s, and his disciples Sayana and Madhava completed these works.\n\nYet another theory states that Bharati Tirtha and Vidyaranya were the same person, although the Sringeri records clearly identify them as two different persons.\n\nVidyaranya was the spiritual head of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham (Sringeri matha) during 1377-1386 CE. He attained siddhi in 1391 CE.\n\nVidyaranya served as a prime minister in the Vijayanagara Empire and played an important role in the establishment of the empire. According to one narrative, the empire's founders Harihara Raya I and Bukka Raya I were two brothers in the service of the Kampili chief. After Kampili fell to the Muslim invasion, they were taken to Delhi and converted to Islam. They were sent back to Kampili as the Delhi Sultan's vassals. After gaining power in the region, they approached Vidyaranya, who converted them back to the Hindu faith. The historical authenticity of this narrative is a matter of debate. The contemporary documents, including the inscriptions issued by the earliest rulers of Vijayanagara, do not mention this account. The contemporary Muslim records refer to Harihara (as \"Harip\" or \"Haryab\"), but do not mention anything about his conversion to Islam, although they contain details of other converts from Deccan. The first works to mention this narrative were written over 200 years after the establishment of Vijayanagara.\n\nA local legend goes like this: Once, during a hunt, Harihara saw a big rabbit and sent his hunting dog after it. However, the rabbit bit the dog and escaped. While returning from the hunt, Harihara saw a holy man, and narrated the strange incident to him. The holy man was Vidyaranya. The two men went to the place where the rabbit had escaped. Vidyaranya told him that the place was sacred, and advised him to establish the capital of his new kingdom there.\n\nVidyaranya's most famous works are \"Pārāśara-Mādhavīya\" and the \"Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha\" \"Compendium of school of philosophies\", a compendium of all the known Indian schools of philosophy. To quote Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the \"Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha\" \"sketches sixteen systems of thought so as to exhibit a gradually ascending series, culminating in the Advaita Vedanta (or non-dualism).\" The sixteen systems of philosophy expounded by him are:\n\nThe \"Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha\" itself doesn’t contain the 16th chapter (\"Advaita Vedanta\", or the system of Adi Shankara), the absence of which is explained by a paragraph at the end of the 15th chapter, (the Patanjali-Darsana). It says: “The system of Sankara, which comes next in succession, and which is the crest-gem of all systems, has been explained by us elsewhere, it is, therefore, left untouched here”.\n\nVidyaranya tries to refute, chapter by chapter, the other systems of thought prominent in his day. Other than Buddhist and Jaina philosophies, Vidyaranya draws quotes directly from the works of their founders or leading exponents and it also has to be added that in this work, with remarkable mental detachment, he places himself in the position of an adherent of sixteen distinct philosophical systems.\n\n\"Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha\" is one of the few available sources of information about \"lokayata\", the materialist system of philosophy in ancient India. In the very first chapter, \"The Cārvāka System\", he critiques the arguments of \"lokayatika\"s. While doing so he quotes extensively from Cārvāka works. It is possible that some of these arguments put forward as the \"lokayata\" point of view may be a mere caricature of \"lokayata\" philosophy. Yet in the absence of any original work of \"lokayatika\"s, it is one of the very few sources of information available today on materialist philosophy in ancient India.\n\nVidyaranya's Pañcadaśī is a standard text on the philosophy of the Advaita Vedanta tradition. It consists of fifteen chapters which are divided into three sections of five chapters each, which are designated as Viveka (Discrimination), Deepa (Illumination) and Ananda (Bliss). The text elucidates many Vedantic concepts, such as, the five sheaths of individuality, the relation between Isvara (God), Jagat (world) and Jiva (individual), the indistinguishability of cause and effect, etc.\n\nVidyaranya wrote Madhavia Shankara Vijaya also known as Samkshepa-Sankara-Vijaya. The book is about the life and achievements of Shankara Bhagavat-Pada (Adi Sankara).\n\nVidyaranya also wrote a commentary on the \"Mimamsa Sutras\". He attained Siddhi after a six-year stint as an acharya of the monastery of Sringeri.\n\n\n\n"}

After the concert, Wetherell went to a Guitar Center with a student loan check and said to an employee, \"I would like the stuff to make a band\". He bought microphones, microphone stands, a guitar amplifier, two electric guitars and a drum kit – without knowing how to play any of them. Eventually, Wetherell decided to play drums while Groves, who had played upright bass in high school, played bass guitar.\n\nDuring the summer, they began holding auditions for a third band member, though these were largely unsuccessful. The auditions were held at Wetherell's place. Miyuki Jane Pinckard, who was dating Wetherell's roommate at the time, heard many of these auditions. Understanding that the auditions were going poorly, Pinckard decided to learn to play the guitar herself. Within weeks, the trio became Dealership.\n\nIn 1998, Dealership self-released their first album, \"Secret American Livingroom\". The band then briefly ran their own record label, Keiki Records, on which they released their second full-length album, \"TV Highway to the Stars\", in 2001. Keiki Records also distributed releases by the now-inactive San Francisco band Secadora, of which Chris Groves was a member. The band's third album, \"Action/Adventure\", was released on Turn Records, based in Santa Clara, California, in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Dealership went on their first (and only) tour of the United States. They also played at the X-Games.(citation needed)\n\nJesse Hudson joined the band in late 2006.\n\nRecording was begun on a fourth unreleased album, \"The Future is Far Away\", with an estimated 2008 release date. In November 2007, Pinckard announced on the \"game girl advance\" blog that Harmonix included the song \"Dots and Dashes\" in its iPod rhythm game \"Phase\", and noted that the track would be sold on iTunes. \"Dots and Dashes\" was to appear on the upcoming album. Their song \"Database Corrupted\" is a downloadable track in \"Rock Band 2\".\n\nSince the announcement of \"The Future is Far Away\", no official word has been heard from the band and it is thought to be disbanded.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A native of Oregon, he grew up in Hillsboro, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area. After reaching the Majors, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and retired in 2004 and returned to Hillsboro to coach at his old high school. As of 2013 he has been a consultant for the Hillsboro Hops, a minor-league affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks, helping the team's young players acclimatize to life as a professional baseball player.\n\nPetrick, who was born in Salem, Oregon, was a highly accomplished athlete while attending Glencoe High School in Hillsboro, Oregon. He played football, basketball and baseball. He was recruited to play college football as a safety. He ultimately signed a letter of intent to play college baseball for Arizona State. Petrick opted to enter the Colorado Rockies' farm system when they drafted him in the second round (38th overall) of the 1995 amateur draft.\n\nHis first season in the minors was for the single-A Asheville Tourists of the South Atlantic League in 1996. The next season, he spent with the high-A Salem Avalanche, and for the 1998 season he was promoted to the AA New Haven Ravens. Petrick then played for the AA Carolina Mudcats to start the 1999 season before being promoted to the Rockies' AAA affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox after 20 games.\n\nHe was called up to the Colorado Rockies for the first time in 1999 and hit .323 with 4 home runs in only 62 at-bats. In 2000, he hit .322 in 52 games for the major league club. However, he soon experienced a dramatic drop off in production, hitting only .238 in 85 games in 2001. On July 13, 2003, Petrick was acquired by the Detroit Tigers from Colorado in exchange for pitcher Adam Bernero. After an unsuccessful stint with the Tigers, Petrick was released. He attempted a brief comeback with the AAA Portland Beavers and the Toledo Mud Hens, and then retired.\n\nPetrick is only the second player (after Bob O'Farrell) to record 4 RBI in a major league game without getting a hit. He achieved the feat in a 15–11 loss to the San Diego Padres on September 20, 2000, allowing his teammates to score by way of two ground outs, a sacrifice fly and a bases loaded walk.\n\nIn May 2004, when Petrick announced his retirement from baseball, he disclosed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after the 1999 season. He revealed that as time went on, it had become clear that despite the medication and treatment he was receiving, the effects of Parkinson's would no longer allow him to play baseball at a high level. At one point he stated that his symptoms were due to Lyme disease, but he has since returned to discussing Parkinson's as their cause.\n\nPetrick did numerous interviews and spoke publicly about his story at various events and fundraisers in order to raise awareness of Parkinson's disease. His father Vern (former athletic director at Glencoe) also suffered from Parkinson's and past away in January 2019.\n\nPetrick has three daughters. Petrick's aunt is Connie Ballmer, wife of Microsoft CEO and billionaire Steve Ballmer.\n\nPetrick and Scott Brown have written a book called \"40,000 to One\" (), a collection of short stories from his life; The book was a New York Times best-seller in 2012 after ESPN aired a short film about Petrick.The film rights to the book were sold later that year. \n\nIn January 2013, the Hillsboro Hops announced that Petrick would join the Hops coaching staff as a consultant, assisting team \"acclimating to life as a professional baseball player.\"\n\nPetrick has developed a motivational website and clothing line called Strength Through Weakness; www.strengththroughweakness.com\n\n"}

The consents were granted by the Buller District Council and the West Coast Regional Council. The Buller Conservation Group, Forest and Bird and Te Runanga O Ngati Waewae, and the Department of Conservation appealed the consent decision to the Environment Court. The appeal was declined and the resource consents confirmed in a decision issued on 24 May 2005.\n\nJon Oosterman, a spokesperson for the campaign, vowed publicly that a direct action campaign would proceed to halt the mine. The Forest and Bird appealed the decision in the High Court, and in December 2005, the High Court dismissed the appeal.\n\nThe campaign involved organising public meetings to raise awareness, postcard and letter writing, lobbying, occupying the head office of the Solid Energy, scaling a four-story building and blockading Solid Energy's coal trains. Members occupied an area adjacent to the proposed mine site.\n\nThe SHVC \"Save Happy Valley! Worth more than its weight in coal!\" leaflet describes the area as:\n\nHappy Valley, in the Upper Waimangaroa, near Westport, is a stunning, wild and untouched landscape - home to 30 great spotted kiwi/roa and the rare \"Powelliphanta patrickensis\" snail. Eleven other endangered birds and animals inhabit this enclave of diversity. Happy Valley is a colourful mosaic of magnificent red tussock wetlands, low forests of lush mountain beech and dense mats of intricate herbfield plants scattered over striking sandstone rocks and bluffs.\n\nThe proposed mine site is located at Happy Valley which is an unofficial locally used name for an area to the east of Waimangaroa. It is 25 kilometres north east of Westport. Reasons for the opposition to the mine include acid mine drainage, loss of kiwi, \"Powelliphanta\" snail and tussock habitat, and climate change due to the burning of the extracted coal.\n\nAt the nearby Mt Augustus, Solid Energy has pushed another 'absolutely protected' endemic snail species to the brink of extinction, and plan to mine its last remaining 4ha of habitat. Forest and Bird obtained a declaration in December 2005 that Solid Energy needed permission from the Ministers of Energy and Conservation to translocate the snails before mining. This permission was granted in April 2006.\n\nThe Save Happy Valley Coalition released a press statement stating they were 'appalled' at the decision. A spokesperson stated that it was 'New Zealand's first state-sponsored species extinction' and that Chris Carter, the Minister of Conservation at that time, had bowed to pressure from Solid Energy and had ignored consistent advice from the Department of Conservation.\n\nThe Save Happy Valley Coalition Inc has since taken Solid Energy to the High Court, and sought a Judicial Review of the Ministers' decision. In March 2007, the High Court did not uphold the review and it awarded costs of $5760 to Solid Energy.\n\nIn 2007 individuals involved with the Save Happy Valley Coalition were targeted in a series of contentious anti-terror raids.\n\nIn October 2012 Solid Energy announced that work on the proposed mine at Happy Valley would be delayed.\n\nOn 12 June 2013, The Biodiversity Defence Society filed proceedings with the Environment Court, arguing that Solid Energy no longer holds resource consents for its proposed mine at Happy Valley, due to the expiry of the allocated time period of the consent.\nIn April 2008, the Sunday Star Times reported that Gavin Clark of the Auckland private investigation company, Thompson and Clark Investigations (TCIL), had offered a Christchurch man, Rob Gilchrist, $500 a week to inform on the Save Happy Valley Campaign, for the benefit of the state-owned coal company Solid Energy. In December of the same year Gilchrist was revealed to be a police informant and had infiltrated a number of activist organisations, including SHVC.\n\n"}

State and federal law mandates that all students who are enrolled in the tested grades and who are educated with Massachusetts public funds participate in MCAS testing.\n\nIf necessary, students are given multiple opportunities to take the test to maximize the chance that said student will pass the exam.\n\nStudents are prepared for the exams throughout their academic careers through primary and secondary education. However, if an individual student needs help improving in a particular test, the first step in giving that student the extra help he or she needs is to identify specific weaknesses. Sometimes the student, teachers, or parents are aware of the weaknesses, sometimes they are not. To ascertain what the student knows as well as what he or she needs to learn, a diagnostic test may be administered.\n\nStudents take different tests according to their grade level. In addition to these tests, students may be required to take tryouts and pilot tests. The following list is current as of spring 2017. It is required for a student to pass the English Language Arts, Mathematics and Science and Technology/Engineering portions of the Grade 10 test in order to meet the Competency Determination requirement.\nNote: High School students take a Science and Technology/Engineering test in biology, chemistry, introductory physics, or technology/engineering.\n\nNote: The History and Social Sciences test has been placed on hold due to budgetary concerns.\n\nAn Educational Proficiency Plan EPP must be developed for the subject matter area(s) in English Language Arts and mathematics in which students did not meet or exceed a scaled score of 240.\n\n10th graders who score at the Advanced performance level on one of the three high school state assessment tests in ELA, Mathematics, or STE (Biology, Chemistry, Introductory Physics, or Technology/Engineering); and \nscore at the Proficient level or higher on the remaining two high school state assessment tests; and \nhave combined scores from the three tests that place them in the top 25 percent of students in the graduating class in their district are eligible for the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship. Recipients receive a tuition waiver (not including fees) to attend state colleges and universities in Massachusetts. The waiver is in effect for 6 years.\n\nMCAS school and district level reports are released each fall on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website.\n\nThe MCAS has been criticized for being too narrow in nature and for pressuring teachers into restricting the curriculum to material covered by the tests. It has been met with opposition from mayor Scott W. Lang from New Bedford, who called it \"completely unsustainable\" and \"impractical\". He claimed that the MCAS was causing students to drop out of high school, and expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that public high school students must pass the MCAS to graduate. Charles Gobron, superintendent of the Northborough school district, claimed that the standards set by the MCAS were \"unfair\", and that the minimum threshold for proficiency on the tests was being raised each year, \"making it look like schools are doing worse than they really are.\" The MCAS has also faced opposition from public school teachers. Some, such as Joan Bonsignore of Easthampton High School, claim that the tests do not accurately demonstrate the skills of students, and that they cause anxiety among the students.\n\nThe University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute, a research arm of the University President's Office, wrote in 2001 that the MCAS do not measure school or district performance because 84% of the variation in the scores across schools and districts is due to socioeconomic factors. In other words, as the Donahue Institute reported, \"One of the consistent findings of this research is that demography explains most of the variation in test scores from district to district. Results from this year's research are similar to results from last year's work: about 84% of the variation in test results (scores for all of the test-taking students for the nine MCAS tests combined) is explained by demography. That is why Weston and Wayland have high MCAS scores and why Holyoke and Brockton have low MCAS scores. Thus, though demography is not destiny, it sets a strong tendency.\" In the end, wrote the Donahue Report, the MCAS scores tell more about a district's real estate values than the quality of its schools.\"\n\n\n"}

It parodies the erotic thriller movie genre, which at the time had reached its commercial peak. The film stars Armand Assante as a lawyer and cop named Ned Ravine who has an affair with a woman named Lola Cain played by Sean Young. Kate Nelligan stars as Ned Ravine's wife and Sherilyn Fenn stars as Laura Lingonberry, Ravine's secretary. The film's title is a combination of \"Fatal Attraction\" and \"Basic Instinct\", both of which starred Michael Douglas.\n\nNed Ravine, who is both a police officer and lawyer (who often defends the people he arrests), believes that he knows everything about women, and says that he will throw away his badge if anyone ever proves him wrong. While on a stakeout, he encounters a seductive woman named Lola Cain; the next day, Lola shows up at his law office, saying that she needs him to look over some papers she has come across. Meanwhile, Max Shady, who was just released from prison after seven years, starts stalking Ned, planning to kill him for failing to successfully defend Max in court.\n\nNed's wife Lana and her car mechanic Frank, with whom she is having an affair, start plotting to kill Ned in order to collect on his accident insurance, which has a triple indemnity rider; if Ned is shot, falls from a northbound train, and drowns in a freshwater stream, Lana will collect nine million dollars.\n\nLola gets Ned to come to her house to examine the \"papers\", which are actually a laundry receipt and an expired lottery ticket, and the two of them end up having sex in various wild ways. The next morning, Ned says that they can never do that again because he loves his wife; this drives Lola to start stalking Ned.\n\nA few days later, Ned takes the train to go to a legal symposium; Lana and Frank are also on the train, and so is Max. When the train passes over a lake, Lana shoots Max 36 times with a revolver, mistaking him for Ned, and he backflips through the door to his death; Ned thinks that Lana had acted to save his life. He arrests Lana, and then defends her in court, getting her cleared of all charges. Lana later kills Frank, believing that he was going to abandon her, by pinning him against a wall with his power drill; Lola witnesses this, and starts blackmailing Lana.\n\nNed confronts Lola, and learns that she and Lana are identical twin sisters; after Lana had smashed Lola's face with a shovel, the doctors had given her a whole new face, causing the man she loved to leave her for Lana; Frank was the man's son. Lola's plan from the beginning was to get revenge on Lana by seducing her husband and ruining her marriage.\n\nLater, Ned's secretary Laura tells Ned about Lana's plans to kill him, having figured it out herself. Upstairs, Lana is attacked by Lola, who drowns her in the bathtub. While Ned goes upstairs to investigate, Laura's abusive husband (whom she'd escaped from three years ago) comes in and confronts her; she kills him with a frying pan. Lola and Ned fight, and Lola falls to her death from the second-floor landing after Ned pushes her back with a powered-up hair dryer through a broken handrail (which Lana had sawed off earlier). As Ned and Laura embrace each other (and Ned throws his badge away), Lola and Lana come back to life and attack; Laura shoots them both. Ned and Laura marry a few days later.\n\nThe film received generally negative reviews from critics; it maintains an 18% \"Rotten\" score from 22 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nIn his review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert rated it one and a half stars out of four and stated \"It's a strange thing about the parody genre: Some of these movies work ... and some don't. And you can't say why, except that sometimes you laugh, and sometimes you don't, and the reasons for that are not arguable.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" felt the film's gags \"vary much too wildly in terms of timing and wit. All that hold this comedy together are a playful outlook and a conviction that detective stories are intrinsically funny, especially if the detective is as much of a blockhead as Ned Ravine. As played by Armand Assante, Ned is a bit too convincingly dense, but he does make a useful fall guy.\"\n\nThis movie was released in the spring of 1994 on VHS and it is available on DVD and Blu-ray, but only for North America and Europe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2046741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046741", "title": "Chaplet of the Divine Mercy", "text": "Chaplet of the Divine Mercy\n\nThe Chaplet of the Divine Mercy, also called the Divine Mercy Chaplet, is a Christian devotion to the Divine Mercy, based on the Christological apparitions of Jesus reported by Saint Faustina Kowalska (1905–1938), known as \"the Apostle of Mercy.\" She was a Polish religious sister of the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and canonized as a Catholic saint in 2000.\n\nFaustina stated that she received the prayer through visions and conversations with Jesus, who made specific promises regarding the recitation of the prayers. Her Vatican biography quotes some of these conversations.\nAs a Roman Catholic devotion, the chaplet is often said as a rosary-based prayer with the same set of rosary beads used for reciting the Rosary or the Chaplet of Holy Wounds. As an Anglican devotion, the Divine Mercy Society of the Anglican Church states that the chaplet can also be recited on Anglican prayer beads. The chaplet may also be said without beads, usually by counting prayers on the fingertips, and may be accompanied by the veneration of the Divine Mercy image.\n\nOn September 13, 1935, while Faustina was in Vilnius, she wrote of a vision of Jesus about the chaplet in her diary (Notebook 1 item 476). Faustina stated that Jesus asked her to pray the chaplet and instruct others to do so. Although the chaplet is said on beads like the Rosary, it is about a third of the length of the Rosary, and unlike the Rosary that has evolved over the years, the form and structure of the chaplet has remained unchanged since Faustina attributed it to a message from Jesus. \n\nAccording to Faustina's visions, written in her diary, the chaplet's prayers for mercy are threefold: to obtain mercy, to trust in Christ's mercy, and to show mercy to others. Faustina wrote that Jesus promised that all who recite this chaplet at the hour of death or in the presence of the dying will receive great mercy. She wrote that Jesus said:\n\"\"...When they say this Chaplet in the presence of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying not as the just judge but as the Merciful Savior.\"\" \n\nFaustina stated that Jesus also promised that anything can be obtained with this prayer if it is compatible with His will. In her diary Faustina recounted a vision on September 13, 1935 in which she saw an angel sent to a city to destroy it. Faustina began to pray for God's mercy on the city and felt the strong presence of the Holy Trinity. After she prayed the internally instructed prayers, the angel was powerless to harm the city. In subsequent visions, Faustina learned that the prayers she spoke were to be taught to all the people of the world.\n\nAccording to Roman Catholic tradition, the chaplet may be said at any time, but it is said especially on Divine Mercy Sunday and Fridays at 3:00 PM. The Chaplet is prayed daily at the National Shrine of The Divine Mercy in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. In the Philippines, the opening portion of the chaplet known as the \"3 O'Clock Habit\" (Filipino: \"Pangalangin Para Sa Ika-tatlo Ng Hapon\") is broadcast on radio stations and television networks daily since June 16, 1985 at 3:00 in the Afternoon. In 2000, Pope John Paul II ordained the Sunday after Easter Divine Mercy Sunday, where Roman Catholics remember the institution of the Sacrament of Penance. The hour Jesus died by crucifixion, 3:00 PM (15:00), is called the Hour of Mercy. In a novena, the chaplet is usually said each of the nine days from Good Friday to Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\nPope John Paul II was instrumental in the formal establishment of the Divine Mercy devotion and acknowledged the efforts of the Marian Fathers in its promotion in a Papal Blessing in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion. Although the prayers said on the beads of the rosary chain share specific similarities between the \"Chaplet of Divine Mercy\" and the \"Chaplet of Holy Wounds\", these are distinct chaplets and were introduced over 20 years apart, one in Poland, the other in France.\n\nThe Chaplet contains several unique prayers.\nThis prayer is optional, and may be used to begin the Chaplet:You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.\n\nThis prayer, repeated three times in succession, is also optional, and may be used along with the first opening prayer to begin the Chaplet:O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You!\n\nThis prayer opens each decade of the Chaplet:Eternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.\n\nThis prayer, repeated 10 times in succession, forms the body of each decade of the Chaplet:For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world.\n\nThis prayer, repeated three times in succession, concludes the Chaplet:Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world.\n\nThis prayer is optional, and may be used after the Holy God to end the Chaplet:Eternal God, in whom mercy is endless and the treasury of compassion — inexhaustible, look kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, that in difficult moments we might not despair nor become despondent, but with great confidence submit ourselves to Your holy will, which is Love and Mercy itself.\n\nThe chaplet is prayed on ordinary rosary beads that are also used to pray the Dominican Rosary. The structure of the Chaplet is as follows:\n\nThe Chaplet is begun on the short strand of the rosary beads: \n\nThe praying of the decades then follows, repeating this cycle for each:\n\nTo conclude:\n\nThe chaplet may be repeated over a period of nine days as part of a novena. According to Faustina's \"Diary\", Jesus himself in a vision asked that the Divine Mercy Novena be prayed as a preparation for the Feast of the Divine Mercy, celebrated each year on first Sunday after Easter. The novena should begin on Good Friday. There is a prayer intention for specific group of people on each of the nine days. The novena intentions for each day are:\n\n\n\n"}

With knowledge and consent of the husband, the cicisbeo attended his mistress at public entertainments, to church and other occasions, and had privileged access to this woman. The arrangement is comparable to the Spanish \"cortejo\" or \"estrecho\" and, to a lesser degree, to the French \"petit-maître\". The exact etymology of the word is unknown; some evidence suggests it originally meant \"in a whisper\" (perhaps an onomatopeic word). Other accounts suggest it is an inversion of \"bel cece\", which means \"beautiful chick (pea)\". According to OED, the first recorded usage of the term in English was found in a letter by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu dated 1718. The term appears in Italian in Giovanni Maria Muti's \"Quaresimale Del Padre Maestro Fra Giovanni Maria Muti De Predicatori\" of 1708 (p. 734).\n\nThis arrangement, called the \"cicisbeatura\" or \"cicisbeismo\", was widely practiced, especially among the nobility of the cities of Genoa, Nice, Venice, Florence and Rome. While many contemporary references to \"cicisbei\" and descriptions of their social standing exist, scholars diverge on the exact nature of the phenomenon. Some maintain that this institution was defined by marriage contracts, others question this claim and see it as a peculiarity of 18th-century customs that is not well defined or easily explained. Other scholars see it as a sign of the increasing emancipation of aristocratic women in the 18th century.\n\nThe \"cicisbeo\" was better tolerated if he was known to be homosexual. Louise d'Épinay wrote from Paris to her friend Ferdinando Galiani about the impending departure of marchese Alvise Mocenigo, the Venetian ambassador, whose tastes the ambassador had displayed in Paris:\n\nRegardless of its roots and technicalities, the custom was firmly entrenched. Typically, husbands tolerated or even welcomed the arrangement: Lord Byron, for example, was \"cicisbeo\" to Teresa, Contessa Guiccioli. After Byron's death, the Contessa's second husband, the Marquis de Boissy, was known to brag about the fact. Byron also famously analyzed the institution from an English point of view in his poem \"Beppo\". Attempts by the husband to ward off prospective \"cicisbei\" or disapproval of the practice in general was likely to be met with ridicule and scorn:\n\n\"Cicisbei\" played by set rules, generally avoiding public displays of affection. At public entertainments, they would typically stand behind their seated mistress and whisper in her ear. Customs of the time did not permit them to engage in relationships with any other women during their free time, making the arrangement rather demanding. Both parties could decide to end the relationship at any time. A woman's former \"cicisbei\" were called \"spiantati\" (literally \"penniless\", \"destroyed\"), or cast-offs.\n\nThe topic can be found in the contemporary poem \"Il Giorno\" (1763) by Giuseppe Parini. Other works from the period which make good (subjectively) use of the topic include:\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

Simon. The film stars Pryor, Cicely Tyson, Robert Christian, and George Coe. \"Bustin' Loose\" was produced by Michael S. Glick and Pryor.\n\nJoe Braxton (Richard Pryor) is a convict who violates his parole after a failed attempt to lift a bunch of televisions from a store in Philadelphia. After a dramatic attempt at reverse psychology with the judge (Bill Quinn), he is given a second chance at parole, and his parole-officer, Donald (Robert Christian), has him do something for him.\n\nDonald is also involved with school teacher Vivian Perry (Cicely Tyson), whose school was just closed down by the city due to budget cuts. While most of the children have been relocated, eight special needs students have yet to be relocated. Vivian decides to take them to her aunt's farm in rural Washington. Donald is against it, and at first gets Joe to tell her the old bus she planned on using would not work. However, that blows up in his face, but Donald then decides to have Joe go ahead and drive the bus to Washington.\n\nAs Joe, Vivian, and the kids get rolling, we learn a little more about some of the kids:\n\nWe also learn that all Joe thinks he is there for is to fix and drive the bus, but he finds out his true knack for helping out the kids, especially shown when he reads Annie the riot act for her hooker-talk, and saves Anthony from setting another person's property on fire, and even takes the kids fishing for the first time.\n\nAfter fixing the bus in the rain on a dirt road, Joe and Vivian have trouble getting it out of the mud. When Joe leaves to get help, he is found walking in lock step with a group of Ku Klux Klansmen, who follow him back to the bus. Joe then manages to talk the head Klansman and the rest into getting the bus out to get the kids to a hospital in Washington. (He suddenly claimed they were all blind.) They agree surprisingly sympathetically and push them out of the mud.\n\nSomewhere in Montana, Donald catches up with them at a motel, after finding out Vivian lied to him and falsified the kids records. After trying to flee in the middle of the night, Donald catches up with them and demands they return to Philadelphia, which the kids, Vivian and Joe all resist.\n\nAfter arriving at the farm, Vivian meets with a banker in order to secure a $15,000 loan to save the farm. One of the other kids overhears them and tells the rest of the kids this. Joe then confronts the kids, who are whining and protesting about their fate. Joe learns about this as well and heads into town where he sees an ad for a \"trapezoid scheme\" and goes in to learn about it, dressed as a cowboy from Texarkana. Eventually he works his way into sitting with the group and schemes to rip them off. He does and gets Vivian her $15K, then leaves with her, while two guys from the group chase pursue them. After evading them and burning the money, they go back to the farm where they have an argument about the money.\n\nThen they realize the old Rolls Royce from the bank is there, and found out the kids told the president of the bank (who is also the mayor of the town) a bunch of lies about what good things Joe and Vivian did, and it convinced the mayor to give the loan and make the kids a part of the community. After they celebrate, Donald shows up with a police officer demanding they all return to Philadelphia but has a confrontation with the mayor that he ends up losing. However, it did seem Joe was going to go back to Philly with Donald, but Donald gets to the end of the driveway, and changes his mind and lets Joe stay.\n\n\n\"Bustin' Loose\" was filmed in part in various towns in Washington state, including Carnation, Ellensburg, and Snohomish.\n\n\"Bustin' Loose\" opened number one at the box office in 828 theaters domestically. It grossed $6,622,753 in its opening weekend. Its run ended with $31,261,269 in the box office, domestically.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote in his review: \"ONLY the incomparable Richard Pryor could make a comedy as determinedly, aggressively sentimental as \"Bustin' Loose\", which is about eight needy orphans and a $15,000 mortgage that's due, and still get an R-rating. Vulgar language is the reason, but because vulgar language is a basic part of the Pryor comedy method, one longs for his every assault on genteelism in \"Bustin' Loose,\" a film that would otherwise be painful. \"TV Guide\" gives \"Bustin' Loose\" 4 stars out of 5 stars.\n\n\"Bustin' Loose\" was released in theatres on May 22, 1981.

Goldenson (December 7, 1905 – December 27, 1999) was the second president of the United States-based television network American Broadcasting Company (ABC), from 1953 to 1986. Goldenson, as CEO of United Paramount Theatres, acquired a then-struggling ABC from candy industrialist Edward J. Noble. Goldenson focused on investing heavily on sports and news coverage along with creating synergy between Hollywood studios and television networks. Goldenson turned ABC into a media conglomerate, owning television and radio stations along with newspapers and book publishers. His innovations with ABC in terms of programming and media synergy would have lasting implications on the American television industry, and be emulated by leadership of other networks. He was portrayed in the 2002 TNT movie Monday Night Mayhem by Eli Wallach.\n\nGoldenson was born to a Jewish family in Pennsylvania in 1905. He grew up in the town of Scottdale, Pennsylvania and graduated from Scottdale High School. He was educated at Harvard, and entered the entertainment industry in 1933 as an attorney for Paramount Pictures after graduating from Harvard Law School. Goldenson was hired to help reorganize United Paramount Theatres, Paramount's theater chain, which at the time was nearing bankruptcy. So skillful was his work at this assignment that Paramount's chief executive officer, Barney Balaban, hired Goldenson as deputy to the manager of the Paramount Theaters chain.\n\nGoldenson orchestrated the merger of United Paramount Theatres with ABC in 1953 (after Paramount was ordered to spin it off in the wake of \"United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.\", a 1948 decree of the U.S. Supreme Court). ABC was originally formed in 1943 in the wake of an earlier Supreme Court decree effectively ordering the spinoff of the largely secondary-status \"Blue Network\" from its then-parent, NBC; its buyer, industrialist Edward J. Noble, tried to build ABC into a competitive Broadcasting company, but by 1951 was rumored to be on the verge of selling the nearly bankrupt operation to CBS, whose management apparently wanted ABC's critically important owned-and-operated television stations.\n\nGoldenson rescued ABC by convincing his board of directors to buy the company from Noble for $25 million. becoming the founding president of the merged company which was named American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres. The modern ABC dates its history from the effective date of the Goldenson transaction, and not the Blue Network spinoff.\n\nAlthough he focused chiefly on ABC Television, Goldenson oversaw all areas of ABC-Paramount's entertainment/media operations for over thirty years, from 1951 to 1986, including the creation of the AmPar Record Corporation in 1955 and the 'rebadging' of the ABC-Paramount group as the American Broadcasting Company in 1968. Goldenson also was instrumental in the sale of ABC to Capital Cities Communications in 1986, which at the time, was the largest non-oil merger in history. Very early on in his tenure, Goldenson also hired the first African-American staff announcer in network television and radio history, Sid McCoy.\n\nHis wife was Isabelle Charlotte Weinstein, co-founder of United Cerebral Palsy. Goldenson, whose first-born daughter Cookie was born with cerebral palsy, co-founded United Cerebral Palsy in 1949 and used station WBKB (at the time owned by United Paramount Theatres) to be the flagship station for the inaugural UCP telethon that year.\n\nIn 1974, Mr. Goldenson received The Hundred Year Association of New York's Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" The Leonard H. Goldenson Theater at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences building in North Hollywood, California is named in his honor. Goldenson was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nGoldenson was known for always flying economy class and never driving a new car.\n\nHe died on December 27, 1999 at the age of 94. He was survived by his wife and his two daughters: Loreen Goldenson Arbus and Maxine Goldenson.

The Bridle Track, a scenic bush track, leads south-east along the Denniston Incline into the foothills of the Mt William Range, to Denniston. The Stockton mine, a large open cast coal mine, is operated in the vicinity by Solid Energy.\nThe Ngakawau Branch, a branch line railway, runs through the town. It opened to Waimangaroa on 5 August 1876; it formerly ran to Seddonville but now terminates in Ngakawau. From 1877 until 1967, Waimangaroa was also the junction for the Conns Creek Branch, which ran east alongside the Waimangaroa River to the foot of the Denniston Incline. Passenger services ceased on the Conns Creek Branch in 1931 and Ngakawau Branch on 14 October 1946. Since this time, the railway through Waimangaroa has almost solely conveyed coal.\n\nThe beaches to the west have dangerous currents and are not safe for swimming.\n\nWaimangaroa School was a coeducational full primary school (years 1-8).

It was written by John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. The song became a centerpiece at all Led Zeppelin concerts thereafter, until their final tour. It appears in both the film versions and both live album versions of \"The Song Remains the Same\", released in 1976 and expanded in 2007. It appeared once more in 1994 on Page and Plant's as the title track. It also appears on Led Zeppelin's 2012 live album \"Celebration Day\", which documented their 2007 reunion performance at the O2 Arena in London. It was re-released on the deluxe edition of \"Houses of the Holy\".\n\n\"No Quarter\" was recorded in 1972 at Island Studios, London. It was engineered by Andy Johns and also mixed by him at Olympic Studios, London. The version that made it onto the album evolved out of a faster version Led Zeppelin had recorded earlier at Headley Grange, an old mansion in east Hampshire, England. Jimmy Page applied vari-speed to drop the whole song a semi-tone, in order to give it a thicker and more intense mood. In addition to the pitch change, the album version featured a very highly compressed guitar track, giving it a tone unique to Led Zeppelin. The guitar solo effect was achieved by direct injection and compression.\n\nThe title is derived from the military practice of showing no mercy to a vanquished opponent and from the brave act of not asking for mercy when vanquished. This theme is captured in several of the song's lyrics. Like \"Immigrant Song\" three albums prior, it evokes imagery from the Vikings and Norse mythology, with lyrics such as “the winds of Thor are blowing cold.”\n\nRecord producer Rick Rubin has remarked on the song's structure, \"It takes such confidence to be able to get really quiet and loose for such a long time. [Led] Zeppelin completely changed how we look at what popular music can be.\"\n\nFrom 1973, \"No Quarter\" became a centerpiece at Led Zeppelin concerts, being played at virtually every show the band performed until 1980 (it was eventually discarded on their final tour \"Over Europe\" in that year).\n\nDuring live performances, John Paul Jones frequently improvised on keyboards and performed parts of classical music. On the band's ninth North American tour in 1973, performances of the song lasted twice the length of the studio version. On Led Zeppelin's concert tours from 1975 onward, Jones would also play a short piano concerto (on a Steinway B-211 grand piano) frequently turning the seven-minute song into a performance exceeding twenty and sometimes even thirty to thirty-five minutes, in a handful of cases. Page and John Bonham would always join him later in the song. He was particularly fond of playing Rachmaninoff pieces, but sometimes included Joaquín Rodrigo's \"Concierto de Aranjuez\" and \"Amazing Grace\" as part of an extended medley.\n\nIn Led Zeppelin's concert film \"The Song Remains the Same\", \"No Quarter\" was the thematic music behind Jones's personal fantasy sequence, in which he played a haunting masked horseman or highwayman roaming the graveyards. Jimmy Page also used a short segment of theremin as an added sound effect while playing the song live, as can additionally be seen in the movie.\n\nPage and Plant recorded a version of the song in 1994, without Jones, released on their album \"\". Robert Plant played a radically different version of the song as the opening number on his solo tour in 2005, as is included on the DVD release \"\". \"No Quarter\" was also a central part of Jones's own solo concerts between 1999 and 2002.\n\n\"No Quarter\" was performed at Led Zeppelin's reunion show at the O2 Arena in London on 10 December 2007, and was played in C minor to accompany Plant's vocals.\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"Houses of the Holy\", Gordon Fletcher of \"Rolling Stone\" gave \"No Quarter\" a negative review, calling the track, along with \"The Rain Song\", as \"nothing more than drawn-out vehicles for the further display of Jones' unknowledgeable use of mellotron and synthesizer.\"\n\n"}

The new, lighted facility had 5,000 seats. The name of the stadium was changed to Minnegan Stadium in 1983 to honor former Towson coach and athletic director Donald \"Doc\" Minnegan.\n\nThe sports complex began a $32 million renovation beginning in 1999. The renovations, which were completed in 2002, added 6,000 seats, artificial turf, an entry-level plaza, concession stands, new restrooms, ticket booths, a four-tier press box, a field house, and a promenade that connects the northside and southside seating areas.\n\nThe stadium is named for the Baltimore Colts' Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas, who had taken a job trying to find a corporate sponsor for the stadium with Towson University weeks before his death in 2002. In fact, Unitas threw his last public pass at the re-opening of the facility (as Towson Stadium) just a few days before his death. His widow, Sandy, felt it appropriate to honor him by having the stadium named for him instead, with fund-raising in his name taking the place of the money that a corporate naming would have supplied.\n\nIn 2008, the Unitas Stadium scoreboard was replaced with a 16:9 full video scoreboard. The new scoreboard stands where the previous scoreboard was placed. The old incandescent light scoreboard was recycled and a new smaller LED scoreboard was installed in the opposite endzone.\n\nIn May 2012, new \"Fieldturf Revolution\" was installed in the Stadium.\n\nIt is the home field for the Towson Football, Men's & Women's Lacrosse, and the Women's Track and Field team. The annual Fall Pep Rally is held at the stadium.\n\nIn addition to Towson events, the stadium has also been used for high school football and lacrosse events, the Under 19 World Lacrosse Championship, Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association Lacrosse Championships, several NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championships as well as competition in the NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championships.\n\nThe Baltimore Bayhawks of Major League Lacrosse used Johnny Unitas Stadium as their home stadium from 2004 to 2006.\n\nThe 2008 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Final Four and Championship were held in Johnny Unitas Stadium, where Northwestern University defeated the University of Pennsylvania 10-6, giving the Wildcats their fourth NCAA title in a row in the sport.\n\nThe 2009 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Final Four and Championship were held in Johnny Unitas Stadium where Northwestern University defeated University of North Carolina 21-7. This was the Wildcats fifth title in a row in Women's Lacrosse.\n\nThe 2010 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Final Four and Championship were held in Johnny Unitas Stadium where University of Maryland defeated Northwestern University 13-11. This was the Terps 10th NCAA title in Women's Lacrosse.\n\nThe Under Armour All-American Lacrosse Game for High School Athletes has been played at Unitas since 2006, its inaugural year.\n\nOn April 26, 2003 the final renovations to the stadium were completed with the construction of the four-story, field house located in the stadium's west end zone area. The field house features offices, meeting rooms, locker rooms, class rooms, a film editing room an athlete learning center, an athletic training room and an equipment room. The rooftop patio treat guests to a view of athletic contests.\n\nThe Minnegan room on the third floor of the field house is named after longtime faculty member, athletic director and coach \"Doc\" Minnegan. It is a multipurpose room that has a top view of the action on the field as well as the stadium. The Minnegan room can accommodate up to 200 guests.\n\nThis is an area that serves the student-athletes' medical needs. This facility includes separate taping, treatment, rehabilitation, and hydrotherapy areas. The state-of-the-art hydrotherapy and rehabilitation areas include the Swimex system and Biodex training equipment. The facility also includes a physician exam room, conference room, and staff offices.\n\n\n"}

Wilder also served as writer and director. The film also marked Radner's final appearance in a movie prior to her death of ovarian cancer in 1989. The title \"Haunted Honeymoon\" was previously used for the 1940 U.S. release of \"Busman's Honeymoon\" based on the stage play by Dorothy L. Sayers.\n\nIn the film, Wilder and Radner play Larry Abbot and Vickie Pearle, two radio murder mystery actors who decide to get married. Larry, plagued with on-air panic attacks, is treated with a form of shock therapy and subsequently chooses to marry Vickie in a castle-like mansion which had been his childhood home. Once there, they meet the eccentric members of Larry's family, including his great-aunt Kate (DeLuise) and his cousin Charles (Pryce).\n\n\"Honeymoon\" was distributed by Orion Pictures through a deal with HBO. It was a box office bomb (grossing just short of its $9 million budget), was critically panned and earning DeLuise's character of Great-Aunt Kate the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.\n\nLarry Abbot (Wilder) and Vickie Pearle (Radner) are performers on radio's \"Manhattan Mystery Theater\" who decide to get married. Larry has been plagued with on-air panic attacks and speech impediments since proposing marriage. Vickie thinks it is just pre-wedding jitters, but his affliction could get them both fired.\n\nLarry's uncle, Dr. Paul Abbot, decides that Larry needs to be cured. Paul decides to treat him with a form of shock therapy to \"scare him to death\" in much the same way someone might try to startle someone out of hiccups.\n\nLarry chooses a castle-like mansion in which he grew up as the site for their wedding. Vickie gets to meet Larry's eccentric family: great-aunt Kate (DeLuise in drag), who plans to leave all her money to Larry; his uncle, Francis; and Larry's cousins, Charles, Nora, Susan, and the cross-dressing Francis Jr. Also present are the butler Pfister and wife Rachel, the maid; Larry's old girlfriend Sylvia, who is now dating Charles; and Susan's magician husband, Montego the Magnificent.\n\nPaul begins his \"treatment\" of Larry and lets others in on the plan. Unfortunately for all, something more sinister and unexpected is lurking at the Abbot Estates mansion. The pre-wedding party becomes a real-life version of Larry and Vickie's radio murder mysteries, werewolves and all.\n\n\nWilder wrote the opening scene while filming \"Silver Streak\" in 1976. He wanted to make a \"comedy chiller\" inspired by such films as \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1939), \"The Old Dark House\" (1932) and \"The Black Cat\" (1941), and radio shows like \"The Inner Sanctum\". \"Since I was 6 years old I have been scared of horror movies,\" said Wilder \"And the movies that I liked the best - even though I was scared by them - were what was called then 'comedy-chillers.' They were horror movies yet they had comedy, or they were comedies and yet they had horror. They were not comedy-mysteries, they were not comedy-thrillers, they were comedy-chillers.\" Wilder says when he started writing the film \"I knew I wanted it to be a comedy-chiller,\" but he struggled and the film wound up as an \"autobiographical psycho/sexual comedy with music.\"\n\nWilder and Radner fell in love making \"Hanky Panky\" (1982) and he decided to revisit the project as a vehicle for them both. \"I always thought that Gilda has been one of our most brilliant television comediennes, but now I think she's becoming more than very good as a comic movie actress, which is a very, very different thing,\" said Wilder.\n\nWilder rewrote the script with writing partner, Tony Marsh. \"I knew that I wanted it to be not a parody and not a satire, but to re-create a comedy-chiller,\" said Wilder. \"I don't like naturalism. I like things that are fantastical - I'm not saying necessarily fantasies, but more than reality.\"\n\nWilder says the film was partly inspired by a song Jeanette MacDonald and Jack Buchanan sang in the film \"Monte Carlo\" (1930). Wilder says he heard it while watching the film in bed with Radner. \"I'm always looking for some emotional spine to what I'm doing. I look over at her [Radner] and tears are coming down from her eyes. It was so sweet and innocent. Like little children. And I thought that's what this ('Haunted Honeymoon') is about.\"\n\n\"I couldn't imagine him singing it with any other girl,\" said Radner. \"So, I just had a tantrum and said I had to be the fiancee - not a big tantrum, just a tiny tantrum.\"\n\nHe says he was also inspired by seeing Jean Cocteau's \"Beauty and the Beast\" in the early 1980s. \"The world opened up for me,\" he said. \"I'm more comfortable when I don't have to be held down by authenticity. In this film, which is set in the ’30s, I feel that I'm presenting authenticity of the heart. I'm not interested in everyday reality, but in the reality of the heart. I like fantasy, like a fairy tale. I'm interested in shadows and contrasts. It's like the opening scene in the movie, when a character says, `It's not what you think.' Well, it's probably what you think. But it's too complicated.\"\n\nThe movie was one of 14 films financed by Orion Pictures through a deal with HBO.\n\nThe film was shot in London at Elstree Studios in 1985 over 11 weeks. \"Gene calls it a 'comedy chiller',\" said Gilda Radner. \"For me, this is a part very similar to my own life. I wear a wedding gown in 95% of the movie. Since I didn't wear a gown when Gene and I got married, I asked the 'Haunted Honeymoon' photographer to make me a wedding album!\" Radner said.\n\nWilder says his aim was to \"make a 1930s movie for 1986.\" He and the cinematographer used no primary colors and lit the film darkly. \"It's black and white in color,\" said Wilder. \"The fat lady in Akron, Ohio, doesn't have to know that. But she should feel that it's believable in the way that an old '30s film is believable.\"\n\nWilder and Radner celebrated their first wedding anniversary during filming in September.\n\nJonathan Pryce later recalled, \"It was one of those films where, when there’s a break and they’re doing the next setup and people usually go back to their dressing rooms, nobody went back to their dressing rooms. We’d all sit around in a circle of camp chairs or whatever they call them—director’s chairs—and be entertained by Dom DeLuise. It was a blissful time. It was a great time.\"\n\nWilder says he told DeLuise to play his role straight, telling him, \"I want you to be my aunt. We'll get the laughs later. But first don't go for 'I'm-really-a-guy, I'm-really-a-guy, and-I'm-doing-this-little-joke.'\"\n\nOrion elected not to screen the film to critics before general release. Producer Susan Ruskin said: \n\nThe film received negative reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 18%, based on eleven reviews, and an average rating of 3.6/10. Dom DeLuise won the Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress for his performance in drag.\n\nThe movie was a financial flop, grossing only $8,000,000 in America, entering the box office at number 8, then slipping to 14 the following week.\n\nWhile Gilda Radner was struggling with cancer, she wrote the following about the film: \nAnother source said the film earned $3.2 million in the US.\n\n"}

{"id": "2046794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046794", "title": "Cape Wind", "text": "Cape Wind\n\nThe Cape Wind Project was a proposed offshore wind farm on Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, United States. It was approved but then lost several key contracts and suffered from several licensing and legislative setbacks. The developer, Jim Gordon of Energy Management Inc, eventually terminated the lease rights for the site in late 2017.\n\nThe wind farm, an offshore wind energy project in United States coastal waters, was projected to generate 1,500 gigawatt hours of electricity per year derived from wind power. National Grid and Northeast Utilities eventually terminated their power purchase agreements in January 2015, making it difficult to obtain financing necessary for the project to progress.\n\nThe project was expected to cost $2.6 billion. Cape Wind had arranged to borrow $2 billion through The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU). Siemens has agreed to supply the turbines for the project. Some construction began in 2013, thus qualifying the project for the federal production tax credit, which expired at the end of the year.\n\nThe proposed project covers , and would be from Mashpee, on the south coast of Cape Cod, and from the island town of Nantucket. Cape Wind's developer is Energy Management Inc. (EMI) a New England-based energy company with 35 years of experience in energy conservation and energy development. ESS Group, Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, has been the environmental science specialist for the project. Cape Wind is also being assisted by Woods Hole Group, K2 Management, SgurrEnergy, AWS Truepower, and PMSS. Barclays is Cape Wind’s Financial Advisor.\nThe project envisions 130 horizontal-axis wind turbines, each having a hub height of . The blade diameter is , with the lowest blade tip height at and the top blade tip height at . The turbines would be sited between 4–11 miles offshore depending on the shoreline. At peak generation, the turbines will generate 454 megawatts (MW). The project is expected to produce an average of 170 MW of electricity, about 75% of the average electricity demand for Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket island combined. It could offset close to a million tons of carbon dioxide every year and should produce enough electricity to offset the consumption of of oil annually.\n\nCurrently 45% of the Cape region's electricity comes from the nearby Canal Generating Plant in Sandwich, which burns bunker oil and natural gas. The Cape Wind proposal is distinct in that it would directly offset petroleum combustion, unlike most of the United States where electrical power generation from oil is rare and power from coal, natural gas and nuclear is more common.\n\nAdditionally, this project would decrease the amount of oil shipped to the Canal Generating Plant; fuel for this plant has been part of two major oil spills. The first was on December 15, 1976, when the tanker \"Argo Merchant\" ran aground southeast of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts spilling of oil. The second occurred in April 2003, when a Bouchard Company barge carrying oil for the Mirant Canal Generating Plant ran aground spilling of oil, which killed 450 birds and shut down 100,000 acres (400 km²) of shell fishing beds.\n\nBecause the proposed turbines are more than from shore, they are subject to federal jurisdiction. However, near-shore infrastructure including roads and power cables make the project subject to state and local jurisdiction as well. All necessary state and local pre-construction approvals were obtained by 2009. Major federal approvals were obtained May 17, 2010, with lease details, and construction and operation permits to be granted as the project proceeds.\n\nAt the state and local level, according to the \"Boston Globe\", Cape Wind needed approval from the Cape Cod Commission; \"a Chapter 91 license from the Department of Environmental Protection; a water quality certification from the state DEP; access permits from the Massachusetts Highway Department for work along state highways; a license from the Executive Office of Transportation for a railway crossing; orders of conditions from the Yarmouth and Barnstable Conservation Commissions; and road opening permits from Yarmouth and Barnstable.\"\n\nOn May 11, 2005, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (MEFSB) approved the application to build the wind farm. Opponents appealed the decision and on December 18, 2006 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld the decision.\n\nIn March 2007, the project received approval from Ian Bowles, the Massachusetts Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, as required by the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA). In October 2007, the Cape Cod Commission declined to approve Cape Wind without further study of the impact by the developers.\n\nOn June 20, 2008, the Barnstable Superior Court dismissed four of five counts against the MEPA certificate that had been filed by opposition groups and the Town of Barnstable. The fifth count was not considered ripe for a ruling since the matter was still pending before a state agency.\n\nOn May 22, 2009, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board issued a \"Super Permit\" to Cape Wind, overriding the Cape Cod Commission and obviating the need for any further state and local approvals.\n\nOn August 31, 2010, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled 4-2 that the state has the power to overrule community opposition and grant the Cape Wind project a suite of local permits it needs to start construction.\n\nOn 28 December 2011, a ruling by \"the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court gave its blessing to a novel power purchase agreement between Cape Wind and National Grid,\" as reported by the \"Boston Globe\", and in so doing \"the high court unanimously rejected criticisms by wind farm opponents of the state review’s of the agreement, under which National Grid will buy 50 percent of the wind farm’s power.\"\n\nAt the federal level, Cape Wind originally applied for a permit in 2001 under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 with the US Army Corps of Engineers. The Army Corps eventually presented a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In a public comment period, many Federal agencies, local governments, and community groups found the draft EIS to have deficiencies. Due to passage of the 2005 Energy Bill, the regulatory authority for off-shore energy projects has been transferred from the Army Corps to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) within the Department of the Interior. Whereas Cape Wind had expected to obtain approval quickly from the Army Corps, this transfer of authority to the MMS delayed the project.\n\nThe MMS issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in January 2008, and a Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) in January 2009.\n\nOn January 4, 2010, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called a meeting of principal parties to resolve remaining issues after the National Park Service ruled that Nantucket Sound is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its cultural and spiritual significance to two Native American tribes. \"After several years of review, it is now time to move the Cape Wind proposal to a final decision point. That is why I am gathering the principal parties together next week to consider the findings of the Keeper and to discuss how we might find a common-sense agreement on actions that could be taken to minimize and mitigate Cape Wind’s potential impacts on historic and cultural resources. I am hopeful that an agreement among the parties can be reached by March 1. If an agreement among the parties can’t be reached, I will be prepared to take the steps necessary to bring the permit process to conclusion. The public, the parties, and the permit applicants deserve certainty and resolution.\"\n\nOn March 22, 2010, a hearing was held before the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. Proponents and opponents of the plan delivered testimony during the hearing. The Council was to deliver their recommendations to Interior Secretary Salazar no later than April 14, 2010.\n\nOn April 28, 2010, at a news conference in the Massachusetts Statehouse alongside governor Deval Patrick, a supporter of the project, Secretary Salazar announced \"I am approving the Cape Wind project.\" The Preferred Alternative of Horseshoe Shoal was selected by the Record of Decision.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration cleared the construction of the wind farm on May 17, 2010 after raising concerns the wind turbine structures could cause interference with radar system at nearby Otis Air Force Base. Cape Wind agreed to fix the base's current system to ensure that it would not be affected by the wind farm. On 28 October 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the FAA's ruling. The court ordered the 'no hazard' determinations vacated and remanded back to the FAA. On August 15, 2012 Cape Wind received again full approval from the FAA. They determined that the wind farm would cause no danger to aircraft operations. However Cape Wind had begun its planning, even without all the federal approval.\n\nThe Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound filed a lawsuit in June 2010, claiming that federal approvals violated the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nOn October 6, 2010, Interior Secretary Salazar announced that a 28-year lease had been signed, which will cost Cape Wind an annual fee of $88,278 before construction, and a 2 to 7 percent variable operating fee during production, based on revenue from selling the energy.\n\nOn November 22, 2010, a 15-year Power Purchase Agreement between Cape Wind and National Grid was signed for 50% of the electricity, at a price of 18.7¢/kWh, adding $1.50 a month to the electricity bill of an average home.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, Cape Wind announced that it had received permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nOn April 18, 2011, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement granted its necessary approval for the project.\n\nIn Summer 2011, the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) filed a lawsuit against the federal government for allowing Cape Wind to move forward. Contradicting the Aquinnahs, the Pocasset Wampanoag Tribe had previously expressed support for the project.\n\nIn July 2016, an appeals court ruled that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had not obtained “sufficient site-specific data on seafloor\" as obligated by the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nCape Wind has signed a power purchase agreement with National Grid to sell half the project's output (i.e. about 750GW·h per year) for an initial price of 20.7 ¢/kW·h (later reduced to 18.7¢) — a price more than twice current retail rates (though increases in electrical prices in the winter of 2014 narrowed the difference significantly). The deal is subject to approval by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (PUC). In February 2012, NSTAR Utility agreed to a PPA equivalent of 129 MW capacity, a demand from PUC for allowing NSTAR and Northeast Utilities to complete a $4.8 billion merger. The second power purchase agreement with state utility NSTAR for 27.5 percent of the output has also been approved by Massachusetts regulators.\n\nIn January 2015, National Grid and Northeast Utilities cited Cape Wind's failure to obtain financing by December 31, 2014 as grounds for termination of their contract. National Grid spokesman Jake Navarro said the company was \"disappointed that Cape Wind has been unable to meet its commitments under the contract, resulting in today's termination of the power purchase agreement. According to Cape Wind, the terminations are invalid because of contract provisions that would extend the deadlines.\nAfter NStar and National Grid cancelled their contracts with Cape Wind, Cape Wind's leases with Quonset Development Corporation (for a port facility), Falmouth Harbor Marina (for headquarters), and New Bedford Marine Commerce (for staging and construction) were terminated. Additionally, Cape Wind was suspended by Independent System Operator/New England from participating in New England's wholesale electricity markets.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Cape Wind has been focused on its proposed location in Nantucket Sound. Because Cape Wind is positioning its project as a potential ecotourism destination, it has been criticized for disguising (or greenwashing) its industrial aspects.\n\nSupporters of the project, led by the non-profit grassroots organization Clean Power Now, cite wind's ability to displace oil and gas consumption with clean, locally produced energy and claim the project is the best option for much needed new generating capacity in the region. It would supply 75% of the average electrical needs of Cape Cod and the Islands. The Massachusetts Audubon Society conditionally endorsed the project in March 2006 as safe for birds, but asked for further studies.\n\nYear round and summer residents expressed concerns over the location of the project: some claim that the project will ruin scenic views from people's private property as well as views from public property such as beaches, as the turbines will be only 4.8 miles from the shore and therefore decrease property values, ruining popular areas for yachting, and cause other environmental problems. The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound has argued that Nantucket Sound is known worldwide for its wildlife and natural beauty.\n\nPhillip Scudder, owner of the Hy-Line ferry service on Cape Cod, originally opposed the project because he wondered how to navigate around the turbines when going to Martha's Vineyard, but changed its opposition to support due to the economic opportunity to provide \"eco-tours.\"\n\nWalter Cronkite drew attention when he came out against the wind farm; he later changed his opinion. Other opponents have included the late Senator Ted Kennedy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, former Gov. Mitt Romney, and businessman Bill Koch, who has donated $1.5 million to the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound.\n\nProponents suggest that some of this opposition is motivated in part by ownership of real-estate on Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard or the mainland and that it raises issues of environmental justice. Robert Kennedy, Jr., whose family's Kennedy Compound is within sight of the proposed wind farm, wrote an essay for the \"New York Times\" stating his support for wind power in general, but opposing this project. This doesn't represent the view of most Massachusetts citizens: in a 2005 survey, 81% of adults supported the project, 61% of Cape Cod residents supported it, and only 14% of adults oppose it.\n\nIn 2012, then-candidate for Congress Joseph Kennedy III, in a break with others in the Kennedy family, announced his support for the Cape Wind project.\n\nA 2007 book by Robert Whitcomb, Vice President and Editorial Page Editor of the \"Providence Journal,\" and Wendy Williams argues that the fight over Cape Wind involves a powerful, privileged minority imposing their will on the majority.\n\nIn 2014, a judge dismissed the 26th lawsuit against Cape Wind and commented \"There comes a point at which the right to litigate can become a vexatious abuse of the democratic process.\"\n\nIn January 2015, Ian Bowles, the Massachusetts Energy and Environment head, cited the recent breach of contract from Cape Wind as a reason the development is most likely abandoned, \"Presumably, this means the project will not move forward.\"\n\nCape Wind was an issue in the 2006 election for Governor of Massachusetts. The winner, Democrat Deval Patrick, supported the project; his Republican opponent, former Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey, opposed it.\n\nAn article by Grist.org on July 17, 2012. explained that Mitt Romney strongly opposed the Cape Wind project beginning in 2006. If elected Romney could have severely impacted the continuation of the project, set to begin building in 2013. William Koch, who largely opposes the Cape Wind project, was also a major contributor to Romney’s Presidential election, donating a record 2 million dollars.\n\nIn the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, Scott Brown, the Republican incumbent, opposed Cape Wind, while his Democratic challenger and the election winner, Elizabeth Warren supported the project.\n\nIn 2003 a documentary film entitled \"Wind Over Water\" about the controversy over the Cape Wind Project was released. The film by journalist Ole Tangen Jr. chronicled the debate as it unfolded on the Cape. An independent production, the filmmaker interviewed subjects from both sides of the debate including Jim Gordon, the driving force behind Cape Wind and Isaac Rosen, then director of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound. Focusing also on wind power in general, \"Wind Over Water\" features aerial footage of the offshore wind farm at Horns Rev in Denmark and footage from various wind farms in the U.S. On December 6, 2003 the film made its world and Cape Cod premiere at the Lillie Auditorium in Woods Hole.\n\nSatirical news correspondent Jason Jones of \"The Daily Show\" has also covered the Cape Wind project.\n\nA feature-length documentary about the Cape Wind project, entitled \"Cape Spin: An American Power Struggle\", had pre-release screenings in the summer of 2011.\n\nWendy Williams and Robert Whitcomb wrote a book about the project's history called \"Cape Wind: Money, Celebrity, Class, Politics and the Battle for Our Energy Future on Nantucket Sound.\" In an interview, one of the authors states that the fight over Cape Wind is a case of \"a very small group of people, with more money than most of us can possibly imagine, who decided from the very beginning [...] that they didn't want it there, it would upset their Martini time.\"\n\nA 2007 Opinion Research Corporation (ORC) survey of 600 state residents found that 93% of Massachusetts residents agree that the state should be \"a national leader in using cleaner and renewable energy on a large scale by moving ahead with offshore wind power\" and other clean energy initiatives. This statement is supported by 78 percent of those who live on the Cape and on the Islands.\n\nThe 2007 ORC survey also found that 84% of Massachusetts residents — including 58% of those who live on the Cape and on the Islands — explicitly support \"the proposed Cape Wind offshore wind farm that would involve wind turbines being placed in Nantucket Sound about five and a half miles from the Town of Hyannis.\" (A June 2006 survey posed the same question and found 81% support statewide and 61% in Cape Cod/the Islands.)\n\nIn 2007, 78% of Massachusetts residents surveyed — including 61% of those living on the Cape and on the Islands — support wind as the best energy resource to provide electricity to Cape Cod and the Islands. Statewide, the support for other alternatives was as follows: nuclear (10%); coal (4%); and other (5%).\n\nClean renewable energy is widely supported over nuclear power in Massachusetts, including on the Cape and on the Islands. Massachusetts residents would prefer to see solar power (91%), more energy conservation (90%), and wind power (89%) used first before resorting to more nuclear power. On the Cape and on the Islands, the views were very similar, with strong support for wind power (75%); conservation (81%); and solar (84%).\n\n2007 survey results were based on telephone interviews conducted among a sample of 600 householders aged 18 and over. Interviewing was completed by Opinion Research Corporation, for the Newton-based Civil Society Institute, during July and August 2007.\n\nDuring the November 4, 2008 election, 87% of voters in eleven Massachusetts towns on the south shore, near but not on the Cape, voted yes on Question 4, a non-binding question that read:\n\nThe measure was voted on by the towns of Braintree, Holbrook, Randolph, Cohasset, Hingham, Hull, Marshfield, Scituate, Hanover, Norwell, and Rockland.\n\nA 2009 poll by the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce showed 55% of its members oppose the project and 41% supported it.\n\nA 2010 poll by the \"Boston Globe\" said 69% of respondents supported Cape Wind, to 20% opposed. Further questions about cost showed that half of respondents said they would not support paying higher prices for the project's electricity. In general, however, many respondents said they would be in favor of paying higher rates if it meant getting electricity from cleaner sources. Forty-two percent said they would be willing to pay more, while 7 percent were unsure.\n\nIn 2011, \"Earlier this year, the Civil Society Institute commissioned an independent scientific survey of public opinion on Cape Wind that found 81% support in the State of Massachusetts and their sub-sample of Cape and Islands residents also found more support than opposition.\" The Civil Society Institute is a non profit, and non partisan company based in Newton, Mass.\n\nIn 2011 Mass Inc polling group hosted a poll \" The 80 percent Challenge: A Survey of Climate Change Opinion and Action in Massachusetts. Its findings showed \"when asked about future energy needs, large majorities said they would like to see more reliance on solar power (87%), wind power (86%), and natural gas (64%) far higher than levels who want to see more coal (21%), oil (14%) or nuclear power (31%).\" Further more, \"The survey showed, among many factors, strong support for renewable energy, with eight in ten residents willing to pay an extra one dollar, and 60 percent saying they’d pay up to 5 dollars more for renewable energy over traditional sources like oil or coal.\"\n\nA 2013 survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center polled 503 MA residents about the Cape Wind project. More respondents opposed the project than supported it and 50% thought it should be halted. Nearly two-thirds want utilities to buy less expensive power instead of more expensive renewable sources.\n\nIn 2010, the Massachusetts Attorney General's office estimated that Cape Wind would ultimately cost $2.5 billion. Monetary costs of the electricity generated by the project are estimated to be double the 2010 price of traditional fossil fuels.\n\nIn 2014, the Republican side of the House voted to block a $150 million loan guarantee for Cape Wind, acknowledging that the block was narrowly targeted. The block may not be effective, as an agreement may be reached before the block comes into place. The project has a $600 million loan guarantee from the Danish export credit agency (their biggest ever) and another $200 million from PensionDanmark, and the combined funding amounted to $1.45 billion.\n\nAccording to a report in the \"Boston Globe\", May 24, 2006, Jay M. Cashman, owner of a large construction company that built part of the Big Dig, proposed to build a $750 million wind farm in Buzzards Bay, about west of the proposed Cape Wind site. The Cashman farm would be closer (2 mi) to shore and would consist of 120 turbines, each tall. The projected generation capacity is 300 MW. According to the \"Globe\", some opponents of the Cape Wind project have expressed interest in the Cashman plan.\n\nIn February, 2008, state law was amended removing a prohibition on the construction of electrical generating facilities within ocean sanctuaries.\n\n\n\n"}

It was replaced by new product line, ArcGIS, in 2000. Regardless of it being discontinued and replaced, some users still find the software useful and hold the opinion it is a superior product for some tasks.\n\nArcView started as a graphical program for spatial data and maps made using ESRI's other software products. In subsequent versions, more functionality was added to ArcView and it became a true GIS program capable of complex analysis and data management. The simple GUI was preferred by many over the less user friendly, more powerful ARC/INFO that was primarily used from a Command-line interface.\n\nArcView 1.0 was released in 1991 to provide access to GIS for non-traditional users of the technology. ESRI's flagship professional GIS at the time, Arc/INFO, was based on a command line interface and was not accessible to users that only needed view and query capability. The release did not support Shapefiles at the time.\n\nArcView 1 was very popular, and ESRI promised a more functional 2.x version of the product. This product was developed using a multi-platform windowing environment called Neuron Data, which allowed the product to be supported on the increasingly popular Windows 95 and Windows 2000, UNIX, and Mac OS 9 platforms. This product, when finally released (18 months after its initial release date) was very successful for ESRI and brought GIS technology to many people who had not used it before.\n\nArcView 3.x included even more full-featured GIS functionality, including a geoprocessing wizard and full support of extensions for raster and 3d processing. It was eventually renamed \"ArcView GIS\" by ESRI.\n\nIn 1997, ESRI released its final version supporting Mac OS 9 (3.0a). It is still available, although it only runs on older (PowerPC-based) Mac systems, under Mac OS 9.\n\nThe last release of ArcView GIS was version 3.3 (May 22, 2002), and was offered for both Unix and Windows variants.\n\nIt can be copied from an existing installation on a Windows XP machine to Vista, Windows 7 and 8 (search Esri Forums for Instructions).\n\nYou can also install it normally using the InstallShield 3 Setup Engine (Is3Engine.zip). The Setup Launcher for ArcView is a 16-bit application and not supported by 64 bit systems. However the InstallShield Engine is 32-bit and will run on a 64 bit system. Using the Is3Engine(File Name: setup32.exe) with its compatibility set to Windows XP SP3, Placed in a WRITABLE folder with the rest of your application install files and run instead of the original setup file (File Name: setup.exe) will allow the software to be installed on a Windows 7 or 8 64 bit system in the normal way. To have the ArcView Help files work you will need download and install WinHlp32.exe from Microsoft.\n\nMany GIS professionals and users still use ArcView 3 even though it has been discontinued and replaced by a new product line. Some users with access to ArcGIS 9.x or 10.x may still install and use ArcView 3.x.\n\nArcView 3.x offers various advantages over ArcGIS including faster start up, faster functions such as dissolve, spatial joins and summary functions executed on the tabular data. Some users also strongly prefer having the ability to promote selected records in the tables instead of simply hiding un-selected records as ArcGIS offers. Small scale overlays and spatial joins with basic map/layout creation that tends to be the only tasks done by students are done quicker. Independent consultants, small businesses and organizations may not be able to justify the expense of moving to ArcGIS and the need to maintain annual licenses. Availability of free open source scripts and extensions created by users using the built-in object oriented scripting language Avenue is another reason.\n\n\n"}

He was a third round draft choice of the Dallas Cowboys in the 1997 NFL Draft, out of Division I-AA school Appalachian State. Coakley was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011 making him Appalachian State's first inductee.\n\nCoakley graduated from Wando High School, where he earned four letters in football. He was the team's Most Valuable Player twice and was twice named all-conference as a safety, after posting 295 tackles in his final two years. \n\nHe was a very productive running back, rushing for over 2,000 yards his junior and senior years.\nHe also lettered in wrestling.\n\nIn order to meet academic requirements for College, Coakley attended Fork Union Military Academy post-graduate program for one year, before accepting a scholarship to Appalachian State University.\n\nWhile at Appalachian State University he grew bigger and was switched to linebacker, becoming the first two-time winner of the Buck Buchanan Awards, given each year to the nation's top Division I-AA defensive player. He was a critical part of the defense on the 1995 Mountaineer team that finished the season unbeaten and untied.\n\nCoakley was named All-American and Southern Conference Defensive Player of the Year as a sophomore, junior and senior, becoming the first player ever to accomplish this feat. He was also the Southern Conference's Athlete of the Year as a junior and senior, marking just the seventh time in conference history that one individual had earned that distinction in consecutive years.\n\nHis numerous accolades include being second all-time in tackles in Southern Conference history and breaking the all-time solo tackles (616) and sacks records at Appalachian State University, where his jersey number is retired. He earned a degree in communications and advertising.\n\nIn 2011, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame and the Southern Conference Hall of Fame.\n\nCoakley was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (65th overall) of the 1997 NFL Draft, after dropping because he was considered an undersized linebacker with a small college background.\n\nHe became the starter at weakside linebacker as a rookie in preseason, after competing with second-year player Alan Campos and would never relinquish the position, registering 136 tackles, 10 tackles for loss (led the team), one interception and one fumble returned for a touchdown. At the end of the season, he was named to the NFL All-Rookie team. His speed and athleticism allowed him to become a playmaker in Cowboys defenses that were built around speed and pursuit.\n\nIn 1999, he made 131 tackles and intercepted four passes, becoming the first Cowboys linebacker to go to the Pro Bowl since Ken Norton Jr. in 1993. Coakley also received the NFL's \"All Iron MVP\" award during that year's Thanksgiving Day game.\n\nIn the 90's, the Cowboys organization felt they could find linebackers through the draft, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players like Ken Norton Jr., Darrin Smith, Dixon Edwards, Robert Jones and Randall Godfrey, to leave via free agency, instead of signing them into long-term contracts. This philosophy ended when the Cowboys re-signed Coakley to a six-year contract extension in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, he led the team with 173 tackles. While Coakley started all 16 games in 2004, he shared significant time with second year linebacker Bradie James, finishing the year with a career-low 91 tackles (60 solo), ending a streak of seven consecutive 100-tackle seasons. He also had 6 quarterback pressures and 5 passes defensed. At the end of the 2004 season he was released because of salary cap considerations and a switch to a 3–4 defense, which is designed for bigger and taller linebackers.\n\nHis string of seven consecutive 100-tackle seasons is a franchise record. In addition, he reached double figures in tackles 37 times in 95 career regular season games. He earned Pro Bowl honors in 1999, 2001 and 2003.\n\nDuring his eight seasons with the Cowboys, he was a very durable player starting 127 out of 128 games, his only missed game was midway through the 2001 season because of a sprained knee. Coakley is tied with Dennis Thurman for the club record for defensive touchdowns with five, coming on fumble (one) and interception (four) returns. He is the fourth leading tackler in franchise history with 1,046.\n\nOne day after being released by the Cowboys, he was signed to a five-year contract, by the St. Louis Rams for nearly double the salary he was getting in Dallas, with a signing bonus of $14 million. Coakley was a starter in 2005, registering 42 tackles, two sacks, and one interception in 12 games for the Rams, before suffering a season-ending fractured fibula and a dislocated ankle.\n\nIn 2006, he finished with 37 tackles and two interceptions as a backup, starting five games in place of the injured starter Pisa Tinoisamoa. He was released by the Rams in 2007.\n\nHe is now the linebackers coach at The Oakridge School in Arlington, Texas, along with fellow former NFL player Carlos Francis. He is also the Softball coach at Oakridge. His first year coaching the team won the Division II championships in the Southwest Preparatory Conference.\n"}
{"id": "2046810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046810", "title": "ThinBasic", "text": "ThinBasic\n\nthinBasic is a BASIC-like computer programming language interpreter with a central core engine architecture surrounded by many specialized modules. Although originally designed mainly for computer automation, thanks to its modular structure it can be used for wide range of tasks.\n\nAs the name suggests, the biggest influence on the syntax of this language was the BASIC language. But, unlike traditional BASICs, as known from the 8-bit era, thinBASIC does differ in few important points.\n\nFor example, it requires the programmer to declare variables and it does not feature the infamous GOTO and GOSUB statements. Some aspects of the syntax are even inspired in non-BASIC languages, such as C/C++. Thanks to this, thinBASIC optionally allows use of implicit line continuation, simplified addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators, shortened variable declaration and initialization:\n\n' Traditional syntax allowed in thinBASIC\nDIM a AS INTEGER ' a is initialized to 0\na = 1 ' a now contains 1\na = a + 1 ' a now contains 2\n\n' C/C++ inspired syntax allowed in thinBASIC\nINTEGER a = 1 ' a is initialized to 1\na += 1 ' a now contains 2\n\n' New syntax introduced in 1.9.10.0 allows defining type from string expression\nSTRING sType = \"INTEGER\"\nDIM a LIKE sType \nAnother source of inspiration are the modern versions of BASIC, such as Visual Basic or PowerBASIC.\n\nThinBASIC does offer the main flow control statements, such as SELECT CASE, IF ... THEN/ELSEIF/ELSE/END IF, loops (infinite, conditional, FOR, WHILE/WEND, DO/LOOP WHILE ..., DO/LOOP UNTIL ...) and it also puts very strong effort on providing wide range of built-in functions for number crunching and especially string handling.\n\nThinBASIC supports a wide range of numeric and string data types.\n\nBesides those mentioned in the table above, a programmer can define pointers, user-defined types and unions.\n\nThe special features related to user-defined types in thinBASIC are:\n\nVariables can be defined in global, local or static scope.\nThinBASIC supports arrays of up to three dimensions.\n\nThe elemental functionality of the language is provided by the so-called \"Core\" module, which is loaded by default, and takes care of parsing too.\n\nBesides the Core module, thinBASIC offers other modules, each covering a specific area of functionality, for example:\n\nEach module is represented by single DLL, with specific structure. This allows the module to contain not just typical functions and procedures, but also for example constants and user-defined types definitions, immediately available for script without need for header file. The only thing needed is to explicitly mention the usage of module in the code – for file handling it would look like:\n\n' This loads the module for use\nUses \"File\"\n\n' Function File_Load comes from the module, it returns the content of passed file in form of String\nString sBuffer = File_Load(\"C:\\text.txt\") \nTo better structure the code, thinBASIC provides the functions and procedures functionality. There is one function with special treatment, called TBMAIN, which is guaranteed to be executed first. It represents the same function as main() function in C programming language, but its use is optional.\n\nA programmer can define custom functions and procedures (called Subs); they can have up to 32 parameters. Both functions and procedures do not need to be declared before use. Parameters can be marked as optional, and they can also be initialized to default values. Each parameter can be specified to be passed by value (default) or by reference.\n\nUses \"Console\"\n\n' Program body starts in TBMain function\nFunction TBMain()\n\nEnd Function\n\n' User defined function with optional parameters with default values\nFunction MyFunction( a As Number, Optional b As Number = 20, c As Number = 30)\n\nEnd Function\nThe functions can be called directly, as in the listing above, or by composing their name at run-time.\n\nThinBASIC supports calling functions from third-party DLLs; programmer needs to declare them first to be able to access the functionality.\n\nThanks to this mechanism, thinBASIC allows using technologies such as OpenGL, OpenCL, XML, ODE and many others.\n\nThinBASIC does not support any form of project files at the moment, but it encourages splitting code to units by providing multiple file extensions for different use:\n\nThe main code can reference these files using #include directive, which can use wildcards:\n\n\n\nFunction TBMain()\n\nEnd Function\nThe language can be enhanced by module development using SDK for many languages (PowerBASIC, FreeBASIC, C, MASM).\n\nThe development team puts strong focus on documentation of the language and on the learning resources. The language itself is documented in extensive help file and the default installation contains tutorial and much example code too.\n\nVarious articles on use of thinBASIC have been published in form of \"ThinBasic Journal\" and on the homepage of the programming language as well (please see external links).\n\nThinBASIC comes with own IDE, called thinAir, in the default installation.\nIt offers:\n\nthinAir allows using the debugger as well.\nThis component is called thinDebug and can be watched on the image linked below.\n\nConsole program, which asks user about name and then greets him:\n\n' Specifies program will use functions from console module\nuses \"Console\"\n\n' TBMain represents main body of the program\nfunction TBMain()\n\nend function \nThinBASIC was designed for the Windows platform and this is why it makes a good use of resources provided by this system, such as registry, user interface, work with processes, COM, DLLs. Although interpreted, thinBASIC is considered to have usually fast execution. When the interpreter nature of the language hits the limits, it is possible to perform optimizations using partial JIT compilation. Another strength of the language is a wide range of commands covering various areas of interest and for BASIC traditionally - strong focus on string handling. The language is under continuous development and maintenance.\n\nThe fact that thinBASIC is designed for Windows only can be seen as disadvantage as well, for those who seek cross-platform tools. The speed of execution without the use of optimizations is lower compared to output of compilers, thanks to language interpreter nature.\n\nthinBASIC has been developed under Microsoft Windows XP Professional using PowerBASIC, and requires Internet Explorer version 5.50 or above.\n\n\n"}

The stadium is located next to the Webster Bank Arena. It was named \"Harbor Yard\" as an allusion to Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nLocated on Bridgeport's Long Island Sound waterfront, Harbor Yard is encircled by Interstate 95 and the Northeast Corridor rail line. The site has navigable ingress and egress routes to northern Fairfield County and the Naugatuck River Valley via the 8/25 connector. The city chose not to renew its lease to the Bluefish and closed the stadium after the 2017 baseball season to convert it to an outdoor amphitheater; the Atlantic League relocated its club to High Point, North Carolina.\n\nThe Ballpark at Harbor Yard opened on May 21, 1998 on the site of the former Jenkins Valve factory. The demolition of the Pequonnock apartment buildings in 2002 improved the parking situation for fans attending games at the Ballpark. The Ballpark and Webster Bank Arena are credited for revitalizing the city into a prosperous waterfront attraction and destination.\n\nThe Ballpark at Harbor Yard was constructed in between 1997 and 1998, and its $19 million price tag was funded through public and team contributions. It has a seating capacity of 5,500. Believing that Harbor Yard would be one of the important pieces of Bridgeport's renewal, team co-founder, Jack McGregor, chose its name as an allusion to Baltimore's renewal of the Camden Yards neighborhood.\n\nHarbor Yard was the home field of the Bridgeport Barrage of Major League Lacrosse from 2001 to 2003. The Barrage relocated to Philadelphia after the 2003 season.\n\nOn October 1, 2009 the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball granted the ballpark the 2009 Atlantic League Park of the Year award.\n\nOn August 8, 2017, Mayor Joe Ganim announced that city would not renew the Bluefish's lease, ending their 20-year stint at the ballpark at the end of the 2017 season. The ballpark is expected to be converted to a concert venue, hosting 29 events a year. The Bluefish played their final home game at the park on September 17, 2017, losing by a score of 9–2 to the Somerset Patriots. A groundbreaking ceremony for the replacement amphitheater was held in July 2018, with opening predicted for the summer of 2019. The opening date has since been pushed back to summer 2020.\n\nThe Ballpark at Harbor Yard hosted four All-Star games in its history: the first MLL All-Star Game in 2001, and the 1999, 2006 and 2015 Atlantic League All Star games.\n\nThe park had concessions with traditional ballpark fare served at two restaurants: the People's Bank Marina, an all-you-can-eat buffet; and the Harbor Club, a restaurant that served an upscale ballpark menu.\n\nChildren at the ballpark could play on the playground equipment at the United Way Kids' Cove. There was also a party suite was for birthday parties and other special occasions.\n\nThe Bluefish added the Two Roads Beer Garden for the 2015 season, sponsored by the Two Roads Brewery from Stratford.\n\n\n"}

It stars George Hamilton, Susan Saint James, Richard Benjamin and Arte Johnson. The original music score was composed by Charles Bernstein. The film's tagline is: \"Your favorite pain in the neck is about to bite your funny bone!\"\n\nThe infamous vampire Count Dracula is expelled from his castle by the Communist government of Romania, which plans to convert the structure into a training facility for gymnasts (including Nadia Comăneci). The world-weary Count travels to New York City with his bug-eating manservant, Renfield, and establishes himself in a hotel, but only after a mix-up at the airport causes his coffin to be accidentally sent to be the centerpiece in a funeral at a black church in Harlem. While Dracula learns that America contains such wonders as blood banks, sex clubs, and discotheques, he also proceeds to suffer the general ego-crushing that comes from life in the Big Apple in the late 1970s as he romantically pursues flaky fashion model Cindy Sondheim, whom he has admired from afar and believes to be the current reincarnation of his true love (an earlier being named Mina Harker).\n\nDracula is ineptly pursued in turn by Sondheim's psychiatrist and quasi-boyfriend Jeffrey Rosenberg. Jeffrey is the grandson of Dracula's old nemesis Fritz van Helsing but changed his name to Rosenberg \"for professional reasons\". Rosenberg's numerous methods to combat Dracula – mirrors, garlic, a Star of David (which he uses instead of the cross), and hypnosis – are easily averted by the Count. Rosenberg also tries burning Dracula's coffin with the vampire still inside, but is arrested by hotel security. Subsequently he tries to shoot him with three silver bullets, but Dracula remains unscathed, patiently explaining that this works only on werewolves. Rosenberg's increasingly erratic actions eventually cause him to be locked up as a lunatic, but as mysterious cases of blood-bank robberies and vampiric attacks begin to spread, NYPD Lieutenant Ferguson starts to believe the psychiatrist's claims and gets him released.\n\nIn the end, as a major blackout hits the city, Dracula flees via taxi cab back to the airport with Cindy, pursued by Rosenberg and Ferguson. The coffin is accidentally sent to Jamaica instead of London and the couple miss their plane. On the runway, Cindy finally agrees to become Dracula's vampire bride. Rosenberg attempts to stake Dracula, but as he moves in for the kill, the two fly off as bats together. A check drops down by which Cindy pays off her (enormous) psychiatry bill to Rosenberg, to which he remarks: \"She has become a responsible person ... or whatever.\" Rosenberg keeps Dracula's cape – the only thing his stake had hit – which Ferguson borrows, hoping (since the cape makes the wearer look stylish) it will help him on his wedding anniversary. The last scene shows Dracula and Cindy, transformed into bats, on their way to Jamaica.\n\nThe inspiration for the film came about while George Hamilton was entertaining screenwriter Robert Kaufman with poolside impressions of Bela Lugosi, and thoughts turned to what would happen if Dracula lived in modern New York City. A script was financed for $100,000 and later acquired by Melvin Simon, a shopping-mall entrepreneur with an interest in films. Director Stan Dragoti became attached to the project through Peter Sellers, an acquaintance of Kaufman.\n\nThe film was a financial success, earning about $44 million against a $3 million budget and ranking at number 13 on a list of the top grossing films of 1979. It was AIP's highest-grossing film until the release of \"The Amityville Horror\" later in the year, and was one of the highest-grossing independent films for many years. However, critical reviews were mixed, and \"Love at First Bite\" has a 67% \"Fresh\" rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 21 reviews.\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" described \"Love\" as \"[a] coarse, delightful little movie with a bang-up cast and no pretensions at all,\" while Dave Kehr lamented the film's \"hodgepodge of flat one-liners and graceless slapstick.\" \"Variety\" noted a \"tendency to lurch from joke to joke\" and observed that the story may be \"silly,\" but Hamilton \"makes it work. In the first place, he's funny just to watch.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film zero stars out of four, writing that Hamilton \"has no idea how to play comedy\" and gave \"a smug performance in a film full of tired jokes and some of the most cruel racial stereotyping you'll ever see.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"It is not quite the coupling of the decade, and Ms. St. James, although sympathetic, looks occasionally distracted, as if she were expecting a phone call at any minute. But Hamilton, baying 'Children of de night, shawt opp' at the baying wolves outside, has all the energy the movie needs. His characterization, grandly sweeping, sincere, preposterous but solemn, is just right.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" suggested that the film \"was evidently contrived by funnymen who started to run short of gags right after thinking up the title,\" also observing that Susan Saint James \"doesn't even seem to be trying\" and that \"Hamilton does an acceptable vocal impression of Bela Lugosi, but the act may have been more amusing when he was just doing it for friends.\" Tom Milne of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" compared the film to the work of Mel Brooks and opined that it had \"fewer belly-laughs than \"Young Frankenstein\"\" but was \"more consistent in its humour, partly because it pays more attention to character ... but chiefly because it adheres to its aim of producing 'a comedic Dracula, rather than a comical one.'\"\n\nThe movie has been released on VHS from Orion Home Video in 1993, Warner Bros Pictures on June 16, 1993, and DVD from MGM on July 12, 2005. On the VHS and DVD versions, the song played during the disco scene, \"I Love the Nightlife\" by Alicia Bridges has been removed and replaced by a different song. Shout! Factory released the film in February 2015 for the first time on Blu-ray Disc (with the original disco song intact) as a double feature with Once Bitten, with the audio enhanced to 5.1 surround sound.\n\nHamilton purchased the film's copyright from Melvin Simon Productions and has been very eager to make a sequel. In 2009, he stated:\n\nIt's terrific. It's all about old world school of Dracula in the Bela Lugosi 1940s up against the Twilight felons with humor, It's hard to do but it's great fun. I think 'Twilight' is a wonderful series of books. It's so important for these young girls with hormonal changes and this love that's worth giving your life for. But now I have to find a way to bring my 'Love At First Bite' character into that kind of story and make it funny and not be at all like 'Twilight' and I think I found a way to do that.\n\nHe later elaborated about the plot:\n\nHis [my character's] son is a sort of perennial student in California and he doesn't want to acknowledge his father, Dracula, at all and he's getting married into a family of televangelists. {Laughs} He met this girl that he's in love with who's a zoologist in a cave somewhere; he was a bat in this cave in South America. So now, Dracula's forced himself to come to Hollywood for this big wedding and bring all of his relatives who are pretty ridiculous people. There's a wonderful scene at the bachelor party in a strip club, it's great stuff.\n\nTo date, a sequel has yet to go into production.\n\n\n"}

He won numerous national trophies with the club sides of Flamengo, Botafogo, São Paulo and Fluminense. He is widely known as being \"the brain\" behind the Brazilian Football Team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico.\n\nGérson was born and spent his childhood in the city of Niterói, just to the eastern side of Guanabara Bay from Rio de Janeiro, then the capital of the former Rio de Janeiro State. In school he was nicknamed \"papagaio\" (parrot), a nickname he kept throughout his life and which many of his fellow footballers used when addressing him.\n\nBoth his father and uncle were professional footballers in Rio. His father was a close friend of the legendary Zizinho, widely held as the best Brazilian footballer before Pelé, a superstar with Flamengo and a forward in the 1950 national team, along with Vasco da Gama's Ademir Menezes and Flamengo's Jair da Rosa Pinto. So when Gérson announced he intended to become a footballer himself, he found little opposition at home.\n\nAs a boy his heroes had been the aforementioned midfielders Zizinho and Jair and Vasco da Gama's Danilo Alvim. However, in his first club, Flamengo, he was eventually cast in the same mold as the most influential midfield player of that era, Didi. The young Gérson combined technique and an extremely potent left foot shot with intelligence and an uncanny ability to control the game from the midfield. One of his greatest assets was his ability to switch defence into attack with one long, laser-like pass from deep inside his own half. Soon he was being talked of as a successor to Didi.\n\nWithin a year of making his professional debut for Flamengo in 1959, he was called to the Brazilian ‘amateur’ team in the Pan-American Games in Chicago. A year later he was a lynchpin of the side at the Rome Olympics where he scored four goals, but Brazil did not make it beyond the group phase. By 1961, he was the playmaker in Flamengo. He had also been recruited into the full national squad to defend the World Cup in Chile by the new national coach Aymore Moreira. Yet his dreams of combining with the bandy-legged ‘Little Bird’ Garrincha, along with Pelé and Didi in Chile were dashed when he suffered a serious knee injury. Forced to undergo surgery, he couldn’t get himself back into Moreira’s squad. It would be one of many injuries to blight his career.\n\nIn 1963 he chose not to sign another contract with Flamengo after being assigned the impossible task of man-marking Garrincha in the 1962 Rio de Janeiro Championship final, which Botafogo won 3–0. He packed his bags and moved to Botafogo, which by then had the most celebrated squad in Rio and arguably in Brazil, alongside Pelé's Santos, featuring superstars Garrincha, Didi, Nilton Santos, Zagallo and Quarentinha. In Botafogo he became one of the most celebrated Brazilian players of his generation, winning the Torneio Rio-São Paulo in 1964 and 1965, the Rio de Janeiro Championship in 1967 and 1968 and with the Brazilian Cup in 1968 in two finals against Fortaleza the first national honour in the history of Botafogo.\n\nLater on, he also played for São Paulo and Fluminense, his favourite team.\n\nGérson is considered one of the best passers in World Cup history. Although he didn't play well in 1966, he was the mastermind behind the whole Brazilian national team in the 1970 tournament. He is regarded as the best passer and midfielder in that edition of that World Cup, in that Brazilian squad, and the best player in the 4–1 victory against Italy in the final. Overall, he played 70 times for Brazil, scoring 14 goals for his country, including one in that 1970 World Cup final.\n\nOutside the soccer pitch, Gérson's name became nationally infamous after he starred in a Vila Rica cigarettes' advertising campaign for television in 1976, which had him read the tagline \"\"I like to take advantage of everything, right? You too take advantage!\"\". The line became instantly associated with the traditional Brazilian disregard for laws and social rules as well as bribery and corruption maneuvers, informally named \"\"jeitinho brasileiro\"\" (\"the Brazilian way\"), and the expression is largely used to these days. He later publicly regretted having starred in the ad, claiming his association with such acts did not reflect his true personality.\n\nAlthough Gérson played as a holding midfielder, Jonathan Wilson noted in a 2013 article for \"The Guardian\" that he was an early example of a more creative interpreter of this role, who focussed more on ball retention and passing rather than solely looking to win back possession. A tactically intelligent, efficient, and technically gifted midfield playmaker, he was considered the \"brain\" behind the Brazilian squad that won the 1970 World Cup. He was known for his ability to retain possession and dictate the tempo of his team's play in midfield with his precise passing, and was also capable of switching from defence to attack by playing sudden, accurate long balls to meet his teammates' runs; he is regarded as one of the best passers in the history of the sport, and as one of Brazil's greatest ever players. He also possessed an excellent positional sense, and a powerful shot with his left foot, which earned him the nickname \"Canhotinha de Ouro\" (\"Golden left foot,\" in Portuguese).\n\nGérson displayed anger towards Pele's list. He was adamant with the ruling and thought that he and a few of his teammates deserved a spot on the list. He symbolically ripped up a piece of paper, a clear representation of Pele's list, on a local broadcasting station saying that \"\"I respect his opinion, but I don't agree. Apart from Zidane, Platini, and Fontaine, I'm behind 11 Frenchmen? It's a joke to hear this.\"\"\n\n\nFlamengo\n\nBotafogo\n\nSão Paulo\n\nBrazil\n\n\n"}

The term is used in contrast to the \"ordinary\", which is that part of the liturgy that is reasonably constant, or at least selected without regard to date, or to the \"common\", which contains those parts of the liturgy that are common to an entire category of saints, such as apostles or martyrs.\n\nPropers may include hymns and prayers in the canonical hours and in the Eucharist.\n\nThe proper of the mass, strictly speaking, consists of the Introit, Gradual, Alleluia or Tract, Sequence, Offertory, and Communion - in other words, all the variable portions of a mass which are spoken or sung by the choir or the people. These are sometimes called the \"minor propers\" to distinguish them from the collect, secret, postcommunion, and readings - in other words, all the variable portions of a mass which are spoken or sung by the priest or other attendants, such as a lector or deacon. In Roman Catholic and Anglo-Catholic practice, there is a moveable portion of the service that, strictly speaking, does not form part of the proper known as the Accentus. Portions of the Accentus are often referred to as part of the \"proper\" if they satisfy the criteria of changing by date (such as the Preface and Epistle).\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite, the propers are numerous and are drawn from a large collection of liturgical books, including the Euchologion, Horologion, Octoechos, and Menaion. During the ten-week period of Lent, propers are also drawn from the Lenten Triodion, and during the eight weeks after Easter, from the Pentecostarion. There are certain other books of propers as well for more specific applications, such as the Theotokarion.\n\nThe Typikon describes how the propers are to be used—and when commemorations overlap, how the propers are to be combined and which propers may suppress others. Each local jurisdiction has slightly different methods for laying out their services, but the following table outlines the basic propers for the services of the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic churches.\n"}

The LEGO Corporation gave Libera the bricks for free without a clear vision of Libera's project and not knowing he would use them for this purpose.

Critics charged that Libera's sets trivialize the Holocaust. Defenders argue, however, that the LEGO sets mirror the evil-minded ingenuity required to construct the concentration camps as instruments of terror. Art historical criticism, like that proposed by Ernst van Alphen, has argued that the toys seek to represent and refigure the Holocaust in a more familiar register that recovers its meaning from overbearing Holocaust education programs.

He was followed by Lord Soulbury, thereafter by Sir Oliver Goonetilleke the first Ceylonese to be appointed to the post. When William Gopallawa was appointed as Governor-General in 1962, he discarded the ceremonial uniform of office.\n\nWhen Ceylon became a republic in 1972 the post was replaced by the office of President of Sri Lanka.\n\nThe monarch, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appointed a governor-general to be his/her representative in Ceylon. Neither the monarch nor the Governor-General had any direct role in the day-today administration of the country (however, both possessed reserve powers under the constitution which would allow them full control of the nation's governance whenever in their opinion a case of emergency requiring such action arises). Real legislative and executive responsibilities rested with the elected representatives of the people. During several periods when a state of emergency was declared the Governor-General used his reserved powers.

It consisted of 52 story arcs that were syndicated in British newspapers, seven of which were initially published abroad.\n\nIn 1957, the \"Daily Express\", a newspaper owned by Lord Beaverbrook, approached Ian Fleming about adapting his James Bond stories as comic strips. Fleming was then reluctant, because he felt the comic strips would lack the quality of his writing, potentially hurting his spy novel series while he was still writing. Fleming wrote:\n\nRegardless, Fleming later agreed, and to aid the \"Daily Express\" in illustrating James Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to sketch whom he believed James Bond to look like. The assigned illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 appeared too \"outdated\" and \"pre-war\", and thus changed James Bond to a more rugged and masculine appearance.\n\nThe first strip, \"Casino Royale\", was published in 1958. The story was adapted by Anthony Hern, who previously had serialised \"Diamonds Are Forever\" and \"From Russia with Love\" for the \"Daily Express\". The majority of the early comic strips were adapted by Henry Gammidge (other than the \"Dr. No\" adaptation, 1960, by Peter O'Donnell, years before he launched his strip \"Modesty Blaise\"). McLusky later would illustrate twelve more James Bond comic strips with partner Gammidge until 1966.\n\nIn 1962 the \"Daily Express\" abruptly cancelled their agreement with Ian Fleming when Lord Beaverbrook and Fleming disputed the rights to the James Bond short story \"The Living Daylights\". Fleming had sold the rights to the \"Sunday Times\", a rival newspaper — upsetting Beaverbrook into terminating his business relationship with Fleming. The dispute abruptly ended the comic strip adaptation of \"Thunderball\". Additional panels were added later for its syndication to other newspapers, and to expand and conclude the story. Beaverbrook and Fleming later settled their differences, and the comic strip serial would continue in 1964 with \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\".\n\nIn 1966 Yaroslav Horak replaced John McLusky as the artist for the \"Daily Express\" comic strip series and adapted six more Ian Fleming James Bond novels and short stories as well as Kingsley Amis' \"Colonel Sun\" with partner Jim Lawrence. \"The Living Daylights\" was also republished in the \"Daily Express\" after first appearing in the first edition of the \"Sunday Times\" magazine on February 4, 1962 and in the American magazine \"Argosy\" in June of the same year under the title \"Berlin Escape\".\n\nWith the success of \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" Horak and Lawrence subsequently went on to write and illustrate twenty original James Bond comic strips for the \"Daily Express\" after being granted permission by Ian Fleming's Trust.\n\nIn 1977 the \"Daily Express\" discontinued their series of Bond comic strips, although Horak and Lawrence went on to write and illustrate several other James Bond adventures for syndication abroad in Europe, for the \"Sunday Express\" (the Sunday edition of the \"Daily Express\"), and the \"Daily Star\". Additionally, John McLusky returned to team up with Jim Lawrence for five comic strips. One strip, \"Doomcrack\", featured artwork by Harry North, who at the time worked for \"MAD Magazine\" on its film parodies.\n\nThe 1983 strip \"Polestar\" was abruptly terminated by the \"Daily Star\" midway through its run and was not completed, although the complete story did appear in non-UK newspapers and was followed by several more complete serials before the James Bond comic strip officially came to an end.\n\nSince first publication in the \"Daily Express\", the comic strip adaptations have been reprinted several times. First by the James Bond 007 International Fan Club, in the early 1980s. Then annually, from 1987 to 1990, by the British Titan Books company in anthologies, beginning with \"The Living Daylights\" to tie-in with the release of the eponymous James Bond film.\n\n\nBeginning in 2004, Titan reissued these anthologies in larger, revised editions, and also began reprinting stories that hadn't been featured in the earlier books. With a more frequent publishing schedule than the first series, all 52 stories had been published in seventeen books by March 2010. These volumes include new introductory chapters on the history of the strip and the Bond novels, and most of the books have also included special introductions written by Bond film actors, specifically Caroline Munro (\"The Spy Who Loved Me\"), George Lazenby (\"OHMSS\"), Shirley Eaton (\"Goldfinger\"), Eunice Gayson (\"Dr. No\"), Roger Moore (\"Casino Royale\"), Maud Adams (\"Octopussy\"), Britt Ekland (\"Colonel Sun\"), and Richard Kiel (\"The Golden Ghost\"). Titan's comic strip reprints were not initially published in the strips' original publication order; this changed as of the release of \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" volume.\n\n\n\"The Harpies\", included in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", is the first non-Fleming-based Bond comic strip to be reprinted as well as the first original story. \"River of Death\", in the \"Colonel Sun\" collection, is the second original story to be published (\"Colonel Sun\" itself being an adaptation of the first post-Fleming Bond novel). \"The Golden Ghost\" is the first collection comprising all-original stories.\n\nThe collection \"The Phoenix Project\" indicates that the July 2007 release was to have been \"Nightbird\", but this was not published as scheduled. The \"Nightbird\" collection eventually saw print in March 2010 and is considered the final release in the Titan series as all \"Daily Express\"-related strips have now been reprinted.\n\nFrom September 2009 to November 2014 larger volumes called 'Omnibus' editions were released containing more stories in each volume.\n\n\nFrom November 2015 a series of hardcover collections was released containing up to six stories in each volume.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Its population was 10,568 as of 2011, and it occupies the southwestern part of the island. It is the only parish to border only one other parish, St. Peter. The parish is the second-largest parish by surface area, covering 7,103 vergées (3,157 acres or 12.78 km²), which is 11% of the total land surface of the island.\n\nIts name is derived from a 6th-century Celtic or Welsh \"wandering saint\" named Branwalator or Saint Brelade (also \"Branwallder\", \"Broladre\", \"Brelodre\", \"Brélade\"), who is said to have been the son of the Cornish king, Kenen. He is also said to have been a disciple of Samson of Dol, and worked with this churchman in Cornwall and the Channel Islands. A large section of the Jersey Railway linking La Corbière with Saint Helier ran through the parish between 1870 and 1936.\n\nSt Brelade's Church is situated at the end of St. Brelade's Bay, an unusual situation being comparatively distant from historic centres of population. The small Fisherman's Chapel alongside contains mediaeval frescoes which survived the iconoclasm of the Reformation. According to folklore, the reason for the siting of the parish church is that originally the St. Bréladais intended to build the church inland, much nearer to the homes of the congregation. However \"les p'tits faîtchieaux\" (the little people) who had their temple in a nearby dolmen were disturbed by the construction of the foundations and, every night, would undo the construction work and magically transport all the tools and materials down to the shoreline. Eventually the humans gave up and built the church where the fairies had indicated.\n\nAnother church is located close to the Parish Hall in Saint Aubin. St Aubin on the Hill is an Anglican church in the Parish of Saint Brelade dedicated to Saint Aubin of Angers. The church that stands today was built in the 19th century and is a fine example of Victorian Gothic style, with beautiful stained glass windows. When this was built the appointed minister of the Anglican church also supported the building of a local primary school just a short walk from the church. St Brelade's School served the whole parish until it closed in 1984 and became St Brelade's College, a school that teaches English to foreign pupils.\n\nSt. Brelade has some of the most popular bays in Jersey, with St. Brelade's Bay, Ouaisné, Portelet and parts of both St. Ouen's Bay and St. Aubin's Bay falling within the parish boundaries. The village (or town) of Saint Aubin was originally a fishing port facing St. Helier on the opposite side of St. Aubin's Bay. St Aubin was historically the main centre of population in the parish, but residential development at Les Quennevais has shifted that centre of population.\n\nJersey's prison is situated at La Moye, and the island's desalination plant is also sited in the parish.\n\nThe lighthouse at La Corbière features on the Jersey £5 note (see \"Jersey pound\") and the Jersey 20-pence piece (see \"coins of the Jersey pound\")\n\nThe traditional nickname for St. Bréladais (inhabitants of St. Brelade) is \"carpéleuses\" (caterpillars).\n\nThe parish is divided into vingtaines for administrative purposes as follows:\n\nSt. Brelade is divided into two electoral districts:\n\nSt Brelade is twinned with:\n\n\n\nIn 2009 the parish won a Britain in Bloom award in the small coastal resort category.

Often, a player guards his counterpart (e.g. center guarding center), but a player may be assigned to guard a different position. However, the strategy is not rigid, and a player might switch assignment if needed, or leave his own assignment for a moment to double team an offensive player. The term is commonly used in both men's and women's sports, though the gender-neutral 'player-to-player' also has some usage.\n\nThe alternative to man-to-man defense is zone defense, in which the defender is assigned a specific area of the floor, and then guards whatever offensive player enters his area.\n\nThe advantage of the man-to-man defense is that it is more aggressive than the zone defense. It also allows a team's best defender to stay on a player who has to be guarded at all times. The disadvantage is that it allows the offensive team to run screens more effectively, and it leaves weaker or slower defenders more exposed. In a man-to-man defense, those defenders are generally teammates staying close to their own assigned offensive player, and thus are often not in good position to offer help should a weaker defender be eluded by the offensive player he is trying to guard.\n\nZone defenses were disallowed by the National Basketball Association in 1947. During this period, an illegal defense violation was called when a defender was either guarding an area instead of a specific offensive player, or was double teaming an offensive player away from the ball. A rule change in 2001 eventually permitted zone defense, but also specified that a defender who is standing inside the key is limited to not guarding an offensive player at arm's length for no more than three seconds. If the defender violates this rule, a technical foul is assessed against his team, and the opposing team is granted one free throw and subsequent possession of the basketball. This makes it difficult for NBA teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration.\n\nMan-to-man defense is still the primary defensive scheme in the NBA, and some coaches use it exclusively.\n\nWhen defending the ball (i.e. guarding the man with the basketball) away from the basket in basketball, players typically should use a version of the following technique: the defender stands and faces the opponent. He is positioned between the ball and the basket and may be angled in one direction or another depending on the defensive scheme of that defender's team. He has his feet positioned beyond shoulder width with most of the weight distributed to the balls of his feet. However, the defender's heels should not be off the floor as this will put him off balance. The defender's knees should be bent at roughly a ninety degree angle with the bottom of his thighs parallel to the ground. This will place the defender's buttocks in a seated position. The defender's back should be straight with just a slight tilt forward. This will place the defender's head over the center of his body and maintain proper balance. Depending on the teachings of his coach, the defender should position his hands wide as if he were stretching his wingspan or place one hand high and one hand low.\n\n"}

It was first released for the PC in 1996, and is the second game in the \"Lords of the Realm\" series.\n\nThe game takes place in a medieval setting, with rulers of several counties warring for the right to be king of the land. Players grow crops, accumulate resources, manufacture weapons, manage armies, build and lay siege to castles, capture provinces, and ultimately attempt to conquer their enemies.\n\n\"Lords of the Realm II\" is very different from many medieval strategy games. There is no magic, and unlike many strategy games, it has no technology tree. Players need to carefully manage food (cows, dairy, grain), population, and happiness levels whilst avoiding Malthusian population meltdowns or other players invading their counties. The game is a combination of a turn-based resource management game, in which players grow crops, accumulate resources, manufacture weapons, manage armies, and build and lay siege to castles; and a real-time strategy game with players controlling units individually or in group formations in battles or during sieges.\n\nCompared to the original, \"Lords of the Realm II\" features updated graphics and an improved management system.\n\nImpressions Games general manager David Lester commented during development, \"We wanted the game to be more multiplayer friendly, and one way to do that was by adding realtime combat. Besides, when you can bring a castle down by aiming a battering ram or a catapult at it in realtime, it's a lot more satisfying.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Lords of the Realm II\" debuted in 16th place on PC Data's computer game sales rankings for December 1996. It rose to #9 in January, and it remained in the firm's top 20 for another two months, before dropping out in April. Returning to the top 20 in May and June, \"Lords of the Realm II\" became the 14th-best-selling computer game in the United States during 1997's first half. It exited PC Data's monthly top 20 after a placement of 19th in July. By November, global sales of \"Lords of the Realm II\" had surpassed 350,000 copies.\n\n\"Lords of the Realm II\" went on to be the 19th-biggest computer game seller of 1998, with 245,324 in sales and $2.99 million in revenues. Its total sales ultimately reached 2.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nTim Soete of \"GameSpot\" called \"Lords of the Realm II\" \"a challenging and entertaining experience for strategy enthusiasts.\" However, he opined that the game was overambitious in its real-time combat aspect, with troops that are difficult to maneuver and battlefields that tend to become overcrowded. A \"Next Generation\" critic found it \"simply an outstanding upgrade and improvement over the already excellent original.\" He particularly emphasized the realistic economic model, such as the fact that building an army requires drafting peasants from the population, with a resultant drop in village morale, whereas in most such games armies are built from a separate and unlimited stock of potential soldiers. Like Soete, he saw problems in the combat, such as the enemy AI's ineptitude at siege warfare, but deemed them minor issues.\n\nThe game had an expansion pack released in 1997, \"Lords of the Realm II: Siege Pack\", consisting of new combat scenarios. It was followed by a spin-off \"Lords of Magic\" and a sequel \"Lords of the Realm III\".\n\n"}

This office replaced that of the Civil Commissioner. Upon the end of British rule and the creation of the State of Malta in 1964, this office was replaced by the Governor-General, who represented the British Monarch and not the Government of the United Kingdom as did the Governor. The office of Governor-General was itself abolished in 1974 and replaced by the post of President when Malta became a Republic.\n\nThe Governor, appointed by the British monarch (on the advice of the prime minister), maintained executive power in Malta throughout British rule. He was head of the executive council and the pre-independence government of Malta.\n\nThe Governor was the most powerful official in Malta.\n\nThe Governor was initially supported by a Lieutenant-Governor. For example, from ca.1813 to ca.1820, Major-General Sir William Hutchinson served as Lieutenant Governor. After the death of the Marquess of Hastings in 1826, the British government decided to downgrade the post of Governor to Lieutenant-Governor, with a reduced allowance. Sir Frederick Ponsonby was formally designated Lieutenant-Governor and Commander of the Malta Garrison.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The early stages of development in many economies are characterized by family based production.\n\nIn the early, pre-industrial stage, technology was limited and unchanging. Most economic activity took place within the household, and production and distribution were organized by custom and tradition. High mortality rates and low productivity meant that on the farms and in the towns life was short and living conditions were harsh – an existence which was accepted fatalistically. In this society the family played a central role, since economic and social status was defined by birth, family ties, and local custom. Most importantly, the family was a productive unit, and physical strength – typically a male attribute – was an essential element in survival.\n\nThe family economic unit has always been dependent on specialized labor done by family members. The family was a multi-generational producer with capital and land provided by older generations and labor provided by younger generations. Goods were produced not only for home consumption but to sell and trade in the market as well. Family production was not only limited to agricultural products but they also produced manufacturing goods and provided services.\n\nIn order to sustain a viable family economy during the pre-industrial era labor was needed. The labor needed to operate the farm and provide old-age support came from family members, fertility was high. High fertility and guaranteed employment on the family farm made education, beyond the basic literacy needed to read the Bible, expensive and unnecessary.\n\nAround the time of the post industrial stage, the European family changed from a unit of production to a unit of consumption. The new era of industrialization that Europe now found itself in brought numerous change to Europe. Now farming could be done with less individuals, removing the need for children as economic assets and instead created a view in which they were seen as liabilities. In addition to this, new ideas and inventions that allowed for the Industrialization to take place further contributed to the demise of the family economy. The new social norms saw a capitalist market that encouraged production in large scale factories, farms and mines. Wage labor would become a staple of European society and saw family members no longer working together but instead using their wages they had earned to buy goods which they consumed as a family unit. The industrial revolution, starting in the nineteenth and going into the twentieth century, is seen as the force that changed the economic family and is basically responsible for the \"modern family.\"\n\nNussbaum, M.

It was first released on June 15, 1994, and is the first game in the \"Lords of the Realm\" series.\n\nThe game takes place in a medieval setting, with several characters warring for the right to be either King of England or King of Germany. Players manage their armies as well as their land and population, build and lay siege to castles, and generally attempt to crush their enemies.\n\nBattles between armies take place in a real-time environment, similar to real-time strategy games, with players able to control individual units as well as control them as a group, during which units group into formations. Players may also choose to allow the computer to determine the outcome of the battle. The game also features a small castle-building portion.\n\nThe game was published by Impression Games in the UK (Amiga) and US (DOS) both in 1994. It was distributed by Sierra On-Line Ltd. in the UK (Windows) in 1997, DMV Daten- und Medienverlag GmbH & Co.

This work described English history ranging from the Norman Conquest through to the reign of King Edward I.\n\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\" deemed \"Lords of the Realm\" a must-have title for strategy fans, citing the randomized events, genuine challenge, impressive rendered cut scenes, player-controlled battles, and overall diverse gameplay.\n\nIn a retrospective review, Michael House of \"Allgame\" wrote, \"Whatever faults can be attributed to the game's mechanics or contents are almost uniformly minor and in most instances an error of omission. From structure to game play, \"Lords of the Realm\" has notched its own place in wargaming history.\" \"The Escapist's\" Stew Shearer summed up his review with \"\"Lords of the Realm\" is a stellar strategy game that's more than worth the $5.99 that GOG is asking for it (and \"Lords of the Realm 2\") [\"sic\"].

Opening in 1980, it is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government. The building is notable for its hemispherical shape, which contains a planetarium, the only one in Hong Kong. The main facilities of the museum are located in a building next to the planetarium, showcasing information about the Solar System, cosmology, and spaceflight.\n\nAccessible from Salisbury Road, it is adjacent to the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, the Hong Kong Museum of Art, and the Tsim Sha Tsui Clock Tower. The Hong Kong Science Museum and the Hong Kong Museum of History are also located in Tsim Sha Tsui.\n\nThe Space Museum regularly holds various types of astronomical exhibitions and lectures. It is also open to schools, groups and the public. It has been nicknamed the \"pineapple bun\" (菠蘿包) due to its shape.\n\nThe idea of a planetarium was originally proposed in 1961 by the Urban Council. Ten years later, the Urban Services Department (USD) set up a working group to study overseas experience in establishing planetariums. The study was aimed at laying the groundwork for setting up the future Hong Kong Space Museum. The Hong Kong Government decided to build the museum at Tsim Sha Tsui and invited Mr. Joseph Liu to serve as Planetarium Advisor.\n\nIn 1974, The USD signed a contract with the Carl Zeiss Company to purchase a planetarium and other equipment with a price of HK$3,050,000.\n\nConstruction commenced in 1977 and the museum opened on 8 October 1980. The museum contained the world's first computerized planetarium. In the 2008-2009 financial year, there were about 590,000 visits to the museum.\n\nIn 2015, in order to carry out renovation work, the exhibition hall in the Sky Hall was closed on October 5 and reopened on April 25, 2018.\n\nThe museum has two wings: east wing and west wing. The former consists of the nucleus of the museum's planetarium, which has an egg-shaped dome structure. Beneath it are the Stanley Ho Space Theatre, the Hall of Space Science, workshops and offices. The west wing houses the Hall of Astronomy, the Lecture Hall, a gift shop and offices.\n\nThe planetarium's egg-shaped dome covers more than 8,000 square metres, making it a famous landmark in Hong Kong. It was the first local planetarium for the popularisation of astronomy and space science. The computerized star imager in the Sky Gallery of the Space Museum is capable of simulating the sky through optical principles, projecting 8,000 stars onto the hemisphere screen of the Planetarium.\n\nThere is also a mockup of the nose and cockpit section of the Space Shuttle orbiter.\n\nHong Kong Space Museum has two thematic exhibition halls: the Hall of Space Science and the Hall of Astronomy on the ground and first floors respectively. The exhibits, predominantly interactive, enable visitors to learn through a series of entertaining and educational experiences.\n\nThe museum sits within walking distance of both Tsim Sha Tsui Station and East Tsim Sha Tsui Station of the MTR.

The fund provides scholarships enabling low-income children to attend private schools. More than 25,700 students in Kindergarten to 8th Grade receive the fund's scholarships. It was founded in 1998 by Theodore J. Forstmann and John T. Walton.\n\nForstmann and the late John Walton met as donors to the Washington Scholarship Fund (WSF), founded in 1993 to provide scholarships for low-income families in Washington D.C. When more than 8,000 applications applied to WSF for the 1998-99 school year the two men realized there was substantial demand among poorer families for alternatives to the public school system.\n\nThis need in Washington convinced Ted and John that low-income parents everywhere would welcome the opportunity to choose a private or parochial school over their assigned public school, even if it meant they had to pay a portion of the tuition themselves. After the DC scholarships were awarded, they began thinking of a way to take the program nationwide and truly open the doors of educational opportunity. John and Ted first announced the formation of the Children's Scholarship Fund at the New York Public Library on June 9, 1998. Then Ted, John and CSF's new staff traveled across the country to secure partnerships in major cities and states. Once the partner programs were in place, CSF began to get the word out to parents through local community organizations, churches, and the private schools themselves, and scholarship applications began to roll in. The demand for scholarships was much higher than anticipated. By the March 31 deadline, the parents of more than 1.25 million children had applied.\n\nAn astonishing 43% of the eligible population in Newark, NJ, applied for scholarships. In New York, 168,000 applications came in – representing 32% of those eligible to apply. Other cities with especially notable numbers of applications included Los Angeles (26% of those eligible), Baltimore (38%), St. Louis (32%), and Philadelphia (35%). Parents all over the country were sending the same message: they wanted alternatives for their children's education, and they were willing to pay something out of their own pockets to get it.\n\nOn April 21, 1999, the first Children's Scholarship Fund scholarships were awarded to 40,000 children all across America. Ceremonies were held in New York, Los Angeles, and many other CSF cities. In New York, Ted Forstmann explained his goal for the scholarships, saying, \"Every child, regardless of their parents' income, should have access to a quality education – an education that will not only prepare them for successful private lives, but help them to build cohesive communities and a strong democracy.\"\n\nPresent\n\nOriginally, CSF was planned as a four-year program, and families were not promised anything beyond that. But it quickly became obvious that to truly ensure the children would gain a solid foundation, funding would have to continue through the 8th grade. So, after the first four years, CSF went back to the partner programs and donors in an attempt to extend the original awards through 8th grade and allow younger siblings to get scholarships, too. Most of the partner programs not only agreed to extend the original scholarships through 8th grade and add siblings – they also awarded brand new scholarships.\n\nToday, many of the CSF partner programs continue to offer new scholarships annually. The CSF national headquarters in New York administers more than 8,000 scholarships in New York City, as well as providing matching funds and program support for the partner programs nationwide.\n\nSince inception, CSF has awarded $654 million in scholarships to 152,000 needy children. In the 2012-13 school year, more than 25,700 children in 30 partner programs across the country are using CSF scholarships to attend private school. Of the students who receive CSF scholarships, 92 percent graduate high school on time, and 90 percent enroll in college.\n\n"}

After forming in mid-1968, the band toured extensively across the United Kingdom with sets formed of original material and rearranged cover versions. They signed with Atlantic in early 1969, and entered Advision and Trident Studios in London to record their first album. \"Yes\" includes covers of \"Every Little Thing\" by the Beatles and \"I See You\" by the Byrds.\n\n\"Yes\" received some positive reviews from critics in the United Kingdom and United States, but was not a commercial success and failed to enter the charts. Two singles from the album were released: \"Sweetness\" and \"Looking Around\". The album was remastered in 1994 and 2003, the latter containing several previously unreleased tracks including a rendition of \"Something's Coming\" from \"West Side Story\".\n\nIn August 1968, Yes formed with a line-up of singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, drummer Bill Bruford, and keyboardist Tony Kaye and the band played their first gig under the name on 4 August. They toured the United Kingdom extensively, playing sets formed of original material and rearranged cover songs from rock, pop, funk, and jazz artists. After Bruford left the band temporarily with the aim of pursuing education at university, the line-up returned to its original formation in November 1968. In the search for finding a record label, manager Roy Flynn and Atlantic managing director Frank Fenter secured a deal to have Yes audition for Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records at the Speakeasy Club in London. The gig was a success, and news of the band's signing to the label were reported by the press in March 1969.\n\nWith their contract secured, Yes recorded their debut album in the spring of 1969, mostly at Advision with additional sessions at Trident Studios in London. Anderson and Banks recalled the band were in the studio between one and four weeks. They were joined by producer Paul Clay and engineer Gerald Chevin (and John Anthony at Trident). Banks was unsure as to how Clay became involved in the album, and deemed Clay unfit for the job as he had worked on film soundtracks and knew little about working with rock bands, which caused the album to lack in quality as a result, with Bruford's drums sounding \"like biscuit tins\" and his guitar sounding \"clangy\". Banks gave engineer Gerald Chevin the nickname \"The Weasel\" or \"The Ferret\" as his small stature and glasses made him resemble \"a rocket scientist from the 1950s\" and his general distaste for rock music. He also consistently asked the band to turn their levels down to the dislike of Banks, who would put his guitar levels up when no one was looking.\n\nRecording was also met with technical difficulties, with the group spending two days trying to get a Hammond organ for Kaye to play on to function correctly. They hired one to use as Kaye owned a Vox Continental disguised as a Hammond. This was Bruford's first time in a professional recording studio, and it was only when the album was nearly complete that he realized he could alter the volume levels of the other band members' instruments in his headphones. Instead, he recorded his parts with the guitar loud in one ear \"and nothing else in the other\". Bruford described his playing on the album as \"a mishmash of everything I'd heard\" and later recognized his naive playing, specifically to \"swing on the cymbals\". Around the third day of recording, Ertegun visited the studio to hear what had been put down, but the band had nothing to play for him.\n\n\"Beyond & Before\" was written by Squire and Clive Bailey, former singer and guitarist in Mabel Greer's Toyshop, the rock band that was a precursor to Yes. The band would open their live shows with this tune, which features three-part harmonies. Years later, Banks was still unsure as to what the lyrics meant yet suggested they were \"drug induced\". Squire described it as \"one of those acid rock kind of songs\" with its psychedelic lyrics. \"I See You\" is a cover version of the original performed by American rock band the Byrds. Banks was disappointed with the version recorded for the album as he later recognized the mistakes on it. The instrumental section with the guitar solo was often stretched for several minutes when performed live, sometimes ending in Banks throwing his guitar in the air and banging it on stage. \"Yesterday and Today\" was one of the tracks recorded at Trident Studios and features Bruford playing the vibraphone, despite telling the band he can play the instrument and Banks remembering the drummer getting nervous when it came to recording. \"Looking Around\" remained one of Squire's favourite tracks on the album. When it came to recording it, the band had some difficulties with its pitching as they were unsure on what key the song was in.\n\n\"Harold Land\" got its title from Bruford, who recalled someone asking out loud what the track should be called. \"I remember somebody saying ... 'I want to write a song about a man called...' and I said, 'Harold Land' as I walked through the room\". The song is named after Harold Land, an American tenor saxophonist, yet the song's lyrics deal with the effects of war on the named character. The album's second cover version is \"Every Little Thing\" by the Beatles. Squire did not realise how much he liked the band's version until he turned on the radio after performing at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1984 and liked the instrumentation, failing to recognise it was the band's version being played until Anderson's voice was heard. \"Sweetness\" was the first song that Anderson and Squire collaborated on following their initial meeting. It is featured in the comedy drama film \"Buffalo '66\" (1998), the first film with Vincent Gallo as director. \"Survival\" was a song that had contributions from the whole band, but it was not worked on fully due to the limited time they had to finish the album. It later became bothersome for Bruford due to its ecology-inspired lyrics and \"drippy\" melody.\n\nThe album was packaged in a gatefold sleeve, with the UK pressing featuring a front cover of the word \"YES\" in blue and red inside a speech bubble against a plain black background. The sleeve was designed by Cosby/Fletcher/Forbes, a design collaboration formed of graphic designers Theo Crosby, Alan Fletcher, and Colin Forbes, with additional design work from Haig Adishian. Music journalist and band biographer Chris Welch wrote: \"Although the sleeve wasn't graced with the kind of elaborate cover art that Roger Dean would introduce on the 1971 \"Fragile\" album, the ... cover was most effective\". The front cover of the United States and Canada pressings feature a photograph of the band at an architectural centre in Fulham taken by American photographer David Gahr. It was also included in the album's 2003 remastered release. The gatefold includes a group and mid-gig photographs taken by Nicky Wright at Parliament Hill Fields in north London. When it came to producing the liner notes, Flynn requested that his name was omitted from the list of credits. Anderson is credited on the original release as \"John\"; he removed the \"h\" from his name in 1970.\n\n\"Yes\" was released on 25 July 1969 in the UK. Its release in the US followed on 15 October 1969. \"Sweetness\" was put out as the album's lead single and the band's first overall, which Banks disagreed with as he thought it was the song that represented the band's style the least.\n\nThe album received a positive reception from two American newspapers. Scott Campbell of the \"Arizona Republic\" wrote that Yes are \"a promising set\" that deliver on being \"solid and together at nearly all times\", with \"strong and competent\" vocals from Anderson. David Wagner, in the \"Post-Crescent\", agreed with Campbell in Yes being a \"very promising\" group. He recognised \"a lot of jazz swinginess\" on the album, particularly on the two cover songs, and compared Banks's guitar style to that of Wes Montgomery which comes across strong on the guitar and drum section on \"I See You\". Wagner rated the band's original material as \"generally good\" and \"fully arranged\" despite the over-sentimental quality of \"Sweetness\", \"but there are so many delights on so many levels here that it's hard to complain\". Lester Bangs favourably reviewed the album in \"Rolling Stone\", writing that it was \"the kind of album that sometimes insinuates itself into your routine with a totally unexpected thrust of musical power.\"\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's 1969 and 2003 sleeve notes.\n\nYes\n\nProduction\n\n\nBooks\n"}

The call letters were changed to WGLD in 1997 when the station adopted an oldies format as \"Gold 104.5.\" In 2005, WGLD became WJJK, dropping oldies and subscribing to the Jack FM adult hits format. The station became known as \"104.5 Jack FM.\" In September 2006, WJJK became a \"classic hits\" station, while keeping the same call letters. The name \"Jack\" was dropped in December 2007 and it is now known as \"Classic Hits 104.5 WJJK.\"\n\n"}

She has released five albums: three for RCA Nashville, one for Rising Tide Records and one for Dualtone Records, and has charted in the top 40 of the U.S. \"Billboard\" country charts with \"Baby, Walk On\" and \"The Things You Left Undone,\" both at No. 36. Besides most of her own material, Berg has written hits for T.G. Sheppard, Karen Brooks, Trisha Yearwood, Deana Carter, Patty Loveless, Kenny Chesney and others. In 2008 she was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and in 2018 she received the Poet's Award from the Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\nMatraca Berg's mother, Icie Calloway, moved from Harlan County, Kentucky, to Nashville in the 1960s to seek her fortune as a singer and songwriter shortly before Matraca was born. Matraca's Aunt Sudie Calloway was a successful Music Row backup singer. Aunts Coleida Calloway and Clara Howard were backup vocalists on Kentucky’s Renfro Valley Barn Dance. Uncle Jim Baker was a steel guitar player who also spent some time running Mel Tillis's song publishing companies. When Matraca was 2 years old, her mother married nuclear physicist Ron Berg, who legally adopted Matraca.\n\nBerg's mother found only limited success in the music industry and eventually became a nurse. Berg herself then took up songwriting with her mother's encouragement. When Berg played her songs for songwriter Bobby Braddock, he volunteered to co-write with her. She found her earliest success in their collaboration, \"Faking Love\", which was sung by Karen Brooks and T. G. Sheppard, topping the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles (now Hot Country Songs) charts on February 19, 1983.\n\nAfter her mother's death in 1985, Berg continued to have great success writing songs for other performers. Reba McEntire had a No. 1 song with her \"The Last One to Know\", and Randy Travis, Tanya Tucker, Ray Price, Marie Osmond, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, Michelle Wright and others recorded her songs.\n\nBerg signed to a recording contract with RCA Records Nashville in 1990, releasing her debut album \"Lying to the Moon\" that year. Its first two singles, \"Baby, Walk On\" and \"The Things You Left Undone,\" both charted in the country top 40 at No. 36, followed by the No. 43 \"I Got It Bad\" and No. 55 \"I Must Have Been Crazy.\"\n\nWhat was to be her follow-up album, \"Bittersweet Surrender\", was recorded in 1991. It featured the single \"It's Easy to Tell,\" which charted in November 1991. The album was rejected by the label, which wanted a more mainstream-sounding recording instead. One of the songs from this canceled album, \"Wrong Side of Memphis,\" later became a Top Ten hit for Trisha Yearwood. She continued to write for others, and in 1994, released a pop album \"The Speed of Grace\".\n\nBerg's 1995 song, \"You Can Feel Bad\", co-written with Tim Krekel and recorded by Patty Loveless, was a Number 1 country single, spending twenty weeks on the charts.\n\nBerg co-wrote \"Strawberry Wine\" along with Gary Harrison, which Deana Carter released as a single. Berg won the \"Song of the Year\" at the 1997 CMA (Country Music Association) Awards. The same year, she released the album \"Sunday Morning to Saturday Night\" via Rising Tide Records; it produced the singles \"That Train Don't Run\" and \"Back in the Saddle,\" the former of which was released by Pinmonkey in 2006. In 1999, RCA released a compilation album entitled \"Lying to the Moon & Other Stories\" which also included tracks from her 1997 Rising Tide release.\n\nIn 2004 and 2005, Berg was nominated for induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, making her one of the youngest nominees in history. She continues to be a prolific and respected country songwriter. She currently lives in Nashville with her husband, Jeff Hanna, a member of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. She was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\n"}

His early academic education was limited, due to the difficulty in attracting good teachers to the remote valley in eastern Oregon. After graduating from the University of Oregon, he became a Fulbright Scholar. He went on to receive a law degree from Harvard University.\n\nSummers taught for 50 years, 42 of them at Cornell Law School. He has won international acclaim for his work in contracts, commercial law, jurisprudence, and legal theory. During his time at Cornell Law School, Summers authored and co-authored multiple works on various legal topics with a focus on contracts and commercial law. His treatise on the Uniform Commercial Code, co-authored with Professor James J. White, is the most widely cited on the subject. His other influential works include texts on legal realism, form and substance in the law, and on statutory interpretation. Summers has served as official advisor both to the Drafting Commission for the Russian Civil Code and to the Drafting Commission for the Egyptian Civil Code.

{"id": "2046950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046950", "title": "Race (biology)", "text": "Race (biology)\n\nIn biological taxonomy, race is an informal rank in the taxonomic hierarchy, below the level of subspecies. It has been used as a higher rank than strain, with several strains making up one race. Various definitions exist. Races may be genetically distinct populations of individuals within the same species, or they may be defined in other ways, e.g. geographically, or physiologically. Genetic isolation between races is not complete, but genetic differences may have accumulated that are not (yet) sufficient to separate species. The term is recognized by some, but not governed by any of the formal codes of biological nomenclature.\n\nIn botany, the Latin words stirps and proles were traditionally used, and \"proles\" was recommended in the first botanical Code of Nomenclature, published in 1868.\n\nRaces are defined according to any identifiable characteristic, including gene frequencies. \"Race differences are relative, not absolute\". Adaptive differences that distinguish races can accumulate even with substantial gene flow and clinal (rather than discrete) habitat variation. Hybrid zones between races are semi-permeable barriers to gene flow, see for example the chromosome races of the Auckland tree wētā.\n\nThe term \"race\" has also historically been used in relation to domesticated animals, as another term for \"breed\"; this usage survives in combining form, in the term landrace, also applied to domesticated plants. The cognate words for \"race\" in many languages (; ; ) may convey meanings the English word does not, and are frequently used in the sense of 'domestic breed'.\n\nIf the races are sufficiently different or if they have been tested to show little genetic connection regardless of phenotype, two or more groups/races can be identified as subspecies or (in botany, mycology, and phycology) another infraspecific rank), and given a name. Ernst Mayr wrote that a subspecies can be \"a that is sufficiently different taxonomically to be worthy of a separate name.\"\n\nStudy of populations preliminarily labelled races may sometimes lead to classification of a new species. For example, in 2008, two populations of the brown planthopper (\"Nilaparvata lugens\") in the Philippines, one adapted to feeding on rice, and another on \"Leersia hexandra\" grass, were reclassified from races into \"two distinct, but very closely allied, sympatric species\", based on poor survival rate when given the opposite food source, barriers to hybridization between the populations, uniform preference for mating between members of the same population, differences in mating sounds, oviposition variances, and other distinguishable characteristics.\n\nFor pathogenic bacteria adapted to particular hosts, races can be formally named as pathovars. For parasitic organisms governed by the \"International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants\", the term \"forma specialis\" (plural \"formae speciales\") is used.\n\nClassification of fungal microbes into races is done frequently in mycology, the study of fungi, and especially in phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, which are often fungal. The term \"physiologic race\" was recommended for use over \"biologic form\" at the International Botanical Congress of 1935. Although historically the term has been used inconsistently by plant pathologists, the modern trend is to use race to refer to \"groups of host genotypes permitting characterization of virulence\" (in simpler terms: grouping the parasitic fungi into races based on how strongly they affect particular host plants).\n\nCommercial \"Cucumis melo\" (cantaloupe and muskmelon) production, for example, has been engaged in a biological \"arms race\", since 1925, against cucurbit powdery mildew, caused by successively arising races of \"Podosphaera xanthii\" fungus, with new cultivars of melons being developed for resistance to these pathogens.\n\nA 2004 literature review of this issue concluded that \"race identification is important for basic research and is especially important for the commercial seed industry\", but was seen as having little utility in horticulture for choosing specific cultivars, because of the rapidity with which the local pathogen population can change geographically, seasonally, and by host plant.\n\nClassification of fungal races can be difficult because host plants' responses to particular populations of fungi can be affected by humidity, light, temperature, and other environmental factors; different host plants may not all respond to particular fungal populations or vice versa; and identification of genetic differences between populations thought to form distinct fungal races can be elusive.\n\n"}
{"id": "2046953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046953", "title": "Mérode Altarpiece", "text": "Mérode Altarpiece\n\nThe Mérode Altarpiece (or Annunciation Triptych) is an oil on oak panel triptych, now in The Cloisters, in New York City. It is unsigned and undated, but attributed to Early Netherlandish painter Robert Campin and an assistant. The three panels represent, from left to right, the donors kneeling in prayer in a garden, the moment of the Annunciation to Mary, which is set in a contemporary, domestic setting, and Saint Joseph, a carpenter with the tools of his trade. The many elements of religious symbolism include the lily and fountain (symbolising the purity of Mary), and the Holy Spirit represented by the rays of light coming through from the left hand window.\n\nThe central panel was completed after 1422, likely between 1425 and 1428, it is thought by a member of Campin's workshop. An earlier version, now in Brussels, may be Campin's original panel. The outer wing panels are later additions by a workshop member, probably on request by the donor who sought to elevate the central panel to a triptych and place himself in the pictorial space. They contain views of the city of Liège, in today's Belgium. \n\nThe triptych is a founding and important work in the then emerging late Gothic, Early Netherlandish style, and has been described as a \"milestone between two periods; it at once summarizes the medieval tradition and lays the foundation for the development of modern painting\".\n\nThe attribution of the New York triptych has been the subject of wide scholarly debate. It seems to have been completed the same year as the Ghent Altarpiece, in 1432, making the painter a contemporary of Jan van Eyck. It is usually accepted as belonging to a group of paintings associated with the Master of Flémalle, assumed to be Robert Campin. For a time it was attributed to Campin's apprentice Rogier van der Weyden based on the realistic style that would become van der Weyden's hallmark. There is another version of the Annunciation panel in Brussels, slightly earlier but damaged, which may represent the original version by Campin.\n\nTechnical examination of the wood panels suggest that the triptych was completed by a number of hands. The wood of the central panel is different and earlier to that of the wings, while the hinging further suggest that the central panel was not intended as part of a triptych. The central panel is likely a copy of an earlier composition by Campin, while the wings were probably a later commission from the donor to attach to the main panel to form a small private devotional altarpiece. Areas of the panels have been reworked; both the female doner and bearded man on the left wing were painted over landscape, while the window behind the Virgin was originally painted in gold.\n\nCampbell is not convinced by the association with Flemalle group, and thus Robert Campin. He describes the Mérode as \"incoherent in design\", lacking Campin's usual trait of spatial continuity, as found in the \"Seilern Triptych\". The open sky as seen through the central panel windows is incongruous in point of view with the street scene in the donor panel. Campbell highlights poor command of perspective in the donor panel, and observes that it is \"unfortunate that a line of one of the mortar courses in the garden wall disappear into the donor's mouth\". Campbell describes the wing panels as pedestrian, and the product of lesser hands. He gives prominence to the Brussels panel, which he cautiously attributes to the Master of Flémalle.\n\nThe triptych is relatively small, indicating that it was commissioned for private, domestic use; the central panel measures 64 × 63 cm and each wing is 65 × 27 cm. The panels share a very steep perspective, in which the viewer seems to be looking down on the figures from an elevated point of view. In other respects the perspective is underdeveloped; neither the Virgin nor Gabriel seem to rest on solid ground, while the female donor appears to hover and appears to be barely able to fit within the space she is positioned in.\n\nThe panels are in good condition, with little over-paint, glossing, dirt layers, or paint losses. They are almost entirely in oil, and establish many of the inventions that were to make the technique so successful and adaptable over the following centuries. The serenity of the works is achieved, in part, through the dominance of pale, opaque white, red, and blue hues. The size of the panels and the at times minute attention to detail are similar to the focus of contemporary miniatures, of the kind seem in the two illuminated manuscripts in the central panel.\n\nThe panel is one of the earliest representations of the Annunciation to Mary in a contemporary Northern European interior, which appears to be a dining room. This is Campin's main innovation, showing a reading Madonna, with unbound hair in a familiar setting, an image that lead to many adoptions, most famously Rogier van der Weyden's \"Reading Magdalen\". The colors in the upper part of the central panel are dominated by the cool grays of the plaster and the brown of the timber wall, while the lower half is mostly of warmer and deeper brownish greens and reds. Art historians suggest that the success of the panel is due to the contrast between the warm reds of the Virgin's robe and the pale blue hues of the archangel Gabriel's vestment.\nThe panels' perspective is unusually steep and unevenly distributed. The angle of the table in particular is illogical. Art historian Lorne Campbell describes these distortions as \"disturbing\". \n\nIt shows the moment before the traditional Annunciation scene, when Mary is still unaware of the presence of Gabriel. She is in a red gown rather than the more usual blue, and in a relaxed pose, reading from a book of hours, with her hair unbound. Unusually for a medieval depiction of the Annunciation, the dove of the Holy Spirit is not visible. Instead he is represented by the extinguished light of the candle, and the beam of light falling from the window to the left, which carries the Christ Child holding a cross. \nThe Christ Child flies down towards Mary from the left oculus, signifying her impregnation by God the Father. He gazes directly at her and holds a cross. The folding-table contains a recently extinguished candle, and shows coiling smoke and a still glowing wick. This maybe a reference to the Holy Spirit, who, according to some late medieval writers, descended to the apostles \"like a puff of wind\".\n\nThe white lily in a Tuscan earthenware jug on the table represents Mary's virginity and purity, as does the white, ocher towel. The jug contains a series of enigmatic letters in Latin and Hebraic, deciphered by some art historians as \"De Campyn\", which they presume as the artist's signature. An open manuscript is placed on the green velvet book pouch. Unusually, the book is positioned next to the Virgin rather than the shelf. The pages seem worn and handled, indicating that it has been well read. It has been suggested that the book reflects the Carthusian Ludolf of Saxony's idea of the secluded life of the Virgin - that she earlier lived with \"the Holy Scriptures as her sole companion\".\n\nThe right hand half of the back wall holds three windows, one of which contains a lattice screen. The beams of the ceiling are supported by a series of corbels. The sky visible through the windows is a later addition, which was painted over an earlier gold ground. The armorial shields are also later additions.\n\nThe donor and his wife are shown kneeling in prayer are in the left panel, looking through a half-open door into the Virgin's Hortus conclusus. The door presents a continuity oddity; although it can be seen opening into the Virgins room from the left panel, no such door entrance is visible in the center panel. Addressing this, the art historians Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen suppose that the donor is \"imagining that she has entered into his house. From without, he has opened the door; with his own eyes he beholds the Mother of God and petitions her for a family\".\n\nThe attendant dressed in a festive outfit is by a later artist, perhaps it was added after the donor's marriage. The left hand space contains an unlocked entrance leading to a minutely detailed street scene. The panel is the more striking as the door leading into the Virgin's chamber is wide open, hugely presumptuous for even a mid-fifteenth century commission, and suggesting access to the gates of heaven.\n\nThe donors are identifiable as bourgeoisie from nearby Mechelen, and are documented in Tournai in 1427, identifiable from the coat of arms in the stained glass window of the central panel.\n\nIt is assumed that this panel was a later commission to Campin's workshop, not part of the original single panel design. There has been speculation that it was completed by the young Rogier van der Weyden.\n\nThe altarpiece was commissioned either by the businessman Jan Engelbrecht, or the Cologne-born merchant Peter Engelbrecht and his wife Margarete Scrynmaker. Engelbrecht translates from German as \"angel brings\", while Scrynmaker means \"cabinet maker\", the latter perhaps influencing the choice of Joseph in the right hand panel.\n\nSaint Joseph, a carpenter by trade, occupies the right-hand panel. He is shown at work, boring spike holes into one of the instruments of the Passion. An unusual feature is that, although Mary and Joseph did not marry until after the Annunciation, they are apparently living together and sharing the same space. Joseph is shown with the tools of his craft, visible implements include an ax, saw, rod, and a small footstool sitting before a fire of burning logs. Joseph's presence is may be intended to invoke 10 :15 from the Book of Isaiah: \"Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth there-\nwith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?\nas if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if\nthe staff should lift up itself as if was it were no wood.\" Isaiah's words were intended as incentatory and revolutionary, were followed by a treatise for the salvation of Israel, and protested against an Assyrian king he considered boorish and vainglorious. Given this, Joseph is seen by art historians as a reassuring presence, warding the devil from the center panel.\n\nJoseph is presented as a relatively old man wearing an eggplant coloured coat and blue turban, in a panel dressed by dark and warm colours, framed by shadows thrown from the window shutters. He works on a mouse trap, probably a symbol of the cross at the Crucifixion, in that it represents an imagined but literal capture of the Devil, said to have held a man in ransom because of the sin of Adam. In some scripts, Christ's naked flesh was served as bait for the devil; \"He rejoiced in Christ's death, like a bailiff of death. What he rejoiced in was then his own undoing. The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death.\"\n\nThe background contains a cityscape, probably fictitious, showing the spires of two churches, one of which is now lost, the churches of St. Pierre (left) and Sainte Croix (right) in Liege.\n\nThe iconography contains complex religious symbolism, although their extent and exact nature is debated – Meyer Schapiro pioneered the study of the symbolism of the mousetrap, and Erwin Panofsky later extended, or perhaps over-extended, the analysis of symbols to cover many more details of the furniture and fittings. Similar debates exist for many Early Netherlandish paintings, and a number of the details seen for the first time here reappear in later Annunciations by other artists. \n\nThe symbolic elements in the central panel mostly relate to the Annunciation, the Mass and the sacrament of the Eucharist. Mary sits on the floor to show her humility. The scroll and book in front of Mary symbolize the Old and the New Testaments, and the roles Mary and the Christ child played in the fulfillment of prophecy. The lilies in the earthenware vase on the table represent Mary's virginity. Other symbols of her purity include the enclosed garden (\"Hortus conclusus\"), and the white towel, while the small windows to the right, and the half-closed windows at the rear, serve to emphasise the quiet, virginal life she has lived.\nThe lion finials on the bench may have a symbolic role (referring to the Seat of Wisdom, or throne of Solomon) – this feature is often seen in other paintings, religious or secular (like Jan van Eyck's \"Arnolfini Portrait\"). The arrangements for washing at the back of the room, which are considered unusual for a domestic interior, may relate to the similar arrangements of a piscina for the officiating priest to wash his hands during Mass. The sixteen sides of the table may allude to the sixteen main Hebrew prophets; the table is usually seen as an altar, and the archangel Gabriel wears the vestments of a deacon. The basin may represent both the purity of Virgin, and the cleansing of the Christian act of baptism.\n\nIn the right-hand panel, Saint Joseph, a carpenter, has constructed a mouse trap symbolizing Christ's trapping and defeat of the devil, a metaphor used three times by Saint Augustine: \"The cross of the Lord was the devil's mousetrap; the bait by which he was caught was the Lord's death.\" The iconography of the right-hand panel has been studied in detail by Russell. He shows that the object that Joseph is working on is a scandalum or stumbling block, a spiked block that gashes the legs of a punishment victim who walks with it hanging from a cord around his waist. Joseph's joinery instruments are displayed in a consistently unnatural manner, suggesting that they have been planned to fit a specific agenda; for example the joinery instruments on the table are so placed as to represent the three crosses of Christ and the two thieves.\n\nIts early history is obscure. The triptych was owned by the aristocratic Belgian Arenberg and Mérode families from 1820 to 1849 before reaching the art market, and has been in the collection of the Cloisters, New York since 1956. Until its acquisition it had been in private collection for many years and thus inaccessible to both scholars and the public. Its purchase was funded by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and was described at the time as a \"major event for the history of collecting in the United States\".\n\n"}

Today, plastic pants are usually made out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU), though, in some instances, latex rubber is still used. Latex rubber has significant drawbacks in these applications: it is easily damaged by rough handling and by oils, creams, and ointments; it does not allow air to ventilate; it also makes a characteristic rustling noise when moved, which limits its use in situations where discretion is necessary.\n\nThe availability of inexpensive, and easily worked, man-made waterproof materials since the 1950s has significantly improved the quality of life of those with continence problems, and has contributed to changes in clothing style and freedom, especially for infants and menstruating women.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, oiled silk was used as a waterproofing medium in adult clothing, but not until latex rubber was commercially available from the 1920s did the idea of wearing a protective garment became commonplace. Ladies panties were worn with a waterproof latex crotch insert or a waterproof panel in the back of an underskirt, to make coping with heavy periods easier and socially safer. The original diaper covers were made from oiled wool, which was naturally waterproof. Newly available latex pants for covering diapers reduced the difficulties in caring for young children on long journeys, on special social occasions, and overnight.\n\nDuring the 1950s, plastics, mainly PVC, replaced latex on account of their lower cost, ease of maintenance, and lack of noise when handled. However, the history of these garments has influenced their modern names: “Rubber pants” and “Rubbers” are used commonly to mean waterproof pants of all kinds, even though they are typically now made of plastic rather than latex.\n\nThe invention of superabsorbent polymers (for diapers and incontinence pads), and of blood-gelling polymers (for sanitary pads) largely displaced traditional cloth diapers and pads. Not only were these modern absorbent materials lighter and less bulky, but they became available as an “all-in-one” solution with its own integral waterproof plastic backing. This eliminated the need for separate waterproof underwear in many situations. Nevertheless, waterproof pants are still used as a second line of defense where absolute protection from leakage is crucial.\n\nThe development of plastic pants contributed significantly to juvenile fashion. Until the late 1950s, infants of both sexes usually wore short dresses until they were ready for toilet training – thus avoiding the risks to clothing and hygiene of having top clothes in prolonged close contact with a damp or soiled diaper. Effective and easily obtainable waterproofing – whether integral with the pad or as separate pants – safely allowed a child to be dressed in trousers. The development of disposable diapers made the fit of clothing even neater as much of the bulk of cloth diapers was gone.\n\n"}

T-antennas are typically used in the VLF, LF, MF, and shortwave bands, and are widely used as transmitting antennas for amateur radio stations, and long wave and medium wave AM broadcasting stations. They can also be used as receiving antennas for shortwave listening.\n\nThe antenna consists of one or more horizontal wires suspended between two supporting radio masts or buildings and insulated from them at the ends. A vertical wire is connected to the center of the horizontal wires and hangs down close to the ground, connected to the transmitter or receiver. Combined, the two sections form a ‘T’ shape, hence the name. The transmitter power is applied, or the receiver is connected, between the bottom of the vertical wire and a ground connection.\n\nThe T-antenna functions as a monopole antenna with capacitive top-loading; other antennas in this category include the inverted-L, umbrella, and triatic antennas. It was invented during the first decades of radio, in the wireless telegraphy era, before 1920.\n\nAt frequencies below 1 MHz, the feasible length of an antenna’s wire segments is shorter than a quarter wavelength the shortest length of straight wire that achieves resonance. In such circumstances, a T-antenna functions as a vertical, electrically short monopole antenna augmented with capacitive top-loading from its horizontal arms. The horizontal arms compensate, at least partially, for the reduced height of the vertical wire.\nThe left and right horizontal arms across the top of the ‘T’ carry equal but oppositely-directed currents in them, hence, far from the antenna, the radio waves generated in each arm tend to cancel with the waves from the other arm, with ground currents cancelling similarly. Since the horizontal wires radiate almost no power, effectively only the vertical section of the T-antenna radiates.\n\nThe horizontal arms help by raising the capacitance at the top of the vertical section closer to what it \"would\" be if the antenna were a full-size monopole, and drawing more current up through the vertical segment to feed current into the two arms. The increased currents in the vertical wire (\"see drawing at right\") effectively increase the antenna's radiation resistance and thus its efficiency. The horizontal top load wire can increase radiated power by 2 to 4 times (3 to 6 dB) for a given base current. Consequently a vertical wire crossed with a ‘T’ can radiate more power than a simple vertical monopole (‘l’) of the same height; reciprocally, a receiving T-antenna produces a greater response to incoming radio signals.\nHowever, the T-antenna is still typically not as efficient as a full-height vertical monopole, and has a higher and thus a narrower bandwidth. T-antennas are typically used at low frequencies where building a full-size quarter-wave high vertical antenna is not practical, and the vertical radiating wire is often very electrically short: Only a small fraction of a wavelength long, or less. An electrically short antenna has a base reactance that is capacitive, and in transmitting antennas this must be tuned-out by an added loading coil to make the antenna resonant so it can be fed power efficiently.\n\nThe top-load capacitance increases as more wires are added, so several parallel horizontal wires are often used, connected together at the center where the vertical wire attaches. Although the capacitance increases, because each wire’s electric field impinges on adjacent wires’ fields, it does not increase in proportion to the number of wires: Each added wire provides diminishing additional capacitance.\n\nSince the vertical wire is the actual radiating element, the antenna radiates vertically polarized radio waves in an omnidirectional radiation pattern, with equal power in all azimuthal directions. The axis of the horizontal wire makes little difference. The power is maximum in a horizontal direction or at a shallow elevation angle, decreasing to zero at the zenith. This makes it a good antenna at LF or MF frequencies, which propagate as ground waves with vertical polarization, but it also radiates enough power at higher elevation angles to be useful for sky wave (\"skip\") communication. The effect of poor ground conductivity is generally to tilt the pattern up, with the maximum signal strength at a higher elevation angle.\n\nIn the longer wavelength ranges where T-antennas are typically used, the electrical characteristics of antennas are generally not critical for modern radio receivers; reception is limited by natural noise, rather than by the signal power gathered by the receiving antenna.\n\nTransmitting antennas are different, and feedpoint impedance is critical:\nThe combination of reactance and resistance at the antenna feedpoint must be well matched to the impedance of the feedline, and beyond it, the transmitter's output stage. If mismatched, current sent from the transmitter to the antenna will reflect backwards from the connection point as “backlash current”, which at worst can damage the transmitter, and at least will reduce the power of the signal radiated from the antenna.\n\nAny monopole antenna that is shorter than has a capacitive reactance; the shorter it is, the higher that reactance, and the greater the proportion of the feed current that will be reflected back towards the transmitter.\nTo efficiently drive current into a short transmitting antenna it must be made resonant (reactance-free), if the top-section has not already done so. The capacitance is usually canceled out by an added loading coil or its equivalent; the loading coil is conventionally placed at the base of the antenna for accessibility, connected between the antenna and its feedline.\nThe horizontal top section of a T-antenna can also reduce the capacitive reactance at the feedpoint, substituting for a vertical section whose height would be about  its length; if it is long enough, it completely eliminates reactance, and obviates any need for a coil at the feedpoint.\n\nAt medium and low frequencies, the high antenna capacitance and the high inductance of the loading coil, compared to the short antenna’s low radiation resistance, makes the loaded antenna behave like a high tuned circuit, with a narrow bandwidth over which it will remain well matched to the transmission line, when compared to a monopole.\n\nTo operate over a large frequency range the loading coil often must be adjustable, and adjusted when the frequency is changed to limit the power reflected back towards the transmitter. The high also causes a high voltage on the antenna, which is maximum at the current nodes at the ends of the horizontal wire, roughly times the driving-point voltage. The insulators at the ends must be designed to withstand these voltages. In high power transmitters the output power is often limited by the onset of corona discharge from the wires.\n\nRadiation resistance is the equivalent resistance of an antenna due to its radiation of radio waves; for a full-length quarter-wave monopole the radiation resistance is around 25 Ohms. Any antenna that is short compared to the operating wavelength has a lower radiation resistance than a longer antenna; sometimes catastrophically so, far beyond the maximum performance improvement provided by a T-antenna. So at low frequencies even a T-antenna can have very low radiation resistance, often less than 1 Ohm, so the efficiency is limited by other resistances in the antenna and the ground system. The input power is divided between the radiation resistance and the ‘Ohmic’ resistances of the antenna+ground circuit, chiefly the coil and the ground. The resistance in the coil and particularly the ground system must be kept very low to minimize the power dissipated in them.\n\nIt can be seen that at low frequencies the design of the loading coil can be challenging: it must have high inductance but very low losses at the transmitting frequency (high ), must carry high currents, withstand high voltages at its ungrounded end, and be adjustable. It is often made of litz wire.\n\nAt low frequencies the antenna requires a good low resistance ground to be efficient. The RF ground is typically constructed as a \"star\" of many radial copper cables buried about 1 ft. in the earth, extending out from the base of the vertical wire, and connected together at the center. The radials should ideally be long enough to extend beyond the displacement current region near the antenna. At VLF frequencies the resistance of the soil becomes a problem, and the radial ground system is usually raised and mounted a few feet above ground, insulated from it, to form a counterpoise.\n\nThe power radiated (or received) by an electrically short vertical antenna like the T-antenna is proportional to the square of the \"effective height\" of the antenna, so the antenna should be made as high as possible. Without the horizontal wire, the RF current distribution in the vertical wire would decrease linearly to zero at the top (\"see drawing\" “a” \"above\"), giving an effective height of half the physical height of the antenna. With an ideal “infinite capacitance” top load wire, the current in the vertical would be constant along its length, giving an effective height equal to the physical height, therefore increasing the power radiated fourfold. So the power radiated (or received) by a T-antenna is up to four times that of a vertical monopole of the same height.\n\nThe radiation resistance of an ideal T-antenna with very large top load capacitance is\nso the radiated power is\nThis formula shows that the radiated power depends on the product of the base current and the effective height, and is used to determine how many ‘metre-amps’ are required to achieve a given amount of radiated power.\n\nThe equivalent circuit of the antenna (including loading coil) is the series combination of the capacitive reactance of the antenna, the inductive reactance of the loading coil, and the radiation resistance and the other resistances of the antenna-ground circuit. So the input impedance is\n\nAt resonance the capacitive reactance of the antenna is cancelled by the loading coil so the input impedance at resonance is just the sum of the resistances in the antenna circuit\n\nSo the efficiency of the antenna, the ratio of radiated power to input power from the feedline, is\n\nwhere\nIt can be seen that, since the radiation resistance is usually very low, the major design problem is to keep the other resistances in the antenna-ground system low to obtain the highest efficiency.\n\nThe \"multiple-tuned flattop antenna\" is a variant of the T-antenna used in high power low frequency transmitters to reduce ground power losses. It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several vertical radiator wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a loading coil. The antenna is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often at one end of the top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter.\n\nAlthough the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through parallel loading coils and grounds rather than one, the equivalent loading coil and ground resistance, and therefore the power dissipated in the loading coil and ground, is reduced to that of a simple T-antenna. The antenna was used in the powerful radio stations of the wireless telegraphy era but has fallen out of favor due to the expense of multiple loading coils.\n\n"}
{"id": "2046991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2046991", "title": "Dennis Levine", "text": "Dennis Levine\n\nDennis B. Levine (born August 5, 1952) is a strategic and financial corporate advisor. He was an investment banker and managing director at the Wall Street investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a major player in the merger and acquisition business in the 1980s. His career on Wall Street came to an end when he was charged with insider trading, making him one of the first of several high-profile defendants charged by U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani in the criminal Wall Street insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. As a result of a plea bargain, Levine pleaded guilty to insider trading and related charges, served two years in prison and made full restitution of his trading profits.\n\nIn 1991, Levine wrote the book \"Inside Out—an Insiders Account of Wall Street\". He accepted full responsibility for his actions and claimed that the vast majority of professionals on Wall Street followed the rules. In his lectures to students since then, he acknowledges his mistakes, stresses the importance of ethical standards to young professionals through his real-life experiences and has heightened awareness for ethical education programs at universities. \n\nLevine grew up in a middle-class Jewish family in Bayside in eastern Queens. He graduated from CUNY's Baruch College, obtaining an MBA from the same college in 1976.\n\nAfter being hired away from his career at Citibank in 1978, he joined Smith Barney's corporate finance department and worked in its Paris office specializing in mergers and acquisitions. He moved to Lehman Brothers in 1981. Shortly after Lehman was bought by American Express in 1985, Levine moved to Drexel as a managing director.\n\nLevine spent most of his career as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. He participated in many transactions throughout his career, three of which were among the more notable hostile takeovers of the 1980s — James Goldsmith's takeover of Crown Zellerbach, Costal Corporation's takeover of American Natural Resources, and Ron Perelman's takeover of Revlon. \n\nAfter his release from prison, Levine returned to the finance world as president of ADASAR Group, a financial consulting firm. Over the last 30+ years, Levine has worked as a global strategist for innovative technology trends, most recently focusing on controlled environment agriculture and sustainability, including food, water and energy systems. He also lectures at universities and organizations on a host of contemporary issues from business ethics to emerging technology developments.\n\nOver the years, Levine built a network of professionals at various Wall Street firms who engaged in insider trading. Participants exchanged and traded on inside information that they obtained through their work. Levine placed his trades through an account maintained under an assumed name at Bahamian subsidiaries of Swiss banks, using pay phones to prevent his calls from being traced. After briefly doing business with Pictet & Cie, he moved his business to Bank Leu in May 1980, eventually earning $10.6 million in illegal profits. Levine believed he was safe from detection. Like most Swiss banks, Bank Leu had a long tradition of secrecy. Also, the Bahamas had some of the strictest bank secrecy laws in the world; they forbade banks from disclosing any information about a customer's banking relationship to a third party.\n\nBank Leu officials soon realized that Levine was trading almost entirely on inside information. In order to have a piece of the action for themselves, some of them copied, or \"piggybacked\", his trades for their own accounts. In the process, they made a tidy profit on Levine's trades. To cover the trail, they broke up Levine's trades among several brokers. Unfortunately for Levine, they steered a large number of his trades through a broker at Merrill Lynch, who began piggybacking the trades for himself.\n\nIn May 1985, Merrill Lynch detected suspicious activity in that and two other brokers' personal trading accounts. An internal investigation led to Bank Leu. Unable to pierce the veil of secrecy, Merrill Lynch forwarded the affair to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bank officials suggested that Levine come up with reasons to justify the trades. However, they also forged or destroyed many documents related to Levine's activity — thus opening themselves to charges of obstruction of justice. Their story fell apart when the noted attorney Harvey Pitt, whom the bank had retained, noticed a huge gap between the actual statements of the bank's managed accounts and the omnibus records. At that point, the bank decided to co-operate with the SEC.\n\nThe Bahamian Attorney General, Paul Adderly, issued an opinion that stock trading was separate from banking. Therefore, since Bank Leu did not have a \"banking relationship\" with Levine, any disclosure about him would not violate Bahamian banking law. The bank was thus free to reveal Levine's name and he was arrested soon afterward. At the same time, he was sued by the SEC.\n\nOn June 5, 1986, Levine pleaded guilty to securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. Like all of the defendants charged, he agreed to co-operate with the government investigation and exposed the other members of his insider trading ring. Levine also settled the SEC's charges, agreeing to disgorge $11.5 million—at the time, the largest such penalty in SEC history. He also agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry. Levine also agreed to pay $2 million in back taxes out of the amount he disgorged to the SEC.\n\nAs Levine's arrest was unfolding his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert, was in the process of distributing its annual report which included a picture of Dennis Levine amongst other senior executives in the report. Copies of this original version of the annual report were recollected to the extent possible and it was replaced with a new annual report that did not include Levine's picture.\n\nSubsequently, the investigation implicated powerful arbitrageur Ivan Boesky, and information from the Boesky case also implicated another prominent player in the mergers and acquisitions circle, Martin Siegel. Both Boesky and Siegel subsequently pleaded guilty. Due in part to this co-operation, federal judge Gerald Goettel imposed a lenient sentence of two years in prison and a $362,000 fine. However, since Levine had been stripped of nearly all of his liquid assets by the SEC and IRS, Goettel did not \"commit\" the fines, meaning that he would not be held in contempt of court if he left prison without paying them. At sentencing, Goettel said that Levine had helped expose \"a nest of vipers on Wall Street\".\n\nLevine said that after his arrest, he seriously considered fighting the charges, claiming that the government circumvented Bahamian law in order to obtain most of the evidence against him. However, he said, the possibility of additional charges in a superseding indictment—possibly including the powerful Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act — and concern about the effects on his family - led him to conclude that this was a battle he could not win.\n\nThe SEC and the US Attorney's office conducted investigations that soon extended well beyond Levine's insider trading ring. There seemed to be an entire web of relationships among Wall Street professionals exchanging information and other favors, including the parking of stock, the accumulation of stock to pressure a firm's management and stock price manipulation, all unrelated to Levine. Well known market participants were soon caught up in the investigations, including Siegel, Boesky and the arbitrageur Robert Freeman. The investigations also indirectly led to Michael Milken who was highly influential in the junk bond market at the time.\n\n\n"}

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.\n\nJohnson Matthey traces its origins to 1817, when Percival Norton Johnson set up business as a gold assayer in London. In 1851 George Matthey joined the business and its name was changed to Johnson & Matthey. The following year the firm was appointed official assayer and refiner to the Bank of England. The company had branches in the cities of Birmingham and Sheffield to supply the jewellery and silverware and cutlery trade with raw materials and ancillary supplies, such as silver solder and flux, which it manufactured.\n\nIn 1874, the company was commissioned to manufacture the kilogram reference standard, made from 90% platinum and 10% iridium, and held in the \"Bureau International des Poids et Mesures\" (International Bureau of Weights and Measures).\n\nBeginning in 1957, the company published a journal, \"Platinum Metals Review\".\n\nIn the 1960s Johnson Matthey formed a subsidiary, Johnson Matthey Bankers (JMB), which took its seat in the London Gold Fixing. In the early 1980s the bank expanded its activities outside the bullion business and started making high-risk loans. Bank assets more than doubled between 1980 and 1984, and loans became concentrated to a few borrowers, including Mahmoud Sipra and his El Saeed group, Rajendra Sethia and ESAL Commodities, and Abdul Shamji. The quality of some of these loans turned out to be worse than expected, such as the £21 million lent to Abdul Shamji of Gomba Holdings (the then owner of Puddle Dock and the Mermaid Theatre in London). The size of the loans grew to exceed the level of the bank's capital. (Shamji was sentenced to 15 months in prison for lying about his assets during a High Court inquiry into the bank's collapse.)\n\nBecause JMB was one of five members of the London Gold Fixing, Bank of England officials were worried that if it became insolvent confidence in the other bullion banks would be undermined, and panic could spread to the rest of the British banking system. To prevent a wider banking crisis the Bank of England organized a rescue package on the evening of 30 September 1984, purchasing JMB for £1. Most of JMB's business was subsequently sold to Mase Westpac.\n\nIn 2008 Johnson Matthey acquired \"Argillon\", a business specialising in catalysts, for €214 million.\n\nIn October 2010 Johnson Matthey acquired \"InterCAT\", a supplier of fluid catalytic cracking additives for the petroleum refining industry, for $56.2 million. Also in 2010 Johnson Matthey opened a new £34 million European emission control catalyst plant in Skopje, (North Macedonia), which leveraged its manufacturing technology to produce catalysts for both light- and heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nThe company was one of the first FTSE 100 companies to produce an integrated annual report and won the Best Annual Report in the FTSE 100 in the ICSA Hermes Transparency in Governance Awards in 2012, which recognised how sustainability issues were ‘described in a way that clearly links them to business strategy and performance, rather than leaving them in a silo or on the sidelines.’\n\nIn 2014, the company was shortlisted for Business in the Community's Responsible Business of the Year Award for its Sustainability 2017 programme.\n\nIn 2015, Johnson Matthey sold its gold and silver refining operations to Asahi Holdings, Inc., a Japanese firm.\n\nJohnson Matthey is organised into four main sectors:\n\nIn August 2018, Johnson Matthey started the construction of a new factory in Gliwice. The plant covers an area of approximately 23,000 m2 and is costing about PLN 450 million. The project will create about 400 new jobs. The plant consists of two production lines which will manufacture a full range of advanced catalysts.\n\nIn December 2008 US subsidiary Johnson Matthey Inc was fined $2.25 million for a felony violation of the United States Clean Water Act, after admitting to violating the act at its Salt Lake City precious metals refining facility. The violation related to the selective screening of wastewater samples for compliance analysis. Following the charge Johnson Matthey Inc contributed $750,000 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and entered a three-year compliance agreement with the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n"}

{"id": "2047010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2047010", "title": "Anderson Report", "text": "Anderson Report\n\nThe Anderson Report is the colloquial name of the report of the Board of Inquiry into Scientology, an official inquiry into the Church of Scientology conducted for the State of Victoria, Australia. It was written by Kevin Victor Anderson QC and published in 1965. The report led to legislation attempting to ban Scientology in Victoria and similar legislation in several other States of Australia. No convictions were made under the legislation and Scientologists continued to practice their beliefs, although the headquarters was moved to South Australia. The legislation has been repealed in all States and subsequently Scientology was found to be a religion by the High Court of Australia.\n\nIn 1959, L. Ron Hubbard had set up the Church's headquarters at Saint Hill a few miles from East Grinstead in Surrey, England. The Church of Scientology had spread from its origin in USA to a number of other English-speaking countries and soon attracted attention. Several official inquiries were made into Scientology in England, Australia, and elsewhere and a number of reports published by respective governments in the late sixties and early seventies. The Anderson Report was the first of these.\n\nThe Victorian Legislative Council appointed a Board of Inquiry on 27 November 1963 in response to a Private Member's Bill proposed by John Galbally to prohibit Scientology in the State. At this time the Church was represented in Melbourne by the Hubbard Association of Scientologists International (HASI), which had premises at 157-159 Spring Street.\n\nA Board of Inquiry does not have the same legal status as a trial. It is not necessarily presided over by a judge or a magistrate and does not sit in a courtroom; witnesses are not subpoenaed but appear by invitation. It is not bound by the rules of evidence. The Board of Inquiry into Scientology consisted of Mr Anderson sitting alone, assisted by Mr. Gordon Just who was instructed by the Victorian Crown Solicitor. After an initial sitting on 6 December 1963, the Board sat in the theatrette of the National Herbarium of Victoria from 17 February 1964 to 21 April 1965.\n\nThe HASI was represented by counsel J.R. O'Shea and I.G. Abraham, who called as witnesses HASI staff members and many individuals who had received Scientology training and counselling. HASI files and publications were also tendered in evidence. They withdrew from the hearings on 12 November 1964 claiming biased conduct of the Inquiry by Anderson as the reason.\n\nTwo former Scientologists, Phillip Wearne and Douglas Moon, appeared as the main witnesses for the Committee for Mental Health and National Security (an \"ad hoc\" unincorporated organisation opposed to Scientology). They were represented by counsel Warren Fagan. Wearne, a publisher from South Yarra, told the inquiry that 'Scientologists planned to take over Australia, after establishing a \"Scientology Government\"' and that 'he first heard of the plan to take over Australia in 1960'. The method to be used 'was to infiltrate Government departments, political parties and other institutions, with scientologists getting jobs in these organisations', then 'after the move to \"clear Australia\" was completed, the aim was to take over the world'. Wearne said 'he was in a key position to carry out the scientology organisation's work as he had extensive connections in the Labour Party and Trade Union movements'. He also recalled 'a hallucination' that had 'developed after a \"scientology processing\"' in which he was eaten by a giant spider.\n\nPsychiatrist Dr. Ian Holland Martin, honorary federal secretary of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, gave evidence that the E-Meter 'used for Scientology' was a 'psycho-galvano-meter' and was 'dangerous in unqualified hands'. He said that if the E-meter 'was suggested to possess mysterious powers' to someone who did not understand that it had 'been thoroughly discredited as a lie detector' then 'that person would be suggestible to ideas foisted on him by the operator'. As a result, 'This kind of influence would heighten latent paranoic trends in persons who showed no significant emotional disturbance'. He also testified that the then 'world director' of Scientology L. Ron Hubbard 'showed paranoid delusions in his claim to have visited Venus and been in the Van Allen radiation belt around the earth'.\n\nDr Eric Cunningham Dax, Chairman of the Mental Health Authority of Victoria, and one of his staff, Dr. M.B. Macmillan, coordinated the evidence given by expert witnesses in medicine and psychiatry. Dax also conferred with Wearne before the latter gave evidence at the Inquiry.\n\nIn his own evidence to the inquiry Dax stated 'The Mental Health Authority did not wish to attack people for their belief...whatever they were, so long as they did not try to influence other people for purposes injurious to mental health'. '\"Scientology adherents' were 'sincere believers who were uncritical of the scheme's principles' and '\"Scientology subjected them to a form of blackmail' and 'brain-washing methods'. Dax described Scientology as 'a calculated money-raising scheme by false propaganda' and that 'Since 1961 he had been increasingly concerned by information reaching the Mental Health Authority about people paying large sums of money for \"Scientology\" courses'.\n\nThe Anderson Report concluded that \"Scientology is a delusional belief system, based on fiction and fallacies and propagated by falsehood and deception\" and that it \"is not, and does not claim to be, a religion\". He continues:\n\n\"Scientology is evil, its techniques evil, its practice a serious threat to the community, medically, morally and socially, and its adherents sadly deluded and often mentally ill.\"\n\nAnderson acknowledged the emotional tone of his report, justifying it as follows:\n\nIf there should be detected in this Report a note of unrelieved denunciation of scientology, it is because the evidence has shown its theories to be fantastic and impossible, its principles perverted and ill-founded, and its techniques debased and harmful. [...] While making an appeal to the public as a worthy system whereby ability, intelligence and personality may be improved, it employs techniques which further its real purpose of securing domination over and mental enslavement of its adherents. It involves the administration by persons without any training in medicine or psychology of quasi-psychological treatment, which is harmful medically, morally and socially.\nResponses from government representatives across Australia to both to the findings of the report, and on the subject of scientology in general, were reported the following day. The Premier of Victoria Henry Bolte, who had set up the inquiry, described it as 'conclusive enough for action to be taken'. In New South Wales, the Minister for Health said that scientology 'had no proper background or scientific basis' and he would 'take such steps as are necessary to stop this organisation from taking root and gaining influence in the community'. In Western Australia, Dr. A. S. Ellis, Director of Mental Health Services, described scientology as 'a dangerous pseudo-science which catered for emotional cripples'. He added that scientologists were 'credulous, insecure and neurotic people who were looking for a prop' and scientology gave this to them 'at a price' but raised 'false hopes' and delayed 'proper psychiatric treatment'.\n\nIn October 1965, Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard was quoted as saying that the Board of Inquiry into Scientology was a 'kangaroo court' because 'They had their conclusions drawn long before they held the first hearing'. He suggested that the inquiry was 'illegal in its conduct under common law' and that anything similar in England would be 'laughed out of existence'. He put this down to Australia being 'young'. He added:\n\n\"In 1942, a senior naval officer in Northern Australia, by a fluke of fate, I helped save them from the Japanese. For the sake of scientology there I will go on helping them. They have a lot to learn. I feel sorry for them. They are afraid.'\n\nThe 'Hubbard Communications Office' at Saint Hill Manor in England also issued a statement criticizing the inquiry process and threatening legal action. They claimed Hubbard 'was forbidden to appear at the hearing' and that testimony from him and 'our witnesses' were not heard. They argued 'The people investigating it are religiously biased' and that 'witnesses of the opposition' had been allowed to collude 'before the hearing'. They also stated 'We intend to sue any paper publishing the findings as an accessory to libel and slander'.\n\nIn 1967 the Church of Scientology published \"Kangaroo Court\", a critique of the conduct of the Board of Inquiry, alleging collusion between witnesses and alleging bias by Anderson and Dax.\n\nA suit was brought against Anderson and his assistant Gordon Just who produced the report, in 1971. The citations in the Victorian Reports are: Hubbard Association of Scientologists v Anderson [1971] VR 788; Hubbard Association of Scientologists v Anderson [1972] VR 340 (appeal from [1971] VR 740); Hubbard Association of Scientologists International v Anderson and Just (No 2) [1972] VR 577. The Victorian Parliament passed special legislation to give the two immunity from these writs.\n\nJane Kember, a senior Scientologist who was later convicted on several criminal charges in relation to Scientology's 'Operation Snow White' tried to get the report removed from a library. She wrote a memo about 'handling' Paulette Cooper (and her critical book about Scientology) in 1972. Part 12 of the memo asks:\n\n\"The library in D.C. has a copy of the Melbourne Inquiry Report. Paulette recommends this. Why is the copy still there? Please get it removed\"\nThe Anderson Report is regarded by some as controversial, as evidenced in the Australian Government's Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report regarding freedom of religion and belief. The Anderson Report was the basis of the \"Psychological Practices Act, 1965\". However, this Act was amended in 1982 to remove all references to Scientology and was repealed in 1987.\n\nSimilar reports were conducted in:\nThis list of reports is not exhaustive.\n\n\n"}
