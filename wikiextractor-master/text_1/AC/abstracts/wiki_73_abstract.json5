    "title": "Julius Exner",
    "text": "The younger Exner was interested in drawing and painting from an early age and was put in private training after his confirmation. He began to study at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (\"Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi\") April 1839, where he intended on becoming a history painter. He caught the attention of Professor J. L. Lund, from whom he learned history painting. He studied later on with Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, closely linked to the Golden Age of Danish Painting and commonly referred to as the Father of Danish Painting. \n\nIn 1844 he exhibited his first painting \"\"Fra Kunstakademiets figursal\"\" (\"From the Art Academy's Plaster Cast Collection\") painted in 1843; the painting depicts a student sketching a plaster cast of a statue in the Academy's plaster cast collection, another student in the background moves between the figures.\n\nHe won the Academy's little silver medallion in 1843, and the large silver medallion in 1845. In these early years he exhibited several history paintings as well a number of portraits. One of these portraits, a portrait of his sister, won him the Academy's Neuhausens prize (\"Neuhausens pr\u00e6mie\") in 1847.\n\nIn 1849 one of his history paintings, \"\"Thyra Danebod fors\u00f8ger at formilde Gorm den Gamles vrede mod nogle fangne kristne\"\" (\"Thyra Danebod Tries to Placate Gorm the Elder's Anger with Imprisoned Christians\"), was purchased by the Danish Royal Painting Collection, now the Danish National Gallery (\"Statens Museum for Kunst\"). Another painting from 1851, \"\"Marsk Stigs D\u00f8tre\"\" (\"Marsk Stig's Daughters\"), was commissioned by Count Frederik Christian Julius Knuth to hang at Knuthenborg Palace. The Count was generous with Exner, not only paying him well but providing him with a studio for several years. Both of these painting depict an ancient Danish history and legend.\n\nBut even Exner admitted to having an irrational \"emotional desire to become a history painter\" (\"\"usalige lyst til at blive historiemaler\"\"). Niels Lauritz H\u00f8yen, critic, Academy professor and advocate of a national art movement, helped influence Exner's future artistic direction, and Exner began seeking out the unique Danish folktypes living in the county as artistic subjects. This brought him to Amager, an island south of Copenhagen, where Dutch farmers had settled in 1521, but who were still relatively unknown to their fellow Danes. There he painted his masterly, life-size \"\"En Amagerkone, der t\u00e6ller sine Penge efter\"\" (\"A Woman from Amager Counting Her Money\"), which was exhibited in 1852, and was purchased by the National Collection.\n\nHe was not only influenced by the national art movement promoted by H\u00f8yen, but also by the strong sense of patriotism during those times after the Napoleonic Wars, and by the general use of particularly \"Danish\" themes in not only the visual arts, but also in literature and theatre. These themes focused on the folktypes in various areas of Denmark, especially those living in the country and on the farm. In the visual arts a generation of art\u00edsts had been already exploring such themes as typical Danish landscapes, and the depiction of Danish and Nordic themes, mythological stories and history. Many of the artists in the preceding generation were students of Eckersberg, and comprised the group of artists collectively known as the Golden Age of Danish Painting artists. They had been affected by Eckersberg's stress on attentive study and representation of Danish nature, as well as by the technical skills he taught them to achieve those goals.\n\nA follow up painting to his first Amager painting was \"\"Et Bes\u00f8g hos Bedstefaderen\"\" (\"A Visit to Grandfather's House\") painted in 1853, which assured him a successful career with its wide popularity and many reproductions. He won a Thorvaldsens exhibition medallion for the work, and the painting was purchased for the National Collection.\n\nHe painted a number of painting on Amager over a period of years, and his skills grew as he depicted a combination of artistic challenges: increasingly complicated groups of people, a view out to the open land, colorful folk costumes, and the interiors of old farmer homes. These paintings attracted an interested public, who was fascinated by this close-up look at the exotic foreigners living in Denmark side-by-side with them. It was a chance to come into the home of strangers and see their everyday life. Exner was skilled and portrayed his subjects with affection, interest and gentle humour.\n\nHe often traveled to the countryside during the summers to do live studies from nature, as was common practice in these times, working up finished paintings in the studio during the winter. And he also began seeking out themes in other locations on Sj\u00e6lland.as well, which resulted in \"\"Et Bondegilde i Hedeboegnen\"\" (\"A Party on the Farm in the Hedebo Area\") painted in 1856, as well as others of the same ilk. One of his paintings \"\"Lille pige lader en gammel mand lugte til en blomst\"\" (\"A Little Girl Lets an Old Man Smell a Flower\") painted in 1856, proved to be the start of Heinrich Hirschsprung's collection (the museum now known as the Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen), when he purchased it in 1866.\n\nHe received a two-year travel stipend from the Academy (1857\u20131858) for a student travel to Italy, which took him also to Dresden, Vienna, Switzerland and Paris, in addition to the Italian cities of Venice, Parma, Florence, Naples and Rome. He occasionally painted depictions of Italy, including his well-known \"\"En gondol\"\" (\"A Gondola\") from 1859, a view looking out from the dark interior of a covered gondola. A young woman at the left-hand side of the canvas peers out from the dark; a gondolier on the right-hand side of the central archway leans in towards the center of the painting, bathed in light. Beyond is a glimpse of the waterway and other boats.\n\nHe illustrated poet Christian Winther's \"\"Billeder og Vers\"\" (\"Pictures and Verses\") in 1862. He married Inger Henriette Sophie Jensine Ringsted on 15 June 1863.\n\nHe traveled to Sweden several times between 1863\u20131864, and on his travels in Denmark he reached Jutland's northernmost point-- Skagen\u2014in 1867, the fishing village that, a generation later, would play host to the group of artists known as the Skagen Painters.\n\nIn 1864 he became a member of the Academy in Denmark, and in 1866 the Academy in Stockholm, Sweden. He painted another famous painting of Amager folk, the cheerful \"\"Blindebuk\"\" (\"Blind Man's Bluff\") depicting a farmhouse interior with children at play, in 1866. In an age where industrialisation was fast encroaching on traditional farmlife, Exner depicted a timeless vision of several generations of farm folk, gathered around in their idealised and cheerful house, self-sufficient and happy. A later generation of artists would rebel against this idealisation with their realistic depictions of want and need among the same types of people.\n\nHe also painted portraits of the day's prosperous and prominent, such as Jenny Adler, wife of businessman, banker and politician David Baruch Adler, with her daughters in 1868, and the elderly poet \"\"Christian Winther paa Spaseretur\"\" (\"Christian Winther on a Walking Tour\") in 1869.\n\nHe was named Professor at the Danish Academy in 1876 after having been an assistant professor in the School of Model Painting since 1872.\n\nStarting in the late 1870s Exner began painting themes from Fan\u00f8, a Danish island in the North Sea off the west coast of Jutland, the Danish mainland. He came to the island for the first time in 1877. He and his family spent the summers there annually for many years to come. He had a studio at S\u00f8nderho Kro. There he found a group of people whose lives interested him deeply, a folk who were fast becoming extinguished in the social changes of that time. These themes made excellent subjects for his painting until his death.\n\nHis work was exhibited at the world exhibition in Paris in 1878.\n\nHe received a Treschow award in 1887. He became a member of the Exhibition Committee at Charlottenborg in 1879, and was named head of the committee in 1890. He served in this capacity five years. He was a member of the School Council (\"Skoler\u00e5det\") between 1883\u20131905, was Treasurer from 1884, and member of the Academy Council (\"Akademir\u00e5det\") from 1887.\n\nHe painted several self-portraits in his final years, one in 1906 and one in 1910. He died on 15 November 1910 in Copenhagen two weeks shy of his 85th birthday. He is buried in Holmen's Cemetery in central Copenhagen.\n\nHe exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition annually from 1844 until his death in 1910, with few exceptions.\n\nHis works were exhibited at the Nordic Art Exhibition in Copenhagen (1872, 1883, 1888) and in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1881, at the first International Art Exhibition in Vienna, Austria in 1882 and at the International Art Exhibition in Berlin in 1891.\n\nHis work has been shown posthumously both in Denmark and internationally in numerous exhibitions of Danish art, including an exhibition in Paris in 1928.\n\nHis works are in the collection of many Danish museums including the National Art Museum (\"Statens Museum for Kunst\"), the Hirschsprung Collection, and local art museums in Aarhus, Randers, Ribe, Amager, northern Jutland, Frederiksborg CountyFrederiksborg and Funen.\n\nExner was a master of composition setting up a lively combination of characters, costumes, and interiors, along with an underlying anecdote, that showed an inspiration of Dutch and German paintings. He was interested in the people he portrayed. He idealised their lives, and his work led to the rebellion known as realism.\n\nOther Danish genre painters of his generation were Christen Dalsgaard and Frederik Vermehren. They all depicted Danish country folk.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "The Alphabetum Kaldeorum (\"alphabet of the Chaldeans\") is one of the best known ciphers of the Middle Ages. Its name refers to the Chaldea, whose inhabitants during the medieval era were reputed to have mysterious and magical knowledge.\n\nIt can be found in a complete version, together with other non-Latin alphabets, in a manuscript from the year 1428, now in the library at the University of Munich (Cod. 4\u00ba 810, fol. 41v). However, its origins lie clearly in an earlier time, as some examples of its practical use demonstrate.\n\nThe Alphabetum Kaldeorum was meant primarily for the encipherment of diplomatic correspondence; its alphabet implies that predominantly Latin texts were coded: u and v are equated; w was to be written as double v; j is missing. For frequently arising letters the Alphabetum Kaldeorum provides several different versions, which were used at random so that a decipherment attempt using the classical frequency analysis method should fail. \"Nulla\", cipher-letters with no plaintext assignment which were to be ignored, were also often added to the enciphered texts to further render frequency-analysis useless.\n\nA possible author of the Alphabetum Kaldeorum is Duke Rudolf IV of Austria (1339\u20131365), who attributed an Indian origin to them; the letters of the Alphabetum Kaldeorum are probably not, however, at all related to any writing common in India, and are actually independent creations.\n\nEven Rudolf's gravestone in the Stephansdom in Vienna carries an inscription enciphered using the Alphabetum Kaldeorum, which gives the names and titles of the duke.\n"

    "title": "Swept Away (1974 film)",
    "text": "Swept Away (; the full English title is \"Swept Away... by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August\"; later truncated to simply \"Swept Away\" in subsequent releases) is a 1974 Italian adventure comedy-drama romance film written and directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller and starring Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato.\n\nThe film follows a wealthy woman whose yachting vacation with friends in the Mediterranean Sea takes an unexpected turn when she and one of the boat's crew are separated from the others and they become stranded on a deserted island. The woman's capitalist beliefs and the man's communist convictions clash, but during their struggle to survive their situation, their social roles are reversed.\n\n\"Swept Away\" was released to divisive but largely positive reviews and went on to receive the 1975 National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Award for Top Foreign Film.\n\nAn arrogant wealthy capitalist named Raffaella (Mariangela Melato) is vacationing on a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea with friends\u2014swimming, sunbathing, and talking incessantly about the virtues of her class and the worthlessness of the political left. Her nonstop political monologue infuriates one of the underclass deckhands on her yacht, Gennarino (Giancarlo Giannini), a dedicated Communist who manages to restrain his opinions to avoid upsetting his boss and losing his good job. Despite her humiliating insults, Gennarino agrees to take her out on a dinghy late in the evening to see the rest of her friends who have gone ahead without her. On their way, the outboard motor gives out, leaving them stranded in the middle of the sea with no land in sight.\n\nAfter a night at sea, Gennarino manages to get the motor running again but has no idea where they are or how to get to land. Eventually they spot an island and head toward it, destroying their dinghy in the process. On land, they discover that there is no one on the island except them, and they are effectively shipwrecked. Accustomed to having everything done for her, Raffaella begins ordering Gennarino about, but this is the final straw for him and he snaps, refusing to assist her any longer. Raffaella reacts with a string of insults, but he gives as good as he gets, and they split up to explore the island on their own.\n\nMuch better suited to island life than Raffaella, Gennarino is soon catching and cooking lobsters. Gradually their roles become reversed. While she has to rely on him for food, Gennarino wants her to be his slave, convinced that women are born to serve men. He even forces her to endure the indignity of washing his underwear. When she reacts in angry defiance, he slaps her around. Undeniably attracted to Raffaella, Gennarino attempts to rape her, but then changes his mind, deciding that it would be more satisfying if she gave herself to him willingly. Later that evening, Raffaella does approach him and both willingly engage in repeated, passionate, sexual relations. He wants her to fall in love with him, and as their differences are gradually forgotten, they reach a kind of balance, although Gennarino still hits her and she takes the more subservient role. Eventually they spot a ship, and although they are both reluctant to disrupt their newfound paradise, they signal the ship and are rescued.\n\nAfter returning home, they soon revert to their former lives and social roles\u2014she once again embracing the upper-class lifestyles of her friends; he returning to a life of a lower-class worker and husband. They both understand something profound and unsettling about what they've experienced, but Raffaella is unwilling to abandon the society of privilege that has such a strong hold on her. Abandoned by the object of his desires, Gennarino returns defeated to his sad life and loveless marriage\u2014far removed from an idyllic island in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\nThe scenarios of the film are glimpses of Sardinia. The film was shot along the eastern Sardinian coast, in the province of Nuoro. The beach of the landing of the two shipwrecked is Cala Fuili, in the municipality of Dorgali. The beach of Cala Luna, straddling the municipality of Dorgali and that of Baunei, has been set for another good part of the shooting. The Carunchio refuge and the most sensual scenes were filmed in the dunes of Capo Comino, a town in the municipality of Siniscola.\n\nIn his review in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", American film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, his highest rating. Ebert wrote that the film \"resists the director's most determined attempts to make it a fable about the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and persists in being about a man and a woman. On that level, it's a great success.\"\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called \"Swept Away\" \"the most successful fusion of Miss Wertmuller's two favorite themes, sex and politics, which are here so thoroughly and so successfully tangled that they become a single subject, like two people in love.\" Canby went on to write:\nSome reviewers criticized the film as deeply misogynistic, with its themes of violence against women, subjugation, and rape. Anthony Kaufman, in \"The Village Voice\", called it \"possibly the most outrageously misogynist film ever made by a woman.\"\n\nOther reviewers and analysts responded that those who focused on the misogyny simply didn't understand the film's message about class warfare. James Berardinelli defended the film, writing \"Those who view this film casually may easily mistake it for a male fantasy...The reality, however, is that Wertmuller is exhibiting the courage to show things that other filmmakers shy away from.\" John P. Lovell wrote \"The sexual violence can be analyzed as political violence within the framework of patriarchal politics and the film's concern with a symbolic presentation of social revolt.\"\n\nIn her review in \"Jump Cut\", Tania Modleski dismissed those justifications, contending that critics would not have been so kind to those who made films which reinforced stereotypes\u2014culminating in violent subjugation\u2014about oppressed ethnic groups, so there was no justification for critics to praise a rape-fantasy film. Responding to the film's message about class warfare, she wrote \"So even if Wertmuller wanted to convey only a political message, she has clouded rather than clarified the issues. She should have made both parties male.\"\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 65% positive rating from top film critics based on 17 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.\n\nThe film was remade in 2002 as \"Swept Away\", starring Madonna and directed by her then-husband Guy Ritchie. The film was a critical and commercial failure. The male lead was played by Adriano Giannini, the son of Giancarlo Giannini.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "USS \"William Jones\" (DD-308), a \"Clemson\"-class destroyer in the United States Navy, named for William Jones.\n\n\"William Jones\" was laid down on 2 October 1918, at San Francisco, California, by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. She was launched on 9 April 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Ernest P. McRitchie, the wife of the assistant naval architect at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, and was commissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 30 September 1920, with Lieutenant Commander C. E. Rosendahl in temporary command. Lt. Comdr. J. G. B. Gromer took command on 16 November.\n\nInitially assigned to Division 34, Squadron 12, Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet, \"William Jones\" operated off the west coast on duty in connection with the Officers' Engineering School until October 1921, cruising as far north as Seattle, Washington and as far south as the waters off the Panama Canal Zone. Assigned to Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet, early in 1922, the destroyer operated with this force over the next seven years. Her operations took the ship up and down the west coast from Puget Sound to the Panama Canal. She took part in fleet maneuvers, exercises in torpedo firing and gunnery, and battle practices. In March 1925, she joined the Fleet for Fleet Problem V during which she screened the Battle Fleet units off Baja California, as they carried out maneuvers designed to practice protective screening, seizing and occupying a lightly defended position, and fueling at sea.\n\nLater that summer, \"William Jones\" served as one of the ships plane-guarding for the PN-9 flying boat flight to Hawaii. None of the planes actually flew all the way to Hawaii due a variety of mishaps. One, PN-9 number 3, was forced down by a malfunctioning fuel line. \"William Jones\" located her and went to her assistance, later towing her into San Francisco harbor on 1 September. PN-9 number 1, flown by Commander John Rodgers, did eventually reach Hawaii after a remarkable voyage in which her enterprising crew stripped the fabric from one wing and used it to fabricate a sail which propelled the floating aircraft to Oahu.\n\nFrom 5 September to 15 September, \"William Jones\" participated in the Diamond Jubilee celebrations at San Francisco before resuming her operations and exercises off the west coast. She worked along the Pacific coast until 3 March and 4 March 1926, when she transited the Panama Canal to take part in maneuvers with the Fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. She visited a succession of east coast ports and returned to the west coast on 30 June, when she moored again at San Diego, California.\n\n\"William Jones\" conducted a reserve training cruise to Alaskan waters from 7 July to 21 July 1928, pausing at Ketchikan, Juneau, and Sitka. After the ship's return to San Diego, she participated in tactical exercises off Point Loma and, later, in joint Army-Navy maneuvers off Port Angeles, Washington, in July 1929.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the joint exercises, the destroyer arrived at San Diego late in August 1929 and remained inactive there until decommissioned on 24 May 1930. In accordance with the London treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armaments, the warship was struck from the Navy list on 13 August 1930 and sold for scrap on 25 February 1932.\n\n"

    "text": "Pieter Cramer (21 May 1721 (baptized) \u2013 28 September 1776), was a wealthy Dutch merchant in linen and Spanish wool, remembered as an entomologist. Cramer was the director of the Zealand Society, a scientific society located in Flushing, and a member of \"Concordia et Libertate\", based in Amsterdam. This literary and patriotic society, where Cramer gave lectures on minerals, commissioned and/or financed the publishing of his book \"De uitlandsche Kapellen\", on foreign (exotic) butterflies, occurring in three parts of the world Asia, Africa and America.\n\nCramer assembled an extensive natural history collection that included seashells, petrifications, and insects of all orders. Many were colourful butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), collected in countries where the Dutch had colonial or trading links, such as Surinam, Ceylon, Sierra Leone and the Dutch East Indies.\n\nCramer decided to get a permanent record of his collection and so engaged the painter Gerrit Wartenaar to draw his specimens. He also arranged for Wartenaar to draw butterflies and moths belonging to other keen Lepidoptera collectors in the Netherlands. One of them was stadtholder-prince William V of Orange. Hans Willem Baron Rengers and Joan Raye, the son of the former governor in Surinam, were among the others. Such was the quality of the illustrations that Caspar Stoll encouraged him to publish the set of drawings.\n\nCramer, a bachelor, was born in Amsterdam, and lived on Oudezijds Voorburgwal at no. 131, close to the Oude Kerk. In 1760 he had bought the house, then known as \"\"the Three Kings\"\". On 5 September 1774 he made his will with a stipulation that the drawings should be available to the publisher. So all the drawings went to his nephew Anthony van Rensselaer, under the condition that these drawings be printed by the bookseller Johannes Baalde. As a result, \"De Uitlandsche Kapellen\" was published 1775\u20131782. It consisted of 33 parts, each one issued at intervals of three months to the subscribers, in four volumes. All of the drawings were accompanied by descriptions of the insects. \n\nCramer died \"of high fevers\" in 1776 after eight issues (Vol. I) had been published, leaving responsibility for finishing the project to Van Rensselaar and Stoll. Stoll is supposed to be the author of the text from page 29 of the fourth volume onwards.\n\n\"De Uitlandsche Kapellen\" is a key work in the history of entomology. Beautifully illustrated with fine life-size hand-coloured engravings of Lepidoptera from Asia, Africa and America, it was the first book on exotic Lepidoptera to use the then new system developed by Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778) for naming and classifying animals. Over 1658 butterfly species were described and illustrated on 396 (or 400) plates, Cramer and Stoll naming and illustrating many new species for the first time.\nCramer's collections were broken up after his death and sold, auctioned and donated to institutions and individuals. The Dutch \"Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum\" came to own a substantial number of his specimens and bought part of Cramer's collection from Joan Raye, heer van Breukelerwaert.\n\n\"De uitlandsche Kapellen voorkomende in de drie Waereld-Deelen Asia, Africa en America \u2013 Papillons exotiques des trois parties du monde l'Asie, l'Afrique et l'Amerique\" (1775\u20131782).\n\n"

    "title": "Ernest Flagg",
    "text": "Ernest Flagg (February 6, 1857 \u2013 April 10, 1947) was a noted American architect in the Beaux-Arts style. He was also an advocate for urban reform and architecture's social responsibility.\n\nFlagg was born in Brooklyn, New York. His father Jared Bradley Flagg was an Episcopal priest and a notable painter. Ernest left school at 15 to work as an office boy on Wall Street. After working with his father and brothers in real estate for a few years, he designed duplex apartment plans in 1880 with the architect Philip Gengembre Hubert, for the co-operative apartment buildings Hubert was known for.\n\nCornelius Vanderbilt II, Flagg's cousin through his marriage to Alice Claypoole Gwynne, was impressed by Flagg's work and sent him to study at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1889\u20131891, under his patronage.\n\nIn 1891, Flagg began his architectural practice in New York, greatly influenced by his knowledge of the French ideas of architectural design, such as structural rationalism.\n\nDuring this time he joined with John Prentiss Benson to create Flagg & Benson, which later became Flagg, Benson & Brockway with the addition of Albert Leverett Brockway. FB&B designed St. Luke's Hospital in New York City.\n\nIn 1894, he established the architectural firm of Flagg & Chambers with Walter B. Chambers, whom he met in Paris. Usually Flagg alone is credited for some of the work he and Chambers worked on together, such as the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Pomfret School in Connecticut which he saw as \"part of the process of evolution that would contribute to the creation of a national style of architecture.\u201d\n\nLouisa Flagg Scribner, Flagg's sister, was the wife of Charles Scribner II. Through this familial connection, Flagg designed six structures located in Manhattan for the publishing family.\nFlagg is probably best known for his design of the Singer Tower. Completed in 1908, it was then the tallest office building in the world, at 612 feet. Faithful to his Beaux-Arts training, Flagg allowed space around the tall building for light to enter, which was unusual for the time.\nThough Flagg is best known for his large institutional designs, he was also interested in producing modest, attractive homes affordable to average Americans. He developed innovative techniques toward that end and in 1922 published the book \"Small Houses, Their Economic Design and Construction\". He packaged these techniques and ideas into the \"Flagg System\", and collaborated with builders scattered across the U.S. to build them.\n\nHis contributions to zoning and height regulations were essential to New York's first laws governing this aspect of the city's architecture. Flagg argued in favor of zoning laws which would regulate the height and setback of buildings, to allow light and air to reach the streets below them. He was a president of the New York Society of Beaux-Arts Architects. A small collection of Flagg's personal and professional papers is held in the Department of Drawings & Archives at Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University.\n\nThe homes that Flagg designed are modest, low to the ground, with stone walls, and often with steep roofs, distinctive ridge dormers, and round-capped chimneys. Their styles suggest Tudor Revival, Cotswold Cottage, or French Provincial to various extents. Flagg generally considered surface decoration \"sham,\" and preferred to suggest styles with the general form of the building, adding interest with chimneys and dormers.\n\nAs mentioned above, Flagg aimed to make attractive homes affordable to average families, and he did this by the following means:\n\n\n\nFlagg tested some of his designs for modest homes on his Staten Island estate, and many of these demonstration models are still in use. Afterwards, more were built around New York and across the U.S. Flagg worked with particular builders, training them on his system. The builder sent the clients' requirements to Flagg, he sent back plans, the builder and local inspectors adjusted the plans for local building codes, and the builder constructed the home. In the Milwaukee area over two dozen of these homes were built from 1924 to 1926, and they survive largely intact, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nErnest Flagg married Margaret E. Bonnell on June 27, 1899 in New York City. They had one daughter, Margaret Elizabeth, who became a well-respected small-scale portrait painter and is known professionally as Betsy Flagg Melcher.\n\nIn 1912, Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Flagg were on their way to a party held by Stowe Phelps, a fellow architect, when their limousine struck and killed a boy (James McNamara) who had suddenly skated in front of the car. The couple drove the boy to the hospital but he died en route.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This legendary dynasty was said to be descended from moon-related deities (\"Soma\" or \"Chandra\").\n\nAccording to the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\", Pururavas was the son of Budha (himself often described as the son of Soma) and the gender-switching deity Ila (born as the daughter of Manu). Pururavas's great-grandson was Yayati, who had five sons named Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, and Puru. These seem to be the names of five Indo-Aryan tribes as described in the Vedas.\n\nAccording to the \"Mahabharata\", the dynasty's progenitor Ila ruled from Prayag, and had a son Shashabindu who ruled in the country of Bahli. Ila's descendants were also known as the Ailas or Chandravansha.\n\nIn Hindu texts, the Kurukshetra war that form the subject of the Indian Epic Mahabarata, was largely fought between rival branches of the Lunar Dynasty, famously resulting in the hesitation of Arjuna away from war and the reprimand of his mentor Krishna. Krishna reminds Arjuna that Dharma stands above everything and the text forms an integral cultural cornerstone for all four Kshatriya houses.\n\nBy the conclusion of the Kurukshetra war most of the Yadhuvanshi lineage is in peril. The sinking of Dwarka sees the destruction of the entire Yaduvanshi lineage with the exception of Vajranabh who was saved by Arjuna and later becomes the King of Mathura. As the only surviving grandson of Krishna all branches claiming descent from Krishna descend through him.\n"

As this game involves carrying off cards with a fixed sum, it belongs to the same family of games as Pyramid.\n\nThe cards are dealt face up into twelve columns, from left to right. The first four columns therefore receive an extra card. The exposed top cards of each column are available for play.\n\nAs denoted by the game's name, the object is to discard pairs of cards that total fourteen. Jacks value eleven, queens twelve, and kings thirteen, all others (including the ace) at face value. So the combination of cards to be discarded are as follows:\n\nOnce a card has been discarded, the card under it becomes available. The game is won when all cards are discarded.\n\nStrategy of Fourteen Out involves identifying pairs that cannot be matched because of their position, and preemptively selecting other eligible matches. Potential difficulties arise when pairs are found in the same pile, or when two different matches are in potentially mutually blocking positions.\n\nColumns may be stacked rather than cascaded, thus obscuring not-yet-active cards. This results in considerably more blind play.\n"

    "title": "Pentecostal Assemblies of the World",
    "text": "The Pentecostal Assemblies of The World, Inc. (or P.A.W.) is one of the world's largest Apostolic (Oneness) Pentecostal Christian denominations, and is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. The P.A.W. adheres to the non-trinitarian theology of Oneness. While it began in 1906 with Trinitarian beliefs, it was re-organized in 1916 as Oneness Pentecostal, thus making it the oldest organization of this type.\n\nThe origin of the P.A.W. can be traced to the teachings of Charles Parham in Topeka, Kansas (1901), and the Azusa Street Revival led by William Joseph Seymour in Los Angeles, California (1906-1909). During this time it was a loose fellowship of churches that were united by the infilling of the believer with the Holy Ghost, and adherence to the doctrine of holiness.\n\nFor the next few years, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World focused upon general meetings and the development of its organizational structure. \"The late Bishop Morris E. Golder wrote: \"The original organization bearing the name of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World came into existence in the year of 1906 in the city of Los Angeles, State of California.\"\" This was also the position asserted by former Presiding Bishop of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World Ross Paddock. He declared that after one year of being organized, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World had its first annual business meeting and that, at the same time, it was Trinitarian in its doctrine and liturgy of water baptism.\n\nAccording to Dr. David D. Bundy, a Pentecostal historian at the Christian Theological Seminary, as early as 1907, a white Baptist minister in Los Angeles, was preaching non-Trinitarian water baptism in the Name of Jesus. According to Dr. Deborah Sims LeBlanc, William and Maggie Bowdan, the parents of former Assistant Presiding Bishop Frank Bowdan, were baptized in the Name of Jesus after the Azusa Street Mission Revival (1906-1909).\n\nAs an outgrowth of the Asuza Street movement, a fellowship of \"pentecostal assemblies\" met in October 1907 in Los Angeles, and followed-up with similar meetings in subsequent years. This fellowship was known as the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. J. J. Frazee (the P.A.W.'s first General Overseer) and G. T. Haywood participated in these meetings.\n\nIn 1913, hundreds of preachers attended a camp meeting in Arroyo Seco, California. Evangelist R.E. McAlister was selected to preach on the subject of water baptism at a baptismal service. He began speaking on the different modes of baptism, mentioning triune immersion by which the candidate was immersed three times face forward. He summed it up by \u201cthey justify their method, by saying that baptism is in the likeness of Christ's death, and make a point from scripture that Christ bowed his head when he died.\u201d and to them, it was necessary to baptize once for each person in the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Ghost). He concluded his message abruptly by saying that the scriptural answer to this was that the Apostles invariably baptized all their converts a single time in \"the name of the Lord Jesus Christ\", and the words Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were never used by the early church in Christian baptism. McAlister was taken aside at the time and told not to preach this new theory about the \u201cbaptismal formula.\u201d However, many hearing McAlister speak received the new revelation of the name Jesus. Three important men who attended and were influenced by this new revelation; were Frank J. Ewart, G. T. Haywood, and Glenn A. Cook.\n\nFor an entire year (1913-1914), intense and bitter debate raged within the Association regarding the Godhead and the \"new issue.\" Essentially, there were two questions around which the debate was centered:\n<br>(1) \"Is there one God, or are there three distinct persons in the Godhead? and <br>(2) How then, should an individual be baptized - \"in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost\", or in \"the Name of Jesus?\"\n\nBy the spring of 1914, Ewart accepted the newfound truth regarding this formula and became one of its leading advocates. He reached the conclusion that the singular \u201cname\u201d in Matthew 28:19 was Jesus Christ, and that the one true God who had revealed himself as Father, in the Son, and as the Holy Spirit was none other than Jesus Christ. To support this view, he pointed to Colossians 2:9, which states that in Jesus dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Ewart explained his discovery to other Pentecostal ministers, some of whom rejected his teaching, but others enthusiastically embraced it.\n\nOn April 15, 1914, Ewart re-baptized Glenn A. Cook, his assistant and a veteran evangelist of the Azusa Street Mission, in the name of Jesus Christ, and Cook re-baptized Ewart. This would set in motion an issue that would divide the Pentecostal movement between the Trinitarians and the Jesus Name only, or \"Oneness\" believers. Afterward, they began re-baptizing thousands of Pentecostals with the shorter formula \u201cin the name of Jesus\u201d, claiming those baptisms performed with the citation of Matthew 28:19 were invalid, and that baptism must be performed \u201cin the name of Jesus\u201d (only). Additionally, those who had been baptized in the threefold titles of \u201cFather, Son and Holy Spirit\u201d, must renounce that baptism and be re-baptized with \"the Name of Jesus\" pronounced over them, before they can be regarded as biblically baptized.\n\nConsequently, in 1914, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World experienced its first split. Those leaders and individuals who embraced the Trinitarian concept (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) pulled out from the Association. Many of the whites who left the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World at this time would eventually form the Assemblies of God organization. During this transition period (about one year), they received their ministerial credentials from the Church of God in Christ organization.\n\nIn 1915, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World was reorganized in Indianapolis, Indiana, at Christ Temple Assembly of the Apostolic Faith, where Bishop G. T. Haywood was the pastor. At that meeting, Bishop Haywood was appointed as the organization's first General Overseer and their headquarters were moved from Los Angeles, California to Portland, Oregon.\n\nAmong those who accepted the Oneness doctrine and played a tremendous role in the early days of the Pentecostal movement was Garfield Thomas Haywood, an African American minister, who was pastor of a very successful Pentecostal Church called \"\"Christ Temple Apostolic Faith Assembly\"\" in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1915, the racial make up of the congregation was about 50% African American and 50% white. It instantly became one of the largest Pentecostal congregations in the world when Bishop Haywood was re-baptized in the Name of Jesus, and together, the two men re-baptized the entire congregation of 465 members.\n\nIn 1918, J.J. Frazee chaired a business meeting in St. Louis that produced a merger between the P.A.W. and the General Assembly of Apostolic Assemblies (founded January 2, 1917 GAAA). The newly merged-group retained the name Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. Later that year, E. W. Doak became Chairman and W. E. Booth-Clibborn, grandson of the Booths who founded the Salvation Army in London, became Secretary. This interracial organization was the only Oneness Pentecostal organization until late 1924, when a separation occurred, mainly along racial lines, by the splitting off of most of the whites into the Pentecostal Church, Inc.\n\nOn January 25, 1919, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World was formally incorporated in the state of Indiana and the headquarters were moved from Portland, Oregon to Indianapolis, Indiana. The incorporators were E. W. Doak, G. T. Haywood, and D. C. O. Opperman.\n\nIn 1925, the organization established a Board of Bishops consisting of five members. One of these five members, G. T. Haywood, was then elected as the \"Presiding Bishop\".\n\nIn 1932, the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World was reorganized. They elevated Elder Samuel Grimes of New York to the office of Bishop, and elected him as the new Presiding Bishop. Bishop Grimes was born in Barbados, British West Indies. He was saved under the ministry of Elder W. W. Rue. He was also greatly influenced by Bishop G. T. Haywood. Bishop Grimes served as a missionary to Liberia, West Africa, along with his wife. He also founded and established the Eastern District Conferences, which consists of 13 Conferences (Councils). He also became the second editor of \"The Christian Outlook\", which is the official magazine of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. He served in the office Presiding Bishop for 35 years (1932\u20131967) which is longer than any other individual to date. It was during the time that he served in that capacity that the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World's also established procedures regarding the filling of pastoral vacancies.\n\nIn 1945, the Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ and the Pentecostal Churches, Inc. merged and formed the United Pentecostal Church. This Oneness group is the largest numerically of all the Oneness groups. Historically, it has been predominantly white. Racial issues are one of the main causes of their split from the PAW. The two organizations have since embraced each other condemning discrimination and hatred on the basis of race.\n\nWhile William Joseph Seymour is considered the initial founder, D.C.O.(Daniel Charles Owen) Opperman, E. W. Doak, and Garfield Thomas Haywood were the initial incorporators. J. J. Frazee was elected the first head and was titled \"General Overseer\".\n\nThe head of the organization held the title of \"General Elder\" or \"General Overseer\" until 1925, when it was changed to Presiding Bishop. At the same time they established an executive board consisting of five members (Bishops). G. T. Haywood, one of the five members, was elected as the first \"Presiding Bishop\". This is in slight contrast to the current Board of Bishops which now consists of 12 formal members, and also includes Lay-Directors from various regions of the United States, and Emeritus Bishops who once served, but are either semi or fully retired.\n\nWhile the original intent for replacing \"Overseer\" with the word \"Bishop\" for this role may not have been to signify an additional tier of leadership \"above\" that of a Pastor, this tradition has become sanctioned organizational doctrine. In essence it has served to redefine the meaning of the word, by making it distinct from Shepherd/Pastor/Overseer, which is contrary to New Testament doctrine where bishop is used as a synonymous term. Conversely, there are no formally acknowledged Apostles and only rarely is the title Prophet used by those in the ministerial ranks in this day, and both titles are absent from the current leadership structure. The caveat is that Apostles are acknowledged in their original role of establishment of the church and the commitment of the body to follow their epistles governing our Christian conduct. Additionally, since the change in 1925, other levels/titles have subsequently been added/amended to the organizational structure which include: District Elder and Suffragan Bishop continuing the adoption of a more Episcopalian Polity approach.\n\nThe following is a listing of the Bishops which have served as head of the organization since 1925 and includes their race (countering those who have attempted to state that the PAW has continued to be a \"black-only\" organization since the split that occurred in late 1924):\n\nWomen in leadership roles has been a point of contention within Christian groups since prior to the organizing of the P.A.W.. The organizations evolving stance moving toward total inclusion of women in the bishoprick led many assemblies to part ways by leaving the organization and in some cases prior assemblies or organizations responding by limiting or ceasing fellowship with P.A.W. member assemblies altogether.\n\nThe organization currently has women in every leadership position (i.e. Pastor, District Elder, Suffragan Bishop, and Diocesan Bishop) with the only exception being that of the office of Presiding Bishop. Aletha J. Cushinberry was the first woman who was elevated to Honorary Bishop in 2015. Then in 2017 the organization elevated two women to diocesan bishop.\n\nOrganizational structure is currently divided into Episcopal Districts (by state or country), commonly called councils or diocese. Each of these are headed by a Diocesan Bishop, who is appointed by the Bishop's Board. A Diocesan Bishop can have as many as three assistants, called Suffragan Bishops. These Suffragan Bishops hold only the authority given them by the Diocesan Bishop. Typically they will have authority over a region or part of a state. Reporting under the Suffragan Bishop is the office of District Elder, who oversees and assists the Elders (Pastors and their churches) in his district.\n\nThe following table contains the listing of Current Episcopal Districts/Dioceses for the organization.\n\nCurrent Emeritus / Honorary Bishops with Race and gender indicated (if female).\n\nThe organization also has structural segments whose general purpose is to ensure specific focus and attention is given to key areas of service to the body. These are called Departments and Auxiliaries with leadership elected by the organization membership some of which also have individual directors appointed by the board of bishops as their representatives to the organization's executive board. (A similar structure exists within each diocese for that particular state/region.) \n\n\n\n\n"

Also known as Dr. Dirty, he typically performs in a white tailcoat suit and black derby hat. His songs and shows focus mainly on sex and racial slurs, with a mix of current and historic people and events.\n\nValby was born and raised in upstate New York. He attended school in Rochester, New York, where at age seven, was taught to play the piano by two nuns. At ten, Valby wanted to become a performer. In 1966, Valby graduated from Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont. He attended Duke University, and graduated with a degree in idealism. At one point he considered a profession as a philosophy teacher, but soon realized it was not right for him and focused on musical entertainment.\n\nValby joined various rock bands in his early career that \"kept on breaking up\", which drove him to become a solo piano act of mostly rock and roll and honky tonk tunes. At one show in May 1974, he added some dirty songs of his own into the set. The positive response to the dirty songs led Valby to focus on the more adult material. He would often write new material while transporting between gigs. Valby claimed that he was named \"Dr. Dirty\" by the National Entertainment Conference, a booking organisation for the college circuit. He stated that he disliked the name because it \"takes away from the element of surprise\". He credited some of his obscene act as a reaction to the Catholic repression that he faced during childhood.\n\nIn addition to his blue comedy act, Valby has recorded and produced pop and rock albums for himself and other artists, including Buffalo Sabres defenseman Jim Schoenfeld, with whom Valby recorded two albums, \"Schony\" (1972) and \"The Key is Love\" (1974). He also had a small role as a piano player in a Tijuana brothel in the 1983 film \"Losin' It\" which featured an early performance by Tom Cruise.\n\nValby is married to his wife Ann; together they have six children. In August 2012 he lived in a house in Clarence, New York; that was burned due to suspected arson. As of 2016, he still lived in Clarence.\n\nValby endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election and recorded a song and music video supporting his campaign.

Among the criteria requested was that it had to be a single-seater powered by a Rollason Ardem flat-four engine, design limits were \u00b16g, maximum wing area of 65 sq ft and a maximum weight of 750lbs. As a result of Taylor designed a high performance single-seater, the Titch based on his earlier Taylor Monoplane. \n\nAt the closing date of the competition 42 designs had been submitted which was won by a project named Beta but the Titch was placed second.\n\nTaylor built the prototype, registered G-ATYO, at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex between 1965 and 1966. The Titch first flew at Southend Airport on 4 January 1967.\n\nThe designer John Taylor was killed when the prototype Titch crashed at Southend on 16 May 1967. The marketing of plans for both his aircraft designs were taken on by his wife and later his son.\n\n, 40 examples had been completed and flown.\n\nThe Titch is a single-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane of all wood construction similar to the Monoplane but has fewer metal fittings than the earlier design and full size wing rib plans are supplied for the tapered wing panels. With a cruise speed in the region of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), it is an effective cross-country touring aircraft and is also fully aerobatic. Builders can fit it with either a Continental or a Lycoming engine.\n\n"

    "title": "Science Park High School (New Jersey)",
    "text": "Science Park High School, formerly known as Science High School, is a magnet public high school located in the University Heights section of Newark in Essex County, New Jersey, United States. The school opened in 1974 and serves students in ninth through twelfth grades as part of the Newark Public Schools. The school is for college-bound students, offering many Advanced Placement equally rigorous honors courses and as of the 2013-14 school year, IB classes to those who choose to apply.\n\nAs of the 2017-18 school year, the school had an enrollment of 811 students and 61.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student\u2013teacher ratio of 13.3:1. There were 518 students (63.9% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 96 (11.8% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch. The student population is 40% black, 30% Hispanic, 28% white and 2% Asian/Pacific Islander.\n\nThe mission of Science Park High School is to transform mathematics and science teaching and learning by developing ethical leaders who know the joy of discovery and forging connections within and among mathematics, science, the humanities and the arts by means of exemplary laboratory environments characterized by research, innovative teaching, and service.\n\nSPHS operates on nine 42-minute period schedule, similar to Technology High School, as opposed to \"block\" scheduling that is utilized in other schools in the Newark Public Schools district, where students take their classes in four longer \"blocks.\" Unlike other high schools in the city, SPHS students take two science courses specific to their academic year. SPHS students are generally expected to take Advanced Placement courses in the latter half of their four years at the school, with many students taking Advanced Placement American Literature their Senior year while many Juniors enroll in an Advanced Placement English III course.\n\nSPHS offers math courses ranging from Geometry (offered to qualified in-coming Freshmen) to AP Calculus, Science courses are offered ranging from a Freshman year Earth, Space, and Life Sciences course to a Sophomore year Physics course to AP Biology and AP Physics.\n\nFor 32 years, Science High School was at 40 Rector Street in Newark, in a building that was originally the Ballantine Brewery. After the brewery closed, it was acquired by Rutgers\u2013Newark and was converted into a facility for chemistry research and training. In the 1970s, the Newark Public Schools leased the structure and converted it for use as a high school until 2006. The building was subsequently demolished in 2016 and the property is now part of One Riverview, a residential complex. It is also known as 50 Rector Park, a 22 story luxury residential apartment building developed by Boraie Development. It is scheduled for completion in March 2019. The class of 2010\u20132011 was the first to graduate from the new Science Park High School having spent four full school years in the new building located at 260 Norfolk Street.\n\nThe new building has a capacity of 926 students and is located on a campus. The school was renamed Science Park High School because of its location near and connections with the University Heights Science Park. It is a collaborative venture between Newark's higher education institutions, the City of Newark, and private industry.\n\nThe building includes a state of the art solar and geothermal energy system and highly efficient heating and cooling. The new facility includes grades 7-12. At the completion of grade 8, students may apply for entrance into the high school in the same manner as other students from Newark elementary schools.\n\nThe school was the 72nd-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in \"New Jersey Monthly\" magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 116th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 69th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 50th in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 53rd in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which included 316 schools across the state.\n\nDuring the 2009-10 school year, Science Park High School was awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education, the highest award an American school can receive.\n\nSchooldigger.com ranked the school 17th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (an increase of 5 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (98.8%) and language arts literacy (100.0%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).\n\nIn its 2013 report on \"America's Best High Schools\", \"The Daily Beast\" ranked the school 687th in the nation among participating public high schools and 53rd among schools in New Jersey.\n\nIn the 2016 report on \"Best High Schools National Rankings\", \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranked the school 20th statewide from 422 schools and 375th from the top 6,517 public high schools nationwide and earning the Gold Medal in college readiness.\n\nScience Park High School Chargers compete in the Super Essex Conference, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). With 554 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2015-16 school year as North II, Group II for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 508 to 770 students in that grade range. The school competed in the Colonial Hills Conference prior to the NJSIAA's reorganization.\n\nSports:\n\n\nThe girls track team won the Group I indoor relay state championship in 1988 and 1997; the boys team won the Group I state title in 1994.\n\nThe boys' basketball team won the Group I state title in 1995 vs Burlington City High School, in 2005 vs. Arthur P. Schalick High School and in 2008 vs. Salem High School, and won the Group II state championship in 2009 vs. Camden High School. The boys' basketball team won the 2008 North II, Group I state sectional title with a 51-40 win over Bloomfield Tech High School in the tournament final.\n\nThe Science High School Debate Teams was established in 1979 by Brent Farrand and quickly became the model for urban debate programs nationally. By the early eighties, the Science HS Debate programs had nationally competitive teams. By the mid-eighties, the Science HS program boasted nationally ranked teams. The main difference between the Newark Science HS debate program and other nationally competitive programs was the make-up of the debate team. This was a team of students from all walks of life, economic backgrounds and ethnicity. The Newark Science HS Debate program seeded the idea that debate teams from the inner city could not only participate in debate, but they could dominate. Science High School debaters have been nationally ranked and routinely compete at the highest levels of high school debate.\n\nMr. Farrand served as the debate coach and Algebra teacher for over 20 years at Science High. Jonathan Alston and Randy Mitchell currently coach the debate program at Science, maintaining its national prominence.\n\nThe school's principal is Angela Mincy.\n\n"

    "text": "Thomas Alan Grieve (born March 4, 1948) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball from 1970 to 1979 for the Washington Senators, Texas Rangers, New York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals. He was Nicknamed \"TAG\", which are his initials. \n\nGrieve was drafted by the Washington Senators in the 1st round (6th pick) of the 1966 MLB June Amateur Draft from Pittsfield High School. Before signing with Washington in the summer of 1966, Grieve played in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) with the Chatham Red Sox. He hit .416 in 25 games, and in 2010 was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.\n\nGrieve's best season was 1976 with the Rangers when he hit .255, belted 20 home runs and had 81 runs batted in.\n\nGrieve was dealt from the Rangers to the Mets in the first four-team blockbuster deal in Major League Baseball history on December 8, 1977 that also involved the Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates and a total of eleven players changing teams. The Mets got from the Braves Willie Monta\u00f1ez and also from the Rangers Ken Henderson who was sent to New York to complete the transaction three months later on March 15, 1978. The Rangers received Al Oliver and Nelson Norman from the Pirates and Jon Matlack from the Mets. Adrian Devine, Tommy Boggs and Eddie Miller were traded from the Rangers to the Braves. The Pirates acquired Bert Blyleven from the Rangers and John Milner from the Mets.\n\nPrimarily an outfielder and a designated hitter, the right-handed batter finished his career with a .249 average, 65 homers and 254 RBIs in 670 games.\n\nIn between, Grieve posted five solid seasons in the Venezuelan Winter League while playing for the \u00c1guilas del Zulia, Leones del Caracas and Tiburones de La Guaira clubs between 1971 and 1979.\n\nAccording to his own words, he says that any player who skips winter ball does themselves a disservice because they\u2019re too lazy.\n\nAfter retiring as a player at the end of the 1979 season, Grieve joined the Rangers' front office, and did his first work as a color commentator for Rangers television broadcasts during the 1980 season. In 1984 Grieve became general manager of the Rangers, and served in that capacity until 1994. In December 1988 Grieve made one of the best trades in team history, acquiring Rafael Palmeiro and Jamie Moyer from the Chicago Cubs for Mitch Williams. That same winter he acquired future batting champion Julio Franco. However, he also traded away several future stars, including Sammy Sosa in 1989 and Robb Nen in 1993.\nSince 1995, Grieve has served as the color commentator for the Texas Rangers, which is the longest tenure of any TV broadcaster in Texas Rangers club history. Since 2017, he has split duties with C.J. Nitkowski.\n\nThe Grieves were the first father-and-son combo to be selected in the first round of the MLB draft. Tom was chosen sixth overall by the Senators in 1966 while Ben was the second overall selection by Oakland in 1994. Ben Grieve played 976 games for the Oakland A's, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago Cubs.\n\nTom Grieve was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame in a ceremony held on July 24, 2010.\n\n"

    "title": "Stuart Cable",
    "text": "Stuart Cable (19 May 1970 \u2013 7 June 2010) was a Welsh rock drummer and broadcaster, best known as the original drummer for the band Stereophonics.\n\nCable was born in Aberdare on 19 May 1970. When he was 10, his father died. Thereafter, Cable and his elder brother, Paul, were raised by their mother Mabel (born 1930) on her own. Cable grew up in the close-knit village of Cwmaman near Aberdare, He attended Blaengwawr Comprehensive School with his friend, Stereophonics singer-songwriter and guitarist Kelly Jones, who also lived on the same street.\n\nTogether with Kelly Jones' school friend Richard Jones, the trio began playing covers in working men's clubs from 1992, under the title \"Tragic Love Company.\" The band later changed their name to Stereophonics in 1996. He also played a number of notable gigs in his native Wales. Of particular note were the concert of 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle and the concert of 31 July 1999 at the Morfa Stadium in Swansea, the latter shortly before the stadium was demolished. Both concerts were filmed live and released on VHS and DVD.\n\nCable also played for other bands, including as a vocalist for Rhondda band NailBombs. During 1992, they recorded the E.P. \"Raw Sex for Breakfast\" at Sound Space Studios in Cardiff, on which Cable sang lead vocals. After Cable fully committed to Stereophonics, he was replaced by ex-Rag Dolls frontman J.J.Cruz.\n\nHe had been the temporary drummer for hard rock band Stone Gods, which was formed by former members of The Darkness, filling in for Ed Graham during 2008 who had left the band for health reasons.\n\nMost recently, Cable had been drumming in his new Welsh band, Killing for Company, who were the first band to play the new Liberty Stadium in Swansea, supporting The Who.\n\nIn 2002, Cable was given his own TV chat show, \"Cable TV\", by BBC Wales. He was sacked by the rest of the band in September 2003, because it was claimed he was spending too much time on his new media career at the expense of rehearsals. After that, he had another television series of his own, \"Cable Connects\" (2005) and had his own radio show on BBC Radio Wales: \"Cable Rock\".\n\nCable was the spokesperson of a 2002 BBC Wales campaign (called BLLCKS) to raise awareness of testicular cancer.\n\nIn 2005, Cable co-hosted the \"Kerrang!\" Awards, and he also presented two shows on Kerrang! 105.2: the 'Cable and Caroline Show' with Caroline Beavon on Sunday mornings and \"The Rock 'n' Roll Years\" on weekday mornings until 2010. In November 2007, he joined XFM South Wales and hosted weekend shows until the station was sold on 30 May 2008. After leaving Kerrang! Radio, in April 2010 Cable returned to BBC Radio Wales as the presenter of Saturday Night Cable, a show playing both old and new rock music. Cable interviewed Slash from Guns N' Roses as a presenter and was scheduled to interview his favourite band, AC/DC, on the weekend following his death, at the Download Festival (where his new band were also scheduled to play).\n\nCable owned a flat in Cardiff Bay, and partly lived in Abernant, before moving to the neighbouring village of Llwydcoed in a Tudor-style house. In 1999, he married Nicola in Bridgend. Their son, Cian Damen, was born in 2001 in Cardiff. In 2003, he had an affair with Welsh TV presenter Lisa Rogers. Cable claims that it was differences between Rogers and Kelly Jones' partner Becka (Rebecca Walters) at the time which violently came to a head publicly at a restaurant in Paris, eventually leading to his dismissal after he made a sarcastic joke about the incident the following day. Around 2003, Cable and his wife divorced. In April 2009 he had spoken out about being sacked from Stereophonics and describes the moment they played in front of 80,000 people in Cardiff without him as \"the darkest time of my entire life\". He had said, \"Until that point in my life, I had never ever considered something as stupid as suicide, but that night I could really understand why people get depressed enough to do it.\" He patched up his differences with Kelly Jones in 2009 and at the time of his death they were in contact again.\n\nCable released his autobiography in April 2009, entitled \"Demons and Cocktails \u2013 My Life with the Stereophonics.\" In his autobiography, he stated that he had been a hard drinker and drug user, particularly whisky and cocaine. He claimed his close friend, Dirty Sanchez star Matthew Pritchard, enjoyed wild parties and drugs. Like former Stereophonics bandmate Richard Jones, he was also a motorcycle enthusiast. According to a neighbour, he was planning a motorcycle tour of Spain.\n\nCable was outspoken about child safety and backed a campaign named 'Stuart's Campaign', established following the death of Cowbridge schoolboy Stuart Cunningham-Jones, who died aboard a school bus. He had said, \"In this day and age every child should have the right to travel to and from school in absolute safety.\"\n\nCable was found dead at his home in Llwydcoed at 5:30\u00a0am on 7 June 2010, aged 40. On the evening of 5 June, Stereophonics played in Cardiff; Cable was said to have been presenting on the radio at the same time that Stereophonics were performing. The following day, he began drinking at Welsh Harp Inn in Trecynon. Cable walked home with friends, where he continued drinking and choked to death on his own vomit during his sleep. Cable is survived by one child, his brother and mother.\n\nCable's funeral was held at St. Elvan's Church in Aberdare on 21 June 2010. The cortege was attended by black horse-driven cabriolet. He was later cremated.\n\n"

    "title": "Ballot Security Task Force",
    "text": "The National Ballot Security Task Force (BSTF) was a controversial group founded in 1981 in New Jersey by the Republican National Committee (RNC) as a means of intimidating voters and discouraging voter turnout among likely Democratic voters in the gubernatorial election. The group's activities prompted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to bring a federal lawsuit, alleging a violation of the Voting Rights Act, illegal harassment, and voter intimidation. The RNC and New Jersey Republican State Committee entered into a consent decree in 1982, barring them from engaging in further such conduct until 2017. The RNC unsuccessfully tried to lift the consent decree early; these attempts were rejected by the federal courts each time. The consent decree was set to expire on December 1, 2017. Democrats sought an extension to it based on allegations of new conduct, but the request was denied in January 2018 and the decree expired.\n\nThe task force consisted of a group of armed, off-duty police officers wearing armbands, who were hired to patrol polling sites in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods of Newark and Trenton.\n\nInitially, 45,000 letters were mailed (using an outdated voter registration list) to primarily Latino and African-American citizens. Many of these letters were later returned as non-deliverable, and the 45,000 addresses were used to create a list of voters. These voters were then challenged by the BSTF, a practice known as voter caging.\n\nIn addition, the Republican National Committee filed a request for election supervisors to strike these voters from the rolls, but the commissioners of registration refused when they discovered that the RNC had used outdated information.\n\nOn New Jersey's election day in 1981, the BSTF posted large signs, without identification but with an official appearance, reading \nArmed members of the Task Force \"were drawn from the ranks of off-duty county deputy sheriffs and local police,\" who \"prominently displayed revolvers, two-way radios, and BSTF armbands.\" BSTF patrols \"challenged and questioned voters at the polls and blocked the way of some prospective voters\" in predominantly African-American and Hispanic areas. Democrat James J. Florio lost the gubernatorial election to Republican Thomas H. Kean by 1,797 votes.\n\nA civil lawsuit was filed after the election by the DNC, which alleged that the RNC had violated the Voting Rights Act and engaged in illegal harassment and voter intimidation. The suit was settled in 1982, when the Republican National Committee and New Jersey Republican State Committee, instead of a trial, signed a consent decree in U.S. District Court saying that they would not allow tactics that could intimidate Democratic voters, though they did not admit any wrongdoing. \n\nThe consent decree, entered on November 1, 1982, prevents the Republican Party \"from engaging in activities that suppress the vote, particularly when it comes to minority voters.\" It also bars the wearing of armbands at polling places. Under the consent decree \"the Republican party organizations agreed to allow a federal court to review proposed 'ballot security' programs, including any proposed voter caging.\" The consent decree is set to expire in December 2017. A successor consent decree, applying to several states, was entered on July 27, 1987.\n\nThe Republican Party has attempted several times, unsuccessfully, to terminate the consent decree, arguing that it is \"antiquated\" and unnecessary. The Democratic National Committee had countered by arguing that \"recent campaigns show the 'consent degree remains necessary today.'\" In 2009, a New Jersey federal judge rejected the RNC's request to vacate the consent decree, and this ruling was unanimously affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 2012. The Supreme Court declined to hear the RNC's appeal in 2013.\n\nOn October 26, 2016, the DNC filed a motion asking the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey to find that the RNC had violated the consent decree. The motion was filed after the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested, without evidence, that the election was \"rigged\" in favor of his opponent Hillary Clinton and urged Trump supporters to watch the polls to combat supposed \"voter fraud.\" The DNC also sought to extend the duration of the consent decree. A shortened discovery occurred, and on November 5 the court denied the request. The court determined that the DNC did not present \"sufficient evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the RNC on ballot-security operations\" but did \"allow the DNC to offer further evidence after the election.\"\n\nThe consent decree restricting Republican Party conduct was set to expire on December 1, 2017, but Democrats sought an extension, alleging that statements from Donald Trump campaign officials showed the RNC had engaged in activities in violation of the decree. U.S. District Judge John Michael Vazquez allowed the Democratic Party to take the deposition of Sean Spicer before issuing a decision on whether the decree should be allowed to expire, but denied Democrats' motions for hearings on the issue. On January 8, Judge John Vasquez ruled that the decree had expired on December 1, and would not be extended.\n\n"

    "title": "The Hobbit (1982 video game)",
    "text": "The Hobbit is an illustrated text adventure computer game released in 1982 for the ZX Spectrum home computer and based on the book \"The Hobbit\", by J. R. R. Tolkien. It was developed at Beam Software by Philip Mitchell and Veronika Megler and published by Melbourne House. It was later converted to most home computers available at the time including the Commodore 64, BBC Micro and Oric computers. By arrangement with the book publishers, a copy of the book was included with each game sold.\n\nThe parser was very advanced for the time and used a subset of English called \"Inglish\". When it was released, most adventure games used simple verb-noun parsers (allowing for simple phrases like \"get lamp\"), but Inglish allowed the player to type advanced sentences such as \"ask Gandalf about the curious map then take sword and kill troll with it\". The parser was complex and intuitive, introducing pronouns, adverbs (\"viciously attack the goblin\"), punctuation and prepositions and allowing the player to interact with the game world in ways not previously possible.\n\nMany locations are illustrated by an image, based on originals designed by Kent Rees. On the tape version, to save space, each image was stored in a compressed format by storing outline information and then flood filling the enclosed areas on the screen. The slow CPU speed meant that it would take up to several seconds for each scene to draw. The disk-based versions of the game used pre-rendered, higher-quality images.\n\nThe game has an innovative text-based physics system, developed by Veronika Megler. Objects, including the characters in the game, have a calculated size, weight, and solidity. Objects can be placed inside other objects, attached together with rope and damaged or broken. If the main character is sitting in a barrel and this barrel is then picked up and thrown through a trapdoor, the player would go through.\n\nUnlike other works of interactive fiction, the game is also in real time, insofar as a period of idleness causes the \"WAIT\" command to be automatically invoked and the possibility of events occurring as a result. This can be suppressed by entering the \"PAUSE\" command, which stops all events until a key is pressed.\n\nThe game has a cast of non-player characters (NPCs) entirely independent of the player and bound to precisely the same game rules. They have loyalties, strengths, and personalities that affect their behaviour and cannot always be predicted. The character of Gandalf, for example, would roam freely around the game world (some fifty locations), picking up objects, getting into fights and being captured.\n\nThe volatility of the characters, coupled with the rich physics and impossible-to-predict fighting system, enabled the game to be played in many different ways, though this would also lead to problems (such as an important character being killed early on). There are numerous possible solutions and with hindsight, the game might be regarded as one of the first examples of emergent gameplay. This also resulted, however, in many bugs; for example, during development Megler found that the animal NPCs killed each other before the player arrived. The game's documentation warned that \"Due to the immense size and complexity of this game it is impossible to guarantee that it will ever be completely error-free\". Melbourne House issued a version 1.1 with some fixes, but with another bug that resulted in the game being unwinnable, forcing it to release version 1.2, and the company never fixed all bugs.\n\n\"Info\" in 1985 rated \"The Hobbit\" on the Commodore 64 three-plus stars out of five, stating that the graphics were \"pleasant but no show-stoppers\", and that the game's parser and puzzles were \"typical of most adventures today\". The magazine concluded that \"Tolkien fans will most likely be pleased with this title\".\n\n\"The Hobbit\" was a bestseller in the UK on the ZX Spectrum in 1983 and both the C64 and BBC the following year. The game won the 1983 Golden Joystick Award for best strategy game. The game was also a huge commercial success, selling over 100,000 copies in its first two years at a retail price of \u00a314.95. There are no records of sales figures but in an article from March 1985 it was estimated in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 and a figure of 500,000 copies is possible, making it an \"excellent candidate for the bestselling text adventure of all time, challenged, if at all, only by Infocom\u2019s \"Zork I\"\". The use of images on many of the locations as opposed to mostly text-only adventure games of the time, the flexibility of the \"Inglish\" parser, the innovative independence of the non-player characters, the popularity of Tolkien's work, all attributed to the game's phenomenal success.\n\n\"Macworld\" reviewed the Macintosh versions of \"The Hobbit\", \"\" and \"The Shadows of Mordor\" simultaneously, criticizing \"The Hobbit\", calling it \"particularly clumsy\" as it is \"handicapped by a 400-word input vocabulary\" as opposed to the latter two games' 800 words. \"Macworld\" calls \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" \"particularly intricate\" and recommends it as an entry point to the series as opposed to \"The Hobbit\". \"Macworld\" praises \"The Hobbit's\" graphics, but states that in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" and \"The Shadows of Mordor\" \"the art adds little to the games' overall appeal.\" Futhermore, \"Macworld\" heralds the three games as \"literate and faithful in spirit to original books\", but criticizes the dated and \"rigid\" nature of the text-adventure format.\n\nTo help players a book called \"A guide to playing The Hobbit\" by David Elkan was published in 1984.\n\nDeveloper Beam Software followed up \"The Hobbit\" with 1985's \"\", 1987's \"Shadows of Mordor: Game Two of Lord of the Rings\", and 1989's \"The Crack of Doom\". They would also reuse Inglish in \"Sherlock\".\n\nIn 1986 a parody of the game was released by CRL, \"The Boggit\".\n\nA phrase from the game which has entered popular culture is \"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.\"\n\nAlso, the game is mentioned in Nick Montfort's, \"Twisty Little Passages\", a book exploring the history and form of the interactive fiction genre.\n\n\"Discworld Noir\" references \"The Hobbit\": when the protagonist, Lewton, discovers that someone concealed themselves in a wine barrel, he wonders why that brings to mind the phrases \"You wait \u2013 time passes\" and \"Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.\"\n\n"

    "text": "Weigela is a genus of between six and 38 species of deciduous shrubs in the family Caprifoliaceae, growing to 1\u20135 m (3-15') tall. All are natives of eastern Asia. The genus is named after the German scientist Christian Ehrenfried Weigel.\n\nThe leaves are 5\u201315\u00a0cm long, ovate-oblong with an acuminate tip, and with a serrated margin.\n\nThe flowers are 2\u20134\u00a0cm long, with a five-lobed white, pink, or red (rarely yellow) corolla, produced in small corymbs of several together in early summer.\n\nThe fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small winged seeds.\n\nSeveral fossil seeds and fruit fragments of \u2020\"Weigela srodoniowae\" have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.\n\nThe first species to be collected for Western gardens, \"Weigela florida\", distributed in North China, Korea and Manchuria, was found by Robert Fortune and imported to England in 1845. Following the opening of Japan to Westerners, several \"Weigela\" species and garden versions were \"discovered\" by European plant-hunters in the 1850s and 1860s, though they were already well known to locals.\n\nThe British \"Weigela\" national collection is held at Sheffield Botanical Gardens; along with the national collection of the closely related genus \"Diervilla\". The German \"Weigela\" national collection, Sichtungsgarten Weigela, is in Buckow, Maerkische-Schweiz.\n\n\"Weigela\" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail.\n\n\nSeveral of the species are very popular ornamental shrubs in gardens, although species have been mostly superseded by hybrids (crosses between \"W. florida\" and other Asiatic species). The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n\n\"Weigela florida\" <nowiki>'Pink Princess'</nowiki> is a popular cultivar of \"Weigela florida\", a shrub native to northern China, Korea, and Japan, that flowers profusely. It is a hardy plant, easy to grow and maintain. It grows to a height and width of up to in appropriate conditions, and is thus more compact than the normal \"Weigela florida\", which makes it a more versatile shrub. It is attractive to hummingbirds and bees.\n\n"

    "title": "\u0160koda Octavia",
    "text": "The \u0160koda Octavia is a small family car produced by the Czech manufacturer \u0160koda Auto since 1996. It shares its name with an earlier model produced between 1959 and 1971. Three generations of the modern-era Octavia model have been introduced to date, delivered with five-door liftback saloon or five-door estate styles only. The car is front engined, both front- or four-wheel drive are offered. Around five million units have been sold in its two decades of presence on the market. The Octavia is \u0160koda's most popular model; about 40% of all newly manufactured \u0160koda cars are Octavias.\n\nThe current generation is available in wide range of derivatives, i.e. sports Octavia RS, four-wheel drive Octavia Combi, frugal Octavia GreenLine, CNG-powered Octavia G-TEC, and outdoor Octavia Scout.\n\nThe first generation Octavia was released in November 1996 and was built at the modernised \u0160koda factory in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, Czech Republic. This generation was made available in sedan or estate styles only.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, sales began in 1998 and the mid-size car was a success, nearing the success of established large family car favourites such as the Ford Mondeo and Vauxhall Vectra.\n\nThe first generation Octavia had a facelift in 2000, and was still manufactured and marketed in some markets, even after the second generation was introduced in 2004. In Germany, and other parts of West Europe, as well as Asia, the first generation model was marketed as the Octavia Tour, while the newer model is marketed as the Octavia. In some markets, the first generation Octavia was still known as Octavia, and the newer model was referred to as the new Octavia, Octavia5 (Greece) or Laura (India).\n\nIn India, Octavia was launched in 2002 and was an instant hit with Indians for its frugal engines and solid build. It became a huge success in India, selling 44,900 units.\n\nRevisions to the facelifted model included independent rear suspension and revised interior.\n\nThe facelifted Octavia featured a 4x4 wheel drive version both for the estate and more popular sedan models, and used the Haldex Traction clutch, like other Volkswagen Group A platform based cars (Golf IV, Audi A3 and Seat Leon Cupra R4). It had higher ground clearance and a bigger fuel tank carrying compared to the standard front wheel drive versions.\n\nThe 4x4 option was only available with the 1.8 T petrol engine, the 1.9 TDI diesel engine, or the 2.0 L petrol engine, all coupled with a 5-speed manual gearbox, and with the 1.9 TDI-PD (Pumpe-D\u00fcse) diesel engine which came with a 6-speed manual gearbox.\n\nThe other 6-speed manual model was the 1.9 TDI-PD , only available with front-wheel-drive.\n\nThe vRS was the top-level and quickest specification and used a 1.8-litre straight-4 turbocharged engine which produced . \u0160koda made a limited number of 100 WRC Replica Cars worldwide in 2002. These differ from normal vRS Octavias, as they are produced in white, have rally decals and have additional accessories as standard (such as ESP, xenon lights, heated front seats).\n\nThe engines used are the same as for many other cars in the Volkswagen Group:\n\nThe \u0160koda Octavia has been used in the European Touring Car Championship, the World Rally Championship and the FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup.\n\nThe second-generation Octavia was introduced in March 2004, based on the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform also used by other Volkswagen Group cars, such as the Audi A3 Mk2, Volkswagen Golf Mk5, Volkswagen Jetta Mk5, SEAT Le\u00f3n Mk2, etc.\n\nResponsible for the design were Thomas Ingenlath and Peter Wouda. Along with a new internal-combustion engine range, also shared with other models of the Volkswagen Group, body changes included more legroom for rear-seat passengers (a weak point in the original model) and increased ground clearance at front and rear to reduce the risk of grounding on steep ramps or facing kerbs.\n\nIn addition to the Czech factories in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav and Vrchlabi, from 2008, the Octavia has also been produced at a factory in Bratislava, Slovakia, and in Shanghai, China, under the joint venture of Shanghai Volkswagen. In Russia, the Octavia is assembled at the Volkswagen plant in Kaluga.\n\nIn India, the second-generation Octavia was marketed as the Laura to distinguish it from the first generation. The car was marketed in a higher-income segment, and was sold alongside the previous-generation Octavia. However, the first generation ended production in India in 2010, and as of 2012, the Laura's price was reduced and was competing in its predecessor's segment.\n\nTwo four-wheel drive versions of the Octavia are made: the 4x4 and the Scout, both featuring a Haldex Traction four-wheel drive system, based on a computer-controlled clutch centre coupling. The two models both have higher ground clearance than the standard Octavia, increased by for the 4x4 and by for the Scout.\n\nThe Scout, announced in 2006, is only available with the estate body style, and has several crossover-style exterior modifications, such as larger bumpers.\n\nIn August 2011, a special \u0160koda Octavia vRS hit the world record on the American Bonneville Speedway and became the fastest car in the world with an up to two-litre engine, when it hit .\n\nSeveral engine options are available. All engines are inline-four cylinder designs, water-cooled and use multipoint fuel injection. All diesel engines are turbocharged direct injection (TDI) engines.\nNotes:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Octavia is available in these trim levels: Classic (now called S), Ambiente (now called SE), 4x4 (estate only), Elegance, Laurin & Klement, Scout 4x4 (estate only), and vRS. All models come with four airbags, electric front windows, air conditioning, central locking and antilock braking system. In some markets, including British and Czech, a version aimed to lower fuel consumption called Greenline is also available. As of September 2011, trim levels have been renamed to Active (Classic) and Ambition (Ambiente).\n\nA facelifted version was launched in 2009, after being formally unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor Show.\n\nThe modifications of the facelifted version include aesthetic exterior changes, mechanical changes, and interior features. Externally, the designs of the headlights and bumpers were revised. Some changes were made to the range of available engines and manual and automatic gearboxes, with the 1.4\u00a0TSI and 1.8\u00a0TSI engines and the seven-speed direct-shift gearbox transmission available for the first time. Inside the car, the stereo and steering wheels were revised, along with some of the interior trim.\n\nThe third-generation Octavia was revealed on 11 December 2012, at the \u0160koda museum in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav. The car began to appear in showrooms in key European markets in February 2013.\n\nPreviously, photos of the car covered in light camouflage were released to the media in late October 2012, after other pre-production cars had already been spotted on several occasions during the same month. It was once again spotted, this time without camouflage, on 18 November 2012, in Santiago, Chile, in both sedan and estate body styles, during the filming of a TV advertisement.\nThe car, designed by Jozef Kaba\u0148, recalls the VisionD concept car presented in 2011. The new model is longer and wider than the second generation and the wheelbase lengthened by . It is also up to 102\u00a0kg lighter than the previous model. The interior length of the third-generation \u0160KODA Octavia has grown - in comparison to its predecessor - by to , while the legroom for the backseat passengers grew by to now . The headroom in the back was increased to (Octavia II: ). The elbow width was also increased, in the front by to , and in the rear by to . Similarly, the shoulder room was optimised, in the front to by adding , and in the rear to , a plus of . The luggage compartment volume is a class leading , slightly more than the of the previous generation model or of the larger Volkswagen Passat. From May 2013, Octavia customers wishing to carry more can opt for the Combi (estate) version with its luggage capacity.\n\nThe third-generation Octavia is the first \u0160koda car to feature front radar and a multifunction camera. The radar sensor in the front bumper monitors the area in front of the vehicle and continually evaluates the distance, direction, and speed of all nearby objects (not only traffic). This radar provides data for two assistants in the Octavia: Front Assistant (forward collision warning and emergency braking) and Adaptive Cruise Assistant (adaptive cruise control). A monochromatic fixed-focus multifunction camera is mounted on the windscreen in front of the rear mirror, and allows function of Lane Assistant (lane keeping system), Intelligent Light Assistant (automatic control of the high beams) and Traffic Sign Recognition (recognises and shows traffic signs on displays of both on-board computer and satellite navigation). Added to this are assists, whose functionality is based on evaluating data provided by ESC or steering sensors: Crew Protect Assistant (proactive passenger protection), and Driver Activity Assistant (fatigue detection).\n\nThe Octavia features numerous so-called \u2018Simply Clever\u2018 details, i.e. an ice scraper inside the fuel filler flap, a rubbish bin inside the door panel, and a double-sided (rubber/textile) floor mat in the boot. A tilting/sliding panoramic sunroof is available as an option \u2013 single-piece for the Octavia sedan and two-piece for the Octavia Combi. The Bolero, Amundsen, and Columbus car radios are protected against theft by the physical separation of the central display and the multimedia system\u2019s own central unit. The Octavia also offers a Phone Box, a storage compartment for the mobile phone with planar antenna in the bottom of the compartment, which permits a so-called inductive exterior antenna connection.\n\nFor the front-wheel Octavia, engine outputs are offered of 63\u2013132\u00a0kW (86\u2013179 PS) on petrol/gasoline cars and 66\u2013110\u00a0kW (90\u2013150 PS) for the diesel engines. The two environmentally friendly versions of the Octavia are: the GreenLine version with 1.6-litre diesel produces only 85 grams of CO per km; the G-TEC is fitted with 1.4-litre TSI engine running on CNG and emitting 97 grams of CO per km. The all-wheel drive Octavia Combi can be powered by one petrol (1.8 TSI/132\u00a0kW) and three diesel engines (ranging from 77-135\u00a0kW).\n\nThe Octavia RS, available in both the sedan and estate body styles, was premiered at the Goodwood Festival of Speed 2013. It features the 162\u00a0kW (220 PS) 2.0 TSI engine from the newly launched Golf 7 GTI and the 135\u00a0kW (184 PS) 2.0 TDI engine from the Golf 7 GTD. With a top speed of , the Octavia RS with petrol engine and manual gearbox was acclaimed to be the fastest production Octavia ever. In comparison with standard car, the sports Octavia features progressive steering (variable-ratio steering), sports chassis, electronic differential lock (XDS) and so-called \u2018Performance Sound Generator\u2018, that enhances sporty sound of the engine. The source of sound vibrations is the electromagnetic pulse generator placed in the area under/in front of the windshield. The sound vibrations are spreading into the car\u2019s cabin through the body and the windshield. The frequency and intensity of the sound is dependent not only on the profile chosen, but also the engine revolutions, driving speed and engine load (the throttle pedal position). The generated sound is directed inside the cabin, especially to the front seat area. \u0160koda used the 2015 Geneva Motor Show to shine the spotlight on its new and more powerful Octavia RS 230. The car has 230 PS (10 PS more than stock) and this helps it shave a tenth off its benchmark sprint time and adds 2\u00a0km/h to the car\u2019s top speed which increases to 250\u00a0km/h (155\u00a0mph); it also gets a standard electronic differential in this version and lower, stiffer springs.\n\nIn early 2014, \u0160koda revealed the Scout; it has raised suspension, plastic cladding, and four-wheel drive.\n\nIn early 2017, the third-generation facelift Octavia arrived in the showrooms, with the main visible difference being the split front headlights.\n\nOverview of engines available for the third-generation Octavia (A7, Typ 5E) with front-wheel drive, including vRS version.\n\nPetrol engines\nDiesel engines\n\n(*)CNG consumption in m3/100\u00a0km. Consumption of 1 m3 of CNG is adequate to 1 l of petrol.\n\nOverview of engines available for the 3rd-generation Octavia Combi 4x4 (A7, Typ 5E) with all-wheel drive, incl. the Scout version.\n\nPetrol engines\nDiesel engines\nOn 10 January 2017 in Vienna, \u0160koda presented the third-generation Octavia facelift. The main changes brought mainly split front headlights, solid centre section on the front grille and a new system for predictive pedestrian protection. Plastic (exterior) side door mouldings were absent on the facelift Scout model. The first cars were delivered to customers before spring.\n\nThe fourth generation Octavia was revealed in Prague on 11 November 2019. It will be delivered to customers from June 2020, but was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic.\n"

    "text": "Cheer Up! is the fourth full-length release from ska punk band Reel Big Fish.\n\nIt is a slight departure from the band's other releases, veering toward more of a rock sound as opposed to ska, especially on the first five tracks, where nary a syncopated drum beat or upstroke on the guitar is heard. Nevertheless, the album is a continuation of the band's longstanding tradition of putting self-loathing lyrics to upbeat music. The album also shows Reel Big Fish expanding their musical styles past the pop-rock sound, as it contains an a cappella cover of Frank Sinatra's classic \"New York, New York\" as well as a cover of Sublime's \"Boss DJ\". Additionally, the track \"Drunk Again\" and the international bonus track \"Average Man\" are sung by Reel Big Fish trumpeter-guitarist-pianist-vocalist Scott Klopfenstein. Both song have with a style differing from the traditional Reel Big Fish sound, and the former song was later performed by Klopfenstein's side project The Littlest Man Band. The band later stated, perhaps jokingly, that the song was accidentally put on the album and was intended to have been on a Littlest Man Band album instead. The CD cover art of the evil clown for this album was drawn by Aaron Barrett's father.\n\nBetween late June and mid-August, the group went on the 2002 edition of Warped Tour. The hornless single, \"Where Have You Been?\", was a moderate success in 2002, helping album sales.\n\nAll songs written and arranged by Reel Big Fish (A. Barrett, C. de la Garza, S. Klopfenstein, D.

    "text": "Avigail Atari (, born December 29, 1953) is an Israeli singer and actress. Atari won the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 which was held in Jerusalem, Israel, as part of Milk and Honey.\n\nAtari was born in Rehovot, Israel, to Jewish parents who immigrated to Israel from Yemen. She is the sister of Yona Atari, a singer and actress, and the late Shosh Atari, a radio host and TV personality. Her father died when she was four years old, and, after his death, her family moved to live in Tel-Aviv.\n\nAtari was introduced to the Israeli musician David Kribushe when she was 15 years old. After an audition for him, he gave her a featured singing part in one of his songs \u201cHalf and Half\u201d. In 1970, when she was 17 years old, she recorded two songs. The first song was in English, and it was called \u201cGive Love Away\u201d. The second song was a Hebrew song called \u201cIm yesh lecha shemesh\u201d (If You Have the Sun). The song became a big hit in Israel, and Atari represented Israel at the World Popular Song Festival in Japan. Atari participated in the contest again in 1976, this time with the song \"The Same Old Game\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, Atari\u2019s career was progressing slowly. She recorded the song \u201csal eretz hachalom\u201d (About the Land of Dream), which did not get much attention, and in 1975 she participated in the Hassidic Song Festival with the song \u201cLeyerushalyim Yirech\u201d (To your city of Jerusalem) and won second place. In 1978, Atari performed the song \"Nesich hachlomot\" (Dream Prince), along with musicians Zvi Bums and Udi Spielman, at the Festival Hazemer Ha'ivri - the Israeli qualification heat for the Eurovision Song Contest. She placed third at the festival and released a successful album by the same name as her third place song. Atari, undeterred by not winning the qualification heat for the Eurovision, entered again in 1979, this time as female vocalist with the Milk and Honey. They won, and their song, \u201cHallelujah\u201d, represented Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest Song Contest staged in Jerusalem on March 31. The song was voted the winner and was a success on the European charts.\n\nAfter their Eurovision Song Contest win, Atari kept performing with Milk and Honey. They recorded a few more songs, many of which became great hits like \u201cGalgal Anak\u201d (Big Wheel), which won the title Song of the year for 1980, \u201cShir Lashirim\u201d (A Song for the Songs), \u201cYachad\u201d (Together), and \u201cUlay Od Kayitz\u201d (Maybe One Summer).\n\nIn 1980, after a year of working together, Atari retired from Milk and Honey as a result of a lawsuit she filed against her manager, Shlomo Tasch. Atari claimed in court that she was not paid for about sixty performances on TV and in Europe and that once she left Milk and Honey a new vocalist was introduced and released an album with songs she recorded under the new vocalist\u2019s name. The trial dragged on for 14 years and concluded with a win for Atari, who was awarded 800,000 Shekels (about $227,000).\n\nIn 1981 Atari, working with the producer Yeroslav Yahakivovitch, recorded a rock album titled \"Kach Oti Habayta\" (Take Me Home). The album included hits including \u201cDuet Preda\u201d (Goodbye Duet) \u201cLo Yoda'at\u201d (I Don\u2019t Know), and \u201cShelcha Ad Etmol\u201d (Yours until Yesterday).\n\nIn 1986 Atari released her fourth album \"Emtza September\" (Middle of September). The album quickly became her most successful album up to that point, selling over 30,000 copies and prompting Atari to go on a successful concert tour as a soloist for the first time in her career.\n\nAtari\u2019s success continued through the 80s as the singer released two more albums, \"Tza'ad Echad Lifnei Hanahar\" (One Step before the River), which sold over 80,000 copies in 1988 and \"Bereshit\" (Genesis), which sold 15,000 copies in 1989.\n\nIn 1991 Atari released her first greatest hits album, titled \"Rak Etmol\" (Only Yesterday). The album was successful and sold over 20,000 copies.\n\nIn 1992 the album \"Bayom Sh\u00e9achrei\" (The Day After) was released, and Atari was named the Singer of the Year by the Israeli radio station Reshet Gimel.\n\nIn 1994 she was requested by Israeli children's series Shirim K'tanim to work with Uzi Hitman. She was involved in the Passover video and sang a lot of the festival songs.\n\nIn 1996 Atai gave birth to her only child, Li, which inspired her to release an album titled Glida (Ice Cream). Even though the songs were written by the most popular songwriters in Israel at the time like Kobie Oz, Asthar Shamir and Shalom Chanoch, the album was not successful.\n\nIn 2003 Atari released her album \"Chabeck Oti L\u00e9at\" (Hug Me Slowly). The song \u201cMa Sh\u00e9at Ohevet\" (What It Is that You Love) became successful and was adopted by many Israeli teenage girls as the celebration song for their Bat Mitzva celebrations.\n\nIn 2008, after her sister Shosh Atari\u2019s death, she released her album \"Bein Ha\u00e9sh Levein Hamayim\" (Between Fire and Water), which was dedicated to her sister.\n\nIn 2011, Atari released a few singles on the radio from an album in the works with the musician Amir Benayun. The album has yet to be released. In an interview on 2/17/2014 Atari said \u201cThe album is not happening right now, but I wouldn\u2019t hurry to call the project canceled. I believe in this project but I need to find the correct time for this project.\u201d \n\nIn 2012, she was approached to do a PR film for Hadassim youth village where she grew up, she refused.\nIn February 2014 a new album was announced and a new single \u201cAhava Lemaerchakim Arukim\u201d (Long-distance Love) was released.\nIn 2019 when approached to revive the song that won her the Eurovision song contest at the 1979 competition, she refused to sing with her former team mates, Milk and Honey members Reuven Gvirtz, Shmulik Bilu and Yehuda Tamir.\nInstead, she sung the song as a solo artist, and almost immediately after joined by fellow past contestants Conchita Wurst, M\u00e5ns Zelmerlow, Verka Serduchka, and Eleni Foureira.\n\n\n"

    "text": "Asteroid is a 1997 NBC TV miniseries about the United States government trying to prevent an asteroid from colliding with the Earth.\n\nLate one night, near Billings, Montana, a gas tanker is driving by when a meteoroid suddenly hits in front of the truck. The driver attempts to swerve out of the way, but loses control and overturns and the tanker explodes, causing a massive fire.\n\nThe next morning, the fire is burning out of control and it is reported that the tanker was hit by a lightning bolt. With the area evacuated, FEMA Director Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn), and a colleague, Adam Marquez (Carlos G\u00f3mez) are flying via helicopter over the area, inspecting the fire, when they notice that two people are still in the area. It's a man on the roof of his house, trying to save it, despite his wife's protests.\n\nJack and Adam land and take the woman aboard, despite her angry protest in concern of her husband. Her husband starts to suffer from smoke inhalation when Jack manages to get him aboard the helicopter. Jack just barely manages to escape as a propane tank causes a massive explosion and destroys the home. They escape.\n\nLater that evening, at the National Observatory in Boulder, Colorado, Dr. Lily McKee (Annabella Sciorra), the Observatory's director, is observing a comet which is going to pass by Earth on the 4th of July. Later on, when she goes home and looks at some photos, she sees what she believes are asteroids.\n\nThe next day, she informs Jack and Adam of the possibility of an impact and calls them in. She tells them of two asteroids: Helios and Eros, whose orbits have been disrupted by the comet and may hit the Earth. Helios would hit with the force of 1,000 Hiroshima bombs and generate temperatures five times hotter than the Sun in the area of impact. Everything within a 150-mile radius would be destroyed and the impact would also spray molten rock another 70 miles.\n\nEros is four miles across and would cause a global ecological disaster if it did indeed hit. Then, Max Jenson (Brian Hill), one of Lily's assistants, informs Lily, Jack and Adam that Helios is getting closer to the Earth and that the observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii had picked up some smaller asteroids that the National Observatory cannot see and they believe that a small one hit Montana. Jack and Adam realize that the fire was indeed caused by an asteroid impact.\n\nLater on, Lily and Max check Helios' trajectory and realize that it will indeed hit the Earth. Their numbers show that Helios will hit in the Kansas City area within about 48 hours. They tell the president about it and he orders that the city be evacuated ASAP. Ultimately a fragment of Helios strikes a dam in the Kansas City area, causing flooding in the city. Wallach, who drives into the city to rescue two stranded firefighters and a drunk driver who struck their vehicle, gets caught in the flood. He and the firefighters survive, but the drunk driver dies.\n\nUnfortunately it is discovered Eros will hit also and will be an extinction-level event. The United States attempts to destroy Eros using lasers mounted on three jet fighter aircraft, but one of the lasers is damaged when the jet carrying it takes off and climbs to altitude through a violent storm. After making some last-minute adjustments, the lasers on the other two aircraft are used to seemingly destroy Eros, unfortunately, it is discovered that the mission was only partially successful. Instead of destroying the asteroid, the lasers broke it into many small, yet deadly pieces.\n\nThe largest piece and several smaller fragments of Eros hit Dallas, Texas, where Lily's son and Lily's father are. The city is devastated by the impacts and blast of heat. Lily desperately searches the city for her father and son who survive the blast and aftershocks, but her father ends up trapped and hurt in the ruins of the hospital where he worked and her son Elliot wanders off trying to find help. After a search, Lily locates her father and with the help of nearby firemen, rescues him, but goes on to try to rescue Elliot while the soldier who accompanied her goes back to base, although a fireman does accompany her. The two search the ruined city and finally locate Elliot in a large impact crater created by the largest fragment. Jack shows up to help in a helicopter, having learned their location from Lily's former escort. He rescues Elliot and the four return to base where they watch the comet pass by Earth and are relieved it won't return to cause trouble for another 4,000 years.\n\n\"Asteroid\" won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects.\n"

    "title": "Time delay and integration",
    "text": "A time delay and integration or time delay integration (TDI) charge-coupled device (CCD) is an image sensor for capturing images of moving objects at low light levels. The motion it can capture is similar to that captured by a line-scan CCD which uses a single line of photo-sensitive elements to capture one image strip of a scene that is moving at a right angle to the line of elements. A line-scan CCD needs to have high light levels, however, in order to register the light quickly before the motion causes smearing of the image. The TDI CCD overcomes this illumination limitation by having multiple rows of elements which each shift their partial measurements to the adjacent row synchronously with the motion of the image across the array of elements. This provides high sensitivity for moving images unobtainable using conventional CCD arrays or single-line-scan devices.\n\nThe TDI CCD improves upon the single-line-scan system by adding the photocharges of its multiple lines.\nTDI CCD is especially used in scanning of moving objects, for example letter and film scanning, or from a moving platform, for example aerial reconnaissance.\n\n"

    "title": "Shrewsbury Canal",
    "text": "The Shrewsbury Canal (or Shrewsbury and Newport Canal) was a canal in Shropshire, England. Authorised in 1793, the main line from Trench to Shrewsbury was fully open by 1797, but it remained isolated from the rest of the canal network until 1835, when the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal built the Newport Branch from Norbury Junction to a new junction with the Shrewsbury Canal at Wappenshall. After ownership passed to a series of railway companies, the canal was officially abandoned in 1944; many sections have disappeared, though some bridges and other structures can still be found. There is an active campaign to preserve the remnants of the canal and to restore the Norbury to Shrewsbury line to navigation.\n\nFrom 1768 several small canals were built in the area of what is now Telford. These canals carried tub boats. The first of these was the Donnington Wood Canal which opened in 1768, to be followed by the Wombridge Canal and the Ketley Canal, both opened in 1788, and the Shropshire Canal, which opened in 1791. The network linked Lilleshall and Pave Lane in the north to Coalbrookdale and Coalport in the south. Following a survey of the route by George Young from Worcester in 1792, an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1793 which authorised the creation of a canal to link the town of Shrewsbury with the east Shropshire canal network serving coal mines and ironworks around Oakengates, Ketley, Donnington Wood and Trench, nowadays part of the new town of Telford. The act authorised the raising of \u00a350,000 in shares, and an additional \u00a320,000 if necessary. This canal became the Shrewsbury Canal, and incorporated of the Wombridge Canal, which were purchased for \u00a3840 from William Reynolds to provide access to the Donnington Wood Canal and the Shropshire Canal.\n\nJosiah Clowes was appointed Chief Engineer, but died in 1795 part way through construction. He was succeeded by Thomas Telford, then just establishing himself as Shropshire's County Surveyor and already engaged on the Ellesmere Canal slightly further north. The Ellesmere Canal was originally intended to connect Chester with Shrewsbury, but never reached the latter \u2013 it became the modern Llangollen Canal and Montgomery Canal.\n\nOne of Telford's first tasks was to build Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct as a rebuild of a stone aqueduct over the River Tern at Longdon-on-Tern which had been built by Clowes but swept away by floods in February 1795. Telford's stonemason instincts initially led him to consider replacing the original structure with another stone-built aqueduct, but the heavy involvement of iron-masters in the Shrewsbury Canal Company, notably William Reynolds, led him to reconsider. Instead, it was rebuilt using a cast iron trough cast in sections at Reynolds' Ketley ironworks and bolted together in 1796. The main trough was wide and deep, with a narrower trough to one side which formed the towpath. The aqueduct was the world's first large-scale iron navigable aqueduct, though it was narrowly predated by a much smaller structure on the Derby Canal built by Benjamin Outram. The aqueduct still stands today, though it is isolated in the middle of a field. This successful use of an iron trough to contain the water of a navigable aqueduct casts the Tern aqueduct in the role of Telford's prototype for the much longer Pontcysyllte Aqueduct on the Llangollen Canal, where he mounted the iron trough on high masonry arches.\n\nThe Shrewsbury Canal was finally finished in 1797, being long, with 11 locks. At Trench an inclined plane was built, which was long and raised boats up to the Wombridge Canal, from where they could travel via the Shropshire Canal southwards to the River Severn at Coalport. The plane consisted of twin railway tracks, each of which held a cradle. Boats would be floated onto the cradles, which had larger wheels at the back to keep the boat level. A third set of wheels were mounted at the front, which ran on extra rails in the dock, to prevent the cradle tipping forwards as it ran over the top cill. The plane opened in 1794, and although it was partially counterbalanced, with loaded boats going down the plane pulling empty boats up, a steam engine was also provided, to pull the boats over the top cill. This and the rails were provided by Reynolds' Coalbrookdale Company. In 1840 the rails were replaced with edge rails, allowing the use of conventional flanged wheels on the cradles, and the engine was replaced in 1842, with a high pressure Cornish engine, again ordered from the Coalbrookdale Company. The plane continued to be used until 1921, making it the last operational plane in Britain.\nThe canal included a tunnel at Berwick, which was wide, but included a wooden towpath, supported by bearers which were attached to the wall. Clowes designed the tunnel, but the addition of a towpath was suggested by Reynolds. The towpath lasted until 1819, when it was removed. By 1904, there was a white line painted in the middle of the tunnel, and if boats travelling in opposite directions met in the tunnel, the one which had passed the mark had right of way.\n\nThe canal was originally built as a narrow canal intended for horse-drawn trains of tub boats which were long and no wider than . However, in preparation for the Newport branch of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to Wappenshall the section from there to Shrewsbury was surveyed in 1831 and subsequently widened to take standard narrow boats. The costs of widening the bridge holes and the Eyton locks proved to be expensive, and plans to widen the section from Wappenshall to Trench were abandoned. With the opening of the Newport Branch in 1835, the Shrewsbury Canal was no longer isolated from the rest of the national canal network. This heralded the canal's most profitable period, though it was short-lived. The branch linked Norbury Junction to Wappenshall Junction, passing through Newport, and included 23 locks.\n\nIn 1844 the Humber Arm was constructed. This short branch ran to Lubstree Wharf, which was owned by the Duke of Sutherland. Tramways ran from the end of the branch to various works owned by the Lilleshall Company, who shipped cargoes of pig iron, coal and limestone for use as a flux in the production of iron. Much of this trade had previously used the Donnington Wood Canal, but the new arm provided a more direct connection to the canal network, and the transfer of trade was a factor in the closure of the Donnington Wood Canal.\n\nMost of the traffic on the canal was coal, bound for Shrewsbury. Tolls were charged at d per ton per mile, with an extra 1d to use the inclined plane. This was high, compared to other canals, and the rate was reduced to 1d per ton per mile in 1797, while Reynolds was allowed to ship iron and other commodities toll-free for a time. However, in 1799, the company raised the tolls to 2d. This led to some discontent, with the local newspaper complaining that rather than reducing the price of coal, the townspeople were paying two to three shillings more per ton than before the canal had been built. The enterprise was prosperous, with dividends on the \u00a3125 shares rising to \u00a38 in 1805, \u00a310 in 1823 and \u00a311 in 1929. Immediately after the opening of the Newport branch, they reached \u00a316, but were back to \u00a310 by 1843. The coal producers complained about the tolls in 1843, but the canal company argued that they were charging too much for the coal, and lower tolls would not improve the situation. However, tolls were reduced to d in 1844, and the producers reduced the price of coal by 2s\u00a06d.\n\nIn May 1845, the amalgamation of the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal and the Ellesmere and Chester Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament, and there were schemes to build railways throughout the area that they served. The railway engineer Robert Stephenson held a meeting on 24 July, at which he proposed further amalgamation of canal and railway interests, in order to make the task of obtaining authorising acts easier. In addition to the enlarged Ellesmere and Chester Canal, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company would absorb the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. While many miles of waterway would be replaced by railway, some would be retained in water, which included the Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Burbridge Junction section, the Shropshire Canal and the Shrewsbury Canal. Three Acts of Parliament were obtained in 1846, to enable railway construction, and extra clauses enabled the name change to the Shropshire Union to be made, and the acquisition of the Shrewsbury Canal. At the time there were 500 shares in the Shrewsbury Canal, on which holders had paid \u00a3125, and these were valued at \u00a3150 each, which valued the canal at \u00a375,000.\n\nThe first railway to be constructed was the Stafford to Shrewsbury Line, as it could be built quickly, and would be a great asset to the area. It was also stated that \"its construction will not involve the loss of any revenue from the canals.\" Realignments of various railway companies resulted in the formation of the London and North Western Railway Company (LNWR) on 1 January 1846, and they saw the Shropshire Union scheme as a threat. They therefore offered to lease the Shropshire Union in late 1846, and an Act to authorise this was obtained in June 1847. Conditions of the lease, which was not fully completed until 25 March 1857, meant that the Shropshire Union dropped all plans for further railway expansion, but they were given a free hand to run the canals as they saw fit. However, Robert Skey, the canal manager, when he addressed a meeting in September 1861, noted that the carriage of general merchandise had suffered, as it had gradually transferred to the railways.\n\nIn 1870, a plan to reduce the costs of maintaining the Trench incline resulted in the company leasing Lubstree wharf from the third Duke of Sutherland. A new railway was built from the wharf to the Lilleshall Company works, and a wharfage charge of one halfpenny per ton for coal and other merchandise was agreed. The Shropshire Union set aside 30 boats to cope with the traffic, and in 1878 tolls for iron ore from Ellesmere Port to Lubstree were reduced, but by 1880, the only traffic on the Humber Arm was fluxing stone. In order to improve its use, the Shropshire Union agreed rates for carrying 300 to 400 tons of limestone and 100 to 150 tons of iron ore per week, and these measures were successful, as a further railway siding was built when the lease was renewed in 1891, and it was renewed for a further 14 years in 1905. Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct was in a poor state of repair by 1899, when the company looked at closing the canal from Eyton to Shrewsbury, but the legal difficulties of a railway company closing a canal meant that it stayed open.\n\nIn its later years, the Trench incline had only carried grain upwards to Donnington Wood mill, and the incline was closed on 31 August 1921. \nIn 1922, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) took over the canal and the basin in Shrewsbury was closed. This action saved the cost of replacing the swing bridge at the basin entrance. Traffic on the Humber Arm ended in 1922, when the fifth Duke of Sutherland closed the wharf and the railway line to Lilleshall. No traffic used the canal to Shrewsbury after 1936, and a further section beyond Comet bridge was abandoned in 1939. Small volumes of coal were still reaching Longdon in 1939, and just 100 tons per year were recorded on the Newport Branch in 1943. The LMS finally abandoned the canal network in 1944, when they obtained an Act of Abandonment. The Shrewsbury Canal was just a small part of the abandoned under the 1944 Act. Following the transfer of responsibility for the canal network to British Waterways in 1963, much of the route of the canal was sold to local landowners.\n\nIn 2000, the Shrewsbury Canal was the only one of the canals that formed part of the Shropshire Union Canal system which had no part open or under restoration. The Shrewsbury & Newport Canals Trust was created in that year to preserve and restore the waterway.\n\nIn 2007, the canalside buildings at Wappenshall, including a transshipment warehouse which has been little altered since it ceased to be used in the 1930s, and retains many original features, were put up for sale. They were eventually purchased, along with a length of the canal and the Wappenshall basin, by Telford and Wrekin Council, who are working with the Trust to allow repairs to the buildings to be undertaken, with the aim of providing a museum and heritage centre for the canal, a caf\u00e9, and offices for the Canals Trust.\n\nIn August 2015, work began on a short section of the canal to the east of Newport, between Forton Aqueduct and Skew Bridge. The channel at this location is still owned by the Canal and River Trust who supported the work by the Trust and the Waterway Recovery Group, which involves reprofiling the bed and laying a Bentonite lining, with a view to rewatering the section in the summer of 2016. The waterproof lining was supplied by the Inland Waterways Association.\n\nThe canal branched away from the Shropshire Union Canal at Norbury Junction, passing under a stone bridge which carried the Shropshire Union towpath over the branch. The bridge is a Grade II listed structure. The section to the first lock is still in water as it is used for moorings, while the first lock is used as a dry dock. The lock was the first in a flight of 17, which lowered the canal down the hillside as it passed through Oulton and to the south of Sutton and Forton. At the bottom of the flight, the canal and a minor road crossed the River Meese on the Forton Aqueduct, before passing under Skew Bridge which carries the road over the canal. The aqueduct is a scheduled ancient monument. The River Meese feeds the Aquelate Mere, which is a National Nature Reserve and the largest lake in the West Midlands region, covering . Soon afterwards, the route of the canal has been cut by the building of the A41 Newport bypass.\n\nBeyond the bypass, Meretown lock marks the start of a watered section, which passes through Newport and included another five locks. The Strine Brook passes under the canal at both ends of this section, running parallel to the canal between the two aqueducts. The canal passed under Buttery Bridge, and then over Kinnersley Drive on an aqueduct, before the junction with the Humber Branch, which ran for about to the south, and served the industrial complex of Lilleshall. Two more aqueducts carried it over the Humber Brook and the Crow Brook, before the junction at Wappenshall where the new branch joined the original canal from Trench to Shrewsbury. At the junction, the warehouses, basin and a section of the canal have been bought by Telford and Wrekin Council, and include a Grade II Listed warehouse which straddled a dock, so that goods could be loaded and unloaded through trapdoors in the floor of the upper storey.\n\nThe Trench branch rose through 9 locks from the junction, which were called Wappenshall, Britton, Wheat Leasowes, Shucks, Peaty, Hadley Park, Turnip, Baker's and Trench lock. Wappenshall Lock was demolished to make way for a weir which is part of a storm drain. Hadley Park and Turnip locks are Grade II listed structures, as is the bridge immediately downstream of Hadley Park lock, and both locks still have their original guillotine mechanism in situ. Beyond Trench lock, which was demolished in 1977 as part of a roadworks scheme, the Trench Pool was the main water supply for the canal, after which the Trench incline carried boats another upwards. The building of an incline, rather than a flight of locks was dictated by the lack of an adequate water supply at the higher level. The locks on the Trench Branch, and the two Eyton locks, had guillotine gates at the lower end. They were long, and although Thomas Telford wrote in 1797 that they had a third set of gates, so that they could be used by a single tub-boat in the short section, a train of three tub-boats in the longer section, or a train of four boats if the outer gates were used, there is no evidence that the middle gates were ever fitted.\n\nAfter Wappenshall junction the canal dropped down through the two Eyton locks, which were widened when the Newport Branch was built, passing to the north of Eyton upon the Weald Moors and through Sleapford, before crossing the River Tern on the aqueduct at Longdon-on-Tern. The canal then headed south-west, skirting the southern edge of Rodington, where it crossed the River Roden on an aqueduct which was demolished in January 1971, and the eastern and southern edge of Withington, where there was a wharf. It passed under the Shrewsbury to Telford railway line south of Upton Magna, where the new line of the A5 road has blocked the line of the canal, to reach Berwick Wharf. Here it turned north-west, to enter the Berwick Tunnel. At the time of its construction, this was the longest canal tunnel in Britain, and the first equipped with a towpath through it. From the northern portal of the tunnel, it passed under the railway and the A5 road again, heading north to Uffington, after which it followed the large horseshoe bend in the River Severn to reach Shrewsbury where it terminated at Castle Foregate Basin adjacent to the Buttermarket building.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "The right of reply or right of correction generally means the right to defend oneself against public criticism in the same venue where it was published. In some countries, such as Brazil, it is a legal or even constitutional right. In other countries, it is not a legal right as such, but a right which certain media outlets and publications choose to grant to people who have been severely criticised by them, as a matter of editorial policy.\n\nThe Brazilian Constitution guarantees the right of reply (\"direito de resposta\").\n\nIn Europe, there have been proposals for a legally enforceable right of reply that applies to all media, including newspapers, magazines, and other print media, along with radio, television, and the internet. In 1974, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe already voted a resolution granting a right of reply to all individuals. Article 1 of a 2004 Council of Europe recommendation defined a right of reply as: \"offering a possibility to react to any information in the media presenting inaccurate facts \u2026 which affect \u2026 personal rights\".\n\nIn the federal system of Germany, the individual federal states are responsible for education, cultural affairs, and also the press and electronic media. All press laws of the 16 federal states guarantee the right to a counter presentation of factual statements which are deemed to be wrong by the individuals and organisations concerned. This is based on article 11 the national press law of 1874, and is found in all 16 laws as \u00a711 or \u00a710 in slightly modified versions.\n\nAustria and Switzerland have similar laws on the book. In Austria this is in article 9 of the national media law, in Switzerland in article 28g of the civil code.\n\nIn France, the right to a corrective reply goes back to the and is renewed and extended to broadcast and digital media via various laws and decrees.\n\nThe Belgian law on the right to reply emerged in 1831 as article 13 of the 1831 decree on the press. This was replaced 130 years later by the law on the \"droit de r\u00e9ponse\" or \u00abloi du 23 juin 1961\u00bb. Originally referring only to the printed press, this law was amended in 1977 by the law of \u00ab4 mars 1977 relative au droit de r\u00e9ponse dans l\u2019audiovisuel\u00bb i.e. audiovisual media, published in the \"Moniteur Belge\" of March 15, 1977. Since the federalisation of the Belgian state in 1980, the language communities are responsible for the media, and so the Flemish community has passed in 2005 a decr\u00e9e dated March 4, 2005, which regulates the right to reply in articles 177 to 199, and the German language community has passed the decree of 27 June 2005, which simply refers to the law of 1961 as amended in 1977.\n\nIn Poland \"the editor-in-chief of the competent daily newspaper or magazine shall publish, free of charge, the subject-matter and factual correction of inaccurate or untrue press material\".\n\nThe United Nations recognises the \"International Right of Correction\" through the \"Convention on the International Right of Correction\", which entered into force on August 24, 1962.\n\nA Florida right of reply law (referring to print media) was overturned by \"Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo\", 418 U.S. 241 (1974), while a FCC policy (referring to broadcast media) was affirmed in \"Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC\", 395 U.S. 367 (1969).\n\nA right of reply can also be part of the editorial policy of a news publication or an academic journal. The BBC's Editorial Guidelines state:\n\nWhen our output makes allegations of wrongdoing, iniquity or incompetence or lays out a strong and damaging critique of an individual or institution the presumption is that those criticised should be given a \"right of reply\", that is, given a fair opportunity to respond to the allegations.\n\nThe \"Australasian Journal of Philosophy\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editorial policy says:\n\n[A]uthors of the materials being commented on [in Discussion Notes] may be given a right of reply (subject to the usual refereeing), on the understanding that timely publication of the Note will take priority over the desirability of including both Note and Reply in the same issue of the Journal.\n\n\n"

    "text": "Lockier Clere Burges (c. 1814\u201331 July 1886) was an early settler in colonial Western Australia who became a leading pastoralist in the colony, and a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council.\n\nLockier Burges was born at Fethard in Tipperary, Ireland around 1814. In 1829, he emigrated to Western Australia with his two brothers William Burges and Samuel Evans Burges. The three brothers sailed for the Swan River Colony on board the \"Warrior\", arriving in March 1830. The brothers settled on of virgin land at the junction of Ellen Brook and the Swan River at Upper Swan until 1837, before taking up of land at York. They named their new selection Tipperary in honour of their birthplace. In 1849, Lockier and William Burges moved to the Champion Bay area, leaving Samuel at Tipperary. Initially Lockier was Superintendent of the Geraldine lead mine. In 1851 Lockier Burges selected the homestead site for \"Irwin House\" on the Irwin River about inland from the modern site of Dongara. Burges, in partnership with Edward Hamersley, Samuel Pole Phillips and Bartholomew Urban Vigors, making up the pastoral group called \"The Cattle Company\", were granted grazing leases over of land along the Irwin River and Greenough Flats, securing for the company a virtual monopoly of land in the area.\n\nIn January 1860 Burges visited Ireland, returning to Western Australia in November 1862.\n\nBurges is noted in ornithology for specimens of birds obtained at York, supplied to John Gilbert and recorded by John Gould in \"Birds of Australia\". Amongst the poorly known species he provided was one of the pied honeyeater \"Certhionyx variegatus\" and the type specimen of the grey falcon \"Falco hypoleucos\".\n\nOn 14 January 1879, Lockier Burges was nominated to the Western Australian Legislative Council. He held the position until 2 July 1884. In his final years he retired to Perth, where he died, unmarried, on 31 July 1886.\n"

    "text": "John Garrett Bussell (16 August 1803 \u2013 17 September 1875) was an early settler in Western Australia.\n\nJohn Garrett Bussell was born at Portsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire in England on 16 August 1803. He was educated at Winchester College in England, but after the death of his father the family decided to emigrate to Western Australia. John Bussell and three of his brothers sailed for Western Australia on board the \"Warrior\" late in 1829, with the rest of the Bussell family to follow once the brothers were established.\n\nOn arriving at the Swan River Colony in March 1830, the Bussell brothers were advised that most of the good land near the Swan River had already been granted. The Governor of Western Australia, Sir James Stirling suggested they instead join with a number of other families in joining a new sub-colony at Augusta. The following month, Stirling sailed with a party of prospective settlers on board the \"Emily Taylor\". After arriving at the mouth of the Blackwood River, the party spent four days exploring the area. Stirling then confirmed his decision to establish a subcolony, the settlers' property was disembarked, and the town of Augusta declared at the site.\n\nFor four years the brothers tried unsuccessfully to establish a farm, initially at Augusta and then further up the Blackwood River. The brothers had immense difficulty clearing the land, and found the soil not particularly good for farming. John Bussell conducted numerous exploring expeditions in search of better land. He was particularly impressed with the quality of land at Busselton (then known as the Vasse), and explored the area thoroughly. When the Bussell's home was destroyed by fire in 1834, the family re-established themselves at the Vasse, where they became successful and prosperous farmers. John Bussell would remain at the homestead \"Cattle Chosen\", now in Bovell, until his death.\n\nJohn Bussell returned to England in 1837, with the intention of marrying his sweetheart Sophie Hayward. His relationship with her soured while he was in England, and their engagement was called off. However shortly after gaining his freedom Bussell met a widow named Charlotte Cookworthy (sister-in-law of Joseph Cookworthy), to whom he became engaged three weeks later. After marrying her in August 1838, they returned to Western Australia in 1839.\n\nBussell became a Justice of the Peace in 1855, and a member of the Vasse Board of Education in 1861. During 1864 he taught at Bishop Hale's School (now Hale School) in Perth. He later undertook theological studies, but was never ordained. From 4 November 1870 to 3 July 1872, Bussell served as a nominee Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. He died near Busselton on 17 September 1875.\n\nIn 2016, a sculpture by Greg James, \"John Garrett Bussell\", was unveiled by the City of Busselton in the ArtGeo Cultural Complex as part of the Busselton Settlement Art Project.\n\n"

    "text": "The Miknasa (Berber: \"Imeknasen\") are a Zenata Berber tribe native to the Aures region in Algeria. The tribe currently lives in Algeria and Morocco.\n\nThe Miknasa are a Zenata Berber tribe native of the Aures region (present-day Algeria).\n\nThe Berber tribe of Miknasa dominated eastern Morocco to the limit of Tafilalet during the 8th century. At the beginning of the 8th century, the Ban\u00fb Wass\u00fbl, a tribal confederation belonging to the Meknassa tribe, founded the city Sijilmasa. The Ban\u00fb Merdas, a branch of the Meknassa tribes, founded a dynasty in the south west of Algeria.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the inhabitants of Touat were close to two important cities in the Sahara, west of Sijilmasa and east of Ouargla. The Banou Midrar of Miknassa were in the East and the West and were Sufri, they found Sijilmasa and controlled the roads towards Bilad al Habech (country of the Blacks) and Bilad Sudan. These Miknissa had control of several cities including Tiaret. Their capital remains Sijilmasa, which A.G. P Martin and Zerouki (specialist in Ibadi history) confirm. The ties between Ibn Rustum, founder of Tiaret, were close with the Banou Midrar.\n\nUnlike the indigenous Maghrawa of today's Morocco, the Miknasa Berbers originated in southern Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia), but migrated westwards into central Morocco and western Algeria in pre-Islamic times. The modern Moroccan city of Meknes, which took its name from them, bears witness to their presence, as does the Spanish town of Mequinenza.\n\nAfter defeat by the Umayyads, many of the Miknasa converted to Islam. In 711, members of the tribe took part in the conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom under Tariq ibn Ziyad. They settled north of C\u00f3rdoba and in the 11th century founded the Aftasid dynasty in Badajoz.\n\nAnother group of the Miknasa took part in the successful massive Berber Revolt led by Maysara Amteghri in 739-742 against the Umayyad Arabs, and managed to wipe out the Umayyad Arab presence in Morocco and Algeria. The Berber principality Banu Midrar is named after Abul-Qasim Samku ibn Wasul, nicknamed Midrar, a Miknasa Berber who was said to take part in the Berber Revolt. The Miknasa adopted Kharijism-Islam and established the Emirate of Sijilmasa, under the Midrarid dynasty, on the northern edge of the Sahara in 757. This became very wealthy as the western end-point of the Trans-Saharan trade route with the Sudan. In alliance with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, it was able to fight off the attacks of the Fatimids. However, when the Miknasa chief Al-Mutazz allied himself with the Fatimids, the Miknasa were driven out of Sijilmasa by the Maghrawa, who were allies of the Umayyads.\n\nA further group of Miknasa were allied with the Fatimids against the Umayyads, and overthrew the Rustamids of Tahert in 912 and drove the Salihids from northern Morocco in 917. But they could not maintain their resistance to the Magrawa in northern Morocco permanently, and, weakened by the struggle, they were subdued by the Almoravids in the 11th century.\n\n"

    "title": "Open....",
    "text": "Open... was the trading name of Open Interactive Limited, which was a subsidiary of British Interactive Broadcasting. British Interactive Broadcasting was in turn owned by a consortium consisting of companies involving the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, British Telecom, Matsushita and BSkyB. Launching a few months late in August 1999, it only survived until the service was acquired and rebranded by BSkyB in October 2001, losing 116 million. The service was awarded a Design Council Millennium Product Award.\n\nFollowing disappointing revenues and a shift in marketing at Sky, BSkyB bought out the remaining shares of Open in May 2001 and the service was rebranded as \"Sky Active\".\n\nOpen was marketed as the flagship Interactive TV service on the then newly launched Sky Digital platform in the UK. Open was originally designed to house all of Sky Digital's interactive functions under the one name and in the one place.\n\nOpen had a state of the art fully refurbished head office in Farringdon Street, London where its own content was designed and built. The offices also housed their service control room and the services proxy servers (for when users digiboxes dialled to download and upload data). Transmission took place at the then BT Teleport site in North London.\n\nServices included Shopping, email, gaming, banking and information services like film guides or weather. The content was extensive and wide-ranging, however it was a \"walled garden\" as users could not go on the Internet or on traditional web pages. All content was specifically designed for use on Open and was not available on any other platform.\n\nDuring its short life, and despite Open processing 65 000 shopping transactions, it lost \u00a3116 million.\n\nAccess was available to all Sky Digital subscribers and could be accessed at any time by pressing the \"Interactive\" button on customer's Sky Digital remote control.\n\nOpen... was marketed as being available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for the customer's convenience. However, in reality, the service was unavailable for a number of minutes at quieter times (generally around 4 am each morning) when Open...'s proxy server software was being updated. This update meant that digiboxes could not connect online and left customers unable to make purchases or download weather forecasts etc...\n\nUsers could navigate through Open... using either the number keys or via the four coloured buttons typically on their Sky Digital remote control. Other buttons which were used included the \"back-up\" button to go back a screen or the directional arrows also on their Sky Digital remote control.\n\nAll screens regardless of who provided the content, displayed the Open... navigation banner. It was grey and semi-transparent and featured the four coloured buttons. The function of each coloured button varied, however the red button was always the \"go to\" menu. It allowed users to bookmark a particular screen, view their browsing history or \"go back\" a screen.\n\nOn entering the Open... platform, users were presented with the Top Level Menu homepage. This consisted of 7 or 8 numbered options (typically: shopping, banking, information, email and how to use) and a quarter screen video featuring traditional TV advertising (of the features available through Open...). As users navigated through the various menus, they could eventually enter Open... service provider portals such as WH Smith shop or Talk21 email.\n\nOpen... was divided up into five main zones or areas, these included:\n\n- Shopping\n- Banking\n- Information\n- Gaming\n- Personal\n\nRetailers such as Woolworths or The Gadget Shop were able to provide a small shop presence through Open... featuring their own branding, style and products. Typically because of the way Open... worked, users had to connect and allow their digibox to go online normally at a local rate number to download product information and in all cases, make a purchase through Open...\n\nIceland were originally the flagship Interactive store but despite extensive advertising - never actually launched.\n\nThe three main banks to feature a presence on Open... were HSBC (then Midland Bank), Halifax and The Woolwich. however HSBC were the only bank to actually provide a true online banking experience. Halifax and The Woolwich only provided information pages on their range of products and services.\n\nOpen... provided various information screens such as news and sports coverage from Sky News and Sky Sports, weather forecasts, showbiz (through the \"Hello\" portal) as well as cinema listings and travel guides. Open... also featured a Going Places travel agent outlook, but again this was just for information. No holidays could be purchased via Open...\n\nGaming was exceptionally popular with younger Open... users. Games were generally available over the satellite transmission and as such did not require the user to go online to download game data (except when submitting high scores).\n\nOriginal games included Beehive Bedlam, Fathom, Big Top Drop, Sheep Dip, Marvin Mole, King Tutti, Bumble Tumble, and Corporal Cluck. Marvin Mole Level 5 was completed blindfolded by Daniel Shah, in over 1000 moves.\n\nBeehive Bedlam was the only game which was still available through the Sky Games portal until its closure in January 2015. Although viewers didn't actually notice a different apart from the Sky Games branding; the game had been totally rebuilt from scratch since Open... first launched.\n\nOpen... provided (through BT) a Talk 21 email portal. Through the Digiboxes' online connection, users could register, send and receive email through the BT Talk 21 service.\n\nAll emails (regardless of encoding) were seen and sent as plain text. Attachments could not be read or attached. When the service was first launched, it was expected to use the @open-talk.co.uk domain, however as BT were a major shareholder, it was felt better to use the BT Talk 21 email brand.\n\nAnother Open... service was the Open Organiser. It allowed users to create personal profiles and store their credit card details for use throughout the whole Open... platform. Rather than have to type in your name, address and credit card number in every time you wanted to purchase something through Open..., you could opt to select your profile from the Organiser screen and use those stored details. The Organiser portal required an online connection at all times in order to work.\n\nOpen... faced many critics and criticisms, some of which are listed below:\n\n1. Open was extremely slow compared with the Internet. When users transitioned between zones or service providers - they faced around a 30-second wait for the next application to download\n\n2. Online connections - to send any data to Open..., users were required to allow their digiboxes to go online normally at a local or national rate phone number\n\n3. Users could not watch Sky TV and use Open... at the same time\n\n4. Being a \"walled garden\" service providers had to lease a certain amount of capacity on the platform. With this in mind, online shops normally featured an extremely limited selection of products.\n\n5. A number of service providers were heavily advertised such as Iceland (food store) and E*Trade bank. However these providers never actually launched a service on the platform.\n\n"

    "text": "Nonviolent Peaceforce (NP) is a nonpartisan unarmed peacekeeping organization with the goal of protecting civilians and reducing violence in areas affected by armed conflict. NP holds Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, and has been endorsed by nine Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including the Dalai Lama and former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. In 2016, Nonviolent Peaceforce was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe organization was founded by David Ray Hartsough, a US Quaker and civil rights activist, and Mel Duncan, former US member of the Nicaragua coffee/cotton brigades during the Contra war of 1984. The organization, first prompted by a 1999 citizens' conference in The Hague, was founded in New Delhi in 2002.\n\nMel Duncan served as Executive Director until 2009, in Minneapolis, MN. The central office moved to Brussels, Belgium in 2010 under Executive Director Tim Wallis, while retaining its U.S. operations in Minneapolis, near the Loring Park neighborhood. The organization was led by Doris Mariani until 31 May 2016, when Executive Director Tiffany Easthom took over. The organization has central offices in St. Paul, MN, and Brussels, Belgium. It is registered in the US as a 501(c)(3) organization and in Belgium as an AISBL.\n\nThe pilot project of NP was started in 2003 in Sri Lanka. Nonviolent Peaceforce peacekeepers were at work there between 2003 and 2008 but they could not stop the war that reoccurred in 2008 and came to an end only when the SLA defeated LTEE in May 2009. After 2009, NP continued work in the country for two years, mainly on child protection, helping to integrate former child soldiers back into everyday life, and working with local communities to bolster their own self-protection capabilities. In 2011, NP officially closed its mission in Sri Lanka.\n\nNP had a short-term engagement in Guatemala in 2007. Nonviolent Peaceforce had been invited by the Unidad de Protecci\u00f3n a Defensoras y Defensores de Derechos Humanos (UDEFEGUA), the Protection Unit for Human Rights Defenders. During the presidential elections taking place in September and November 2007, violence increased and human rights defenders were threatened; a small team of four members focused on accompanying the human rights defenders or being present in their office day and night. NP's work there allowed human rights defenders to function in a hostile climate, and they left shortly after elections were finished.\n\nAfter an exploratory mission in the region, NP deployed its team to the South Caucasus in 2012. There they worked along the Administrative Boundary Line between Georgian Tbilisi-Administered-Territories and de facto South Ossetia on civilian protection capacities in the region while canvassing to determine other places in the area that might benefit from unarmed civilian protection. NP left the area in 2014.\n\nAfter many rounds of exploration missions in the country, Nonviolent Peaceforce was invited to Ukraine in March 2015 to conduct trainings on unarmed civilian protection for civil society groups and the communities they serve. This was conducted with the Association for Middle Eastern Studies and was the first time UCP had been introduced in Ukraine.\n\nNonviolent Peaceforce started working in Cox's Bazar, the world\u2019s largest refugee camp located in Bangladesh in 2018.\u00a0 As the refugee crisis unfolds, and overwhelming humanitarian needs emerge, the NP team is working with local partners to improve the safety of people living in the camp and to prepare for the flooding and mudslides of the rainy season. NP is building collaborative relationships with local non-governmental organizations, internal Rohingya-led organizations, and international non-governmental organizations and is providing protection to these organizations responsible for overseeing the camp.\n\nNonviolent Peaceforce's activity in the Middle East began in 2012 with a joint training with the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and Responsibility to Protect for activists in civil society in Lebanon and Syria. The seminar was part of an initiative by the UN in response to increasing polarization in the area.\n\nIn Mindanao, Philippines a ceasefire was the starting point for the invitation of NP by local peace organizations (e.g. Mindanao peoples Caucus and Consortium of Bangsamoro Civil Society). After a short time, NP Philippines was part of the International Monitoring Team (IMT) to oversee the ceasefire agreement between the Philippine Army and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a guerilla organization that sought independence and later self-determination for the southern island of Mindanao. NP is responsible for the Civilian Protection Component which had its antecedents (and still relies on) the Independent Fact-Finding Committee and Bantay Ceasefire.\n\nAn impact evaluation done in May 2014 found that citizens in Mindanao felt safer due to Nonviolent Peaceforce\u2019s presence and their role as part of the CPC for IMT.\n\nAfter the cancellation of a proposed project in Uganda, the peace agreement between Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Army as well as the planned independence referendum in South Sudan in January 2011 provided a starting point for exploring and later implementing a project in Sudan/South Sudan.\n\nTwo Sudanese organizations, the Institute for the Promotion of Civil Society (IPCS) and the Sudanese Organization for Nonviolence and Development (SONAD), invited NP to assist in preventing violence before and during the forthcoming elections and referendum. The more general task, also for the time after the referendum, was to build up local expertise for preventing and mediating in inter-ethnic conflicts in the region. The assignment was led by a Sri Lankan peacekeeper who was responsible for the protection of children in Sri Lanka. In South Sudan, UNICEF financed a similar project specifically for Ugandan child soldiers who were recruited by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The field offices have since been extended to ten teams.\n\nMuch of Nonviolent Peaceforce\u2019s work in South Sudan focuses on child protection and women\u2019s protection. They have successfully trained many women on the ground to form \u201cWomen\u2019s Peacekeeping Teams\u201d (WPTs) in order to reduce gender-based violence on the ground. WPTs have also been cited as empowering women on the ground in South Sudan while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of protecting women and children.\n\nOn 8 March 2016, Nonviolent Peaceforce launched an $8 million project on \"Promoting Women's Role in Peacebuilding and Gender-Based Violence Prevention in South Sudan\". The funding for the project came from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and will be functionally funded through the Dutch Embassy in South Sudan.\n\nIn 2012, Nonviolent Peaceforce received an official invitation from the Government of Myanmar. One of the main tasks NP has there is to monitor ceasefires and to set up mechanisms by which civilians can monitor them. They hold trainings across the country for these purposes. NP is also supporting women's organizations on the ground, aiding them in taking a more prominent role in guiding decision-making at the local level.\n\nNonviolent Peaceforce began work in Iraq in February 2017, establishing an office in Erbil, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and deploying staff to facilitate the start-up of a country programme. NP initially focused on the provision of frontline protection services to internally displaced persons (IDP) along the displacement corridors during the military offensives to retake ISIS-controlled areas. Since the end of major combat operations against ISIS, NP has refocused efforts on vulnerable IDPs in camps, returnees in contested and high-risk areas, tensions along the disputed Federal Iraq and KRI border, and arbitrary detentions.\n\nThe work of NP consists of three pillars: projects in conflict areas; lobbying, especially within United Nations as well as European Commission and European Parliament; training. The organizational and administrative day-to-day duties are carried out by the secretariat- headed by the Executive Director. The programmatic work (on projects, explorations, budget and policies) is the task of the international board called International Governing Council (IGC).\n\nTogether with its founder Mel Duncan, the organization in 2007 received the International Pfeffer Peace Award from the Fellowship of Reconciliation. The Luxembourg Peace Prize was awarded to the organization in 2018.\n\n"

    "title": "T95 Medium Tank",
    "text": "The T95 was an American prototype medium tank developed from 1955 to 1959. These tanks used many advanced or unusual features, such as siliceous-cored armor, a new transmission, and the OPTAR fire-control system. The OPTAR incorporated an electro-optical rangefinder and was mounted on the right side of the turret, and was used in conjunction with the APFSDS-firing 90\u00a0mm T208 smoothbore gun, which had a rigid mount without a recoil system. In addition, although the tanks were designed with a torsion beam suspension, a hydropneumatic suspension was fitted, and one of the tanks was fitted with a Solar Saturn gas turbine for demonstration purposes.\n\nThe siliceous cored armor consisted of fused silica, which has a mass efficiency of approximately three versus copper-lined shaped charges, embedded in cast steel armor for an overall mass efficiency of 1.4. The early APFSDS penetrators fired by the T208 had a low length-to-diameter ratio, this being limited by their brittle tungsten carbide construction, with a diameter of 37\u00a0mm, although they had a high muzzle velocity of . The rangefinder, the \"T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging\" (OPTAR) system, emitted pulsed beams of intense but incoherent infrared light. These incoherent beams scattered easily, reducing effectiveness in mist and rain and causing multiple returns, requiring the gunner to identify the correct return after estimating the range by sight. This, combined with the large and vulnerable design of the transmitter and receiver assembly, led to the abandonment of the OPTAR system in 1957.\n\nIn the early 1950s, work began in the US to develop an eventual replacement to the M48 tank, the operational medium tank at the time. A series of relatively simple upgrades to the T48 were considered as part of the T54 project, but these were considered to offer too little advantage to be worth it. Examples of more radical upgrades were also called for. In September 1954, out of many submitted plans, two main examples were chosen \u2013 one of them, the T95; the other, the T96, which used a heavier gun and a 105\u00a0mm round. Both tanks used smooth-bore barrels with a fixed mount and no recoil system. In November 1956, it was finally decided that nine tanks would be produced. Four of them would be original T95s. One would be a T95 with a 90\u00a0mm gun on a mount with a recoil system, receiving the designation T95E1. The remaining four would use the T95 chassis and the T96 turret, and were designated the T95E4.\n\nBecause the T96 turrets were not yet constructed (and were never completed), it was decided that of the four T95E4s, two would be fitted with the M48A2 turret, and the other two were fitted with T54E2 turret and with 105-mm T140 cannon.\n\nThe first T95 variant to go into production was the T95E2, in May 1957. The T95E3 was produced in July of the same year, and the first original T95s were ready in February 1958.\n\nThe T95 tank was created using a traditional design with a driver in the front, the fighting compartment in the center, and the engine compartment in the rear. The tank had a four-man crew, consisting of a commander, a gunner, a loader, and a driver.\n\nThe driver\u2019s work area is in the forward compartment. The driver's hatch is located in the glacis above his head. With the hatch sealed the driver operates using three periscopic visual devices, the middle of which is equipped with a night-vision infrared camera from the T161. Ammunition stores are located on either side of the driver\u2019s chair.\n\nThe majority of the hull is welded, but the front is a single massive casting. The upper part of the forward armor, or glacis, has a thickness of 95\u00a0mm and is at an angle of 65 degrees from vertical. The thickness of the roof and floor of the hull around the driver's compartment is 51 and 19\u00a0mm respectively; the thicknesses of said areas are 25 and 13\u00a0mm, respectively, around the fighting and engine compartments. The thickness of the main side plates vary from 102\u00a0mm up front down to 32\u00a0mm around the engine.\n\nThe cast turret has a ring diameter of 85\u00a0inches (the same as the M48). The frontal turret armor is 178\u00a0mm, and the sides are 78\u00a0mm. The shape of the turret is elongated compared to the M48. The gunner\u2019s seat is situated to the right of the main gun in the front of the turret. The commander\u2019s seat is also in the turret with a built-in 12.7 mm M2 machine gun, with an M28 periscopic sight for aiming. For 360-degree vision, 5 armored viewports are installed in the turret. Primary shells are stored in the lower section of the turret, beneath the ring.\n\nThe T95 and the T95E1 are equipped with a T208 90\u00a0mm smooth-bore gun. The T95 equipment was installed on a fixed mount and was stabilized in two axes. The T95E1 equipment was installed on a recoil mount, but lacked stabilization systems. All T95 models were equipped with T320 armor-piercing rounds, which had a tungsten core, a diameter of 40\u00a0mm, and a muzzle velocity of 1520 meters per second. These rounds could successfully penetrate a 127\u00a0mm armor plate when fired at a 60-degree angle from 2000 yards. A standard T95 was equipped with 50 rounds.\n\nThe T95E2 retained the armament of its predecessor, the M48A2. With a 90\u00a0mm gun, it could fire a 74\u00a0mm anti-armor shell at 915 meters per second for a range of 2000 yards. It was equipped with 64 rounds.\n\nThe T95E3 was armed with a T140 105\u00a0mm rifled gun. With a muzzle velocity of 1079\u00a0m/s, the armor piecing capability at 2000 yards is 122\u00a0mm at a 60-degree firing angle. Standard equipment was 64 rounds.\n\nThe T95E4 was planned to have a T210 105\u00a0mm smoothbore gun. In order to accommodate the extra length of the rounds (112\u00a0cm), the gun was moved forward, preventing stabilization. The muzzle velocity of the round was 1740\u00a0m/s, with an armor penetration of 152\u00a0mm at 60 degrees at 2000 yards Standard equipment was 40 rounds.\n\nWith the appearance of the T123 120\u00a0mm rifled gun, it was decided that it should be installed on two of the four planned T95E4s. This variant was designated T95E6. The T123 gun had a muzzle velocity of 1070\u00a0m/s and armor-piercing capability of 122\u00a0mm at 60 degrees, at a range of 2000 yards.\n\nThe T95E2 and the T95E3 were equipped with a fire-control system, identical to the one used in the M48A2, with a stereoscopic rangefinder and a mechanical ballistics computer.\n\nThe T95 also had an FCS which had an OPTAR optic rangefinder, as well as an electronic ballistics computer. It also featured a periscopic sight from the T44 and a T50 ballistic computer.\n\nThe T95E1 used a simplified targeting system \u2013 a rangefinder and a ballistics computer were omitted.\n\nUnder the original proposal, T95 and T96 tanks had to be equipped with an X-shaped 750\u00a0hp 12-cylinder diesel engine. However, because this engine was only in the early stages of development, it was decided to temporarily equip the tanks with a 4-stroke, 8-cylinder AOI-1195 gasoline engine. The engine was placed transversely and was connected with the XTG-410 four-speed transmission. Three fuel tanks, with a total capacity of 780 liters, were installed in the engine compartment.\n\nDespite higher fuel economy compared to the M48A2 engine, gasoline engines provided insufficient torque. At the same time, the development of the X-shaped diesel engine failed, so starting in mid-1958, other options were considered. As an interim measure, they decided to use a modified version of the civilian 12-cylinder, two-stroke, water-cooled, V-type, 570\u00a0hp GM 12V71T diesel engine.\n\nA contract was signed with the Continental Motors Company in the development of the AVDS-1100 air-cooled diesel engine, and with Caterpillar to develop the LVDS-1100 water-cooled diesel engine. Both engines are quad-V-shaped, with an estimated 550\u00a0hp. However, tank testing with the three new power plants began after the retirement of the T95 program.\n\nThe suspension consists of five sets of double road wheels with torsion bar springs. The system does not have track return rollers. The forward and rearmost road wheels are equipped with hydraulic shock absorbers. On some of the tanks lightweight openwork road wheels were used.\n\nCaterpillar treads were used, with rubber bushed pins. The width of the tracks were 533\u00a0mm or 610\u00a0mm. The number of tracks in a tread was 80 and the length of the bearing surface was 4.2 m.\n\nDuring the development of T95 tank, it became clear that it would not have a significant advantage over the M48A2. The X-shaped motor and optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototype of the M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Brzeg Dolny",
    "text": "Brzeg Dolny () is a town in Wo\u0142\u00f3w County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship in south-western Poland. It is located north-west of Wroc\u0142aw on the Oder River, and is the site of a large chemical plant complex, PCC Rokita SA. , the town's population was 12,511.\n\nThe oldest Slavic settlements in present-day Brzeg Dolny date back to the early Middle Ages. In the 10th century the area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I of Poland. Brzeg Dolny was first mentioned under the Old Polish name \"Brzege\" in a 1353 deed as a part of the Duchy of Wroc\u0142aw, then within the Bohemian (Czech) Crown Lands. The Warzy\u0144 district is older, mentioned as a village in a 1261 document of Duke Henry III the White when the region was still part of medieval Piast-ruled Poland. There was a ferry crossing the Oder River in Brzeg Dolny.\n\nIn 1660, it was bought by the Austrian chancellor Baron George Abraham von Dyhrn (1620\u20131671) of the Dyhrn family. In 1663, it was officially renamed from its Polish name to \"Dyhernfurth\", after the Dyhrn family, and was granted town privileges by Emperor Leopold I of Habsburg. The baron made efforts to expand the new town, opening a Catholic school for boys and building a chapel under the patronage of St. Hedwig. The year 1668 saw the construction of a wooden pipe to draw water directly from the river into town.\n\nJews also settled in Brzeg Dolny in the 17th century. Their arrival was connected to the printing house of Shabbatai Bass; the press personnel consisted of Polish and Czech Jews from Prague, Cracow and Wodzis\u0142aw. By 1694 the number of the printing house personnel consisted of 48 people in 13 Jewish families. From 1772 onward Bass\u2019 printing house published the \"Dyhernfurther Privilegierte Zeitung\", which was written in the German language but printed using the Hebrew alphabet. \n\nThe Dyhrns had built a palace for their residence, which stayed in their possession until the early 1780s, when Count Wilhelm von Dyhrn (1749\u20131813) sold it to the minister of Silesia Karl Georg von Hoym (1739-1807), who had married Baroness Antoinette Louise von Dyhrn und Sch\u00f6nau (1745\u20131820). The new owners subsequently modernized the Baroque palace and the adjoining park according to the plans of Carl Gotthard Langhans. Langhans also directed the construction of a large neo-classical pavilion perpendicular to the central structure, which became known as the \u201cLittle Palace.\u201d Following these changes, the grand complex remained much the same until 1849, when it passed into the hands of Tony von Lazareff. She had it refashioned to resemble a Renaissance ch\u00e2teau overlooking the Loire. The river bank garden was also given Renaissance character.\n\nIn 1742, after the First Silesian War, the duchy became part of Prussia and remained in Prusso-German possession until 1945.\n\nIn 1860, the first sisters of Charity of St. Charles Borromeo came to Dyhernfurth. In close proximity to the Chapel of St. Hedwig, the nuns established a small convent and a hospital, which would eventually expand into the town hospital of present day.\n\nIn 1834 the printing house published its last book. After it formally closed in 1840, the Jewish community rapidly diminished as printers went elsewhere for work; by 1885 there were only 35 Jews left in the town. In 1927 the synagogue was transformed into a fire station, in 1936 the last burial was performed at the Jewish cemetery, and in November 1938, the cemetery was demolished.\n\nDuring World War II, as part of the \"Gr\u00fcn 3\" program, a plant for the manufacture of the nerve agent tabun was established in Dyhernfurth, producing the nerve agent under the codename \"Trilon-83\". Run by the \"Anorgana GmbH\", a branch of IG Farben, the plant began production in 1942. The Germans utilized the forced labour of prisoners of Nazi concentration camps to produce the chemical weapons. Two subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp \u2013 Dyhernfurth I and Dyhernfurth II \u2013 were established for this purpose. While the Dyhernfurth I inmates were forced to produce the gas and fill bombs and shells with it, the prisoners of the second camp were primarily forced to work on enlarging the plant.\nThe plant initially produced shells and aerial bombs using a 95:5 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene, designated \"Variant A\" before switching in the latter half of the war to \"Variant B,\" an 80:20 mix of tabun and chlorobenzene designed to make the mixture disperse more easily. Large scale manufacturing of the agent resulted in problems with the product's degradation over time and only around 12,500 tons of material were manufactured before the plant was overrun by the advancing Soviet forces.\n\nThe Soviets, however, did not capture any tabun at Dyhernfurth. Although they occupied the area of the factory, a German raid was organized by Generalmajor Max Sachsenheimer. A German unit with roughly the strength of a battalion crossed the Oder River early on February 5, 1945, seized the factory, and deployed an anti-tank screen. On that day, the Germans destroyed documentation and evidence of the camp's atrocities and pumped tabun into the Oder River, while the screening force resisted two small-scale Soviet counter-attacks. In the evening of February 5, the German force pulled back behind the Oder River. Subsequently, the Soviet government had the plant dismantled and taken back to Russia.\n\nIn January 1945, as the Soviets launched their massive offensive into eastern Germany, Count Thassilo von Saurma-Hoym, a descendant of Karl Georg von Hoym, left the Dyhernfurth palace along with his family and fled westward. In February, the palace was set on fire, probably by Soviet soldiers. When the town was handed over to Poland, its German population was expelled, in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. It was repopulated by Poles, expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, particularly from Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w and Sniatyn.\n\nAfter the war the original Polish name \"Brzeg\" was restored, and the adjective \"Dolny\" was added to distinguish it from the more populous town of Brzeg.\n\nConsiderable effort was required to adapt the contaminated and badly damaged factory buildings to production. It was not until 1946 that the plant started producing Sodium hypochlorite. The new plant was named \"Rokita\" in June 1947.\n\nThe historic palace was rebuilt in the 1950s, albeit with its shape altered. The adjoining pavilion has, however, managed to survive unchanged. Today, the complex functions as a cultural center and the seat of municipal government.\n\nA new bridge over the Oder river was built in 2013.\n\nBrzeg Dolny is divided into three main residential neighbourhoods: Stary Brzeg (the Old Brzeg Dolny) by the bank of the Oder, Osiedle Warzy\u0144 to the west, and Osiedle Fabryczne to the north-east. The Rokita Chemical Plant stretches east of the town. In the center of Brzeg Dolny is a large (67 hectare) Park Miejski formerly part of the palace complex.\n\nThe palace faces the southern side of the park, to which it connects via a short walkway (\"Al. Pa\u0142acowa\") leading directly to the largest of the three ponds found within the park. On the park's west side, at \"Aleje Jerozolimskie\" (one of the town's main streets), stands the Chapel of St. Hedwig, just north of which is the Convent of the Sisters of Charity of St. Charles Borromeo. Extending north from the convent (to which it is connected) is the town hospital; north of it, in turn, and still along \"Aleje Jerozolimskie\" is a large clinic (\"Przychodnia Rejonowo-Specjalistyczna\"). The town has two additional clinics (in \"Osiedle Warzy\u0144\" and \"Osiedle Fabryczne\") and a medical center (in \"Osiedle Warzy\u0144\"). In \"Osiedle Warzy\u0144\" can be found the KHS complex, which features a hotel and a variety of athletic facilities, including swimming pools and tennis courts. Through the town - between \"Osiedle Warzy\u0144\" and \"Osiedle Fabryczne\" - runs a railway, with a (PKP) train station located on the eastern side of the park toward the south and \"Stary Brzeg\".\n\nBrzeg Dolny has three Roman Catholic parishes: the Parish of Our Lady of the Scapular (\"Parafia Matki Bo\u017cej Szkaplerznej\"), the Parish of Christ the King (\"Parafia Chrystusa Kr\u00f3la\"), and the Parish of Our Lady Queen of Poland (\"Parafia Matki Bo\u017cej Kr\u00f3lowej Polski\"). In addition to two historic churches and chapels, there are two modern parish churches in the town.\n\nSee twin towns of Gmina Brzeg Dolny.\n\n\n"

The district is the largest in Licking County, with nearly 7,000 students.\n\nThe district was formed in 1848 after the passage of a voter petition to unify the schools in Newark under one system. The first school board was elected on September 19, 1849. A \"Negro school\" operated from 1859 until 1888 to provide segregated education to African American children in the Newark district.\n\nAt the request of the U.S. government in 1940, the district initiated industrial training programs that were intended to assist in national defense. The shops operated 24 hours a day, six days a week, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, became directly funded by the government to expand into a second building and thirty-five classes. It has been estimated that the district trained 8,000 people between 1940 and 1945 with skills essential to the national defense industries.\n\n, three additional elementary schools and two middle schools are slated to begin construction.\n\nIn mid-2005 Newark City Schools began to phase out its former system of schooling. Under the former system, grades K-4th went to elementary school, grades 5th-6th went to intermediate school, 7th-8th went to middle school, and grades 9th-12th went to High School. Under the reformed system of schooling, grades K-5 go to elementary school, 6-8 goes to middle school, and 9-12 goes to high school. Former intermediate schools include Central Intermediate and West Main Intermediate. Central is now a private school and West Main is a vacant facility.\n\nThe elementary schools include Carson, Cherry Valley, Hillview, and Legend Elementary Schools. The middle schools are Heritage (replaced Lincoln), Liberty Middle School and Wilson Middle School.\n\nThe district's Board of Education consists of five citizens elected to staggered four-year terms, with one president, one vice-president, and three members. In addition to the general goal of educating the district's students, the Board has the specific duties of hiring the district's superintendent and treasurer, overseeing the annual budget, and approving contracts with district employees. Board meetings are open to the public and held in the high school library.\n\nThe superintendent is directly responsible to the district Board of Education, and implements board policies. He administers the district's educational programs and has final responsibility for curriculum, staffing, and evaluation. All district employees are responsible to the superintendent, except for the treasurer, who is also a direct employee of the board. In cooperation with the superintendent, the treasurer manages the district's financial, legal and contractual affairs.\n\n\n\nGrades K-12. An online, state-accredited distance learning program.\n\nGrades 9-12. Average enrollment is approximately 1700 students; an additional 150 students attend the Career Technical Education Center (C-TEC) associated with the school. The staff is around 190.

He also scored 121 goals in the Polish Ekstraklasa (11th most in history) and was the top league goalscorer twice. He also played in Scotland, Greece and Cyprus.\n\nBorn in Pozna\u0144, Poland, \u017burawski made his debut for Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w in Ekstraklasa on 2 November 1999 in a match against \u0141KS \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. On 4 March 2000 he scored his first goal for Wisla in the Ekstraklasa in a match against Odra Wodzis\u0142aw. He won the Ekstraklasa championship in 2000\u201301 season with Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w. In 2001\u201302 season, \u017burawski scored 21 goals in 27 matches and was the Ekstraklasa Top Goalscorer. In 2002\u201303 season \u017burawski played very well in UEFA Cup, where he scored 10 goals in 10 matches, including 7 goals in matches against Parma F.C., FC Schalke 04 and S.S. Lazio. When Kamil Kosowski left Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w, \u017burawski has been chosen new Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w captain. In 2003\u201304 season \u017burawski scored 20 goals in 26 matches and led Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w to achieve the Ekstraklasa title. He was the Ekstraklasa Top Goalscorer in 2003\u201304 season. In 2004\u201305 he won his fourth Ekstraklasa title with Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w. In this season he scored 24 goals in 25 matches for Wis\u0142a in Ekstraklasa.\n\nHe joined Scottish Premier League side Celtic from Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w in July 2005 and signed a three-year contract. He inherited the number 7 shirt from Juninho Paulista (previously with Henrik Larsson), and was nicknamed \"Magic \u017burawski\" by the fans.\n\nOn 19 February 2006, \u017burawski scored four goals as Celtic set a new SPL record by beating Dunfermline Athletic 8\u20131 at East End Park. \u017burawski was subsequently voted the \"SPL Player of the Month\" for February. Zurawski finished Celtic's joint top scorer in the 2005\u201306 season along with John Hartson with 20 goals each.\n\nFor the 2006\u201307 season, Celtic signed strikers Kenny Miller and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink as replacements for Hartson and Dion Dublin. \u017burawski formed decent strike partnerships with both players. Having made a good start to the season, notching up 10 goals by January 2007, \u017burawski then suffered an injury that kept him out for most of the season and scored no further goals during the campaign.\nChris Killen and Scott McDonald were signed before the start of season 2007\u201308. \u017burawski started Celtic's opening day clash with Kilmarnock at Celtic Park, but fell down the pecking order after McDonald returned from suspension and Killen came back from injury. The only other impact \u017burawski made during the season was scoring the winning penalty in a Champions League penalty shootout against FC Spartak Moskow. His time at Celtic was ultimately over after the signing of Georgios Samaras in January 2008.\n\nOn the deadline day of the 2008 winter transfer window he was signed by the Greek side A.E. Larissa for \u00a3500,000. He scored a goal in his Greek league debut, the only goal of the game to defeat AEK Athens F.C. 1\u20130.\n\u017burawski was Larissa's top scorer for 2008\u201309 season with 9 goals.\n\nOn 2 June 2009, it was announced that \u017burawski had signed for Cypriot League runners-up Omonia Nicosia. He played for Omonia for one year and helped the team to return to titles after five years. He was released in May 2010.\n\nOn 30 June 2010, \u017burawski returned to Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w after five years, on a one-year deal. In the 2010\u201311 season he won his fifth Ekstraklasa title with Wis\u0142a.\n\n\u017burawski was selected in the 23-man Polish squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup finals in South Korea & Japan. He played in all three of the team's games and missed a penalty in the match against the United States, although Poland won 3\u20131.\n\nHe was selected in the 23-man Polish squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals in Germany. His side finished third in the group and were eliminated at the first hurdle, losing to hosts Germany and a determined Ecuador before defeating Costa Rica. Zurawski did not score in any of the three matches.\n\nZurawski was named as Captain in Poland's Euro 2008 squad, starting their first game against Germany on 8 June but later got injured and was substituted at half time. This injury meant that he would miss the rest of the tournament and the captaincy was given to Jacek B\u0105k and Micha\u0142 \u017bew\u0142akow for the second and third group stage matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "We're Not Happy 'til You're Not Happy is the fifth studio album by ska punk band, Reel Big Fish. It was released on April 5, 2005 on Mojo Records to mixed reviews.\n\nNotably darker than the band's previous album, \"Cheer Up!\", the album's songs commonly express jealousy, regret, short-lasting fame, and disappointment toward mainstream record companies.\nThe album also includes covers of Tracy Chapman's \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\", Morrissey's \"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\" and Social Distortion's \"Story of My Life\". Both the Chapman cover and the Social Distortion cover were respectively chosen as the first and second singles.\n\nThe album was not particularly successful in comparison to previous releases. The band felt a large portion of this was on the record company's lack of promotion. This, amongst a long list of other conflicts, led to the band's 2006 split with Jive Records.\n\nAfter the track \"Your Guts (I Hate 'Em)\", a long period of random sounds and loud noises plays. These noises include screaming, short excerpts from a song sung by Scott Klopfenstein and a hidden message played backwards on repeat, read by singer Aaron Barrett. The message says:\n\nFrom here the message repeats.\n\nAllMusic described the album's songs as \"angry\" and \"embittered\", but also deemed the album as \"super catchy\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "The fifth and final season of the \"Sailor Moon\" anime series, titled , was directed by Takuya Igarashi and produced by Toei Animation. Like the rest of the \"Sailor Moon\" series, it follows the adventures of Usagi Tsukino and her fellow Sailor Guardians. The series is divided into two story arcs. The first 6 episodes consist of a self-contained arc in which the Sailor Guardians encounter Queen Nehelenia again. The remaining 28 episodes adapt material from the \"Stars\" act of the \"Sailor Moon\" manga series by Naoko Takeuchi, in which the Sailor Guardians meet up with the Sailor Starlights, led by Princess Kakyuu. They discover that Sailor Galaxia, the leader of the \"Shadow Galactica\" organization and a corrupted Sailor Guardian, plans to increase her powers and rule the Milky Way.\n\nThe season began broadcasting on TV Asahi on March 9, 1996 and ended on February 8, 1997 for 34 episodes. It was later released on DVD in six compilations with five episodes, by Toei, from September 26 to November 21, 2005. In May 2014, Viz Media announced that they licensed the series from the start for an uncut release, and also that they plan to release the fifth season on Blu-ray and DVD. On December 14, 2015, Viz Media streamed the first episode of \"Sailor Moon Sailor Stars\", along with the series finale of \"Sailor Moon SuperS\", on Hulu in the United States, followed by a streaming release of the entire show on Tubi TV in Canada on July 15, 2016. The first 17 episodes of \"Sailor Stars\" were released in a dual-language format on June 18, 2019. The rest were released on November 12, 2019.\n\nThree pieces of theme music were used: one opening theme and two ending themes. The opening theme, titled \"Sailor Star Song\", is performed by Kae Hanazawa. The ending theme, used for the first 33 episodes, is \"Kaze mo Sora mo Kitto...\" performed by Alisa Mizuki. The second and final ending theme is \"Moonlight Densetsu\" performed by Moon Lips.\n\nBandai released two video games in 1996 to promote this season: \"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Sailor Stars\" for Sega Pico, and \"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Sailor Stars: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2\" for Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n<onlyinclude>\n\n</onlyinclude>\n"

    "title": "Reptiliomorpha",
    "text": "Reptiliomorpha is a clade containing the amniotes and those tetrapods that share a more recent common ancestor with amniotes than with living amphibians (lissamphibians). It was defined by Michel Laurin (2001) and Vallin and Laurin (2004) as the largest clade that includes \"Homo sapiens\", but not \"Ascaphus truei\" (tailed frog).\n\nThe informal variant of the name, \"reptiliomorphs\", is also occasionally used to refer to stem-amniotes, i.e. a grade of reptile-like tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to lissamphibians, but are not amniotes themselves; the name is used in this meaning e.g. by Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003). An alternative name, \"Anthracosauria\", is also commonly used for the group, but is confusingly also used for a more primitive grade of reptiliomorphs (Embolomeri) by Benton.\n\nAs the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda remains uncertain, it also remains controversial which fossil tetrapods are more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians, and thus, which ones of them were reptiliomorphs in any meaning of the word. The two major hypotheses for lissamphibian origins are that they are either descendants of dissorophoid temnospondyls or microsaurian \"lepospondyls\". If the former (the \"temnospondyl hypothesis\") is true, then Reptiliomorpha includes all tetrapod groups that are closer to amniotes than to temnospondyls. These include the diadectomorphs, seymouriamorphs, most or all \"lepospondyls\", gephyrostegids, and possibly the embolomeres and chroniosuchians. In addition, several \"anthracosaur\" genera of uncertain taxonomic placement would also probably qualify as reptiliomorphs, including \"Solenodonsaurus\", \"Eldeceeon\", \"Silvanerpeton\", and \"Casineria\". However, if lissamphibians originated among the lepospondyls according to the \"lepospondyl hypothesis\", then Reptiliomorpha refers to groups that are closer to amniotes than to lepospondyls. Few non-amniote groups would count as reptiliomorphs under this definition, although the diadectomorphs are among those that qualify.\n\nThe name Reptiliomorpha was coined by Professor Gunnar S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh in 1934 to designate amniotes and various types of late Paleozoic tetrapods that were more closely related to amniotes than to living amphibians. In his view, the amphibians had evolved from fish twice, with one group composed of the ancestors of modern salamanders and the other, which S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh referred to as Eutetrapoda, consisting of anurans (frogs), amniotes, and their ancestors, with the origin of caecilians being uncertain. S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh's Eutetrapoda consisted of two sister-groups: Batrachomorpha, containing anurans and their ancestors, and Reptiliomorpha, containing anthracosaurs and amniotes. S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh subsequently added Seymouriamorpha to his Reptiliomorpha as well.\n\nAlfred Sherwood Romer rejected S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh's theory of a biphyletic amphibia and used the name Anthracosauria to describe the \"labyrinthodont\" lineage from which amniotes evolved. In 1970, the German paleontologist Alec Panchen took up S\u00e4ve-S\u00f6derbergh's name for this group as having priority, but Romer's terminology is still in use, e.g. by Carroll (1988 and 2002) and by Hildebrand & Goslow (2001). Some writers preferring phylogenetic nomenclature use Anthracosauria.\n\nIn 1956, Friedrich von Huene included both amphibians and anapsid reptiles in the Reptiliomorpha. This included the following orders: Anthracosauria, Seymouriamorpha, Microsauria, Diadectomorpha, Procolophonia, Pareiasauria, Captorhinidia, Testudinata.\n\nMichael Benton (2000, 2004) made it the sister-clade to Lepospondyli, containing \"anthracosaurs\" (in the strict sense, i.e. Embolomeri), seymouriamorphs, diadectomorphs and amniotes. Subsequently, Benton included lepospondyls in Reptiliomorpha as well. However, when considered in a Linnean framework, Reptiliomorpha is given the rank of superorder and includes only reptile-like amphibians, not their amniote descendants.\n\nSeveral phylogenetic studies indicate that amniotes and diadectomorphs share a more recent common ancestor with lepospondyls than with seymouriamorphs, \"Gephyrostegus\" and Embolomeri (e.g. Laurin and Reisz, 1997, 1999; Ruta, Coates and Quicke, 2003; Vallin and Laurin, 2004; Ruta and Coates, 2007). Lepospondyls are one of the groups of tetrapods suggested to be ancestors of living amphibians; as such, their potential close relationship to amniotes has important implications for the content of Reptiliomorpha. Assuming that lissamphibians aren't descended from lepospondyls but from a different group of tetrapods, e.g. from temnospondyls, it would mean that Lepospondyli belonged to Reptiliomorpha \"sensu\" Laurin (2001), as it would make them more closely related to amniotes than to lissamphibians. On the other hand, if lissamphibians are descended from lepospondyls, then not only Lepospondyli would have to be excluded from Reptiliomorpha, but seymouriamorphs, \"Gephyrostegus\" and Embolomeri would also have to be excluded from this group, as this would make them more distantly related to amniotes than living amphibians are. In that case, the clade Reptiliomorpha \"sensu\" Laurin would contain, apart from Amniota, only diadectomorphs and possibly also \"Solenodonsaurus\".\n\nGephyrostegids, seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs were land-based, reptile-like amphibians, while embolomeres were aquatic amphibians with long body and short limbs. Their anatomy falls between the mainly aquatic Devonian labyrinthodonts and the first reptiles. University of Bristol paleontologist Professor Michael J. Benton gives the following characteristics for the Reptiliomorpha (in which he includes embolomeres, seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs):\n\n\nThe groups traditionally assigned to Reptiliomorpha, i.e. embolomeres, seymouriamorphs and diadectomorphs, differed from their contemporaries, the non-reptiliomorph temnospondyls, in having a deeper and taller skull, but retained the primitive kinesis (loose attachment) between the skull roof and the cheek (with exception of some specialized taxa, such as \"Seymouria\", in which the cheek was solidly attached to the skull roof). The deeper skull allowed for laterally placed eyes, contrary to the dorsally placed eyes commonly found in amphibians. The skulls of the group are usually found with fine radiating grooves. The quadrate bone in the back of the skull held a deep otic notch, likely holding a spiracle rather than a tympanum.\n\nThe vertebrae showed the typical multi-element construction seen in labyrinthodonts. According to Benton, in the vertebrae of \"anthracosaurs\" (i.e. Embolomeri) the intercentrum and pleurocentrum may be of equal size, while in the vertebrae of seymouriamorphs the pleurocentrum is the dominant element and the intercentrum is reduced to a small wedge. The intercentrum gets further reduced in the vertebrae of amniotes, where it becomes a thin plate or disappears altogether. Unlike most labyrinthodonts, the body was moderately deep rather than flat, and the limbs were well-developed and ossified, indicating a predominantly terrestrial lifestyle except in secondarily aquatic groups. Each foot held 5 digits, the pattern seen in their amniote descendants. They did, however, lack the reptilian type of ankle bone that would have allowed the use of the feet as levers for propulsion rather than as holdfasts.\n\nThe general build was heavy in all forms, though otherwise very similar to that of early reptiles. The skin, at least in the more advanced forms probably had a water-tight epidermal horny overlay, similar to the one seen in today's reptiles, though they lacked horny claws. In chroniosuchians and some seymouriamorphs, like \"Discosauriscus\", dermal scales are found in post-metamorphic specimens, indicating they may have had a \"knobbly\", if not scaly, appearance.\n\nSeymouriamorphs reproduced in amphibian fashion with aquatic eggs that hatched into larvae (tadpoles) with external gills; it is unknown how other tetrapods traditionally assigned to Reptiliomorpha reproduced.\n\nDuring the Carboniferous and Permian periods, some tetrapods started to evolve towards a reptilian condition. Some of these tetrapods (e.g. \"Archeria\", \"Eogyrinus\") were elongate, eel-like aquatic forms with diminutive limbs, while others (e.g. \"Seymouria\", \"Solenodonsaurus\", \"Diadectes\", \"Limnoscelis\") were so reptile-like that until quite recently they actually had been considered to be true reptiles, and it is likely that to a modern observer they would have appeared as large to medium-sized, heavy-set lizards. Several groups however remained aquatic or semiaquatic. Some of the chroniosuchians show the build and presumably habits of modern crocodiles and were probably also similar to crocodylians in that they were river-side predators. While some other Chroniosuchians possessed elongated newt- or eel-like bodies. The two most terrestrially adapted groups were the medium-sized insectivorous or carnivorous Seymouriamorpha and the mainly herbivorous Diadectomorpha, with many large forms. The latter group has, in most analysis, the closest relatives of the Amniotes.\n\nTheir terrestrial life style combined with the need to return to the water to lay eggs hatching to larvae (tadpoles) led to a drive to abandon the larval stage and aquatic eggs. A possible reason may have been competition for breeding ponds, to exploit drier environments with less access to open water, or to avoid predation on tadpoles by fish, a problem still plaguing modern amphibians. Whatever the reason, the drive led to internal fertilization and direct development (completing the tadpole stage within the egg). A striking parallel can be seen in the frog family Leptodactylidae, which has a very diverse reproductive system, including foam nests, non-feeding terrestrial tadpoles and direct development. The Diadectomorphans generally being large animals would have had correspondingly large eggs, unable to survive on land.\n\nFully terrestrial life was achieved with the development of the amniote egg, where a number of membranous sacks protect the embryo and facilitate gas exchange between the egg and the atmosphere. The first to evolve was probably the allantois, a sack that develops from the gut/yolk-sack. This sack contains the embryo's nitrogenous waste (urea) during development, stopping it from poisoning the embryo. A very small allantois is found in modern amphibians. Later came the amnion surrounding the fetus proper, and the chorion, encompassing the amnion, allantois, and yolk-sack.\n\nExactly where the border between reptile-like amphibians (non-amniote reptiliomorphs) and amniotes lies will probably never be known, as the reproductive structures involved fossilize poorly, but various small, advanced reptiliomorphs have been suggested as the first true amniotes, including \"Solenodonsaurus\", \"Casineria\" and \"Westlothiana\". Such small animals laid small eggs, 1\u00a0cm in diameter or less. Small eggs would have a small enough volume to surface ratio to be able to develop on land without the amnion and chorion actively effecting gas exchange, setting the stage for the evolution of true amniotic eggs. Although the first true amniotes probably appeared as early as the Middle Mississippian sub-epoch, non-amniote (or amphibian) reptiliomorph lineages coexisted alongside their amniote descendants for many millions of years. By the middle Permian the non-amniote terrestrial forms had died out, but several aquatic non-amniote groups continued to the end of the Permian, and in the case of the chroniosuchians survived the end Permian mass extinction, only to die out prior to the end of the Triassic. Meanwhile, the single most successful daughter-clade of the reptiliomorphs, the amniotes, continued to flourish and evolve into a staggering diversity of tetrapods including mammals, reptiles, and birds.\n\n"

In the 2001 Census it had a population of 5,322. Together with the smaller village of Deane, it forms the Oakley and Deane civil parish renamed as Oakley at the 2011 Census.\n\nOakley appears in the Domesday Book of 1086.\n\nOakley is divided into two districts, East Oakley and Church Oakley. The village sits on chalkland. Its village magazine, \"Link\", is published monthly.\n\nOakley has two linked educational facilities: Oakley CE Junior School and Oakley Infant school, both of which have in the past achieved 'Outstanding' ratings in OFSTED inspections. In 2015 Oakley CE Junior School's overall effectiveness was rated 'Good'. Pupils of Oakley CE Junior School won a BBC learning competition, to create a \"Doctor Who\" mini-adventure. Their winning adventure was entitled \"Death Is the Only Answer\".\n\nOakley contains a small Methodist church, and the ancient Anglican church, St Leonard's. The Anglican church (St John's) was recently demolished for safety reasons and has been translated into a garden of remembrance with the war memorial positioned on the site of the altar.\n\nIn the centre of the village is a duck pond surrounded by thatched dwellings. The duck pond is inhabited by mallard ducks and coots. The village is supplied with local tradesmen, has a surgery (part of a shared practice with the next village of Overton), a central convenience store with a post office, a local butcher's, estate agent (Blue House), pharmacy, veterinary surgery, a local window cleaner and a dental practice. There are three public houses, the Barley Mow, The Fox (on the B3400) and The Beach Arms. A coffee shop was an addition to the village. Its railway station, originally on the West of England Main Line, closed in 1963, and the buildings are now used by other businesses. The village allotment site is next to the old railway station. Situated to the west of the village is Oakley Hall, an 18th-century Georgian manor that is now a hotel, used for weddings, special celebrations and corporate events.\n\nThere are opportunities for walking with the Wayfarers Way close at hand, and a riding stable and riding school are found in the village. Oakley Cricket Club was founded in 1849; OCC's grounds are at Oakley Park, where, on 11 June 1961, the Hampshire cricketer Roy Marshall captained a team for a benefit match. This team, which won the match with 246 runs, also included Arthur Milton and Cliff Michelmore. Oakley Football Club was founded in 1967 by the Chelsea FC footballer, Peter Houseman. Oakley Tennis Club has four hard courts. Oakley Bowling Club was formed in 1978 and plays on the Malshanger Estate.\n\nOakley Parish Council was formed in 1894. In 1966 the East Oakley ward of Wootton St Lawrence became part of the parish and in 1976 the Deane Parish Meeting also joined the council, at which point it became known as Oakley and Deane Parish Council.

    "text": "Commit This to Memory is the second studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, the album was released on June 7, 2005, in the United States by Epitaph Records. The Minnesota-based rock act formed in 1997, developing their emotionally-charged, pop-punk sound over the interim years. Their debut LP, \"I Am the Movie\", saw release on independent label Epitaph in 2003. It was followed with a heavy touring schedule, including stints on the Warped Tour and as the opening\nact for multi-platinum rockers Blink-182. Blink bassist Mark Hoppus took a liking to the quintet, offering to produce their next studio effort.\n\nRecorded over six weeks in late 2004, \"Commit This to Memory\" was created largely at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was partially composed there and in their hometown of Minneapolis, during a period in which frontman Justin Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. He aimed for stronger storytelling in his lyricism, inspired by the work of Tom Waits, Ben Folds, and John K. Samson. Hoppus mainly worked with the band on finalizing song arrangements.\n\nUpon release, the album was viewed as the band\u2019s breakthrough, with its gold-certified lead single \"Everything Is Alright\" adopted as their signature song. The album peaked at number two on \"Billboard\" Independent Albums chart. The singles' music videos achieved rotation on cable channel MTV2 while the band toured alongside Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco. In 2014, \"The A.V. Club\" referred to the album as a pop-punk classic, \"full of hook-laden, keyboard-assisted songs whose bright melodies don't mask the despair and self-loathing lurking beneath them.\"\n\nMotion City Soundtrack was formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Vocalist Justin Pierre and guitarist Joshua Cain were friends who had come up playing in several local bands. Influenced by the synth-heavy rock of bands like the Rentals and Superchunk, the duo formed Motion City Soundtrack in 1997. It went through several lineup changes, with the band gaining permanent members Tony Thaxton (drums), Jesse Johnson\n(keys) and Matthew Taylor (bass) in 2001. The quintet recorded and self-released their debut album, \"I Am the Movie\", in 2002, selling copies out of the back of their tour van for a year. The next year, it was picked up for larger distribution through California-based independent label Epitaph, best-known as the home of punk rockers the Offspring and Bad Religion. The group were part of a abundance of Epitaph signings, including Matchbook Romance and From First to Last, amid concerns the label had strayed too far from its roots, or \"a little too emo.\" The band toured heavily in support of the LP, attracting a new fanbase; their 2004 stint on the famed Vans Warped Tour was considered a \"must-see\" among punk fans.\n\nTheir rise to prominence continued when the group joined Blink-182 - then one of the largest pop-punk acts worldwide - on a European arena tour. That band\u2019s bassist, Mark Hoppus, had first heard of the group from an employee at his clothing company, Atticus Clothing. He enjoyed the group so much that he raved about them in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, and invited them to open for Blink. The six musicians became quick friends, frequently talking backstage before performances. Hoppus was developing an interest in recording music from a production standpoint, having recently acquired a large amount of gear and amplifiers. At the final show of the tour, Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room and asked him to produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited to be a part of the album and accepted the offer.\n\nThe band first began writing songs at their rehearsal space in Minneapolis, which they nicknamed the \"Dungeon\" due to its ability to \"suck the life and energy out of the band.\" For Pierre, the album came at the brink of a personal transition in which he began to seek treatment for alcohol abuse. He left the band during the writing stages for Los Angeles where he moved in with Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Afterwards, the group rejoined Pierre in L.A. to begin recording demos for a month; the change of scenery brought about a new energy for the quintet. \"Commit This to Memory\" would be the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. \"It was also the first time we had a lot more time and money to go in and feel like we were making a real record this time, whereas \"I Am the Movie\" was recorded in little segments here and there and eventually pieced together,\" said drummer Tony Thaxton.\n\nRecording sessions for \"Commit This to Memory\" were booked by Hoppus and scheduled over six weeks at Seedy Underbelly Studios in the L.A. suburb of Valley Village. The studio was actually a rented house that had once belonged to Jeff Porcaro, the drummer for Toto. The band had, according to Hoppus, \"a million ideas and a lot of energy and enthusiasm to make a great record\". Pierre strove for the record to have a sound that resembled the bands Braid, Superchunk, Jawbox and the Pixies. Living in a suburb, the neighbors had called police to the band and Hoppus several times for being too loud at night time, especially when Hoppus brought a Roland TR-808 drum machine outside to work on a song late at night. According to Pierre, Hoppus was not interested in putting his own stamp on the music, but rather bringing out the best in what he saw in the group. Hoppus generally modeled his production after Jerry Finn (a longtime producer of Blink-182), and therefore it involved much watching and listening. \"Mark kept telling us, 'Your name is going to be a lot bigger on the front than mine is on the back',\" recalled Justin Pierre, \"So he would throw suggestions out there but always say, 'Feel free to turn these down.' And we would!\"\n\nPierre characterized Hoppus as both \"very involved and not involved,\" with his job as producer mainly giving notes on the sound of the instruments and offering suggestions to improve songs. Hoppus mostly worked with the band on arrangements, believing the songs were too packed and \"needed to breathe\". Hoppus mentioned that label politics had hindered the creativity of Blink's \"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\" (2001), and did not want to see the same fate befall the band. He was \"meticulous\" in his approach, partially due to the fact that it was his first production job. Hoppus was the one who advised the band to merge two previously unrelated songs\u2014a slower, softer song and a pulsating drum track\u2014into one, which became \"Time Turned Fragile\". The frontman of Fall Out Boy, Patrick Stump, contributed guest vocals to \"Everything Is Alright\", and Hoppus to \"Hangman\". With production completed, Hoppus was very excited for the band that he felt was on the cusp of \"great things\", recalling, \"After six weeks of these guys living all together in two rooms of this house with a studio attached they created this amazingly beautiful and honest album. Justin's lyrics are so brutally truthful.\" The group completed recording in November 2004, and judged final mixes over the interim months. Pierre later called \"Commit This to Memory\" his personal favorite album by the band.\n\nIn a 2015 interview, Pierre notes that fans have told him that they find \"Commit This to Memory\" a \"winter album,\" to which he agrees, noting the unintentional mention of the new year in several songs. His lyricism on \"Commit This to Memory\" centralizes around change and, in his words, \"being a complete fuckup, yet, at the same time, being somewhat successful\". On the record, he \"addresses the themes of substance abuse, psychological disorders and failing relationships.\" Pierre penned \"Everything Is Alright\" as a summary of his OCD (Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder) tendencies. He intended to utilize his social anxiety and fears in the song's form, which he has since employed in numerous other compositions. \"I don't think the [phrase] \"tongue-in-cheek\" is correct, but it's something where the verses are one thing and then the chorus is another, but it's sort of like giving yourself a pep talk,\" said Pierre. The song's lyrics include hating such mundane things as \"theme parks, flying, strangers, [and] waiting in line,\" things that Pierre genuinely disliked at the time of the song's writing. For the record, he intended to simplify his lyrics to enhance storytelling and he drew inspiration from Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson's writing styles. Keeping in the Waits/Folds inspiration, Pierre strove to write from another person's point of view; in the case of \"Time Turned Fragile\", it is sung from the perspective of his father.\n\nPierre has in retrospect labeled half of the album's writing as being completed while inebriated and the other half while getting sober. For example, he penned the lyrics to \"Attractive Today\" and \"Time Turned Fragile\" while drunk in his apartment, in a \"sad and lonely place.\" In this approach, words mostly \"just came out,\" and were not substantially revised. In addition, he was listening to the 2003 album \"Reconstruction Site\" by the Weakerthans, and found himself inspired by the songwriting of frontman John K. Samson. Pierre would often take lyrics from other bands songs for song titles; \"Time Turned Fragile\" is lifted from a lyric in Limbeck's \"Julia\", while \"Together We'll Ring in the New Year\" was pulled from the Tom Waits song \"Please Wake Me Up\". \"L.G. Fuad\"\u2014which stands for \"Let's Get Fucked Up and Die\"\u2014grew out of a night on Motion City Soundtrack's 2003 UK tour with The All-American Rejects, in which the latter band's merchandise manager was severely inebriated. He stood on the merchandise stand and shouted what became the song's refrain. All involved found great humor in the \"mantra\", which went on to be printed on business cards as a joke. \"Hold Me Down\" was inspired by a former roommate of Pierre's. After she had moved out, Pierre found a portion of her math homework in a couch cushion, leading to him imagining a scenario of finding a letter from a departed lover.\n\nThe album has been called definitive of pop punk. Joshua Cain dismissed this label, remarking, \"I definitely wouldn't consider us a pop-punk band. Our influences are more based on '90s bands like Superchunk and early Weezer.\"\n\nUpon its release, \"Commit This to Memory\" received general acclaim from music critics. Scott Heisel of \"Alternative Press\" wrote that \"\"Memory\" is an inspired, mature sophomore disc chock full of catchy, intelligent pop-rock.\" Allmusic's Johnny Loftus considered the band more intelligent and sophisticated than their Warped Tour peers: \"Motion City Soundtrack['s] wistful memories, tales of breaking up, and frantic searches for answers [are] realer than the next pop-punk combo on the quadruple summertime bill.\" Jennifer Maerz of \"Entertainment Weekly\" ended her review with the note that \"MCS' slick, soaring anthems ultimately unite the spirits of those who see themselves, like Pierre, as 'lifeless corners of this empty frame.'\" Mark Griffiths of \"Kerrang!\" wrote, \"It's a bright and invigorating affair [...] and is, in short, fantastic.\" \"The Washington Post\" Marianne Meyer opined that the record \"nimbly moves from skittish rhythms to genuinely tender sentiment.\"\nJessica Grose of \"Spin\" favorably compared it to Blink-182's \"Enema of the State\" (1999). Tony McMenamin of \"Blender\" deemed it the publication's album of the month, calling it \"a charged mix of instantly catchy pop-punk lashings and somber acoustic wailings.\"\n\nThe album was leaked to file sharing websites within a day of the final mastering and months before its official release. It debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the issue dated June 25, 2005 at position 72, selling 16,000 copies in its opening week. It charted better on the magazine's Independent Albums chart, where it peaked at number two. The last official estimate placed it at 285,000 albums sold in the U.S., but Pierre said in 2015 interview that the number is closer to 500,000. The band's music videos found regular rotation on networks such as MTV2, and the band also performed on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". \"Rolling Stone\"s Lauren Gilton considered the album a sleeper hit. Nevertheless, the band's breakthrough brought naysayers, and the group became targets for critics of pop punk: \"[the band was] frequently characterized as the sort of ultra-commercial punk poseurs who water down the genre to the point of drowning it.\"\n\nSubsequent reviews of the album have continued to be positive. In 2014, \"The A.V. Club\" referred to the album as a classic of pop punk, \"full of hook-laden, keyboard-assisted songs whose bright melodies don't mask the despair and self-loathing lurking beneath them.\" Reyan Ali of \"Cincinnati CityBeat\" wrote that \"Commit This to Memory\" \"absolutely bleeds charm,\" commenting, \"Even with all the dire thematic matter Pierre's lyrics covered, [...] the band framed the words with music that sparkled, owing to spunky, inspired hooks, full-sounding record production and ample doses of Moog.\" \"Alternative Press\" Tyler Sharp deemed the record a \"classic,\" while Taylor Morgan of \"OC Weekly\" called it \"the soundtrack of millennial youth, reminiscent of breakups, making out, goofing off, and growing up.\" BuzzFeed included the album at number 21 on their \"36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F\u2014\u2014ing Die\" list. \"NME\" listed the album as one of \"20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic\".\n\nDuring the recording of the album, the band embarked on their first headlining tour, The Sub-Par Punk Who Cares Tour 2004. After recording, the band set out on the inaugural Epitaph Tour, alongside Matchbook Romance and From First to Last, with appearances by the Matches and Scatter the Ashes on select dates. The tour visited every major US city, and ran from February 2 to March 19, 2005. The band played to larger crowds on the tours supporting the album, including over 9,000 fans on a Chicago date in 2005. The group \"toured incessantly,\" including dates on the Warped Tour 2005. Afterwards, the band joined the Nintendo Fusion Tour with Fall Out Boy, Panic! at the Disco, and The Starting Line, which was their largest nationwide tour to that point. The group had been friends with Fall Out Boy for many years prior, having both played side-by-side before either group found their respective success.\n\nThe band embarked on a tour celebrating the tenth anniversary of the album between January and February 2015, playing the album in its entirety. \"It doesn't feel like ten years ago, but then it also feels like a lifetime ago,\" said Pierre. The group later extended this anniversary tour, and further toured the album between June and August 2015.\n\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes. \nBand\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n\nDesign\n\n"

    "title": ".tel",
    "text": "The domain name .tel is a top-level domain (TLD) in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet. It was approved by ICANN as a sponsored top-level domain, and is operated by Telnic. Telnic announced in January 2011 that over 300,000 domains had been registered since the start of general availability on 24 March 2009. A substantial drop of mostly IDN codice_1s occurred at the beginning of 2014 - the current total registered codice_1s as of 21 July 2016 is 98,516 according to the daily domain name count at http://registrarstats.com/TLDDomainCounts.aspx.\n\nThe domain's purpose is to provide a single name space for Internet communications services. Subdomain registrations serve as a single point of contact for individuals and businesses, providing a global contact directory service by hosting all types of contact information directly in the Domain Name System, without the need to build, host or manage a traditional web service. Additionally, as of July 2010, every \"tel\" domain acts as an OpenID and an increasing number of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) clients can address a \"tel\" domain name directly. The TLD implementation also supports the hCard micro-format.\n\nTelnic started publicly accepting applications for name registrations on 3 February 2009 after a closed Sunrise period for trademark holders. Information in \".tel\" can be controlled by the owner through a website control panel that Telnic has created for registrars to provide to their customers, or through free clients for BlackBerry, Microsoft Outlook, iPhone, Android and some third party VoIP softphone clients. With the introduction of support for OAuth in July 2010, however, new third-party clients and services are available to tel registrants for publishing records to their domains securely, including the possibility of editing information offline via SMS gateways. The control panel is an open source application, and can be changed or completely replaced by registrars, as the application programming interfaces required to manage information in the DNS were released by Telnic in October 2008.\n\nWhen viewed over the Web, all tel domains point directly to a Telnic proxy webpage that is populated on the fly presenting the respective domain name owner's contact data stored within the DNS system. domains can also be accessed without opening a browser on many devices through open source applications or through direct DNS lookups.\n\nSince 13 March 2017 additionally other name servers could be set for tel domains, which allows administration of domain name system records. Now tel domains behave like ordinary domains and could be used for web hosting and email.\n\nIn contrast to other top-level domains, \"tel\" information is stored directly within the Domain Name System (DNS), within the actual domain name record, as opposed to the DNS simply returning details (such as IP addresses) of the machines on which information can be found. For example, users who register a .tel domain using Telnic name servers cannot create a type A Resource Record with the IP address of their own host. A user who wants to host a web site or run an own web server has to set own or providers' name servers.\n\nAs Telnic has enabled the DNS records to be encrypted using 1024-bit RSA with PKCS#1.5 padding and stored in sub-folders which are hidden until paired with a public private key handshake with individuals, there is protection from spammers. As \"tel\" also supports any type of contact information, concierge services like temporary email addresses, temporary telephone numbers and so on can all be utilized for additional protection of public information.\n\nThe \"tel\" TLD was released to trademark holders only until 3 February 2009, perhaps suggest that the resulting database of contact information can somehow be trusted as the official contact information of the rightful owner of those trademarks. However, after the short period of registrations restricted to trademark holders only (the Sunrise period), anyone willing to pay a premium price was allowed to buy any domain name (the Landrush period) regardless of who owned the trademark.\n\nFurthermore, during General Availability, anyone is able to register any name (assuming that it is available for registration) without paying a premium price.\n\nThe information held under the .tel domain is no more accurate or trustworthy than any other user defined data held in the DNS system. It will be down to individual .tel owners to choose what they wish to store there.\n\nAs with all other gTLDs, trademark owners can utilize the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) to claim trademarked domains back.\n\nSince some of the services that are expected to use tel domains can be achieved on mobile telephones, there may be overlap with the intended use of the mobi domain, which was also approved by ICANN in the same round.\n\nHowever, \"tel\" is about publishing contact data: phone numbers, SIP addresses and so on directly in the DNS, not on html-based websites., whereas the focus of the .mobi domain is providing web sites and other content formatted specifically for the user interface available on mobile phones and other mobile devices.\n\nPulver.com (operated by Jeff Pulver) also submitted an application for the \"tel\" TLD, but had a different intent. This proposal involved telephone number style numeric identifiers. Alternative viewpoints claimed that this either complemented or conflicted with Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM). Purely numeric identifiers have now been approved for release by Telnic and will be released later in 2011, with the restriction that single-digit \"tel\" domains be withheld in order to avoid confusion with ENUM.\n\n"

    "text": "Longdon-Upon-Tern (also known as Longdon-on-Tern or colloquially Longdon) is a village in east central Shropshire, England. It is in the unitary district of Telford and Wrekin, and is approximately east of Shrewsbury and north-west of Telford. Longdon-Upon-Tern is situated on the River Tern, a tributary of the River Severn.\n\nSettled since at least the Normans, the village is notable as the site of the Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, the first large-scale cast iron navigable aqueduct, designed and built by Thomas Telford for the canal. The aqueduct is Grade I listed and a preserved as a scheduled ancient monument.\n\nThe name Longdon is derived from two Old English words, \"lang\" and \"d\u016bn,\" meaning \"long hill\".\n\nA settlement at Longdon-Upon-Tern dates to at least the Normans, as it is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Languedune\", held by St. Alkmund's Church. It continued with the church until the 12th century when it passed to Lilleshall Abbey until its dissolution in the 16th century. Its Domesday assets were: 2 hides, 5 ploughs, and a mill worth 5s.\n\nLongdon-Upon-Tern is an ecclesiastical parish. In 1988 it merged with Rodington ecclesiastical parish, a close by village, to create the Civil Parish of Rodington with a parish council, to relieve civil responsibilities from the two ecclesiastical parishes. The civil parish boundaries now include the areas of Long Waste, Long Lane, Isombridge, Marsh Green, Sugdon, Rodington, Rodington Heath, and Longdon-Upon-Tern. Although the two separate parishes have now merged into a civil parish with a parish council, the two distinct ecclesiastical parishes maintain both village halls hosting varied community activities.\n\nToday's church is the Church of St Bartholomew. This is a small 18th-century, Grade II listed, Georgian stone and red brick church. Built in 1742 the church has had major alterations and an extension in the late 19th century. On the same site stands the refurbished Grade II* listed Longdon-Upon-Tern village hall, formerly a schoolhouse provided by the Duke of Sutherland and opened in 1849. Due to a decline in population, the school closed in 1970.\n\nThere have been no population figures for Longdon-Upon-Tern since 1961 as the census data from Longdon-Upon-Tern is now included with the Rodington Civil Parish. In 2001 the population for Rodington Civil Parish was 869.\nThe last population figure for Longdon-Upon-Tern in 1961 was 126. In 1801 at the time of the first UK census, the population of Longdon-Upon-Tern was 102 and peaked in 1881 at 131. The adjacent graph shows the total population in Longdon-Upon-Tern from 1801 to 1961.\n\nThe village is particularly notable as the location of the world's first large-scale cast iron navigable aqueduct (, ). Designed by Thomas Telford, the aqueduct opened in 1797 as part of the Shrewsbury Canal. Telford built the cast iron aqueduct to replace a stone aqueduct, originally built by Josiah Clowes, which was swept away by floods in 1795. Although the canal was abandoned in 1944 due to the shift in traffic to the rail networks, the aqueduct remains. It is Grade I listed and a scheduled ancient monument, situated in fields astride the River Tern. The monument is signposted and visible from the road. Clearly marked footpaths lead directly to the monument from a small roadside car park. Telford later designed and built the very much larger Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in Wales, now designated as a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe 65 from Wellington to High Ercall passes through Longdon-Upon-Tern with busses departing every 60 minutes from Wellington.\n\nThe closest railway station is away in Wellington, from here there are frequent services to Shrewsbury and Birmingham.\n\n"

The letter is called back yer or back jer in the pre-reform Russian orthography, in Old East Slavic, and in Old Church Slavonic. Originally the yer denoted an ultra-short or reduced middle rounded vowel. It is one of two reduced vowels that are collectively known as the yers in Slavic philology.\n\nIn Bulgarian, the \"er goljam\" (\"\u0435\u0440 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c\") is the 27th letter of the alphabet. It is used for the phoneme representing the mid back unrounded vowel , sometimes also notated as a schwa . It sounds somewhat like the vowel sound in some pronunciations of English \"but\" or the Chinese \"\"de\" (\u7684) . It is similar to the Romanian letter \"\u0103\" (for example, in \"\"b\u0103iat\"\" ). In unstressed positions (in the same manner as \u27e8\u0430\u27e9), \u27e8\u044a\u27e9 is normally pronounced , which sounds like Sanskrit \"a\" (\u0905), Portuguese \"\"terra\" , or the German -er in the word \"\"Kinder\"\" . Unlike the schwa sound in English, the Bulgarian can appear in unstressed as well as in stressed syllables, for example in \"\"\u0432\u044a\u0301\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\"\" ['v\u0264\u031ezdux] 'air' or even at the beginning of words (only in the word \"\"\u044a\u0301\u0433\u044a\u043b\"\" ['\u0264\u031eg\u0250\u026b] \u2018corner\u2019)\n\nBefore the reform of 1945, this sound was written with two letters, \"\u044a\" and \"\u046b\" (\"big yus\", denoting a former nasal vowel). Additionally \"\u044a\" was used silently after a final consonant, as in Russian. In 1945 final \"\u044a\" was dropped; and the letter \"\u046b\" was abolished, being replaced by \"\u044a\" in most cases. However, to prevent confusion with the former silent final \"\u044a\", final \"\u046b\" was replaced instead with \"\u0430\" (which has the same sound when not stressed).\n\nIt is variously transliterated as \u27e8\u01ce\u27e9, \u27e8\u0103\u27e9, \u27e8\u0105\u27e9, \u27e8\u00eb\u27e9, \u27e8\u0119\u27e9, \u27e8\u0173\u27e9, \u27e8\u016d\u27e9, or simply \u27e8a\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9 and even \u27e8y\u27e9.\n\nThe letter is not used in the alphabets of Belarusian and Ukrainian, its functions being performed by the apostrophe. In the Latin Belarusian alphabet (\u0141acinka), the hard sign's functions are performed by \"j\".\n\nAlthough Macedonian is closely related to Bulgarian, its writing system does not use the \"yer\". During the creation of the modern Macedonian orthography from the fall of 1944 to the spring of 1945, the \"yer\" was one of the subjects of arguments. The problem was that the corresponding vowel exists in many dialects of Macedonian, but it is not systematically present in the west-central dialect, the base on which the Macedonian language standard was being developed.\n\nAmong the leaders of the Macedonian alphabet and orthography design team, Venko Markovski argued for using the letter \"yer\", much like the Bulgarian orthography does, but Bla\u017ee Koneski was against it. An early version of the alphabet promulgated on December 28, 1944, contained the \"yer\", but in the final version of the alphabet, approved in May 1945, Koneski's point of view prevailed, and no \"yer\" was used.\n\nThe absence of \"yer\" leads to an apostrophe often being used in Macedonian to print texts composed in the language varieties that use the corresponding vowel, such as the Bulgarian writer Konstantin Miladinov's poem \"Taga za Jug\" (\"\u0422\u044a\u0433\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u044e\u0433\").\n\nIn Modern Russian, the letter \"\u044a\" is called the \"hard sign\" (\u0442\u0432\u0451\u0440\u0434\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a / \"tvjordyj znak\"). It has no phonetic value of its own and is purely an orthographic device. Its function is to separate a number of prefixes ending in consonants from subsequent morphemes that begin with iotated vowels. It is therefore commonly seen in front of the letters \"\u044f\", \"\u0435\", \"\u0451\", and \"\u044e\" (\"ja\", \"je\", \"jo\", and \"ju\" in English). The hard sign marks the fact that the sound continues to be heard separately in the composition. For example:\n\nIt therefore functions as a kind of \"separation sign\" and has been used only sparingly in the aforementioned cases since the spelling reform of 1918. The consonant before the hard sign often becomes somewhat softened (palatalized) due to the following iotation. As a result, in the twentieth century there were occasional proposals to eliminate the hard sign altogether, and replace it with the soft sign \u044c, which always marks the softening of a consonant. However, in part because the degree of softening before \u044a is not uniform, the proposals were never implemented. The hard sign \u044a is written after both native and borrowed prefixes. It is sometimes used before \"\u0438\" (\"i\"), non-iotated vowels or even consonants in Russian transcriptions of foreign names to mark an unexpected syllable break (e.g. \u2014 Chang'an), the Arabic \u2018ayn (e.g. \u2014 Dara'a, ), or a Khoisan click (e.g. \u2014 \u01c2Hoan), similarly to the use of the apostrophe when transcribing such names in English. However, such usage is not uniform and, except for transliteration of Chinese proper names, has not yet been formally codified (see also Russian phonology and Russian orthography).\n\nBefore 1918, a hard sign was normally written at the end of a word when following a non-palatal consonant, even though it had no effect on pronunciation. For example, the word for \"cat\" was written \"\u043a\u043e\u0442\u044a\" (\"kotj\") before the reform, and \"\u043a\u043e\u0442\" (\"kot\") after it. This old usage of \u044a was eliminated by the spelling reform of 1918, implemented by the Bolshevik regime after the 1917 October Revolution. Because of the way this reform was implemented, the issue became politicized, leading to a number of printing houses in Petrograd refusing to follow the new rules. To force the printing houses to comply, red sailors of the Baltic Fleet confiscated type carrying the \"parasite letters\". Printers were forced to use a non-standard apostrophe for the separating hard sign, for example:\n\nIn the beginning of the 1920s, the hard sign was gradually restored as the separator. The apostrophe was still used afterward on some typewriters that did not include the hard sign, which became the rarest letter in Russian. In Belarusian and Ukrainian, the hard sign was never brought back, and the apostrophe is still in use today.\n\nAccording to the rough estimation presented in Lev Uspensky's popular linguistics book \"A Word On Words\" (\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0445 / \"Slovo o slovah\"), which expresses strong support for the reform, the final hard sign occupied about 3.5% of the printed texts and essentially wasted a considerable amount of paper, which provided the economic grounds to the reform.\n\nPrinting houses set up by Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s abroad kept using the pre-reform orthography for some time, but gradually they adopted the new spelling. Meanwhile in the USSR, \"Dahl\u2019s Explanatory Dictionary\" was repeatedly (1935, 1955) reprinted in compliance with the old rules of spelling and the pre-reform alphabet.\n\nToday the final \"yer\" is sometimes used in Russian brand names: the newspaper \"Kommersant\" (\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u044a) uses the letter to emphasize its continuity with the pre-Soviet newspaper of the same name. Such usage is often inconsistent, as the copywriters may apply the simple rule of putting the hard sign after a consonant at the end of a word but ignore the other former spelling rules, such as the use of \u0463 and \u0456. It is also sometimes encountered in humorous personal writing adding to the text an \"old-fashioned flavour\" or separately, denoting \"true\".\n\nIn Cyrillic orthographies for various languages of the Caucasus, along with the soft sign and the palochka, the hard sign is a modifier letter, used extensively in forming digraphs and trigraphs designating sounds alien in Slavic, such as /q/ and ejectives. For example, in Ossetian, the hard sign is part of the digraphs \u0433\u044a /\u0281/, \u043a\u044a /k\u02bc/, \u043f\u044a /p\u02bc/, \u0442\u044a /t\u02bc/, \u0445\u044a /q/, \u0446\u044a /ts\u02bc/, \u0447\u044a /t\u0283\u02bc/, as well as the trigraphs \u043a\u044a\u0443 /k\u02b7\u02bc/ and \u0445\u044a\u0443 /q\u02b7/. The hard sign is used in the Crimean Tatar language for the same purpose.\n\n"

    "title": "Camanachd Association",
    "text": "The Camanachd Association (in Scottish Gaelic, \"Comann na Camanachd\") is the world governing body of the Scottish sport of shinty. The body is based in Inverness, Highland, and is in charge of the rules of the game. Its main competitions are the Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup and the Mowi Premiership and the Mowi Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup.\n\nThe Camanachd Association was founded in 1893 after a meeting in Kingussie in order to formalize a set of rules for the many shinty clubs across the British Isles.\n\nThe Camanachd Association maintained its initial structure for much of its first century but the \u2018Future of Shinty' Report published in 1981 led to a compete restructuring of the way in which shinty was organised and managed. That, in turn, led to the move away from a dependence on volunteers to govern the sport, to the Association's first salaried employees being employed. This also resulted in the other myriad associations which organised shinty coming under the Association. Other associations which still have a strong role in organising shinty are the Glasgow Celtic Society, the Macaulay Association and the Schools Camanachd Association.\n\nIn 2005, the Camanachd Association took the decision to change its structure again and moved to being a company limited by guarantee with no share capital. The company is overseen by a board of directors, most of whom are volunteers who are chosen by the members at the AGM.\n\nThe membership of the association consists of shinty clubs and related associations, such as the Glasgow Celtic Society. The membership appoints non-salaried office-bearers through the Annual General Meeting, which is also the only medium through which the playing rules of shinty can be altered.\n\nCOMPETITIONS\n\nNewtonmore defeated Lovat by three goals to nil to retain the 2018 Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup. The final which was played at Mossfield Stadium, Oban was Newtonmore\u2019s 3rd consecutive victory and their 33rd in total. Despite two North teams contesting \u2013 shinty\u2019s BIG day out! - the final in Oban attracted a crowd in excess of 2,000 spectators, plus a large additional audience tuning in via live TV, radio and online broadcasts. Newtonmore forward Evan Menzies, who scored two goals, won the Albert Smith Medal for Man of the Match.\nThe 2018 Artemis Macaulay Cup Final in Oban proved to be an exciting game, with Kinlochshiel defeating Kyles Athletic by three goals to two in a thrilling match with the destiny of the trophy in doubt until the final whistle. Both these finals were broadcast live on BBC2 Scotland.\n\nNewtonmore defeated Kinlochshiel by two goals to one to retain the Cottages.com MacTavish Cup at Bught Park, Inverness in a match which was broadcast live on BBC ALBA. The Glasgow Celtic Society Cup Final was also broadcast live on BBC ALBA and was won by Oban Camanachd who defeated Kyles Athletic by two goals to nil at Taynuilt.\nThe Liberty British Aluminium Balliemore Cup Final was held at An Aird, Fort William where Kilmallie triumphed over Glasgow Mid Argyll by three goals to two.\nThe Aberdein Considine Sutherland Cup Final was won by Newtonmore, who defeated Kingussie by five goals to two at The Dell, Kingussie.\n\nLochside Rovers won the Bullough Cup defeating Kyles Athletic by five goals to two in an exciting encounter played at Strachur. Newtonmore defeated Fort William to win the Strathdearn Cup with a four goals to nil victory at the Bught Park, Inverness.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Cup Finals Day again took place at The Dell, Kingussie. Badenoch & Strathspey triumphed in the Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup defeating Skye by four goals to one whilst Glenurquhart won the Marine Harvest Challenge Cup by four goals to three against Inverness. The Finals Day was once again an excellent occasion, with a large crowd and some exciting shinty being played. The Valerie Fraser Camanachd Cup was broadcast live on BBC ALBA for the first time.\n\nThe Marine Harvest Senior Men\u2019s Shinty/Hurling International between Scotland and Ireland at the Bught Park on 20 October was won by Scotland, their fifth consecutive Bught Park victory, to retain the Marine Harvest Quaich. The final score was Scotland 1 \u2013 11 (14) and Ireland 1 \u2013 9 (12). Scotland\u2019s Senior Women played their Shinty/Camogie challenge match against Dublin at the Bught Park prior to the Senior International. The final score was Scotland 4 \u2013 1 (13) Dublin 0 \u2013 2 (2). Scotland defeated their Irish counterparts to win the Marine Harvest Under 21 Shinty / Hurling International trophy in a match played on 3 November at Abbotstown, the GAA\u2019s National Development Centre in Dublin. The score was Ireland 2 \u2013 7 (13) Scotland 6 \u2013 7 (25).\n\nParticipation in the senior leagues in 2018 dropped to 53 teams from 54 in 2017, as a result of Dunoon not entering a team. The Marine Harvest Premiership comprised ten teams, with eight teams in the Marine Harvest National Div, there were eight teams in Marine Harvest North Div 1 and eleven teams in Marine Harvest North Div 2, Marine Harvest South Div 1 had ten teams with six teams in Marine Harvest South Div 2.\nIn total there have been 655 senior fixtures scheduled in 2018, compared to 689 in 2017. 29 fixtures were unfulfilled due to team raising difficulties, down from 39 in 2017. 92 fixtures were postponed and rescheduled compared to 125 in 2017, of that 92, 53 were due to unplayable fields and 8 due to bereavement, a further 26 were rescheduled at the request of both clubs in compliance with the Byelaws. During 2018, 12 fixtures were reversed or transferred to an alternative venue to ensure the game took place on the scheduled date, this compares with 9 in the previous year, 14 fixtures were played midweek.\n\nNewtonmore won The Marine Harvest Premiership by six points despite losing two of their first 4 league fixtures; this was their eighth league title in the last nine years. Both Skye and Glenurquhart, having finished in the bottom two positions of the Premiership, are relegated and both will play in the Marine Harvest National Division in 2019. Kilmallie won the Marine Harvest National Division, and they will be joined in the Premiership by Inveraray.\nNewtonmore won Marine Harvest North Div 1 again but being a 2nd Team, they are not eligible to be promoted. Bute won Marine Harvest South Div 1 and will play in the Marine Harvest National Division in 2019. Lovat won Marine Harvest North Div 2 and are promoted to play in Marine Harvest North Div 1 in 2019 with Aberdeen University, who finished bottom of Marine Harvest North Div 1 replacing them. Strachur won Marine Harvest South Div 2 dropping only 2 points. Kilmory will replace them in Marine Harvest South Div 2. With only two fixtures remaining Kilmory advised that they were unable to complete their league programme and wished to withdraw from the league; however, they hope to regroup and play in Marine Harvest South Div 2 next season. All results involving Kilmory were removed from the league as one of their remaining fixtures could have affected the outcome of the title.\n\nThe association co-ordinates the Scotland national shinty team, which plays annually against Ireland in the Shinty/Hurling International Series, a series played under the hybrid rules of Composite rules shinty\u2013hurling.\n\n"

He is the 12th Imam according to the Isma'ili faith.\n\nAl-Qa'im was born in Salamiyah in Syria in 895 with the name Muhammad. After his father Abd Allah al-Mahdi Billah (910-934) seized power in Ifriqiya he was named heir to the throne in 912, and helped put down several revolts. However campaigns into Egypt (in 914\u2013915 and 919\u2013921) faltered against the resistance of the Abbasids, with heavy casualties.\n\nIn 934 Al-Qa'im succeeded his father as Caliph, after which he never again left the royal residence at Mahdia. Nevertheless, the Fatimid realm became an important power in the Mediterranean. After the re-conquest of Sicily the Byzantine province of Calabria and the Ligurian coast was plundered and the city of Genoa sacked.\n\nBut from 944 to 947 the realm was plunged into crisis by the revolt of Abu Yazid, who had united the Kharijite Berber tribes of the Aur\u00e8s Mountains of eastern Algeria and overrun Ifriqiya. Imam Al-Qa'im was able to hold out in Mahdia with the help of the navy for over a year, but died (17 May 946) before the revolt could be put down.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Ismail al-Mansur (946-953). He died on 13th Shawwal 334 AH (Mahdiyya) / 17 May 946 AD.\n\nHe was married already at an early age, before his family left Salamiya. His wife, Umm Habiba, apparently was still a child when she accompanied him to the Maghreb. He also had six known concubines, of which one, Karima, became the mother of his successor al-Mansur.\n\n\n"

    "text": "Matija Gubec (, ) ( 1548 \u2013 15 February 1573), with his real name Ambroz Gubec (or \"Gobec\"), was a Croatian revolutionary, best known as the leader of the Croatian\u2013Slovene Peasant Revolt of 1573. He was part of the court of three people that governed the rebels.\n\nThe name \"Matija\" first appears in the work of the Hungarian historian Mikl\u00f3s Istv\u00e1nffy in 1622. Probably Istv\u00e1nffy attributed this name to him after the good King Matija, and later the two, and the peasant king, Gy\u00f6rgy D\u00f3zsa (leader of the Hungarian peasant revolt in 1514), merged in folk traditions.\n\nBefore the revolt, Gubec was a serf on the estate of the landowner Ferenc Tahy. When the revolt erupted, the peasants elected him to be one of the leaders, and renowned for his personal qualities, he became the most influential leader of the rebellion. During his brief tenure he showed ability as a capable administrator and inspiring leader that would later create a legend. He earned the nickname \"Gubec Beg\".\n\nMatija Gubec led the peasant army during its last stand at the Battle of Stubi\u010dko Polje on 9 February 1573. Before the battle he made a speech trying to convince the men that only victory could bring them freedom, while the defeat would bring more misery. After the defeat he was captured and taken to Zagreb. On 15 February he was publicly tortured, being forced to wear a red-hot iron crown, cruelly dragged along the streets of the city, pinched with red-hot iron pincers, and was subsequently quartered.\n\nWhile Matija Gubec's cause was defeated, his legacy continued to be preserved in local folklore throughout the centuries. In the 20th century, the Croatian Peasant Party, and later Josip Broz Tito and the Yugoslav Partisans, embraced his cause as their own. During World War II, a Croatian and Slovenian brigade were named after him. He is also depicted as the protagonist of \"Gubec-beg\" (1975), the first Croatian rock opera. A museum of Croatian-Slovenian peasant revolt led by him is founded in Or\u0161i\u0107 Castle in Gornja Stubica, near the place of his last battle.\n\nIn 2008, a total of 362 streets in Croatia were named after Matija Gubec, making him the most common person eponym of streets in the country.\n"

    "title": "Philippe de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re",
    "text": "(Pierre Louis) Philippe de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re (c. 1715 \u2013 30 October 1773) was an 18th-century French architect whose main commissions were from Karl Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\nPhilippe was born in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine, south of Paris, the son of Lucien de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re, clerk of the works at the ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux, where the architect employed by Louis XIV's natural son, the duc du Maine, had been his uncle, Jacques de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re (1670\u20131734).\n\nApparently having followed the architectural courses of the theoretician Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel, from the 1730s La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re took courses in architecture in Paris. He attended the Acad\u00e9mie royale d'architecture. In 1750 he issued his engraved folio volume \"Plans, coupes et \u00e9l\u00e9vations de diff\u00e9rents palais et \u00e9glises\". That same year Leopoldo Retti, who was engaged in building the Neues Schloss in Stuttgart for Karl Eugen, made an artistic reconnoitering trip to Paris, in the company of the duke's garden designer Hemmerling. In Paris he oversaw the engraving of a suite of four folio sheets of the floorplan, section, elevations and profiles of the schloss that was being built. In Paris he may have encountered La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re. At any rate, in 1752 Karl Eugen named La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re architect to his court of W\u00fcrttemberg, to fill the post left empty by the unexpected death of Retti, in September the previous year.\n\nLa Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re was one of the group of French-trained architects, like Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s in Munich, who brought the latest French style to the small German courts. He was occupied with works at the ducal \"Residenz\" of Stuttgart, the Neues Schloss that was built adjacent to the former palace , and also at that of Karlsruhe. He was also responsible for the palatial retreat Schloss Solitude near Stuttgart and the waterside \"Schloss\" of Monrepos in the grounds of Ludwigsburg (1760\u201364).\n\nAt Stuttgart La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re lost little time in engraving and publishing further designs. His \"Recueil de diff\u00e9rens projets d\u2019architecture repr\u00e9sentant plusieurs monuments publics et autres\" (Stuttgart, Jean Nicolas Stoll) was published on 11 December 1752. Like his Paris engravings, it broke with earlier traditions of architectural treatises by featuring just the works of a single architect (Klaiber).\n\nLa Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re's work at the Stuttgart \"Neues Schloss\" was never completed. By 1756 the shell of the wing that faced the city was completed, the central \"Mittelbau\" erected and the interior decoration in the garden wing was complete. First the garden wing was destroyed by fire in 1762, then Karl Eugen faced opposition over his extravagance and abandoned Stuttgart for Ludwigsburg. The \"Neues Schloss\" was bombed to a ruin in World War II and has been rebuilt as a shell with modern interiors and some reproduced reception rooms .\n\nAt Ludwigsburg Palace, the alternate seat of the duke, La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re was occupied in 1757\u20131758, in providing a court theater and in refurbishing the main block of the palace. Here the palace was not badly damaged in World War II. The theatre retains its stage machinery constructed under the direction of La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re, the oldest surviving stage machinery preserved in Europe. The water pavilion Monrepos was built from 1755 and completed in 1764 [Hlawtsch 1991].\n\nHe left W\u00fcrttemberg in 1768, with Schloss Solitude almost completed, to return to Paris, where he was one of the first architects to turn away from Rococo, developing his style towards the \"Go\u00fbt grec\" the \"Greek taste' that was the early forerunner of neoclassicism. His folio volume \"Recueil d'esquisses d'architecture\" was issued from Paris in 1765.\n\nLa Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re was the architect of the neoclassical \"h\u00f4tel de ville\" of Montb\u00e9liard in Franche-Comt\u00e9, where his patron Karl Eugen was \"stathouder\". The \"corps de logis\" of the ch\u00e2teau was also rebuilt in more stylish and commodious fashion.\n\nHis works in France include interiors (since replaced) for the former biblioth\u00e8que Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. A pavilion to contain a menagerie at the Ch\u00e2teau de Sceaux, sometimes credited to him, was built by Jacques de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re.\n\nHe died in Paris.\n\nThe only monograph devoted to La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re is Hans Andreas Klaiber's \"Der W\u00fcrttembergische Oberbaudirektor Philippe de La Gu\u00eapi\u00e8re: Ein Beitrag zur Kunstgeschichte der Architektur am Ende des Sp\u00e4tbarock\", published in Stuttgart in 1959.\n\n"

The NF denied that Verrall was the author in a 1978 edition of \"World in Action\".\n\nIn 1983, Holocaust survivor Sabina Citron began a private prosecution under s.181 of the Canadian Criminal Code against Z\u00fcndel, charging him with spreading false news. She was subsequently joined in her proceedings against Z\u00fcndel by the government of Ontario. The Supreme Court concluded in the 1988 trial that \"The pamphlet \"Did Six Million Really Die?\" does not fit with received views of reality because it is not part of reality.\"\n\nIn the work, Verrall doubts the Holocaust death toll, criticising the claim which says that \"no less than six million Jews exterminated\" in concentration camps. The booklet targets various war crime trials, the best known of these being the Nuremberg trials and the Adolf Eichmann trial, criticising their legal integrity and the standards of evidence presented, as well as the impartiality and objectivity of the judges.\n\nVerrall also attempts to demonstrate in the book that censuses and population charts show that the European Jewish population figures do not allow for a figure of six million Jews to have been exterminated. He argues that the total Jewish population in Nazi-controlled Europe after emigrations and evacuations was \"around three million\".\n\nHe further argues that the scale of the Holocaust had been exaggerated by the Allies\n\nVerrall's aim is to argue that the history of the 'six million' holocaust is used to discourage any form of nationalism and is a danger to the preservation of the Anglo-Saxon race:\n\"No one could have anything but admiration for the way in which the Jews have sought to preserve their race through so many centuries, and continue to do so today. In this effort they have frankly been assisted by the story of the Six Million, which, almost like a religious myth, has stressed the need for greater Jewish racial solidarity. Unfortunately, it has worked in quite the opposite way for all other peoples, rendering them impotent in the struggle for self-preservation.\"\n\nIn discussing the Gerstein report, the pamphlet states that \"Gerstein's sister was congenitally insane and died by euthanasia\", effectively admitting the mass murder of civilians by the Nazis in the T4 program.\n\nIn writing his booklet, Verrall had used material published in the 1950s and 1960s and most of the inaccuracies of his booklet were errors originally made by Paul Rassinier whose works Verrall had used extensively.\n\nThe booklet was examined by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1985 and 1988 in the prosecution of the publisher Z\u00fcndel under the Criminal Code, section 181, of spreading false news. The 1985 conviction was overturned on appeal, leading to a second prosecution in 1988 which again resulted in a sentence of 15 months.\n\nAs part of Z\u00fcndel's legal defence, Z\u00fcndel hired Fred A. Leuchter to visit the Auschwitz and Majdanek concentration camps. At the trial, Leuchter was required to defend his report in his capacity as expert witness; however, he was dismissed because during the proceedings it became apparent that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such. The 1988 trial judge concluded that the booklet \"misrepresented the work of historians, misquoted witnesses, fabricated evidence, and cited non-existent authorities.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court did find that in the previous lower court trial, the jury were improperly instructed:\n\nThe jury was instructed that it was entitled to infer from the judge's instruction that because the Holocaust must be regarded as proven, the accused must have known it to be proven and must be taken to have published his pamphlet deliberately for personal motives, knowing the falsity of his assertion to the contrary.\u00a0... The verdict flowed inevitably from the indisputable fact of the publication of the pamphlet, its contents' divergence from the accepted history of the Holocaust, and the public interest in maintaining racial and religious tolerance.\n\nHowever, in reviewing the proceedings of the lower court trial, the Supreme Court were convinced that the facts in the pamphlet were indeed false:\n\n[During the previous trial] the appellant's allegations of fact in the pamphlet were divided into 85 extracts and rebutted one by one. The trial judge summarized this material at length for the jury but it will suffice here to point only to some of the more egregious examples. The pamphlet alleged that a memorandum from Joseph Goebbels revealed that the Final Solution was never more than a plan to evacuate Jews to Madagascar. It was shown that there was no such memorandum but that the reference was to Goebbels' diary entry of March 7, 1942. This diary extract was adduced and shown to state nothing of the kind. The Crown went on to point out that the entry for March 27, 1942 made clear that the Final Solution was, in fact, genocide: \"Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole, it can be said that about 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated, whereas only about 40 per cent can be used for forced labor\u00a0...\"\n\nThe pamphlet alleges that no documentary evidence exists of the Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews. The Crown adduced speeches by Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, made on October 4, 1943, to his troops in Posen in which he refers to the program of extermination of the Jews. Himmler stated: \"I also want to talk to you, quite frankly, on a very grave matter. Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.\u00a0... I mean the clearing out of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish race\u00a0...\"\nThe appellant argued that the term \"exterminate\" used in this passage really meant \"deport\". It was left to the jury to consider whether they accepted that this was a possible interpretation.\nThe Crown also adduced the December 9, 1942, entry in the diary of Hans Frank, Governor-General of occupied Poland's 'General Government' territory, describing the annihilation of 3.5 million Jews in the General Government and numerous documents adduced at the Nuremberg trials, including the daily reports of the Einsatzgruppen (action groups) enumerating the death tolls of Jews in the USSR. In a report to Hitler of December 20, 1942, Himmler indicates that the Einsatzgruppen had executed 363,211 Jews between August and November, 1942.\n\nThe pamphlet alleged, purportedly relying on a Red Cross report, that all concentration camps were really humane work camps. Mr. Biedermann, a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross, testified that the Red Cross Report pertained exclusively to prisoner of war camps as the Red Cross personnel had not been inside any camps in which civilians were detained. The Crown adduced evidence from Professor Hilberg that while some camps had labour facilities annexed to them, Belzec, Treblinka, Sobibor and Chelmno were exclusively \"killing factories\" and that gas chambers were in operation at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek. The numbers of Jews slaughtered was verifiable from railway records showing the payments per person made for transport to the camps. These numbers were compared with those having left the camps or who were found there after liberation.\n\nOn and on, the Crown showed that the appellant misrepresented the work of historians, misquoted witnesses, fabricated evidence, and cited non-existent authorities.\n\nUltimately the Supreme Court concluded:\n\nThe conflict between the assertions made by the appellant and those made by orthodox Holocaust historians cannot be resolved through reasoned debate. Orthodox historians point to sources which support their theories; the appellant and other \"revisionist\" historians point to documents which do not exist or which do not say what they claim they do. The pamphlet \"Did Six Million Really Die?\" does not fit with received views of reality because it is not part of reality.\n\nAlthough in the end he was not required to do so, the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper offered to give evidence, stating that \"behind a simulated objectivity of expression, it is in fact an irresponsible and tendentious publication which avoids material evidence and presents selected half-truths and distortions for the sole purpose of sowing anti-Semitic propaganda\".\n\nAnthony Hancock re-published \"Did Six Million Really Die?\" and made a significant amount of money from doing so , to the point where he was sued for royalties in the High Court in 1982.\n\nIn 1975 South African authors Arthur Suzman and Denis Diamond published a book confronting the claims made by Verrall titled \"Six Million Did Die\" (Johannesburg). A second edition of the book was published in 1978. The first half of the book seeks to disprove claims made by Verrall and the second to provide further evidence of the Holocaust.\nIn 1985 and 1988 Verrall's publisher Ernst Z\u00fcndel was tried in Canada on charges of \"false news\". He was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months in prison. On appeal his conviction was overturned by the Canadian Supreme Court's landmark decision \"R v Zundel\", when it declared that the law under which he had been charged, \"reporting false news\", was unconstitutional.\n\n\"Did Six Million Really Die?\" was banned in Germany and South Africa.\n\nIn 2017, Amazon.com removed the book along with other Holocaust-denying books from its U.S. and U.K. sites.\n"

    "title": "Haldane principle",
    "text": "In British research policy, the Haldane principle is the idea that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians. It is named after Richard Burdon Haldane, who in 1904 and from 1909 to 1918 chaired committees and commissions which recommended this policy, which has evolved over time since then. \n\nThe 1904 committee recommended the creation of the University Grants Committee which has evolved via the Universities Funding Council into the current higher education funding councils: Research Councils UK, Higher Education Funding Council for England, Scottish Funding Council and Higher Education Funding Council for Wales.\n\nIn 1918 Haldane's committee produced the \"Haldane Report\". The report suggested that research required by government departments could be separated into that required by specific departments and that which was more general. It recommended that departments should oversee the specific research but the general research should be under the control of autonomous Research Councils, which would be free from political and administrative pressures that might discourage research in certain areas. The principle of the autonomy of the research councils is now referred to as the Haldane Principle. The first research council to be created as a result of the Haldane Report was the Medical Research Council.\n\nThe principle has remained enshrined in British Government policy, but has been criticised and altered over the years. In 1939 J.D. Bernal argued that social good was more important than researchers' freedom in deciding the direction of research. Solly Zuckerman criticised it in 1971 for its artificial separation of basic and applied science, and the consequent elevation of the status of the former.\n\nA major revision to the application of the Haldane Principle in British research funding came in the early 1970s with the Rothschild Report of 1971, and its implementation which transferred about 25% of the then Research Council funds, and the decisions on the research to be funded with them, back to government departments, a move later undone by Margaret Thatcher's government.\n\nIn a written ministerial statement on 10 December 2010 The Minister for Universities and Science (David Willetts) further elaborated on the definition of the Haldane Principle. Broadly he defined the principle that the tactical implementation of government funding, i.e. which projects to fund should be a decision for academics using a process of peer review.\n\n\"The Haldane principle means that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken by researchers themselves through peer review. This involves evaluating the quality, excellence and likely impact of science and research programmes. Prioritisation of an individual research council\u2019s spending within its allocation is not a decision for Ministers...There are areas where Ministers should have no input: Ministers should not decide which individual projects should be funded nor which researchers should receive the money. This has been crucial to the international success of British science.\"\n\nDavid Willetts also gave a further definition of how this tactical implementation might be guided. \"Overall, excellence is and must remain the driver of funding decisions, and it is only by funding excellent research that the maximum benefits will be secured for the nation.\"\n\nDavid Willetts continued that overall strategic budget setting was the responsibility of government. \"At the other end of the spectrum there are decisions that ultimately must be for Ministers, albeit informed by external advice; these include the overall size of the funding for science and research and its distribution between the research councils, the national academies and higher education research funding.\" \n\nThere is currently a debate about the extent to which the principle is still applied in practice.\n\nThe Higher Education and Research Act 2017, which merged the research councils and the research part of the Higher Education Funding Council for England into UK Research and Innovation, enacted the Haldane principle as section 103(3): \"The \u201cHaldane principle\u201d is the principle that decisions on individual research proposals are best taken following an evaluation of the quality and likely impact of the proposals (such as a peer review process).\" The law did not use David Willetts definition that \"Overall, excellence is and must remain the driver of funding decisions, and it is only by funding excellent research that the maximum benefits will be secured for the nation.\"\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Doctor Atomic",
    "text": "Doctor Atomic is an opera by the contemporary American composer John Adams, with libretto by Peter Sellars. It premiered at the San Francisco Opera on October 1, 2005. The work focuses on the great stress and anxiety experienced by those at Los Alamos while the test of the first atomic bomb (the \"Trinity\" test) was being prepared. In 2007, a documentary was made about the creation of the opera, titled \"Wonders Are Many\".\n\nThe first act takes place about a month before the bomb is to be tested, and the second act is set in the early morning of July 16, 1945 (the day of the test). During the second act, time frequently slows down for the characters and then snaps back into reality. The opera ends in the final, prolonged moment before the bomb is detonated. Although the original commission for the opera suggested that U.S. physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the \"father of the atomic bomb,\" be fashioned as a 20th-century Doctor Faustus, Adams and Sellars deliberately attempted to avoid this characterization. Alice Goodman worked for two years with Adams on the project before leaving, objecting to the characterization of Edward Teller, as dictated by the original commission.\n\nThe work centers on key players in the Manhattan Project, especially Robert Oppenheimer, General Leslie Groves, and also features Kitty Oppenheimer, Robert's wife. Sellars adapted the libretto from primary historical sources.\n\n\"Doctor Atomic\" is similar in style to previous Adams operas \"Nixon in China\" and \"The Death of Klinghoffer\", both of which explored the characters and personalities that were involved in historical incidents, rather than a re-enactment of the events themselves.\n\nMuch of the text from the opera was adapted from declassified U.S. government documents and communications among the scientists, government officials, and military personnel who were involved in the project. Other borrowed texts include poetry by Charles Baudelaire and Muriel Rukeyser, the Holy Sonnets of John Donne, quotes from the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and a traditional Tewa Indian song.\n\nOpening chorus\n\nMarvin Cohen, professor of physics at UC Berkeley and president of the American Physical Society at the time, criticized some parts of the libretto for not being strictly scientifically correct, in particular the original opening lines which were excerpted from the 1945 Smyth Report:\n\nFollowing Cohen's criticism, Adams rewrote the opening chorus, so that it now reads:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">We believed that\n\"Matter can be neither\ncreated nor destroyed\nbut only altered in form.\"\nWe believed that\n\"Energy can be neither\ncreated nor destroyed\nbut only altered in form.\"\nBut now we know that\nenergy may become matter,\nand now we know that\nmatter may become energy\nand thus be altered in form.</poem>\n\nConclusion of act 1\n\nThe aria, sung by Oppenheimer, uses text from Donne's Holy Sonnet XIV:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">Batter my heart, three person\u2019d God; For you\nAs yet but knock, breathe, knock, breathe, knock, breathe\nShine, and seek to mend;\nBatter my heart, three person\u2019d God;\nThat I may rise, and stand, o\u2019erthrow me, and bend\nYour force, to break, blow, break, blow, break, blow\nburn and make me new.\n\nI, like an usurpt town, to another due,\nLabor to admit you, but Oh, to no end,\nReason your viceroy in me, me should defend,\nBut is captiv\u2019d, and proves weak or untrue,\nYet dearly I love you, and would be lov\u2019d fain,\nBut am betroth\u2019d unto your enemy,\nDivorce me, untie, or break that knot again,\nTake me to you, imprison me, for I\nExcept you enthrall me, never shall be free,\nNor ever chaste, except you ravish me.</poem>\n\nThe act 2, scene iii chorus\n\nThis was borrowed from the \"Bhagavad Gita\" (translated into English by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood) and reads:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">At the sight of this, your Shape stupendous,\nFull of mouths and eyes, feet, thighs and bellies,\nTerrible with fangs, O master,\nAll the worlds are fear-struck, even just as I am.\n\nWhen I see you, Vishnu, omnipresent,\nShouldering the sky, in hues of rainbow,\nWith your mouths agape and flame-eyes staring\u2014\nAll my peace is gone; my heart is troubled.</poem>\n\nAct 2 traditional Tewa song\n\nThis act is peppered with a repeated refrain from Pasqualita, the Oppenheimers' Tewa Indian housemaid. The text comes from a traditional Tewa song, and subsequent reiterations repeat the text with the direction changed to \"west\", \"east\", and \"south\": \n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">In the north the cloud-flower blossoms\nAnd now the lightning flashes\nAnd now the thunder clashes\nAnd now the rain comes down! A-a-aha, a-a-aha, my little one.</poem>\n\nIn June 2007 this production made its European premi\u00e8re at De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam. It then opened in December 2007 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, again directed by Sellars, with Finley and Owens reprising their roles. Adams and Sellars made \"some significant changes\" to the opera and production in response to feedback from the San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Chicago productions.\n\nA new production of the opera, directed by the film director Penny Woolcock and conducted by Alan Gilbert, was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in October 2008 and was part of the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD series on November 8, 2008. The assistant conductor for this production was also Donato Cabrera. The HD video of the production was later televised nationally on PBS as well, in the \"Great Performances at the Met\" series. On January 17, 2009, the Met production of the opera was heard on NPR as part of the Saturday afternoon Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. Penny Woolcock's production was restaged by the English National Opera in London, February 25 to March 20, 2009 with Gerald Finley reprising his portrayal of the lead.\n\nAdams had written the role of Kitty Oppenheimer for the mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. However, she was unable to commit to the project due to her health (she died soon after the work premiered). The work was sung in the world premiere by mezzo Kristine Jepson. For the second major production, at De Nederlandse Opera, Adams reworked the role for a soprano, Jessica Rivera. For the Metropolitan Opera Premiere, the role was again sung by a mezzo, Sasha Cooke.\n\nIn 2007, Adams adapted the opera into the \"Doctor Atomic Symphony\". Music was taken from the overture, various interludes and orchestral settings were made of arias like Oppenheimer's signature \"Batter My Heart.\" The work was first premiered by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and conducted by the composer on August 21, 2007, at a BBC Proms concert. The work was later performed at Carnegie Hall in Spring 2008. Originally composed in four movements and lasting 45 minutes, the symphony was revised by Adams to just three movements (played without a break) and 25 minutes' length. This version was recorded in 2008 by the St. Louis Symphony, conducted by David Robertson and released by Nonesuch Records on July 20, 2009.\n\n\n\n"

In experiments he coated it on plates of glass, zinc, copper and silver-surfaced copper, pewter and lithographic stone, and found it resisted dissolution in oil of lavender and petroleum, so that the uncoated shadow areas could be traditionally treated through acid etching and aquatint to print black ink. \n\nThe exposed and solvent-treated plate itself, as in the case of \"View from the Window at Le Gras,\" presents a negative or positive image dependent upon ambient reflection, not unlike the daguerreotype which was based on Ni\u00e9pce's discoveries.\n\nBitumen has a complex and varied structure of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (linked benzene rings), containing a small proportion of nitrogen and sulphur; its hardening in proportion to its exposure to light is understood to be due to further cross-linking of the rings, as is the hardening of tree resins (colophony, or abietic acid) by light, first noted by Jean Senebier in 1782. The photochemistry of these processes, which has been studied by Jean-Louis Marignier of Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud since the 1990s, is still to be fully understood.\n\nThe word has also been used to refer to other phenomena: for description of the sun (cf. geography), for photography in general, for signalling by heliograph (a device less commonly called a heliotrope or helio-telegraph), and for photography \"of\" the sun.\n\nThe abbreviations \"h\u00e9liog.\" or \"h\u00e9liogr.\", found on old reproductions, may stand for the French word \"h\u00e9liogravure\", and can then refer to any form of photogravure.\n\n"

The Greek word olethros is found in the Holy Scriptures in 1 Corinthians 5:5; 1 Thessalonians 5:3; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; and 1 Timothy 6:9 and is translated \"destruction\" in most Bibles.

    "title": "Ferro Carril Oeste",
    "text": "Club Ferro Carril Oeste, known simply as Ferro Carril Oeste or Ferro, is an Argentine sports club from the neighbourhood of Caballito, Buenos Aires. Although many activities are hosted by the club, Ferro is mostly known for its\nfootball team, currently playing in the Primera B Nacional, the second division of the Argentine football league system.\n\nApart from football, Ferro Carril Oeste hosts a wide variety of sports that can be practised at the club, such as athletics, basketball, baseball, futsal, handball, field hockey, swimming, taekwondo, tennis, table tennis and volleyball.\n\nAlways located in Caballito, the club was founded as \"Club Atl\u00e9tico del Ferrocarril Oeste de Buenos Aires\" on 28 July 1904, by a hundred employees of the Buenos Aires Western Railway (then Ferrocarril Domingo Faustino Sarmiento). The club was approved and supported by railway managers, so Ferro soon incorporated lands to build its headquarters and sports installations. In 1907, Ferro joined the amateur second division, and in 1912 the team won the promotion to the first division after beating Racing Club in the final game.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s, the club emancipated from the railway company, changing its name to \"Club Ferro Carril Oeste\". In 1937 five talented players rose from the youth divisions, forming an offensive line which would be remembered as \"The Five Musketeers\". They were Bernardo Gandulla, Juan Jos\u00e9 Maril, Luis Borgnia, Jaime Sarlanga and Ra\u00fal Emeal. But those skilled players only played together between 1937 and 1938, due to other clubs acquiring them (Sarlanga would have a memorable run with Boca Juniors). Both Gandulla and Sarlanga together scored more than the 50% of the goals scored by Ferro in the 1937 season\n\nOther notable player for the club was Delf\u00edn Ben\u00edtez C\u00e1ceres, who played from 1941 until his retirement in 1944 scoring 20 goals. Gandulla and Emeal returned to Ferro in 1944 after their stint with Boca Juniors. But despite having such prominent players, Ferro finished last in 1946 season and was relegated to Second Division for the first time in its history.\n\nFerro soon returned to the first division in 1949, when winning the Primera B title. During the 1950 Ferro finished 6th in 1954 and reached a memorable 4th position in 1959, the best team campaign until then. After being relegated again, Ferro won the Primera B championship in 1963, returning to Primera Divisi\u00f3n. In the top level, Ferro reached another 4th place in the 1965 tournament. Ferro would be relegated again, returning in 1970 to the first division.\nIn 1974 Ferro wore an orange jersey, paying tribute to World sub-champion Netherlands national football team, \"The Clockwork Orange\", finishing 6th in the Torneo Nacional disputed that year. Team's most notable player was central midfielder Ger\u00f3nimo \"Cacho\" Saccardi, who had debuted in 1969 and became a legendary player for the institution.\n\nFerro had a prominent role in Argentine sports in the 1980s, more specifically in football and basketball. The football team won 2 titles of Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n and played the Copa Libertadores. Otherwise, the basketball team won the Liga Nacional de B\u00e1squet (the Argentine first division league) championship 3 times.\n\nIn 1979 Carlos Griguol arrived to the club. He later became the most successful coach in the club's history, winning 2 Primera Divisi\u00f3n titles for the first time and also promoting to Primera players such as Alberto M\u00e1rcico, H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper and Oscar Garr\u00e9. In 1981 Ferro finished 2nd, totalling 49 points, just one less than champion Boca Juniors. That same year Ferro reached the Torneo Nacional final although the team was defeated by River Plate (by the same score: 1\u20130 in the two matches played).\nFerro finally won its first title at Primera in 1982, obtaining the Torneo Nacional defeating Quilmes in the finals. The squad played 22 matches, won 16 and tied 6. Ferro scored 50 goals and conceded 13. Left wing Miguel Angel Ju\u00e1rez was the top scorer with 22. Other notable players for the champion team were Adolfino Ca\u00f1ete, Alberto M\u00e1rcico, Juan Domingo Rocchia and H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper.\n\nAlthough some important players during the 1982 tournament had left (Saccardi, Rocchia, Crocco), Ferro won another Torneo Nacional in 1984, defeating River Plate (with Norberto Alonso and Enzo Francescoli) in the finals (3\u20130 and 1\u20130). The team played 14 matches, winning 8 and losing only 1, with 5 draws. Ferro scored 32 goals and only conceded 9, being M\u00e1rcico the top scorer with 5 goals.\n\nAnother important achievement for Ferro was the 2nd place in the 1984 Torneo Metropolitano, finishing with 50 points, only one less than champion Argentinos Juniors. Ferro also played the 1985 Copa Libertadores, being eliminated in the first round by Argentinos Juniors.\n\nBut Ferro not only won 2 titles in first division, but also set three notable records in the Argentine Primera:\n\nOn the other hand, Ferro has the longest run without scoring a goal. The team went 875 minutes without scoring between the end of the 1998 Apertura and the 1999 Clausura.\n\nIn 1987 Carlos Griguol left the club, and was hired by River Plate. He had won 2 titles in the first division (who still are the only two championships won by Ferro at the top level of Argentine football) and 2 sub-championships. Griguol returned in 1988, coaching Ferro until 1993.\n\nIn 1990's Ferro's form gradually declined and relegated to third level in 2001 after two consecutive relegations. Ferro finally returned to second one in 2003.\n\nFerro has a strong rivalry with V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield, so both teams disputed what is known as \"Cl\u00e1sico del Oeste\".\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1squez Mujica (28 November 1916 \u2013 24 June 2014) was a Venezuelan political figure. He served as President of Venezuela between 1993 and 1994. He was an important historian, journalist, lawyer and politician.\n\nVel\u00e1squez was born in T\u00e1chira, on 28 November 1916. His parents were Ramon Velasquez Ordo\u00f1ez, a journalist and proofreader for a newspaper and educator Regina Mujica. For his initial studies he was home schooled by his parents in his hometown. He completed his primary education in San Crist\u00f3bal Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. In 1935 he traveled to Caracas to finish high school at the Liceo Andres Bello. Velasquez undertook his higher education at the Central University of Venezuela, from which he received a PhD in Social and Political Sciences in 1942 and a Law degree in 1943.\n\nVel\u00e1squez became a reporter for \"\u00daltimas Noticias\" in 1941.\nVel\u00e1squez was the president of \"El Nacional\" on two occasions (1964-1968/1979-1981).\n\nAs a historian, he had previously subscribed to the usual negative opinions of the Venezuelan dictator Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez, but re-examined them in \"Confidencias imaginarias de Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez\" (1979). (When he became President, he presided over a ceremony renaming Juan Vicente G\u00f3mez International Airport in G\u00f3mez' honour.) He authored numerous books on Venezuela's political history, being generally considered in his lifetime as Venezuela's foremost Historian. He was President of the National Academy of History.\n\nDuring the dictatorship of Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez, Vel\u00e1squez was jailed for a year for his role at the compilation of the \"Libro negro de la dictadura\" (Black book of dictatorship). The files of this book helped expose the crimes of the dictatorial period.\n\nIn 1958, as Venezuela transitioned to democracy, Vel\u00e1squez was elected to the Venezuelan Senate for the state of Tachira, and later to the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies for the state of Miranda.\n\nHe served as Secretary General (Chief of Staff) of the Presidency during the government of R\u00f3mulo Betancourt. After that, he was part of the National Congress. During Rafael Caldera's Presidential administration, Vel\u00e1squez served as Minister of Communications from 1969 until 1971. From 1984 to 1987 he was President of the Comisi\u00f3n para la Reforma del Estado (COPRE), the Commission on the Reform of the State. Between 1989 and 1993, he chaired the \"Comisi\u00f3n Presidencial para Asuntos Fronterizos con Colombia\", Presidential Commission for border issues with Colombia (COPAF). At the time of his death, he was a board member of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation.\n\nIn 1993, as a result of the crisis produced by the impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez, Congress appointed Vel\u00e1squez President of the Republic, finishing the constitutional period in 1994. He served from 5 June 1993 to 2 February 1994. As a highly respected national figure there was general consensus around his name for such a task. In August Vel\u00e1squez held an emergency meeting to respond to the tropical storm Bret's heavy damage that leaves at least 70 dead. About 1,400\u00a0workers and volunteers helped in rescue efforts after the mudslides struck Caracas and surrounding areas, assisted by Red Cross volunteers and 800\u00a0firefighters. Storm victims were temporarily housed at the Fuerte Tiuna army base. Roads were quickly cleared of debris and mud, although many were not reopened initially due to the threat for additional mudslides. \nThe government was overshadowed by the so-called \" narcoindulto \" to trafficker Larry Tovar Acu\u00f1a, in this case the Private Secretariat of the Presidency obtained irregularly signed by the President for the release to a known drug dealer. Other events under his brief government include the bankruptcy of Banco Latino with subsequent leakage of foreign currency abroad and .\nAmong his governmental measures was the introduction of Value Added Tax as part of the Enabling Act entrusted to the National Congress.\n\nIn 1948, Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Vel\u00e1squez married Ligia Betancourt Mari\u00f1o (1920 \u2013 14 July 2008) who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1993\u20131994. On 24 June 2014 Vel\u00e1squez died at the age of 97 from natural causes. He died 5 weeks after former President Jaime Lusinchi did on 21 May 2014.\n\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Chinese Cambodian",
    "text": "Chinese Cambodians or Sino-Khmers, are Cambodian citizens of Chinese or partial Chinese descent. The Khmer term \"Khmer kat Chen\" () is used for people of mixed Cambodian and Chinese descent while \"Khmer Chen\" () can mean Cambodian-born citizen of Chinese ancestry. Khmer people constitute the largest ethnic group in Cambodia among whom \"Chen\" means \"Chinese\". Contact with ethnic Chinese people such as envoys, merchants, travelers and diplomats who regularly visited Indochina verifiably existed since the beginning of the common era. However the earliest record of an ethnic Chinese community in Cambodia dates to the 13th century. As a result of a century-long settlement history people with mixed Chinese and Khmer ancestry account for a sizable portion of the population.\n\nChinese Cambodians also play a leading role in Cambodia's business sector and dominate the Cambodian economy today. In addition, Chinese Cambodians have a strong presence in Cambodia's political scene with many high ranking government officials and much of the political elite being of partial Chinese descent.\n\nThe earliest records of Chinese settlement dates back to the late 13th century. Yuan emissary Zhou Daguan visited Cambodia in 1296 and authored his detailed and comprehensive \"Record of Cambodia\" in which he mentions the presence of Chinese residents at Angkor. Portuguese seafarers noted the presence of a Chinese settlement in Phnom Penh in the early 17th century. Around the same time Lim To Khieng, a Chinese privateer made similar observation during his stay in Cambodia while trading and conducting sea raids. Shortly after the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, Chinese troops under the command of Mac Cuu and Duong Ngan Dich encouraged large numbers of refugees from Fujian and Guangdong provinces to settle in Indochina. The majority of the immigrants were men who eventually married local Khmer women. Their descendants usually assimilated smoothly into the local communities, the economic and social process and personally identified as Cambodians. However, customs were also imported, such as the practice of the Chinese topknot that was practiced until the 18th century.\n\nThe French first introduced a legislation in 1873 which classified Chinese immigrants as 'Alien Asians' and subjects were subjected to resident taxes. King Norodom introduced a legislative reform in 1884 which required the Chinese immigrants to pay higher resident taxes but there were no legal restrictions imposed for immigrants to take up Cambodian citizenship. In 1891, the French introduced a legislation first introduced by Gia Long in Cochinchina, called \"bang\" in Chinese. Five associations were established in Cambodia, each identified by their specific region of ancestral origin in China; Cantonese, Hokkien, Hainanese, Teochew and Hakka. Chinese immigrants were required to register with their association to settle in Cambodia. Each of these associations were led by an elected headman, who would be responsible for maintaining law, order and tax collection duties from their countrymen.\n\nThe French system of administering the Chinese Cambodian community was terminated in 1958. During the 1960s, Chinese community affairs tended to be handled, at least in Phnom Penh, by the Chinese Hospital Committee, an organization set up to fund and to administer a hospital established earlier for the Chinese community.\n\nThis committee was the largest association of Chinese merchants in the country, and it was required by the organization's constitution to include on its fifteen-member board six people from the Teochew group, three from the Cantonese, two from the Hokkien, two from the Hakka, and two from the Hainanese. The hospital board constituted the recognized leadership of Phnom Penh's Chinese community. Local Chinese school boards in the smaller cities and towns often served a similar function.\n\nThis was to be a high point in terms of the rights of the Chinese minorities. Cambodian independence in 1953 saw a regression in their treatment by state authorities and the previously existing autonomy was eliminated by the new government. However, many private associations - cultural, business-oriented and to do with education - were simply continued by the Chinese communities and clan associations themselves, as these communities still had very significant economic and political power. Anti-Chinese feeling and policies emerged, however, after the coup of 1970 which saw the establishing of a pro-West government which considered the neighbouring People's Republic of China a dangerous threat - and the Chinese minorities in Cambodia as a possible fifth column.\n\nThe year 1970 thus marks the beginning of almost two decades of severe repression of the Chinese minorities in Cambodia. It was after this point that Cambodian authorities started forcing the closure of Chinese schools and newspapers, requiring the Chinese to carry special identity papers, imposing special taxes on the Chinese and moving towards denying them Cambodian citizenship. While the Khmer Rouge regime appeared to have a more \u2018tolerant' ethnic policy initially, it continued to discriminate against the Chinese once it had completed its takeover of Cambodia. The continued discrimination, however, now rested on class rather than ethnic grounds; since the majority of urban Chinese were traders, they were classified as \u2018capitalists' by the revolutionary regime. While there is no evidence that the Chinese were particularly targeted in the Khmer Rouge purges, their population in Cambodia was probably reduced by half in the four years of Khmer Rouge rule; it seems that there was an increased number of anti-Chinese events just prior to the Vietnamese invasion which brought an end to the Pol Pot regime.\n\nThe establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea after the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 was not completely positive for the Chinese minorities. Partly because of tensions between China and Vietnam, the new Cambodian authorities adopted restrictive measures against the remaining members of the Chinese minorities, including banning them from returning to urban trades.\n\nIn 1971 the government authorized the formation of a new body, the Federated Association of Chinese of Cambodia, which was the first organization to embrace all of Cambodia's resident Chinese. According to its statutes, the federation was designed to \"aid Chinese nationals in the social, cultural, public health, and medical fields,\" to administer the property owned jointly by the Chinese community in Phnom Penh and elsewhere, and to promote friendly relations between Cambodians and Chinese.\n\nWith leadership that could be expected to include the recognized leaders of the national Chinese community, the federation was believed likely to continue the trend, evident since the early 1960s, to transcend dialect group allegiance in many aspects of its social, political, and economic programs.\n\nGenerally, relations between the Chinese and the ethnic Khmer were good. There was some intermarriage, and a sizable proportion of the population in Cambodia was part Sino-Khmer, who were assimilated easily into either the Chinese or the Khmer community. Willmott assumes that a Sino-Khmer elite dominated commerce in Cambodia from the time of independence well into the era of the Khmer Republic.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge takeover was catastrophic for the Chinese community for several reasons. When the Khmer Rouge took over a town, they immediately disrupted the local market. According to Willmott, this disruption virtually eliminated retail trade \"and the traders (almost all Chinese) became indistinguishable from the unpropertied urban classes.\"\n\nThe Chinese, in addition to having their livelihood eradicated on the whole, also suffered because of their socioeconomic class. They were mainly well-educated urban merchants, and thus were characteristic of the people whom the Khmer Rouge detested. Chinese refugees have reported that they shared the same brutal treatment as other urban Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge r\u00e9gime but they were not discriminated against as an ethnic group until after the Vietnamese invasion due to the PRC's support of the Khmer Rouge. Several of the most senior members of the Khmer Rouge were themselves of partial Chinese descent, such as Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan, Kang Kek Iew, Son Sen, Ta Mok and even Pol Pot himself. King Sihanouk saw the delineation and repression of Chinese business and identity as nationalism emerged and the Chinese were perceived as threatening to Cambodian sovereignty. During the various regimes between 1970 and 1990, Chinese enterprise and cultural expression was completely banned and destroyed and many ethnic Chinese died or fled the country.\n\nFollowing the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the fall of Democratic Kampuchea, the new pro-Hanoi People's Republic of Kampuchea regime lifted some of the oppressive rules imposed on ethnic Chinese by the Khmer Rouge government. Chinese newspapers were allowed and the ban on speaking Chinese at home was lifted. However, partial restrictions and a certain amount of suspicion remained, for the pro-Soviet PRK regime resented China's support for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas fighting against it, now renamed as the \"National Army of Democratic Kampuchea\" (NADK). Observers at the time believed that the lingering anti-Chinese stance of the PRK government and of its officials in Phnom Penh made it unlikely that a Chinese community of the same scale as before the Khmer Rouge could resurface in Cambodia in the near future.\n\nThe conditions for the ethnic Chinese, however, improved greatly under the SOC, the transitional avatar of the PRK after 1989. Restrictions placed on them by the former PRK gradually disappeared. The State of Cambodia allowed ethnic Chinese to observe their particular religious customs and Chinese language schools were reopened. In 1991, two years after the SOC's foundation, the Chinese New Year was officially celebrated in Cambodia for the first time since 1975.\n\nOf particular note is China's economic role in the country, which encouraged Sino-Khmer businessmen to reestablish their past business which were once suppressed by the Khmer Rouge. The modern Cambodian economy is highly dependent on Sino-Khmer companies who controlled a large stake in the country's economy, and their support is enhanced by the large presence of lawmakers who are of at least part-Chinese ancestry themselves.\n\nThe Chinese language study is increasing in Phnom Penh, with the subject recently added to the national curriculum at the university level. Many Cambodians of ethnic Chinese descent learn Chinese for employment as well as business reasons due to the fact as many Mainland Chinese investors are investing across the Cambodian economy.\n\nThe position of the Chinese minority has undergone a dramatic turn for the better and the Chinese seem to have regained much of their previous economic clout. For various reasons, including the growing economic collaboration between China and Cambodia and the huge investments being made by Chinese companies, the Chinese community has seen its numbers expand dramatically in the 2000s (decade). There has been a huge growth in Chinese-language schools, often generously supported by the government of China through subsidies, and also in the production of textbooks (in Chinese) that incorporate Cambodian history and seminars for teachers. There may be close to 100 such schools today (2007). One of these private schools claims to be the largest overseas Chinese school in the world, with some 10,000 students. A number of Chinese-language newspapers began to be published in the country after 1993, and state television broadcasting even included a news segment in Chinese after 1998. All of the main political parties in Cambodia now appear sensitive to the clout of the Chinese minority, publishing campaign material in Chinese in the last elections. While this minority faced serious discrimination until the 1980s, it appears that that period has come to an end and that they no longer appear to be victimized by state authorities and are allowed to prosper under Hun Sen.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Ministry of Planning by the Cambodian government, approximately 15,000 individuals, or 0.1% out of the country's total population of 15 million were identified as ethnic Chinese in 2013. A year later, Chinese associations in Phnom Penh estimates that around 700,000 Cambodians have at least some Chinese ancestry. A government census done in 1962 showed that 163,000 individuals Cambodian nationals were registered as Chinese, which amounted to as much as 3% of the country's population. The ECCC had noted that then-Prince Sihanouk had estimated the Chinese population in Cambodia made up of 300,000 to 435,000 individuals in 1965, while CIA had estimated that there were about 444,000 Chinese in 1975. A University field study conducted by William Willmott in 1961 found that there were 425,000 Chinese in Cambodia, which made up to approximately 7.4% of the total population at that time. Willmott noted that there is a tendency for some Chinese who have taken up Cambodian citizenship, or Chinese descendants who have assimilated into Khmer society through intermarriages to be identified as Khmer in government censuses. During the late 1960s and early 1970s the approximately 425,000 Chinese Cambodians represented the largest ethnic minority in Cambodia. However, this number had fallen to a mere 61,400 by 1984. This rapid decline has been attributed to the accumulation of causes like warfare, economic stagnation, the Khmer Rouge era and periods of different regime caused mass-emigration.\n\nOfficial censuses between 2004 and 2008 recorded that Chinese consisted of 0.3% of the country's total urban population and are concentrated mostly in Phnom Penh, while Chinese fluctuated between 0.0% and 0.1% of the country's total rural population between 2004 and 2013. Willmott's study of Chinese in Cambodia's urban and rural areas in 1963 recorded that 59% of the Chinese lived in cities and towns while 41% lived in the countryside. Phnom Penh had a Chinese population of 135,000, or about one-third (33.5%) the city's total population.\n\nThe Teochew people make up the largest Chinese sub-group in Cambodia and make up about 77% of the Chinese population. About 85% of the Teochews in Cambodia came from the prefectures of Jieyang and Shantou of Guangdong province in China. The earliest records of Teochew immigrants date back to the 16th century when some mutineers under the leadership of the Chinese pirate, Lim To Khieng settled in Cambodia. No significant of Chinese immigration from the Chaoshan region occurred until the 1860s, and the Teochews came to Cambodia in modest numbers in the later part of the 19th century. Large-scale immigration occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, and the Teochews established themselves as the dominant Chinese sub-group thereafter. Approximately 48% of the Teochews live in rural area, and they made up about 90% of the rural Chinese population. The Teochews is also the largest sub-group in Cambodia, where some 100,000 out of 135,000 Chinese in 1962 are from this sub-group. Teochews in rural region of the country generally make their living as village shopkeepers, rural credit moneylenders, rice merchants or as vegetable farmers. In Phnom Penh and the smaller towns, the Teochews are generally import-export Entrepot traders, pharmacists or street peddlars.\n\nThe large influx of Teochew immigrants from Thailand into Battambang resulted in the Teochews outnumbering other Chinese dialect groups in the city following its brief annexation by Thailand in 1945 that brought large numbers of Teochew immigrants to move into the city. By the 1960s, the Teochew dialect became the main language of commerce communication usage in the city.\n\nNumerous Chinese Cambodian political leaders, entrepreneurs and community figures are of Teochew descent:\n\n- Lao Meng Khin (\u5218\u660e\u52e4): Chairman of Pheapimex Group, Senator and member of the governing Cambodian People's Party\n\n- Pung Kheav Se (\u65b9\u4fa8\u751f): Co-founder and Chairman of Canadia Bank, and Economic Advisor to Prime Minister Hun Sen\n\n- Yang Qi Chiew (\u6768\u542f\u79cb): Chinese Cambodian entrepreneur and community figure. Permanent Honorary Chairman of the Federation of Khmer Chinese in Cambodia\n\nThe Cantonese are also known as \"Chen-Catung\" in Khmer language. They made up the largest Chinese sub-group in Cambodia between the 17th century until the early 20th century. lived mainly in the city. About 40% of the Cantonese are concentrated in Phnom Penh, while most of the remainder are found in Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang and Kratie where they make up at least 30% of the Chinese populace. About 55% of the Cantonese came from the prefectures of Dongguan, Guangzhou and Foshan in the Guangdong province of China. In the 1880s and 1890s, Chinese real estate developers of Cantonese origin secured building contracts from the French colonial government, to develop brick-and-concrete shophouses in a programme of urban renewal of modernizing Phnom Penh. The Cantonese, who comprised the majority of Chinese Cambodians before the Teochew migrations began in the late 1930s, lived mainly in the city. Typically, the Cantonese engaged in transportation and in the skilled construction trades mainly as mechanics or carpenters.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the Hainanese people traced their origins from Wenchang county. People from Hainan settled in Cambodia from the early 18th century under M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu, who established a trading settlement that spanned modern-day Ha Tien, Kampot province and Sihanoukville. Early Hainanese settlers started off as entrepot traders but turned to pepper trading at the end of the 18th century. They established pepper plantations in Kampot, and became the dominant Chinese sub-group in that province. Smaller Hainanese communities are also found at Sisophon and Sre Ambel. In the 1950s, many Hainanese would then move to Phnom Penh, where, in the late 1960s, they monopolized the city's entire hotel and restaurant business. Hainanese of more humbler socioeconomic backgrounds operated tailor shops and haberdasheries. \n\nSeveral prominent Chinese Cambodian tycoons and entrepreneurs are of Hainanese descent: \n\n- Hann Khieng (\u97e9\u5f3a\u7574): Chairman of the Cambodian Petrochemical Company (CPC).\n\n- Ly Yong Phat (\u674e\u6c38\u6cd5): President and CEO of L.Y.P Group, and Special Economic Adviser to Prime Minister Hun Sen.\n\n- Phu Kok An (\u7b26\u56fd\u5b89): President of Anco Brothers Co.\n\n- Sy Kong Triv (\u5f90\u5149\u79c0): President of KT Pacific Group.\n\nThe Hokkien sub-group were believed to be the earliest Chinese sub-group to settle in Cambodia. Most of the Hokkiens trace their ancestry back to Quanzhou and Xiamen prefectures in southern Fujian province. The Hokkiens settle mainly in Phnom Penh and Battambang, and many Khmer families in Battambang claimed to have some distant Hokkien Chinese ancestry.\nThe Hokkien community is involved the import-export shipping trade and in banking. They also comprised a large percentage of the country's richest Chinese.\n\nAbout 65% of the Hakka trace their roots back to Meizhou and Heyuan prefectures in Guangdong province. About 70% of the Hakkas are found in Phnom Penh where they are dominant professions in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and shoemaking. Hakkas are also found in Takeo province, Stung Treng and Rattanakiri who consist of vegetable farmers and rubber plantation workers. Hakka communities in the provinces migrated to Cambodia through Tonkin and Cochinchina in the 18th and 19th centuries. In Phnom Penh, the newly-arrived Hakka were typically folk dentists, sellers of traditional Chinese medicines, and shoemakers.\n\nMany Chinese Cambodian families have their children learn Chinese to reaffirm their Chinese identity as Mandarin has been increasingly the primary language of business for Overseas Chinese business communities. One main factor is due to the rise of China's global economic prominence and many Chinese Cambodian business families see Mandarin as a beneficial asset to partake economic links to conduct business between Cambodia and Mainland China.\n\nChinese Cambodians are generally practitioners of Chinese folk religion, which incorporates rituals associated with Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism. Most Chinese families maintain a small shrine dedicated to at least one or more legendary or historical figure, and popular choices include Kitchen God, Guan Yu, Guan Yin, Matsu and Wang Ye. During festive occasions such as Chinese New Year, Chinese Cambodians would pray at communal temples either individually or as a group. Joss sticks and paper as well as food offerings are used for prayers. On certain occasions such as funerals or fortune-telling, Chinese Cambodians would approach spirit mediums and geomancers.\n\nA small minority of Chinese Cambodians follow mainstream Mahayana Buddhism of the Chan denomination. Chinese Cambodian families generally do not practice Theravada Buddhism and send their children to Khmer monasteries, except for those descendants who have assimilated into mainstream Khmer society. In the 1990s and 2000s, there exists a trend among assimilated Sino-Khmer silk merchants who maintain commercial links with Chinese businessmen to re-adopt Chinese cultural and religious practices. They maintain Chinese shrines in their homes and shops, and explained that the adoption of such practices are necessary to forge closer ties with Mainland and Overseas Chinese businessmen.\n\nLike much of Southeast Asia, ethnic Chinese dominate Cambodian commerce at every level of society. Entrepreneurial savvy Chinese have literally taken over Cambodia's entire economy. Ethnic Chinese wield tremendous economic clout over their indigenous Khmer majority counterparts and play a critical role in maintaining the country's economic vitality and prosperity. The ethnic Chinese community is one of the most socioeconomically and politically influential and powerful communities in Cambodia. The community dominates the entire Cambodian business sector and is economically prosperous relative to their indigenous Khmer counterparts. With their powerful economic prominence, the Chinese virtually make up the country's entire wealthy elite. Within this structure, Cambodia as a plural society where one's place in the economic structure depends on one's ethnic background. Furthermore, the Chinese Cambodians \"not only form a distinct ethnic community, they also form, by and large, an economic class: the commercial middle and upper class in contrast to the poorer indigenous Khmer majority working and underclass, who have traditionally looked down on commerce.\n\nChinese economic dominance of Cambodia dates back the pre-French colonial kingdoms where Chinese merchants often maintained patron-client relationships with the Khmer monarchy. William Willmot, a Sinologist at the University of British Columbia estimates that 90 percent of the Chinese in Cambodia were involved in commerce in 1963. Playing a crucial economic role in the country, the Chinese control almost all of Cambodia's internal trade and substantial portion of the manufacturing including rice-milling and transportation sectors. Today, an estimated 60 percent are urban dwellers engaging in commerce while the rest of the rural population work as shopkeepers, processors of food products (such as rice, palm sugar, fruit, and fish), and moneylenders. Throughout Cambodian cities, Chinese dominated numerous industries such as retail, hospitality, export-import trade, light, food processing, soft drinks, printing and machine shops. In addition, virtually all of Cambodia's richest people are of Chinese descent. Rural Chinese businessmen operated general shops that provided ethnic Khmer peasants with essential purchases such as farming supplies, groceries imported from China, sampots and sarongs, bamboo baskets, perfume, kerosene for lamps, alcohol as well as tobacco. Those in the Kampot Province and parts of Kaoh Kong Province cultivate black pepper and fruit (especially rambutans, durians, and coconuts). Additionally, rural Chinese Cambodians also engaged in salt water fishing. In the 19th century, French colonials allowed Chinese-run businesses to flourish due to their laissez faire capitalist policies. Willmott estimated that the ethnic Chinese controlled 92 percent of the Cambodian economy by the mid-20th century. They traded in urban areas and worked as shopkeepers, moneylenders and traditional healers in rural areas, while Chinese farmers controlled Cambodia's lucrative Kampot pepper industry. Chinese Cambodian moneylenders wield considerable economic power over the poorer indigenous ethnic Khmer peasants through usury at an interest rate of 10 to 20 percent per month. This might have been the reason why seventy-five percent of the peasants in Cambodia were in debt in 1952, according to the Australian Colonial Credit Office. Chinese Cambodian entrepreneurs are also estimated to control 70 percent of the industrial investment and are actively engaged in trading, real estate development, construction, small-scale manufacturing, alcohol distilling, hospitality, fast food restaurants, and food processing. Ethnic Chinese also dominate the silk weaving industry where key commercial positions in the Cambodian silk trading networks are completely held in Chinese hands.\n\nCambodia's rice milling industry is completely under Chinese hands and wield a complete monopoly on rice distilling. At the turn of the 20th century, Cambodia's rice mills was completely controlled by the Chinese and was responsible for the nation's entire export of rice. Hierarchies of rice mills were established ranging from the small humble rural rice dealer all the way to the colossal Cholon style rice mills. Many shopkeepers also mixed and diversified other services of value such as lending money and retailing manufactured goods in addition to rice trading. Despite constituting less than 1 percent of the overall population of Cambodia, ethnic Chinese are estimated to control 70 percent of the publicly listed companies on the Cambodian stock exchange. Of the 346 shipping firms listed in the 1963 issue of the Chinese Commercial Annual, a minimum of 267 or 78 percent were owned by Chinese Cambodians with the eight of the top ten businesses being owned by Sino-Khmers. The remainder were either French or state owned but economic preponderance prompted ethnic Chinese businessmen to act as financial intermediaries operating as agents for the French as well as their own. In addition, Chinese investment in Cambodia was second to the French prior to the Second Sino-Japanese war. 95 percent of the internal trade was also under control of the Chinese. Of the 3349 industrial firms listed by the Cambodian Ministry of Industry in 1961, 3300 or 99 percent were controlled by the Chinese with the rest being either state owned or by French interests. Chinese representation of the 3300 strong firms was 90 percent of the total private investment in the aggregate. Industrial firms range from artisan work shops, small scale manufacturing, foodstuff (dry ice, soda pop, or soy sauce) and primary processing of saw milling, rice milling, sugar refining and charcoal burning. Since 1995, Chinese Cambodians have reestablished themselves as the dominant economic players since the fall of the Khmer Rouge by controlling Cambodia's entire import-export shipping, banking, hotel, gold and rice trading, garments, industrial manufacturing and real estate sectors. Market reforms during the mid-1980s have attracted a large contingent of wealthy Overseas Chinese entrepreneurs looking to exploit opportunities in Cambodian property development and general trading.\n\nEthnic Chinese are responsible for pioneering the development of the country's entire small, medium, and large enterprise sector by setting up trading and production firms, restaurants, and stores, as well as establishing virtually all of the country's politically well-connected business groups. Utilizing the bamboo network business model, ethnic Chinese businesses are structured as family businesses, trust-based networks, and patronage arrangements with a centralized bureaucracy. Moreover, social mechanisms that underpin these entrepreneurial trajectories largely derive from family, ethnic, cultural, and patron-client ties based on personalized and informal trust. Confucian Chinese business practices and societal discourses that link \u201cChineseness\u201d are stereo-typically linked to economic success which is omnipresent in contemporary Cambodia. Ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs continue to remain the driving force behind the modern Cambodian economy with many of them having relatives in government through political connections and business networks in the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce, which is predominantly made up of ethnic Chinese themselves. Entrepreneurial networks, Chinese family clan associations, Chambers of Commerce with business resources are found across the country to assist aspiring Chinese Cambodian entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the opening up of China's global prominence in the world economy has induced the resurrection of ties between the ethnic Chinese in Cambodia and their ancestral homeland in Mainland China.\n\nToday, Cambodia's ethnic Chinese are now at the forefront of opening up the country's economy as an international Overseas Chinese economic outpost. Much of the foreign investment now entering Cambodia is being channeled through Overseas Chinese bamboo networks. Many members of the Chinese Cambodian business community often act as agents for expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese investors outside of Cambodia. Of particular note is Mainland China's economic role in the country, which has emerged to become a dominant foreign player in Cambodia. China's source of external influence in the Cambodian economy has encouraged Chinese Cambodian businessmen to reestablish their past businesses and regain their lost property which were once confiscated by the Khmer Rouge. The modern Cambodian business sector is highly dependent on ethnic Chinese companies who control virtually the country's entire economy and their support is enhanced by the large presence of lawmakers and politicians whom are of at least part-Chinese themselves. Cambodia's lack of an indigenous Khmer commercial culture in the private sector that is dominated entirely by Chinese Cambodians, has encouraged a plethora of Mainland Chinese foreign investment capital into the country. From 1994 to July 2011, Mainland China invested more than US$8.8 billion across the country. The Cambodian government has made efforts to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in investments from Mainland China and Overseas Chinese businessmen as well as marketing the nation's tourism industry to potential Mainland Chinese clients. In addition, Mainland Chinese expatriate entrepreneurs and investors have been coming to Cambodia to acquire Cambodian assets and have invested substantial amounts of capital across the Cambodian economy channeling their financial capital through bamboo networks. The Cambodian Chinese business community has been backed by the Cambodian political elite as much of the country depends on ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs and the pouring of Mainland Chinese investment capital for job creation has added to the globalized value added investment chain in the country. The CPP itself has incorporated many ethnic Chinese who provide financial support to the party with many high government officials and other major political decision-makers being of partial Chinese descent. The position of the Chinese minority has undergone a dramatic turn for the better and the Chinese seem to have regained much of their previous economic clout. The influx of Chinese capital has led to a resurgence of Chinese cultural pride among the Chinese Cambodian community while concurrently creating new jobs and economic niches. Following the transition of Cambodia from socialism to market-driven state-owned capitalist principles, Cambodia's Chinese community began to reassert their cultural identity and economic clout. This reassertion of Chinese identity has blossomed into confident displays of Han Chinese ethnic pride following the influx of Mainland Chinese investment into Cambodia. Since 1990, Cambodia witnessed a rebirth of Han Chinese cultural expression and business boom across the country. Regional trade networks were restored and small and medium-sized businesses have flourished since the introduction of market-driven state-owned capitalist principles in the country. The growing economic collaboration between China and Cambodia and the huge investments being made by Overseas and Mainland Chinese companies in the country have led the Chinese Cambodian community to see its numbers expand dramatically since the turn of the 21st century.\n\nThe 21st-century Chinese Cambodian community remains a modern well established commercial middle and upper class group. The community remains an insular and tight-knit group that has integrated well into local Cambodian society becoming a stereotypical trope representing socioeconomic success and extreme wealth. As ethnic Chinese economic might grew, Cambodian hill tribes and aborigines were gradually driven out into poorer land on the hills, on the rural outskirts of major Cambodian cities or into the mountains. The increased resurgence of Chinese cultural and economic activity in 21st-century Cambodia has triggered distrust, resentment and anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer indigenous Khmer majority, many whom eke out a simple living engaging in rural agrarian rice peasantry or fishing in a stark socioeconomic contrast to their modern, wealthier, and cosmopolitan middle class Chinese counterparts, who mainly engage in business, the skilled trades, or white collar professional occupations.\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "The Design Inference",
    "text": "The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities is a 1998 book by American philosopher and mathematician William A. Dembski, a proponent of intelligent design, which sets out to establish approaches by which evidence of intelligent agency could be inferred in natural and social situations. In the book he distinguishes between 3 general modes of competing explanations in order of priority: regularity, chance, and design. The processes in which regularity, chance, and design are ruled out one by one until one remains as a reasonable and sufficient explanation for an event, are what he calls an \"explanatory filter\". It is a method that tries to eliminate competing explanations in a systematic fashion including when a highly improbable event conforms to a discernible pattern that is given independently of the event itself. This pattern is Dembski's concept of specified complexity. Throughout the book he uses diverse examples such as detectability of spontaneous generation and occurrence of natural phenomena and cases of deceit like ballot rigging, plagiarism, falsification of data, etc.\n\nThe filter states that if the thing being examined cannot be explained by regularity, and if it is too statistically unlikely to be explained by chance, and contains an independently given pattern, then it may be attributed to design. Dembski says his concept is useful to those concerned with detecting design in different fields: forensic scientists, detectives, insurance fraud investigators, cryptographers, and SETI investigators, as well theologians and others who argue for the concepts of the fine-tuned universe and the Anthropic Principle.\n\n\"The Design Inference\" is specifically mentioned in the Wedge strategy as an example of accomplishing one of the intelligent design movement's five year goals of \"Thirty published books on design and its cultural implications (sex, gender issues, medicine, law, and religion). Described by the Discovery Institute as offering \"a powerful alternative [to Darwinism],\" the book is touted as being \"published by major secular university publishers.\"\n\nSome scientists from the SETI Institute and other fields, argue that they do not find application for Dembski's explanatory filter and the related concept of specified complexity, but rather base their work upon more prosaic methods and (in the case of SETI) a search for artificial simplicity.\n\nIn 2000, biologist Massimo Pigliucci criticized \"The Design Inference\" in \"BioScience\" writing, \"Too bad he missed the solution to this riddle, which has been proposed several times during the last few centuries, most prominently (and in various fashions) by Hume (1779), Darwin (1859), and Jacques Monod (1971). According to these thinkers, if a given phenomenon occurs with low probability and also conforms to a pre-specified pattern, then there are two possible conclusions: intelligent design (this concept is synonymous with human intervention) or necessity, which can be caused by a nonrandom, deterministic force such as natural selection.\" Pigliucci wrote \"Unfortunately, Cambridge University Press has offered a respectable platform for Dembski to mount his attack on 'materialist science'--which, of course, includes evolution. My hope is that scientists will not dismiss this book as just another craze originating in the intellectual backwaters of America. Neocreationism should be a call to arms for the science community. The battle is already raging, and scientists and educators are still not sure if they should even bother paying attention.\"\n\nMarine biologist Wesley R. Elsberry and critic of creationism reviewed the book in 1999. Elsberry described the book as \"...a slim and scholarly volume, as one expects from a distinguished academic press [with] clear writing, illustrative examples, and cogent argumentation. The work, though, is motivated and informed by an anti-evolutionary impulse, and its flaws appear to follow from the need to achieve an anti-evolutionary aim. The anti-evolutionary bent is not as overt here, though, as it is in other works by Dembski\". Elsberry criticizes the book for using a definition of \"design\" as what is left over after chance and regularity have been eliminated, and for using an argument that excludes natural selection \"a priori\" in order to conclude the existence of a designer when in fact natural selection fits Dembski's argument just as easily. Elsberry concludes:\n\n"

    "title": "Voyetra-8",
    "text": "The Voyetra-8 (Voyetra-Eight) is an eight voice polyphonic analog synthesizer. Released in 1982 by Octave-Plateau Electronics (later renamed Voyetra and still later merged with Turtle Beach Systems to become Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc.), it was one of the first analog programmable synthesizers to be rack-mountable and remains one of the most flexible digitally controlled analog synthesizers.\n\nThe Voyetra-8 is a 19\" rack-mountable device, 3 rack units high at the face. Most units are bowed at the top and so cannot be placed below other rack mounted equipment more than a few inches deep. It is approximately 16 inches deep in the rack, and weighs around 78\u00a0lbs. Rear mounted plugs and a large heat sink make at least 4\" rear clearance advisable.\n\nThe front panel has numerous buttons and knobs, which are active in live performance. However, the instrument is more complicated than it looks; there are fourteen \"pages\" of controls. Extra \"pages\" are accessed by hitting certain shift key combinations, after which most of the front-panel controls change function. These pages are used when setting up the instrument and programming sounds.\n\nThe rear panel has a mono output and a stereo output. When connected in stereo, one four-voice sound appears at each output if the instrument is in Dual or Layer mode, or the eight voices are each panned in different places between the outputs if the instrument is in Whole-8 mode.\n\nThe memory, which stores all of the user presets and parameters, can be dumped via MIDI to any sequencer. The dump is not MIDI System Exclusive (SysEx); it is encoded into controller changes and other common MIDI data, which any sequencer can handle. This may seem somewhat unusual, but in the day of the Voyetra, MIDI was in its infancy, and SysEx was not yet a proven strategy for transmitting and storing system information.\n\nThe Voyetra-8 has 8 separate programmable analog voice cards. Each produces one voice of the maximum 8. It can store 100 \"Voices\", and can play either one 8-voice sound in Whole-8 mode, a different 4-voice sound on each half of the keyboard (or on different MIDI channels) in Split mode, or two 4-voice sounds per note (which could both be the same) in Layer mode.\n\nThe keyboard mode, key assignment mode, two selected sounds, and a number of parameter trims and tweaks (such as octave shift on either Voice, detune, and cutoff frequency offset) are stored as a \"Step\". The instrument can store 100 Steps. Generally, a performer will call up Steps, not Voices, during live performance; each Step will call up two of the Voices and tweak them for the song to be played.\n\nEach voice has two VCOs, one VCA, one 24\u00a0dB/octave lowpass VCF, two LFOs, two ADSRs, noise generator, sync VCO 1 to VCO 2. (More detailed specs follow.)\n\nThe specs belie the complexity of the sound architecture, because of the great deal of control the programmer (and the player) has over various aspects of sound production, including key assignment modes, modulation routing, and envelope parameters.\n\nAny polyphonic instrument must use an algorithm to assign available voices to played notes (unless the instrument has enough voices to cover all of the notes). If a player is holding down 8 notes and hits another, does it sound? If so, does it rob the oldest note played or one of the others? If notes are not being held down but still decaying, will they be robbed? If a note is played repeatedly, does the same voice sound again or does another voice trigger, layered on top of the first? Many of the answers to these questions can be set by the programmer using the key assignment modes and envelope parameters.\n\nIn Whole-8 mode, the Voyetra-8 has 8 voices. In Split mode, it has two sets of four. In Layer mode, it has four.\n\nKey assignment modes are stored with the Step, not the Voice. The following are the possible key assignment modes:\n\n\nExtra envelope parameters (besides the Attack time, Decay time, Sustain level, and Release time) also control the way the sound responds to the keyboard.\n\n\nThe instrument contains a sophisticated matrix for the handling and routing of control voltages. There are four modulation \"banks\" per Voice. Each modulation bank is independent of the others; within each a modulation source and one or more destinations is chosen, and a controller is selected if it is desired to alter the amount of modulation during live performance.\n\nFor instance, on modulation bank A, one might choose LFO1 one as the source, VCO1 and VCO2 pitch as the destination, and channel aftertouch (pressure) as the controller. This could add vibrato to the notes when aftertouch pressure was applied to the keyboard. In bank B, one might then choose DC as the source, VCO2 pitch as the destination, and velocity as the controller. This could be used to detune VCO2 slightly relative to VCO1 when a note is struck hard.\n\n\n\nNote: Joystick +X and Joystick -X each can be assigned its own MIDI Continuous Controller number. Also, a global parameter setting on the Voy will invert the sense of the Joystick for the left Voice in all Steps that use Split Mode so that the left Voice gets the -X as a positive value. When this is done, the -X controller can be used to positively control modulation on the left Voice, while the +X controller can be used to positively control modulation of the right voice.\n\nNote that any combination of multiple destinations can be selected per bank.\n\n\n\nThe Voyetra VPK-5 keyboard, if used, is connected to the head using an XLR mic cable. This XLR cable, while compatible with those used by the Voyetra-8's MIDI, do not carry MIDI data. The Voyetra is fully controllable from a MIDI controller or sequencer. The VPK-5 keyboard has a joystick to the left of the keys where the pitch and mod wheels would commonly be found on other synthesizers.\n\n\nIn New Order's promotional music video for their 1985 single \"The Perfect Kiss\", the Voyetra-8 appears in the first scenes of the clip used by band member Gillian Gilbert. New Order used to tour with a rack containing four Voyetra-8s, although two were spares as early units tended to break down regularly. Gary Pozner, keyboard player for Tom Tom Club, also used the Voyetra-8, as his main synthesizer.\n\n"

    "title": "Condover Hall",
    "text": "Condover Hall is an elegant Grade I listed three-storey Elizabethan sandstone building, described as the grandest manor house in Shropshire, standing in a conservation area on the outskirts of Condover village, Shropshire, England, four miles south of the county town of Shrewsbury.\n\nA Royal manor in Anglo Saxon times, until the 16th\u00a0century Condover Manor was in and out of Crown Tenure. In 1586 it was purchased by Thomas Owen, a Member of Parliament for and Recorder of Shrewsbury, from the family of the previous owner, Henry Vynar, a London merchant who had died in 1585. Owen had had a lease of the manor from 1578, and been in lawsuit with the family.\n\nFor over sixty years from 1946 the Hall was run as a residential school, initially for blind children when owned by the RNIB and latterly under private ownership as a school for autistic children, covering boy boarders and coeducational day pupils. The school and college both closed during 2009.\n\nOwen died in 1598 before the new Hall was completed and its designer remains a matter of debate. Building accounts record that a John Richmond of Acton Reynald was the original master mason, but by 1591 Walter Hancock had taken over the position. Lawrence Shipway, the builder of the second (not current) Shire Hall at Stafford, also appears to have had some major contribution to the building design. The most compelling evidence can be found in drawings in the Sir John Soane's Museum that seems to prove that the Hall was designed by the influential Elizabethan architect John Thorpe in the early 1590s.\n\nBuilt out of pink sandstone, quarried at nearby Berriewood, Condover Hall has typical Elizabethan two-storey ground-floor rooms lit by tall windows with regular mullions and double transoms. There are fine chimneys, gables and a good example of a strapwork frieze. The grounds are laid out in formal 17th-century style with boxed yew hedges and sandstone balustraded terraces decorated with Italianate terracotta vases. Near the Cound Brook is an amusing flagstaff held by a sandstone gnome.\n\nOwned by the Owen family until the late 1860s, the house then passed to the Cholmondeley family, and novelist Mary Cholmondeley (1859\u20131925) lived in the hall for a few months in 1896 before moving to London. Her uncle, Reginald Cholmondeley (1826\u20131896), owned the house when it was visited by the American writer Mark Twain (1835\u20131910) in 1873 and 1879. The house and estate was sold by the family in 1897 to Edward Brocklehurst Fielden, who later sold it in 1926.\n\nLocal legend holds that no heir to Condover Hall will prosper since the hall was cursed from the gallows by a butler falsely accused of murder: \"Before Heaven I am innocent, though my master's son swears me guilty. And as I perish an innocent man, may those who follow my murdered lord be cursed.\" The butler had been condemned by the lies of the son of Knyvett, lord of the manor, who stabbed his father to death. As he stumbled down the basement stairs, Knyvett reached out his bloodied hand leaving an imprint upon the wall which defied all attempts to wash it away \u2014 the marked stone had to be eventually chipped clean.\n\nIn 1930 a Great Western Railway Hall Class 4900 steam locomotive, No. 4915 with a 4-6-0 configuration, was named \"Condover Hall\", remaining in regular service until 1965. In the 1980s Hornby toys issued an electric toy replica of the engine. The train used in the \"Harry Potter\" films as the Hogwarts Express is an identical Hall class locomotive. On 21 August 1994, Rail Express Systems liveried Class 47/7, No. 47784 was named \"Condover Hall\" at the Crewe Basford Hall Yard open day.\n\nBetween August 1942 and June 1945 the hall was commandeered by the War Office and pressed into service as the officers' mess for nearby RAF Condover.\n\nIn 1946 the Hall was purchased from its then owner, William Abbey, by RNIB and operated as Condover Hall School for the Blind, a residential facility for children aged between 5 and 18. RNIB built a covered heated swimming pool for use by the pupils. The hall was sold in 2005 to the Priory Group, who opened a residential school for autistic children and a college for young people with Asperger syndrome. The facility opened in 2006, but in 2008 the closure of both sites was announced. Condover Horizon school closed in January 2009, and Farleigh College Condover closed on 23 July 2009.\n\nThe Hall has undergone a multimillion-pound refurbishment programme to turn it into a well-equipped residential activity centre. Activities provided range from archery, abseiling to a laser maze and dance studio. The Hall intends to encourage physical activities and deliver cross-curricular learning opportunities. There is a Harry Potter themed spell room for younger children. Sports teams and events are hosted using the all-weather sports pitches, indoor sports hall and swimming pool, and the centre provides specific Netball coaching and match weekends. The centre can provide accommodation for 500 residents. With an occupancy of up to 500 people, the accommodation is in newly refurbished buildings throughout the estate grounds.\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Moro people",
    "text": "The collective term Moro people or Bangsamoro people refers to the 13 Islamized ethnolinguistic groups of Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan. As Muslim-majority ethnic groups, they form the largest non-Christian majority population in the Philippines, and comprise about 5% of the country's total population, or 5 million people. Most Moros are followers of Sunni Islam of the Shafi'i madh'hab. The Muslim Moros originally had an independent state known as the Sulu Sultanate, which once exercised sovereignty over the present day provinces of Basilan, Palawan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, the eastern part of the Malaysian state of Sabah (formerly North Borneo) and North Kalimantan in Indonesia.\n\nToday, the Moro people mostly live in southwest Mindanao, Sulu and Basilan, while small communities can also be found in most large modern cities of the Philippines, including Manila, Cebu and Davao. Some emigrated to Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei in the late 20th century due to the Moro conflict in Mindanao. Newer communities can be found today in Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Semporna in neighbouring Sabah, Malaysia, North Kalimantan in Indonesia, and in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.\n\nThe word \"Moro\" (a cognate of the English \"Moors\") originates as an exonym which, prior to the Spaniards' arrival in the Philippine archipelago, came to be used by the Spanish in reference to Muslims in general. The term originates from \"Mauru\", a Latin word that referred to the inhabitants of the ancient Roman province of Mauritania in northwest Africa, which today comprises the modern Muslim states of Algeria, Mauritania and Morocco. With the rise of Mauritania as part of the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate, Muslim armies conquered and ruled much of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 to 1492, for about a total of 781 years in which Spanish became involved in conflicts to reclaim Iberia. The term came to be extended to Muslims in general. The term was similarly applied by the Spanish to the Muslim communities they found in parts of the Philippine archipelago when they arrived. \n\nIn their struggle for self-determination, the term was later adopted in the names for separatist organizations such as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), Rashid Lucman's Bangsa Moro Liberation Organisation (BMLO) as well the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).\n\nThe recently coined term \"Bangsamoro\" is derived from the Malay word \"\"bangsa\"\", (originally meaning \"nation\" but altered to denote \"race\" in colonial times) with the \"\"Moro\"\" as \"people\" and may also be used to describe both the Muslim-majority ethnolinguistic groups and their homeland. The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro recognizes \"Bangsamoro\" as an identity and called for the creation of a new autonomous political entity called Bangsamoro.\n\nThough the term may carry some derogatory connations by some, the term Moro has evolved to become seen as a unitary force especially by the Philippine government, despite opposition from some of the modern Muslim communities in the Philippines who object to the term's origin with the Spanish colonial era. Marvic Leonen, who was the Chief Peace Negotiator for Philippine government with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, has said:\n\nThe thirteen Muslim-majority Philippine ethnic groups:\n\nThe majority of the Moro people historically reside in the area now called the \"Bangsamoro\" region which was commonly called Muslim Mindanao in 1989 when the ARMM was created. That land is located in the provinces of Basilan, Cotabato, Compostela Valley, Davao del Sur, Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Palawan, Sarangani, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Sulu, Tawi-Tawi. It includes the cities of Cotabato, Dapitan, Dipolog, General Santos, Iligan, Marawi. The eastern part of a territory of the former British protectorate in North Borneo (now in the eastern Sabah), which have since became part of the federation of Malaysia, is also claimed by the Moro National Liberation Front for the proposed state of Bangsamoro Republik. However, the idea has failed since the MNLF founding leader Misuari self-exiled himself after clashing with the government in 2013 in Zamboanga City, as he protested the further unilateral changes by the government on the mutually signed 1996 Final Peace Agreement. Misuari was labelled as a \"terrorist\" during the siege.\n\nOn 5 August 2008, after nearly 10 years of negotiation, with all Thebes's associated international bodies all ready to witness a supposed historic event, an attempt by the Philippine government's Peace Negotiating Panel to sign a Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front through a petition by Settler politicians in Mindanao like Governor Manny Pinol and Governor Lobregat, was then declared unconstitutional by the Philippine Supreme Court. Conflict immediately broke out on the ground following the decision, with nearly half a million people displaced and hundreds killed. Observers now concur that two Moro commanders \u2014 Kumander Umbra Kato and Kumander Bravo \u2014 did launch attacks in Lanao del Norte and North Cotabato as a response to the non-signing that has shaken the peace process in the region.\n\nThe Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro defines the Bangsamoro to be who at the time of conquest and colonization were considered natives or original inhabitants of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago and its adjacent islands including Palawan, and their descendants whether of mixed or of full blood\".\n\nIslam is the most dominant influence on the Moro cultures since the era of the Sultanate of Maguindanao and Sulu. Large and small mosques can be found all over the region. In accordance with Islamic Law, alcohol and fornication are prohibited. Pork and pork byproducts are not permissible. Another practice is fasting during Ramadan and providing charity for the poor. The Hajj is also a major requirement as it is one of the five pillars of Islam. Moro women cover themselves using a veil (\"tudong\") just as in Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and southern Thailand. Moro men, especially the elderly, can always be seen wearing a black Muslim skull cap called the \"songkok\" or the white one called the \"taqiyah\". Differentiating from their Malay relatives in neighboring countries, the only main problems associated with Moro groups is that they are not always united and lack a sense of solidarity.\n\nThe culture of the Moros of Mindanao revolves around the music of the kulintang, a type of gong instrument, akin to the drum instrument, yet wholly made of bronze or brass found in the southern Philippines. This creates a unique sound that varies in the speed it is hit which includes the Binalig, Tagonggo and the Kapanirong plus others more also normally heard in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.\n\nThere are at least thirteen ethnic groups referred to as \"Moros\"; all descended from the same Austronesian people (Malayo-Polynesian) theorized to have migrated from Taiwan and populated the regions of the Philippines, Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands and Madagascar. Three of these groups make up the majority of those classified as Moros. They are the Maguindanaon of North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Maguindanao provinces, the Maranao of the Lanao provinces and the Taus\u016bg of the Sulu Archipelago. Smaller groups include the Banguingui, Samal and the Bajau of the Sulu Archipelago; the Yakan of Basilan and Zamboanga del Sur, the Illanun of Lanao provinces and Davao and Sangir of Davao, the Molbog of southern Palawan and the Jama Mapuns of Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi Island. These indigenous people from the south mostly converted to the religion of Islam making them Muslims or Moros. Some of them converted over to Christianity and other religions.\n\nIn the Philippines, people are mostly native speakers of a variety of Austronesian languages. The most-spoken native languages of the Moros are Maguindanaon, Taus\u016bg and Maranao. The Maguindanao language is spoken in the Maguindanao Province, the Maranao language is predominant in the Lanao region, and is the majority spoken in Lanao del Sur, and the Tausug language is spoken in the Sulu Archipelago with speakers in the Zamboanga Peninsula and the Malaysian state of Sabah. Other Austronesian languages spoken by their respective ethnolinguistic groups are the Sama-Bajau languages (although the Banguingui, the Samal and the Badjao share the same language, there ends the similarity; they are different in all other aspects especially when it comes to religion), as well as Yakan and Kalagan. Also spoken among the Moros of Mindanao and Sulu is Tagalog (Filipino), it being the national language and lingua franca of the Philippines. There also exists a native Tagalog Muslim community in the Quiapo District of Metro Manila. Because of the mass influx of Cebuano migrants to Mindanao, many tend to be exposed to the Cebuano language from Visayans easily enough to be able to speak it.\n\nA sizeable minority speaks Malay, also an Austronesian language which was once the \"lingua franca\" of maritime Southeast Asia prior to contact with the European colonial powers. Today, many Moro merchants use Malay to converse with citizens of the neighboring Malay-speaking nations of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Most of the Malay-speaking Muslims of the Philippines are those in the southern parts of the Zamboanga Peninsula, the Sulu Archipelago and the southern predominantly Muslim-inhabited municipalities of Bataraza and Balabac in Palawan. They likely speak a form of Malay creole. Many of the Taus\u016bg in Malaysia and Indonesia (known there as \"Suluks\") tend to lose their proficiency in both Taus\u016bg and Chavacano, as well on Tagalog, as they became assimilated into the Malay-speaking majority of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.\n\nChavacano (sometimes spelled as Chabacano or Chabakano) refers to a number of Philippine Spanish-based creole varieties found in the Philippines. The Zamboangue\u00f1o variety, originating in Zamboanga city, is the variety with the most speakers. A number of Moros have also attained the ability to speak this language depending on exposure, especially those that live in Zamboanga and Basilan. Chavacano also contains communities of speakers in Semporna, Sabah.\n\nArabic, being the liturgical language of Islam, is spoken by a small number of Moros. Most Filipino Muslim people, however, do not know Arabic beyond its religious uses. All native languages are written in the Latin script. However, an Arabic script known as Jawi has traditionally been used to write Taus\u016bg language.\n\nGenerally, Moros are educated. While the majority of Moros attend both government and private educational institutions especially in key cities such as Davao, Cebu and Manila, some may choose formal Islamic education and are enrolled in Islamic/Arabic institutions like the Jamiatul Mindanao Al-Islamie in Marawi City. At the tertiary level, there are government and privately run educational institutions in the traditionally Moro-inhabited areas. In Marawi, many attend Mindanao State University, the second-biggest state university in the Philippines next to University of the Philippines, which has several campuses across Mindanao. Mindanao State University also has an Islamic Institute within its campus (the King Faisal Centre for Islamic Arabic, Asian Studies). With the assistance of scholarship grants, some even attend university outside the country.\n\nIn the 13th century, the arrival of Muslim missionaries from the Persian Gulf, in particular Makhdum Karim, in Tawi-Tawi initiated the conversion of the native population to Islam. Trade between other sultanates in Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia helped establish and entrench the Islamic religion in the southern Philippines. In 1457, the introduction of Islam led to the creation of Sultanates. This included the sultanates of Buayan, Maguindanao and the Sultanate of Sulu, which is considered the oldest Muslim government in the region until its annexation by the United States in 1898.\n\nLike Brunei, Sulu and other Muslim sultanates in the Philippines were introduced to Islam through Chinese Muslims, Persians, and Arab traders. Chinese Muslim merchants participated in the local commerce, and the Sultanate had diplomatic relations with Ming Dynasty China. As it was involved in the tribute system, the Sulu leader Paduka Batara and his sons moved to China, where he died and Chinese Muslims subsequently brought up his sons. The inhabitants of pre-Hispanic Philippines practised Islam and Animism. The Malay kingdoms interacted, and traded with various tribes throughout the islands, governing several territories ruled by leaders called Rajah, Datu and Sultan. Before the arrival of Islam the Rajahs and Datus governed the territories.\n\nIn 1519, the Spanish expedition to the East Indies began in search for a westward route to the Maluku Islands (the \"Spice Islands\"), led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. The fleet reached the Philippine archipelago in March 1521 where Magellan was to die during the Battle of Mactan and before the expedition's successful circumnavigation and return. Several subsequent expeditions to the islands were sent until the 1564 Miguel Lopez de Legazpi was successful, marking the start of Spanish colonization of what is now the Philippines in 1565.\n\nThe sultanates, however, actively resisted the Spaniards. With intentions of pacifying the islands, the Spaniards made incursions into Moro territory. They also began erecting military stations and garrisons with Catholic missions, which attracted Christianised natives of civilian settlements. The most notable of these are Zamboanga and Cotabato. Spain was in the midst of the Inquisition which required Jews and Muslims to convert to Roman Catholicism or leave or face the death penalty; thus Spaniards tried to ban and suppress Islam in areas they conquered. Feeling threatened by these actions, the Moros decided to challenge the Spanish government. They began conducting raids on Catholic coastal towns. These Moro raids reached a fevered pitched during the reign of Datu Bantilan in 1754.\n\nThe Spanish\u2013Moro Conflict started at the phase of Castille War (Spanish-Bruneian War) of 1578, which created the war between Spaniards and Moros in areas held by Sultanate of Brunei, lasted several hundred years, while the Castille War itself lasted only two months. The string of coastal fortifications, military garrisons and forts built by the Spaniards ensured that these raids, although destructive to the Philippine economies of the coastal settlements, were eventually stifled. The advent of steam-powered naval ships in the 1800s finally drove the antiquated Moro navy of colorful proas and vintas to their bases. It took at least two decades of the presence of the Spanish in the Philippines for them to launch an extensive conquest of Mindanao. The Sultanate of Sulu, one of the last Sultanates existing, itself soon fell under a concerted naval and ground attack from Spanish forces. In the last quarter of the 19th century Moros in the Sultanate of Sulu allowed the Spanish to build forts, but these areas remained loosely controlled by the Spanish as their sovereignty was limited to military stations and garrisons and pockets of civilian resettlements in Zamboanga and Cotabato (the latter under the Sultanate of Maguindanao), until the Spanish had to abandon the region as a consequence of their defeat in the Spanish\u2013American War. Before that, in order to retain independence, the Sultanate of Sulu had given up its rule over Palawan to Spain in 1705 and Basilan to Spain in 1762; the areas that the Sulu Sultanate gave partial rule to Spain are Sulu and Tawi-Tawi.\n\nIn 1876, the Spaniards launched a campaign to placate Jolo and made a final bid to establish a government in the southern islands. On 21 February of that year, the Spaniards assembled the largest contingent in Jolo, consisting of 9,000 soldiers in 11 transports, 11 gunboats and 11 steamboats. Jos\u00e9 Malcampo occupied Jolo and established a Spanish settlement with Pascual Cervera appointed to set up a garrison and serve as military governor. He served from March 1876 to December 1876 and was followed by Jos\u00e9 Paulin (December 1876 \u2013 April 1877), Carlos Mart\u00ednez (September 1877 \u2013 February 1880), Rafael de Rivera (1880\u20131881), Isidro G. Soto (1881\u20131882), Eduardo Bremon, (1882), Julian Parrrado (1882\u20131884), Francisco Castilla (1884\u20131886), Juan Arolas (1886\u20131893), Ca\u00e9sar Mattos (1893), Venancio Hern\u00e1ndez (1893\u20131896) and Luis Huerta (1896\u20131899).\nThe Chinese sold small arms like Enfield and Spencer Rifles to the Buayan Sultanate of Datu Uto. They were used to battle the Spanish invasion of the Sultanate of Buayan. The Datu paid for the weapons in slaves.\n\nThe population of Chinese in Mindanao in the 1880s was 1,000. The Chinese ran guns across a Spanish blockade to sell to Mindanao Moros. The purchases of these weapons were paid for by the Moros in slaves in addition to other goods. The main group of people selling guns were the Chinese in Sulu. The Chinese took control of the economy and used steamers to ship goods for exporting and importing. Opium, ivory, textiles, and crockery were among the other goods which the Chinese sold. The Chinese on Maimbung sent the weapons to the Sulu Sultanate, who used them to battle the Spanish and resist their attacks. A Chinese-Mestizo was one of the Sultan's brothers-in-law, the Sultan was married to his sister. He and the Sultan both owned shares in the ship (named the Far East) which helped smuggle weapons.\n\nThe Spanish launched a surprise offensive under Colonel Juan Arolas in April 1887 by attacking the sultanate's capital at Maimbung in an effort to crush resistance. Weapons were captured and the property of the Chinese were destroyed while the Chinese were deported to Jolo. By 1878, the Spanish had fortified Jolo with a perimeter wall and tower gates, built inner forts called Puerta Blockaus, Puerta Espa\u00f1a and Puerta Alfonso XII, and two outer fortifications named \"Princesa de Asturias\" and \"Torre de la Reina\". Troops, including a cavalry with its own lieutenant commander, were garrisoned within the protective confine of the walls. In 1880, Rafael Gonzales de Rivera, who was appointed the governor, dispatched the 6th Regiment to govern Siasi and Bongao islands.\n\nAfter the Spanish\u2013American War, Spain ceded to the United States administration of the Philippine archipelago, which included Sulu and Mindanao, by the 1898 Treaty of Paris. At the beginning of their administration, American officials began about placating any remaining violence in the Moro areas. The problem of \"Juramentados\" persisted in the early 20th century but was eventually successfully stopped by the Americans.\n\nThe Moros fought against the Japanese occupation of Mindanao and Sulu during World War II and eventually drove them out. Also when the Japanese occupied the northern Borneo area, they also helped their relatives there in a struggle to fight off the Japanese where many of them, including women and children, were massacred after their revolt with the Chinese had been foiled by the Japanese.\n\nAfter gaining independence from the United States, the Moro population, which was isolated from the mainstream and experienced discrimination by the Philippine government, added to the fact that they were now governed by what they view as the former foot soldiers of Spain, their ancestral lands given away to settlers and corporations by land-tenure Laws, arming the settlers as militia in Mindanao, Filipinisation was a government policy which eventually gave rise to armed secession movements. Thus, the struggle for independence has been in existence for several centuries, starting from the Spanish period, the Moro rebellion during the United States occupation and up to the present day. Modern-day Moro conflict began in the 1960s. During the period, the Philippine government envisioned a new country in which Christian and Moro would be assimilated into the dominant culture. This vision, however, was generally rejected by both groups, the Christians remembering stories from Spanish foot soldiers of how fierce the Moro was, and the Moro remembering the Christian as aiding its hated Spanish enemy for 300 years. These two prejudices continue to this day. Because of this, the National government realized that there was a need for a specialized agency to deal with the Moro community, so it set up the Commission for National Integration (CNI) in the 1960s, which was later replaced by the Office of Muslim Affairs, and Cultural Communities (OMACC) and later on as OMA.\n\nAs they thought, concessions were made to the Moro after the creation of these agencies, with the Moro population receiving exemptions from national laws prohibiting polygamy and divorce which the Moro has already been exercising. In 1977, the Philippine government made another palliative attempt to move a step further by harmonizing Moro customary law with the national law which has no bearing at all for the Moro. Naturally, most of these achievements were seen as superficial. The Moro, still dissatisfied with the past Philippine governments' policies and misunderstanding established a first separatist group known as the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari with the intention of creating an independent country. This initiated the modern Moro conflict in the Philippines, which still persists, and has since deepened the fractures between Muslims, Christians, and people of other religions. The MNLF is the only recognized representative organization for the Muslims of the Philippines by the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC). By the 1970s, a paramilitary organization created by settler mayors in collusion with the Philippine Constabulary, mainly of armed Hiligaynon-speaking Christian residents of mainland Mindanao, called the \"Ilagas\" began operating in Cotabato originating from settler communities. In response, Moro volunteers with minimal weapons also group themselves with much old traditional weapons like the kris, spears and barong, such as the \"Blackshirts\" of Cotabato and the \"Barracudas\" of Lanao, began to appear and engage the \"Ilagas\". The Armed Forces of the Philippines were also deployed; however, their presence only seemed to create more violence and reports that the Army and the settler militia are helping each other. A Zamboangan version of the Ilagas, the \"Mundo Oscuro\" (Spanish for \"Dark World\"), was also organized in Zamboanga and Basilan.\n\nIn 1981, internal divisions within the MNLF caused the establishment of an Islamic paramilitary breakaway organization called the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The group continued the conflict when the MNLF signed a Peace Deal with the Philippine Government in 1994. It has now become the biggest and most organized Moro armed group in Mindanao and Sulu. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front is now on the final stages of the required annexe for the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro that has a set time-frame for full implementation in 2016.\n\nAlthough initialed in a 1976 ceasefire, come 1987 as a fall out of the EDSA revolution, peace talks with the MNLF picked up pace with the intention of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in Mindanao. On 1 August 1989, through Republic Act No. 6734, known as the Organic Act, a 1989 plebiscite was held in 18 provinces in Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago and Palawan without considering the effects of continuous migration by settlers from Luz\u00f3n and the Visayas. This was said to determine if the residents would still want to be part of an Autonomous Region. Out of all the Provinces and cities participating in the plebiscite, only four provinces opted to join, namely: Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. Even its regional capital, Cotabato City, rejected joining the autonomous region as the settlers has now greatly outnumbered the Moro and Lumad. When before they were a majority, they have now become a minority. This still led to the creation of the ARMM, however. A second plebiscite, held a year more in 2001, managed to include Basilan (except its capital, Isabela City) and Marawi City in the autonomous region. Of the original 13 provinces agreed on the Final Peace Agreement (FPA) with the MNLF, only 5 has now been included in the present-day ARMM due to the continuous settler program of the Republic of the Philippines that started in the earnest of 1901.\n\nThe ARMM is headed by a regional governor as the outcome of the Final Peace Agreement between the MNLF and the Philippine government in 1996 under President Fidel Ramos. The regional governor, with the regional-vice governor, act as the executive branch and are served by a Regional Cabinet, composed of regional secretaries, mirroring national government agencies of the Philippines. The ARMM has a unicameral Regional Assembly headed by a speaker. This acts as the legislative branch for the region and is responsible for regional ordinances. It is composed of three members for every congressional district. The current membership is twenty-four. Some of the Regional Assembly's acts have since been nullified by the Supreme Court on grounds that they are \"unconstitutional\". An example is the nullification of the creation of the Province of Shariff Kabungsuwan by the Regional Legislative Assembly (RLA) as this will create an extra seat in the Philippines Congress' House of Representatives, a power reserved solely for the Philippine Congress \u2014 Senate and House jointly \u2014 to decide on. Some would say, that this proves in itself the fallacy of its Autonomy granted by the Central Government during the Peace Process.\n\nThe Moros had a history of resistance against Spanish, American, and Japanese rule for over 400 years. The armed struggle against the Spanish, Americans, Japanese and Filipinos is considered by present Moro leaders as part of the four centuries long \"sovereign based conflict\" of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation). The 400-year-long resistance against the Japanese, Americans, and Spanish by the Moro persisted and morphed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state. Some Moros have formed their own separatist organisations such as the MNLF, MILF and become a members of more extreme groups such as the Abu Sayyaf (ASG) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and the latest formed is Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighter ( BIFF). Now, even the armed Communist Party has gained its foothold in Mindanao with large Lumad adherents.\n\nThe Moro Islamic Liberation Front boycotted the original referendum formed by the Organic Act referendum and continued their armed struggle until present. However, it remains a partner to the peace process, with the Philippines unwilling to brand MILF as a \"terrorist\" group. Today, the Moro people had become marginalises and a minority in Mindanao, they are also disadvantaged than majority Christians in terms of employment and housing; they are also discriminated. Due to this, it has established escalating tensions that have contributed to the ongoing conflict between the Philippine government and the Moro people. In addition, there has been a large exodus of Moro peoples comprising the Taus\u016bg, Samal, Bajau, Illanun and Maguindanao to Malaysia (Sabah) and Indonesia (North Kalimantan) since the 1970s, due to the illegal annexation of their land by the Catholic majority, and armed Settler militias such as the Ilaga which has destroyed the trust between Mindanao Settlers and Moro communities. Further, Land Tenure Laws have changed the population statistics of the Bangsamoro to a significant degree and has caused the gradual displacement of the Moros from their traditional lands.\n\nThe office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process has posted a set of frequently asked questions about the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), the draft of which President Benigno Aquino III submitted to Congress leaders. The Bangsamoro Basic Law abolishes the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and establishes the new Bangsamoro political identity in its place. The law is based on the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in March 2014. It is still to be implemented by the Government by Congressional mandate.\n\nDue to their conflict in the southern Philippines, many Moros have emigrated to the Malaysian state of Sabah since the 1970s in search of better lives because of the close proximity between Sulu islands and the state of Sabah. Most of them are illegal immigrants and live in squalor, thus the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a proper settlement to ease management.\n\nIn 2018, a unification gathering of all the sultans of the Sulu archipelago and representatives from all ethnic communities in the Sulu archipelago commenced in Zamboanga City, declaring themselves as the \"Bangsa Sug\" peoples and separating them from the \"Bangsa Moro\" peoples of mainland central Mindanao. They cited the complete difference in cultures and customary ways of life they have with the central Mindanao Muslims as the primary reason for their separation. They also called the government to establish a separate Philippine state, called \"Bangsa Sug\", from mainland Bangsa Moro or to incorporate the Sulu archipelago to whatever state is formed in the Zamboanga peninsula, if ever federalism in the Philippines is approved in the coming years.\n\n\n\nMoro nationalists/separatists:\n\nMoro websites:\n"

    "title": "Greek junta",
    "text": "The Greek junta or Regime of the Colonels was a series of far-right military juntas that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974. On 21 April 1967, a group of colonels overthrew the caretaker government a month before scheduled elections which Georgios Papandreou's Center Union was favored to win. The dictatorship was characterised by right-wing cultural policies, restrictions on civil liberties, and the imprisonment, torture, and exile of political opponents. An attempt to renew its support in a 1973 referendum on the monarchy and gradual democratisation was ended by another coup by hardliner Dimitrios Ioannidis. The junta's rule ended on 24 July 1974 under the pressure of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, leading to the Metapolitefsi (\"regime change\") to democracy and the establishment of the Third Hellenic Republic.\n\nThe 1967 coup and the following seven years of military rule were the culmination of 30 years of national division between the forces of the left and the right, that can be traced to the time of the resistance against Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. After the liberation in 1944, Greece descended into a civil war, fought between the communist forces and the now-returned government-in-exile.\n\nIn 1944 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill determined to halt the Soviet encroachment in the Balkans, and ordered British forces to intervene in the Greek Civil War (see Dekemvriana) in the wake of the retreating German military. This was to be a lengthy and open ended commitment. The United States stepped in to help after 1947 the Greek government against the communist forces. \n\nIn 1947, the United States formulated the Truman Doctrine, and began actively supporting a series of authoritarian governments in Greece, Turkey, and Iran in order to ensure that these states did not fall under Soviet influence. In 1945, officer veterans of the collaborationist Security Battalions had organized themselves into a secret society known as the IDEA (\"Ieros Desmos Ellinon Axiomatikon\"-Holy Bond of Greek Officers). From 1947 onward, the Holy Bond was subsidized to the sum of $1 million annually by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as one of Greece's main \"democratic\" (i.e. anti-communist) forces. Several of the future leaders of the junta such as Georgios Papadopoulos were members of IDEA. With American and British aid, the civil war ended with the military defeat of the communists in 1949. The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) and its ancillary organizations were outlawed (), and many Communists either fled the country or faced persecution. The CIA and the Greek military began to work together closely, especially after Greece joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. This included notable CIA officers Gust Avrakotos and Clair George. Avrakotos maintained a close relationship with the colonels who would figure in the later coup. \n\nIn 1952, IDEA issued a manifesto stating that a dictatorship was the only possible solution to Greece's problems, which the Greek scholar Christos Kassimeris called an \"astonishing\" statement since the Communists had been defeated in 1949, Greece was enjoying relative prosperity after living standards had collapsed in the 1940s, and Greek politics were stable. Kassimeris argued that since Papadopoulos played a large role in writing the 1952 manifesto, that it was his \"personal ambition\" rather than an objective fear of the Greek Communists that was driving him forward because in no way could Greece be presented as being on the brink of a Communist take-over in 1952. \n\nGreece was a vital link in the NATO defense arc which extended from the eastern border of Iran to the northernmost point in Norway. Greece in particular was seen as being at risk, having experienced a communist insurgency. In particular, the newly founded Hellenic National Intelligence Service (EYP) and the Mountain Raiding Companies (LOK) maintained a very close liaison with their American counterparts. In addition to preparing for a Soviet invasion, they agreed to guard against a left-wing \"coup\". The LOK in particular were integrated into the European stay-behind network. Although there have been persistent rumors about an active support of the coup by the U.S. government, there is no evidence to support such claims. The timing of the coup apparently caught the CIA by surprise. Nevertheless, the United States did support the military dictatorship.\n\nAfter many years of conservative rule, the election of the Centre Union's Georgios Papandreou as Prime Minister was a sign of change. In a bid to gain more control over the country's government than his limited constitutional powers allowed, the young and inexperienced King Constantine II clashed with liberal reformers. In July 1964, Papandreou announced his intention to fire those officers belonging to IDEA, whom the king did not want dismissed, claiming it was his royal prerogative to protect the IDEA officers, which in turn led to massive demonstrations in Athens, which had a republican favor. The king dismissed Papandreou in 1965 and causing a constitutional crisis known as the \"Apostasia of 1965\".\n\nAfter making several attempts to form governments, relying on dissident Centre Union and conservative MPs, Constantine II appointed an interim government under Ioannis Paraskevopoulos, and new elections were called for 28 May 1967. There were many indications that Papandreou's Centre Union would emerge as the largest party, but would not be able to form a single-party government and would be forced into an alliance with the United Democratic Left, which was suspected by conservatives of being a proxy for the banned KKE. This possibility was used as a pretext for the \"coup\".\n\nGreek historiography and journalists have hypothesized about a \"Generals' \"Coup\"\", a coup that would have been deployed at Constantine's behest under the pretext of combating communist subversion.\n\nBefore the elections that were scheduled for 28 May 1967, with expectations of a wide Center Union victory, a number of conservative National Radical Union politicians feared that the policies of left-wing Centrists, including Andreas Papandreou (the son of Georgios Papandreou), would lead to a constitutional crisis. One such politician, George Rallis, proposed that, in case of such an \"anomaly\", the King should declare martial law as the monarchist constitution permitted him. According to Rallis, Constantine was receptive to the idea.\n\nAccording to U.S. diplomat John Day, Washington also worried that Andreas Papandreou would have a very powerful role in the next government, because of his father's old age. According to Robert Keely and John Owens, American diplomats present in Athens at the time, Constantine asked U.S. Ambassador William Phillips Talbot what the American attitude would be to an extra-parliamentary solution to the problem. To this the embassy responded negatively in principle \u2013 adding, however, that, \"U.S. reaction to such a move cannot be determined in advance but would depend on circumstances at the time.\" Constantine denies this. According to Talbot, Constantine met the army generals, who promised him that they would not take any action before the coming elections. However, the proclamations of Andreas Papandreou made them nervous, and they resolved to re-examine their decision after seeing the results of the elections.\n\nIn 1966, Constantine sent his envoy, Demetrios Bitsios, to Paris on a mission to persuade former prime minister Constantine Karamanlis to return to Greece and resume his prior role in politics. According to uncorroborated claims made by the former monarch, Karamanlis replied to Bitsios that he would return only if the King imposed martial law, as was his constitutional prerogative. According to \"New York Times\" correspondent Cyrus L. Sulzberger, Karamanlis flew to New York City to meet with USAF General Lauris Norstad to lobby for a conservative coup that would establish himself as Greece's leader; Sulzberger alleges that Norstad declined to involve himself in such affairs. Sulzberger's account rests solely on the authority of his and Norstad's word. When, in 1997, the former King reiterated Sulzberger's allegations, Karamanlis stated that he \"will not deal with the former king's statements because both their content and attitude are unworthy of comment\".\n\nThe deposed King's adoption of Sulzberger's claims against Karamanlis was castigated by Greece's left-leaning media, which denounced Karamanlis as \"shameless\" and \"brazen\". At the time Constantine referred exclusively to Sulzberger's account to support the theory of a planned \"coup\" by Karamanlis, and made no mention of the alleged 1966 meeting with Bitsios, which he referred to only after both participants had died and could not respond.\n\nAs it turned out, the constitutional crisis did not originate either from the political parties, or from the Palace, but from middle-rank army putschists.\n\nOn 21 April 1967, just weeks before the scheduled elections, a group of right-wing army officers led by Brigadier General Stylianos Pattakos and Colonels George Papadopoulos and Nikolaos Makarezos seized power in a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\". The colonels were able to seize power quickly by using elements of surprise and confusion. Pattakos was the commander of the Armour Training Centre (, \u039a\u0395\u03a4\u0398), based in Athens.\n\nThe coup leaders placed tanks in strategic positions in Athens, effectively gaining complete control of the city. At the same time, a large number of small mobile units were dispatched to arrest leading politicians, authority figures, and ordinary citizens suspected of left-wing sympathies, according to lists prepared in advance. One of the first to be arrested was Lieutenant General Grigorios Spandidakis, Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Army. The colonels persuaded Spandidakis to join them, having him activate a previously-drafted action plan to move the coup forward. Under the command of paratrooper Brigadier General Kostas Aslanides, the LOK took over the Greek Defence Ministry while Pattakos gained control of communication centers, the parliament, the royal palace, and \u2013 according to detailed lists \u2013 arrested over 10,000 people.\n\nBy the early morning hours, the whole of Greece was in the hands of the colonels. All leading politicians, including acting Prime Minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, had been arrested and were held incommunicado by the conspirators. At 6:00\u00a0a.m. EET, Papadopoulos announced that eleven articles of the Greek constitution were suspended. One of the consequences of these suspensions was that anyone could be arrested without warrant at any time and brought before a military court to be tried. Ioannis Ladas, then the director of ESA, recounted in a later interview that, \"Within twenty minutes every politician, every man, every anarchist who was listed could be rounded up ... It was a simple, diabolical plan\". Georgios Papandreou was arrested after a nighttime raid at his villa in Kastri, Attica. Andreas was arrested at around the same time, after seven soldiers armed with fixed bayonets and a machine gun forcibly entered his home. Andreas Papandreou escaped to the roof of his house, but surrendered after one of the soldiers held a gun to the head of his then-fourteen-year-old son George Papandreou. \n\nU.S. critics of the coup included then-Senator Lee Metcalf, who criticised the Johnson Administration for providing aid to a \"military regime of collaborators and Nazi sympathisers\". Phillips Talbot, the U.S. ambassador in Athens, disapproved of the coup, complaining that it represented \"a rape of democracy\", to which John M. Maury, the CIA station chief in Athens, answered, \"How can you rape a whore?\" Papadopoulos' junta attempted to re-engineer the Greek political landscape by coup. Papadopoulos as well as the other junta members are known in Greece by the term \"Aprilianoi\" (Aprilians), denoting the month of the coup. The term \"Aprilianoi\" has become synonymous with the term \"dictators of 1974\".\n\nAccording to journalist Eric Frattini the coup d'\u00e9tat was partly funded by Vatican agents who handed over $ 4 million to Georgios Papadopoulos through an intricate network of banks, as they feared the election of Andreas Papandreou, a leftist politician accused of having sympathies for communism.\n\nWhen the tanks came to the streets of Athens on 21 April, the legitimate National Radical Union government, of which Rallis was a member, asked King Constantine to immediately mobilise the state against the coup; he declined to do so, and swore in the dictators as the legitimate government of Greece.\n\nThe King, who had relented and decided to co-operate, claims to this day that he was isolated and did not know what else to do. He has since claimed that he was trying to gain time to organise a counter-coup and oust the Junta. He did organise such a counter-coup; however, the fact that the new government had a legal sanction, in that it had been appointed by the legitimate head of state, played an important role in the coup's success. The King was later to regret his decision bitterly. For many Greeks, it served to identify him indelibly with the coup and certainly played an important role in the final decision to abolish the monarchy, sanctioned by the 1974 referendum.\n\nThe only concession the King could achieve was to appoint a civilian as prime minister, rather than Spandidakis. Konstantinos Kollias, a former Attorney General of the Areios Pagos (supreme court), was chosen. He was a well-known royalist and had even been disciplined under the Papandreou government for meddling in the investigation of the murder of MP Gregoris Lambrakis. Kollias was little more than a figurehead and real power rested with the army, and especially Papadopoulos, who emerged as the coup's strong man and became Minister to the Presidency of the Government. Other coup members occupied key posts.\n\nUp until then constitutional legitimacy had been preserved, since under the Greek Constitution the King could appoint whomever he wanted as prime minister, as long as Parliament endorsed the appointment with a vote of confidence or a general election was called. It was this government, sworn-in during the early evening hours of 21 April, that formalised the coup. It adopted a \"Constituent Act\", an amendment tantamount to a revolution, cancelling the elections and effectively abolishing the constitution, which would be replaced later.\n\nIn the meantime, the government was to rule by decree. Since traditionally such Constituent Acts did not need to be signed by the Crown, the King never signed it, permitting him to claim, years later, that he had never signed any document instituting the junta. Critics claim that Constantine II did nothing to prevent the government (and especially his chosen prime minister, Kollias) from legally instituting the authoritarian government to come. This same government published and enforced a decree, already proclaimed on radio as the coup was in progress, instituting military law. Constantine claimed he never signed that decree either.\n\nFrom the outset, the relationship between Constantine and the colonels was an uneasy one. The colonels were not willing to share power, whereas the young king, like his father before him, was used to playing an active role in politics and would never consent to being a mere figurehead, especially in a military administration. Although the colonels' strong anti-communist, pro-NATO, and pro-Western views appealed to the United States, President Lyndon B. Johnson \u2013 in an attempt to avoid an international backlash \u2013 told Constantine that it would be best to replace the junta with a new government according to Paul Ioannidis in his book \"Destiny Prevails: My life with Arist\u00f3teles Onassis\". Constantine took that as an encouragement to organize a counter-coup, although no direct help or involvement of the U.S. (or Britain) was forthcoming.\n\nThe King finally decided to launch his counter-coup on 13 December 1967. Since Athens was militarily in the hands of the colonels, Constantine decided to fly to the small northern city of Kavala, where he hoped to be among troops loyal only to him. The vague plan that Constantine and his advisors had conceived was to form a unit that would invade and take control over Thessaloniki, where an alternative administration would be installed. Constantine hoped that international recognition and internal pressure between the two governments would force the junta to resign, leaving the field clear for him to return triumphant to Athens.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 December, the King boarded the royal plane, together with Queen Anne-Marie, their two baby children Princess Alexia and Crown Prince Pavlos, his mother Frederika, and his sister, Princess Irene. Constantine also took with him Prime Minister Kollias. At first, things seemed to be going according to plan. Constantine was well received in Kavala, which was under the command of a general loyal to him. The Hellenic Air Force and Navy, both strongly royalist and not involved in the junta, immediately declared for him and mobilised. Another of Constantine's generals effectively cut all communication between Athens and northern Greece.\n\nHowever, Constantine's plans were overly bureaucratic, na\u00efvely supposing that orders from a commanding general would automatically be obeyed.\n\nIn the circumstances, middle-ranking pro-junta officers neutralised and arrested Constantine's royalist generals and took command of their units, and subsequently put together a force to advance on Kavala to arrest the King. The junta, not at all shaken by the loss of their figurehead premier, ridiculed Constantine by announcing that he was hiding \"from village to village\". Realising that the counter-coup had failed, Constantine fled Greece on board the royal plane, taking his family and the helpless Kollias with him. They landed in Rome early in the morning of 14 December. Constantine remained in exile during the remainder of military rule. Although he subsequently returned to Greece, the abolition of the monarchy in 1973 removed his status as King.\n\nThe flight of Constantine and Kollias left Greece with no legal government or head of state. This did not concern the military junta. Instead the Revolutionary Council, composed of Pattakos, Papadopoulos, and Makarezos, appointed another member to the military administration, Major General Georgios Zoitakis, as Regent. Zoitakis then appointed Papadopoulos as prime minister. This became the only government of Greece following the failure of the King's attempted counter-coup, as Constantine was unwilling to set up an alternative administration in exile. \n\nIn hopes of giving legal sanction to the regime, the junta drafted a new constitution. It made the military the guardians of \"social and political order,\" with wide autonomy from governmental and parliamentary oversight. It also heavily circumscribed the activities of political parties. The new constitution was approved in a 15 November referendum, with over 92 percent approval. However, the referendum was conducted in less-than-free circumstances; the regime deployed extensive propaganda in favour of the new document while muzzling any opposition. Under the new constitution, the regency would continue until elections were held, unless the junta called Constantine back sooner (though Constantine never acknowledged, let alone recognised, the regency). However, the junta announced that the \"Revolution of April 21\" (as the regime called itself) would need time to reform the \"Greek mentality\" before holding elections. It also suspended most of the constitution's guarantees of civil rights until the restoration of civilian rule.\n\nIn a legally controversial move, even under the junta's own Constitution, the Cabinet voted on 21 March 1972 to oust Zoitakis and replace him with Papadopoulos, thus combining the offices of Regent and Prime Minister. It was thought Zoitakis was problematic and interfered too much with the military. The King's portrait remained on coins, in public buildings, etc., but slowly, the military chipped away at the institution of the monarchy: the royal family's tax immunity was abolished, the complex network of royal charities was brought under direct state control, the royal arms were removed from coins, the Navy and Air Force dropped their \"Royal\" names, and newspapers were prohibited from publishing the King's photo or any interviews.\n\nDuring this period, resistance against the colonels' rule became better organized among exiles in Europe and the United States. There was also considerable political infighting within the junta. Still, up until 1973, the junta appeared in firm control of Greece, and not likely to be ousted by violent means.\n\nThe colonels preferred to call the coup an (, 'revolution to save the nation'). Their official justification was that a \"communist conspiracy\" had infiltrated Greece's bureaucracy, academia, press, and military, to such an extent that drastic action was needed to protect the country from communist takeover. Thus, the defining characteristic of the Junta was its staunch anti-communism. They used the term (, 'anarcho-communist') to describe leftists in general. In a similar vein, the junta attempted to steer Greek public opinion not only by propaganda but also by inventing new words and slogans, such as (, 'old-partyism') to discredit parliamentary democracy, or (, 'Greece for Christian Greeks') to underscore its ideology. The junta's main ideological spokesmen included Georgios Georgalas and journalist Savvas Konstantopoulos, both former Marxists. \n\nIn 1970, Georgalas published a book \"The Decline of Consumer Society\", stating the consumerism had destroyed the Christian spiritual values of the West, leaving Greece as the last solitary outpost of Christian civilization. In the same book, Georgalas stated the solution to social problems was not as many believed increased employment, but instead \"lengthy psycho-therapeutic programmes\" which would create \"the free man in harmonious co-existence with himself and his fellow beings\". The British historian Richard Clogg described the writings of Georgalas and Konstantopoluos as \"pretentious verbiage\", noting that they tended to use elaborate and impressive-sounding language to mask the shallowness of their theories. In essence, intellectuals like Georgalas and Konstantopoulos argued that materialism and consumerism was corroding the spiritual strength of the Greek people, and the military regime would \"cure\" the Greeks by restoring the traditional values of Orthodoxy. One of Papadopoulos' first acts after the coup was to change the pension laws to allow the veterans of the Security Battalions to collect pensions.\n\nA central part of the regime's ideology was xenophobia, which presented Greeks of the creators of civilization with the rest of the world jealous of the debts they owed to Greece. Colonel Ioannis Ladas, the Secretary-general of the Ministry of Public Order, came to international prominence in the summer of 1968 when he personally beat up Panayiotis Lambrias, the editor of magazine \"Eikones\" for running an article saying that homosexuality was accepted as normal in ancient Greece. When the BBC's Greek service reported the incident, Ladas gave a rant at a press conference, claiming that the BBC was run by homosexuals, making him into a sort of unofficial spokesman for the regime. \n\nAt a subsequent speech before a visiting group of Greek-Americans on 6 August 1968, Ladas quoted Friderich Nietzsche's statement that the ancient Greeks invented everything and went on to say: \"Foreigners confess and acknowledge Greek superiority. Human civilization was wholly fashioned by our race. Even the enemies of Greece recognize that civilization is an exclusively Greek creation\". Ladas went on to denounce young men with long hair as \"the degenerate phenomenon of hippyism\", calling hippies \"anti-social elements, drug addicts, sex maniacs, thieves, etc. It is only natural that they should be enemies of the army and the ideals which the military way of life serves\". Ladas ended his speech by arguing that Greeks for racial reasons were still the world's preeminent people, but had only declined of inadequate leadership, a problem which had been solved by the \"revolution\" of 21 April 1967. Ladas claimed that Greece under military leadership would be \"cured\" of its problems and resume its rightful place in the world. Clogg noted that before the coup, Ladas had been associated with the far-right 4th of August Party, and contributed many articles to that party's journal, which was a \"racist and anti-Semitic\" magazine which glorified not only the 4th of August Regime, but also the Third Reich. \n\nThe Greek novelist Yiorgos Theotokas once coined the term (, 'ancestoritis') to describe an obsession with the heritage of the past, which many felt that Papadopoulos and the rest of the junta suffered from. Papadopoulos often described the Greeks in his speeches as the \"elect of God\", claiming the regenerated \"\" ('Greece for Christian Greeks') would be the example to the rest of the world as maintained that people all over the world would regard his ideology of \"Helleno-Christian civilization\" alongside the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle as the summit of intellectual achievement.\n\nThroughout his tenure as the junta strongman, Papadopoulos often employed what have been described by the BBC as gory medical metaphors, where he or the junta assumed the role of the \"medical doctor\". The supposed \"patient\" was Greece. Typically Papadopoulos or the junta portrayed themselves as the \"doctor\" who operated on the \"patient\" by putting the patient's \"foot\" in an orthopedic cast and applying restraints on the \"patient\", tying him on a surgical bed and putting him under anesthesia to perform the \"operation\" so that the life of the \"patient\" would not be \"endangered\" during the operation. In one of his famous speeches Papadopoulos mentioned: \nIn the same speech Papadopoulos continued: \n\nOther metaphors contained religious imagery related to the resurrection of Christ at Easter: \"\" (\"Christ has risen \u2013 Greece has risen\"), alluding that the junta would save Greece and resurrect her into a greater, new Land. The theme of rebirth was used many times as a standard reply to avoid answering any questions as to how long the dictatorship would last:\n\nThe religious themes and rebirth metaphors are also seen in the following:\nAs soon as the \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" was announced over Greek radio, martial music was continuously broadcast over the airwaves. This was interrupted from time to time with announcements of the junta issuing orders, which always started with the introduction, (, 'We decide and we order'). Long-standing political freedoms and civil liberties, that had been taken for granted and enjoyed by the Greek people for decades, were instantly suppressed. Article 14 of the Greek Constitution, which protected freedom of thought and freedom of the press, was immediately suspended. Military courts were established, and political parties were dissolved. Legislation that took decades to fine tune and multiple parliaments to enact was thus erased in a matter of days. The rapid dismantling of Greek democracy had begun.\n\nIn fact, the junta crackdown was so fast that by September 1967, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands went before the European Commission of Human Rights to accuse Greece of violating most of the human rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. Following the coup, 6,188 suspected communists and political opponents were imprisoned or exiled to remote Greek islands within the first week after the coup.\n\nUnder the junta, torture became a deliberate practice carried out both by the Security Police and the Greek Military Police (ESA), with an estimated 3,500 people detained in torture centres run by ESA. Commonly used methods of torture included, but were not limited to, beating the soles of detainees' feet, sexual torture, choking and ripping out body hair. The Special Interrogation Unit of the Greek Military Police (EAT/ESA) used a combination of techniques that included continuous standing in an empty room, sleep and food deprivation, beatings and loud sounds.\n\nAccording to recent research based on new interviews with survivors, in the period from May to November 1973 this combination of interrogation techniques also included the repetition of songs that were popular hits of the time. These were played loudly and repeatedly from loudspeakers. These methods attacked the senses without leaving any visible traces and have been classified since as torture by international organisations.\n\nAccording to a human rights report by Amnesty International, in the first month of the 21 April coup an estimated 8,000 people were arrested. James Becket, an American attorney and author of \"Barbarism in Greece\", was sent to Greece by Amnesty International. He wrote in December 1969 that \"a conservative estimate would place at not less than two thousand\" the number of people tortured.\n\nThe citizens' right of assembly was revoked and no political demonstrations were allowed. Surveillance on citizens was a fact of life, even during permitted social activities. That had a continuously chilling effect on the population who realised that, even though they were allowed certain social activities, they could not overstep the boundaries and delve into or discuss forbidden subjects. This realisation, including the absence of any civil rights as well as maltreatment during police arrest, ranging from threats to beatings or worse, made life under the junta a difficult proposition for many ordinary citizens. Photography by ordinary citizens was banned in public locations.\n\nThe junta allowed citizens to participate in ordinary societal events that reflected those of the United States and United Kingdom, such as rock concerts for example. However, citizens lived in extreme fear, as any behavior that the junta disapproved of, coupled with the complete absence of any civil rights or freedoms, could easily result in torture, beatings, exile, imprisonment, or worse, and the labeling of the victims as anarcho-communists, or worse. The absence of a valid code of jurisprudence led to the unequal application of the law among the citizens and to rampant favouritism and nepotism. Absence of elected representation meant that the citizens' stark and only choice was to submit to these arbitrary measures exactly as dictated by the junta. The country had become a true police state. Thousands were jailed for political reasons by the dictatorship and thousands were forced into exile. More than 10,000 were estimated to have been arrested in the first few days after the coup.\n\nComplete lack of press freedom coupled with nonexistent civil rights meant that continuous cases of civil rights abuses could neither be reported nor investigated by an independent press or any other reputable authority. This led to a psychology of fear among the citizens during the Papadopoulos dictatorship, which became worse under Ioannidis.\n\nThe military government was given support by the United States as a Cold War ally, due to its proximity to the Eastern European Soviet bloc, and the fact that the previous Truman administration had given the country millions of dollars in economic aid to discourage Communism. U.S. support for the junta, which was staunchly anti-Communist, is claimed to be the cause of rising anti-Americanism in Greece during and following the junta's undemocratic rule.\n\nThere was a mixed response to the junta from Western Europe. The Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands filed a complaint before the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe in September 1967. The Commission on Human Rights took the exceptional step of constituting a Sub-Commission to investigate the accusations of gross human rights abuses. The sub-commission reported its extensive on-site investigation and unearthed significant evidence of torture and human rights violations. Greece however opted to leave the Council of Europe in December 1969 before a full verdict of the Commission could be handed down.\n\nCountries such as the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany on the other hand were voicing criticism about Greece's human rights record but supported the country's continued membership in the Council of Europe and NATO because of the country's strategic value for the western alliance.\n\nTo gain support for his rule, Papadopoulos projected an image that appealed to some key segments of Greek society. The son of a poor but educated rural family, he was educated at the prestigious Hellenic Military Academy. Papadopoulos allowed substantial social and cultural freedoms to all social classes, but political oppression and censorship were at times heavy-handed, especially in areas deemed sensitive by the junta, such as political activities, and politically related art, literature, film and music. Kostas Gavras's film \"Z\" and Mikis Theodorakis's music, among others, were never allowed even during the most relaxed times of the dictatorship, and an index of prohibited songs, literature and art was kept.\n\nRemarkably, after some initial hesitation and as long as they were not deemed to be politically damaging to the junta, junta censors allowed wide access to Western music and films. Even the then-racy West German film \"Helga\", a 1967 sex education documentary featuring a live birth scene, had no trouble making its debut in Greece just like in any other Western country. Moreover, the film was only restricted for those under 13 years of age. In 1971 Robert Hartford-Davis was allowed by the junta to film the classic horror film \"Incense for the Damned\", starring Peter Cushing and Patrick Macnee and suitably featuring (), a beguiling Greek siren with vampire tendencies, on the Greek island of Hydra. In 1970 the film \"Woodstock\" was shown all over Greece, with reports of arrests and disturbances especially in Athens as many youths flocked to see the film and filled theatres to capacity, while many others were left outside. Films such as \"Marijuana Stop!\" dealt with the hippie culture and its perception in Greek society as drug-using.\n\nMeanwhile, at Matala, Crete, a hippie colony which had been living in the caves since the 1960s, was never disturbed. Singer songwriter Joni Mitchell was inspired to write the song \"Carey\" after staying in the Matala caves with the hippie community in 1971. Hippie colonies also existed in other popular tourist spots such as \"Paradise Beach\" in Mykonos.\n\nDuring its rule, the dictatorship heavily utilized folk music in mass media in order to help solidify the relationship between the junta and Greek national identity, in turn legitimizing its rule over the country. The regime sponsored song contests and concerts featuring folk musicians throughout its existence. The favored types of music employed by the government were those which accompanied the Kalamatianos and Tsamiko folk dances. Additionally, the regime encouraged the production of new folk songs with lyrics praising the government and its leaders, like Georgios Papadopoulos. Because the clarinet was so strongly featured in the music of the Junta, it remains associated with the Colonels by many Greeks today. The ideology behind the promotion of folk music was twofold: to bridge the gap of continuity with Greece's past and present, and to limit foreign cultural influences such as psychedelic music (which could hold political connotations contrary to those of the Junta) by substituting them with traditionally Greek ones. Folk music was also used as an ideological weapon against dissidents, and it was played constantly in detention centers to help break prisoners.\n\nIn the early days of the dictatorship, Western music broadcasts were limited from the airwaves in favour of martial music, but this was eventually relaxed. In addition, pop/rock music programmes such as the one hosted by famous Greek music/radio/television personality and promoter Nico Mastorakis were very popular throughout the dictatorship years both on radio and television. Most Western record sales were similarly not restricted. In fact, even rock concerts and tours were allowed such as by the then popular rock groups Socrates Drank the Conium and Nostradamos.\n\nAnother pop group, Poll, was a pioneer of Greek pop music in the early 1970s. Its lead singer and composer was Robert Williams, who was later joined, in 1971, by Kostas Tournas. Poll enjoyed a number of nationwide hits, such as \" (Mankind Love One Another)\", an anti-war song composed by Tournas, and \" (Come, My Sun)\", composed by Tournas, Williams. Tournas later pursued a solo career and in 1972 produced the progressive psychedelic hit solo album (, 'Infinite Fields'). He wrote and arranged the album using an orchestra and a rock group (\"Ruth\") combination, producing a rock opera which is considered a landmark of Greek rock. In 1973 Kostas Tournas created the album (\"Stardreams\"), influenced by David Bowie's \"Ziggy Stardust\".\n\nSongwriter Dionysis Savvopoulos, who was initially imprisoned by the regime, nevertheless rose to great popularity and produced a number of influential and highly politically allegorical, especially against the junta, albums during the period, including (, 'The Madman's Orchard'), (, the name of Greek folk dance) and (, 'Dirty Bread').\n\nConcurrently, tourism was actively encouraged by Papadopoulos' government and, funding scandals notwithstanding, there was great development of the tourist sector. With tourism came nightlife. However, under Papadopoulos, in the absence of any civil rights these sociocultural freedoms existed in a legal vacuum that meant they were not guaranteed, but rather dispensed at the whim of the junta. In addition any transgressing into political matters during social or cultural activities usually meant arrest and punishment. Tourism was furthered by the 1969 European Championships in Athletics in Athens which showed political normality. Even the boycott of the West German team was not directed against the junta, but against its own team leadership. Although discos and nightclubs were, initially, subjected to a curfew, partially due to an energy crisis, this was eventually extended from 1:00\u00a0a.m. to 3:00\u00a0a.m. as the energy crisis eased. These freedoms were later reversed by Dimitrios Ioannidis after his coup.\n\nThe farmers were Papadopoulos' natural constituency and were more likely to support him, seeing him, because of his rural roots, as one of their own. He cultivated this relationship by appealing to them, calling them (, 'the backbone of the people') and cancelling all agricultural loans. By further insisting on promoting, but not really enforcing for fear of middle-class backlash, religion and patriotism, he further appealed to the simpler ideals of rural Greece and strengthened his image as people's champion among farmers, who tended to ridicule the middle class. Furthermore, the regime promoted a policy of economic development in rural areas, which were mostly neglected by the previous governments, that had focused largely on urban industrial development.\n\nPapadopoulos was less likely to appeal to the largely civilian and city-oriented middle class, since he was a military man from a rural background. In addition, he had promised from the beginning that the dictatorship would not be permanent, and that when political order was established democratic rule would return. On top of that, his promotion of tourism and other beneficial economic measures and the fact that, with the notable exceptions of political freedoms and press censorship, he did not otherwise substantially restrict the middle class, had the effect of assisting the junta in establishing its control over the country by gaining, at least initially, the reluctant acquiescence of some key segments of the population.\n\nThe 1967\u20131973 period was marked by high rates of economic growth coupled with low inflation and low unemployment. Economic growth was driven by investment in the tourism industry, loose emigration policies, public spending, and pro-business incentives that fostered both domestic and foreign capital spending. Several international companies invested in Greece at the time, including The Coca-Cola Company. Economic growth started losing steam by 1972.\n\nIn addition, large scale construction of hydroelectric dam projects, such as in Aliakmon, Kastrakion, Polyphytos, the expansion of thermoelectric generation units and other significant infrastructure development, took place. The junta used to proudly announce these projects with the slogan: (, 'Greece is a construction zone'). The always smiling Stylianos Pattakos, also known as (, 'the first trowel of Greece'), since he frequently appeared at project inaugurations with a trowel in hand, starred in many of the propaganda documentaries that were screened before feature film presentation in Greek cinemas.\n\nCases of non-transparent public deals and corruption allegedly occurred at the time, given the lack of democratic checks and balances and the absence of a free press. One such event is associated with the regime's tourism minister, Ioannis Ladas. During his administration, several low-interest loans, amortized over a twenty-year period, were issued for tourist development. This fostered the erection of a multitude of hotels, sometimes in non-tourist areas, and with no underlying business rationale. Several such hotels were abandoned unfinished as soon as the loans were secured, and their remains still dot the Greek countryside. These questionable loans are referred to as (, 'loans of the sea'), to indicate the loose terms under which they were granted.\n\nAnother contested policy of the regime was the writing-off of agricultural loans, up to a value of 100,000 drachmas, to farmers. This has been attributed to an attempt by Papadopoulos to gain public support for his regime.\n\nAt the time, the Italian far right was very impressed with the methods of Papadopoulos and his junta. In April 1968 Papadopoulos invited fifty Italian members of the far right including Stefano Delle Chiaie on a Greek tour with the purpose of demonstrating to the Italians the methods of the junta. Other invitees included members of Ordine Nuovo, Avanguardia Nazionale, Europa Civilt\u00e0 and FUAN-La Caravella. (cf Frattini, Entity, 2004, p. 304) The Italians were sufficiently impressed that upon return to their country, the operatives of the Italian far right escalated the political violence in their country to a new level embarking on a terror campaign of bombings and other violence which killed and injured hundreds. Afterwards, the right-wing instigators of this violence blamed the communists.\n\nAfter their visit to Greece, the Italian neo-fascists also engaged in false flag operations and embarked on a campaign of infiltration of leftist, anarchist and Marxist\u2013Leninist organisations. One of the neo-fascists conducted frequent provocations and infiltrations in the months leading to the Piazza Fontana bombing on 12 December 1969. The Greek junta was so impressed with the manner their Italian counterparts were paving the way toward an Italian coup d'\u00e9tat that on 15 May 1969 Papadopoulos sent them a congratulatory message stating that \"His Excellency the Prime Minister notes that the efforts that have been undertaken by the Greek National government in Italy for some time start to have some impact\".\n\nThe democratic elements of the Greek society were opposed to the junta from the start. In 1968 many militant groups promoting democratic rule were formed, both in exile and in Greece. These included, among others, Panhellenic Liberation Movement, Democratic Defense, the Socialist Democratic Union, as well as groups from the entire left wing of the Greek political spectrum, including the Communist Party of Greece which had been outlawed even before the junta. The first armed action against the junta was the failed assassination attempt against George Papadopoulos by Alexandros Panagoulis, on 13 August 1968.\n\nThe assassination attempt took place on the morning of 13 August, when Papadopoulos went from his summer residence in Lagonisi to Athens, escorted by his personal security motorcycles and cars. Alexandros Panagoulis ignited a bomb at a point of the coastal road where the limousine carrying Papadopoulos would have to slow down, but the bomb failed to harm Papadopoulos. Panagoulis was captured a few hours later in a nearby sea cave, as the boat that would let him escape the scene of the attack had not shown up.\n\nPanagoulis was transferred to the Greek Military Police (EAT-ESA) offices, where he was questioned, beaten and tortured (see the proceedings of Theofiloyiannakos's trial). On 17 November 1968 he was sentenced to death, and remained in prison for five years. After the restoration of democracy, Panagoulis was elected a Member of Parliament. Panagoulis is regarded as an emblematic figure for the struggle to restore democracy.\n\nThe funeral of George Papandreou, Sr. on 3 November 1968 spontaneously turned into a massive demonstration against the junta. Thousands of Athenians disobeyed the military's orders and followed the casket to the cemetery. The government reacted by arresting 41 people.\n\nOn 28 March 1969, after two years of widespread censorship, political detentions and torture, Giorgos Seferis, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963, took a stand against the junta. He made a statement on the BBC World Service, with copies simultaneously distributed to every newspaper in Athens. Attacking the colonels, he passionately demanded that \"This anomaly must end\". Seferis did not live to see the end of the junta. His funeral, though, on 20 September 1972, turned into a massive demonstration against the military government.\n\nAlso in 1969, Costa-Gavras released the film \"Z\", based on a book by celebrated left-wing writer Vassilis Vassilikos. The film, banned in Greece, presented a lightly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of United Democratic Left MP Gregoris Lambrakis in 1963. The film captured the sense of outrage about the junta. The soundtrack of the film was written by Mikis Theodorakis, who was imprisoned by the junta and later went into exile, and the music was smuggled into the country to be added to the other inspirational, underground Theodorakis tracks.\n\nA lesser known Danish film, in Greek, \"Your Neighbor's Son\", detailed the subordination and training of simple youths to become torturers for the junta.\n\nThe junta exiled thousands on the grounds that they were communists and/or \"enemies of the country\". Most of them were subjected to internal exile on Greek deserted islands, such as Makronisos, Gyaros, Gioura, or inhabited islands such as Leros, Agios Eustratios or Trikeri. \nThe most famous were in external exile, most of whom were substantially involved in the resistance, organising protests in European capital cities, or helping and hiding refugees from Greece.\n\nThese included: Melina Mercouri, actor, singer (and, after 1981 Minister for Culture); Mikis Theodorakis, composer of resistance songs; Costas Simitis (prime minister from 1996 to 2004); Andreas Papandreou (prime minister from 1981 to 1989 and again from 1993 to 1996); and Lady Amalia Fleming (wife of Sir Alexander Fleming, philanthropist, political activist). Some chose exile, unable to stand life under the junta. For example, Melina Mercouri was allowed to enter Greece, but stayed away on her own accord.\n\nIn the early hours of 19 September 1970 in Matteotti square in Genoa, geology student Kostas Georgakis set himself ablaze in protest against the dictatorship of George Papadopoulos. The junta delayed the arrival of his remains to Corfu for four months, fearing public reaction and protests. At the time his death caused a sensation in Greece and abroad as it was the first tangible manifestation of the depth of resistance against the junta. He is the only known anti-junta resistance activist to have sacrificed himself and he is considered the precursor of later student protest, such as the Athens Polytechnic uprising. The Municipality of Corfu has dedicated a memorial in his honour near his home in Corfu city.\n\nIn a speech before the U.S. Senate on 6 November 1971, Senator Lee Metcalf listed the members of the Greek junta who had served in the collaborationist Security Battalions and denounced the administration of Richard Nixon for supporting what he called a \"junta of Nazi collaborators\". The German writer, investigative reporter and journalist G\u00fcnter Wallraff traveled to Greece in May 1974. While in Syntagma Square, he protested against human right violations. He was arrested and tortured by the police, as he did not carry, on purpose, any papers on him that could identify him as a foreigner. After his identity was revealed, Wallraff was convicted and sentenced to 14 months in jail. He was released in August, after the end of the dictatorship.\n\nIn an anti-junta protest, on 23 May 1973, HNS \"Velos\", under the command of Commander Nikolaos Pappas, refused to return to Greece after participating in a NATO exercise and remained anchored at Fiumicino, Italy. During a patrol with other NATO vessels between continental Italy and Sardinia, the commander and the officers heard over the radio that a number of fellow naval officers had been arrested in Greece. Commander Pappas was involved in a group of democratic officers who remained loyal to their oath to obey the Constitution and planned to act against the junta. Evangelos Averoff also participated in the \"Velos\" mutiny, for which he was later arrested as an \"instigator\".\n\nPappas believed that since his fellow anti-junta officers had been arrested, there was no more hope for a movement inside Greece. He therefore decided to act alone in order to motivate global public opinion. He mustered all the crew to the stern and announced his decision, which was received with enthusiasm by the crew.\n\nPappas signaled his intentions to the squadron commander and NATO headquarters, quoting the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty, which declares that \"all governments ... are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law\", and, leaving formation, sailed for Rome. There, anchored about away from the coast of Fiumicino, three ensigns sailed ashore with a whaleboat, went to Fiumicino Airport and telephoned the international press agencies, notifying them of the situation in Greece, the presence of the destroyer, and that the captain would hold a press conference the next day.\n\nThis action increased international interest in the situation in Greece. The commander, six officers, and twenty five petty officers requested permission to remain abroad as political refugees. Indeed, the whole crew wished to follow their commander but were advised by its officers to remain onboard and return to Greece to inform families and friends about what happened. \"Velos\" returned to Greece after a month with a replacement crew. After the fall of the junta all officers and petty officers returned to the Navy.\n\nThe collapse of the junta both ideologically and politically was triggered by a series of events which unfolded soon after Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, with ideological collapse preceding its eventual political collapse. During and following this ill-fated process the internal political strains of the junta came to the fore and pitted the junta factions against each other, thus destroying the seemingly monolithic cohesion of the dictatorship.\n\nThis had the effect of seriously weakening the coherence of the political message and, consequently, the credibility of the regime, a fatal blow from which, as later events would show, it never recovered. At the same time, during Papadopoulos' attempt at liberalisation, some of the junta constraints were removed from the body politic of Greece and that led to demands for more freedoms, and political unrest, in a society well used to democratic action prior to the dictatorship.\n\nPapadopoulos had indicated as early as 1968 that he was eager for a reform process. He had declared at the time that he did not want the \"Revolution\" (junta speak for the \"dictatorship\") to become a \"regime\". He then repeatedly attempted to initiate reforms in 1969 and 1970, only to be thwarted by the hardliners including Ioannidis. In fact subsequent to his 1970 failed attempt at reform, he threatened to resign and was dissuaded only after the hardliners renewed their personal allegiance to him.\n\nOn 10 April 1970 Papadopoulos announced the formation of the (\",\" Advisory Council\"') otherwise known as \"Papadopoulos' (pseudo) Parliament\". Composed of members elected through an electoral type process but limited only to (, 'regime supporters'), it was bicameral, composed of the Central Advisory Council and the Provincial Advisory Council. The Central Council met in Athens in the Parliament Building. Both councils had the purpose to advise the dictator. At the time of the announcement of the formation of the council, Papadopoulos explained that he wanted to avoid using the term (, 'Parliament') for the Committee because it sounded bad.\n\nThe council was dissolved just prior to Papadopoulos' failed attempt to liberalise his regime. As internal dissatisfaction grew in the early 1970s, and especially after an abortive coup by the Navy in early 1973, Papadopoulos attempted to legitimize the regime by beginning a gradual \"democratization\" (See also the article on Metapolitefsi).\n\nOn 1 June 1973, he abolished the monarchy and declared Greece a republic with himself as president. He was confirmed in office after a controversial referendum, the results of which were not recognised by the political parties. He furthermore sought the support of the old political establishment, but secured only the cooperation of Spiros Markezinis, who was appointed Prime Minister. Concurrently, many restrictions were lifted, and the army's role significantly reduced. Papadopoulos intended to establish a presidential republic, with extensive\u2013and within the context of the system, almost dictatorial\u2013powers vested in the office of President, which he held. The decision to return to political rule and the restriction of their role was resented by many of the regime's supporters in the Army, whose dissatisfaction with Papadopoulos would become evident a few months later.\n\nPapadopoulos' heavy-handed attempt at liberalisation did not find favour among many in Greece. The stilted democratisation process he proposed was constrained by multiple factors. His inexperience at carrying out an unprecedented political experiment of democratisation was burdened by his tendency to concentrate as much power in his hands as possible, a weakness he exhibited during the junta years when he would sometimes hold multiple high-echelon government portfolios. This especially antagonised the intelligentsia, whose primary exponents were the students. The students at the Law School in Athens, for example, demonstrated multiple times against the dictatorship prior to the events at the Polytechneion.\n\nThe tradition of student protest was always strong in Greece, even before the dictatorship. Papadopoulos tried hard to suppress and discredit the student movement during his tenure at the helm of the junta. But the liberalisation process he undertook allowed the students to organise more freely, and this gave the opportunity to the students at the National Technical University of Athens to organise a demonstration that grew progressively larger and more effective. The political momentum was on the side of the students. Sensing this, the junta panicked and reacted violently.\n\nIn the early hours of Saturday, 17 November 1973, Papadopoulos sent the army to suppress the student strike and sit-in of the (, 'Free Besieged'), as the students called themselves, at the Athens Polytechnic which had commenced on 14 November. Shortly after 3:00\u00a0a.m. EET, under almost complete cover of darkness, an AMX 30 tank crashed through the rail gate of the Athens Polytechnic with subsequent loss of life. The army also occupied Syntagma Square for at least the following day. Even the sidewalk cafes were closed.\n\nIoannidis' involvement in inciting unit commanders to commit criminal acts during the uprising, so that he could facilitate his own upcoming coup, was noted in the indictment presented to the court by the prosecutor during the Greek junta trials, and in his subsequent conviction in the Polytechneion trial where he was found to have been morally responsible for the events.\n\nThe uprising triggered a series of events that put an abrupt end to Papadopoulos' attempts at \"liberalisation\".\n\nBrigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis, a disgruntled junta hardliner and long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Papadopoulos as head of the feared Military Police, used the uprising as a pretext to reestablish public order, and staged a counter-coup that overthrew Papadopoulos and Spyros Markezinis on 25 November. Military law was reinstated, and the new Junta appointed General Phaedon Gizikis as President and economist Adamantios Androutsopoulos as Prime Minister, although Ioannidis remained the behind-the-scenes strongman.\n\nIoannidis's heavy-handed and opportunistic intervention had the effect of destroying the myth that the junta was an idealistic group of army officers with exactly the same ideals who came to save Greece by using their collective wisdom. The main tenet of the junta ideology (and mythology) was gone and so was the collective. By default, he remained the only man at the top after toppling the other three principals of the junta. Characteristically, he cited ideological reasons for ousting the Papadopoulos faction, accusing them with straying from the principles of the Revolution, especially of being corrupt and misusing their privileges as army officers for financial gains.\n\nPapadopoulos and his junta always claimed that the 21 April 1967 \"revolution\" saved Greece from the old party system. Now Ioannidis was, in effect, claiming that his coup saved the revolution from the Papadopoulos faction. The dysfunction as well as the ideological fragmentation and fractionalisation of the junta was finally out in the open. Ioannidis, however, did not make these accusations personally as he always tried to avoid unnecessary publicity. The radio broadcasts, following the now familiar \"coup in progress\" scenario featuring martial music interspersed with military orders and curfew announcements, kept repeating that the army was taking back the reins of power in order to save the principles of the revolution and that the overthrow of the Papadopoulos-Markezinis government was supported by the army, navy and air force.\n\nAt the same time they announced that the new coup was a \"continuation of the revolution of 1967\" and accused Papadopoulos with \"straying from the ideals of the 1967 revolution\" and \"pushing the country towards parliamentary rule too quickly\".\n\nPrevious to seizing power, Ioannidis preferred to work in the background and he never held any formal office in the junta. Now he was the \"de facto\" leader of a puppet regime composed by members some of whom were rounded up by Greek Military Police (ESA) soldiers in roving jeeps to serve and others that were simply chosen by mistake. The Ioannidis method of forming a government dealt yet another blow to the rapidly diminishing credibility of the regime both at home and abroad.\n\nThe new junta, despite its rather inauspicious origins, pursued an aggressive internal crackdown and an expansionist foreign policy.\n\nSponsored by Ioannidis, on 15 July 1974 a coup d'\u00e9tat on the island of Cyprus overthrew Archbishop Makarios III, the Cypriot president. Turkey replied to this intervention by invading Cyprus and occupying the northern part of the island, after heavy fighting with the Cypriot and Greek ELDYK Forces (, 'Greek Force for Cyprus'). During a military council, Ioannidis is reported to have said angrily to the American minister Joseph J. Sisco (who was present) \"You betrayed us! You had assured us that you would prevent any Turkish landing\".\n\nThere was a well-founded fear that an all-out war with Turkey was imminent. The Cyprus fiasco led to senior Greek military officers withdrawing their support for Junta strongman Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis. Junta-appointed President Phaedon Gizikis called a meeting of old guard politicians, including Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Spiros Markezinis, Stephanos Stephanopoulos, Evangelos Averoff, and others.\n\nThe agenda was to appoint a national unity government that would lead the country to elections. Although former Prime Minister Panagiotis Kanellopoulos was originally backed, on 23 July, Gizikis finally invited former Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis, who had resided in Paris since 1963, to assume the role. Karamanlis returned to Athens on a French Presidency Learjet made available to him by President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, a close personal friend, and was sworn-in as Prime Minister under President Phaedon Gizikis. Karamanlis' new party, New Democracy, won the November 1974 general election, and he became prime minister.\n\nParliamentary democracy was thus restored and the Greek legislative elections of 1974 were the first free elections held in a decade. A referendum held 8 December 1974 rejected re-establishment of the monarchy by a 2-to-1 margin, and Greece became a republic.\n\nWhile the physical collapse of the junta as a government was immediately caused by the Cyprus debacle, its ideological collapse was already triggered by the 1973 Athens Polytechnic uprising. The uprising at the Polytechneion was the event that discredited the military government most and acted as a key catalyst for its eventual demise by exposing the internal contradictions and stresses of the regime, thus destroying the myth of the political cohesion of the junta and, therefore, irreparably damaging the political credibility of the and its message.\n\nIn January 1975 the junta members were arrested and in early August of the same year the government of Konstantinos Karamanlis brought charges of high treason and insurrection against Georgios Papadopoulos and nineteen other co-conspirators of the military junta. The mass trial was staged at the Korydallos Prison. The trial was described as \"Greece's Nuremberg\". One thousand soldiers armed with submachine guns provided security. The roads leading to the jail were patrolled by tanks.\n\nPapadopoulos, Pattakos, Makarezos and Ioannidis were sentenced to death for high treason. These sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment by the Karamanlis government for humanitarian reasons. A plan to grant amnesty to the junta principals by the Konstantinos Mitsotakis government in 1990 was cancelled after protests from conservatives, socialists and communists.\n\nPapadopoulos died in the hospital in 1999 after being transferred from Korydallos while Ioannidis remained incarcerated until his death in 2010. This trial was followed by a second trial which centered on the events and the murders during the Athens Polytechnic uprising and a third called \"The trial of the torturers\".\n\nThe historical repercussions of the junta were profound and are still felt to this day in Greece. Internally the absence of civil rights and the oppression that followed created a sense of fear and persecution among many in the population creating trauma and division that persisted long after the fall of the junta. The Cyprus debacle created a tragedy that is still unfolding.\n\nWhile the Cyprus fiasco was due to the actions of Ioannidis, it was Papadopoulos who started the cycle of coups. Externally, the absence of human rights in a country belonging to the Western Bloc during the Cold War was a continuous source of embarrassment for the free world (considering Greece is seen as the inventor of democracy), and this and other reasons made Greece an international pariah abroad and interrupted its process of integration with the European Union with incalculable opportunity costs.\n\nThe 21 April regime remains highly controversial to this day, with most Greeks holding very strong and polarized views in regards to it. According to a survey by Kapa Research published in the centre-left newspaper \"To Vima\" in 2002, the majority of the electoral body (54.7%) consider the regime to have been bad or harmful for Greece while 20.7% consider it to have been good for Greece and 19.8% believe that it was neither good nor harmful. In April 2013, the Metron Analysis Poll, found that 30% of Greeks yearned for the \"better\" days of the Junta.\n\nThe experiences in Greece were formative for several CIA officers, including Clair George and Gust Avrakotos. Avrakotos, for example, dealt with the aftermath when Revolutionary Organization 17 November murdered his superior, CIA station chief Richard Welch in 1975. Many of his junta-connected associates were also assassinated in this time period. Avrakotos himself had his cover blown by the media and his life became endangered. In 1999, U.S. President Bill Clinton apologised on the behalf of the U.S. government for supporting the military junta in the name of Cold War tactics.\n\nThere has been speculation that lingering social effects of the junta played a role in the rise of Golden Dawn, an extreme right-wing party which gained eighteen seats in parliament in two successive elections in 2012, in the midst of Greece's ongoing debt crisis. Golden Dawn's leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, met the leaders of the junta while in prison and was inspired to lay the foundations for the party. Some have linked alleged support of Golden Dawn by Hellenic Police officers to the party's statements sympathizing with the junta, which commentators note would appeal to policemen whose livelihoods are threatened by harsh austerity measures.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Henry Essex Edgeworth (174522 May 1807), also known as L'Abb\u00e9 Edgeworth de Firmont, was an Irish Catholic priest and confessor of Louis XVI.\n\nHe was born in Edgeworthstown, County Longford, Ireland, the son of Robert Edgeworth, the Church of Ireland rector of Edgeworthstown. His mother Martha Ussher is often referred to as a granddaughter of Archbishop Ussher, but was in fact drawn from a different branch of that family. When he was about four, his father converted to Roman Catholicism, resigned his living and emigrated to Toulouse, where the boy was brought up by the Jesuits. In 1769, after his father's death, he went to Paris to be trained for the priesthood. On taking orders he assumed the additional surname of de Firmont, from the family estate of Firmount near Edgeworthstown.\n\nThough he originally studied with a view to becoming a missionary, he decided to remain in Paris, devoting himself especially to the Irish and English Roman Catholics. Through his father and the Archbishop of Paris he became vicar-general of the diocese of Paris and friend of the royal family and stayed with them during the French Revolution.\n\nIn 1791 he became confessor to the Princess Elizabeth, sister of Louis XVI, and earned the respect even of the \"sans-culottes\" by his courage and devotion. By Madame Elizabeth he was recommended to the king when Louis' trial was impending; and after Louis' condemnation to death he was able to obtain permission to celebrate mass for him and attend him on the scaffold, where he recommended the king to allow his hands to be tied, with the words: \"Sire, in this new outrage I see only the last trait of resemblance between your Majesty and the God who will be your reward.\" It is said that at the moment of the execution, the confessor uttered the celebrated words: \"Son of St Louis, ascend to heaven\" (although this is disputed; Edgeworth himself, in his memoirs, could neither affirm nor deny them).\n\nIn spite of the danger he now ran, Edgeworth refused to leave France so long as he could be of any service to Madame Elizabeth, with whom he still managed to correspond. At length, in 1795, his mother having meanwhile died in prison, where his sister was also confined, he succeeded in escaping to England, then Scotland, carrying with him Elizabeth's last message to her brother, the future King Charles X whom he found in Edinburgh. Henry's brother, Ussher, who resided near Edgeworthstown, along with relatives there (including novelist Maria Edgeworth), were keen for him to return to Ireland. Instead, he went with some papers to Monsieur (Louis XVIII) at Blankenburg in Brunswick, by whom he was induced to accompany him to Mittau, in Russia, where he died of a fever contracted while attending French prisoners in 1807. Louis XVIII wrote his epitaph, a copy of which, together with a letter of condolence, was sent by Louis' orders to Mr Ussher Edgeworth in Ireland.\n\nEdgeworth's \"M\u00e9moires\", edited by C. S. Edgeworth, were first published in English (London, 1815), and a French translation (really the letters and some miscellaneous notes, etc.) was published in Paris in 1816. A translation of the \"Lettres de l'abb\u00e9 Edgeworth avec des m\u00e9moires sur sa vie\" was published by Madame Elizabeth de Bow in Paris in 1818, and \"Letters from the Abb\u00e9 Edgeworth to his Friends, with Memoirs of his Life\", edited by Thomas Richard England, in London in 1818.\n\n"

    "title": "Reductive amination",
    "text": "Reductive amination (also known as reductive alkylation) is a form of amination that involves the conversion of a carbonyl group to an amine via an intermediate imine. The carbonyl group is most commonly a ketone or an aldehyde. It is considered the most important way to make amines, and a majority of amines made in the pharmaceutical industry are made this way.\n\nIn this organic reaction, the amine first reacts with the carbonyl group to form a hemiaminal species, which subsequently loses one molecule of water in a reversible manner by alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution, to form the imine. The equilibrium between aldehyde/ketone and imine can be shifted toward imine formation by removal of the formed water through physical or chemical means. This intermediate imine can then be isolated and reduced with a suitable reducing agent (e.g., sodium borohydride). This method is sometimes called indirect reductive amination.\nImine formation and reduction occur sequentially in one pot. This approach, known as direct reductive amination, employs reducing agents that are more reactive toward protonated imines than towards the ketone/aldehyde precursors. These hydride reagents also must tolerate moderately acidic conditions. Typical reagents that meet these criteria include sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBHCN) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(OCOCH)). This reaction can be performed in an aqueous environment, which casts doubt on the necessity of forming the imine. Possibly the reaction proceeds via reduction of the hemiaminal species.\n\nThis reaction is related to the Eschweiler\u2013Clarke reaction, in which amines are methylated to tertiary amines, the Leuckart\u2013Wallach reaction, or by other amine alkylation methods such as the Mannich reaction and Petasis reaction.\n\nA classic named reaction is the Mignonac reaction (1921) involving reaction of a ketone with ammonia over a nickel catalyst for example in a synthesis of 1-phenylethylamine starting from acetophenone: \nNowadays, one-pot reductive amination fulfil by acid-metal catalysts that act as a hydride transfer. Much research study on this kind of reaction show high efficiency.\n\nIn industry, tertiary amines such as triethylamine and diisopropylethylamine are formed directly from ketones with a gaseous mixture of ammonia and hydrogen and a suitable catalyst.\n\nA step in the biosynthesis of many \u03b1-amino acids is the reductive amination of an \u03b1-ketoacid, usually by a transaminase enzyme. The process is catalyzed by pyridoxamine phosphate, which is converted into pyridoxal phosphate after the reaction. The initial step entails formation of an imine, but the hydride equivalents are supplied by a reduced pyridine to give an aldimine, which hydrolyzes to the amine. The sequence from keto-acid to amino acid can be summarized as follows:\n\nIn the critically acclaimed drama Breaking Bad, main character Walter White uses the reductive amination reaction to produce his high purity methamphetamine, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine. The phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P) is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide (ThO2) as a catalyst.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Preston, Ontario",
    "text": "Preston is a community in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario. Prior to 1973 it was an independent city, incorporated in 1915, but amalgamation with the town of Hespeler, Ontario, the city of Galt, Ontario and the village of Blair formed the new municipality of Cambridge. Parts of the surrounding townships were also included. No population data is available for the former Preston since the Census reports cover only the full area of Cambridge, though the combined population of the census tracts covering the majority of Preston reported a population of 20,008 as of the 2016 Canada Census. The first mayor of Cambridge was Claudette Millar.\n\nThere was considerable resistance among the local population to this \"shotgun marriage\" arranged by the provincial government and a healthy sense of rivalry had always governed relations among the three communities. Even today, though many residents refer to their area of Cambridge as being Galt or Preston or Hespeler. Each unique centre has its own history that is well documented in the Cambridge City Archives.\n\nThe former Preston is located on the western side of the city at the confluence of the Grand River and Speed River. Downtown Preston is commonly considered to be bounded on the north by the entrance to Riverside Park on King Street, and on the south by the King and Bishop plaza.\n\nPreston was originally formed on land belonging to the German Company Tract, along the Speed River, which was purchased earlier from the Six Nations Indians. The name Preston is named for the hometown of William Scollick, who was surveyor and a native of Preston, Lancashire in England.\n\nIn the 1800s a group of German-speaking Mennonites from Pennsylvania arrived in the area and purchased land in the area. Among the first settlers to arrive in what was later to become Preston was John Erb, a Mennonite from Lancaster County, who arrived in 1805. He bought including land at the confluence of the Grand and Speed Rivers in what later became Preston.\n\nIt was John Erb who bought the of land and settled it in 1805. He later built a sawmill in 1806 and a gristmill in 1807. This settlement became known as Cambridge Mills.\n\nEven in the early 1800s, the area included homes, a store, an inn, small shops operated by artisans and craftsmen, mostly immigrants from Germany. The Erb sons had hired William Scollick for their development business and the latter completed a full survey in 1834 and convinced the Erbs to rename the Cambridge Mills area Preston. After Erb's death in 1832, a son sold off property on both sides of the Speed River. What eventually became Preston started as a large settlement on the north side.\n\nThere were only 250 inhabitants in 1836, many from Pennsylvania, but the population had reached about 1600 by 1855, with some 70% originally from Germany. By then, the area had eight hotels and taverns. Some of these hotels, such as the North American Hotel (later called the Kress and still standing) from the 1840s and the later Del Monte (most successful in the 1890s) and the Sulphur Springs, were built to accommodate visitors who arrived via the Great Road to benefit from the mineral springs. The high sulphur content was believed to be useful for those with arthritis and rheumatism.\n\nThe Canadian Gazetter of 1846 indicates a population of about 600 inhabitants, two churches, a post office that receives mail each day, a steam grist mill, and tradesmen of various types. At the time, there was no significant industry.\n\nThe Preston post office opened in 1837 and the population continued to grow primarily because of immigration from Germany. Preston was incorporated as a village in 1853. The population declined in the late 1800s but by 1900, it had increased to 2,000 partly because of the new electric railway systems that started in 1894. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover. This made visiting other communities and carrying of goods very convenient.\n\nDue to continued growth, by 1879 there were many industries such as a foundry, carriage manufacturer, potteries and a furniture company. This was also the year that the Cherry Flour Mills started, which would later become the Dover Flour Mills, a Preston company that still operates today.\n\nBy 1888, the Preston Springs Hotel, then called the Del Monte Hotel and owned by Robert Walder, was operating. The building still stands (but is vacant). In the late 19th century, it featured five acres of grounds with gardens and lawns. The primary draw was the mineral baths in the hotel's basement, said to \"cleanse\" the body. The high sulphur content was believed to be useful for those with arthritis and rheumatism. A competing facility, the Suplphur Springs Hotel, next door, opened in the mid 1890s, and a nearby hotel, the North American (renamed the Kress Hotel in 1900), had opened in 1840. Walder sold the Del Monte in 1903; a later owner, A.R. Kauffman, renamed it Preston Springs, and the facility remained successful as a health spa until 1940. After the war, it closed for some years, eventually becoming a retirement and care facility, until closing in 1990, when the building was boarded up. In 2000, some exterior repairs were completed but work stopped when the cost became excessive. The owner in mid-2018 was Haastown Holdings Preston Inc. A news report in January 2020 detailed the history of the property and stated that because it was no longer safe, the City of Cambridge had issued an order for demolition.\n\nOn September 30, 1899 Preston was incorporated as a town with a population of just under 11,000. The Great Road between Dundas and Berlin (Kitchener) as well as the railroad connections helped the community to continue growing into an important industrial centre. Products made here included flour, agricultural implements, furniture, stoves, shoes and textiles. Preston grew and continued to be a successful industrial area; expansion followed in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nWhile most of the population of what became Waterloo County, Ontario was Protestant in 1911, Preston had a larger share of Roman Catholics, 844, while 862 were Lutherans, 707 Methodists, 704 Anglicans, and 525 Presbyterians.\n\nThe local government is the Cambridge City Council consisting of a mayor and eight councillors, each representing a ward. The mayor (2014-2018 term) is Doug Craig.\nCambridge is also represented on the higher-tier Waterloo Regional Council which consists of the Regional Chair, the Mayors of the seven cities and townships, and eight additional Councilors - four from Kitchener and two each from Cambridge and Waterloo. Ken Seiling has held the position of Regional Chair since 1985.\n\nCambridge is represented in Ottawa by Bryan May (Liberal), the federal member of Parliament who defeated the previous incumbent MP (Gary Goodyear, Conservative \u2013 2004 to 2015) in the October 2015 election.\n\nThe MPP for Cambridge is Belinda Karahalios of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, who was first elected to this position in 2018.\n\nPrestion was an independent entity in Waterloo County, Ontario until 1973 when amalgamation created the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. At that time, Preston was amalgamated into the new city of Cambridge. The Region handles many services, including Fire, Police, waste management, community health, transit, recreation, planning, roads and social services.\n\nThe Region consists of the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo, and the townships of Woolwich, Wilmot, Wellesley, and North Dumfries.\n\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the Region of Waterloo has been provided by Grand River Transit, which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit.\n\nGRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge, four of which travel outside of the city: presently the 206 (Previously the 52), 61, 72, and 111 buses run to southern Kitchener, while the iXpress limited-stop express route runs from the Ainslie St. Transit Terminal (Galt) through Kitchener to the north end of Waterloo.\n\nIn June 2009 Regional Council voted to approve a plan to construct a light rail line, which has been named\nthe Ion rapid transit. The first phase would run from Conestoga Mall in the north of Waterloo, to Fairview Park Mall in the south of Kitchener.\n\nThe second phase of the line would run from Fairview Mall to the Galt area of Cambridge. Mayor Doug Craig was a determined opponent of the plan. He felt that a series of buses would be just as effective but much less expensive. As of late February 2017, the Kitchener-Waterloo portion was well into the final phase of construction, but plans for the Cambridge section of the LRT were still in the very early stage. Public consultations were just getting started at the time. Three routes had been agreed on in 2011, with eight \"endorsed\" stops: at Fairway, Sportsworld, Preston, Pinebush, Cambridge Centre Mall, Can-Amera, Delta and Ainslie Street Terminal. Three others were still being considered.\n\nPublic English-language schooling is provided by the Waterloo Region District School Board, which operates 26 elementary and five secondary schools in Cambridge.\n\nPublicly funded Catholic education is available through schools operated by the Waterloo Catholic District School Board.\n\nPreston is home to one high school, Preston High; one public middle school, William G Davis; as well as the elementary schools Preston Public, Coronation Public, Grandview Public, Parkway Public, Ryerson Public, St. Michael's Catholic and St. Joseph's Catholic.\n\nThe University of Waterloo School of Architecture campus is located in nearby Galt in the Riverside Silk Mill, also known as the Tiger Brand Building. Inside there is a theatre, a fitness room, and the gallery \"Design at Riverside\", which is one of two publicly funded galleries dedicated to architecture in Canada. The School of Architecture is home to 380 students who live, study, and learn within the Cambridge community.\n\nThe main park in Preston is Riverside Park. It is Cambridge's largest community park with an area of 256 acres (1.02\u00a0km\u00b2.) The park contains a splash pad, two playgrounds, tennis courts, soccer pitch, a skateboard park, picnic areas that can be reserved, and a multitude of walking trails. The baseball fields are used often and on Canada Day there is always an event at the field whether it is a fair, bands at a bandstand, or fireworks. Riverside Park also hosts a fishing derby on Canada Day when support is available.\n\nThe 7.5 kilometre Mill Run Trail runs north-east from the park at Russ Street, along the banks of the Speed River, to Sheffield Street in the town of Hespeler. On its way, it passes through the hamlet of Speedsville, the former site of Idylwild Park and Chilligo Conservation Area.\n\nAlso in Preston is Linear Park which has extensive trails for walking, running or biking. At certain points the trail gives a perfect view of the confluence of the Grand and the Speed Rivers.\n\nThis traditional downtown core area remains quite vibrant and through the B.I.A. has organized a closely knit group of merchants providing a wide range of goods and services in office-related industry, business service industries and licensed restaurants. The target market area is predominately the immediate surrounding residential area, which is constantly growing through new high density developments. In addition, high traffic counts through this area adds to the market potential.\n\nThe Grist Mill Centre including a new Giant Tiger Department store is a small commercial mall on King Street in Preston.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits",
    "text": "Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits is the first compilation album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 27, 1967 on Columbia Records, original catalogue number KCS 9463. It contains every Top 40 single Dylan enjoyed through 1967. It peaked at on the pop album chart in the United States, and went to on the album chart in the United Kingdom. Certified five times platinum by the RIAA, it is his best-selling album in the U.S.\n\n\"Greatest Hits\" presented Dylan's first appearance on records after his praised \"Blonde on Blonde\" double-LP of May 1966 and his motorcycle accident of that summer. With no activity by Dylan since the end of his recent world tour, and no new recordings on the immediate horizon (the sessions that would in part be later released as the \"Basement Tapes\" were still months away), Columbia needed new product to continue to capitalize on Dylan's commercial appeal. Hence the appearance of this package, the label's first Dylan compilation and its first LP release with a $5.98 list price, one dollar more than that of standard releases.\n\n\"Greatest Hits\" serves as Dylan's \"de facto\" singles collection for the 1960s. With the exception of \"The Times They Are a-Changin',\" \"It Ain't Me Babe,\" and \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" all tracks on this album were released as 45 RPM singles in the United States during that decade. It is worth noting that in 1963 \"Blowin' in the Wind\" became a #2 hit single for Peter, Paul and Mary, and that in 1965 \"Times\" made it to #9 as a single release in the United Kingdom. That same year of 1965 a truncated rock and roll version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" had been a number one hit for The Byrds in the summer, and the Turtles took a folk-rock version of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" to #8. The remaining six tracks all made the \"Billboard\" Top 40 in 1965 and 1966. \"Positively 4th Street\" was the only single of the collection not either later released on or taken off a long-playing album, having been recorded during the sessions for \"Highway 61 Revisited\".\n\nWhen this album was remastered for its 1999 issue on compact disc 30 years later, a slightly longer alternate mix of \"Positively 4th Street\" was substituted for the original single version. In 2003, this album was released along with Dylan's two other greatest hits compilations in one four-disc boxed set, as \"Greatest Hits Volumes I\u2013III\".\n\nAn audiophile version of the album was released in August 2012, mastered by Steve Hoffman for the Audio Fidelity label as a 24-kt gold-plated CD. This disc is a limited edition of 5,000 individually numbered copies. Like the 1999 remaster, this CD contains a longer version of \"Positively 4th Street.\"\n\nThe cover photograph used on the cover of \"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits\" was taken by Rowland Scherman at Dylan's November 28, 1965, concert in Washington, D.C. Bob Cato was the designer of the album cover, which won the 1967 Grammy award for \"Best Album Cover, Photography.\" The original album package also included Milton Glaser's now-familiar \"psychedelic\" poster depicting Dylan. A similar image taken at the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 was selected for \"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II\", a compilation Dylan had much more control over. John Berg, Senior Art Director at Columbia Records, recognized that a backlit image such as Scherman's would work because of Dylan's distinctive profile and hairstyle. It was his design, as well as Scherman's photo, that won the Grammy.\n\n\"All tracks written by Bob Dylan and all releases Columbia Records. Chart positions from \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In most cases the LP featured album versions in place of singles if such were not identical to single mixes.\"\n\nThe UK release of the album had a slightly different track listing. \"Positively 4th Street\" was omitted, but \"She Belongs to Me,\" \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,\" and \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\" were added. In the UK, this album was followed up by \"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits 2\", which repeated the \"Blonde on Blonde\" songs from the first \"Greatest Hits\" and also added \"Absolutely Sweet Marie,\" \"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,\" \"Gates of Eden,\" \"Chimes of Freedom,\" and several others. This album was different from the album called \"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II\" in the US, which was released in 1971 and called \"More Bob Dylan Greatest Hits\" in the UK.\n\n\n\n\"Subtitled \"Nobody sings Dylan like Dylan\", this version was compiled in 1966. Only half of the 12 songs are also on the U.S. release. Songs from \"Blonde on Blonde\" are missing altogether.\"\n\n"

    "title": "United Democratic Left",
    "text": "The United Democratic Left (, \"Eni\u00e9a Dimokratik\u00ed Arister\u00e1\" (EDA)) was a political party in Greece, active mostly before the Greek military junta of 1967\u201374.\n\nThe party was founded in July 1951 by prominent center-left and leftist politicians, some of which were former members of ELAS. While initially \"EDA\" was meant to act as a substitute and political front of the banned Communist Party of Greece, it eventually acquired a voice of its own, rather pluralistic and moderate. This development was more clearly shown at the time of the 1968 split in the ranks of Communist Party of Greece, with almost all former members of \"EDA\" joining the faction with Euro-communist, moderate tendencies.\n\n\"EDA\" participated in all the elections in Greece from 1952 until 1964. In the 1958 elections it managed to become the leading party of the opposition, an achievement all the more surprising in view of the recent end of the Greek civil war and the consequently prevailing anti-Left politics at the time.\n\nIn the 1961 election and 1964 election, \"EDA\" indirectly supported the Center Union against the National Radical Union (NRU). Before the 1963 election, Greece entered a protracted period of political and social unrest, with the assassination of \"EDA\" MP Gregoris Lambrakis, providing further inflammation. \"EDA\" and the Center Union accused prime minister Constantine Karamanlis and the NRU of the murder, which resulted in more (sometimes violent) manifestations. Karamanlis denounced his accusers, and warned that they contributed to the political instability of the country. An independent judicial inquiry held under public prosecutor Christos Sartzetakis concluded that those responsible for the assassination were far-right extremists linked with rogue elements in the Greek security forces. However, no specific instructions from the ruling political leadership were identified, nor proven in the subsequent trial of the perpetrators.\n\nWith the advent of the dictatorship of 1967, the party was outlawed by the regime and its members were persecuted.\n\nAfter the restoration of democracy, \"\u0395D\u0391\" reappeared in the elections of 1974 in an alliance with the Communist Party of Greece and the Communist Party of Greece (Interior), which were allowed to operate once again, and other leftist parties, under the leadership of Ilias Iliou, the most prominent politician of the Left in Greece at the time. Following a split in the alliance, \"\u0395D\u0391\" never participated independently in Greek politics again after 1977. Under the leadership of Manolis Glezos, the party took part in the elections of 1981 and 1985 in an alliance with and within the ranks of Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).\n\nWell-known politicians of EDA were:\n\n"

    "title": "Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage",
    "text": "Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage, released in Japan as , is a hack and slash action video game for the Dreamcast. It is based on the popular \"Berserk\" manga by Kentar\u014d Miura and the game is set between volume 22 and 23 of the manga; right after Guts and Puck depart for Elfhelm with Casca (chapter 182), but before Farnese, Serpico, and Isidro catch up with them (chapter 190). The music is composed by Susumu Hirasawa, who also composed the anime series' music.\n\nReleased around the same time as \"Shenmue\", \"Sword of the Berserk\" is notable for its early use of quick time events (QTE). It used these to determine the different non-linear paths the player would take, depending on whether they succeed or fail in pressing the displayed button quickly enough during a QTE, allowing different ways to complete the game.\n\nAfter saving a traveling performer named Rita from bandits while on their way to Elfhelm, Guts, Casca, and Puck come to a small castle town to rest. Upon arriving, they learn of a disease that transforms its victims into \"Mandragorans\", making them go berserk and kill people, even their loved ones, without thinking. The ruler of the castle, Baron Balzac, learns of Guts killing a Mandragoran and brings him to the dungeon where people infected with the disease are kept. Balzac brings Guts to his laboratory while explaining that he is searching for a supposed cure. Guts learns from Balzac that the disease comes from an unusual plant, the \"Mandragora\" that grew into a tree located in a nearby village on the borders of his domain. After meeting a group of rebels that abducted Casca and learning the baron is a tyrant to their people, Guts decides to carry out Balzac's request for the Great Tree's heart since the baron's findings might provide a cure for Casca's madness. But while Guts is joined by Rita and a group of rebels, Balzac's men raid the rebels' hideout and capture Casca.\n\nLosing their traveling companions while Guts confronts the Mandragorans' matriarch Erica, who maintained her free will to protect the Mandragora that grew from the remains of a boy named Niko, he and Rita find Balzac's men slaughtering the Mandragorans. Erica, upon seeing the utopia she created destroyed, chooses to destroy herself and the Mandragora Heart rather than hand the latter over with only the pendant she made from Niko's charm remaining as Rita picked it up. Guts was about to fight Balzac's men when Nosferatu Zodd arrives, the Apostle having freed Casca from her dungeon cell earlier, and they have a brief rematch that once more ends in a draw. By that time, encountering a young woman with a similar madness and assumed to be Balzac's daughter, Puck and Casca stumble into the chamber where the fragment of the Madragora Heart that Balzac obtained awakens. This causes all Mandragorans to act up and run amok in the town as Guts and Rita return.\n\nFighting his way through the Mandragorans and Balzac's forces to reach the castle, Guts and Rita see the mysterious girl and take her with them. When they finally reach Balzac's throne room, Guts demands to know where Casca is, but Balzac only answers that they are too late to save her. Rita asks Balzac how all of these events came to pass; he recounts that he was once a kind and just ruler, but the pressure of juggling his responsibilities as both a ruler and as a husband eventually got to him, and he now finds comfort only in bloodshed. Balzac also reveals the woman to be his wife, Annette. He had preserved her life with a drug extract made from the Mandragora's Heart, making her ageless, but at a steep price - the drug also ravaged her mind, rendering her unable to remember her own husband. Despite this, in his madness, Balzac drinks an even more potent extract of the Mandragora's Heart, transforming himself into a monstrous figure. Guts quickly dispatches him, however, and saves Casca from the fully grown Mandragora. In a cruel twist of fate, Casca's exposure to the Mandragora briefly restores her sanity - with Guts forced to watch her revert to her catatonic state once more. He is given little time to mourn this turn of events, however, as in the confusion of battle, Rita had dropped Erica's pendant - revealed to be a Behelit - and the dying Balzac had claimed it, offering Annette's life as his sacrifice in order to be reborn as an Apostle. Guts finds himself forced into battle once more, but manages to defeat the Apostle Balzac despite his new-found powers. With the town reverting to some normalcy, Guts and his group continue their journey; Rita promising to not forget them. Some time after Guts's group leave, the Skull Knight appears in Balzac's castle and swallows Balzac's Behelit.\n\n marked the return of Susumu Hirasawa, composer and performer of the soundtrack of the \"Sword-Wind Chronicle\" anime. Unlike the anime's soundtrack, Hirasawa composed and performed the game's opening theme, \"FORCES II\", and ending theme, \"INDRA\". Coincidentally, Hirasawa started his career as a musician with a band called Mandrake, and they made a song called \"Mandragora\". Hirasawa did not make all the original material for the game, part of the soundtrack was the work of Yuke's in-house musicians Masaya Imoto and Hiromi Murakami. Besides the songs that were commercially released, 39 other tracks ripped from the game's GD-ROM have been distributed online unofficially. The first-pressing limited edition of the soundtrack included the 2000 Berserk calendar and collector stickers. The soundtrack was reissued in 2012 as part of Hirasawa's \"Haldyn Dome\" boxset. Since it is a Hirasawa release, tracks 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10, which were made by Imoto and Murakami with no involvement from Hirasawa, were omitted from it.\n\n\"Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage\" received mostly positive reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 30 out of 40. In the UK, \"Official Dreamcast Magazine UK\" gave it a 73% score.\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"It controls reasonably well and looks fantastic \u2013 you'll get your money's worth \u2013 but the gameplay design is far from perfect, and there's too much exposition for the amount of action.\"\n\n"

    "title": "Overton, Hampshire",
    "text": "Overton is a large village and parish in Hampshire, England located west of the town of Basingstoke, and east of Andover and Whitchurch. The village contains smaller hamlets of Southington, Northington, Ashe, Polhampton and Quidhampton the latter two lying to the north of the village. The River Test has its source to the east in Ashe.\n\nThere is evidence of habitation since the Stone and Bronze Ages with finds and barrows located nearby.\n\nThe area has a history of banknote paper manufacture starting in the 18th century, and Overton Mill, as of March 2020, still produces the paper for pound sterling banknotes for the Bank of England.\n\nThe area around Overton has been inhabited for millennia with evidence of Stone Age, Bronze Age and Celtic occupation scattered across the parish and surrounding countryside, including tumuli at Popham Beacons at the southern tip of the parish; Abra Barrow on the boundary south west of Overton; a long barrow to the west of Willesley Warren Farm in the north of the parish; strip lynchets on Rotten Hill and the Harrow Way, an ancient track which runs across the parish north of the village.\n\nRoman occupation in the area is shown by the discovery of Roman pottery shards in Little Meadow and the Port Way Roman Road marks the northern boundary of the parish.\n\nThe development of the village began in earnest during the 10th century when Frithstan, the Bishop of Winchester, in a chartership dated 909, was granted \"Uferantun\" by King Edward the Elder. Overton developed over the next century and by the time of the Doomsday Book the settlement included a large number of dwellings, the Church of St Mary and several corn mills primarily due to its location on the River Test. By the 12th century Overton was a significant location with a royal residence, Tidgrove Kings House, being developed just north of Overton. The residence was built for Henry II for use on journeys between Windsor and either Winchester or Hamwych (Southampton) which was the customary port for travel to and from his French possessions. The importance and expansion continued throughout the 12th and 13th centuries facilitated in 1218 by Henry III providing a royal grant to the Bishop of Winchester for a market in \"his manor of Overton\" when burgage tenure was introduced. By this period Overton was becoming a major settlement on the north\u2013south route to and from Winchester.\n\nIn 1246 Henry III granted a fair on the \"\"eve, feast and morrow of the Translation of St. Thomas of Canterbury\"\" which can be considered as the first \"official\" sheep fair and by the late 13th century Overton had grown to such a size that in 1295 two representatives were sent to Parliament and by the early 14th century the town was providing a rent of \u00a312 0s 9\u00bdd to the bishopric (\"equivalent to \u00a32.75 million in 2015\").\n\nOverton was significantly impacted by the Black Death, rents fell by over a half, parliamentary representatives were withdrawn to save costs, the tourns (medieval courts) were not held and the population stagnated. Despite this stagnation Overton survived by consolidating farms and by support from the bishopric though the effects lasted until the end of the 14th century.\n\nBy the 15th century trade began to increase enough to support an inn and the White Hart, the oldest inn in Overton, was first recorded in 1442. In this period a new fulling mill was built and there was a large increase in population. It was in this period that Thomas Wolsey, Bishop of Winchester, obtained licence in 1519 to hold an additional fair at Overton on the \"\"eve, the feast and the morrow of the Feast of St. George the Marty\".\"\n\nBy the start of the 16th century a period of growth was established with expansion westward along the River Test. The economy in the area was still primarily agricultural based around sheep and corn; with the sheep fair recording 30,000 average sheep penned. The economy was also being bolstered by the increase of mills along the River Test including corn mills, fulling mills and silk mills.\n\nWith the increase in prosperity came a desire for greater power, the freeholders began to choose their own officers; port reeve, constable, bailiffs, beer-tasters and leather sealers at the court leet of the borough.\n\nDespite this in 1587 the Court of Chancery deemed that Overton should lose its charter as a town 'through neglect' and it reverted to being a village.\n\nA significant impact on Overton was the development of papermaking within the area by Henry Portal a French Huguenot who took the lease on Bere Mill on the River Test, between Overton and Whitchurch, in 1712.\n\nBy this time the focus of the village was the west\u2013east route from London to the West Country and in 1754 the road was turnpiked and what is now the High Street had a large number of inns to service the Stagecoach Passengers.\n\nIn 1805 Overton was one of the changes of horses for the post chaise of Lieutenant Lapenotiere, HMS \"Pickle\" who carried the historic dispatches of Lord Nelson's victory and death in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. This event is commemorated by the Trafalgar Way, the plaque being located on the village library.\n\nThe major impact on the village in the Victorian era was the arrival of the railways with the London and South Western Railway opening the West of England Main Line and Overton railway station in 1854. The railway caused problems for the local inns and the New Inn, which had only been built in 1770 was sold and demolished in 1860.\n\nThe vacant site of the New Inn was donated by George Lamb for the building of the new village school. Lamb paid for the building of the school and land for a separate infants school in Red Lion Lane. These two schools, opened in 1868 and 1871 served the town for nearly a hundred years when the junior and infants schools were combined at a new school in Court Drove.\n\nThe civil parish of Overton covers 3,471 hectares \u2013 an area about seven miles north to south (from Polhampton to the A303) and two and a half miles east to west (Ashe Park Lodge to Southington Lodge at Laverstoke Park) and is located in the County of Hampshire. Most of Overton parish is entirely rural with the north of the parish being in the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\n\nThe River Test, a chalk stream world-famous for its trout fishing, rises about a mile east of Overton at Ashe during normal rainfall conditions though the source can migrate eastwards as far as Oakley in a period of very heavy rainfall. The river flows westwards through the village, historically powering a number of mills, towards Whitchurch before it meanders southwards through Hampshire, eventually reaching the sea at Eling near Southampton.\n\nThe underlying geology \u2013 primarily chalk, with alluvial deposits adjacent to the river \u2013 results in typical chalk rolling countryside. The lowest parts of the village are about 80 meters above sea level, but the northern and southern extremities of the parish rise to between 160 and 200 meters, offering extensive views of the surrounding area.\n\nThe village is a civil parish and part of the Overton, Laverstoke and Steventon ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council.\n\nHenry Portal founded Portals Paper Mill at Bere Mill, on the River Test between Overton and Whitchurch, in 1712, adding Laverstoke Mill to his enterprise seven years later which allowed him to win the contract to make banknote paper for the Bank of England in 1724. Portals significantly expanded in the 20th Century with the development of a new Overton Mill near Quidhampton in 1922 and the Bank of England relocated a significant number of employees to the area during World War II.\n\nPapermaking is still undertaken within the village at the Overton Mill which produces high-security paper for over 150 national currencies. In 1995 the firm was sold to De La Rue and the Portals name was lost only for it to return in 2018 when De La Rue sold its papermaking assets to Epiris who resurrected the Portals name. \n\nThe historic Laverstoke Mill has been refurbished is now used by Bombay Sapphire with a visitors centre.\n\nThe location of the Portals Mill at Quidhampton has been referenced as the reason why \u00a31 is known as a \"Quid\", however there are many disputed origins and, given the various locations for Portals Papermills around the Overton area over the last three centuries, it is probably unlikely.\n\nOverton church, dedicated to St Mary, has medieval origins though the current church building is from the late Norman period in architecture.\n\nAlthough only the nave pillars remain of the original church, there is a record that in 1180 it had a nave of three bays. The old church probably had narrow aisles and a small chancel, the expansion of the church occurred in the 13C with new chancel windows, north and south, and possibly its\nsingle frame roof with tie beams. At that time the aisles of the nave were probably widened to give more room in the nave.\n\nFor many centuries the Bishop appointed a Rector of Overton church and parish, who very often did not live in it, and he in turn appointed a Vicar, who conducted services and was, in fact, 'the Parson'. The rectors and vicars since 1246 are recorded in a diptych board in the north aisle, near the door of the outer vestry.\n\nThe present aisles of the nave date from about a hundred years after the first names on that board. The great door of the main (south) entrance may similarly date from about 1350\u20131400. It may have been locally made, or perhaps only its lock and hinges are of local construction. The door is unusual in that it folds in the middle. The ornamented ironwork is said to be of Hampshire workmanship.\n\nIn the late 15th century the tower was rebuilt further west than an earlier one, and the nave and aisles were extended westward to meet it. The new tower had wooden board cladding at the belfry stage, and a timbered spire. The chancel was also enlarged at this time to its present length. On the inner sill of the north-west window in the chancel there is an inscription c.1400. It reads: \u2018Hic jacet d\u00b0. Willms Savage quondam rector istius ecciesie\u2019 \u2013 i.e. Here lies Dominus (Master) William Savage, formerly rector of this church. In 1609 the first two bells of the present ring were cast.\n\nIn 1853 the whole church was re-roofed and some of it rebuilt, however, the rebuilt tower did not last long. A huge crack soon appeared in it, so the spire was removed and the west wall was shored up with foot-square beams of oak at a cost of about \u00a31500. In 1908 the tower was again rebuilt with a spire added in 1913.\n\nThe churchyard is noted for having a large and long-established colony of glow worms (\"Lampyris noctiluca\"), which are becoming increasingly rare in the UK.\n\nThe current population of the village is 4,315, rising to 4,935 including the hamlets of Laverstoke and Steventon, with the village expanding following the developments at Foxdown, Overton Hill, Charters Hill and Seven Acres.\n\nThe village has local industry with the Portals Papermill and the recent Bombay Sapphire Development in nearby Laverstoke as well as light industrial units to the north and east of the village.\n\nThe village has a selection of shops and services and has four Public Houses; The White Hart, The Greyhound, The Red Lion and The Old House at Home.\n\nThe first village school was founded in 1817 as a free primary school situated in the workhouse. In 1834 a grant was made available to relocate the school to cottages on the River Test, though the building was never satisfactory and in 1858 a new school situated in the centre of the village at the crossroads was developed.\n\nIn 1968 a new school was built at the top of Court Drove to meet the needs of modern education and the school has been repeatedly upgraded in 1998, 2001 and 2014. The school has a landscaped playing field, children\u2019s play area and formal playgrounds. The school is in the latest inspection (July 2014) rated \"outstanding\" by Ofsted.\n\nThe village is served by Overton railway station on the West of England Main Line, which lies to the north of the village and by a weekday bus service provided by Stagecoach South to Whitchurch, Basingstoke and Andover.\n\nOverton has over 30 acres of sporting facilities that are managed by the Overton Recreation Centre including a 9-hole Golf Course, Cricket Pitches, Football Grounds, Tennis Courts as well as numerous covered venues. Overton also has an outdoor swimming pool at Lordsfield and has many societies ranging from Art to Zumba.\n\nOverton has two football teams, non-League football club Overton United F.C. who play at Bridge Street, and Tron FC play at Berrydown Sports Ground.\n\nOverton is the home of Overton Harriers & AC, a successful athletics club, based at the Bridge Street Pavilion. Overton Harriers compete in the Hampshire Road Race League and the Hampshire XC League and were the winners of the Men's Hampshire Road Race League in 2018.\n\nOverton Harriers host two races; the 'Overton 5' a road race which takes place in the village and surrounding countryside, and the Combe Gibbet race which is a 16-mile point to point race from Walbury Hill to Overton.\n\nOverton Cricket Club play at Bridge Street and Berrydown with three Saturday League teams, a Sunday Friendly team, a Mid-week Twenty20 League side and a youth set-up.\n\nOriginally established in 1962, the Overton Black Arrows archery club was founded to allow members to enjoy all aspects of the sport of archery, from beginner tuition, recreational archery through to competition coaching.\n\nOver the last 50 years, the club has established itself as a respected international archery club, with county, regional and national champions as members. Club members have coached and judged at all levels: Team GB members, British Team management, organisation of World Championships and World Games. Members currently shoot a variety of disciplines including Target, Field and Clout using Recurve, Compound and Long Bows.\n\nOverton holds a quadrennial Sheep Fair in commemoration of farmers leading sheep through the village for fairs recorded as early as 1246. The modern fair was first held in 2000 and most recently in July 2016.\n\nOverton has a group of Mummers, who perform frequently over the Yuletide period outside some of the public houses in the village.\n\nOverton is the location of the Children in Need fundraising event Carfest South which is hosted at Southley Farm during August Bank Holiday.\n\nIn Richard Adams' \"Watership Down\", the rival rabbit warren of Efrafa was located just north of the railway above Northington Farm in Overton.\n\nTwo peacocks, nicknamed \u2018Pierre\u2019 and \u2018Percy\u2019, live in the Dellands area at the top of the village. Thought to have come from a lavender farm in nearby Whitchurch and accused by some locals of disturbing the peace with their courtship vocals; a plan was initially hatched to evict them but this was overturned by the Parish Council which has agreed that they can stay.\n\n"

    "title": "Schwenker",
    "text": "Schwenker is a local term from the German state of Saarland, the Mosel Valley and big parts of Rheinland Pfalz and is used in three ways, all relating to the same grilled meat:\n\n\nGrilling is done over an open beech wood fire. Charcoal is sometimes used, but that is regarded as sub-standard because the beech smoke is considered to be an important part of the process. Gas-fueled grills are never used (except in commercial snack bars).\n\nBeside the Schwenker, sausages (German bratwurst and French merguez), different vegetables (such as bell peppers), Br\u00f6tchen (German bread rolls German cuisine), baguette (French type of bread) with garlic butter, potatoes and feta cheese (the latter three protected in aluminium foil) may be grilled.\n\nVarious side salads (usually a pasta (typically fusilli or spiralini) salad, a potato salad and a green salad), and baguette or Flutes are served with Schwenker. Many prefer specific beers, such as a pils by one of the local breweries, with their Schwenker.\n\nLegend has it that this style of cooking came to the region from South America. The region's Agate cutters had to travel further afield for their supplies as the local deposits became worked out in the early 19th Century and it is said that they enjoyed the Churrascaria they found in Brazil. The main similarity is that large chunks of meat are cooked over an open fire and served with vegetables.\n\nThe process of grilling the Schwenker is known as \"\u201cSchwenken\u201d\", which not only describes the grilling process itself but also the social event which surrounds the grilling activity. In Saarland one would not be invited to a \"barbecue\", but would instead be invited \u201cSchwenken\u201d.\n\nIn the nearby Hunsr\u00fcck district of Rhineland-Palatinate, the local speciality Spie\u00dfbraten is often served along with or instead of Schwenker. Raw meat, most usually pork neck or loin but sometimes also beef is marinated in a mixture of onions, salt and pepper for several hours. The meat is then roasted over an open beech log fire and served with potatoes and grated radish or seasoned cabbage. This is carried out in a similar manner to Schwenker, on a large grill resembling a wheel hanging down above the fire. The wheel is rotated slowly over the fire to ensure even cooking. \n\nSwinging grills and the aforementioned cuts are gaining popularity. If it's true that the Germans brought it from Brazil, it's also true that Americans brought it back to the U.S. \n\nIt is popular at beer festivals and other outdoor events and is also served in local restaurants, frequently accompanied with bratkartoffeln (sliced fried potatoes), onions and sweet cucumber.\n\nFor many years the town of Idar-Oberstein hosted an annual Spie\u00dfbraten Festival.\n"

    "title": "Solar balloon",
    "text": "A solar balloon is a balloon that gains buoyancy when the air inside is heated by solar radiation, usually with the help of black or dark balloon material. The heated air inside the solar balloon expands and has lower density than the surrounding air. As such, a solar balloon is similar to a hot air balloon. Usage of solar balloons is predominantly in the toy market, although it has been proposed that they be used in the investigation of planet Mars, and some solar balloons are large enough for human flight. A vent at the top can be opened to release hot air for descent and deflation.\n\nRaising the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding (ambient) air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by Archimedes' principle. The amount of lift (or buoyancy) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope.\n\nThe lift generated by 100,000\u00a0ft\u00b3 (2831.7\u00a0m\u00b3) of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\n\nThe density of air at 20\u00a0\u00b0C, 68\u00a0\u00b0F is about 1.2\u00a0kg/m\u00b3. The total lift for a balloon of 100,000\u00a0cu ft heated to (99\u00a0\u00b0C, 210\u00a0\u00b0F) would be 1595\u00a0lbf, 723.5\u00a0kgf. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\n\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (20\u00a0\u00b0C, 68\u00a0\u00b0F), a hot air balloon heated to (99\u00a0\u00b0C, 210\u00a0\u00b0F) requires about 3.91\u00a0m\u00b3 of envelope volume to lift 1\u00a0kilogram (62.5\u00a0cu ft/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the surrounding air. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for the envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000\u00a0meters (1% per 1,000\u00a0ft) of altitude gained.\n\nInsolation is a measure of solar radiation energy received on a given surface area in a given time. It is commonly expressed as average irradiance in watts per square meter (W/m2). Direct insolation is the solar irradiance measured at a given location on Earth with a surface element perpendicular to the Sun's rays, excluding diffuse insolation (the solar radiation that is scattered or reflected by atmospheric components in the sky). Direct insolation is equal to the solar constant minus the atmospheric losses due to absorption and scattering. While the solar constant varies with the Earth-Sun distance and solar cycles, the losses depend on the time of day (length of light's path through the atmosphere depending on the Solar elevation angle), cloud cover, moisture content, and other impurities.\n\nOver the course of a year the average solar radiation arriving at the top of the Earth's atmosphere is roughly 1,366 watts per square meter (see solar constant). The radiant power is distributed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, although most of the power is in the visible light portion of the spectrum. The Sun's rays are attenuated as they pass through the atmosphere, thus reducing the insolation at the Earth's surface to approximately 1,000 watts per square meter for a surface perpendicular to the Sun's rays at sea level on a clear day.\n\nA black body absorbs all the radiation that hits it. Real world objects are gray objects, with their absorption being equal to their emissivity. Black plastic might have an emissivity of around 0.95, meaning 95 percent of all radiation that hits it will be absorbed, and the remaining 5 percent reflected.\n\nIf the balloon is imagined as a sphere, the sunlight received by this sphere can be imagined as the cross-section of a cylinder with the same radius as this sphere, see diagram. The area of this circle can be calculated via:formula_1\n\nFor example, the energy received by a spherical, 5 metre radius, solar balloon with an envelope of black plastic on a clear day with direct insolation of 1000 W/m, can be estimated by first calculating the area of its great circle:\n\nThen multiplying this with the emissivity of the plastic and the direct insolation of the sun:\n\n78.54 * 0.95 * 1000 = 74,613 Watts\n\nAt sea level at 15\u00a0\u00b0C at ISA (International Standard Atmosphere), air has a density of approximately 1.22521\u00a0kg/m. The density of air decreases with higher temperatures, at the rate of around 20 grams per m per 5 K. Around 1 kilojoules of energy is needed to heat 1 kilogram of dry air by one kelvin (see heat capacity). So, to increase the temperature of 1 m of air (at sea level and at 15\u00a0\u00b0C) 5\u00a0\u00b0C requires around 5\u00a0\u00b0C * 1 kilojoules/(kilogram*kelvin) * 1.225 kilograms = 6.125 kilojoules. By doing so, you've reduced the mass of 1 m of air by around 24 grams. On a clear day with a black body surface of 1 m perpendicular to the sun and no heat loss, this would take a little over 6 seconds.\n\nBelow is the energy balance equation of the rate of energy lost of a solar balloon when drawing the boundary line around the balloon. The Solar Balloon experiences heat transfer due to convection and heat transfer due to radiation.\n\n\u0116out= t\u03c3\u03c0r(TS4-TF4) + h\u03c0r(TS-TF)\n\nTds=du+PdV\n\n\u0394s = \u222b(cv/T)dT + Rgasln(V2/V1)\n\n\u0394s = cvln(T2/T1)\n\nThe system is in equilibrium when the energy lost from the balloon through convection, radiation and conduction, equals the energy received through radiation from the sun.\n\nIn 1972, Dominic Michaelis, a British architect and the inventor of many solar utilities and projects, invented and built the first solar balloon, with a clear external surface and dark, heat-catching internal walls.\n\nThe first human carrying pure solar balloon flight was made on 1 May 1973 by Tracy Barnes in his balloon 'Barnes Solar Firefly Tetrahedron'. This balloon was made from a spiral tube of fabric that was formed into a tetrahedron. Dominic Michaelis is recorded as having owned the first pure solar balloon in Europe. This balloon was flown by Julian Nott across the English Channel. Records compiled for the FAI show that on 6 February 1978 Iranian Frederick Eshoo also made a solar flight in a balloon called Sunstat. This used a standard balloon design, but used clear plastic on one side, allowing the sun's radiation to reflect off the inner surface, heating the inside air.\n\nThe first 100% solar weather probe, named Ballon ORA, was launched from the French Antarctic Dumont d'Urville Station in January 2011 by a joint team of students, scientists and engineers. The idea was to assess the feasibility of using solar balloons as probes in remote area, where saving the use of lifting gas, helium or hydrogen, would be precious. The flight was a success, approaching . The savings do not only concern the lifting gas in itself. The ORA Balloon alleviates the need for the transportation, in and out, of the heavy gas canisters.\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has conducted a study on the use of solar balloons on several planets and moons in the solar system, concluding they are a viable option for Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nPlanning and airspace permission may be required by local or national airspace authorities.\n\nManned flights carry special risks. Unexpected clouds pose a serious risk, akin to regular hot air ballooning without reserve fuel. Solar balloons can descend rapidly when cooling occurs, making ballast very important.\n\n"

The word \"whiskey\" (as spelt in Ireland and America) or \"whisky\" (the typical spelling in Scotland and the rest of the world) itself is simply an anglicised version of this phrase, stemming from a mispronunciation of the word \"uisce\" in Ireland or \"uisge\" in Scotland. According to the Whiskey Museum in Dublin, Ireland, the different spelling began as a marketing decision (for increased pricing) - other companies followed the trend, the extra e was regardless a late addition as \u2018The Truths About Whisky\u2019 published in 1879 by the big four biggest Dublin distillers omits it. This development may in turn have influenced the Modern Irish word \"fuisce\" (\"whiskey\").

    "title": "Bank of America Tower (Manhattan)",
    "text": "The Bank of America Tower is a skyscraper in the Midtown area of Manhattan in New York City. It is located at One Bryant Park, on Sixth Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets diagonally opposite Bryant Park.\n\nThe project was designed by COOKFOX Architects. Work on the Bank of America Tower started in 2004 and it was completed in 2009. The Bank of America Tower was appraised in July 2019 at over $3.5 billion, ranking it among the most valuable office buildings in the city.\n\nThe Bank of America Tower is advertised to be one of the most efficient and ecologically friendly buildings in the world. It is the fifth tallest building in New York City, after One World Trade Center, 432 Park Avenue, 30 Hudson Yards, and the Empire State Building, and the seventh tallest building in the United States.\n\nThe building is 55 stories high and contains of office space. The tower's architectural spire is tall and was placed on December 15, 2007.\n\nThe tower includes three escalators and a total of 52 elevators: 50 to serve the offices and two leading to the New York City Subway's mezzanine below ground, for the 42nd Street\u2013Bryant Park/Fifth Avenue station. As part of the building's construction, a passageway was also built under the north side of 42nd Street connecting with the Times Square\u201342nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal station. The passageway has never been used, but as part of the reconstruction of 42nd Street Shuttle from 2019 to 2022, the passageway would be opened and a new entrance would be built on the north side of 42nd Street between Broadway and Sixth Avenue.\n\nSeveral buildings were demolished to make way for the tower. Among them was the Hotel Diplomat, a 13-story structure which had occupied the site at 108 West 43rd Street since 1911, and Henry Miller's Theatre, which was rebuilt and reopened at its previous location. The building's tenants include Bank of America as the anchor tenant and Marathon Asset Management, and the tower's platinum LEED rating and modern column-free office space has enticed tenants from all over the city. The Bank of America Tower is considered a worldwide model for green architecture in skyscrapers.\n\nThe building's Urban Garden Room at 43rd Street and Sixth Avenue is open to the public as part of the city's privately owned public space (POPS) program.\n\nThe design of the building makes it environmentally friendly, using technologies such as floor-to-ceiling insulated glazing to contain heat and maximize natural light, and an automatic daylight dimming system. The tower also features a greywater system, which captures rainwater for reuse. Bank of America states that the building is made largely of recycled and recyclable materials. Air entering the building is filtered, as is common, but the air exhausted is cleaned as well. Bank of America Tower is the first skyscraper designed to attain a Platinum LEED Certification.\n\nThe Bank of America Tower is constructed using a concrete manufactured with slag, a byproduct of blast furnaces. The mixture used in the tower concrete is 55% cement and 45% slag. The use of slag cement reduces damage to the environment by decreasing the amount of cement needed for the building, which in turn lowers the amount of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas produced through the normal cement manufacturing process. Each ton of regular cement produced creates about one ton of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nTemperature control and the production of some of its energy are accomplished in an environmentally friendly manner for the tower. Insulated glazing reduces thermal loss, lowering energy consumption and increasing transparency. Carbon dioxide sensors signal increased fresh air ventilation when elevated levels of carbon dioxide are detected in the building. Conditioned air for the occupants is provided by multiple air column units located in the tenant space that deliver 50\u00a0\u00b0F air into a raised access floor plenum. This underfloor air system provides users with the ability to control their own space temperature as well as improving the ventilation effectiveness. When building churn occurs, workstation moves can be performed more easily with lower cost and less product waste. The cooling system produces and stores ice during off-peak hours, and allows the ice to melt to help cool the building during peak load, similar to the ice batteries in the 1995 Hotel New Otani Tokyo in Japan. Ice batteries have been used since absorption chillers first made ice commercially available 150 years ago, before the invention of the electric light bulb.\n\nWater conservation features in the tower include waterless urinals, which are estimated to save of water per year and reduce CO emissions by per year (as calculated with the Pacific Institute water-to-air model). The tower has a 4.6-megawatt cogeneration plant, which provides part of the base-load energy requirements.\n\n\"Time\" magazine reported in August 2013 that the Bank of America Tower used twice as much energy overall as the Empire State Building, due to the large energy usage in the Bank of America Tower and the comparatively small occupancy rate of the Empire State Building.\n\nIn summer 2013, the Durst Organization employed Brooklyn Grange Rooftop Farm to install and maintain two honeybee hives on the building.\n\nWith the architectural spire included, the structural height of the Bank of America Tower is , making it the fifth tallest building in New York City (after One World Trade Center, 432 Park Avenue, 30 Hudson Yards, and the Empire State Building). A formal ruling by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat confirmed this.\n\nIn June 2008, the New York Academy of Sciences launched a podcast that highlights these green features.\n\nIn October 2009, the building was featured on episode 100 of the National Geographic Channel television series \"MegaStructures\".\n\nIn June 2010, the Bank of America Tower was the recipient of the 2010 Best Tall Building Americas award by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.\n\nMaterials fell from the building on three occasions:\n\n\n"

    "text": "The Faery Tale Adventure is a 1987 action role-playing video game designed by David Joiner and published by MicroIllusions for the Amiga, and later ported to the Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and Sega Genesis. The MS-DOS version is titled The Faery Tale Adventure: Book I. Microillusions also released a \"Book 1\" version for the Amiga which was going to be the start of a series of games, according to Talin, but bankruptcy prevented it. The initial version was produced for the Amiga 1000 and featured the largest game world to that date. A sequel, \"Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\", was released in 1997.\n\nThe gameplay resembles that of \"Ultima VII\" (1992). It featured the largest game world at the time, with over 17,000 computer screens.\n\nEach playable character has his strengths and weaknesses. Julian is a brave fighter, Phillip has luck and cleverness, and Kevin is gentle and kind. Each of these attributes affects vital game stats and the success of the quest:\n\nThe technique used to store such a huge world involved creating small-sized maps out of small blocks. Those small maps were reused and fit together seamlessly to form larger areas. Loading is asynchronous, and will happen when nearing the boundary of an area, without affecting the smooth scrolling, animation, and music.\n\nThe game is based around the quest of three brothers to retrieve the talisman stolen by the forces of evil and return it to their home village, Tambry, in the country of Holm. The player begins as Julian, the eldest of the three brothers; if unsuccessful with this character, the player thens take control of Philip, the next oldest, then finally the youngest of the three, Kevin. In addition to recovering the talisman, which is kept by an evil necromancer, the player must complete a number of other tasks which ultimately prove vital to the quest - save the king's daughter, gain the aid of a sea turtle, and kill an evil witch in her castle - and gather a number of artefacts which enable access to the strange dimension in which the necromancer resides.\n\nDavid Joiner designed \"The Faery Tale Adventure\" and was also responsible for the audio of \"Defender of the Crown II\" (1993), engineering for \"\" (2003), and contributions to \"The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection\".\n\nThis game was first released on the Amiga and then ported to other systems. Eventually it was released for the Commodore 64 and MS-DOS, although the graphics for these ports were of substantially lower quality due to hardware limitations. The Amiga version displays two screens as seen in the screenshot, one \"lowres\" 320 and one \"hires\" 640 pixels wide, allowing 64 + 16 colors.\n\nIn 1988, a port was developed for the Macintosh with 256 color graphics (more colors than the original Amiga version of the game). Unfortunately, the only color Macintosh model at the time was the Macintosh II, which was prohibitively expensive for a successful gaming platform. The Macintosh port was never released, but a working beta was completed before the development was cancelled. Eventually New World Computing acquired MicroIllusions and in 1991 ported the game to the Sega Genesis which was published by Electronic Arts. \n\nA review in \"Computer Gaming World\" described the game's user interface as natural and simple, while still being an impressive and playable game. The magazine stated that the Sega Genesis version \"subtly improved on the original\", such as a better teleportation system, while maintaining virtues such as excellent graphics. \"Dragon\" gave the computer game 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, and 4 out of 5 stars for the Genesis version. In 1996 \"Computer Gaming World\" ranked it as the 63rd best game of all time, calling it \"Real time adventure at its Amiga best.\"\n\nThe sequel, \"Halls of the Dead: Faery Tale Adventure II\", was developed by The Dreamers Guild and released by Encore, Inc. for MS-DOS and Windows in 1997. Its gameplay and graphics resemble \"\". An Amiga port was under development, but it was cancelled upon the bankruptcy of publisher Hollyware Entertainment. It continues the exploits of three brothers \u2013 strong Julian, agile Phillip, and wise Kevin, as they once again try to rid the world of evil.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"All in all, unless your desire for adventure outweighs your desire for a game with a sane interface, give this one a miss.\"\n\n\n"

Research balloons usually study a single aspect of science, such as air pollution, air temperature, or wind currents, although sometimes several experiments or equipment are flown together.\n\nOther than weather balloons, few research balloons are launched every year. This is driven by the large cost of the balloon, the instrument, which is usually custom made, and the cost of the launch. Because of the altitude reached by most research balloons, the air is too thin and too cold for humans to survive, therefore most research balloons are unmanned and operated remotely. There have been some balloons equipped with pressurized cabins, beginning with professor Auguste Piccard in the 1930s.\n\nResearch balloons are not only used on earth.

    "text": "Convective inhibition (CIN or CINH) is a numerical measure in meteorology that indicates the amount of energy that will prevent an air parcel from rising from the surface to the level of free convection.\n\nCIN is the amount of energy required to overcome the negatively buoyant energy the environment exerts on an air parcel. In most cases, when CIN exists, it covers a layer from the ground to the level of free convection (LFC). The negatively buoyant energy exerted on an air parcel is a result of the air parcel being cooler (denser) than the air which surrounds it, which causes the air parcel to accelerate downward. The layer of air dominated by CIN is warmer and more stable than the layers above or below it.\n\nThe situation in which convective inhibition is measured is when layers of warmer air are above a particular region of air. The effect of having warm air above a cooler air parcel is to prevent the cooler air parcel from rising into the atmosphere. This creates a stable region of air. Convective inhibition indicates the amount of energy that will be required to force the cooler packet of air to rise. This energy comes from fronts, heating, moistening, or mesoscale convergence boundaries such as outflow and sea breeze boundaries, or orographic lift.\n\nTypically, an area with a high convection inhibition number is considered stable and has very little likelihood of developing a thunderstorm. Conceptually, it is the opposite of CAPE.\n\nCIN hinders updrafts necessary to produce convective weather, such as thunderstorms. Although, when large amounts of CIN are reduced by heating and moistening during a convective storm, the storm will be more severe than in the case when no CIN was present.\n\nCIN is strengthened by low altitude dry air advection and surface air cooling. Surface cooling causes a small capping inversion to form aloft allowing the air to become stable. Incoming weather fronts and short waves influence the strengthening or weakening of CIN.\n\nCIN is calculated by measurements recorded electronically by a Rawinsonde (weather balloon) which carries devices which measure weather parameters, such as air temperature and pressure. A single value for CIN is calculated from one balloon ascent by use of the equation below. The z-bottom and z-top limits of integration in the equation represent the bottom and top altitudes (in meters) of a single CIN layer, formula_1 is the virtual temperature of the specific parcel and formula_2 is the virtual temperature of the environment. In many cases, the z-bottom value is the ground and the z-top value is the LFC. CIN is an energy per unit mass and the units of measurement are joules per kilogram (J/kg). CIN is expressed as a negative energy value. CIN values greater than 200 J/kg are sufficient to prevent convection in the atmosphere.\n\nformula_3\n\nThe CIN energy value is an important figure on a skew-T log-P diagram and is a helpful value in evaluating the severity of a convective event. On a skew-T log-P diagram, CIN is any area between the warmer environment virtual temperature profile and the cooler parcel virtual temperature profile.\n\nCIN is effectively negative buoyancy, expressed B-; the opposite of convective available potential energy (CAPE), which is expressed as B+ or simply B. As with CAPE, CIN is usually expressed in J/kg but may also be expressed as m/s, as the values are equivalent. In fact, CIN is sometimes referred to as negative buoyant energy (NBE).\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Reinaldo Carlos Merlo (born 20 May 1950) is an Argentine football coach and former player, who played as a midfielder.\n\nKnown as \"Mostaza\" (mustard) because of his off-blond hair, Merlo played his entire career for Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate as a defensive midfielder. He was part of the midfield that conquered a string of championships under coach \u00c1ngel Labruna between 1975 and 1981, the others being Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez and Norberto Alonso.\n\nMerlo was, together with goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol and defender Daniel Passarella, the backbone of that team. River, nonetheless, purchased several players to fill in Merlo's position, because he was considered a great defender, but a liability once the team got the ball. Among them were Ramiro P\u00e9rez, \"Chamaco\" Rodr\u00edguez, Della Savia, Cierra, Carranza, Pitarch, de los Santos, and Am\u00e9rico Gallego, who ultimately earned Merlo's position. Before retirement, Merlo mentored an up-and-coming midfielder: N\u00e9stor Gorosito. Both Gallego and Gorosito have since met Merlo as rival coaches.\n\nMerlo made over 500 appearances for River. He won seven titles during his time at the club and made 42 appearances in the Superclasico, more than any other player in history.\n\nAfter the end of his playing career, Merlo studied for an official coach matriculation, and proceeded to train several smaller teams until offered the position of coach at River Plate in 1989, together with Alonso. Merlo and Alonso were dismissed in mid-season after new club president Davicce made good on an election promise to bring Passarella as coach; the team won the championship title, and fans gave Merlo credit for a big part of that success.\n\nIn 1999, Merlo commanded Atl\u00e9tico Nacional of Colombia during the first half of the season; albeit successful, his managerial choices proved unpopular, and he resigned from his position. He was subsequently replaced by Luis Fernando Suarez, who would eventually win the tournament. Fans later gave credit to Merlo for his part on the title.\n\nIn 2001, Merlo did the almost-impossible and coached the team that ended a 35-year drought for Racing Club. His serenity and his insistence on taking things one match at a time earned him his nickname \"\"paso a paso\"\" (step by step), after the sentence he often told anxious fans and reporters.\n\nWhen Carlos Bilardo left Estudiantes de La Plata in 2004, Merlo was offered the post of coach; the team advanced from relegation danger to the top positions, being a contender both in the 2004 \"Apertura\" and the 2005 \"Clausura\". Merlo recalls fondly that both his debut (in 1969) and his first goal were both against Estudiantes .\n\nIn August 2005, Merlo resigned from his post in Estudiantes. A few weeks later, Leonardo Astrada resigned as River Plate coach, and Merlo was brought in his place.\n\nOn January 9, 2006, following a dim campaign in which River failed to contend for the 2005 \"Apertura\", Merlo resigned as River Plate coach, and Passarella was called to fill in. There is controversy about the way he left River Plate during that pre-season of 2006. It is said that Marcelo Gallardo told him that neither he nor his teammates agreed with \"his project\", and that led to many discussions that made Merlo quit the team, and Gallardo is still blamed for Mostaza's sudden departure.\n\nMerlo since went on to unsuccessful spells as managers at Racing Club de Avellaneda and Barcelona Sporting Club of Ecuador.\n\nIn 2009, he became the manager of Rosario Central but left the club on 15 April 2009 after only five games in charge (won 3, tied 1, and lost 1) because of personal problems with the player Ezequiel Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nMerlo returned to managerial functions on February 2013, hired by Club Douglas Haig, playing in Primera B Nacional.\n\n\n\n\n"

They are the military commands that the US military chain of command would use to launch a nuclear strike. Individual countries or specific regions may be included or withheld in the EAM, as specified in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP). The SIOP was updated annually until February 2003, when it was replaced by Operations Plan (OPLAN) 8044. Since July 2012, the US nuclear war plan has been OPLAN 8010-12, \"Strategic Deterrence and Force Employment\".\n\nEAMs use cryptographic protocols (including such methods as digital signatures) to authenticate the messages, thereby ensuring that they cannot be forged or altered.\n\nIn the United States, the EAM will be issued from the National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon or, if it has been destroyed by an enemy first strike, by the Alternate National Military Command Center - Site R at Raven Rock, Pennsylvania or by the Boeing E-4B National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC).\n\nThe messages are sent in digital format to nuclear-capable major commands. The messages are then relayed to aircraft that are on alert by the U.S. Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska, via single-sideband modulation radio transmitters of the High Frequency Global Communications System (formerly known as the Global High Frequency Service). The EAM is relayed to missile-firing nuclear submarines via special transmitters designed for communication with submarines. The transmitters include those designed to operate at Very Low Frequency (VLF). The submarines pick up the message via special antennas. Nuclear-capable forces will then be expected to carry out an EAM without fail. Manned bombers may be recalled, but missiles fired from land-based silos or from submarines cannot be recalled.\n\nSkyking messages are also read on the same network as EAMs, also known as \"Foxtrot Broadcasts\". These messages will interrupt an EAM if needed to be read. They contain a higher priority and time-sensitive code for orders that need immediate attention.\n\nThe EAM system was featured extensively and used as one of the primary plot devices in the feature film \"Crimson Tide\".\n\n"

    "text": "The Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu was an important New Kingdom period temple structure in the West Bank of Luxor in Egypt. Aside from its size and architectural and artistic importance, the temple is probably best known as the source of inscribed reliefs depicting the advent and defeat of the Sea Peoples during the reign of Ramesses III.\n\nThe first European to describe the temple in modern literature was Vivant Denon, who visited it in 1799-1801. Champollion described it in detail in 1829.\n\nInitial excavation of the temple took place sporadically between 1859 and 1899, under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities. During these decades the main temple was cleared, and a large number of the Greco-Roman period buildings, including a substantial Byzantine Church in the second court, were destroyed without notes or records being taken.\n\nThe further excavation, recording and conservation of the temple has been facilitated in chief part by the Architectural and Epigraphic Surveys of University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, almost continuously since 1924.\n\nThe temple, some long, is of orthodox design, and closely resembles the nearby mortuary temple of Ramesses II (the Ramesseum). The temple precinct measures approximately . by and contains more than of decorated wall reliefs. Its walls are relatively well preserved and it is surrounded by a massive mudbrick enclosure, which may have been fortified. The original entrance is through a fortified gate-house, known as a \"migdol\" (a common architectural feature of Asiatic fortresses of the time).\n\nJust inside the enclosure, to the south, are chapels of Amenirdis I, Shepenupet II and Nitiqret, all of whom had the title of Divine Adoratrice of Amun.\n\nThe first pylon leads into an open courtyard, lined with colossal statues of Ramesses III as Osiris on one side, and uncarved columns on the other. The second pylon leads into a peristyle hall, again featuring columns in the shape of Ramesses. The third pylon is reached by continuing up a ramp that leads through a columned portico and then opens into a large hypostyle hall (which has lost its roof). Reliefs and actual heads of foreign captives were also found placed within the temple, perhaps in an attempt to symbolise the king's control over Syria and Nubia.\n\nIn the Greco-Roman and Byzantine period, there was a church inside the temple structure, which has since been removed. Some of the carvings in the main wall of the temple have been altered by Christian carvings.\n\nThe royal palace was directly connected with the first courtyard of the temple via the \"Window of Appearances\".\n\nThe Medinet Habu king list is a procession celebrating the festival of Min, with the names of nine pharaohs. It can be found on the upper register of the eastern wall in the second courtyard.\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "A balloon satellite (also occasionally referred to as a \"satelloon\", which is a trademarked name owned by Gilmore Schjeldahl's G.T. Schjeldahl Company) is inflated with gas after it has been put into orbit.\n\nabbreviations:\n\n\nThe first flying body of this type was Echo 1, which was launched into a high orbit on August 12, 1960, by the United States. It originally had a spherical shape measuring , with a thin metal-coated plastic shell made of Mylar. It served for testing as a \"passive\" communication and geodetic satellite. Its international COSPAR number was 6000901 (9th satellite launched in 1960, 1st component).\n\nOne of the first radio contacts using the satellite was successful at a distance of nearly (between the east coast of the US and California). By the time Echo 1 burned up in 1968, the measurements of its orbit by several dozen earth stations had improved our knowledge of the precise shape of the planet by nearly a factor of ten.\n\nIts successor was the similarly built Echo 2 (1964 to about 1970). This satellite circled the Earth about lower, not at an angle of 47\u00b0 like that of Echo 1, but in a polar orbit with an average angle of 81\u00b0. This enabled radio contact and measurements to be made at higher latitudes. Taking part in the Echo orbit checks to analyze disturbances in its orbit and in the Earth's gravitational field were thirty to fifty professional earth stations, as well as around two hundred amateur astronomers across the planet in \"Moonwatch\" stations; these contributed around half of all sightings.\n\nThe Pythagorean theorem allows us to calculate easily how far a satellite is visible at such a great height. It can be determined that a satellite in a orbit rises and sets when the horizontal distance is . However, the atmosphere causes this figure to vary slightly. Thus if two radio stations are apart and the satellite's orbit goes between them, they may be able to receive each other's reflected radio signals if the signals are strong enough.\n\nOptical visibility is, however, lower than that of radio waves, because\n\nDespite this there is no problem observing a flying body such as Echo 1 for precise purposes of satellite geodesy, down to a 20\u00b0 elevation, which corresponds to a distance of . In theory this means that distances of up to between measuring points can be \"bridged\", and in practice this can be accomplished at up to .\n\nFor visual and photographic observation of bright satellites and balloons, and regarding their geodetic use, see Echo 1 and Pageos for further information.\n\nFor special testing purposes two or three satellites of the Explorer series were constructed as balloons (possibly Explorer 19 and 38).\n\nEcho 1 was an acknowledged success of radio engineering, but the passive principle of telecommunications (reflection of radio waves on the balloon's surface) was soon replaced by active systems. Telstar 1 (1962) and Early Bird (1965) were able to transmit several hundred audio channels simultaneously in addition to a television program exchanged between continents.\n\nSatellite geodesy with Echo 1 and 2 was able to fulfill all expectations not only for the planned 2\u20133 years, but for nearly 10 years. For this reason NASA soon planned the launch of the even larger balloon Pageos. The name is from \"passive geodesic satellite\", and sounds similar to \"Geos\", a successful active electronic satellite from 1965.\n\nPageos was specially launched for the \"global network of satellite geodesy\", which occupied about 20 full-time observing teams all over the world until 1973. All together they recorded 3000 usable photographic plates from 46 tracking stations with calibrated all-electronic BC-4 cameras (1:3 / focal length ). From these images they were able to calculate the stations' position three-dimensionally with a precision of about . The coordinator of this project was Professor Hellmut Schmid, from the ETH Zurich.\n\nThree stations of the global network were situated in Europe: Catania in Sicily, Hohenpei\u00dfenberg in Bavaria and Troms\u00f8 in northern Norway. For the completion of the navigational network exact distance measurements were needed; these were taken on four continents and across Europe with a precision of per kilometer.\n\nThe global network enabled the calculation of a \"geodetic date\" (the geocentric position of the measurement system) on different continents, within a few meters. By the early 1970s reliable values for nearly 100 coefficients of the Earth's gravity field could be calculated. \n\nBright balloon satellites are well visible and were measurable on fine-grained (less sensitive) photographic plates, even at the beginning of space travel, but there were problems with the exact chronometry of a satellite's track. In those days it could only be determined within a few milliseconds.\n\nSince satellites circle the earth at about , a time error of 0.002 second translates into a deviation of about . In order to meet a new goal of measuring the tracking stations precisely within a couple of years, a method of flashing light beacons was adopted around 1960.\n\nTo build a three-dimensional measuring network, geodesy needs exactly defined target points, more so than a precise time. This precision is easily reached by having two tracking stations record the same series of flashes from one satellite.\n\nFlash technology was already mature in 1965 when the small electronic satellite Geos (later named Geos 1) was launched; along with its companion Geos 2, it brought about a remarkable increase in precision.\n\nFrom about 1975 on, almost all optical measurement methods lost their importance, as they were overtaken by speedy progress in electronic distance measurement. Only newly developed methods of observation using CCD and the highly precise star positions of the astrometry satellite Hipparcos made further improvement possible in the measurement of distance.\n\n\n\n\"In German only:\"\n"

He recruited a band made up of Huw Chadbourn (keyboards), Robert Gregory (drums), John Pedder (bass) and Luke Scott (guitar), in order to tour and promote his work.\n\nDuring 1995, two further albums of demo recordings were released under the name Babybird (\"Bad Shave\" and \"Fatherhood\") and two in 1996 (\"The Happiest Man Alive\" and \"Dying Happy\"). Babybird were signed to Echo Records (a division of the Chrysalis Group), and the first authentic single, a full-band recording of \"Goodnight\", which had appeared in demo form on \"Fatherhood\", was released in July 1996, becoming a minor hit in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe group's second single, \"You're Gorgeous\", reached number 3 in the UK in October 1996, and was one of the biggest selling singles of the year, going on to chart around the world. However, it presented a more commercial face to the public in comparison to Jones's earlier work, as well as in comparison to the rest of the material on the \"Ugly Beautiful\" album. The album produced two more hit singles in \"Candy Girl\" and \"Cornershop\".\n\nIn 1997 the band returned to the studio, with producer Darren Allison, who had previously worked with Spiritualized and The Divine Comedy. They recorded two new tracks - a brand new version of \"Bad Shave\", and a re-working of \"CFC\". These new tracks were included on the 1997 U.S.A. release of \"Ugly Beautiful\".\n\nBabybird returned, minus keyboardist Huw Chadbourn, in 1998 with \"There's Something Going On\", preceded by a single, \"Bad Old Man\". The album was a modest success and was followed by further minor hits, \"If You'll Be Mine\" and \"Back Together\".\n\nIn 2000, a line-up of Babybird comprising Jones, Scott and Matt Hay created a third album. \"Bugged\". Sales were poor and the two singles from it, \"The F-Word\" (later the theme tune to Gordon Ramsay's UK TV cookery show of the same name) and \"Out of Sight\" barely dented the charts. Babybird were dropped by their record label soon after. A third single from the album, \"Fireflies\" / \"Getaway\" was released on Animal Noise records, but sold few copies. The band subsequently split.\n\nJones went on to write fiction, release solo work and score a film, \"Blessed\", in 2004. In October 2005, a posting on the Babybird website announced that the band had reformed as a three-piece featuring Jones, Scott and Robert Gregory. An album, \"Between My Ears There Is Nothing But Music\" was released on 25 September 2006.\n\nIn August 2009, it was announced that the band would be doing a tour of four gigs in November 2009 to promote the album \"Ex-Maniac\", which was released in February 2010. The line-up consisted of Jones, Scott and Gregory, with a cameo appearance from long-term fan Johnny Depp on the track \"Unloveable\". Depp also directed the video. The following year, Babybird released the album 'The Pleasures Of Self Destruction'.\n\nIn 2013, Stephen Jones announced via his Twitter feed that Babybird was no more. He launched his own site at Bandcamp, and released a number of albums under aliases such as \"Black Reindeer\", \"Deluder\", \"Arthritis Kid\", \"The Great Sadness\" and \"Trucker\".\n\nIn 2015, Jones started trading under the Babybird name again, reforming the band as a live unit in 2017 and in early 2019, toured as support to Dodgy with his new line-up. A number of Babybird tracks from 2015 onwards were released on 1 March 2019 as a compilation album 'Happy Stupid Nothing' Just a few months later, it was announced that another album 'Photosynthesis' would be released in July 2019. As well as these, Jones has been releasing a prolific amount of new Babybird albums via Bandcamp, often selling them as unique limited edition CDs.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "The MUSASINO-1 was one of the earliest electronic digital computers built in Japan. Construction started at the Electrical Communication Laboratories of NTT at Musashino, Tokyo in 1952 and was completed in July 1957. The computer was used until July 1962. Saburo Muroga, a University of Illinois visiting scholar and member of the ILLIAC I team, returned to Japan and oversaw the construction of MUSASINO-1.\n\nUsing 519 vacuum tubes and 5,400 parametrons, the MUSASINO-1 possessed a magnetic core memory, initially of 32 (later expanded to 256) words. A word was composed of 40 bits, and two instructions could be stored in a single word. Addition time was clocked at 1,350 microseconds, multiplication at 6,800 microseconds, and division time at 26.1 milliseconds.\n\nThe MUSASINO-1's instruction set was a superset of the ILLIAC I's instructions, so it could generally use the latter's software. However, many of the programs for the ILLIAC used some of the unused bits in the instructions to store data, and these would be interpreted as a different instructions by the MUSASINO-1 control circuitry.\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Stewart Farrar",
    "text": "Frank Stewart Farrar (28 June 1916 \u2013 7 February 2000), who always went by the name of Stewart Farrar, was an English screenwriter, novelist and prominent figure in the Neopagan religion of Wicca, which he devoted much of his later life to propagating with the aid of his seventh wife, Janet Farrar, and then his friend Gavin Bone as well. A devout communist in early life, he worked as a reporter for such newspapers as the \"Soviet Weekly\" and the \"Daily Worker\", and also served in the British army during the Second World War. He was responsible for writing episodes for such television series as \"Dr. Finlay's Casebook\", \"Armchair Theatre\" and \"Crossroads\", and for his work in writing radio scripts won a Writer's Guild Award. He also published a string of novels, written in such disparate genres as crime, romance and fantasy.\n\nAfter being initiated into Alexandrian Wicca by Maxine Sanders in 1970, he subsequently published one of the earliest books to describe this newly burgeoning religion, \"What Witches Do\" (1971). Within only a few months of being initiated, he had risen to the position of High Priest and founded his own coven in south London, with Janet Farrar, whom he would later handfast and then legally marry, as his High Priestess. In 1976 the couple moved to Ireland, where they went about founding new covens and initiating new people into Wicca - according to George Knowles, \"some seventy five percent of Wiccans both in the Republic and North of Ireland can trace their roots back to the Farrar's [sic]\". With Janet, he also set about writing books about the subject, most notably \"Eight Sabbats for Witches\" (1981) and \"The Witches' Way\" (1984).\n\nBecause of his work in propagating the Craft, the historian Ronald Hutton compared him to Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders as \"the third and last of the great male figures who have formed Wicca\".\n\nStewart Farrar was born at his family home of 239 Winchester Road, Highams Park, Essex during the First World War, and as such his father was away serving in the British army, stationed in Salonika in Greece. His family were middle class and well educated, and were also Christian Scientists, a denomination of Christianity that notably emphasised a belief in spiritual healing over conventional medicine, and which had been founded in 1886. The Farrar family had already been somewhat successful, with a number of them becoming somewhat culturally significant: the first words that had been broadcast by radio across the Atlantic, Guglielmo Marconi's \"can you hear me, Picken?\", for instance referred to Stewart's maternal uncle, whilst Stewart's first cousin was the notable poet James Farrar.\n\nHis father, after being demobbed from the army, took up employment at the London office of the Hong Kong and Shanghai bank, whilst his mother ran a private school in Wallington, Surrey, before later teaching at the Christian Science primary Claremont School in Esher, Surrey, where the Farrar family took up residence in a house on the school\u2019s grounds. His sister, Jean, was born in 1920, and he subsequently doted on her, but at the same time was known as a bully towards other children at primary school.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1935, Stewart attended the privately run City of London School, meaning that he had to commute daily into the city from his rural home. It was here that he joined the Officer Training Corps, where he learned much about military strategy, but at the same time disapproved of militarism and began to sympathise with left wing politics that were at odds with his conservative upbringing. At 17, he became a socialist, before later taking a further leftist stance by declaring himself a communist and rejecting Christianity, instead defining himself as an \"interested agnostic\". In 1935 he began attending University College London, where he studied journalism, and where he served both as president of the London University Journalism Union and editor of the \"London Union Magazine\". After he ended his university education in 1937, he spent three months as an exchange student in Dresden, Germany, where he became fluent in German and also developed an even greater hatred of right wing Nazism than he already held.\n\nReturning to Britain, Farrar immersed himself in propagating communism, joining the Communist Party of Great Britain, and working for the communist tabloid, the \"Daily Worker\". In 1939, he fell in love with and married Jean Clarke, a fellow communist.\n\nWhen war broke out against Nazi Germany in 1939, he immediately volunteered for the British army, feeling that he could put his military training to good use to fight against fascism. Instead of being sent abroad to fight, he was stationed in Britain, where he was set to work training new recruits in various combat techniques, and as such was stationed at a variety of different barracks. In 1940 he was stationed at Whitstable, though soon moved to Ashford, and the following year, his first son, Tony, was born. He was subsequently moved to Pembrokeshire in Wales, where he began having an affair with his secretary. Soon after this he divorced his wife, who likewise was also having an affair. Meanwhile, his war work largely involved working as an instructor in Anti-aircraft gunnery during World War II. He also wrote an instruction manual for a Bofors gun.\n\nIn 1945, he remarried, this time to a woman named Jean Mackinlay who was a lance-corporal in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. She would later provide him with his second child, Andy, just after Farrar himself was demobbed from the army in 1946, following the defeat of Germany. He was subsequently stationed in Berlin, where he worked as a civilian officer for the Allied Control Commission for Germany, and where, being separated from his second wife, he began to have an affair with his personal assistant, Hilke Carstens, a woman who would be described by Farrar's biographer Elizabeth Guerra as \"the love of his life and the woman who was to haunt his memories for years to come.\" Despite his love for Hilke, who would die of food poisoning only a few years later, Farrar returned to England, where with his wife and son, he moved to Bedford, where she would bear him a second child, a daughter named Lindsay, in 1948.\n\nSetting himself up as a journalist once more, Farrar briefly worked for the international news company Reuters, before becoming the English-language edition editor for the \"Soviet Weekly\", a newspaper published by the Soviet Embassy. It was through this appointment that he became a great friend to a prominent communist Petrovich Baikov, who was First Secretary of the Embassy. Meanwhile, he began to have an affair with Rachael 'Rae' Kaplin, a Jewish teacher who worked as a youth organiser for the Communist Party, and eventually decided to leave his wife and children to move in and live with her. The divorce from his wife would only come through in 1950, and he subsequently married Kaplin, making her his third wife; in 1951 she would bear him his fourth and final child, Judith.\n\nThe Communist Party later appointed him secretary of the British-Polish Friendship Society, and he would take a delegation of British trade unionists to visit Poland, visiting both the former Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz and some of the Polish coal mines. However, upon his return to Britain, he began to split from the communist Soviet Union and its policies, particularly after he was shocked at the way that they violently dealt with the Hungarian Uprising in 1957. Whilst remaining a leftist, he disassociated himself with the Communist Party of Great Britain and ceased working for the \"Daily Worker\".\n\nDisillusioned with the route that the communist powers were taking, and wanting nothing more to do with the Soviet Union and its allies in Britain, he took up a job working first for R.H. Radford, a public relations firm and then Associated British Path\u00e9 where he eventually rose to the position of documentary writer. Meanwhile, his continued infidelity led to him and Kaplin separating in 1953, although it would only be in 1963 that he finally gained a divorce from her. During this time, he had entered into a new relationship with a woman named Beth Donovan, and she encouraged him to continue seeing his children from previous relationships, whom in later life he always regretted neglecting; in 1958 however, they too split up. In 1959, he began yet another relationship, this time with a geography teacher named Barbara Williams, and they moved in together after only 11 days of first meeting. They would divorce in 1967, before remarrying in 1968, subsequently breaking up again the following year.\n\nIn 1958, Farrar published his first novel, \"The Snake on 99\", a whodunit crime story involving a Welsh detective known as Elwyn Morgan. In 1961 this was followed with \"Zero in the Gate\", another whodunit this time set around a newspaper company, drawing on his prior experiences. Two years later, his third novel, \"Death in the Wrong Bed\", came out, followed by a romance novel, \"Delphine, Be a Darling\", which was published under the female pseudonym of Laurie Stewart at the advice of his publisher.\nIn 1961, Farrar was sent by Path\u00e9 to Saudi Arabia, where the company was producing a documentary, and during this trip he visited the deserts of both Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Jordan. At the end of the following year, he was employed by ABC Television's Advanced Religious Training Course to train priests and clergymen in television techniques, a job he held for two years, and would later reminisce about getting drunk with two archbishops on one occasion. In 1963 he was then given the chance to write a script for a film, and the result, \"It's All Over Town\", was produced featured the actor Frankie Vaughan. Another of Farrar's most significant works was a documentary series that he scripted entitled \"Journey of a Lifetime\", in which he travelled to the Holy Land in the Middle East to research, and later experienced what he described as an almost spiritual experience while visiting the mediaeval city of Petra.\n\nIn 1964, he began writing freelance for various British television series, starting with an episode of \"Dr. Finlay's Casebook\", and in later years would write episodes for \"Armchair Theatre\" and the soap opera \"Crossroads\". Farrar would also co-write a 90-minute screenplay entitled \"Pity About the Abbey\" with his friend, Sir John Betjeman, who would later be made Poet Laureate. \"Pity About the Abbey\" was a story in which Westminster Abbey was destroyed to make way for a by-pass, and satirised what Farrar saw as the current trend to demolish significant or beautiful structures. It was filmed and broadcast by the BBC in July 1965.\n\nIn 1967, Stewart's wife fell in love with one of his best friends, Norman, and so he granted her a divorce, but remained both her and Norman's friend, carrying no resentment towards them. Feeling alone, he turned to his second wife, Jean Mackinlay, who herself had just recently divorced her second husband, and although she refused his offer of reigniting their relationship, they did once more become friends. In 1968 he would re-united with another former lover, Beth Donovan, and married her, but he would leave her in June 1969 when he met a new woman, Isabel Sutherland, and subsequently moved in with her and her daughter. Meanwhile, in 1968 he won a Writer\u2019s Guild Award for his six-part radio serial \"Watch the Wall my Darling\", which was based upon the poem \"A Smuggler's Song\" by one of his favourite poets, Rudyard Kipling. Following this, in February of the following year, he once more returned to journalism, taking up employment with the popular weekly magazine \"Reveille\".\n\nFarrar was sent by \"Reveille\" to a press screening of the film \"Legend of the Witches\". The screening was also attended by Alex Sanders and Maxine Sanders, the founders of Alexandrian Wicca, who had served as advisors during the film's creation. According to his biography at mystica.com, Farrar was \"skeptical about Witchcraft but was interested in Sanders upon meeting him\". The paper requested that Farrar interview Sanders and published the interview as a two-part story. Sanders, \"impressed\" with the interview, invited Farrar to attend an Alexandrian Wiccan initiation ritual, and prompted Farrar to write an entire book on Wicca. According to mystica.com, Farrar \"found the ceremony both dignified and moving\". Farrar began work on his first non-fiction book, \"What Witches Do\", and began taking classes on witchcraft from the Sanders'. Maxine Sanders remembers Farrar as \"a charming man, a sincere student with an active flexible mind\". Maxine Sanders also notes that it was in response to Farrar's questions about how to describe their practice in his book that the Alexandrian tradition was named.\n\nOn 21 February 1970 Farrar was initiated into Alexandrian Wicca and joined the Sanders' coven. Farrar met his future wife, then Janet Owen (34 years his junior), in the coven. Janet Farrar asserts that the couple were both elevated to the second degree \"in an unoccupied house in Sydenham\" by the Sanders on 17 October 1970, and that they received the third, and final, degree of initiation in their flat 24 April 1971. Two of Janet and Stewart's coven - \"Don and Barbara\" were present, as were the Sanders coven. Janet Farrar remembers the initiation well, as Maxine invoked Sekhmet to banish one of her coven members. She broke her flail during this banishing. Recently their 3rd Degree initiation has been disputed by some Alexandrian \"revisionists\", unaware that Stewart Farrar kept an archive of all his correspondences with the Sanders and possessed copies of both his own and the Sanders' coven records that unequivocally prove that the initiation took place. \"What Witches Do\" was published in 1971. The book has been called \"controversial\" because of Farrar's assertion that Sanders should be \"ranked above Gerald B. Gardner and alongside of Aleister Crowley and Eliphas Levi in terms of magical achievement\". Farrar later backed away from the assessment, although he did later state that he believed that Sanders \"was both a charlatan and a genuine magician\". The relationship between Alex Sanders and Stewart Farrar became one of mutual respect after letters began to be exchanged between them in 1977. To quote Sanders (8 March 1997):\nYour letters give off good vibrations of work and happiness. I feel that all our growing pains concerning publicity and personalities of the Wicca, are beginning to bear fruit. A few of us in the midst of many are beginning to establish the foundation (I mean the building itself) on the raw materials, to get the foundation stone in place.\n\nThey remained in dialogue until Alex Sanders' death in the late 1980s.\n\nFarrar and Owen had begun running their own coven in 1971, before their third degree initiation ceremony, and were handfasted in 1972 and legally married in 1975. The ceremony was attended by Farrar's two daughters and two sons from three previous marriages - his marriage to Owen was his sixth. The late 1970s saw the publication of several more novels by Farrar, all of which were occult-themed fantasy novels or science fiction. Farrar left \"Reveille\" to pursue a full-time freelance writing career in 1974. In 1976 the Farrars moved to Ireland to get away from the busy life of London. They lived in County Mayo and County Wexford, finally settling in \"Herne Cottage\" in Kells, County Meath. Both husband and wife went on to publish a number of \"classic\" and \"influential\" books on the Wiccan religion and on coven practises. Their 1981 \"Eight Sabbats for Witches\" included material the authors claimed to be from the Alexandrian tradition's Book of Shadows. The Farrars, with the support of Doreen Valiente, argued in the book that even though the publishing of this material broke their oath of secrecy, it was justified by the need to correct misinformation. Janet Farrar indicates that some of the rituals contained in the couple's books were actually written by them, this includes the Oak King/Holly King cycle which they researched from Robert Grave's \"White Goddess\". This was the first use of this cycle in any Wiccan Book of Shadows, and has been adopted into many traditions since. Although they never officially left the Alexandrian tradition, after the book's research was complete they stopped using the term to describe themselves. The couple co-authored four more books on Wicca.\n\nThey were joined by Gavin Bone, with whom they entered into a \"polyfidelitous relationship\". The three of them would co-author two more books; \"The Healing Craft\" and \"The Pagan Path\" (an investigation into the many varieties of Neopaganism). In 1999 the Farrars received the Aquarian Tabernacle Church charter for Ireland, and were ordained as third level clergy.\n\nFarrar died on 7 February 2000 after a brief illness.\n\nA biography on Stewart Farrar entitled \"Writer on a Broomstick\" by Elizabeth Guerra was published in February 2008 by R. J. Stewart books.\n\nThe following books, written by Farrar as the sole author are works of fiction, with the exception of \"What Witches Do\".\n\nThe following are non-fiction books.\n\n\n"

    "title": "The Trouble with Trillions",
    "text": "\"The Trouble with Trillions\" is the twentieth episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series \"The Simpsons\". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 5, 1998. It was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Swinton O. Scott III. The episode sees Homer being sent by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to obtain a trillion dollar bill that Mr. Burns failed to deliver to Europe during the post-war era.\n\nAs all of Springfield rushes to send out their tax returns just before midnight on April 15, Homer realizes he did not file his. He rushes and provides false information before delivering it to the post office. The IRS discovers Homer's fraud and arrests him. To avoid prison, Homer agrees to help Agent Johnson of the FBI. With a hidden microphone under his shirt, Homer uncovers that his coworker Charlie is leading a group planning to assault all government officials, and has him arrested by the FBI for conspiracy.\n\nImpressed, Johnson reveals to Homer that in 1945, President Harry S. Truman printed a one trillion-dollar bill to help reconstruct post-war Europe and enlisted Montgomery Burns to transport the bill. However, it never arrived and the FBI suspects Burns still has it with him. Homer is sent in to investigate. At the Burns estate, Homer searches for the bill before Burns, who believes Homer is a reporter from \"Collier's\" magazine, reveals that he keeps it in his wallet. Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns, who, insisting he's innocent, protests that the government oppresses the average American. Moved by Burns' speech, Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns.\n\nThe two men go to Smithers, who suggests they leave the country. Burns takes Smithers and Homer in his old plane, setting off to find an island and start a new country. The three land in Cuba and appear before Fidel Castro. Burns tries to buy the island, but Castro foils his plan when asks to see the trillion-dollar bill and then refuses to give it back. Later, Burns, Smithers, and Homer are on a makeshift raft. Smithers asks whether Burns will be facing jail time; Burns replies that, if it is a crime to love one's country or steal a trillion dollars or bribe a jury, he is guilty.\n\nThe episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the original draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer was to learn that he was a Native American, and would try to exploit it to not have to pay taxes. The idea had been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.\n\nThe scene where the FBI agent sits near Homer is a reference to the film \"JFK\". While Homer, Mr. Burns, and Smithers are in Cuba, a billboard can be seen with a picture of Che Guevara being used to advertise Duff Beer.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"The Trouble with Trillions\" finished 51st in ratings for the week of March 30\u2013April 5, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 7.5, equivalent to approximately 7.4 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"World's Wildest Police Videos\" and \"Melrose Place\".\n\nSince airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. The authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, did not enjoy the episode, calling it, \"Rather dull and unfunny\", adding, \"A mediocre episode at best that makes Burns out to be altruistic (which he's not) and very stupid in letting Castro have his money (which he so wouldn't).\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" characterized the episode as one of \"The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes\". The article noted the episode contained \"one of the few gags in comedy history about relying too heavily on surveillance photography in spying\".\n\nIan Jones and Steve Williams for \"Off the Telly\" criticized all of season 9 for lacking an episode that centered on Burns, as they consider Burns to be the crux of many good episodes, though they noted that \"The Trouble with Trillions\" came the closest, with Burns having a supporting role. In a review of \"The Simpsons\" ninth season, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the \"Herald Sun\" described the episode as \"brilliant\", and highlighted it along with episodes \"Bart Carny\" and \"The Joy of Sect\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the episode was screened on BBC Two in January 1999, before any other episode from season six or later were seen by viewers on the channel, as part of a night of Cuba-themed programming. The episode had made its UK premiere in June 1998, by the program's primary rights holder in the country, Sky One.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Fish ball",
    "text": "Fish balls are a dish in China, notably popular in southern China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, as well as in parts of Southeast Asia among the overseas Chinese communities. They are made with fish paste and boiled in a soupy broth, or deep fried. They are also common in Nordic countries.\n\nThere are two variants of fish balls, each differing in their textures, production method and primary regions they are produced in:\n\nIn the Fuzhou area, \"Fuzhou fish balls\" () are made from fish with a minced pork filling. The variation from Fuqing is much larger.\n\nThere are three kinds of fishballs, known as (literally \"fish eggs\"), sold in Hong Kong and Macau. They are yellow, white and golden.\n\nFishballs are a popular street food in Hong Kong and the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest, which escalated from the government's crackdown on unlicensed street hawkers during the Chinese New Year holidays have been referred to by some media outlets and social media platforms as the \"Fishball Revolution\" ().\n\nSmaller in size, made from cheaper fish than the white variety, they are usually sold at food stalls with five to seven balls on a bamboo skewer. The fish balls are usually boiled in a spicy curry sauce. Virtually every street stall creates its own recipe of curry satay sauce to differentiate them from other sellers. Fish balls are one of the city's most popular and representative \"street foods\" ().\n\nWhite fish balls are larger in size and made with white fish such as Spanish mackerel, pounded many times until the fish is a fine paste. Salt can be added, or egg whites and corn starch, but generally no other ingredients are added. The balls are then cooked by boiling. As a result of this cooking method, these fish balls are white in color. White fish balls should have an elastic (bouncy) and fluffy texture and a strong taste of fish. They are made using a more costly fish, and has a considerably different texture and taste. This kind is usually served to complement noodles at Ch\u00e1ozh\u014du-style noodle restaurants, and at some \"cha chaan tengs\", which also sell beef balls () and cuttlefish balls (). Readily available in traditional markets and supermarkets, fish balls are also a popular ingredient for hot pot.\n\nWhite fish balls from traditional fish ball restaurants are made from fresh fish and are normally hand-made () by the owners using traditional techniques.\n\nThe big golden fish ball is a snack in Cheung Chau. Distinguishing features include size, sauce and texture. They can be fist-sized and are served with a special curry sauce, and are mainly made from fresh fish which makes the texture more smooth.\n\nThe basic ingredients are fish, flour and flavourings such as salt and sugar, can also be used. The proportions depend on the quality and type to be made. The white fish balls found in some traditional Hong Kong restaurants are made using fresh fish; while street style are made using cheap fish and a mixture of flour to reduce costs. Flathead mullet () and Daggertooth pike conger () are common choices.\n\nOriginally, to reduce costs, they were likely made by mixing and frying the remaining materials of Chaozhou fish ball () or stale fish. More recently, they began to be imported and nowadays, they are mainly imported by wholesalers and the texture is more consistent.\n\nMilkfish balls () are frequently found in Taiwan. The natural texture and aroma of the milkfish give this variant a unique taste. This is one of the main ways milkfishes' lesser-prized yet highly abundant white meat is consumed.\n\nIn Indonesia, fish balls are called \"bakso ikan\" (fish \"bakso\"). The most popular bakso are made of beef, but fish bakso is also available, served with tofu, vegetables and fish \"otak-otak\" in clear broth soup as \"tahu kok\". Bakso ikan has softer texture and lighter color compared to beef balls. Bakso ikan might be thinly sliced as additional ingredients in \"mie goreng\", \"kwetiau goreng\", \"nasi goreng\" and \"cap cai\". A similar dish made of fish surimi is called \"pempek\", however most of \"pempek\" are deep fried instead of boiled.\n\nFish balls, known as \u9c7c\u5706 (y\u00fa yu\u00e1n) or \u9b5a\u4e38 (y\u00fa w\u00e1n), are cooked in many ways in Malaysia and Singapore. They can be served with soup and noodles like the Chiuchow style or with \"yong tau foo\" (). They can also be served with noodles called \"mee pok\". In some cases it is also fried, and served on a stick.\n\nFish balls are a popular street food in the Philippines, and considered a cultural delicacy. The most common type of Filipino fish balls are known as \"bola-bola\" (literally, \"ball-ball\"). They are somewhat flat in shape, most often made from cuttlefish or pollock, and served with a sweet and spicy sauce or with a thick, black, sweet and sour sauce.\n\nFish balls in the Philippines are sold by street vendors pushing wooden deep-frying carts. The balls are served skewered, offered with three kinds of dipping sauces: spicy (white/orange coloured) \u2013 vinegar, water, diced onions and garlic; sweet (brown gravy coloured) \u2013 corn starch, banana ketchup, sugar and salt; and sweet/sour (amber or deeper orange coloured) \u2013 the sweet variety with lots of small hot chilis added. Dark sauces are rare, as these are soy sauce-based and soy sauce is expensive for street food.\n\nA recent trend in the industry is the introduction of varieties: chicken, squid (cuttlefish actually), and elongated versions of fishballs inaccurately called \"\"kikiam\"\" or \"\"tempura\"\". The latter, however, are completely different dishes from true \"kikiam\" (a Filipino version of Hokkien \"ngo hiang\") or the Japanese \"tempura\".\n\nFish balls are very popular in Thai cuisine. They are usually fried or grilled as a snack. In Chinese-influenced restaurants, fish balls are cooked in noodle soups and come in many varieties. They can also be eaten in a Thai curry. \"Kaeng khiao wan luk chin pla\" is green curry with fish balls. One of the main fishes used in the production of fish balls in Thailand is \"Pla krai (Chitala ornata)\".\n\nKnown as \"Fiskbullar\" in Sweden and \"fiskeboller\" in Norway, they usually come in metal cans or transparent plastic containers containing stock or brine.\n\nIn the Faroe Islands, fish balls are called \"knettir\" and are made with ground fish and mutton fat.\n\nIn Norway, fish balls are a staple food commonly served with potatoes, carrots and/or cauliflower or broccoli in a white sauce.\nSauce is often made with the stock from the container, sometimes with \"karri\" (curry) as condiment, or mixed to create curry-sauce. \nAdditionally there is a pudding made with minced, ground fish and milk (\"fiskepudding\") or more luxuriously, with cream (\"fl\u00f8tepudding\"), served with potatoes, carrots, steamed peas, and cauliflower, and sometimes shrimp.\nTiny fish balls called \"suppeboller\" (literally \"soup balls\") are also common in fish soup.\n\nIn Sweden, they are normally served with mashed potatoes or rice, boiled green peas and dill, caviar or seafood sauces.\n\nFish balls with roe () contain egg filling that are served at hot pot restaurants. It has sweet and salty taste with a popping element from the roe's texture. There is also a fried golden version.\n\n[[Category:Fish dishes]]\n[[Category:Fujian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong cuisine]]\n[[Category:Indonesian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Malaysian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Meatballs]]\n[[Category:Norwegian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Philippine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Singaporean cuisine]]\n[[Category:Street food]]\n[[Category:Surimi]]\n[[Category:Swedish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Thai cuisine]]\n[[Category:Teochew cuisine]]"

He tolerates to some extent the unauthorised distribution of his works on the internet.\n\nIn 1996 he was awarded the Prize of the Czech Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror for promising new authors.\n\nThe heroes of Kulh\u00e1nek's books possess extraordinary or even supernatural abilities (vampires, cyborgs etc.); an often used plot element is that the protagonist is assaulted at the beginning of the story, then takes refuge from the more numerous, albeit 'normal', enemies. In the end he then faces hidden leaders, even more powerful than the hero himself.\n\nKulh\u00e1nek's narrative style is swift with lots of black humour and naturalistic descriptions of violence and is sometimes compared to the style of Quentin Tarantino. The language used in his works is, however, rather simple and the plot sometimes has logical flaws.(*May be biased)\n\nThe story is set in a post-apocalyptic world, the cataclysm in question being the onset of a new ice age. The opening part of the book takes place in a virtual reality of sorts, a world even worse than what is left of the physical reality. Here we get introduced to the main character, who has no memories of his former life, yet someone helps him to return to the real world. There his mind is placed into a \"super-body\". The hero is solitary, and if he does make attachments to other people, then they die soon. The main story arc is filled with blood, ice, bullets, gore and black humour, which forms the main premise of the book.\nYet the question still remains: What is true, and what is false?\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "The Chremonidean War (267\u2013261 BC) was fought by a coalition of some Greek city-states and Ptolemaic Egypt against Antigonid Macedonian domination. The end result of this conflict was a Macedonian victory which confirmed Antigonid control over the city-states of Greece.\n\nThe origins of the war lie in the continuing desire of many Greek city-states, most notably Athens and Sparta, for a restoration of their former independence along with the Ptolemaic desire to stir up discontent within the sphere of influence of its Macedonian rival. Ptolemy Philadelphus's ambitions in the Aegean were threatened by Antigonus Gonatas's fleet, so he carefully built up an anti-Macedonian coalition amongst the Greek city-states. He especially concentrated on courting Athens, by supplying the city with grain.\n\nThe anti-Macedonian faction in Athens, led by the stoic Chremonides, took power and proceeded to declare war on Macedon (possibly as early as the autumn of 268 BC). The first year of the conflict saw only minor confrontations, though they generally ended favourably for the anti-Macedonian coalition. After the indecisive campaign season of 266 BC, in which Athens was assisted by a Ptolemaic fleet under Patroclus, the war began to turn against the Greek city-states, and in 265 BC Antigonus won a decisive and crushing victory outside Corinth during which the Spartan King Areus I was killed.\n\nWith their primary ally defeated and too militarily weak to confront the Antigonids alone, the Athenians could do little but wait behind their walls and hope the Ptolemies could send aid before the inevitable siege. Unfortunately for them, however, Philadelphus would not be ready to mount a major expedition until after Athens had already been starved into surrender in either 262 BC or 261 BC. In the end it did not matter since when the Ptolemies finally tried to send aid and reinforcements to Athens, their fleet was defeated off Cos (probably in 261 BC). This action, called the Battle of Cos, also features in the narrative of the second of the Syrian Wars with a strong alternative date of 258 or 255 BC.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Athens lost her last pre-Hellenistic vestiges of political independence.\n"

After the War he served as Air Attach\u00e9 in Paris until he retired in 1952.\n\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1944 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1948, promoted to substantive air vice marshal in 1950 and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1952.\n\nSir Robert was appointed Governor of South Australia in August 1952. He and Lady George arrived in Adelaide early the following year. The Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, noted in his welcome address to Sir Robert that governors were expected to be \"an inspiration in times of danger.\"\n\nPlayford's words turned out to be portentous \u2013 South Australia would suffer through earthquake, fire and flood in consecutive years during Sir Robert's tenure. In March 1954, the worst earthquake in Adelaide's history damaged Government House, along with many other buildings in the city. Less than a year later, the Governor's summer residence at Marble Hill was destroyed in the Black Sunday bushfires of January 1955. He and his wife and staff sheltered under wet blankets in the driveway, and were lucky to escape with their lives. In a particularly cruel twist of fate, all Sir Robert and Lady George's possessions were lost in the fire, having been relocated to Marble Hill while Government House was undergoing repairs for the damage suffered in the earthquake. Finally, the 1956 Murray River flood was the largest in recorded history. On 20 August, Sir Robert surveyed the flood-hit areas in a light aircraft, and said he was \"appalled at the tremendous area underwater and the terrific damage which had resulted.\"\n\nSir Robert was a colourful governor, once demanding a personal helicopter from Premier Playford. Although admired for his bravery, Sir Robert was considered old-fashioned by the masses, particularly due to his impatience, polo-playing, and his habit of carrying a fly-whisk and a cane. Lady George was an ardent supporter of many charities, but her support for traditional family roles was not popular with the emerging feminists; once, while officiating at the opening of new laboratories at a girls' college, she claimed: \"The most important thing for a girl is to learn how to run a home well.\"\n\nDespite their frequent clashes, Playford supported George and the dignity of the Vice-Regal post in a 1956 court case regarding the cook's wages. The prosecuting lawyer was future Labor premier Don Dunstan. Playford negotiated an out-of-court settlement on condition that Dunstan and his Labor colleagues in the House would not debate the budget item. Labor maverick Samuel Lawn (the member for Adelaide) did not honour the agreement, and tried to raise a public scandal. Playford responded by extending George's term.\n\nGeorge was appointed Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of South Australia in 1956.\n\nGeorge and his family retired to England in 1959 after which he held no further government appointments. He died in a London Hospital on 13 September 1967, after being accidentally hit by a car and not regaining consciousness.\n"

That's why it's called Lepakshi. Lepakshi is culturally and archaeologically significant as it is the location of shrines dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and Veerabhadra which were built during the Vijayanagara Kings' period (1336\u20131646). The temples are the location of mural paintings of the Vijayanagara kings and Kannada inscriptions. Near the temple complex is a large granite Nandi bull. On a hillock known as \"Kurma Saila\", \"tortoise shaped hill\", are other temples to Papanatheswara, Raghunatha, Srirama, and Durga. Lepakshi is also famous for puppet show based on Hindu mythology.There is also a three-headed bull with single body carved on the pillar of main entrance pillar.\n\nThe Veerabhadra temple of Lepakshi, which was built by the brothers Viranna and Virupanna, is dedicated to Veerabhadra. It is an example of the Vijayanagara architectural style. Points of interest in the temple include a rock chain, Vastu Purusha, the Padmini race lady, the hanging pillar, Durga Paadam, the eyes of Viroopaakshanna and Lepakshi saree designs. The paintings on the roof are made with natural pigments.

It was founded in Bombay in 1853 as the Mercantile Bank of Bombay; and later in 1857 was renamed to Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China with London as its headquarters.\n\nBy 1959, through a series of mergers and divisions, its name had been shortened to 'Mercantile Bank, Ltd', and was acquired by HSBC the same year. The bank was an issuer of Hong Kong bank notes until 1974.\n\nThe historic bank started life in October 1853 as the 'Mercantile Bank of Bombay', taking the name of the city, Bombay (now Mumbai), where it was founded. It expanded its operations to the Far East in November 1854 with the opening of an office in Shanghai. In 1857, the bank was granted a royal charter, and it established a presence in Hong Kong. The name was late changed to the 'Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China', and it moved its headquarters to London in 1858.\n\nIt competed with the other great British banks of those times, namely - Oriental Bank Corporation, the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank and Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; involved in trade between India and China and other British possessions, East of suez. By 1860, its total assets reached the amount of US$21.7 million, a medium-sized bank by the standards of that time - a comparison shows that one of the leading Anglo-Indian banks, the Oriental Bank Corporation was about three times larger in terms of total assets. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869; and completion of Indo-European telegraph line\n\nThe bank expanded its presence with branches across India, the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States, in Hong Kong and in Shanghai. It issued banknotes in Penang, Singapore and Hong Kong. It became the issuer of Hong Kong banknotes for the first time from 1859 to 1892.\n\nTrouble in 1893 meant it lost its charter, and was reconstituted as the 'Mercantile Bank of India, Ltd'.\n\nThere was a re-consolidation of its operations at the beginning of the 20th century; and in 1912 it again became issuer of Hong Kong banknotes, a privilege it continued until 1974.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Mercantile Bank had to close down several offices in the Far East, but it managed to re-open its offices after the war. The Hong Kong office re-opened in February 1946 and the Shanghai office in 1945, but was closed down its Shanghai operations in 1952 due to the Communist party rule. In 1952, total assets of the bank totalled US$205.5 million.\n\nThe bank was acquired in 1959 by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. By then its name had been shortened again, to 'Mercantile Bank, Ltd'. The acquired office in Bombay now houses the HSBC Group's Head Office in India.\n\nThe Mercantile Bank continued to issue Hong Kong banknotes until the early 1970s. The signing of the historic Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, provided HSBC added impetus to expand overseas and sold the entity - Mercantile Bank, Ltd to Citibank the same year as part of its consolidation strategy. It was eventually sold to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. in 1987.\n\nNot to be confused with Bombay Mercantile Bank which a is Co-operative bank.\n\n\n"

    "text": "Beatrice Whitney Straight (August 2, 1914 \u2013 April 7, 2001) was an American theatre, film and television actress and a member of the prominent Whitney family. She was an Academy Award and Tony Award winner as well as an Emmy Award nominee.\n\nStraight made her Broadway debut in \"The Possessed\" (1939). Her other Broadway roles included Viola in \"Twelfth Night\" (1941), Catherine Sloper in \"The Heiress\" (1947) and Lady Macduff in \"Macbeth\" (1948). For her role as Elizabeth Proctor in the production of \"The Crucible\" (1953), she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. For the satirical film \"Network\" (1976), she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance is the shortest ever to win an Academy Award for acting, at five minutes and two seconds of screen time. She also received an Emmy Award nomination for the miniseries \"The Dain Curse\" (1978). Straight also appeared as Mother Christophe in \"The Nun's Story\" (1959) and Dr. Martha Lesh in \"Poltergeist\" (1982).\n\nBeatrice Whitney Straight was born in Old Westbury, New York, the daughter of Dorothy Payne Whitney of the Whitney family, and Willard Dickerman Straight, an investment banker, diplomat, and career U.S. Army officer. Her maternal grandfather was political leader and financier William Collins Whitney. In 1918, when Straight was four years old, her father died in France of influenza during the great epidemic while serving with the United States Army during World War I. Following her mother's remarriage to British agronomist Leonard K. Elmhirst in 1925, the family moved to Devon, England. It was there that Straight was educated at Dartington Hall and began acting in amateur theater productions. In the 1930s, she attended the Cornish School in Seattle where many of her teachers at Dartington Hall were from and to which both she and her mother became major benefactors.\n\nStraight returned to the United States and made her Broadway debut in the play \"The Possessed\" (1939). Most of her theater work was in the classics, including \"Twelfth Night\" (1941), \"Macbeth\" (1948) and \"The Crucible\" (1953), for which she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play.\n\nFrom its inception, Straight was a member of the Actors Studio, attending the class conducted three times weekly by founding member Robert Lewis; her classmates included Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Jerome Robbins, Sidney Lumet, and about 20 others.\n\nStraight was active in the early days of television, appearing in anthology series such as \"Armstrong Circle Theatre\", \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\", \"Kraft Television Theatre\", \"Studio One\", \"Suspense\", \"The United States Steel Hour\", \"Playhouse 90\" and \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", and dramatic series like \"Dr. Kildare\", \"Ben Casey\", \"The Defenders\", \"Route 66\", \"\" and \"St. Elsewhere\". Further television performances include the role of Hippolyta in the \"Wonder Woman\" series, and Marion Hillyard, the icy, controlling mother of Stephen Collins in \"The Promise\".\n\nStraight worked infrequently in film and is perhaps remembered best for her role as a devastated wife confronting husband William Holden's infidelity in \"Network\" (1976). She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Another widely seen film appearance was the role of the paranormal investigator Dr. Martha Lesh in the horror film \"Poltergeist\" (1982).\n\nOn February 22, 1942, Straight married Louis Dolivet, Free French Leader, in Polk County, Iowa. At the time, Dolivet was a speaker at the National Farm Institute and Straight was in the middle of the midwest road show of \"Twelfth Night\". Her mother Dorothy Elmhirst and stepfather Leonard K. Elmhirst attended the wedding with her brother Michael Straight and his wife Belinda Crompton. Dolivet was in the French Air Force until June 1940 and was the co-editor of \"The Free World\", a magazine published by the International Free World Association, of which he was secretary general. At the time of the wedding, her elder brother, Whitney Straight, had been missing since August 1941, when his plane was shot down on the French coast.\n\nStraight obtained a divorce from Dolivet in Reno, Nevada on May 24, 1949. Together they had one child:\n\nIn 1948, while starring in the Broadway production of \"The Heiress\", an adaptation of Henry James's \"Washington Square\", she met Peter Cookson. They married in 1949 and remained married until Cookson's death in 1990. Peter had two children from his previous marriage, Peter W. Cookson Jr. and Jane Coopland (n\u00e9e Cookson). Together, Straight and Cookson had two children: \n\nIn 1952, her 7-year-old son, Willard, from her first marriage, accidentally drowned in a pond on their farm in Armonk while playing in a small row boat tied to the dock. The boy was found by Cookson. The boy's father, Dolivet, who was living in Paris at the time, was refused a visa and, therefore, unable to fly to the United States to attend the funeral because of his alleged pro-communist activities, which he denied.\nStraight reportedly suffered from Alzheimer's disease in her last years. In 2001, she died from pneumonia in Northridge, Los Angeles, at the age of 86. Her interment was at William Henry Lee Memorial Cemetery in New Marlborough, Massachusetts.\n\n"

    "title": "Flying Elephant",
    "text": "The Flying Elephant was a proposed super-heavy tank, planned but never built by the British during World War I.\n\nAfter the last order for an additional fifty Mark I vehicles in April 1916, it was not certain that any more tanks were to be produced. Everything would depend on the success of the new weapon. William Tritton, co-designer and co-producer of the Mark I, thought he already understood what would prove to be its main weakness. A direct hit by a shell would destroy the vehicle, a major drawback on a battlefield saturated with artillery fire. Tritton decided to design a tank that would be immune to medium artillery fire in April 1916.\n\nTritton was unsure what this would entail. He did not know how thick the armour should be to ensure complete protection. The same month Lieutenant Kenneth Symes began to test 2 inch (51 mm) armour plate by firing at it with various captured German guns. In June, this programme was expanded by testing several types of plate at Shoeburyness, delivered by armour producer William Beardmore and Company. The Tank Supply Committee approved the production of a prototype on 19 June 1916, but the design was not to be finalised until late August 1916.\n\nPartial drawings have survived and show a vehicle long and about tall and three metres wide, not that much larger than the Mark I. However, the weight was estimated at roughly a hundred tons, much heavier than the 28 tons of the Mark I. The huge increase in weight came from the enormously thick armour for the time (three inches at the front, two inches on the sides). The hull roof consisted of a horizontal half-cylinder, apparently also with a uniform armour two inches thick. The front was a vertical half-cylinder, the transition between the two being a half-dome.\n\nMany sources claim that the main armament, a nose-mounted cannon, was a standard 57-millimetre 6-pounder gun. John Glanfield, in his history \"The Devil's Chariots\", states that it was a 75-millimetre or 13-pounder gun. A 6-pounder main gun for such a heavy machine would have meant half the main armament of contemporary vehicles. The preliminary design, for which partial blueprints are in the Albert Stern archive at King's College London, featured two six-pounders in sponsons either side of a bulbous nose equipped with no fewer than five machine guns. Each side had two machine-gun positions on the flanks, with two more at the rear (the original Foster drawings make this quite clear; the reproduction of the drawings in David Fletcher's book \"British Tanks 1915\u201319\" is cropped and makes the rear guns ambiguous in nature). Originally, the shell-proof tank was referred to simply as the Heavy Tank, then Foster's Battle Tank. Where the nickname 'Flying Elephant' came from no one knows for sure, though it was probably the result of the trunk-like nose gun, domed front, and enormous bulk combined with a traditional British lightheartedness.\nThe tank was fitted with two pairs of caterpillar tracks. The outer tracks resembled those of the Mark I, but were flatter and 61 centimetres wide, while a pair of additional, narrower tracks were fitted to the underside approximately 6 inches higher than the main tracks. They were not intended to be used for normal driving but were to be engaged to give extra traction over rough ground and would have helped to prevent \"bellying\", i.e. the tank becoming stuck on higher ground between the two outer tracks. All four tracks could be simultaneously driven by two Daimler 105 horsepower (78 kilowatt) engines, positioned on the centre-line, with the inner tracks connected to the main units via dog clutches. Each engine had its own primary gearbox, both of which drove into one single differential. This differential powered two secondary gearboxes, one for each main track. This differs from the solution chosen for the later Whippet in which each engine drove its own track.\n\nIt is certain that construction was started at some point, but did not result in a completed prototype. Albert Gerald Stern, the head of the Tank Supply Department, wrote that the War Office ordered the end of the project late in 1916, because it deemed mobility more important than protection.\n\nHistorian David Fletcher speculated that the project ran into trouble because the vehicle was grossly underpowered; top speed was estimated at two miles per hour, and it seems unlikely that it could have worked itself free when stuck in mud. The fact that the Mark I series turned out to be a success removed one of Tritton's main motives for building the heavier tank. However, John Glanfield writes that Tritton, in an effort to lighten the machine and make it more practicable, halved the thickness of the armour, reducing the overall weight to a still hefty 50\u201360 tons. Its appearance would have remained unchanged. Furthermore, the role of the Flying Elephant was changed from a vague 'attack' role to that of a 'tank-buster' when it was feared that the Germans were developing their own armoured fighting vehicles. Apparently, Stern planned to build twenty of the machines, before the project was cancelled.\n"

    "title": "Pretermitted heir",
    "text": "In the law of property, a pretermitted heir is a person who would likely stand to inherit under a will, except that the \"testator\" (the person who wrote the will) did not include the person in the testator's will. Omission may occur because the testator did not know of the omitted person at the time the will was written.\n\nA will may contain a clause that explicitly disinherits any heirs unknown at the time that the will is executed, or any heirs not named in the will. While such a clause will not necessarily prevent a claim against an estate by a pretermitted heir, it may make it more difficult to succeed in such an action.\n\nOne common category of pretermitted heir is the pretermitted child, born after the writing of the will. Claims may also potentially be brought by children born outside of the decedent's marital relationship.\n\nA person who claims to be a pretermitted child of a deceased parent may bring an action in probate court to contest the parent's will. Many jurisdictions have enacted statutes that permit a pretermitted child to demand an inheritance under the will. Some statutes allow a pretermitted child to claim their intestate share, while others limit the inheritance to an amount that is comparable to devises made in the will for the children who were alive when the will was written.\n\nSome jurisdictions provide the same rights for a child who was pretermitted because, although born \"before\" the will was executed, he was not \"known\" of at the time the will was made. This may be because the child was incorrectly believed to be dead, or was adopted by the testator after the will was drafted.\n\nSome jurisdictions prohibit a pretermitted child from claiming an inheritance if the will devised substantially all of the testator's estate to the surviving spouse, and the surviving spouse is the other parent of the pretermitted child. A child may also be denied the right to take under the will as a pretermitted heir if the child received an \"advancement\" against their inheritance - an \"inter vivos\" gift from the testator of an amount equivalent to what child might have otherwise received under the will.\n\nWhen a court finds that a child was pretermitted and is entitled to inheritance, in order to provide the child with an inheritance the court may proportionally reduce the gift under the will to the decedent's other children, or may reduce gifts under the will to non-family members.\n\nLaws in most nations provide protection for a pretermitted spouse, a spouse whom the testator does not marry until after the execution of the will. Many jurisdictions provide that a pretermitted spouse will receive either her intestate share (what she would have received had the testator died with no will), or an elective share of the deceased spouse's estate (a set amount or formula provided by law for spouses who are fully or partially disinherited in the will).\n\nLike a pretermitted child, a pretermitted spouse may be explicitly disinherited in the will, or may be excluded from taking under the will if they received an advancement on their inheritance in anticipation of the marriage. A pretermitted spouse may also disclaim any interest in the testator's estate through an antenuptial or prenuptial agreement.\n"

It was briefly screened theatrically in late 1987 and was broadcast on Channel 4 on 5 March 1988. It was released on VHS in the late 1980s, and became available on DVD when the entire \"Comic Strip Presents...\" series was released as a box set in the UK in June 2005. It has also been repeated occasionally on the Paramount Comedy Channel.\n\nRik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson are the (unnamed) proprietors of an escort agency, \"Dreamytime Escorts\". Mayall's character is devious, low-minded, calculating and stupid; Edmondson's merely very stupid.\n\nUnusually, rather than providing businessmen with female companionship, the activities of their escort agency essentially involve the pair swooping on unsuspecting foreigners who call them, and forcing them to take part in a drinking binge at their expense. The two are alcohol-obsessed; when their home-brewed beer (which takes a mere two days to brew and has a head made from washing-up liquid) isn't available, they steal from the delivery lorries pulling up at the off-licence downstairs: Edmondson's character dives out of the window into a large builders' bucket and is hauled back up by Mayall.\n\nTheir next-door neighbour is Mr. Jolly, a psychopathic contract killer played by Peter Cook. Jolly's \"modus operandi\" is to hack his victims to death with a meat cleaver while playing classic Tom Jones tunes from the 1960s to drown their cries.\n\nHeimi Henderson, who owns the off-licence downstairs, has refused demands for protection money by Mr. Lovebucket, an effete gangster played by Peter Richardson whose abiding love is his Citro\u00ebn DS car.\n\nMayall and Edmondson intercept a request intended for Mr. Jolly to \"take out\" the radio presenter and game show host Nicholas Parsons, who appears as himself. Parsons is due to open Henderson's off-licence, and Lovebucket wants to put a stop to it. Misinterpreting the request, they spend an evening with Parsons, who stays in their company because he believes them to be competition winners, the real ones having been pushed off the road by the Dreamytime Escorts' van in an earlier scene. The two are confronted the following morning by Lovebucket, who wants to know what they've done with the money provided with the contract (which they have used to buy 1574 large gin and tonics). Lovebucket insists that they complete the contract.\n\nThe two return to Parsons's house armed with a gun, chainsaw and grenades but fail to kill him as he leaves by helicopter to the off-licence to open it. They chase after the helicopter with Lovebucket and his gang pursuing them but crash their van into a skip. Parsons reaches the off-licence but can't find Henderson so he goes upstairs and meets Mr. Jolly and is presumably killed by him.\n\nMayall and Edmondson got into their office and start packing their suitcases to go and live in Rio but see into Jolly's office and watch him talking to Lovebucket. Some of the gang members go into their office only to find it empty as the two have escaped through the window into the off-licence where they are told by Henderson that Parsons is opening it, much to their excitement. Shortly after Henderson overhears the two talking about killing Parsons, causing Mayall to shoot him dead, but tricks Edmondson into thinking he did it. Edmondson decides to have a drink but instead takes a bottle of explosive tonic water from a shelf causing an explosion in the off-licence.\n\nIt is revealed during the credits that the two survived and are walking along a canal where Mayall knocks Edmondson into it before walking off with Edmondson swimming after him.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Dice pool",
    "text": "In some role-playing game systems, the dice pool is the number of dice that a player is allowed to roll when attempting to perform a certain action.\n\nIn many RPG systems, non-trivial actions often require dice rolls. Some RPGs roll a fixed number of dice, add a number to the die roll based on the character's attributes and skills, and compare the resulting number with a difficulty rating. However, in other systems the character's attributes and skills determine the number of dice to be rolled.\n\nDice pool systems generally use a single size of die, the most common being six- or ten-sided dice (d6s or d10s), though in some games a character's Attributes or Skills may determine the size of the dice in the pool, as well as their number (\"Deadlands\" is an example). While such games may require different sized dice for different rolls, the dice in a given pool are usually all of the same size.\n\nThe results on each die may be added together and compared to a target number (as in \"Over the Edge\"), or the player may count the number of dice which roll higher than a specified target number, and compare that to a required number of \"successes\" (as in early editions of \"Shadowrun\" or the Storyteller System). In systems using the latter method, the target number required for a success may be fixed (the same for every roll) or variable (assigned depending on the difficulty of a task); the number of successes required may indicate the degree of success, or a minimum number of successes may be required as another means of determining difficulty. Another variation is that a number of dice are rolled, but only some are added together (as in the \"Roll and Keep\" system used by \"Legend of the Five Rings\" and \"7th Sea\").\n\nIn dice pool systems it is common to add or subtract dice from the pool to represent different circumstances.\n\nPenalties may temporarily reduce the dice pool for one or more skills (for example, a leg wound may reduce the dice pool for actions such as running, climbing, and jumping), and are usually fixed numbers (i.e. the leg wound may reduce a pool by two dice).\n\nBonuses may temporarily increase dice pools, and usually represent beneficial circumstances (e.g. a character may have a powerful computer to aid her in a database search) or some special effort on the character's part (an effort of will, a strong desire to succeed, or even a supernatural power). Circumstantial bonuses are also usually fixed numbers - the computer above might grant two additional dice, for example - while character traits which grant bonuses are usually an expendable resource, representing special effort. This may take the form of \"points\" (e.g. \"Willpower points\" in the Storytelling System), or an extra pool of dice which may be allocated to other pools to augment rolls (e.g. the Combat and Karma pools of earlier edition \"Shadowrun\").\n\nOther complications may be used to simulate luck, superhuman ability or other conditions; a common one is to allow high (or low) rolling dice to be rolled again, the second roll counting as if it were an additional die.\n\nDice pools are more complex to explain and less intuitive than traditional \"roll over\" or \"roll under\" systems. On the other hand, they are faster to resolve if there are a lot of modifiers as it's easier to count each individual die that succeeded than it is to add four or five separate modifiers to a die roll. Therefore, whether dice pools are faster depends on how much detail the system goes into. They also provide players with a physical representation for the modifiers, as real, concrete dice are added to the pool (or taken away from it). Some people also find rolling a large handful of dice fun in its own right.\n\nThe other thing dice pools allow is opening up a lot of design space for game designers; if something other than the number on the dice is important, the number itself can be used to add richness to the system.\n\nWest End Games's \"Ghostbusters\" role-playing game by Greg Stafford, Lynn Willis, and Sandy Petersen featured a d6 system with an additive dice pool that was applied to characteristics and skills. The first widely successful game to feature dice pools was Greg Costikyan's \"\" (1987), developing the system pioneered the year before in \"Ghostbusters\". (Both games were published by West End Games; Costikyan consulted on \"Ghostbusters\".)\n\n\"Shadowrun\" (1989), designed by Bob Charrette, Paul Hume, and Tom Dowd, used a comparative dice pool, where a set of six-sided dice were rolled and each individual die was compared to a target number, with the number of successes then showing the final outcome of the task. \"Shadowrun\" was probably the first game to use the \"success\" mechanic rather than adding the dice together. Dowd refined the dice pool system for White Wolf Publishing's \"\" (1991). \"Vampire\" and \"Over the Edge\" (1992) were written by \"Ars Magica\" designers Mark Rein-Hagen and Jonathan Tweet respectively, the pair having been impressed by the potential of the dice pool mechanic and each having decided to make their own game based on dice pools. The majority of White Wolf Publishing's subsequent games use variations on \"Vampire\"'s Storyteller System, and so also make use of the dice pool mechanic.\n\n"

With my dad, I lived in a beautiful house with a swimming pool and a tennis court and went to Europe for the summers. So I feel like I lived two childhoods.\" She worked as a teenage fashion model, and took acting classes at the suggestion of her aunt, former \"Let's Make a Deal\" spokesmodel Carol Merrill. She eventually came to support herself, and with her parents' support, was legally emancipated by the time she was 16.\n\nGugino's television work during the late 1980s and early 1990s included appearances on \"Good Morning, Miss Bliss\", \"Who's the Boss?\", \"ALF\", \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\", \"The Wonder Years\" and a recurring role on \"Falcon Crest\".\n\nIn film, Gugino appeared in the Shelley Long film \"Troop Beverly Hills\", and co-starred with Pauly Shore in the 1993 romantic comedy \"Son in Law\".

Charles Isherwood of \"The New York Times\" praised Gugino's performance, saying, \"Ms. Gugino displays a depth and range of expression that I cannot imagine any other actress achieving with such blazing honesty and wrenching truth. She is simply magnificent.\" During the first three months of 2009, three feature films premiered featuring Gugino: the thriller \"The Unborn\", the film \"Watchmen\", in which she played Sally Jupiter, and the adventure remake \"Race to Witch Mountain\", in which she starred opposite Dwayne Johnson.

    "title": "Vincent Nichols",
    "text": "Vincent Gerard Nichols (born 8 November 1945) is an English cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, Archbishop of Westminster and President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. He previously served as Archbishop of Birmingham from 2000 to 2009. On 22 February 2014, Pope Francis admitted Archbishop Nichols to the Sacred College of Cardinals at a general consistory.\n\nVincent Gerard Nichols was born in 1945, The Precincts, in Crosby, Lancashire, to Henry Joseph and Mary (n\u00e9e Russell) Nichols, both teachers. As a child he wanted to be a lorry driver, but felt a calling to the priesthood as a teenager.\n\nHe attended St Peter and Paul's Junior School on Liverpool Road, Crosby before joining St Mary's College, Crosby, from 1956 to 1963. From St. Mary's he entered the Venerable English College, Rome. He was ordained for the Archdiocese of Liverpool on 21 December 1969 by Archbishop Paul Marcinkus. He obtained an STL in Theology & Philosophy from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1970.\n\nUpon his return to Britain, Nichols studied at the University of Manchester for a year and earned an MA degree in Theology in 1971, specialising in the theology of St. John Fisher. He then served as assistant pastor at St Mary's Church, Wigan, as well as chaplain to St John Rigby College, Wigan, and St Peter's Catholic High School, Wigan.\n\nHe received a MEd degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1974 and was assigned to St. Anne's Church in Edge Hill in 1975. Father Nichols spent a total of 14 years in the Liverpool archdiocese. In 1980, he was appointed director of the Upholland Northern Institute. He also sat on the archiepiscopal council.\n\nNichols served as General Secretary of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales (CBCEW) from 1984 to 1993. In addition to his role within the CBCEW, he was moderator of the Steering Committee of the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland from 1989 to 1996. He was chairman of the Catholic Education Service from 1998.\n\nOn 5 November 1991, Nichols was appointed Auxiliary bishop of Westminster and Titular bishop of \"Othona\" by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 24 January 1992 from Cardinal Basil Hume, OSB, with Archbishop Derek Worlock and Bishop Alan Clark serving as co-consecrators, at Westminster Cathedral.\n\nAt the age of 46, he was the youngest Catholic bishop in the United Kingdom. He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Fortis Ut Mors Dilectio\", meaning, \"Love Is Strong As Death\" Song of Solomon 8:6.\n\nAs an auxiliary, Nichols served as vicar for North London. He was appointed to the finance advisory committee of the National Catholic Fund in 1994 and to the CBCEW's Committee for the Roman Colleges in 1995, and became Episcopal Liaison of the CBCEW for the National Conference of Diocesan Financial Secreatries in 1996.\n\nIn 1998, he was made chairman of the CBCEW Department for Catholic Education and Formation, as well as chairman of the Catholic Education Service. Nichols represented the European bishops at the November 1998 Synod of Bishops from Oceania, and was a special secretary at the Synod of Bishops for Europe in September 1999. He was celebrant of the Requiem Mass for Cardinal Hume in 1999.\n\nOn 15 February 2000, Nichols was appointed the eighth Archbishop of Birmingham by Pope John Paul II, succeeding the French-born Maurice Couve de Murville. He was installed as archbishop on the following 29 March. He received the pallium from Pope John Paul II in Rome on 29 June 2000, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, at the same time as Cormac Murphy-O'Connor received his as Metropolitan of Westminster. Prior to his appointment to Birmingham, he had been considered a leading contender to replace the late Cardinal Hume as Archbishop of Westminster; the position went to Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, although Nichols would later succeed him.\n\nIn 2001, Nichols became chairman of the management board of the Catholic Office for the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults. He is also a patron of the International Young Leaders Network based at Blackfriars, Oxford. In 2008, he was named President of the Commission for Schools, Universities, and Catechesis in the Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe. He is lead episcopal trustee of the three English seminaries outside the United Kingdom \u2013 The Royal English College, Valladolid, as well as the Beda College and the Venerable English Colleges in Rome. He is assisted in this role by two further episcopal trustees \u2013 Archbishop Arthur Roche, Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and Mark Jabal\u00e9, Bishop Emeritus of Menevia. He undertakes at least one \"visitation\" to each of these seminaries in each academic year.\n\nHe provided the commentary for the BBC's coverage of the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005.\n\nBy virtue of his status as ordinary of the Birmingham diocese, Nichols was Chairman of the Governing Body of Newman University College (now Newman University). Nichols has been an advocate of the cause of canonisation for Cardinal John Henry Newman. Nichols oversaw the attempted removal of Newman's remains from his grave in Worcestershire to the Birmingham Oratory in 2008, however on the opening of the grave no human remains were recoverable.\n\nNichols wrote two books: \"Promise of Future Glory\" and \"Missioners\"; and had the inspiration for the \"Walk with Me\" programme, which sought to bring people together in spiritual accompaniment through the seasons of the Church\u2019s year. The initiative later spread to other dioceses.\n\nNichols was appointed the eleventh Archbishop of Westminster by Pope Benedict XVI on 3 April 2009, and solemnly installed on 21 May 2009. The diocese, the principal see of the Church in England and Wales, serves 472,600 Catholics. It was reported that Benedict XVI personally selected Nichols for the post after the Congregation for Bishops failed to reach a consensus.\n\nIn the time leading up to the appointment, Nichols' name had been repeatedly mentioned as a possible successor to Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, and his name was the only one to be on both \"ternas\", or shortlist of candidates submitted to the Congregation for Bishops. A group of English Catholic bishops, as well as a member of parliament, had even expressed their concerns of promoting Nichols to Westminster to the Apostolic Nuncio, Faustino Sainz Mu\u00f1oz, citing the archbishop's ambition.\n\nIn his decision to accept the \"daunting\" role of Archbishop of Westminster, Nichols said he \"just swallowed hard and said 'yes.'\"\n\nHe succeeded Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor, who reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 in 2007. Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor described his successor as \"competent, compassionate, and experienced.\"\n\nAs expected, Nichols was elected President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales by unanimous acclamation on 30 April 2009.\n\nHe received his second pallium from Pope Benedict XVI in Rome on 29 June 2009, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul.\n\nHe was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops on 16 December 2013 by Pope Francis. On 19 February 2014. he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.\n\nOn 12 January 2014 Pope Francis announced that Nichols would be created a cardinal at the consistory of the Church held on 22 February 2014. Cardinal Nichols was formally elevated to the Sacred College of Cardinals by Pope Francis on 22 February 2014, receiving the traditional red biretta and gold ring during a ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica. He was created Cardinal-Priest of Santissimo Redentore e Sant'Alfonso in Via Merulana.\n\nHis coat of arms includes a blue wavy band on a silver shield to represent the River Mersey, scallop shells to represent the Venerable English College in Rome, the red rose of Lancashire and anchors representing Liverpool: surmounted by the customary red galero (ecclesiastical hat) with thirty red cords and tassels (for a cardinal).\n\nOnce considered to be liberal, Nichols was described by Damian Thompson of \"The Daily Telegraph\" as having moved to more conservative positions. Elena Curti of \"The Tablet\" suggested this was the result of advice early in his career from Archbishop Worlock to make himself more \"Vatican-friendly\" if he was to get ahead in the Church hierarchy. Before his enthronement as Archbishop of Westminster, he was vocal in defending the public reputation of the Catholic Church, notably criticising the BBC for what he called \"biased and hostile\" programming, which contributed to the decision by the BBC not to show the animated sitcom \"Popetown\".\n\nIn August 2010, Nichols expressed support for the echoes of Catholic social teaching emerging in the language of the new Coalition Government. In particular, he supported Prime Minister David Cameron's call for a \"Big Society\". Nichols said that \"It gives us an experience of being together in a place that turns things on their head a bit\". He expressed excitement at the potential for the Coalition and wrote that he had become disillusioned with the previous Labour government: \"The last government was too overarching. In attempting to create a state that provided everything, it ended up losing touch with the people it was trying to serve.\" In April 2011, however, he was critical about the effectiveness of the Big Society, saying, \"It is all very well to deliver speeches about the need for greater voluntary activity, but there needs to be some practical solutions. The Big Society [...] has no teeth [...] and should not be used as a cloak for masking central cuts\"\n\nNichols defended the ban of the church on communion for the divorced and remarried. He hoped that the Synod on the Family would clarify the teachings of the church on the Eucharist. He said that although usually one partakes in communion based on one's own conscience, the divorced remarried publicly defied church teachings.\n\nWhile he was Archbishop of Birmingham, he had to respond to the sexual abuse cases that were alleged in that diocese. Among his first public acts in his role as Archbishop of Westminster was a statement on the issue of clerical physical and sexual abuse in Ireland following a government report into the running of industrial schools. In his own words: \"Every time there is a single incident of abuse in the Catholic Church it is a scandal. And I'm glad it's a scandal.\" He was, however, criticised widely on the issue of priests facing up to their crimes, where he claimed, \"That takes courage, and also we shouldn't forget that this account today will also overshadow all of the good that they also did.\"\n\nNichols played a prominent role in producing the 1996 CBCEW document, \"Common Good and Catholic Social Teaching\", in which the English Catholic bishops condemned the rhetoric of greed in a move interpreted as an endorsement of New Labour.\n\nIn 2004, he prominently intervened in an argument pitching religious offence against artistic freedom when he criticised Birmingham Repertory Theatre for showing the play \"Behzti\" (\"Dishonour\"), which depicted scenes of sexual abuse and murder in a Sikh temple. He argued that the Sikh community had acted in a \"reasonable and measured way\" in representing their concerns. \"\"Such a deliberate, even if fictional, violation of the sacred place of the Sikh religion demeans the sacred places of every religion. People of all faiths, therefore, will be offended by this presentation.\"\"\n\nIn March 2009, he allowed the Catholic chapel at a Roman Catholic college in Birmingham to be used for the commemoration of the birth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad with interfaith debate in the college chapel, sparking some local controversy. Nichols defended the location of the celebration, saying through his spokesman, \"Christian/Muslim dialogue is an important part of the Catholic Church's agenda.\"\n\nIn November 2009, he \"offered flowers at the altar to the deities\" during a visit to the Hindu Temple in Neasden. When the action occasioned press comment, details of the episode were removed from the Diocese of Westminster's website.\n\nOn 20 October 2009, Cardinal William Levada and Archbishop Joseph Di Noia held a press conference in which they announced that Pope Benedict XVI was preparing to release an apostolic constitution that would allow Anglicans, both laity and clergy, to join the Catholic Church in groups and maintain their corporate identity in new Personal Ordinariates for former Anglicans entering the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nA joint statement on the new protocol from Nichols and the Anglican Communion's head, Archbishop Rowan Williams of Canterbury, was issued at the same time in London. The joint statement said that the development reflected \"substantial overlap in faith, doctrine and spirituality between the Catholic Church and the Anglican tradition\" and affirmed \"on-going official dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion\", including the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) and International Anglican Roman Catholic Commission for Unity and Mission (IARCCUM).\n\nHowever, Canon Giles Fraser, an Anglican canon of St Paul's Cathedral, preaching at an ecumenical service at Nichols' own cathedral in Westminster, suggested \"...there are some \u2013 and indeed in both churches \u2013 who do not see it like this at all. For from the Anglican perspective, this new invitation to swim the Tiber can sometimes have a slightly predatory feel; in corporate terms, a little like a take over bid in some broader power play of church politics.\"\n\nNichols supported the effort to have Catholic adoption agencies exempted from sexual orientation regulations. His position was qualified by his statement during a BBC interview that he would not oppose adoption by a gay person that was single. Mary Ann Sieghart, a journalist, commenting for \"The Times\" on Nichols' statements on the subject, observed that \"had the Catholic position been more hardline, it might have stood more of a chance.\"\n\nIn 2012 Nichols condemned same-sex marriage proposals, calling it an \"undemocratic, Orwellian shambles\". Nichols also told teachers at Catholic schools that they could not marry divorced people, enter into civil unions or same-sex marriages and yet retain their jobs. In 2013 Nichols put an end to masses for LGBT people at Our Lady of the Assumption Church in Warwick Street, Soho. The church would instead be used by conservative converts from Anglicanism.\n\nArchbishop Nichols said: \"The moral teaching of the Church is that the proper use of our sexual faculty is within a marriage, between a man and a woman, open to the procreation and nurturing of new human life.\"\n\nIn 2006, Nichols denounced then-Secretary for Education Alan Johnson's plan to introduce a quota for non-Catholic pupils at Catholic schools as \"insulting\", \"divisive\" and \"ill thought-out, unworkable and contradictory of empirical evidence\". He mobilised over 2,000 Catholic school headteachers in his campaign and the plan was eventually dropped. \n\nIn August 2009, he warned that in his view the overuse by young people of online social networking websites (such as Facebook and MySpace) encouraged teenagers to build \"transient relationships\" that can leave them traumatised and even suicidal when they collapse: \"We're losing some of the ability to build interpersonal communication that's necessary for living together and building a community.\"\n\nIn October 2010 Nichols made a defence of Catholic prison chaplaincy in a speech at HM Prison Brixton in London. He criticised suggestions that amid budget cuts the state should only fund a single \"generic chaplaincy\" in British prisons. He said:\nIn 2011, Nichols and former MP Ann Widdecombe supported a petition to stop the owners of a London pub changing its name. \"The Cardinal\", near Westminster Cathedral, was due to be renamed the \"Windsor Castle\" when it reopened after refurbishment. More than 150 people signed the petition organised by the Independent Catholic News newspaper. The pub had been named after a former Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, Henry Edward Manning. Nichols said that although the pub was originally called the Windsor Castle, the name \"the Cardinal\" has a better historical connection to the area and that \"The reason why it was changed was because of the great impact that Cardinal Manning had on the life of London\". Despite the petition, the pub was renamed.\n\nNichols has urged Catholic academics, charities, politicians, theologians and lay Catholics to work towards the \"\"Church for the poor\"\" that Pope Francis advocated. \nNichols believes society has a moral imperative \n\nNichols stressed the need for fair wages, stating the private sector, the social sector, the state and all who have people depending on them for a livelihood are challenged by this.\n\nNichols argued in 2014 that government changes to social security had \"\"torn apart\"\" the \"\" basic safety net\"\" for very poor families and called them a \"\"disgrace\"\". He claimed that people are risking \"\"destitution\"\" and that the administration of social security has become steadily more \"\"punitive\"\", forcing people to rely on food banks and leaving them with nothing if forms are filled in incorrectly.\n\nHe is the patron of the Passage, a day centre for homeless people founded by the Daughters of Charity near Westminster Cathedral.\n\nAs Cardinal Nichols, he spoke out against the use of arguments and campaigns which stoke up \"distress\" about foreigners coming to the UK. His comments came amid a furore over a \u00a31.5 million advertising campaign by the UK Independence Party which includes billboards suggesting to people that millions of foreigners are after their job.\n\nDuring a visit to the port of Tilbury in June 2015, Cardinal Nichols paid tribute to seafarers' professionalism and dedication and the sacrifices they make to support their families. He stressed the Church, through its maritime mission agency, the Apostleship of the Sea, would continue to support their faith and welfare needs.\n\nOn 3 November 2016 it was reported that Cardinal Nichols officially acknowledged that the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales had pressurized young, unmarried mothers in the country to put their children up for adoption in agencies linked to the Catholic Church throughout the decades following World War II and offered an apology.\n\n\n\n\n \n"

    "text": "G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane Province () is a province in northern Turkey, bordering Bayburt to the east, Trabzon to the north, Giresun and Erzincan to the west. It covers an area of 6,575\u00a0km\u00b2 and has a population of 129,618 in 2010. The population was 186,953 in 2000. The name \"G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane\" means silver house. The city has a rich mining (silver and bronze) history and was the source of exports for Trabzon. The current Governor is Kamuran Ta\u015fbilek, he was appointed on the 27 October 2019.\n\nG\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane is the capital city of the province.\n\nG\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane is surrounded by high mountains, Zigana-Trabzon Mountains to the north, \u00c7imen Mountains to the south, Giresun Mountains to the west and Pulur, So\u011fanl\u0131 Mountains to the east. Trekking is popular sport is at these mountains. The Zigana Mountain has a ski center on it and it is a well known touristic place for winter sports. Abdal Musa Peak (3331 m.) is the highest peak within it. The main trees in the forests are Scotch pine and fir, and there are many animals and birds in the area. There are many lakes such as Karanl\u0131k G\u00f6l, Be\u015f G\u00f6ller, Artebel G\u00f6l\u00fc, Kara G\u00f6ller which are at the peak of Gavurda\u011f\u0131 Mountain, and are preserved as natural parks. Mountainous territory comprises 56% of the total area of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane province.\nIn September 1935 the third Inspectorate General (\"Umumi M\u00fcfetti\u015flik,\" UM) was created. Its creation was based on the Law 1164 from June 1927, which was passed in order to Turkefy the population. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, Erzincan and A\u011fr\u0131. It was governed by a Inspector General seated in the city of Erzurum. The Inspectorate General was dissolved in 1952 during the Government of the Democrat Party.\n\nG\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane province is divided into 6 districts (capital district in bold):\n\nHistorically, the province had silver mines. However, production ceased due to deforestation by 1920.\n\n"

    "title": "American Nightmare (US band)",
    "text": "American Nightmare (briefly known as Give Up the Ghost) is a hardcore punk band from Boston, Massachusetts. They have released three albums, one EP and a compilation of earlier released material under the name American Nightmare.\n\nAmerican Nightmare was formed when Tim Cossar and Wesley Eisold (who was then a roadie for Ten Yard Fight) met up with Azy Relph and Jesse Van Diest in 1998. They recorded a demo tape in 1999, followed by their debut release, a self-titled EP on Bridge 9 Records in 2000. After extensive touring and line-up changes, the band recorded their second EP, \"The Sun Isn't Getting Any Brighter\". This was later combined with their self-titled effort to form \"Year One\", which was released by Reflections Records in 2001 and reissued posthumously by Bridge 9.\n\nTheir debut full-length, \"Background Music\", was recorded for Equal Vision Records in 2001 and was released to much acclaim. In 2003, the band faced a legal battle with a similarly named band from Philadelphia. The band then changed their name briefly to the initials \"A.N.\" then to American Nothing for a brief period. After the other American Nightmare threatened to file suit again, they changed their name to Give Up the Ghost (which was intended to be the name of their second album). Their second full length, \"We're Down Til We're Underground\" released on Equal Vision, displayed the band experimenting with their sound, with longer songs that didn't follow the typical hardcore songwriting formula they had adhered to in their previous releases.\n\nThe band broke up suddenly in June 2004, a day after announcing the cancellation of a European tour. The band issued a statement which cited \"health and personal reasons\" for the split. Members went on to join/form other bands such as Cold Cave, Some Girls, XO Skeletons, Ye Olde Maids, Head Automatica, Bars, and the Hope Conspiracy. Give Up the Ghost came back into the headlines in 2007 under accusations that Fall Out Boy had taken lyrics from Wes Eisold, the band's lyricist, resulting in an out-of-court settlement and a credit in the liner notes of both the multi-platinum selling \"From Under the Cork Tree\" and \"Infinity on High\".\n\nAfter seven years of disbandment, the band reunited under their original name and performed two reunion shows in December 2011. The band performed in Revere, Massachusetts on December 29, and in Los Angeles on December 31. Deathwish Inc. reissued the albums \"Background Music\" (2001) and \"We're Down Til We're Underground\" (2003) to coincide with the reunion dates. Since the original 2011 reunion shows, American Nightmare have played a small handful of shows almost every year. In November 2017 they announced a new album for release on 16 February 2018 through Rise Records. The first track from the self-titled album, \"The World Is Blue\", was released 19 December 2017.\n\nAmerican Nightmare have been categorised as hardcore punk, melodic hardcore and emo. Their music was a reaction against the lyrical positivity of Youth Crew revival bands that had been popular in Boston at the time like In My Eyes, Floorpunch and Bane. The band persused a more dark and nihilistic sound in comparison through the influence of The Smiths and Joy Division. Other influences include Black Flag, the Cro-Mags and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Their music often makes use of high-tempos, breakdowns, gang vocals and singalongs. They have been cited as an influence by The White Noise, Frameworks, Killing The Dream, Defeater, Touch\u00e9 Amor\u00e9 and Dead Swans.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Sergei Winogradsky",
    "text": "Sergei Nikolaievich Winogradsky (or Vinogradskiy; ; 1 September 1856 \u2013 25 February 1953) was a Russian microbiologist, ecologist and soil scientist who pioneered the cycle-of-life concept.\n\nWinogradsky discovered the first known form of lithotrophy during his research with \"Beggiatoa\" in 1887. He reported that \"Beggiatoa\" oxidized hydrogen sulfide (HS) as an energy source and formed intracellular sulfur droplets. This research provided the first example of lithotrophy, but not autotrophy.\n\nHis research on nitrifying bacteria would report the first known form of chemoautotrophy, showing how a lithotroph fixes carbon dioxide (CO) to make organic compounds.\n\nWinogradsky was born in Kiev (then in the Russian Empire). In this early stage of his life, Winogradsky was \"strictly devoted to the orthodox faith\", though he later became irreligious.\n\nHe entered the Imperial Conservatoire of Music in St Petersburg in 1875 to study piano. However, after two years of music training, he entered the University of Saint Petersburg in 1877 to study chemistry under Nikolai Menshutkin and botany under Andrei Sergeevich Famintzin.\n\nHe received a diploma in 1881 and stayed at the St. Petersburg University for a degree of master of science in botany in 1884. In 1885, he began work at the University of Strasbourg under the renowned botanist Anton de Bary; Winogradsky became renowned for his work on sulfur bacteria.\n\nIn 1888, he relocated to Zurich, where he began investigation into the process of nitrification, identifying the genera \"Nitrosomonas\" and \"Nitrosococcus\", which oxidizes ammonium to nitrite, and \"Nitrobacter\", which oxidizes nitrite to nitrate.\n\nHe returned to St. Petersburg for the period 1891\u20131905, and headed the division of general microbiology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine. During this period, he identified the obligate anaerobe \"Clostridium pasteurianum\", which is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. In St. Petersburg, he trained his only student und assistant Vasily Omelianski which popularized Winogradskys concepts and methodology in the Soviet Union during the next decades.\n\nIn 1901, he was elected honorary member of the Moscow Society of Naturalists and, in 1902, corresponding member of the French Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe retired from active scientific work in 1905, dividing his time between his private estate and Switzerland. In 1922, he accepted an invitation to head the division of agricultural bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute at an experimental station at Brie-Comte-Robert, France, about 30\u00a0km from Paris. During this period, he worked on a number of topics, among them iron bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, nitrogen fixation by \"Azotobacter\", cellulose-decomposing bacteria, and culture methods for soil microorganisms. Winogradsky retired from active life in 1940 and died in Brie-Comte-Robert in 1953.\n\nWinogradsky discovered various biogeochemical cycles and parts of these cycles. These discoveries include\n\nWinogradsky is best known for discovering chemoautotrophy, which soon became popularly known as chemosynthesis, the process by which organisms derive energy from a number of different inorganic compounds and obtain carbon in the form of carbon dioxide. Previously, it was believed that autotrophs obtained their energy solely from light, not from reactions of inorganic compounds. With the discovery of organisms that oxidized inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium as energy sources, autotrophs could be divided into two groups: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs. Winogradsky was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand microorganisms outside of the medical context, making him among the first students of microbial ecology and environmental microbiology.\n\nThe Winogradsky column remains an important display of chemoautotrophy and microbial ecology, demonstrated in microbiology lectures around the world.\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Project Space Station",
    "text": "Project Space Station is a simulation game written Commodore 64 and published in 1985 by HESware. It was ported to the Apple II and IBM PC compatibles.\n\nIn the game the player is put in control of NASA and tasked with building and maintaining a space station and generating enough money with commercial contracts to make up for an anemic yearly budget. This can be seen as a discrete set of phases, except that they all proceed simultaneously. The exception is at the beginning of the game where the player has unlimited time in the planning phase before the game clock starts.\n\nIn the planning phase, the player first allocates the funds they have to various budget items, like crew selection, station modules, and research and development. Then they choose their crew, who have intrinsic task sets (like piloting and physics), and varying levels of competence and compatibility with other potential employees. From there the player purchases equipment like space suits and satellites, and station modules like laboratories and solar arrays. Then they schedule their launches using the two space shuttles available (\"Atlantis\" and \"Discovery\", though the initial release used the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\"), and have their budget approved. In the final stage of the planning phase the player can create a simulated station with an unlimited number of parts, and without dealing with the later constrictions of the EVA.\n\nThe launch phase has the player decide whether launch conditions are stable enough to merit launch. If they give the implicit go-ahead, they engage in a light arcade sequence where the player attempts to keep the shuttle on course throughout its orbital burn. The more successful the player is, the closer the shuttle will be to the station.\n\nOnce the shuttle is in orbit, the player is tasked to assemble the components they brought up (or to fire off any satellites they have contracts for) in the Extra-Vehicular Activity, or EVA phase. Here the player directly controls an Orbital Construction Pod, a small ship with mechanical arms that an astronaut can use to move large equipment. Being careless here could have consequences as the pod or equipment may become damaged, and it may run out of fuel and become stranded until another pod can rescue it. Consequences were not limited to equipment damage: Stranded astronauts in pods could die when oxygen ran out. Other crew hazards included solar flares, which could kill astronauts on the station or shuttle if precautions (using an emergency module in station design) were not taken. Crew died in reverse alphabetical order from solar flares.\n\nThe player then transfers crew to and from the space station and assigns them to research tasks. Completing these tasks awards the player with government contracts that supplement NASA's budget. A math bug (or intentional cheat) in the game allowed an infinite supply of money, if the player allocated more than $10,000K to any budget. For example, if $800k is spent, the budget would be recalculated to $19,200K instead of $9,200, as expected.\n\nFinally the player lands the shuttle. After determining that landing conditions are adequate, the player again keeps the shuttle on course as it turns from the station and enters its descent. Skill here determines how close the shuttle will be to the optimal point from the runway. After this the player controls the shuttle with a simple landing simulator viewed from the side. The more abrupt or overshot the landing, the more damage will be done to the shuttle and the longer it will need to be repaired before it can venture out on another mission.\n\nThe game is played using a menu system. Every option can be queried for in-game help, and every major task has a tutorial that simulates that task without the consequences of failure, and sometimes with additional assistance (like being able to pause a landing attempt). Another major feature is the message system that alerts the player when there are changes to mission status, wherever the player might be within the menu system.\n\n\"Info\" rated \"Project Space Station\" five stars out of five, describing it as \"probably one of the most ambitious programs ever developed for the Commodore 64 ... a fun, complex simulation\".\n\n\n"

    "title": "Law of Christ",
    "text": "\"The law of Christ\" () is a New Testament phrase of uncertain meaning, found only in the Pauline Epistles at Galatians 6:2 and parenthetically ( \"being under the law to Christ\") at 1 Corinthians 9:21.\n\nSome Christians hold the belief that the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the inauguration of the New Covenant of Jeremiah 31:31-37 and Ezekiel 37:22-38 \"replaces\" or \"completes\" or \"fulfills\" the Law of Moses found in the Hebrew Bible. Dual-covenant theologians, Calvinists, the Hebrew Roots Movement, and Messianic Judaism are all examples of a groups that reject this belief.\n\nClosely related are the subjects of Christian views on the Old Covenant, early Christianity and Judaism, Paul the Apostle and Judaism, abrogation of old covenant laws, and Christian ethics.\n\nIn the Epistle to the Galatians, written by the Apostle Paul to a number of early Christian communities in the Roman province of Galatia in central Anatolia, he wrote: \"Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.\" (, NKJV). This phrase appears once and is never defined. It has been suggested that \"the law of Christ\" could be an allusion to the second greatest commandment (\"love thy neighbor\") or the New Commandment (\"love one another; as I have loved you\"). Others suggest this phrase is just another name for \"the law of God\" as Christians believe the Messiah is God.\n\nPossibly related, in a letter to the early Christians of Corinth, Greece, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul wrote: \"To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law.\" (, NIV). In the Greek, the wording is, \"to those without law, as without law -- (not being without law to God, but within law to Christ) -- that I might gain those without law.\" (1 Corinthians 9:21, YLT)\n\nIt is not clear exactly what Paul means by the phrase, \"the law of Christ\". Although Paul mentions Biblical law several times (e.g., , , , , , , ) and preached about Ten Commandment topics such as idolatry (e.g., , , , , , , , , ), he consistently denies that salvation, or justification before God, is based on \"works of the law\" (e.g., ), though the meaning of this phrase is also disputed by scholars, see for example the New Perspective on Paul#Works of the Law.\n\nMany Christians believe that the Sermon on the Mount is a form of commentary on the Ten Commandments. It portrays Christ as the true interpreter of the Mosaic Law. In the Expounding of the Law, Jesus said that he did not come to abolish the law or the prophets, but to fulfill them (). Jesus explicitly warns of severe concequence to those who break and teach others to break one of the least of the commands of God (Matthew 5:19 KJV) In the apocryphal Gospel of Marcion's version of Luke 23:2 we find the extension: \"We found this fellow perverting the nation \"and destroying the law and the prophets\"\".\n\nWhile the New Testament records several unique sayings of Jesus that may be described as \"commandments,\" it only records one that he explicitly identified as such. This is the New Commandment of that the disciples should love one another as he himself had loved them.\n\nThese commandments are commonly seen as a basis of Christian ethics.\n\n uses the phrases of \"royal law\" and \"law of liberty\" in reference to the Second greatest commandment, part of :\n\nIn his Summa Theologiae I-II qq. 106-109, a section of the \"Summa\" known as the \"Treatise on Law\", Saint Thomas Aquinas discusses the Law of Christ as the \"New Law\". He argues that it was virtually contained in the Old Law, that is the Old Testament, as a seed but only brought to perfection by Jesus Christ who perfectly fulfilled it. The ends of the Old and New are one and the same, being subjection to God's order, but they are different in that the New Law makes attaining the end possible. Meanwhile, since all law ultimately has reference to Divine Reason governing all things, the New Law contains and helps the human being fulfill the Natural Law which prescribes acts of virtue. Thus, Aquinas defines the New Law as \"chiefly the grace itself of the Holy Ghost, which is given to those who believe in Christ, \" but adds that it also \"contains certain things that dispose us to receive the grace of the Holy Ghost, and pertaining to the use of that grace.\" Therefore,\"the New Law is in the first place a law that is inscribed on our hearts, but that secondarily it is a written law\".(ST I-II q. 106.3) \n\nThe Catholic theologian Bernhard H\u00e4ring presents the Law of Christ as Christ himself in his person because Jesus was able to fulfill the law and provide us with the effect of this fulfillment.\n\nThe Evangelical theologian Douglas J. Moo argues that \"the law of Christ\" is strongly connected to the Mosaic Law, for example that nine of the Ten Commandments are included.\n\nGeorge R. Law argues that the New Covenant is the Law of Christ, and that the details are expressed in the Sermon on the Mount.\n\n\n"

The name NOOMA comes from a phonetic spelling of the Greek word (pneuma), meaning \"wind\", \"spirit\", or \"breath\". The video series consists of 24 videos created from 2002-2009 featuring Christian teacher Rob Bell.\n\nEach film is about 10 to 14 minutes of Christian teaching related to real-life situations. Each short story covers a specific topic, usually by relating various experiences from a Christian perspective. Each NOOMA video features the teaching of former Mars Hill Bible Church teaching pastor Rob Bell. The NOOMA videos are subtitled in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Mandarin and Korean.\n\nThe executive director of Flannel, the producer of NOOMA, announced in 2009 plans to feature additional Christian teachers in future NOOMA films.\n\nMost NOOMAs featuring are shot on location in Western Michigan or the Chicago area. However, NOOMAs \"Today | 017\" and \"Name | 018\" were both filmed in the Jacksonville, Florida area. The Amway Grand Plaza Hotel is prominent in \"Trees\". A restaurant called The Rainbow Grill in Grandville, Michigan was used for \"Sunday\". The Gerald R. Ford International Airport is featured in \"Luggage\". The Van Andel Arena is featured in \"Bullhorn\". A beach along Lake Michigan is featured in \"Kickball\". \"Breathe\" is shot in the Lake station on the Red Line in downtown Chicago. \"Open\" was filmed at the new Metro Health Hospital in Wyoming, Michigan three months before the hospital opened its doors. \"Shells\" was filmed primarily at the Pew Campus of Grand Valley State University with several shots of Rob Bell sitting in the Steelcase Library.\n\nOriginally, the non-profit company Fringe began making the NOOMA films in September 2001. The first film in the series was titled \"Rain\", and made in collaboration with co-writer, director Adam Stielstra and producer Brett Van Til. Fringe later changed its name to Flannel and is located in Grandville, Michigan. Since November 2002, Flannel has distributed the films through their website, NOOMA.com. A soundtrack featuring music from the first ten films (plus \"Flowers\" from 013) became available in December 2005 through NOOMA.com and digital music outlets.\n\nIn March 2005, Zondervan started distributing the series, making it available to retail markets. The entire look of the NOOMA series changed when Zondervan began distributing the films. Previously, the first 10 NOOMAs had been available as DVDs in clear and light blue plastic packaging. New packaging which accompanied the re-release of 001\u2013010 and all subsequent episodes features a paper case and a 32-page discussion book. The books feature Scripture, stills from the film, questions related to the film's topic, and a single fun fact for each episode, usually about some production aspect of the film.\n\nAn app is also available to watch the NOOMA videos for both iOS and Android, developed in 2011 by the Christian media publishing company Zondervan.\n\nNOOMA premiered in November 2002. The last film was published July 2009. Twenty-four different films have been created, each with a different theme:\n\n\nMusic from the first ten NOOMA videos were released the soundtrack \"NOOMA Soundtrack | Volume 001\" in December 2005. It features Brie Stoner and David Vandervelde, both independent artists that are not employed by NOOMA.\n\nThe later NOOMA videos feature music that is not on the soundtrack:\n"

    "text": "With Six You Get Eggroll is a 1968 American romantic comedy film directed by Howard Morris and starring Doris Day, Brian Keith, Barbara Hershey, George Carlin, and Pat Carroll. It was the first film that was produced by the CBS Television Network's film unit, Cinema Center Films, and Day's final film performance.\n\nAbby McClure (Doris Day) is a widow with three sons who runs the lumberyard that her husband owned. Her matchmaking sister Maxine (Pat Carroll) tricks her into calling widower Jake Iverson (Brian Keith) and inviting him to the business dinner party Abby is having that night. Not interested in the trouble his sexy, adultery-minded neighbor Cleo (Elaine Devry) is trying to get him into, Jake arrives at Abby's and is bored by all of the matchmaking dialogue. Jake makes up an excuse to leave, but later runs into Abby at an all-night supermarket. Embarrassed by being caught in a fib, Jake meets Abby at a local drive-in run by the wise-cracking Herbie (George Carlin) and the two stay out until 2 a.m. A romance develops, much to the chagrin of Jake's teenage daughter Stacey (Barbara Hershey) and Abby's three sons, Flip, Mitch and Jason (John Findlater, Jimmy Bracken, and Richard Steele). The children make certain that neither Jake nor Abby can be comfortable at the other's home, so the pair wind up more than once at the drive-in, before finally falling in love. Fed up with the situation, they elope, not telling their children that they have married until the next day when the children discover them in bed together.\n\nFrom then on, Abby's sons fight with Iverson's possessive daughter Stacey; while Flip and Stacey both are hostile to the idea of a step-parent; and even Abby's sheepdog and Jake's poodle are incompatible. Neither's house is large enough for the family of six (not including Abby's live-in maid Molly Alice Ghostley), so they borrow a camper and use it as a bedroom while they move into Abby's house and eventually put Jake's up for sale.\n\nThe morning after a bedtime argument, Abby drives off in the camper in a rage; Jake is dumped out clad only in boxers and clutching a teddy bear. After running through the neighborhood, he gets Herbie to lend him some clothes and drive him back to his house. Once Abby discovers what has happened, she returns only to find Jake gone. She is joined by a band of hippies she meets when she reaches the drive-in. When the camper collides with a livestock truck carrying chickens, Abby and the hippies are arrested. Hearing of the accident, Jake and the children rush to her rescue, colliding with the same chicken truck. The angry driver assaults Jake and the children (and pets) unite in his defense. At the station-house the parents and children are joyfully reconciled, and the family finally buys a huge two-story house big enough for a family of six, a maid, and two dogs.\n\nThe title of the movie comes from a scene where the family goes out for Chinese food, and one of the kids notices that because they are a large group, they get something extra: \"With six you get eggroll!\"\n\n\n\nIt was the first film made by the newly formed Cinema Center Films, a subdivision of CBS network.\n\nThe cast includes several actors in small parts (some uncredited) who are much better known for other performances, such as Jamie Farr, William Christopher, Ken Osmond, Allan Melvin, Jackie Joseph, Milton Frome, Vic Tayback, George Carlin, Peter Leeds, Howard Morris, Maudie Prickett and Creed Bratton (part of the singing group The Grass Roots). Many of them (as well as Day herself, in \"The Doris Day Show\") later turned up in TV sitcoms: Farr and Christopher in \"M*A*S*H\", Tayback and Melvin in \"Alice\", Carlin in \"The George Carlin Show\" and Bratton in \"The Office\". (Keith was starring in \"Family Affair\" at the time, while Osmond had played the iconic Eddie Haskell in \"Leave It to Beaver\".)\n\nThe film was released only four months after United Artists' \"Yours, Mine and Ours\". While both films have the same premise\u2014that of a widow and a widower marrying each other and creating a blended family\u2014the United Artists film was based on a true story and was a huge commercial success (if not critical) becoming the 11th highest-grossing film of the year.\n\nAlthough there are similarities between this film, \"Yours, Mine and Ours\" and the later ABC television show \"The Brady Bunch\" that premiered in 1969, the original pilot script for \"The Brady Bunch\" predated the scripts for both of these films.\n\nMost of the film's exterior locations were within a five-mile radius of each other:\n\nThe location used for Herbie Fleck's \"Ye Olde Drive Inn\" was a drive-in on Ventura Place, near CBS Studio Center around the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The site is now a sporting goods store.\n\nSchool scenes were filmed at Ulysses S. Grant High School in Valley Village (at the time Van Nuys), California.\n\nBoth of the houses seen in the film are within a block of each other in the suburb of Toluca Lake, which straddles the borders of Los Angeles and Burbank in the San Fernando Valley. The neighborhood that Abby drives the camper truck through is the northern part of Toluca Lake, specifically Kling Street between Arcola Avenue and Cahuenga Avenue.\n\nThe exterior shots for Abby McClure's late-1930s Tudor Revival home were filmed at 4248 Clybourn Avenue; the same house number is also used in the film. The interiors are soundstage sets that bear no resemblance to the house's actual interior. A studio replica of the street-facing fa\u00e7ade was also used for some night shots\u2014discernible by the differences in the tree in the front yard\u2014specifically for the scene with rain. A still photograph of the house across the street (4245 Clybourn Avenue) can be seen earlier in the same sequence where Jake arrives on the porch of the McClure house. The homes to the right have all had major remodelings, as well as the McClure house, which is almost unrecognizable as the same house today. However, the fire hydrant at the sidewalk, the covered driveway and the front yard tree all remain as of October 2013.\n\nThe exterior shots for Jake Iverson's 1929 Mission Revival home were shot at 10011 Tikita Place. All of the exterior night shots were filmed at this location. The interiors\u2014as well as the backyard\u2014are also soundstage sets that bear no resemblance to the house's actual interior and backyard. The house to the left of the Iverson house has undergone major remodeling, whereas the Iverson house still looked very similar to its appearance in this film until about 2014. As of September 2015, the Iverson house was completely demolished and replaced with a faux-traditional home.\n\nThe film's final punchline\u2014a large two-story early-1950s Colonial house shown briefly at the end with a \"Sold\" sign on it and a front pathway flanked by the McClures' sheepdog and the Iversons' poodle\u2014is also in Toluca Lake, at 10463 Kling Street.\n\nThe late 1930s two-story Colonial house with the circle driveway that the police chase drives through is at 10501 Kling Street (to the immediate left of the above-mentioned Iverson-McClure house at 10463 Kling).\n\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by CBS Television and Columbia Records staff arranger/composer Robert Mersey.\nWhile Day provided a vocal performance either onscreen, in voice-over or over the credits in all of her movies since 1958's \"The Tunnel of Love\", this is one of only three films not to feature a vocal by Day (the others being 1967's \"The Ballad of Josie\" and 1968's \"Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?\"). A male chorus is heard singing an easy-listening piece called \"You Make Me Think About You\" in one sequence, but no vocals are heard by Day. A 45RPM single featuring a vocal by Johnny Mathis and arranged and conducted by Robert Mersey was released by Columbia Records. The single peaked at 35 on \"Billboard\"s Easy Listening Chart.\n\nAfter its release, the film went on to gross $10,095,200 at the box office according to \"Variety\" and the box office website The Numbers, making it one of the top ten moneymaking films of Day's 39-film career.\n\n\"Variety\" said it earned $4.5 million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada.\n\nUpon its theatrical release, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"The latest chapter in the continuing adventures of the Widow Day\u2026 was produced by Cinema Center Films, a subsidiary of the Columbia Broadcasting System\u2026 I kept wondering how the characters played by Miss Day lose their husbands. Cancer? Suicide? Auto accident? There's never any hint. There are, however, some hints of the very real comic talent that has, over the years, become hermetically sealed inside a lacquered personality.\"\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Video on May 3, 2005 as a Region 1 DVD, in widescreen format.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Bobby (1973 film)",
    "text": "Bobby is a 1973 Indian musical romance film, produced and directed by Raj Kapoor, and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas. The film stars Raj Kapoor's son, Rishi Kapoor, in his first leading role, opposite Dimple Kapadia in her debut role.\n\nThe film became a blockbuster, the top-grossing Indian hit of 1973, the second-top-grossing hit of the 1970s at the Indian box office, and one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films of all time (when adjusted for inflation). It also became an overseas blockbuster in the Soviet Union, where it drew an audience of 62.6 million viewers, making it one of the top 20 biggest box office hits of all time in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe film became a trend-setter. It was wildly popular and widely imitated. It introduced to Bollywood the genre of teenage romance with a rich-versus-poor clash as a backdrop. Numerous films in the following years and decades were inspired by this plot. \"Indiatimes Movies\" ranks \"Bobby\" amongst the 'Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films'.\n\nThe story is about the love between two Bombay teenagers of different classes\u2014Raj Nath (Rishi Kapoor), the son of a rich Hindu businessman Mr. Nath (played by Pran), and Bobby Braganza (Dimple Kapadia), the daughter of a poor Goan Christian fisherman Jack Braganza (played by Prem Nath).\n\nRaj returns from his boarding school. Upon his return, his parents throw a party to celebrate his birthday. His governess as a child Mrs. Braganza comes to wish him with her granddaughter Bobby, whom Raj notices among the crowds attending his party. Mrs. Nath (played by Sonia Sahni) ignores Mrs. Braganza, which leads her to leave the party with her granddaughter in a rush.\n\nRaj opens his gifts the next day and finds Mrs. Braganza's gift, so he decides to go and meet her. Reaching there, her granddaughter Bobby opens the door for him, and it is love at first sight for him. During that visit, he mixes his book with Bobby's, so he goes to meet her at the library to exchange the books, and from that, both start their friendship. Raj and Bobby decide to go to see a movie but find out it is a full house. Then Raj gets an idea to go to a party. At the party, Bobby sees Raj talking to Nima (played by Aruna Irani) privately and thinks he is in love with her. As the story progresses, Raj realises that his relationship with the daughter of a poor fisherman is not taken kindly by his eccentric father. Upon Raj's insistence, Mr. Nath invites Jack Braganza to initiate talks of Raj and Bobby's wedding. But instead, Mr. Nath insults him and accuses Jack of using his daughter's beauty and charm to trap Raj for his money. He later offers Jack cash to stop Bobby from seeing Raj. Jack feels highly humiliated by this accusation and reciprocates by insulting Mr. Nath. Their talk enters a deadlock and spells doom for Raj and Bobby's tender love.\n\nMr. Nath engages Raj to a mentally challenged wealthy girl, Alka (Farida Jalal), to establish business ties with her rich father. But Raj runs away from home in order to unite with Bobby. They run away together. Mr. Nath advertises a reward for anyone who can help find his son. Prem Chopra (Prem Chopra) decides that he wants the money, and he and his goons kidnap Raj and Bobby. When they try to escape, Prem starts beating Raj. Mr. Nath and the police come to help, and they find Jack already there attempting to help Raj. Raj and Bobby run away from their fathers and jump over a waterfall. Mr. Nath and Jack jump into the water after them. Mr. Nath rescues Bobby, while Jack rescues Raj.\n\nThey realise that they love their children very much and don't want to stand in the way of their happiness. They accept each other's kids as their own and give their blessings to the union.\n\n\nRaj Kapoor launched his second son Rishi Kapoor in this film; he wanted a new heroine to complement the young love story. Dimple Kapadia and Neetu Singh were auditioned for the role of Bobby Braganza, but Dimple was finally selected.\n\nIn an interview in 2012, Rishi Kapoor stated, \"There was a misconception that the film was made to launch me as an actor. The film was actually made to pay the debts of \"Mera Naam Joker\". Dad wanted to make a teenage love story and he did not have money to cast Rajesh Khanna in the film\".\n\nSome scenes were shot in Gulmarg. One scene was shot in a hut in Gulmarg, which became famous as the 'Bobby Hut'. A few scenes towards the end of the movie were shot on Pune-Solapur highway near Loni Kalbhor where Raj Kapoor owned a farm.\n\nThe film's music was composed by the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo.The lyrics were written by Anand Bakshi, Inderjeet Singh Tulsi, and Vithalbhai Patel. Lyrics penned by Anand Bakshi except where noted.\nIn India, \"Bobby\" was the highest-grossing film of 1973, earning 11 crore. It was also the second-highest-grossing film at the Indian box office in the 1970s, second only to \"Sholay\" (1975). Adjusted for inflation, it grossed 398 crore in 2011 value, equivalent to in 2016 value. As of 2011, it is one of the top 20 highest-grossing films of all time in India.\n\nOverseas, \"Bobby\" was very successful in the Soviet Union when it released there in 1975, due to Raj Kapoor's popularity in the country. \"Bobby\" drew 62.6million admissions at the Soviet box office, making it the second-best-selling film on the Soviet box office charts in 1975, the most popular Indian film of the 1970s, the second-biggest foreign film of the decade, the sixth-biggest box office hit of the decade, the second-most-viewed Indian film of all time (after Raj Kapoor's \"Awaara\"), the sixth-biggest foreign hit of all time, and one of the top 20 biggest box office hits of all time. The film's success launched Rishi Kapoor into an overnight movie star in the Soviet Union, much like \"Awaara\" had done for his father Raj Kapoor.\n\n\"The Illustrated Weekly of India\" wrote upon release that despite a new style, \"the story formula remains the same as ever\". The review further noted that in spite of some gimmicks, the film's commercial appeal may be attributed to the \"two fresh-faced, delightful youngsters\", later praising the performances, including the lead pair who \"act with natural ease and freshness\", Premnath who is \"outstanding as the expansive, volatile Mr. Braganza\", but accused Pran of being typecast.\n\n\n\nIn his 2017 autobiography \"Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored\", Rishi Kapoor revealed that he paid someone to win him an award for Best Actor.\n\n\n"

    "text": "Epirubicin is an anthracycline drug used for chemotherapy. It can be used in combination with other medications to treat breast cancer in patients who have had surgery to remove the tumor. It is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Ellence in the US and Pharmorubicin or Epirubicin Ebewe elsewhere. \n\nSimilarly to other anthracyclines, epirubicin acts by intercalating DNA strands.\nIntercalation results in complex formation which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It also triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. Binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins may be involved in the compound's cytotoxic effects. Epirubicin also generates free radicals that cause cell and DNA damage.\n\nEpirubicin is favoured over doxorubicin, the most popular anthracycline, in some chemotherapy regimens as it appears to cause fewer side-effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4' carbon of the sugar - it has the opposite chirality - which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas. \n\nThe first trial of epirubicin in humans was published in 1980. Upjohn applied for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in node-positive breast cancer in 1984, but was turned down because of lack of data. In 1999 Pharmacia (who had by then merged with Upjohn) received FDA approval for the use of epirubicin as a component of adjuvant therapy in node-positive patients. \n\nPatent protection for epirubicin expired in August 2007.\n"

He is best remembered as the founder and long-time director of the Wiener Library.\n\nWiener trained as an Arabist and spent the years 1909 \u2013 1911 in the Middle East. He fought in the First World War, winning the Iron Cross 2nd Class. From 1919, he was a high-ranking official in the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb\u00fcrger j\u00fcdischen Glaubens (Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish Faith, CV), and identified the Nazi Party as the chief danger to the Jews of Germany and to German society as a whole as early as 1925. Wiener's first wife, Margarethe, died shortly after being released from Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on the way to Switzerland in 1945. In 1953, he married Lotte Philips. Wiener became a naturalized British citizen in the late 1940s.\n\nIn 1928, Wiener was instrumental in creating the B\u00fcro Wilhelmstrasse of the CV, which documented Nazi activities and issued anti-Nazi materials until 1933 when Hitler came to power.

    "title": "Oxyliquit",
    "text": "An Oxyliquit, also called liquid air explosive or liquid oxygen explosive, is an explosive material which is a mixture of liquid oxygen (LOX) with a suitable fuel, such as carbon (as lampblack), or an organic chemical (e.g. a mixture of soot and naphthalene), wood meal, or aluminium powder or sponge. It is a class of Sprengel explosives.\n\nOxyliquits have numerous advantages. They are inexpensive to make, can be initiated by a safety fuse, and in case of a misfire, the oxygen evaporates quickly, rendering the charge quite safe in a short period of time. The first large scale deployment took place in 1899 during the building of the Simplon Tunnel, in the form of cartridges filled with diatomaceous earth soaked with petroleum, or an absorbent cork charcoal, dipped in liquid oxygen immediately before use. In another modification, the cartridge is filled with liquid oxygen after placement in the borehole. \n\nOne of the disadvantages of oxyliquits is that, once mixed, they are sensitive to sparks, shock, and heat, in addition to reported cases of spontaneous ignition. The power relative to weight is high, but the density is low, so the brisance is low as well. Ignition by a fuse alone is sometimes unreliable. The charge should be detonated within 5 minutes of soaking, but even after 15 minutes it may be capable of exploding, even though weaker and with production of carbon dioxide. \n\nAn oxyliquit explosive can be made accidentally by spilling liquid oxygen on tarmac during filling high-altitude airplane systems. The pavement then can become sufficiently explosive to be initiated by walking on it, although the oxygen evaporates shortly after spilling.\n\nAt first, liquid air, self-enriched by standing (nitrogen has a lower boiling point and evaporates preferentially) was used, but pure liquid oxygen gives better results.\n\nA mixture of lampblack and liquid oxygen was measured to have detonation velocity of 3,000\u00a0m/s, and 4 to 12% more strength than dynamite. However, the flame it makes has too long duration to be safe in possible presence of explosive gases, so oxyliquits found their use mostly in open quarries and strip mining. \nThe explosive properties of these mixtures were discovered in Germany in 1895 by Prof. Carl von Linde, a developer of a successful machine for liquefaction of gases, who named them oxyliquits.\n\nIn 1930, over 3 million pounds of liquid oxygen were used for this purpose in Germany alone, and additional 201,466\u00a0lb (91,383\u00a0kg) were consumed by British quarries. The accident rate was lower than with conventional explosives. However, the Dewar flasks the LOX was stored in occasionally exploded, which was caused by iron impurities in the activated carbon serving as trace gas absorbent in the insulation vacuum layer in the flask, which caused spontaneous ignition in case of LOX leak into the enclosed space.\n\nUse of oxyliquits during World War II was low, as there was a plentiful supply of nitrates obtained from synthetic ammonia.\n\nDue to the complicated machinery required for manufacture of liquid oxygen, oxyliquit explosives were used mostly only where their consumption was high. In the United States, some such locations were the strip mines in coal mining areas of the Midwest. Its consumption peaked in 1953 with 10,190 tons, but then decreased to zero in 1968, when it was entirely replaced with the cheaper ANFO.\n\nOxyliquit explosive was prepared \"ad hoc\" from sugar and liquid oxygen from an oxygen bottle to blast a hole in a collapsed cave in Stanis\u0142aw Lem's 1951 novel \"The Astronauts\". The same device was used in Andy Weir's novel \"The Martian\" and the movie adaptation to cause the intentional depressurization of a spaceship by blasting the airlock door.\n\n"

    "title": "Terry Fields",
    "text": "Terence Fields (8 March 1937 \u2013 28 June 2008) was a British politician and firefighter. A member of the Militant group, he was the Labour Member of Parliament for Liverpool Broadgreen from 1983 to 1992. He was expelled from the Labour Party in 1991 with the rest of Militant. Earlier he had been on the executive of the Fire Brigades Union.\n\nFields was born in Bootle, north of Liverpool, the son of a dockworker. Educated at the Major Street County Secondary School and at De La Salle Grammar School in Liverpool, Fields then spent two years on National Service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, an experience that he later claimed had radicalised him. Despite eye problems (which caused him to wear dark glasses), he became a fireman and later a Fire Brigades Union activist.\n\nFields joined the Labour Party in 1968. He was active in the Fire Brigades Union's national 1977\u201378 strike and shortly afterwards he joined the Militant group. At the Labour Party's special conference in 1980 on the question of how to elect the Labour leader, Fields spoke before Denis Healey and said: \"We need coordinated action by the whole of our class to get the Tories out, and the democracy that is being pumped out in the capitalist press is their democracy, not ours. We will found a new democracy when we have created a socialist state in this country. ... To the weak-hearted, the traitors and cowards I say: 'Get out of our movement. There is no place for you. Cross the House of Commons.'\"\n\nFields was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Liverpool Broadgreen for the general election in 1983. In line with Militant policy, he promised during his campaign that, if he was elected, he would be \"a workers' MP on a worker's wage\", a promise he kept by drawing only the equivalent of a fireman's wages and donating the balance of his MP's salary to trade union causes and, according to Doris Heffer, \"to the party causes or, frankly, also to the coffers of Militant Tendency.\" Fields gained the friendship of other Labour MPs, including Doris Heffer's husband, Eric.\n\nFields made his maiden speech on 24 June 1983. His interventions in Parliament focused on issues unique to Liverpool as well as Central America, unemployment, and the coalmining and maritime transport industries.\n\nOn 11 July 1991, Fields was jailed for refusing to pay his poll tax bill of \u00a3373. In defence of the court's decision, Labour leader Neil Kinnock said: \"Law makers must not be law breakers. I have always made that clear.\" Fields's sentence was for 60 days, meaning that he retained his seat in the House of Commons, as MPs automatically lose their seat if they are imprisoned for more than a year. Labour Party members criticised Fields for his militant approach to the poll tax and his failure to support other Labour candidates, in particular Peter Kilfoyle in a by-election for the neighbouring constituency of Liverpool Walton, following Eric Heffer's death.\n\nFields was expelled from the Labour Party in December 1991 along with other members of Militant, including Dave Nellist, then the only other MP who was a member of the tendency.\n\nAt the 1992 general election, Fields stood as an independent, winning 14% of the vote, while the official Labour Party candidate, Jane Kennedy, was elected. After losing his seat, Fields ran The Mayflower, a pub on Fazakerley Street in Liverpool, for six months. He did not join the Socialist Party, into which Militant eventually developed.\n\nIn 2002, at the age of 65, he returned briefly to the limelight after entering a burning house to rescue a woman trapped inside.\n\nFields died at his family home in Netherton on Saturday 28 June 2008, of lung cancer. Bob Wareing, a Liverpool Labour MP for 25 years, said at the time: \"Even though we might disagree on the methods used by Militant Tendency, we in Liverpool could not but respect the sincerity and principled behaviour of Terry Fields.\" A memorial meeting for Fields, held shortly after his death, attracted 200 people.\n\n\n"

    "title": "(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66",
    "text": "\"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66\" is a popular rhythm and blues standard, composed in 1946 by American songwriter Bobby Troup. The song uses a twelve-bar blues arrangement and the lyrics follow the path of U.S. Route 66 (US\u00a066), which traversed the western two-thirds of the U.S. from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California.\n\nNat King Cole, with the King Cole Trio, first recorded the song the same year, and it became a hit, appearing on \"Billboard\" magazine's R&B and pop charts.\n\nAnother version to reach the Billboard charts was that recorded by Bing Crosby with the Andrews Sisters on May 11, 1946, and this reached the No. 14 position in 1946. The song was subsequently recorded by many artists, including Chuck Berry, Glenn Frey, the Rolling Stones, Them, Dr. Feelgood, Asleep at the Wheel, the Manhattan Transfer, Depeche Mode, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Pappo, The Cramps, John Mayer, George Benson and Peter Tork & Shoe Suede Blues.\n\nBobby Troup got the idea for the song on a cross-country drive from Pennsylvania to California. Troup wanted to try his hand as a Hollywood songwriter, so he and his wife, Cynthia, packed up their 1941 Buick and headed west. The trip began on US\u00a040 and continued along US\u00a066 to the California coast. Troup initially considered writing a tune about US\u00a040, but Cynthia suggested the title \"Get Your Kicks on Route 66\". The song was composed on the ten-day journey and completed by referring to maps when the couple arrived in Los Angeles.\n\nThe lyrics read as a mini-travelogue about the major stops along the route, listing several cities and towns through which Route 66 passes: St. Louis; Joplin, Missouri; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Gallup, New Mexico; Flagstaff, Arizona; Winona, Arizona; Kingman, Arizona; Barstow, California; and San Bernardino, California. Winona is the only town out of sequence: it was a very small settlement east of Flagstaff and might indeed have been forgotten if not for the lyric \"Don't forget Winona\", written to rhyme with \"Flagstaff, Arizona\". Many artists who have covered the tune over the years have changed the initial lyrics, usually to \"It goes to St. Louis, down through Missouri...\" then continuing with Oklahoma City and so on. Of the eight states through which the actual route passes, only Kansas and its cities\u2014US\u00a066 spends just inside the state's southeast corner\u2014are not mentioned by the song. Chuck Berry famously mispronounces Barstow to rhyme with \"cow\" instead of correctly pronouncing it to rhyme with \"go\".\n\n\"Route 66\" was first recorded in 1946 by Nat King Cole, whose rendition became a hit on both the U.S. R&B and pop record charts. Cole later re-recorded the tune in 1956 (for the album \"After Midnight\") and 1961 (\"The Nat King Cole Story\").\n\nThe song has become a standard and has been recorded by numerous artists. The version recorded by Perry Como in 1959 (on the album \"Como Swings\") is more lyrically complete, including the seldom-heard second verse and also the introductory verse. Chuck Berry's version, featured in his 1961 album \"New Juke Box Hits\", was closest to its R&B roots, with jazz overtones, often blended into his own songs. \n"

    "title": "Mark Wallace (cricketer)",
    "text": "Mark Alexander Wallace (born 19 November 1981, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, Wales) is a former Welsh cricketer; a left-handed batsman and wicket-keeper.\n\nWallace made his second XI debut for Glamorgan at the age of just 15, and by 1998 he was in the England U-19 team that played Pakistan, as well as accompanying them to New Zealand the following winter and playing three one-day games against Australia U-19s in the summer of 1999, a year in which he won the NBC Denis Compton Award.\n\nIn September 1999, he made his bow in first-class cricket, appearing in the County Championship game against Somerset at the age of 17 years and 287 days \u2013 thus making him Glamorgan's youngest ever Championship wicket-keeper. Wallace took five catches in the match, and scored 28 from number nine in the first innings, and this was enough for him to keep his county place for the rest of the season. In an innings victory over Yorkshire, he made his first half-century: 64 not out, again batting at number nine.\n\nAfter appearing in the U-19 World Cup in the winter, Wallace played no first-team county cricket for the first half of the season, concentrating on his A-Levels, but in August was appointed captain of the U-19s for a one-day series against Sri Lanka, though was unable to take up his appointment because of an injury to his hand. He did, however, recover in time to replace the (also injured) Adrian Shaw for Glamorgan near the end of the season.\n\nAfter another U-19 tour, this time to India, Wallace established himself during the 2001 season as his county's first-choice wicket-keeper, and was selected to visit Australia with the ECB National Academy squad, an honour he repeated the following winter. 2002 saw him make his maiden first-class century when he hit an unbeaten 106 in Glamorgan's pipe-opener against Derbyshire, albeit in a losing cause. Wallace finished 2002 with 61 dismissals in first-class and 27 in List A games, the latter helping his side to the Norwich Union League title.\n\nThe 2003 summer brought Wallace both his county cap and his greatest success with the bat, as he hit 856 first-class runs at 29.51 including 117 against Durham in August and 121 against the same opponents a month later; on the second occasion, Wallace opened the batting.\n\nWallace has continued to be Glamorgan's first choice wicket-keeper in all forms of the game and captained the county for the first time against Somerset at Taunton on 30 August 2007. In 2008 Wallace was named the clubs one-day player of the year and supporters player of the year with his most memorable performance being a match winning score of 48 off just 17 balls against Leicestershire in the Pro40 competition at Colwyn Bay.\n\nIn 2011 Wallace became the first Glamorgan wicket-keeper to ever score a thousand first-class runs in a season surpassing Jimmy Stone's record aggregate set in 1923 along the way.\n\nWallace is considered as Glamorgan's finest ever wicket-keeper/ batsman. He holds the record for the most first-class centuries by a Glamorgan wicket-keeper (15) with his highest score of 139 coming in the final game of the 2009 season against Surrey at the Oval. Wallace has 2 List A centuries coming in the 2012 and 2013 seasons.\n\nHaving previously held the position of vice-captain he was appointed Glamorgan captain for the 2012 season.\n\nHaving previously served as a players representative Wallace was elected as Chairman of the Professional Cricketers Association in 2013.\n\n2008\n\nDuring 2008, Wallace played a handful of matches for Port Talbot Town in the South Wales Cricket Association when his Glamorgan commitments permitted, although he did not keep wicket in these games. This saw him link up again with former county colleagues Ian Thomas and Dan Cherry. He marked his debut in fine style making a match winning century at Llanelli, bringing up three figures with a six which also sealed a nine wicket victory. Another noted performance was his innings of 84 against a Pontarddulais side which included his county teammate James Harris. In all, Wallace played four matches scoring 204 runs at an average of 68.33.\n\n2009\n\nThe left-hander continued his association with The New Mansel side into the 2009 season. After the disappointment of being dismissed by his Glamorgan colleague Robert Croft (en route to a match winning spell of 7/19 for Pontarddulais on 16 May), the first of three eye catching performances came at Ammanford on 20 June with an innings of 93 from only 75 balls. On 25 July, Wallace scored 116 from 126 balls with 14 fours and 3 sixes against Llangennech, an innings which was instrumental in Port Talbot's 109 runs victory. Another match winning performance followed at The Gnoll on 15 August where Wallace smashed 88 from only 59 balls to engineer an eight wicket success against Neath. By the season's end he had scored 382 runs in six innings at an average of 63.66 and an even more impressive strike rate of 111.04.\n\n2010\n\nFollowing Port Talbot's qualification to the inaugural South Wales Premier League, it was announced that Wallace and pace bowler Chris Ashling were to be assigned as the club's two county players for the 2010 season.\n\nOn 17 July, Wallace made a club record score of 216 not out against Swansea at The New Mansel in the South Wales Premier League. Batting at number 3, he faced just 145 balls and hit 16 fours and 13 sixes as Port Talbot rattled up their highest ever team score of 363/2 from their 50 overs. Mark shared in an unbroken third wicket partnership of 323 with former Glamorgan colleague and club captain Dan Cherry who scored 115 not out. The partnership, a record for any wicket for Port Talbot, was made from just 223 balls in 129 minutes. Wallace's 216 not out, as well as being his own career best score, was the highest made for Port Talbot Town in any competitive match surpassing the 208 by Alan Bushnell in a second team match against Hendy in 1991 and also Cherry's own 179 not out in a first team match at Dafen in 2006. Port Talbot went on to secure a winning draw in the match as Swansea replied with 238/7.\n\nAt Ynysygerwn on 14 August, Wallace again gave a remarkable exhibition of hitting by scoring 105 from only 58 balls. The innings included seven fours and eight sixes and helped secure an eight wicket win for Port Talbot. In only 5 innings, Wallace finished the campaign with an astonishing 388 runs at an average of 97 with the strike rate an even more remarkable 136.61.\n\n2011\n\nAfter scoring 68 in an opening day victory at Cardiff on 30 April, Wallace was once again in belligerent form against Ammanford on 14 May at The New Mansel making an unbeaten 103 from 89 balls in a nine wicket win. During the innings, Wallace shared in an unbroken second wicket stand of 155 with Glamorgan colleague Chris Cooke.\n\nHis remarkable run of form continued with an unbeaten 61 from 42 balls at Ynysygerwn and 71 at Mumbles, giving him an astonishing tally of 624 runs from his last six innings at an average of 208. This sequence was finally ended when he was dismissed for only 1 against Newport on 23 July. Wallace was subsequently named Port Talbot Town 1st team player of the season having recorded a total of 304 runs in 5 appearances at an average of 101.33.\n\n2012\n\nDuring the close season it was announced that Mark had been appointed as captain of Glamorgan succeeding Alviro Petersen. He was again chosen as one of Port Talbot's two county players for the 2012 season along with all rounder Alex Jones.\n\n\"as of 9 November 2012\"\n\nHe graduated from Staffordshire University with a degree in Professional Sports Writing and Broadcasting in the summer of 2008 and is currently studying for a master's degree at UWIC. He has written regularly on cricket and rugby in the Welsh press\n\n"

    "title": "Judge Doom",
    "text": "Judge Doom is the main antagonist in the 1988 motion picture \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", portrayed by Christopher Lloyd. He is depicted as a much feared, cruel and nefarious judge of Toontown who is revealed to be both an evil toon mastermind and the one responsible for the framing of the titular character and the killing of Eddie Valiant's brother within the film.\n\nJudge Doom is an original character from the script of the film created by screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. Many actors were considered for the role of the character such as Tim Curry and Christopher Lee.\n\nThe reviews of Christopher Lloyd's role as Judge Doom were mostly positive. Judge Doom was ranked as one of the greatest film villains of all time by \"Wizard\" magazine and WhatCulture. Also the character and his plot twist reveal as a toon is placed as one of the scariest childhood moments, being ranked along characters like Large Marge from \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" and the Child Catcher from \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\".\n\nJudge Doom also appeared in video games, a graphic novel and a few merchandising items based on the film.\n\nWhen \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" first introduces Judge Doom, Lt. Santino confides to Eddie Valiant that Doom bought the election. Doom threatens himself as executioner to Roger Rabbit once he catches him with a new invention he created that combines a chemical vat of turpentine, acetone and benzene (paint thinners) he dubs \"The Dip\". Doom shows off his invention by killing an animated anthropomorphic shoe in front of Eddie. Roger realizes he's in trouble with Doom after him, and begs Eddie to hide him. Later, at the Terminal Bar, Doom uses the \"Shave and a Haircut\" trick to lure Roger out, then prepares to execute him. After a brief scuffle inside the bar, the Judge orders the weasels to capture Roger and Eddie Valiant. When Eddie learns that studio head R.K. Maroon is connected to the plot to frame Roger, Eddie interrogates him, but Maroon pleads that he is \"a dead man\" if he confesses. Just as Maroon is about to spill everything, he is killed by an unseen gunman who nearly shoots Eddie as well.\n\nUpon chasing the killer to Toontown, Eddie catches Jessica Rabbit, thinking she's the murderer, but Jessica reveals that Judge Doom was the one who killed Acme and Maroon. At the film's climax, Doom traps Eddie, Jessica, and Roger in the Acme Factory to explain his scheme: Erase Toontown from the map using a giant, mobile vat of dip linked to a high-pressure water cannon, and then build a freeway over it. Doom then plans to retire from being a judge and control all the profits from the new road system. Doom also reveals that he is the sole shareholder of the Cloverleaf corporation, and confesses that he bought the trolley car company for the sole purpose of putting it out of production. He then orders Jessica and Roger to be tied up and raised into the air via skyhook to be sprayed by the dip cannon.\n\nValiant distracts the weasels using hilarious antics to make them laugh themselves to death, then attempts to rescue Roger and Jessica when he is interrupted by Doom. The two men then square off, dueling with various ACME props. During the fight, Judge Doom is run over by a steamroller, but does not die as expected. As the steamroller crushes him, Doom's body is flattened into a flimsy paper-thin shape, revealing himself to be a Toon wearing an assortment of fake props such as fake eyeballs, false teeth and a rubber mask in order to disguise his Toon body. When Doom shows his red toon eyes and talks in a high squeaky voice, Eddie recognizes Doom as the bank robber in Toontown long ago who murdered his brother, Teddy Valiant, thus explaining how Doom managed to buy the judicial election and the trolley car company.\n\nDoom sprouts a cartoon anvil and an extendable toon buzzsaw from his hand, attempting to finish off Eddie. In the end, Eddie proves to be too clever for the evil Toon, dissolving him by using his own dip concoction against him and leaving behind his human disguise. A crowd of various Toons then surround his empty suit and wonder what kind of Toon he was. It hasn't been revealed what type of Toon he was, or if he was one specific type of Toon at all. The Toons seem to agree that they don't need to know, and decide to live happily ever after when the will of Marvin Acme suddenly appears in Roger's possession, granting full ownership to the citizens of Toontown.\n\nJudge Doom appears as a final boss in the 1988 video game adaption, the 1989 video game adaption, and the 1991 video game adaption of the film.\n\nIn the graphic novel \"\", it is explained that Doom was originally, a toon named Baron von Rotten, who took up the role of playing the antagonist in movies, until an accident in which Von Rotten suffers a concussion, and awakens believing he is a real villain. Von Rotten thus begins his crime career, robbing the First National Bank of Toontown, then killing Theodore 'Teddy' Valiant by dropping a piano on his head, and spreading the stolen money all over the town in order to buy the election for Judge of Toon Town, assuming the new name of Judge Doom.\n\nIn \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (as depicted by Christopher Lloyd) he is the much-feared Judge of Toontown. Despite presiding over a city of Toons, Doom is totally without mirth and passes capital punishment on Toons who break the law, placing them in a chemical vat of turpentine, acetone and benzene which he dubs \"The Dip\". The Judge employs Toon henchmen (the \"Toon Patrol\") to assist him in hunting down Roger Rabbit for the murder of Marvin Acme.\n\nDoom wears a black ensemble which includes a caped overcoat (which is always being blown by a gust of wind), a fedora, gloves and rimless yellow-tinted glasses; he also carries a pocketwatch, as well as a cane which is revealed to be a saber in disguise, for use in emergency situations.\n\nDuring the writing process, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but they made their final decision with newly created character Judge Doom. Price and Seaman based the scheme of Judge Doom of destroying Toontown for a freeway by a planned unproduced sequel of \"Chinatown\" entitled \"Cloverleaf\" which would be the name of Judge Doom's company in the film. Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small animated kangaroos that act as a jury, by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut. Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi's mother.\n\nTim Curry originally auditioned for the role of Judge Doom, but after his audition, the producers found him too terrifying for the role. Christopher Lee was also considered for the role, but turned it down. Several other actors were also considered for the role of Judge Doom, including John Cleese, Roddy McDowall, Eddie Deezen, and Sting.\n\nChristopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Robert Zemeckis and Amblin Entertainment on \"Back to the Future\" in his most famous role as Emmett Brown. Lloyd compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in \"\", both being overly evil characters which he considered being \"fun to play\". Lloyd avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to perfectly portray the character.\n\nLJN released film merchandise of the character with the pet vulture that was scrapped during production. Doom and Eddie Valiant were both playable characters in the action board game Who Framed Roger Rabbit: Dip Flip by LJN. In the game one player plays Judge Doom to dip as many toons as they can while another player plays Eddie Valiant trying to save the toons. A Funko action figure of Judge Doom with his animated eyes along with him holding the anthropomorphic shoe that he dips in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was released by Walt Disney Company as part of the Roger Rabbit lineup.\n\nFilm director Robert Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of \"the dip\", intended to eliminate all toons, to Hitler's Final Solution. While a fictional character, Judge Doom's scheme is ultimately based on the development of the existing Southern California freeways. The film is set in 1947 where Judge Doom plans to destroy Toontown over building a freeway and buy off the Pacific Electric railway to dismantle it. According to him it will boost automotive businesses which indeed it did in real life. This scheme has been cited as a metaphor behind the history of automobiles and the economy of the technological age by various authors such as James Howard Kunstler in the book \"The Geography of Nowhere\".\n\nChristopher Lloyd received praise for his portrayal of Doom by film critics. \n\nThe film's plot twist of him being revealed as a toon was usually ranked as the scariest of scenes for \"kids films\". It is usually ranked along with characters such as Large Marge from \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" and the Child Catcher from \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\". His reveal as a toon character was placed as one of the most traumatizing reveals for kids from the 1980s by \"BuzzFeed\". While \"Rolling Stone\" placed it as one of the top twelve of scariest moments in a \"kids\" film. Neal Justin of the \"Star Tribune\" described Judge Doom as making Freddy Krueger \"look like Fred Rogers\". YouTuber \"Nostalgia Critic\" placed this scene reveal as number three of his \"Top 11 Scariest Nostalgic Moments\".\n\nChristopher Lloyd responded to the character he played:\n\nJudge Doom's demise is often referenced as an allusion to the death of the Wicked Witch of the West in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nRappers MC Lars and Kool Keith wrote a song about Roger Rabbit and Judge Doom on Lars's 2015 album, \"the Zombie Dinosaur LP\" called \"the Dip\".\n"

    "title": "Joel Rifkin",
    "text": "Joel David Rifkin (born January 20, 1959) is an American serial killer who was sentenced to 203 years in prison for the murders of nine women between 1989 and 1993. He is believed to have killed up to seventeen victims between 1989 and 1993 in New York City and on Long Island, New York. Although Rifkin often picked up sex workers in Brooklyn and Manhattan, he lived in North Bellmore, a suburban hamlet on Long Island.\n\nJoel Rifkin's birth parents were both young college students, his biological father an army veteran. On February 14, 1959, when he was three weeks old, Rifkin was adopted by an upper-middle class Long Island couple. His adoptive father, Bernard Rifkin, was of Russian Jewish descent and his adoptive mother, Jeanne (Granelles), of Spanish descent, converted to Judaism when she married.\n\nRifkin performed poorly in school due to learning disabilities and was unpopular with classmates due to his poor social skills. He graduated from East Meadow High School in 1977, then attended classes at Nassau Community College and State University of New York's Brockport and Farmingdale campuses, but left before earning a degree. After leaving college, Rifkin became self-employed as a landscaper.\n\nOn February 20, 1987, his father Bernard died by suicide, overdosing after suffering from prostate cancer for several months.\n\nOn August 22, 1987, Rifkin was arrested during a sex worker sting in Hempstead, New York, after offering an undercover female police officer money for sex.\n\nRifkin committed his first murder in 1989, killing Heidi Balch in his home in East Meadow. He then dismembered her body, removing her teeth and fingertips, putting her head in a paint can and then leaving the paint can in the woods of a golf course in Hopewell, New Jersey, her legs farther north, then dumping her remaining torso and arms into the East River around New York City. On March 5, 1989, Balch's severed head was discovered on the seventh hole of the golf course. On April 8, 1989, Balch's legs were found in Pequonnock Creek near Jefferson Township, New Jersey. A blood test just a few weeks later revealed the presence of the AIDS virus. Balch's remains were not identified until 2013.\n\nOver the next four years, it is presumed Rifkin killed sixteen more women. After his arrest in 1993, he was implicated in Balch's murder. In 2013, investigators determined that Balch and the woman he described as his first victim were the same person.\n\nOn June 24, 1993, Rifkin picked up Tiffany Bresciani, a sex worker who was working on Allen Street in Manhattan. Tiffany was with her boyfriend, punk rock musician Dave Rubinstein at the time and told Rubinstein that she would return in 20 minutes. After she failed to return, Rubinstein called the police with a description of the 1984 Mazda pickup truck driven by Rifkin.\n\nOn June 28, 1993, two troopers with the New York State Police were patrolling Long Island's Southern State Parkway when they noticed the pickup truck. A low speed (topped out at 35 MPH) chase ensued, which turned into a high speed chase (up to 90 MPH) that ended when Rifkin crashed into a utility pole in Mineola, directly in front of the courthouse where he later stood trial. Troopers arrested Rifkin and after detecting a foul odor stemming from the back of the truck, found Bresciani's decaying body under a tarp.\n\nDuring his trial, Rifkin was represented by attorney John Lawrence. He was found guilty of nine counts of second-degree murder in 1994, and sentenced to 203 years up to life in prison.\n\nIn early 1994, it was reported that Rifkin had engaged in a jailhouse scuffle with mass murderer Colin Ferguson. The brawl began when Ferguson asked Rifkin to be quiet while the former was using a prison phone. The \"Daily News\" reported the fight escalated after Ferguson told Rifkin, \"I killed six devils and you only killed women,\" to which Rifkin responded, \"Yeah, but I had more victims.\" Ferguson then punched Rifkin.\n\nPrison officials decided in 1996 that Rifkin was so notorious that his presence in the general prison population could be disruptive. He was confined to his cell at the Attica Correctional Facility for twenty-three hours a day. He spent more than four years in solitary confinement before being transferred to the Clinton Correctional Facility in Clinton County. Rifkin sued, arguing that his solitary imprisonment was unconstitutional. In 2000, a state appellate court determined that prison officials had not violated his constitutional rights by housing him in isolation. His lawsuit sought $50,000 for each of his 1,540 days in solitary confinement (totaling $77 million). Corrections officials say that Rifkin is now imprisoned with more than 200 other inmates at Clinton who are not allowed into the general prison population.\n\n\n\n"

    "title": "Quantifier elimination",
    "text": "Quantifier elimination is a concept of simplification used in mathematical logic, model theory, and theoretical computer science. Informally, a quantified statement \"formula_1 such that formula_2\" can be viewed as a question \"When is there an formula_3 such that formula_2?\", and the statement without quantifiers can be viewed as the answer to that question.\n\nOne way of classifying formulas is by the amount of quantification. Formulas with less depth of quantifier alternation are thought of as being simpler, with the quantifier-free formulas as the simplest.\nA theory has quantifier elimination if for every formula formula_5, there exists another formula formula_6 without quantifiers that is equivalent to it (modulo this theory).\n\nAn example from high school mathematics says that a single-variable quadratic polynomial has a real root if and only if its discriminant is non-negative:\nHere the sentence on the left-hand side involves a quantifier formula_8, while the equivalent sentence on the right does not.\n\nExamples of theories that have been shown decidable using quantifier elimination are Presburger arithmetic, algebraically closed fields, real closed fields, atomless Boolean algebras, term algebras, dense linear orders, abelian groups, random graphs, as well as many of their combinations such as Boolean algebra with Presburger arithmetic, and term algebras with queues.\n\nQuantifier eliminator for the theory of the real numbers as an ordered additive group is \"Fourier\u2013Motzkin elimination\"; for the theory of the field of real numbers it is the \"Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem\".\n\nQuantifier elimination can also be used to show that \"combining\" decidable theories leads to new decidable theories.\n\nIf a theory has quantifier elimination, then a specific question can be addressed: Is there a method of determining formula_6 for each formula_5? If there is such a method we call it a quantifier elimination algorithm. If there is such an algorithm, then decidability for the theory reduces to deciding the truth of the quantifier-free sentences. Quantifier-free sentences have no variables, so their validity in a given theory can often be computed, which enables the use of quantifier elimination algorithms to decide validity of sentences.\n\nVarious model-theoretic ideas are related to quantifier elimination, and there are various equivalent conditions.\n\nEvery first-order theory with quantifier elimination is model complete. Conversely, a model-complete theory, whose theory of universal consequences has the amalgamation property, has quantifier elimination.\n\nThe models of the theory of the universal consequences of a theory formula_11 are precisely the substructures of the models of formula_11. The theory of linear orders does not have quantifier elimination. However the theory of its universal consequences has the amalgamation property.\n\nTo show constructively that a theory has quantifier elimination, it suffices to show that we can eliminate an existential quantifier applied to a conjunction of literals, that is, show that each formula of the form:\n\nwhere each formula_14 is a literal, is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula. Indeed, suppose we know how to eliminate quantifiers from conjunctions of literals, then if formula_15 is a quantifier-free formula, we can write it in disjunctive normal form\n\nand use the fact that\n\nis equivalent to\n\nFinally, to eliminate a universal quantifier\n\nwhere formula_15 is quantifier-free, we transform \nformula_21 into disjunctive normal form, and use the fact that formula_19\nis equivalent to formula_23\n\nIn early model theory, quantifier elimination was used to demonstrate that various theories possess properties like decidability and completeness. A common technique was to show first that a theory admits elimination of quantifiers and thereafter prove decidability or completeness by considering only the quantifier-free formulas. This technique can be used to show that Presburger arithmetic is decidable.\n\nTheories could be decidable yet not admit quantifier elimination. Strictly speaking, the theory of the additive natural numbers did not admit quantifier elimination, but it was an expansion of the additive natural numbers that was shown to be decidable. Whenever a theory in a countable language is decidable, it is possible to extend its language with countably many relations to ensure that it admits quantifier elimination (for example, one can introduce a relation symbol for each formula).\n\nExample: Nullstellensatz for algebraically closed fields and for differentially closed fields.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Uvs Lake",
    "text": "Uvs Lake (; , Ubsu-Nur lake) is a highly saline lake in an endorheic basin - Uvs Nuur Basin in Mongolia with a small part in Russia. It is the largest lake in Mongolia by surface area, covering 3,350\u00a0km\u00b2 at 759\u00a0m above sea level. \nThe northeastern tip of the lake is situated in the Tuva Republic of the Russian Federation. The largest settlement near the lake is Ulaangom. This shallow and very saline body of water is a remainder of a huge saline sea which covered a much larger area several thousand years ago.\n\nThe name Uvs Nuur (sometimes spelled Ubsa Nor or Ubsunur) derives from \"subsen\", a Mongolian word referring to the bitter dregs left behind in the making of airag (Mongolian milk wine), and \"nuur\", the Mongolian word for lake. The name is a reference to the lake's salty, undrinkable water.\n\nUvs Lake has a length of 84\u00a0km and a width of 79\u00a0km, with an average depth of 6\u00a0m. Its basin is separated from the rest of the Great Lakes Depression by the Khan Kh\u00f6khii ridge; however, it is not a rift lake as some mistakenly think.\n\nThe main feeding rivers are the Baruunturuun, Nariin gol, and Tes (primary feed of the lake) from Khangai Mountains in the east, and the Kharkhiraa River and Sangil gol from the Altai Mountains in the west.\n\nThe very large catchment area with no exit results in highly saline water (18.8\u00a0ppt, one half as salty as the oceans), primarily due to sulphate and sodium ions.\n\nThe lake freezes over from October to May. In summer, it exhibits a temperature gradient from 25\u00a0\u00b0C at the surface to 19\u00a0\u00b0C at the bottom.\n\n29 different species of fish are known from Uvs Lake, and one of them, the Potanini altai osman (\"Oreoleuciscus potanini\"),\nis suitable for human consumption.\n\nAll of the lake and many parts of its surroundings have been declared protected sites. The UNESCO is using the designation \"Uvs Lake site\" as an umbrella term to summarize twelve separate clusters of protected sites, each a representative of a major eastern Eurasian biome. \n\nThe Uvs Lake is the terminal basin for the Uvs Lake Basin, which covers an area of 70,000\u00a0km\u00b2 and represents one of the best-preserved natural steppe landscapes of Eurasia. The border between Mongolia and Russia runs through the northern periphery of the basin. Here the world's most northern desert meets the world's most southern tundra zone. Apart from the Uvs Lake, the basin comprises several smaller lakes. As these lakes lie to the north of other inland seas of Central Asia, they are of key importance for waterfowl migration. \n\nSince the basin spans the geoclimatic boundary between Siberia and Central Asia, temperatures may vary from \u221258\u00a0\u00b0C in winter to 47\u00a0\u00b0C in summer. Despite its harsh climate, the depression is home to 173\u00a0bird species and 41\u00a0mammal species, including the globally endangered snow leopard, argali, and Asiatic ibex. The population density is low here. The lack of industry and the reliance of the inhabitants on traditional ways such as nomadic pasturing have little impact on the landscape and allow the ecosystem to remain relatively pristine.\n\nIn 2003, the UNESCO listed the Uvs Lake Basin as a natural World Heritage Site. It was nominated as \"one of the largest intact watersheds in Central Asia where 40,000 archeological sites can be found from historically famous nomadic tribes such as the Scythians, the Turks and the Huns.\" This transboundary patrimony is one of the largest sites inscribed in the World Heritage List to date.\n\n"

    "title": "Kaiju Booska",
    "text": "Booska is the name of a cute, friendly, human-sized kaiju that looks like a cross between a bucktoothed teddy bear and a giraffe. It was originally an iguana until its owner and mega-genius, Daisuke Tonda, fed it experimental powder called \"kuropara\" meant to grow the creature into a giant dinosaur-like monster that Daisuke could control. Booska himself appeared wearing a \"Boo Crown\" which is made from the element Booskanium, appearing as three golden horns running from front to back down his head. This is the source of all his magical abilities, as well as his intelligence, so if he loses the crown he loses his abilities as well. By using his Boo Crown, Booska can fly, lift up to 100 tons, or even turn invisible, among a number of other powers including shooting lasers and an extendible/retractable tail. The crown itself is temperature-sensitive, so if it warms up his powers and intelligence strengthen, and if it is cooled they weaken. He can also change his size, appearing initially as about a foot tall in Episode 1, but switching between that size and the height of an adult human (1.8 m) weighing 120\u00a0kg. Booska needs to be wearing his Boo Crown for his superpowers to work, and his Boo Crown requires nourishment, especially ramen, in order to function properly. In addition, after a turtle bites his tail in the first episode, Booska becomes terrified of turtles, which his enemies use to their advantage.\n\nBooska has a brother, Chamergon, who Daisuke agrees to create after Booska reveals that he feels lonely. Daisuke plans on using the same kuropara powder that he used to create Booska on a squirrel, though this plan goes awry when a space alien crashes into the reaction. As a result, Chamergon is part squirrel, part space alien, and he can survive without oxygen. Chamergon has superpowers as well, including an ability to shoot lasers from his tail, super-speed, and the ability to shape-shift through use of a walnut. He is originally Booska's nemesis, but he learns to be better with time, eventually turning into a friend (though never quite losing his tricksy habits).\n\nCreated by Eiji Tsuburaya, Booska made his debut in the popular 1966 children's TV series, \"Monster Booska\", produced by Tsuburaya Productions (which had just created \"Ultraman\" months earlier). The last episode features Booksa and Chamergon leaving in a rocket ship for a distant planet, promising their return in 20 years.\n"

    "title": "Ricketts Glen State Park",
    "text": "Ricketts Glen State Park is a Pennsylvania state park on 13,193 acres (5,280\u00a0ha) in Columbia, Luzerne, and Sullivan counties in Pennsylvania in the United States. Ricketts Glen is a National Natural Landmark known for its old-growth forest and 24\u00a0named waterfalls along Kitchen Creek, which flows down the Allegheny Front escarpment from the Allegheny Plateau to the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. The park is near the borough of Benton on Pennsylvania Route 118 and Pennsylvania Route 487, and is in five townships: Sugarloaf in Columbia County, Fairmount and Ross in Luzerne County, and Colley and Davidson in Sullivan County.\n\nRicketts Glen's land was once home to Native Americans. From 1822 to 1827, a turnpike was built along the course of PA 487 in what is now the park, where two squatters harvested cherry trees to make bed frames from about 1830 to 1860. The park's waterfalls were one of the main attractions for a hotel from 1873 to 1903; the park is named for the hotel's proprietor, R. Bruce Ricketts, who built the trail along the waterfalls. By the 1890s Ricketts owned or controlled over and made his fortune clearcutting almost all of that land, including much of what is now the park; however he preserved about of virgin forest in the creek's three glens. The sawmill was at the village of Ricketts, which was mostly north of the park. After his death in 1918, Ricketts' heirs began selling land to the state for Pennsylvania State Game Lands.\n\nPlans to make Ricketts Glen a national park in the 1930s were ended by budget issues and the Second World War; Pennsylvania began purchasing the land in 1942 and fully opened Ricketts Glen State Park in 1944. The Benton Air Force Station, a Cold War radar installation in the park, operated from 1951 to 1975 and still serves as airport radar for nearby Wilkes-Barre and as the Red Rock Job Corps Center. Improvements since the creation of the state park include a new dam for the Lake Jean, the breaching of two other dams Ricketts built, trail modifications, and a fire tower. In 1999 Hurricane Floyd briefly closed the park and downed thousands of trees; helicopter logging protected the ecosystem while harvesting lumber worth nearly $7\u00a0million, some of which paid for a new park office in 2001.\n\nThe park offers hiking, ten cabins, camping (one of the two camping areas is on a peninsula in the lake), horseback riding, and hunting. Lake Jean is used for swimming, fishing, canoeing and kayaking. In winter there is cross-country skiing, ice fishing on the lake, and ice climbing on the frozen falls. The Glens Natural Area has eight named waterfalls in Glen Leigh and ten in Ganoga Glen, these come together at Waters Meet; downstream in Ricketts Glen there are four to six named waterfalls. The park has four rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and is home to a wide variety of plants and animals. It was named an Important Bird Area by the Pennsylvania Audubon Society and is an Important Mammal Area too. Ricketts Glen State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of State Parks as one of \"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\".\n\nRicketts Glen State Park is in Pennsylvania, where humans have lived since at least 10000\u00a0BC. The first settlers in the state were Paleo-Indian nomadic hunters known from their stone tools. The hunter-gatherers of the Archaic period, which lasted locally from 7000 to 1000\u00a0BC, used a greater variety of more sophisticated stone artifacts. The Woodland period marked the gradual transition to semi-permanent villages and horticulture, between 1000\u00a0BC and 1500\u00a0AD. Archeological evidence found in the state from this time includes a range of pottery types and styles, burial mounds, pipes, bows and arrows, and ornaments.\n\nThe park is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large longhouses, but their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675\u00a0they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes.\n\nAfter the demise of the Susquehannocks, the lands of the Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who also lived in longhouses, primarily in what is now the state of New York. The Iroquois had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. To fill the void left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the Susquehanna watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).\n\nThe French and Indian War (1754\u20131763) and subsequent colonial expansion encouraged the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania. About 1890 a Native American pot, decorated in the style of \"the peoples of the Susquehanna region\", was found under a rock ledge on Kitchen Creek by Murray Reynolds, for whom a waterfall is named.\n\nRicketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.\n\nA hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.\n\nThe earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in 1842. Dodson also built a dam south of Mud Pond, near what became Lake Jean; both dams were on the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, and each was used to make a \"log splash pond\". The other squatter, named Sickler, also built a mill and log dam, at what became Lake Leigh on the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Sickler was active from 1838 to about 1860.\n\nIn 1865, a well was drilled at the Dodson mill site, after a Mr. Hadley fraudulently added oil to springs in what became the park. Hadley, who had hoped that investors would think petroleum was present, got the Wheeler & Wilson sewing machine company to invest $40,000 ($ in 2020) in his scheme. In the next two years they drilled two wells, one deep at the former Dodson sawmill at Lake Rose and the other deep near the Ricketts mansion. No oil was ever found, and Hadley eventually fled to Canada.\n\nWhile on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850, brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor. In 1851 or 1853 they bought , including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park, as their own hunting preserve, and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855. The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern; it was known as \"Ricketts Folly\" for its isolated location in the wilderness. Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house. The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek.\n\nElijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, for whom the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned , and eventually this grew to more than , including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.\n\nWhile the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction, in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition north of the house. The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875, about southeast of the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873; Ricketts' brother Frank, for whom a park waterfall is named, managed it from then until 1898. Many of the hotel's guests were Ricketts' friends and relations, who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock, later known as the \"Father of Forestry\" in Pennsylvania.\nThe waterfalls and Ganoga Lake were the hotel's biggest attractions. By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall Ganoga Falls; he eventually named 22 of the waterfalls. Ricketts gave most of them Native American names, and named others for relatives and friends. Ricketts renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake in 1881. The name \"Ganoga\" was suggested by Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew; it is an Iroquoian word which Buckalew said meant \"water on the mountain\" in the Seneca language. Donehoo's \"A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania\" identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning \"place of floating oil\" and the name of a Cayuga village in New York. Whatever the meaning, Ricketts also named the glen with the tallest waterfall in the park \"Ganoga\".\n\nRicketts' stone house served as the base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes-Barre's excursions on the mountain; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park. In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club, for anglers on the lake and creek. Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member. In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt Hirlinger and five other men to build the trails along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls. It took them four years to complete the trails and stone steps through the glens.\n\nOne of the highest spots on North Mountain (and in the park today) was an outlook point where Ricketts built a wooden observation tower for his guests. After the first tower collapsed, he built a replacement, and named the site Grand View. From the tower, people could see for .\n\nFor over 20\u00a0years, Ricketts was \"land poor\"; he owed much on the mortgages on his vast land holdings, and there were no good means to transport the estimated of lumber from most of his land to sawmills. Large-scale lumber operations of that time floated logs on major streams or used logging railroads, but neither was available to Ricketts. His small sawmill near the stone house closed by 1875, and he was only able to sell two major tracts of land in his lifetime. In 1872 he sold north of the park to a group of investors that included himself; this deal seems to have been for shares of stock (not cash), and the deed for the sale was not recorded until 1893. Ricketts sold along Bowman Creek, including the easternmost parts of the park, to Albert Lewis in 1876; Lewis hoped to build a branch line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad along the creek. In the 1870s and 1880s, Ricketts tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to find partners and investors who would help him cut the lumber on his land and build a rail line to it.\n\nFinally in 1890, Harry Clay Trexler, J.H. Turrell, Ricketts, and partners formed the Trexler and Turrell Lumber Company and leased of Ricketts' land near Ganoga Lake. The company built a sawmill and lumber town named Ricketts on Mehoopany Creek. The town, which was in both Sullivan and Wyoming counties, had 800\u00a0inhabitants at its peak and extended into the northernmost section of the park. Rail lines were built to the mills at Ricketts, including the Bowman Creek branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad which opened in 1883, and also provided passenger service to the hotel on Lake Ganoga. According to Petrillo's \"Ghost Towns of North Mountain: Ricketts, Mountain Springs, Stull\": \"Ricketts was on the verge of financial disaster for two decades until the Lehigh Valley Railroad was constructed through his lands.\"\nTrexler and Turrell paid Ricketts $50,000 in both 1890 and 1891, and continued to cut his land and pay him for the timber until 1913. By 1911, the main sawmill at Ricketts could cut a day and was supported by three locomotives with 62\u00a0cars on of track. Within the park, the area around what became Lake Jean was cut in the 1890s, and Cherry Ridge (east of Red Rock Job Corps Center) and land around Lake Leigh were the last areas cut by the Ricketts mill. Timber in the east part of the park and along Bowman Creek was cut by Lewis' company, which also used logging railroads and even ran track down the Allegheny Front at Phillips Creek. Lewis' firm built a splash dam on Bowman Creek to help float logs downstream in 1891, then used the lake to cut ice for refrigeration. A second dam and lake were added in 1909 and the icehouses were on state park land; the ice industry supported the small village and post office of Mountain Springs. Ricketts ran his own ice cutting business on Ganoga Lake from 1895 to about 1915.\nWithin a decade of the railroad reaching his lands, Ricketts was out of the hotel business. The North Mountain House hotel was threatened by a forest fire in 1900; the subsequent loss of much of the surrounding old-growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests. Changing tastes may have also played a role in the decline in popularity; the hotel had over 150 guests in August 1878, but only about 70 guests in August 1894. The wooden addition was torn down in 1897 or 1903, and \"despite profits, Ricketts became disenchanted with the hotel business and closed his hotel in 1903\", though the stone house remained the Ricketts family's summer home. Passenger rail service to Ganoga Lake ended when the hotel closed; the fishing club closed that year as well, but was re-formed in 1907. In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the lumber town of Ricketts.\n\nNot all of Ricketts' plans were financially successful; between 1905 and 1907 he built three dams to generate hydroelectric power within what became the park, forming Lake Leigh at the site of Sickler's mill, Lake Rose at the site of Dodson's mill, and Lake Jean (which incorporated the natural Mud Pond) north of these. Lakes Leigh and Jean were named for Ricketts' daughters, while Rose was a Ricketts family name. The Lake Leigh dam was made of concrete and cost $165,000\u00a0(approximately $ in 2020), while the other two dams were log cribs filled with earth and cost a total of $300,000\u00a0(approximately $ in 2020). If the project had been successful, the plan was to rebuild the two log and timber dams in concrete, however, the \"dams were poorly constructed and could not be used for hydroelectric purposes\". After the Panic of 1907, Ricketts wife told him to stop the hydroelectric project before he lost all of their money; this prompted him to say \"I used to be land poor, but now I'm dam poor\".\n\nIn 1913, Ricketts opened the glens and their waterfalls to the public, charging $1\u00a0for parking. Although this fee was unpopular, it remained in place until the land became a state park. After Ricketts died in 1918, the Pennsylvania Game Commission bought from his heirs, via the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company, between 1920 and 1924. This became most of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13, west of the park in Sullivan County. These sales left the Ricketts heirs with over surrounding Ganoga Lake, Lake Jean and the glens area of the park. An area encompassing was approved as a national park site in 1935, and the National Park Service operated a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at \"Ricketts Glynn\" (\"sic\"). The funding to create a National Park at Ricketts Glen was \"sidetracked\" in 1936 when the money was redirected to the Resettlement Administration for \"direct relief\". Similar projects at French Creek, Raccoon Creek, Laurel Hill, Blue Knob, and Hickory Run were also defunded (all are now Pennsylvania state parks). The financial difficulties of the Great Depression and World War II brought an end to this plan for development.\n\nArthur James, the Governor of Pennsylvania, signed legislation creating Ricketts Glen State Park on August 1, 1941. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought , including the glens and their waterfalls, from the heirs for $82,000 on December 31, 1942. The new state park opened to the public on August 1, 1943; however, the park's official history says \"recreational facilities first opened in 1944\". The state bought a total of more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $68,000; the park today has about from the Ricketts family and about acquired from others.\nThe state's original plans for the new park included building an inn, an 18-hole golf course and country club, and a winter sports complex for skiing, ice boating, and tobogganing, as well as a beach with bathing facilities, cabins, and a tent camping area. Only the last three were actually built, all south of Lake Jean; the Hayfield area north of Lake Jean was to have had the facilities for golf and tennis, and the inn and winter sports complex were to have been atop Cherry Ridge, at an elevation of .\n\nA 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000\u00a0visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In the southern end of the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200\u00a0cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).\n\nThe state made other improvements in the park, including replacing or removing all of Ricketts' dams. At Lake Jean it built an earthen dam in 1949\u20131950 to replace Ricketts' 1905 timber dam; the new dam increased the size of Lake Jean to and its eastern end now included the former Mud Pond. On April 20, 1958, the 1907 concrete dam at Lake Leigh developed a hole, causing Pennsylvania State Police to evacuate close to 2,000\u00a0people from the park. Engineers from the state inspected the dam and made a second breach in the dam near ground level, draining the lake. The resulting flow of water destroyed some of the hiking paths in Glen Leigh and the fish stocked in the lake wound up in Kitchen Creek. The Lake Jean dam was repaired in 1956. The last of Ricketts' dams, at Lake Rose, was breached in 1959 after remnants of a hurricane filled the lake to capacity. The rest of the 1905 dam was removed in 1969. At Grand View the state built a wooden fire tower at the site of Ricketts' earlier observation tower, then replaced it with a steel tower. The tower is usually closed to the public, but may be visited if it is staffed by a forest fire warden. From the tower, three states and eleven\u00a0Pennsylvania counties can be seen.\nRicketts Glen State Park was the site of a Cold War era radar station. The Benton Air Force Station in the north of the park at what is now the Red Rock Job Corps Center was constructed during 1950 and 1951. Part of the 648th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron based at Fort Indiantown Gap, the radar station was a \"frontline defender of national security\". About 300\u00a0airmen served at the radar station during the height of the Cold War. Barracks were constructed and recreational facilities for the airmen were provided. In 1963 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began jointly operating the radar station; the 648th Squadron was inactivated in 1975 and the Job Corps center was established in 1978, using the barracks and recreational facilities as the Red Rock Job Corps Center. As of 2010, the radar dome is still fully functional and is used by the FAA as an auxiliary radar to the tower at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport.\n\nOn October 12, 1969, the Glens Natural Area and its waterfalls was named a National Natural Landmark, and it became a Pennsylvania State Park Natural Area in 1993, which guarantees it \"will be protected and maintained in a natural state\". In 1987 the park's ten cabins opened. In 1997 the park was named one of the first\u00a073 Important Bird Areas in the state by the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Audubon Society. That same year heavy rains washed out two bridges on the Falls Trail; because of the difficulty of transporting materials on the trail, an Army National Guard helicopter dropped poles into the glens to rebuild the bridges in early 1997. In the winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in the Ganoga Glen section of the park for the first time. That same year training was undertaken by local fire companies to rescue people injured in the park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them especially treacherous. In 1998 a project to \"repair and improve the Falls Trail\" began, with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize the trail, fix steps, cut down on erosion, and repair some bridges. Originally planned to take four years; it ended up taking six years to complete and cost nearly $1\u00a0million.\nIn September 1999 the remnants of Hurricane Floyd caused massive damage to the park, temporarily closing it and downing thousands of trees. The DCNR hired Carson Helicopters to salvage timber from the downed beech, cherry, maple, and oak trees for $994,000; a crew of 36\u00a0workers spent several months cutting the fallen trees into manageable logs, then helicopters flew the logs to the Hayfield area of the park. The salvage operation ran until the fall of 2001, and yielded of lumber. The operation had revenue of almost $7\u00a0million, and had the ecological advantage of not requiring heavy logging equipment or new roads in the park.\n\nSome of the money from the helicopter logging operation was used for park improvements, including a new $1.7\u00a0million visitor center and park office, which opened in December 2001. In 2002 the park had \"up to a half-million visitors each year\". Beginning in 2003 the campsites in the park, by then over 50\u00a0years old, were refurbished. In 2004 the park and surrounding Pennsylvania State Game Lands were named an Important Mammal Area, and in July the park was featured as a day trip in the Travel section of \"The New York Times\". On June 28, 2006 a 100-year flood caused widespread damage in the park, washing out many of the recently completed improvements to the hiking trails along Kitchen Creek. In 2007 the park was one of the first ten parks to be featured in the Pennsylvania Cable Network's series on the state's park system. Lake Jean was drained starting April 27, 2015 to allow replacement of the 65-year old dam control tower. The repairs were finished October 20, 2015, and the lake was full again by January 3, 2016. The DCNR has named Ricketts Glen one of \"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\", citing its old-growth forest and many waterfalls and its status as a National Natural Landmark.\n\nRicketts Glen State Park covers two different physiographic provinces: the Allegheny Plateau in the north, and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians in the south. The boundary between these is a steep escarpment known as the Allegheny Front, which rises up to above the land to the south. Within the park, Kitchen Creek has its headwaters on the dissected plateau, then drops approximately down the Allegheny Front in . Much of this drop occurs in Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen, two narrow valleys carved by branches of Kitchen Creek, which come together at Waters Meet. Ricketts Glen lies south of and downstream from Waters Meet, and here the terrain becomes less steep. There are 24 named waterfalls in the three glens.\n\nThe rocks exposed in the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370\u00a0and 340\u00a0million years ago, when the land was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel.\nTremendous pressure caused the formation of the sedimentary rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, siltstone, and conglomerates.\n\nThere are four distinct rock formations within Ricketts Glen State Park. The most recent and highest of these is the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation, composed of \"grayish-red shale, siltstone, sandstone, and some conglomerate\". This forms the highest points on the Allegheny Plateau and is found north of Lake Jean, forming the land beneath the Red Rocks Job Corps Center and Cherry Ridge to the east. The next formation below this is the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which is buff or gray sandstone with conglomerate and siltstone inclusions. This forms most of the Allegheny Plateau and underlies the park office, Lake Jean and the former Lakes Rose and Leigh. The boulders of the Midway Crevasse, which the Highland Trail passes through, are Pocono Formation sandstone.\nThe third of the rock formations within the park is the Huntley Mountain Formation, from the late Devonian and early Mississippian. This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale. The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant. It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation, to the south. The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park, and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370\u00a0million years old. The Allegheny Front within the park is named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain, with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487 (PA 487).\n\nGeologists and the official Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend in a series of small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book \"Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers\" uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.\nAbout 300\u00a0to 250\u00a0million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the Alleghenian orogeny. This happened long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. In the years since, up to 5,000\u00a0feet (1,500\u00a0m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.\n\nThe effects of glaciation have made Kitchen Creek within the park \"unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down the Allegheny Front\", as it is the only one with an \"almost continuous series of waterfalls\". Before the last ice age, Kitchen Creek had a much smaller drainage basin; during the ice age, glaciers covered all of the park except the Grand View outcrop. About 20,000\u00a0years ago the glaciers retreated to the northeast and glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. Glacial deposits of debris thick formed a dam blocking water from Ganoga Lake and what became Lake Jean from draining into Big Run, a tributary of Fishing Creek. The water was instead diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek.\n\nThese diversions added about to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin, increasing it by just over 50\u00a0percent. The result was increased water flow in Kitchen Creek, which has been cutting the falls in the glens since. The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin, as Phillips Creek to the east still does. Kitchen Creek is now too steep for its present amount of water flow, and over time erosion will decrease the creek's slope and make it less steep. There are rocks with glacial striations visible within the park.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System, Ricketts Glen State Park is at an elevation of . The two highest points in the park are Cherry Ridge, made of Mauch Chunk Formation rock, at , and the Grand View outcrop of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone, at . The highest elevation waterfall in the park is Mohawk Falls in Ganoga Glen at ; the lowest elevation waterfall is Adams Falls, in Ricketts Glen just south of PA 118, at .\n\nRicketts Glen State Park is on the Allegheny Plateau, which has a continental climate with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges (the difference between the daily high and low) of 20\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C) in winter and 26\u00a0\u00b0F (14\u00a0\u00b0C) in summer. The park is in the Huntington Creek watershed, where the mean annual precipitation is 40\u00a0to 48\u00a0inches (1016\u00a0to 1219\u00a0mm). Weather records for Ricketts Glen State Park show that the highest recorded temperature at the park was in 1988, and the record low was in 1984. On average, January is the coldest month, July is the hottest month, and June is the wettest month.\n\nIt has been estimated that before the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682, up to 90\u00a0percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods: over of eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, and a mix of hardwoods. By 1890, Ricketts' land was the largest tract of old-growth forest remaining in the state, and though he made his fortune clearcutting nearly all his land, the forests in the glens of Ricketts Glen State Park were \"saved from the lumberman's axe through the foresight of the Ricketts family\". The rough terrain of the glens made it difficult to harvest timber from the area. Many of the old-growth trees are believed to be over 500 years old, and ring counts on fallen trees have revealed ages of over 900 years.\n\nThe forests in and around Ricketts Glen State Park are some of the most extensive in northeastern Pennsylvania, and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures. The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum, yellow birch, cinnamon fern, sphagnum and various sedges. The old-growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and oaks, and the park is home to 85\u00a0species of shrubs, woody vines, and trees, including seven kinds of conifers.\n\nThe streams and lakes of Ricketts are fisheries for many fish species, although fishing is prohibited in the glens area. In 2009, of Kitchen Creek downstream from Waters Meet and all of Phillips Creek were classified as Class A Wild Trout Waters, defined by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as \"streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery\".\n\nLake Jean is home to brook trout, brown trout, brown bullhead, and yellow bullhead. Acid rain with a pH near 3.0 has altered the ecology of the lakes and region; in Lake Jean low pH has decreased the number and quality of insects and plankton at the base of the food chain. Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnows, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch. Predators like chain pickerel and largemouth bass are relatively few in number, and adult fish appear to grow rapidly but breed comparatively poorly. Since 1996, the DCNR has added of powdered lime to the lake each year to make the pH more neutral.\n\nA registered National Natural Landmark since 1969, the Glens Natural Area is the main scenic attraction in the park and covers . Among perhaps of old-growth forest, two branches of Kitchen Creek cut through the deep gorges of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh and unite at Waters Meet; then flow through Ricketts Glen. These old trees are commonly up to tall, with diameters of almost . The park has a great variety of trees as it lies at the boundary between the northern and southern types of hardwoods. In 1993, the state designated the Glens Natural Area a State Park Natural Area, which means that it \"will be protected and maintained in a natural state\". No buildings or latrines are allowed in the natural area, and the bridges in it are built with wood, not steel or concrete.\n\nA series of trails parallels the branches of Kitchen Creek as they course down the Glens. Glen Leigh features eight named waterfalls and is south of the former Lake Leigh. Ganoga Glen is southeast of the former Lake Rose and has ten named falls, including the Ganoga Falls, the tallest in the park. The DCNR recognizes three named waterfalls in Ricketts Glen just south of Waters Meet, plus Adams Falls farther downstream at PA 118. Adams Falls, the southernmost and one of the most scenic in the park, is about south of PA 118, via an easy stroll along a trail from the parking lot.\n\nBrown's \"Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers\" recognizes these 22\u00a0named falls plus two more in the park. One is on Shingle Cabin Brook as it enters Kitchen Creek just south of Waters Meet; the other, Kitchen Creek Falls, is directly below the PA 118 highway bridge, which obscures much of the view. There are also several unnamed falls in the park, such as a good-sized unnamed waterfall on a tributary of the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek, or the \"forgotten falls\" on the South Branch Bowman Creek.\n\nThe Falls Trail includes the trails through the glens, plus the Highland Trail, which connects the top ends of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh to form a triangular loop, and passes through the \"Midway Crevasse,\" a crack in Pocono Formation rock. All but two of the named waterfalls are either on the triangular loop or south of it. Hiking the entire Glens area on the Falls Trail loop, beginning and ending at PA 118, covers . A shorter hike involves parking at Lake Rose, near the junction of Ganoga Glen and the Highland Trail.\n\nRicketts Glen State Park was named part of an Important Mammal Area because it \"support[s] critical habitat for a wide range of mammals\"; Pennsylvania has 64 wild mammal species. The park has an extensive forest cover of hemlock-filled valleys and hardwood-covered mountains, which makes it a habitat for big woods wildlife. Animals such as white-tailed deer, black bear, red and gray squirrels, porcupine, and raccoon are seen fairly regularly. Less common creatures include beaver, bobcat, coyote, fisher, mink, muskrat, red fox, and river otter. In addition to mammals, Ricketts Glen is also known for its wild turkeys, wild flowers, butterflies, dragonflies, and the occasional timber rattlesnake.\n\nWhite-tailed deer became locally extinct on Ricketts' land by 1912, mirroring the sharp decline in Pennsylvania's deer population from overhunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The state imported nearly 1,200\u00a0white-tailed deer from Michigan between 1906 and 1925 to re-establish the species throughout Pennsylvania, and Ricketts brought deer to the area of the park in 1914. Pennsylvania's deer population rebounded from roughly one thousand in 1905 to roughly one million in 1928. Deer are now one of the most numerous mammals in the park, and their overbrowsing threatens development of trees and plants there. The deer eat most of the saplings and shrubs before they can reach their full size, which reduces the number of low lying plants many birds use for shelter. The white-tailed deer became the official state animal in 1959. By 2001, deer populations had increased to the point where it was feared that \"Pennsylvania is losing its vegetative diversity from deer over-browsing\".\n\nOther locally extinct mammals in Pennsylvania include bison, grey wolf, lynx, marten, moose, mountain lion, and wolverine. Beaver and river otter have been successfully reintroduced. In 1995 and 1996, 39\u00a0fishers were released in the State Game Lands adjoining the park, and breeding populations appear to have been reestablished. The coyote seems to have come to the state in the 1930s. Black bear and wild turkey populations were also severely affected by overhunting and loss of habitat; the recovery of their populations in the 20th century has been \"aided by the re-growth of the eastern deciduous forest\". Bears prefer a mixed forest of hickory and oak with an understory of shrubs such as blueberry and laurel; they use patches of coniferous forest for cover during the winter months.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Audubon Society has designated all of Ricketts Glen State Park a Pennsylvania Important Bird Area (IBA); an IBA is defined as a globally important habitat for the conservation of bird populations. The state park was originally part of the much larger North Mountain IBA, which encompassed , including all of the park and nearby Pennsylvania State Game Lands Numbers 13, 57, and 66. Ricketts Glen State Park is featured in the Audubon Society's \"Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail Guide\".\n\nOrnithologists and bird watchers have recorded a total of 75\u00a0species at Ricketts Glen State Park and within the North Mountain IBA. Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed: there is a large area of forest in the park, as well as great habitat diversity. The location along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations. The North Mountain IBA was said to be the \"largest extant forest\" in northeastern Pennsylvania and one of the largest forests in the state of Pennsylvania. It was officially adopted by the North Branch Bird Club and was \"well-known\" by members of local Audubon societies and the Pennsylvania Society for Ornithology.\n\nRicketts Glen State Park provides a breeding habitat for four species of flycatchers and two species of waterthrushes. American bittern nest near the park. Bald eagle are frequent visitors to the park, and some ornithologists believe they may be nesting there since adult pairs have been observed with their young. The park is a nesting location for three \"rare\" birds, including two birds of prey (the northern goshawk and northern harrier), and Swainson's thrush, as well as one \"at risk\" duck, the green-winged teal.\n\nRicketts Glen State Park has extensive acreage of \"interior forest\" that is far from open space; several bird species that are area-sensitive are found within these forests in the park, including the black-throated green warbler, red-eyed vireo, dark-eyed junco and black-capped chickadee. Two species of owl, barred and northern saw-whet, inhabit the deep forests. The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush, Acadian flycatcher, Blackburnian warbler, blue-headed vireo, magnolia warbler, brown creeper, golden-crowned kinglet and winter wren. Wood thrush are found in the lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by hermit thrush at the higher elevations. The Canada warbler and black-throated blue warbler are on several watchlists, but are common within the park. The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white-throated sparrow, while the black-throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher. Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion. Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a \"pest\" due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean. Ricketts Glen's forests also support populations of Nashville and yellow-rumped warblers, yellow-bellied sapsucker, red-breasted nuthatch, and purple finch.\n\n of the park are open to hunting and trapping. Common game animals include black bear, gray squirrel, ring-necked pheasant, ruffed grouse, wild turkey, and white-tailed deer. The common fur-bearing animals in Ricketts Glen State Park are beaver, bobcat, coyote, mink, muskrat, and raccoon.\n\nLake Jean is a warm-water fishery that is open to fishing, ice fishing, swimming, and boating. Common game fish include panfish, trout and bass. Boating is permitted on the lake, which has two boat launches. Gasoline-powered boats are prohibited. Canoes and other human-powered boats are permitted, as are sail boats and electric-powered vessels. There is a boat rental concession on the lake, which has canoes, kayaks, row boats, and paddle boats available. No fishing is allowed in the Glens Natural Area.\n\nRicketts Glen State Park has 10\u00a0modern cabins that are available to rent on a year-round basis. All cabins are furnished with electric heat, two or three bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and bath. Cabin renters must bring their own household items such as linens and cookware. One cabin is ADA accessible. There are 120\u00a0campsites at Ricketts Glen State Park. Each campsite has access to washhouses with flush toilets, showers, and laundry tubs. The campsites also have fire rings and picnic tables. There are two camping areas on the shores of Lake Jean, with one of the campgrounds on a peninsula. There is also an organized group tenting area, which can accommodate six groups of up to 40\u00a0persons.\n\nThe beach on Lake Jean is open from mid-May through mid-September. A concession stand and modern restrooms are at the beach. Lifeguards have not been provided since 2008; visitors swim at their own risk. Picnic areas are at Lake Jean and the PA 118 access area at the Falls Loop Trail trailhead. Charcoal grills are provided for use at the picnic areas.\n\nEnvironmental education specialists lead guided tours of parts of the park from March through November. The walks give school groups, scouting organizations, and other visitors a close and informed look at natural wetlands, old-growth forests, waterfalls, flora and fauna, and geologic formations. Other programs are held in the park office, on topics such as safety around wild animals. In summer and fall, park educators lead \"Ghost Town Walks\" to the ruins of the lumber village of Ricketts and to adjoining State Game Lands.\n\nThere are of hiking trails at Ricketts Glen State Park, and a trail loop is open for horseback riding. The trails range from \"easy\" hikes like the Beach Trail along Lake Jean, to \"difficult\" hikes such as the Falls Trail loop, which passes by many of the waterfalls of the park. In 2001, John Young in \"Hike Pennsylvania: An Atlas of Pennsylvania's Greatest Hiking Adventures\" wrote of the Falls Trail: \"This is not only the most magnificent hike in the state, but it ranks up there with the top hikes in the East.\" In 2003, \"Backpacker Magazine\" named the park's Falls Trail loop one of its 30 favorite day hikes in the contiguous United States.\n\nMany of the trails in the park are difficult and hikers are urged to use caution, especially on the Falls Trail, which is steep and often wet and slippery. Each year hikers fall in the glens and have to be rescued, which usually takes dozens of volunteers and up to 11\u00a0hours because of the remote locations and rugged terrain. As of 2008, the former concession stand along PA 118 in the southern end of the park was used for storage of rescue equipment.\n\nThe following state parks are within of Ricketts Glen State Park:\n\n\n"

    "title": "Athletic conference",
    "text": "An athletic conference is a collection of sports teams, playing competitively against each other at the professional, collegiate, or high school level. In many cases conferences are subdivided into smaller divisions, with the best teams competing at successively higher levels. Conferences often, but not always, include teams from a common geographic region.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA) are divided into Eastern (NHL, NBA) and Western (NHL, NBA) Conferences, with multiple divisions within each conference (three in each NBA conference, two in each NHL conference). In both leagues, a total of sixteen teams (eight from each conference) qualify for the league's postseason playoffs. In the NHL, since the 2013\u201314 season, the top 3 in a division are guaranteed to qualify and division winners are awarded the highest seeds, meaning they will have home-ice advantage in a given round. In the NBA, starting with the 2015\u201316 season, the playoff spots go to the eight top teams in each conference by overall record, with home-court advantage in each playoff series based solely on record. Major League Soccer (MLS) also divides itself into an Eastern and Western Conference, though it does not have divisions within them; it too allocates an equal number of teams from each conference to play for its MLS Cup Playoffs (since 2015, this has been six teams each).\n\nThe National Football League (NFL) is divided into an American Football Conference (AFC) and a National Football Conference (NFC). Both conferences have 16 teams, and each conference is divided into 4 divisions of 4 teams each. These conferences, for the most part, derive from the fact that they were once separate organizations: the original National Football League and the 1960s American Football League; the two entities merged in 1970, with each league forming the basis of the NFC and AFC respectively. The NFL allocates six teams from each conference for the NFL playoffs; the four division winners (guaranteed one of the top four seeds, based on winning percentage), and the two best-non division winners, also known as wild cards.\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) does not use the word \"conference.\" Instead, it is divided into two separate leagues which are identical to the conferences listed above in all but name (which, although their operations have been integrated via the Commissioner of Baseball in modern times, were originally separately managed organizations with an intense rivalry). These are the American League (AL) and National League (NL), with 15 teams each. Each league is divided into the Eastern (AL, NL), Central (AL, NL), and Western (AL, NL) divisions, with all six divisions having 5 teams each. Each league produces five teams for postseason play, with each division winner also guaranteed one of the top three seeds, even if their record is lower than the league's top wild card teams.\n\nIn all four sports, the champion of one conference (or league in MLB's case) plays the champion of the other conference for the final round championship, this is guaranteed to occur because the rules for the playoffs require play to be exclusively within the conference/league in all rounds before the final round, leaving only two teams for the finals (one from each conference/league) and the records of teams outside a conference/league are ignored, which can allow teams with inferior records to make the playoffs while teams in the other conference with better records do not get in. An extreme example of this has occurred twice in the NFL, when the 2010 Seattle Seahawks and 2014 Carolina Panthers reached the playoffs by winning their respective divisions despite losing records (7\u20139 for the Seahawks, 7\u20138\u20131 for the Panthers). These are the only two teams ever to qualify for the playoffs with losing records in seasons that were not shortened by strikes. In addition, a team's regular season schedule is weighted towards more games against other teams within their own division and to a lesser extent their own conference; NBA and NHL teams play at least two games (one at each home arena) against every other team in their league in a regular season, but in MLB and the NFL teams do not.\n\nIn college sports, the terms \"league,\" \"conference\" and (generally at lower levels) \"athletic association\" can be used interchangeably to refer to a group of teams (generally eight to twelve colleges and/or universities, occasionally as high as sixteen) that regularly play against each other within a national governing body, the most significant of which is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Most of these groups (including the \"Power Five\" conferences that are primary partners in the College Football Playoff) refer to themselves as conferences, although the Horizon League, Ivy League, Patriot League, Pioneer League and Summit League use the word \"league\" instead, and another conference calls itself the Colonial Athletic Association. The NCAA itself is divided into divisions and subdivisions based on athletic scholarship eligibility, which can lead to redundancy when these conferences also have divisions of their own. For instance, the Southeastern Conference is part of NCAA Division I (specifically the Football Bowl Subdivision), but is itself also subdivided into an East and West division.\n\nIn English association football, the top level of non-League football\u2014i.e., the level below the Premier League and the three tiers that make up the English Football League (EFL)\u2014was known as the Football Conference from the 1986\u201387 season through the end of the 2014\u201315 season. In turn, from 2004, the Conference was divided into three leagues\u2014Conference Premier, at the fifth tier of the English football pyramid, and Conference North and Conference South, which made up the sixth tier. Starting with the 2015\u201316 season, the Football Conference and its component leagues were renamed. The Football Conference and Conference Premier were both renamed \"National League\", and the two regional leagues were renamed National League North and National League South.\n\nThis does not strictly meet the definition indicated in the previous sections of this article, as each individual league mentioned in this section is a separate competition. The only times that teams from different leagues compete against one another in meaningful matches are in knockout cup competitions, such as the FA Cup (open to teams from all levels), the EFL Cup (open only to teams from the Premier League and the English Football League), and the FA Trophy (open only to teams in the broader definition of the National League, plus the two tiers below it).\n\nThe Kontinental Hockey League has a Western Conference and an Eastern Conference. This is similar to the NHL's conferences in North America.\n\nIn rugby union, Super Rugby is the highest level of provincial competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the highest domestic level in Japan, and the only professional domestic level in Argentina. From the creation of Super Rugby in 1996 through 2015, only Australia, New Zealand and South Africa participated; the competition added teams in the latter two countries in 2016. Since the 2011 season, it has operated on a conference system.\n\nFrom 2011 through to 2015, the competition had one conference based in each of its three founding countries. The winner of each conference received a playoff spot, as did the three next best teams overall. With the addition of Argentina's Jaguares and Japan's Sunwolves for 2016, plus a sixth franchise for South Africa, the competition reorganised into a new four-conference system. In 2016 and 2017, Australia and New Zealand formed separate conferences within an Australasian group; the South African teams were joined by the Jaguares and Sunwolves in a \"South African\" group, with that group also being divided into two conferences. The winner of each conference continued to receive a playoff spot, with additional berths going to the next three best Australasian teams and the next best team of the South African group.\n\nFor 2018, Super Rugby will revert to a 15-team format, following the dropping of two teams from South Africa and one from Australia. The new format features three conferences\u2014Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, each with five teams; the Sunwolves will join the Australian conference and the Jaguares will play in the South African conference. The conference winners will continue to receive playoff berths, with additional berths going to the top five teams in the overall competition table that were not already qualified.\n\nIn the same sport, Pro14 adopted a conference system effective in 2017\u201318, following the addition of the two South African teams dropped from Super Rugby. The competition split into two conferences, each featuring two teams from Ireland and Wales, plus single teams from Italy, Scotland and South Africa. Following the league season, the teams that top each conference table will receive berths in the semifinals, with the next two teams in each conference playing off for semifinal berths.\n\nThe now defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, where teams are represented by companies instead of geographical entities, and there are multiple tournaments held sequentially in a season, a conference refers to a single tournament. This has since been carried over by other leagues, such as the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), which has its own conferences, the Philippine Super Liga, the Premier Volleyball League, the PBA D-League, and formerly the Philippine Basketball League.\n\nThe term \"conference\" referring to a single tournament does not apply if there's only one tournament in a season, such as in the case of the college sports leagues, the Philippine Football League, and the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League.\n\n"

The MENA acronym is often used in academia, military planning, disaster relief, media planning as a broadcast region, and business writing.

According to the Oil and Gas Journal (January 1, 2009), the MENA region has 60% of the world's oil reserves () and 45% of the world's natural gas reserves ( ).\n\nAs of 2011, 8 of the 15 OPEC nations are within the MENA region.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center, 40% of the adult population in MENA has completed less than a year of primary school. The fraction is higher for women, of whom half have been to school for less than a year.\n\nIslam is by far the dominant religion in nearly all of the MENA territories; 91.2% of the population is Muslim. The Middle East-North Africa region comprises 20 countries and territories with an estimated Muslim population of 315 million or about 23% of the world's Muslim population. The term \"MENA\" is often defined in part in relation to majority Muslim countries that based on the countries located in the region, although several nations in the region are not majority Muslim-dominated.\n\nDue to rich resources, mainly oil and gas, combined with its location between three continents, (Asia, Africa and Europe), the MENA region has been in conflict since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire; notably due to the creation of Israel, a Jewish state among Arab and Muslim countries; Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict; the Iran\u2013Iraq War; Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia proxy conflict; and the rise of terrorism. Conflict in the region had come to its highest peak so far in the 21st century, with incidents such as the U.S. intervention of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent Iraq War and the rise of ISIS; the Arab Spring, which spread war to throughout the region such as the Syrian Civil War, Libyan Civil War and Yemeni Civil War.\n\nDue to the geographic ambiguity and Eurocentric nature of the term \"Middle East\", some people prefer use other terms like \"WANA\" (West Asia and North Africa) or the less common NAWA (North Africa-West Asia). MENA region remains the most common term and is used by most organizations, academia, and political entities flexibly, including those in the region itself.\n\n\nFrom April 2013, the International Monetary Fund started using a new analytical region called \"MENAP\" (Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan), which adds Afghanistan and Pakistan to MENA countries.\nNow MENAP is a prominent economic grouping in IMF reports.\n\n\nThe term \"MENAT\" (Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey) has been used to include Turkey in the list of \"MENA\" countries.\n\n"

While at Auburn, Mitchell was a four-time All-SEC selection and was named a second-team All-American in his 1977\u201378 season. He also became Auburn's all-time leader in scoring (2,123 points) and rebounding (996), after leaving for the NBA. He remains the all-time leading rebounder and is second in all-time scoring only to Chuck Person. Mitchell's number 30 jersey was retired on January 19, 2013, at the Auburn Arena.\n\nMitchell was drafted with the 15th pick in the first round, of the 1978 NBA Draft, by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He started his NBA career with the Cavaliers but played most of his career for the San Antonio Spurs.

    "title": "Green sea turtle",
    "text": "The green sea turtle (\"Chelonia mydas\"), also known as the green turtle, black (sea) turtle or Pacific green turtle, is a species of large sea turtle of the family Cheloniidae. It is the only species in the genus Chelonia. Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean. The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace, not to the color of its carapace, which is olive to black.\n\nThis sea turtle's dorsoventrally flattened body is covered by a large, teardrop-shaped carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, \"C. mydas\" is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses. The turtles bite off the tips of the blades of seagrass, which keeps the grass healthy.\n\nLike other sea turtles, green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Many islands worldwide are known as Turtle Island due to green sea turtles nesting on their beaches. Females crawl out on beaches, dig nests and lay eggs during the night. Later, hatchlings emerge and scramble into the water. Those that reach maturity may live to 80 years in the wild.\n\n\"C. mydas\" is listed as endangered by the IUCN and CITES and is protected from exploitation in most countries. It is illegal to collect, harm or kill them. In addition, many countries have laws and ordinances to protect nesting areas. However, turtles are still in danger due to human activity. In some countries, turtles and their eggs are hunted for food. Pollution indirectly harms turtles at both population and individual scales, as well as light pollution. Many turtles die after being caught in fishing nets. Also, real estate development often causes habitat loss by eliminating nesting beaches.\n\nThe green sea turtle is a member of the tribe Chelonini. A 1993 study clarified the status of genus \"Chelonia\" with respect to the other marine turtles. The carnivorous \"Eretmochelys\" (hawksbill), \"Caretta\" (loggerhead) and \"Lepidochelys\" (Ridley) were assigned to the tribe Carettini. Herbivorous \"Chelonia\" warranted their status as a genus, while \"Natator\" (flatback) was further removed from the other genera than previously believed.\n\nThe species was originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 as \"Testudo mydas\". In 1868, Marie Firmin Bocourt named a particular species of sea turtle \"Chelonia agassizii\". This \"species\" was referred to as the \"black sea turtle\". Later research determined Bocourt's \"black sea turtle\" was not genetically distinct from \"C. mydas\", and thus taxonomically not a separate species. These two \"species\" were then united as \"Chelonia mydas\" and populations were given subspecies status: \"C. mydas mydas\" referred to the originally described population, while \"C. mydas agassizi\" referred only to the Pacific population known as the Gal\u00e1pagos green turtle. This subdivision was later determined to be invalid and all species members were then designated \"Chelonia mydas\". The oft-mentioned name \"C. agassizi\" remains an invalid junior synonym of \"C. mydas\".\n\nThe species' common name does not derive from any particular green external coloration of the turtle. Its name comes from the greenish color of the turtles' fat, which is only found in a layer between their inner organs and their shell. As a species found worldwide, the green turtle has many local names. In the Hawaiian language it is called \"honu\", and it is locally known as a symbol of good luck and longevity.\n\nIts appearance is that of a typical sea turtle. \"C. mydas\" has a dorsoventrally flattened body, a beaked head at the end of a short neck, and paddle-like arms well-adapted for swimming. Adult green turtles grow to long. The average weight of mature individuals is and the average carapace length is . Exceptional specimens can weigh or even more, with the largest known \"C. mydas\" having weighed and measured in carapace length.\n\nAnatomically, a few characteristics distinguish the green turtle from the other members of its family. Unlike its close relative the hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell. The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes. Underneath, the green turtle has four pairs of inframarginal scutes covering the area between the turtle's plastron and its shell. Mature \"C. mydas\" front appendages have only a single claw (as opposed to the hawksbill two), although a second claw is sometimes prominent in young specimens.\n\nThe carapace of the turtle has various color patterns that change over time. Hatchlings of \"Chelonia mydas\", like those of other marine turtles, have mostly black carapaces and light-colored plastrons. Carapaces of juveniles turn dark brown to olive, while those of mature adults are either entirely brown, spotted or marbled with variegated rays. Underneath, the turtle's plastron is hued yellow. \"C. mydas\" limbs are dark-colored and lined with yellow, and are usually marked with a large dark brown spot in the center of each appendage.\n\nThe range of the green sea turtle extends throughout tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide. The two major subpopulations are the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific subpopulations. Each population is genetically distinct, with its own set of nesting and feeding grounds within the population's known range. One of the genetic differences between the two subpopulations is the type of mitochondrial DNA found in individual's cells. Individuals from rookeries in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea have a similar type of mitochondrial DNA, and individuals from the Pacific and Indian Oceans have another type of Mitochondrial DNA. Their native range includes tropical to subtropical waters along continental coasts and islands between 30\u00b0N and 30\u00b0S. Since green sea turtles are a migrating species, their global distribution spans into the open ocean. The differences in mitochondrial DNA more than likely stems from the populations being isolated from each other by the southern tips of both South America and Africa with no warm waters for the green sea turtles to migrate through. The green sea turtle is estimated to inhabit coastal areas of more than 140 countries, with nesting sites in over 80 countries worldwide throughout the year. In the United States Atlantic coast, green sea turtles can be found from Texas and north to Massachusetts. In the United States Pacific coast, they have been found from southern California north to the southernmost tip of Alaska. The largest populations of green sea turtles within the United States coastline are in the Hawaiian Islands and Florida. Globally, the largest populations of sea turtles are in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Caribbean islands.\n\nThe green sea turtle can generally be found throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Although the species is most abundant in tropical climates, individuals have been spotted as far north as Canada in the western Atlantic, and the British Isles in the east. The subpopulation's southern range is known until past the southern tip of Africa in the east and Argentina in the western Atlantic. The major nesting sites can be found on various islands in the Caribbean, along the eastern shores of the continental United States, the eastern coast of the South American continent and most notably, on isolated North Atlantic islands.\n\nIn the Caribbean, major nesting sites have been identified on Aves Island, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Costa Rica. In recent years there are signs of increased nesting in the Cayman Islands. One of the region's most important nesting grounds is in Tortuguero in Costa Rica. In fact, the majority of the Caribbean region's \"C. mydas\" population hails from a few beaches in Tortuguero. Within United States waters, minor nesting sites have been noted in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and all along the east coast of Florida. Hutchinson Island in particular is a major nesting area in Florida waters. Notable locations in South America include secluded beaches in Suriname and French Guiana. In the Southern Atlantic Ocean, the most notable nesting grounds for \"Chelonia mydas\" are found on the island of Ascension, hosts 6,000\u201313,000 turtle nests.\n\nIn contrast with the sporadic distribution of nesting sites, feeding grounds are much more widely distributed throughout the region. Important feeding grounds in Florida include Indian River Lagoon, the Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Homosassa, Crystal River, and Cedar Key.\n\nIn the Pacific, its range reaches as far north as the southern coast of Alaska and as far south as Chile in the east. The turtle's distribution in the western Pacific reaches north to Japan and southern parts of Russia's Pacific coast, and as far south as the northern tip of New Zealand and a few islands south of Tasmania. The turtles can be found throughout the Indian Ocean.\n\nSignificant nesting grounds are scattered throughout the entire Pacific region, including Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands, the South Pacific, the northern coast of Australia, and Southeast Asia. Major Indian Ocean nesting colonies include India, Pakistan, and other coastal countries. The east coast of the African continent hosts a few nesting grounds, including islands in the waters around Madagascar.\n\nNesting grounds are found all along the Mexican coast. These turtles feed in seagrass pastures in the Gulf of California. Green turtles belonging to the distinct Hawaiian subpopulation nest at the protected French Frigate Shoals some west of the Hawaiian Islands. In the Philippines, green turtles nest in the Turtle Islands along with closely related hawksbill turtles. Indonesia has a few nesting beaches, one in the Meru Betiri National Reserve in East Java. The Coral Sea has nesting areas of world significance. The Great Barrier Reef has two genetically distinct populations; one north and one south. Within the reef, 20 separate locations consisting of small islands and cays were identified as nesting sites for either population of \"C. mydas\". Of these, the most important is on Raine Island.\nMajor nesting sites are common on either side of the Arabian Sea, both in Ash Sharqiyah, Oman, and along the coast of Karachi, Pakistan. Some specific beaches there, such as Hawke's Bay and Sandspit, are common to both \"C. mydas\" and \"L. olivacea\" subpopulation. Sandy beaches along Sindh and Balochistan are nesting sites. Some off the Pakistani coast, Astola island is another nesting beach.\n\nOn 30 December 2007, fishermen using a \"hulbot-hulbot\" (a type of fish net) accidentally caught an , long and wide turtle off Barangay Bolong, Zamboanga City, Philippines. December is breeding season near the Bolong beach.\n\nThe population that has often been known as the Gal\u00e1pagos green turtle have been recorded and observed in the Gal\u00e1pagos as far back as the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much attention has been paid to them due to the overwhelming research done on the Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoises. Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering the behaviors of the Gal\u00e1pagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. At one point the name \"Chelonia agassizii\" was applied to this population as a separate species. Analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15\u00a0nesting beaches. however has demonstrated that there is not only no significant distinction of this population but that it would be paraphyletic to recognise it. As such the species name \"Chelonia agassizzii\" is considered a junior synonym of \"Chelonia mydas\" as such it is considered as a local cariant of the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas.\n\nThe morphological distinctiveness of the Gal\u00e1pagos green turtle has given rise to the debate, but evidence of taxonomic distinctiveness is best served using the combination of multiple datasets. The two most notable morphological distinctions are the considerably smaller adult size and the much darker pigmentation of the carapace, plastron, and extremities. Other distinctions are the curving of the carapace above each hind flipper, the more dome-shaped carapace, and the very long tail of adult males. \nThree possibilities have arisen from their unique characteristics: \"agassizii\" is a separate species from \"C. mydas\", it is a subspecies of green sea turtle, or it is simply a color mutation. These facts have led to the debate over binomial separation however due to the significance of the DNA testing results there have been no distinctions made at this time. At a meeting for sea turtle scientists and their collaborators in 2000, the evidence for the taxonomic position of the Gal\u00e1pagos green turtle was reviewed and a majority among the participants supported treating it as a population or subspecies of the green turtle (instead of a separate species). However, this is possibly a case of political taxonomy.\n\nAs such the three major international checklists that cover turtles of the world Reptile Database the checklist of Fritz and Havas (2007) and the IUCN Checklist (TTWG 2017) all consider this a junior synonym.\n\nGreen sea turtles move across three habitat types, depending on their life stage. They lay eggs on beaches. Mature turtles spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters with lush seagrass beds. Adults frequent inshore bays, lagoons, and shoals with lush seagrass meadows. Entire generations often migrate between one pair of feeding and nesting areas. Green sea turtles, \"Chelonia mydas\", are classified as an aquatic species and are distributed around the globe in warm tropical to subtropical waters. The environmental parameter that limits the distribution of the turtles is ocean temperatures below 7 to 10 degrees Celsius. Within their geographical range, the green sea turtles generally stay near continental and island coastlines. Near the coastlines, the green sea turtles live within shallow bays and protected shores. In these protected shores and bays, the green sea turtle habitats include coral reefs, salt marshes, and nearshore seagrass beds. The coral reefs provide red, brown, and green algae for their diet and give protection from predators and rough storms within the ocean. The salt marshes and seagrass beds contain seaweed and grass vegetation, allowing ample habitat for the sea turtles.\n\nTurtles spend most of their first five years in convergence zones within the bare open ocean that surround them. These young turtles are rarely seen as they swim in deep, pelagic waters. Green sea turtles typically swim at .\n\nAs one of the first sea turtle species studied, much of what is known of sea turtle ecology comes from studies of green turtles. The ecology of \"C. mydas\" changes drastically with each stage of its life history. Newly emerged hatchlings are carnivorous, pelagic organisms, part of the open ocean mininekton. In contrast, immature juveniles and adults are commonly found in seagrass meadows closer inshore as herbivorous grazers.\n\nThe diet of green turtles changes with age. Juveniles are carnivorous, but as they mature they become omnivorous. The young eat fish eggs, molluscs, jellyfish, small invertebrates, worms, sponges, algae, and crustaceans. Green sea turtles have a relatively slow growth rate because of the low nutritional value of their diet. Body fat turns green because of the consumed vegetation. This diet shift has an effect on the green turtle's skull morphology. Their serrated jaw helps them chew algae and sea grasses. Most adult sea turtles are strictly herbivorous.\n\nOnly human beings and the larger sharks feed on \"C. mydas\" adults. Specifically, tiger sharks (\"Galeocerdo cuvier\") hunt adults in Hawaiian waters. Juveniles and new hatchlings have significantly more predators, including crabs, small marine mammals and shorebirds. Additionally, their eggs are vulnerable to predation by scavengers like red foxes and golden jackals.\n\nGreen sea turtles have a variety of parasites including barnacles, leeches, protozoans, cestodes, and nematodes. Barnacles attach to the carapace, and leeches to the flippers and skin of the turtles, causing damage to the soft tissues and leading to blood loss. Protozoans, cestodes and nematodes lead to many turtle deaths because of the infections in the liver and intestinal tract they cause. The greatest disease threat to the turtle population is fibropapilloma, which produces lethal tumor growth on scales, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. Fibropapilloma is caused by a herpesvirus that is transmitted by leeches such as \"Ozobranchus branchiatus\", a species of leech which feeds almost entirely on green sea turtles.\n\nGreen sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding sites and nesting sites; some swim more than to reach their spawning grounds. Beaches in Southeast Asia, India, islands in the western Pacific, and Central America are where Green sea turtles breed. Mature turtles often return to the exact beach from which they hatched. Females usually mate every two to four years. Males, on the other hand, visit the breeding areas every year, attempting to mate. Mating seasons vary between populations. For most \"C. mydas\" in the Caribbean, mating season is from June to September. The French Guiana nesting subpopulation nests from March to June. In the tropics, green turtles nest throughout the year, although some subpopulations prefer particular times of the year. In Pakistan, Indian Ocean turtles nest year-round, but prefer the months of July to December.\n\nSea turtles return to the beaches on which they were born to lay their own eggs. The reason for returning to native beaches may be that it guarantees the turtles an environment that has the necessary components for their nesting to be successful. These include a sandy beach, easy access for the hatchlings to get to the ocean, the right incubation temperatures, and low probability of predators that may feed on their eggs. Over time these turtles have evolved these tendencies to return to an area that has provided reproductive success for many generations. Their ability to return to their birthplace is known as natal homing. The males also return to their birthplaces in order to mate. These males that return to their homes know they will be able to find mates because the females born there also return to breed. By doing this, the green sea turtles are able to improve their reproductive success and is why they are willing to expend the energy to travel thousands of miles across the ocean in order to reproduce.\n\nMating behaviour is similar to other marine turtles. Female turtles control the process. A few populations practice polyandry, although this does not seem to benefit hatchlings. After mating in the water, the female moves above the beach's high tide line, where she digs a hole 11-22 inches in depth with her hind flippers and deposits her eggs. The hole is then covered up again. Clutch size ranges between 85 and 200, depending on the age of the female. This process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. After the nest is completely covered, she returns to the sea. The female will do this 3 to 5 times in one season.\n\nThe eggs are round and white, and about 45\u00a0mm in diameter. The hatchlings remain buried for days until they all emerge together at night. The temperature of the nest determines the sex of the turtles at around the 20-40 day mark. At around 50 to 70 days, the eggs hatch during the night, and the hatchlings instinctively head directly into the water. This is the most dangerous time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators, such as gulls and crabs, feed on them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles. Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle. It is speculated that they take twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild. It is estimated that only 1% of hatchlings reach sexual maturity.\n\nEach year on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, \"C. mydas\" females create 6,000 to 25,000 nests. They are among the largest green turtles in the world; many are more than a metre in length and weigh up to .\n\nSea turtles spend almost all their lives submerged, but must breathe air for the oxygen needed to meet the demands of vigorous activity. With a single explosive exhalation and rapid inhalation, sea turtles can quickly replace the air in their lungs. The lungs permit a rapid exchange of oxygen and prevent gases from being trapped during deep dives. Sea turtle blood can deliver oxygen efficiently to body tissues even at the pressures encountered during diving. During routine activity, green and loggerhead turtles dive for about four to five minutes, and surface to breathe for one to three seconds.\n\nTurtles can rest or sleep underwater for several hours at a time, but submergence time is much shorter while diving for food or to escape predators. Breath-holding ability is affected by activity and stress, which is why turtles quickly drown in shrimp trawlers and other fishing gear. During the night while sleeping and to protect themselves from potential predators, the adults wedge themselves under rocks below the surface and under ledges in reefs and coastal rocks. Many green sea turtles have been observed in returning to the same sleeping location night after night.\n\nGreen sea turtles tend to have good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most sensitive to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no external ear and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700\u00a0Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects to the roof of the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson's organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.\n\nSince green sea turtles migrate long distances during breeding seasons, they have special adaptive systems in order to navigate. In the open ocean, the turtles navigate using wave directions, sun light, and temperatures. The sea turtles also contain an internal magnetic compass. They can detect magnetic information by using magnetic forces acting on the magnetic crystals in their brains. Through these crystals, they can sense the intensity of Earth's magnetic field and are able to make their way back to their nesting grounds or preferred feeding grounds.\n\nNatal homing is an animal's ability to return to its birthplace in order to reproduce. Natal homing is found in all species of sea turtles and in other animals such as salmon. How these turtles are able to return to their birthplace is an interesting phenomenon. Many researchers believe that sea turtles use a process called imprinting, which is a special type of learning that occurs when turtles first hatch that allows them to recognize their native beach. There are two types of imprinting that are thought to be the reason turtles can find these beaches. The first is the chemical imprinting hypothesis. This hypothesis states that much like salmon, sea turtles are able to use olfactory cues and senses to smell their way home. However, a problem with this hypothesis is that some turtles travel thousands of miles to return to their native beaches, and the scents from that area aren't likely to travel and be distinguishable from that distance. \nThe second hypothesis is the geomagnetic. This hypothesis states that as it hatches, a young turtle will imprint on the magnetic field of the beach they are born on. This hypothesis strongly correlates to the method which sea turtles use to navigate the earth.\n\nIn order to tolerate the constant heat loss in the water, sea turtles have the ability to shunt blood away from tissues that are tolerant of low oxygen levels toward the heart, brain, and central nervous system. Other mechanisms include basking on warm beaches and producing heat through their activity and movements of their muscles. In the winter months, turtles living at higher latitudes can hibernate for a short period in the mud.\n\nThe green sea turtles exhibit sex differences by their development and appearance. As adult turtles, males are easily distinguishable from the females by having a longer tail (visibly extending past the shell) and longer claws on the front flippers. The hatching time and sex of the turtles are determined by the incubation temperature of the nest. Hatchings occur more quickly in nests that are warmer than nests that are in cooler conditions. Warm nesting sites above 30 degrees Celsius favor the development of females, whereas nesting sites below 30 degrees Celsius produce males. The position of the egg in the nest also affects sex-determination. Eggs in the center tend to hatch as females due to the warmer conditions within the nest.\n\nGreen sea turtles play an essential role within the ecosystem in which they live. In the seagrass beds, the turtles feed on the seagrass by trimming only the top and leaving the roots of the plant. Through their feeding technique, the turtles help to improve the health and growth of the seagrass beds. The healthy seagrass beds that the turtles provide give habitat and feeding grounds for many species of fish and crustaceans. On the nesting beaches, the green sea turtles provide key nutrients for the ecosystem through their hatched egg shells. In their coral reef habitat, the green sea turtles have a symbiotic interaction with reef fish, including the yellow tang. The yellow tang fish swims along with the turtle and feeds on the algae, barnacles, and parasites on its shell and flippers. This species interaction provides food for the yellow tang and provides a necessary cleaning and smoothing of the turtle's shell. This cleaning helps the turtle swim by reducing the amount of drag and improves their health.\n\nHistorically, the turtles' skin was tanned and used to make handbags, especially in Hawaii. Ancient Chinese considered the flesh of sea turtles a culinary delicacy, including and especially \"C. mydas\". Particularly for this species, the turtle's fat, cartilage, and flesh, known as calipee, are sought as ingredients for making turtle soup, a popular 19th-century American dish.\n\nIn Java, Indonesia, sea turtle eggs were a popular delicacy. However, the turtle's flesh is regarded as \"\u1e25ar\u0101m\" or \"unclean\" under Islamic law (Islam is Java's primary religion). In Bali, turtle meat was a prominent feature at ceremonial and religious feasts. Turtles were harvested in the remotest parts of the Indonesian archipelago. Bali has been importing sea turtles since the 1950s, as its own turtle supplies became depleted. The mostly Hindu Balinese do not eat the eggs, but sell them instead to local Muslims.\n\nCommercial farms, such as the Cayman Turtle Farm in the West Indies, once bred them for commercial sale of turtle meat, turtle oil (rendered from the fat), turtle shell, and turtle leather made from the skin. The farm's initial stock was in large part from \"doomed\" eggs removed from nests threatened by erosion, flooding, or in chemically hostile soil. The farms held as many as 100,000 turtles at any one time. When the international markets were closed by regulations that did not allow even farm-bred turtle products to be exported internationally, the surviving farm became primarily a tourist attraction, supporting 11,000 turtles. Initially started as Mariculture Ltd., then Cayman Turtle Farm Ltd and subsequently branded Boatswain's Beach, in 2010 the farm's brandname was changed to Cayman Turtle Farm: Island Wildlife Encounter.\nSea turtles are integral to the history and culture of the Cayman Islands. When the islands were first discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1503, he named them \"Las Tortugas\" because of the abundance of sea turtles in the waters around the islands. Many of the earliest visitors came to the Cayman Islands to capture the turtles as a source of fresh meat during long voyages. The Green Turtle is a national symbol displayed as part of the Coat of Arms of the Cayman Islands, which also forms part of the national flag of the Cayman Islands. The country's currency uses a turtle as the watermark in its banknotes. A stylised sea turtle nicknamed \"Sir Turtle\" is the mascot of the national airline Cayman Airways and is part of the livery of its aircraft.\n\nA ki'i p\u014dhaku (petroglyph) of a turtle (or honu) can be found on The Big Island of Hawaii in the Pu'u Loa lava fields. The green sea turtle (called Honu) has always held a special meaning for Hawaiians and this petroglyph shows its importance dating to possibly when the islands first became populated. The turtle symbolizes a navigator that can find his way home time after time. This symbol mirrors the real life of the green Hawaiian turtle as it will swim hundreds of miles to lay its eggs at its own place of birth. Though there are other myths as well, some Hawaiian legends say the honu were the first to guide the Polynesians to the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiians revere the turtle and the legend of Kailua, a turtle who could take the form of a girl at will. In human form, she looked after the children playing on Punalu'u beach.\n\nIn recent decades, sea turtles have moved from unrestricted exploitation to global protection, with individual countries providing additional protection, although serious threats remain unabated.\n\nHuman action presents both intentional and unintentional threats to the species' survival. Intentional threats include continued hunting, poaching and egg harvesting. More dangerous are unintentional threats, including boat strikes, fishermen's nets that lack turtle excluder devices, pollution and habitat destruction. Chemical pollution may create tumors; effluent from harbors near nesting sites may create disturbances; and light pollution may disorient hatchlings. Habitat loss usually occurs due to human development of nesting areas. Beach-front construction, land \"reclamation\" and increased tourism are examples of such development. An infectious tumor-causing disease, fibropapillomatosis, is also a problem in some populations. The disease kills a sizeable fraction of those it infects, though some individuals seem to resist the disease. In addition, at least in the Southwestern Atlantic (R\u00edo de la Plata, Uruguay), exotic invasive species such as the rapa whelk Rapana venosa, were reported massively bio-fouling immature green turtles, reducing buoyancy, increasing drag, and causing severe injuries to the carapace. Because of these threats, many populations are in a vulnerable state.\nPacific green turtles' foraging habitats are poorly understood and mostly unknown. These foraging grounds are most likely along the coast of Baja California, Mexico and southern California, in which these turtles have a high risk of incidental capture by coastal fisheries. The main mortality factor for these turtles is the shrimp trawlers in Mexico, in which many of these turtles go undocumented. The only foraging area that has been identified is the San Diego Bay, but it is heavily polluted with metals and PCBs. These contaminants have a negative effect on the ocean environment, and have been shown to cause lesions and sometimes mortality. Green turtles also are threatened by entanglement and ingestion of plastic. In San Diego Bay, an adult green turtle was found dead with monofilament netting tightly packed in its esophagus. In addition there are indications that global climate change is affecting the ability of Green Turtle populations in Australia to produce males due to their temperature-dependent sex determination and the rising temperatures in the northern Great Barrier Reef region.\n\nGreen sea turtles are the most commonly traded species along Java's south coast and are sold in the form of whole, stuffed animals or turtle oil, locally known as \"minyak bulus\"\n\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has repeatedly listed green sea turtles in its Red List under differing criteria. In 1982, they officially classified it as an endangered species. The 1986, 1988, 1990, 1994, and the landmark 1996 edition of the IUCN Red List, retained the listing.\n\nIn 2001, Nicholas Mrosovsky filed a delisting petition, claiming some green turtle populations were large, stable and in some cases, increasing. At the time, the species was listed under the strict EN A1abd criteria. The IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee ruled that visual counts of nesting females could not be considered \"direct observation\" and thus downgraded the species' status to EN A1bd\u2014retaining the turtle's endangered status.\n\nIn 2004, the IUCN reclassified \"C. mydas\" as endangered under the EN A2bd criteria, which essentially states the wild populations face a high risk of extinction because of several factors. These factors include a probable population reduction of more than 50% over the past decade as estimated from abundance indices and by projecting exploitation levels.\n\nOn 3 May 2007, \"C. mydas\" was listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as a member of the family Cheloniidae. The species was originally listed on Appendix II in 1975. The entire family was moved to Appendix I in 1977, with the exception of the Australian population of \"C. mydas\". In 1981, the Australian population joined the rest. It is therefore illegal to import, export, kill, capture or harass green turtles.\n\nThe Mediterranean population is listed as critically endangered. The eastern Pacific, Hawaiian and Southern California subpopulations are designated threatened. Specific Mexican subpopulations are listed as endangered. The Florida population is listed as endangered. The World Wide Fund for Nature has labeled populations in Pakistan as \"rare and declining\".\n\nIn the State of Hawaii, specifically on the Island of Hawaii (Hawaii County), state representative Faye Hanohano, a Native Hawaiian rights activist, pressed for a measure to delist C. mydas from protected status so that Native Hawaiians could legally harvest the turtles and possibly their eggs as well. The bill, HCR14, was largely overlooked by the media since at that point it was only a local issue. While the bill was passed in the House, the Senate's Committee on Energy and Environment refused to hear it, which meant that the bill did not go on to be heard by the Senate.\n\nIn addition to management by global entities such as the IUCN and CITES, specific countries around the world have undertaken conservation efforts.\nBali has traditional uses that were considered \"sustainable\", but have been questioned considering greater demand from the larger and wealthier human population. The harvest was the most intensive in the world. In 1999, Indonesia restricted turtle trade and consumption because of the decreasing population and threat of a tourist boycott. It rejected a request made by Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika in November 2009 to set a quota of 1,000 turtles to be killed in Hindu religious ceremonies. While conservationists respect the need for turtles in rituals, they wanted a smaller quota.\n\nEcotourism is one initiative in Sabah, Malaysia. The island of Pulau Selingan is home to a turtle hatchery. Staff people place some of the eggs laid each night in a hatchery to protect them from predators. Incubation takes around sixty days. When the eggs hatch, tourists assist in the release of the baby turtles into the sea.\n\nAll populations are listed as \"Threatened\". The Hawaiian subpopulation has made a remarkable comeback and is now one focus of ecotourism and has become something of a state mascot. Students of Hawaii Preparatory Academy on the Big Island have tagged thousands of specimens since the early 1990s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the species is protected by a Biodiversity Action Plan, due to excess harvesting and marine pollution. The Pakistani-branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature has been initiating projects for secure turtle hatching since the 1980s. However, the population has continued to decline.\n\nIn the Atlantic, conservation initiatives have centered around Caribbean nesting sites. The Tortuguero nesting beaches in Costa Rica have been the subject of egg-collection limits since the 1950s. The Tortuguero National Park was formally established in 1976, in part, to protect that region's nesting grounds. On Ascension Island, which contains some of the most important nesting beaches, an active conservation program has been implemented. Karumb\u00e9 has been monitoring foraging and developmental areas of juvenile green turtles in Uruguay since 1999.\n\nCayman Turtle Farm located in Grand Cayman in the northwest Caribbean Sea is the first farm to have achieved the second generation of Green Sea turtles bred, laid, hatched, and raised in captivity. Since its beginning in 1968, the farm has released over 31,000 turtles into the wild, and each year more captive-bred turtles are released into the Caribbean Sea from beaches around the island of Grand Cayman. Captive-bred turtles released from the farm as hatchlings or yearlings with \"living tags,\" have now begun to return to nest on Grand Cayman as adults. On February 19, 2012 the farm released the first 2nd-generation captive-bred Green Sea turtle equipped with a Position Tracking Transponder \u2013 PTT (also known as a satellite tag). In addition, the farm provides turtle meat products to the local population for whom turtle has been part of the traditional cuisine for centuries. In so doing, the farm curtails the incentive to take turtles from the wild, which over the years in addition to the Cayman Turtle Farm's release of captive-bred turtles has enabled an increase in the number of turtles sighted in the waters around the island of Grand Cayman and nesting on its beaches.\n\nIn the Pacific, green sea turtles nest on the \"motu\" (islets) in the Funafuti Conservation Area, a marine conservation area covering 33 square kilometers (12.74 square miles) of reef, lagoon and \"motu\" on the western side of Funafuti atoll in Tuvalu.\n\nThe genome of \"Chelonia mydas\" was sequenced in 2013 to examine the development and evolution of the turtle body plan.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Time War (Doctor Who)",
    "text": "The Time War, more specifically called the Last Great Time War, is a conflict within the fictional universe of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". The conflict pitted the Time Lords against the Daleks and culminated in the apparent mutual destruction of both races, caused by the Doctor.\n\nIn the \"Doctor Who\" continuity, the war occurs between the events of the 1996 film and the 2005 revived series. It was frequently mentioned and alluded to from the first series of the show's return, but was not directly seen until the show's 50th anniversary special. The war's events and progression have never been fully explained. Short comments in various episodes act as hints, but the war was not explicitly discussed until the 2007 episode \"The Sound of Drums\"; part two of the two-part special \"The End of Time\" (2009\u20132010) provided further information and revealed the Time Lord leaders' sinister endgame. The closing battles and the climax of the Time War were finally depicted in the 50th anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" which ultimately revealed the Time Lords' fate.\n\nThe Last Great Time War pitted the Time Lords of Gallifrey against the Daleks of Skaro. The specific incident that sparked the conflict remains unclear, but according to executive producer Russell T Davies, the origins dated back to conflicts between the Doctor and the Daleks. In \"Genesis of the Daleks\" (1975), the Time Lords\u2014having foreseen the possibility of the Daleks conquering the universe\u2014send the Fourth Doctor into the past in an attempt to avert the Daleks' creation, affect their development to make them less aggressive, or discover an inherent weakness they could exploit.\n\nIn retaliation for this ultimately unsuccessful mission, the Daleks attempt to infiltrate the High Council of the Time Lords with duplicates of the Fifth Doctor in \"Resurrection of the Daleks\" (1984), followed by an open declaration of hostilities by one of the Dalek Emperors in \"Remembrance of the Daleks\" (1988).\n\nTwo specific events led up to the outbreak of the war: a peace treaty was attempted by President Romana under the \"Act of Master Restitution\". This attempt was followed by the \"Etra Prime Incident\" (\"The Apocalypse Element\"), which some say \"began the escalation of events\". Weapons used by the Time Lords included Bowships, Black Hole Carriers and N-Forms (the last from Davies' 1996 New Adventures novel \"Damaged Goods\"), while the Daleks wielded \"the full might of the Deathsmiths of Goth\" (from the comic strip story \"Black Legacy\" by Alan Moore and David Lloyd), and launched a massive fleet led by the Emperor into the vortex.\n\nThe 'duration' and extent of the War remains unclear. The statement made by Jack Harkness in \"The Parting of the Ways\" \u2013 confirmed by the Doctor \u2013 that the Daleks \"vanished out of time and space\" to fight the War would indicate that it was not waged in normal space-time. Nonetheless, there was fighting on the planet Gallifrey. At some point, however, the conflict engulfed a sufficient bulk of the cosmos for Cass, a character from \"The Night of the Doctor\", to declare that the Daleks and Time Lords had not yet succeeded in their efforts to destroy it - some of it was \"still standing\". Several races hostile to the Time Lords, e.g. the Sontarans, wished to participate but were forbidden to do so.\n\nThe Doctor claims to have fought on the front lines and was present at the Fall of Arcadia. Arcadia was Gallifrey's second city fortified with four hundred \"sky trenches\". These were thought to be impregnable until an invading Dalek squadron swept them away (as seen in the 2013 mini-episode \"The Last Day\").\n\nThe 2013 mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\" reveals that at first the Doctor (at this point the Eighth Doctor) refused to take part in the war, even as it spiralled out of control and threatened to destroy the universe, instead working to help where he could but refusing to fight. This led him to attempt to save a woman from a spaceship crashing towards the planet Karn, who refused his aid because he was a Time Lord (as she claimed she couldn't \"tell the difference\" between the two species any more, implying that the Time Lords were just as destructive as the Daleks). The Doctor was killed in the crash, but was restored to life temporarily by the Sisterhood of Karn, who finally convinced him that for the sake of the universe, he had to take a stand and fight. They further offered an elixir that would control his regeneration and allow him to take a form best suited for the task. The Doctor accepted, remarking that there was no need for a Doctor in a universe consumed by war and requested that the Sisterhood make him a \"warrior\". He drank the elixir and regenerated into the War Doctor, declaring himself \"Doctor no more.\"\n\nDavros, the creator of the Daleks, also fought during the war after his creations (which had turned against him during \"Genesis of the Daleks\" but caused his revival in \"Destiny of the Daleks\") rehabilitated him to a leadership position. In the first year of the War, Davros' command ship was seemingly destroyed at the Gates of Elysium after flying into the jaws of the Nightmare Child. Unbeknownst to the Doctor, who had tried to save him, Davros was rescued by Dalek Caan, who had escaped the events of \"Evolution of the Daleks\" (2007) via an emergency temporal shift.\n\nThe war resulted in countless millions dying endless deaths, as time travel was used by both sides to reverse battles that caused massive fatalities on both sides. These excesses of temporal warfare eventually led to the whole of the conflict becoming \"time-locked\", so that no time traveller could go back into it. The Doctor described the final days of the war as \"hell\", featuring \"the Skaro Degradations, the Horde of Travesties, the Nightmare Child, the Could-Have-Been King with his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres\".\n\nAs the war progressed, the Time Lords became increasingly aggressive and unscrupulous. Growing in desperation, they accessed a cache of forbidden doomsday weapons fashioned by the ancients of Gallifrey known as the Omega Arsenal. All were wielded against the Dalek menace save one: \"the Moment\". Moreover, they resurrected the Master, a renegade Time Lord and nemesis to the Doctor, as they believed him to be the \"perfect warrior for a time war\". However, after the Dalek Emperor gained control of the Cruciform, the Master deserted his post, used the chameleon arch to disguise himself as a human and escaped to a time period shortly before the end of the universe. Genetically a human, he escaped the destruction of all Time Lords as well as detection by the Doctor \u2013 who was unaware of his resurrection in the first place. The Master also remained ignorant of the latter phase and outcome of the war until he emerged from hiding, when he was told by the Doctor many years later.\n\nLeadership among the Time Lords remained vague during the earlier phase of the war. Ultimately, Rassilon, founder of the Time Lord society and its time travel technology who had discovered the secret of immortality, returned to assume leadership as Lord President, a position he was first to hold. Refusing the possibility of his civilisation being destroyed by the Daleks, Rassilon prepared a doomsday scenario, the so-called \"Ultimate Sanction\". This genocidal scheme included sacrificing all of time itself, thereby destroying the Daleks and all life in the universe. The Time Lords themselves would have transcended into a non-corporeal collective consciousness that would be the only sentient form of life in existence. The Time Lords, apparently hardened by the horrors of war, gave near-unanimous support for this plan \u2013 only two Time Lords dissented when the issue was put to a full vote. Prior to the vote, when one of the Council, the Partisan, suggested shelving the Ultimate Sanction and that it may be better if Gallifrey were destroyed, Rassilon disintegrated her.\n\nWhile the High Council continued to lead Time Lord society during the war, a separate War Council was tasked with overseeing the war itself, as well as Gallifrey's defences. The War Council was led by an unknown Time Lord general. During the last days of the Time War, the War Council apparently became disillusioned with the High Council.\n\nOn the last day of the Time War, the Dalek fleets surrounding Gallifrey launched what was said to be their biggest attack ever on the planet. The ten million Dalek ships subjected Gallifrey to a massive orbital bombardment and deployed numerous Daleks to invade the surface. Dalek forces captured the city of Arcadia, then laid siege to the capital itself. However, they were unable to break through the capital's sky trenches. Upon learning of Rassilon's \"Ultimate Sanction\", the War Doctor stole an ancient Gallifreyan weapon known as the Moment, or the Galaxy Eater, and intended to reduce Gallifrey into \"rocks and dust\" with the inferno wiping out the Dalek fleet. By this point, the entire period of war had become \"time locked\", so that no time traveller could enter or exit it.\n\nFearing that the Doctor would use the Moment, Rassilon and his fellow councillors attempted to escape the Lock by retroactively planting a four-note drumbeat (the rhythm of a Time Lord's heartbeats) into the Master's brain as a child and cause his descent into madness. From there, once the signal is made tangible enough, a Whitepoint Star, a diamond only found on Gallifrey, is used to create a link between the final day of the Time War and Earth so the Master could release Gallifrey from the Time Lock. The plan ultimately failed, as the Doctor destroyed the diamond link and the Master apparently sacrificed his life to take revenge on Rassilon, sending the Time Lords back to their apparent doom. Unknown to almost everyone involved however, this was not the final end of the Time Lords. As \"the Moment\" had a will of its own, it showed the War Doctor an alternative solution and ultimately enabled thirteen incarnations of the Doctor, ranging from the First Doctor through the Twelfth Doctor, to gather to save Gallifrey by freezing it in time and removing it from the universe. The sudden disappearance of Gallifrey left the Daleks firing upon and subsequently annihilating themselves, while the Time Lords remained, albeit powerless and forgotten.\n\nAs the War Doctor regenerated into the Ninth Doctor, his memory of him and his other incarnations saving Gallifrey was wiped as a means for his timeline to correct itself, leaving the Doctor with the belief he had in fact used the Moment to destroy Gallifrey, the Time Lords, and the Daleks. The Doctor was haunted with the false knowledge of his home planet's demise, with even some of his enemies like the Beast using that guilt against him. The Doctor's later incarnations even displayed a self-loathing towards their War Doctor incarnation before the Eleventh Doctor and Tenth Doctor learned the truth and accepted him as a legitimate Doctor incarnation. Though the destruction of both races marked the end of the war, the Ninth Doctor learns of the Dalek Emperor's survival with Rose wiping out both him and his fleet in \"The Parting of the Ways\" as Bad Wolf while proclaiming the final end of the War. This is affirmed by the Tenth Doctor, who describes to Jack Harkness in \"Utopia\" that his resurrection by Rose was part of the final act of the War.\n\nFollowing what was for all intents and purposes the removal of the Time Lords, the Doctor believed himself to be the last of his race. The removal of the Time Lords also had a profound impact on time travel. In the 2006 episode \"Rise of the Cybermen\" when the Tenth Doctor, Rose Tyler and Mickey Smith are trapped in an alternative reality, the Doctor explains that, when the Time Lords were around, travel between parallel universes was less difficult but, with their demise, the paths between worlds are now closed. The Time Lords could also prevent or repair paradoxes such as the one created by Rose in an attempt to save her father's life in a traffic accident. After the Time Lords' disappearance, such a paradox summons the Reapers, who descended to \"sterilise the wound\" in time by devouring everything in sight, and are only stopped by Pete Tyler killing himself.\n\nBecause of the Time Lock, along with the danger of creating a paradox, the Doctor is prevented from going back in time and saving the Time Lords. The Tenth Doctor warns another character against trying to alter his own timeline as such meddling would \"destroy two-thirds of the universe\" and resists an offer by Krillitane Mr Finch, using the Skasis Paradigm, which would have given the Doctor the ability to reorder the universe and allowed him to stop the war. The Doctor would only change his decision and assure his race's survival after contributing to it as the Eleventh Doctor during the events of \"The Day of the Doctor\".\n\nThroughout series 5, the Eleventh Doctor encounters cracks in \"the skin of the universe\". The Doctor learns that the cracks, which erase those they consume from history, are a result of the Silence causing the Doctor's TARDIS to explode on 26 June 2010. During the events of \"The Big Bang\", the Doctor manages to close all the cracks using the TARDIS explosion and the Pandorica to produce a second Big Bang that restores the universe. During the events of \"The Time of the Doctor\", the Doctor discovers one remaining crack on the planet Trenzalore, through which the Time Lords transmit a \"truth field\" that ensures that all inhabitants speak the truth, along with the First Question: \"Doctor Who?\". The intention is for the Doctor to give his true name, which will verify to the Time Lords it is safe for them to return to the universe. Fleets of various races, some being former War participants, gathered in Trenzalore's orbit to either prevent the Doctor from speaking his name, or resume the War if the Time Lords return. The Church of the Papal Mainframe undergoes a faith change into the Church of the Silence as a dedication to keeping the peace, with a rogue chapter led by Madame Kovarian unknowingly causing the events in series 5 and 6 and leading to the Doctor's arrival on Trenzalore. In the end, the Time Lords remain in exile and close the remaining crack, but not before heeding Clara's plea for them to save the Doctor, old and weary from his years protecting Trenzalore, granting him a new cycle of regenerations, which allow him to destroy the Dalek fleet surrounding the planet.\n\nDespite the Doctor's efforts, not all Daleks perished in the war. The Ninth Doctor encounters a single, dysfunctional Dalek in a museum on Earth in 2012, which had apparently been on Earth for 50 years. It eventually commits suicide after gaining human feelings via Rose Tyler touching it. The Doctor later discovers that the Dalek Emperor itself had also survived, and had gone on to build a whole new Dalek race, using the organic material of human cadavers by completely rewriting their DNA. The destruction of the Emperor and its fleet in the year 200,100 during an attack on Earth at the conclusion of the 2005 series by a time vortex-augmented Rose Tyler is accompanied by her declaration that \"the Time War ends\".\n\nThe elite Cult of Skaro also survived by fleeing into the Void between dimensions in a specialised ship, taking with them the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison ship containing millions of Daleks. The new Dalek army released from the Ark on Earth in the 21st century \u2013 after the Ark is touched by a time-traveler, Mickey Smith \u2013 is sucked back into the Void due to the actions of the Tenth Doctor, but the specially-equipped cult members use an \"emergency temporal shift\" to escape that fate. They reappear in 1930 in New York where they try to use humans to create a new race of Daleks. While three members of the Cult of Skaro are killed, the fourth \u2013 Dalek Caan \u2013 escapes through another emergency temporal shift. Dalek Caan returns to the Time War and, at the cost of its sanity, rescues the Daleks' creator, Davros. Davros subsequently uses cells from his own body to create a new Dalek Empire and keeps Caan close at his side because of the latter's prophetic abilities. The Daleks attempt to destroy all reality with a 'Reality Bomb' powered by 27 stolen Worlds, leaving themselves the only creatures. However, Caan manipulated Davros to help the Doctor and Donna Noble defeat the Daleks after seeing the damage the Daleks had caused throughout time. The Daleks are destroyed by a clone of the Tenth Doctor, while Davros and Caan are left behind on the Dalek flagship as it is destroyed.\n\nOne ship containing three Daleks escaped that defeat after accidentally falling through time, where it then picked up a trace of a Progenitor device that contained pure Dalek DNA. However, because these Daleks had been created from the DNA of Davros, the Progenitor did not accept them as true \"Daleks\"; to restart the Progenitor, the Daleks trick the Eleventh Doctor into activating it for them during World War II by declaring them Daleks (which the device accepts). Once activated, the Progenitor device created a new \"Paradigm\" of Daleks that destroyed the previous Daleks and escaped through time, forming a new race of Daleks. Eventually learning of the Time Lords' survival alongside various other races during the events of \"The Time of the Doctor\", the Daleks laid siege on the planet Trenzalore for centuries to either resume the Time War or kill the Doctor before he could release the Time Lords back into the universe. In the end, the Dalek fleet was wiped out by the Eleventh Doctor during the first phase of his regeneration.\n\nAfter the Time War, the Doctor is convinced that he is the only surviving Time Lord, saying that he would know of any others if they had survived. The last words of the Face of Boe were \"You Are Not Alone\". The cryptic statement is explained when the Doctor encounters a man named Professor Yana who is revealed to be the Master. The Master had been hiding in human form at the end of the universe using a Chameleon Arch, having escaped the destruction of both the Time Lords and the Daleks. By taking human form, he avoided detection by the Doctor, who was apparently unaware of his nemesis' resurrection during the Time War. (Later spin-off stories reveal that the Doctor and the Master had fought together during the War for a time, but the Doctor was simply unaware that the Master had escaped death in the War itself.)\n\nThe timelines of other races and planets shifted without the inhabitants of the worlds affected being aware of the changes in history, as they were a part of them. Most affected were the Greater Animus, which died; the Zygons, who lost their home planet, Zygor, and attempted to conquer Earth for its resources; the Eternals, who apparently fled this reality in despair; and the Gelth, who lost their physical form and were reduced to gaseous beings, who attempted to possess human corpses in 1869 using a Time Rift in Cardiff. The Gelth described the war's impact as \"invisible to lower species but devastating to higher forms\", such as the Forest of Cheem, which was distraught at the bloodshed. It is also said to have destroyed the unnamed race that Eve originated from.\n\nThe Time War provides a convenient in-story explanation for any contradictions in series continuity: for example, writer Paul Cornell has suggested that Earth's destruction by an expanding sun in \"The End of the World\" five billion years hence, as opposed to the original depiction of its demise around the year 10,000,000 AD in \"The Ark\" (1966), can be attributed to changes in history due to the War. Steven Moffat, writer and later executive producer for \"Doctor Who\", has gone further, arguing that \"a television series which embraces both the ideas of parallel universes and the concept of changing time can't have a continuity error\u2014it's impossible for \"Doctor Who\" to get it wrong, because we can just say 'he changed time\u2014it's a time ripple from the Time War.\n\nThe Last Great Time War and previous time wars also feature in various Doctor Who spin-off media.\n\nIn a story arc stretching through several of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels (written before the new series began in 2005), the Doctor learns that, at some point in his personal future, a war will be fought between the Time Lords and an unnamed Enemy. The Eighth Doctor first becomes involved in the events of the war during the events of \"Alien Bodies\", when he unintentionally learns of the War while attending an auction that is attended by various parties in the war- including a future Time Lord, a representative of the Enemy, Faction Paradox, the UNIT of the 2050s, and agents of the rogue Time Lords known as the Celestis-, not only learning about the War ahead of schedule, but also learning that the auction is for the body of his future self, due to his biodata codes being the only means of accessing dangerous Time Lord secrets after he died in the early days of the War. In the later novel \"The Taking of Planet 5\", the Doctor must stop a group of future Time Lords from releasing the monstrous Fendahl in an attempt to use it as a weapon, which results in the destruction of the Celestis pocket dimension. Later in this story arc, Gallifrey is also destroyed as a result of the Eighth Doctor attempting to prevent the war from beginning as the Enemy begin their first assault in \"The Ancestor Cell\", having learned that he unintentionally provoked the War after his history was changed by Faction Paradox, the Doctor believing that it would be better for the Time Lords to die now rather than experience a war that would dehumanise them to the point of becoming monsters which all evidence suggests they could not win. This cataclysm also creates an event horizon in time that prevents anyone from entering Gallifrey's relative past or travelling from it to the present or future. In the aftermath of this conflict Gallifrey was essentially erased from history, and the universe thrown in to chaos, allowing other species to try and take control of history, while also giving things like magic to exist in the universe, as in the main timeline the Time Lords had removed and erased such things form the universe near its beginning. The last Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, \"The Gallifrey Chronicles\", establishes that the Doctor has the ability to restore the planet and its inhabitants, having downloaded the contents of the Matrix into his subconscious mind in the minutes before Gallifrey's destruction, albeit at the cost of his own memories. The novel ends without revealing if he does indeed succeed in restoring Gallifrey. However a vision the Doctor received of the future in a book not long before showed that Gallifrey would be restored to existence in the future.\n\nRussell T Davies, executive producer of the series, commented that there is no connection between the War of the books and the Time War of the television series, comparing Gallifrey being destroyed twice with Earth's two World Wars. He also said that he was \"usually happy for old and new fans to invent the Complete History of the Doctor in their heads, completely free of the production team's hot and heavy hands\".\n\nThe future of the Time War which was erased by the Eighth Doctor in the Eighth Doctor Adventures' War, referred to as the \"War in Heaven\", also appears in the \"Faction Paradox\" novels conceived by Lawrence Miles (as well as some of the aftermath of its later erasure from history) .\n\nIn three comic strip stories written by Alan Moore in 1980 and 1981, the Time Lords, assisted by the Special Executive, fight a time war early in their history against the \"Order of the Black Sun\", based some thirty thousand years in their future. The first strike of the war, from the Time Lords' point of view, is when a Black Sun agent travels back in time, and attacks the Time Lords just as they are about to turn the star Qqaba into a power source for their time experiments. This also causes the apparent demise of the stellar engineer Omega. The Time Lords do not know why the Black Sun (whom they had never encountered before the attack) should have wanted to strike at them, and surmise that it was for something they had yet to do. Years later, at a diplomatic conference, a representative of the Order is murdered by the Sontarans, and the murder is blamed on the Time Lords. This provides the motivation for the war's beginnings, as from the Order's point of view, the Time Lords are the ones who strike first.\n\n\"Gallifrey\" is the umbrella title of a series of audio plays by Big Finish Productions, set on Gallifrey during Romana's tenure as President. In \"Gallifrey: Panacea\", the final chapter of the third series, the Time Lord Irving Braxiatel speaks of \"rumours out there in the big wide universe\u2014more than rumours, in fact\u2014that something's coming to Gallifrey, something worse than you could possibly imagine.\" Because of these rumours, Braxiatel engineers the removal of the Time Lord biodata archive from Gallifrey, in order that the Time Lords might someday be restored after their planet meets its doom. Former Big Finish producer Gary Russell indicated in a forum posting on \"Outpost Gallifrey\" that this was a reference to the television series' Time War.\n\nThe sixth series of \"Gallifrey\" features the Daleks invading Gallifrey, but this invasion was undone thanks to Romana, Leela, K9 and Narvin, aided by Romana's future self. The ninth series more directly featured the Time War with Romana and Leela playing key roles, including Leela being sent on a mission with the Derek Jacobi Master, Irving Braxiatel taking Ace on a mission to test her ability to fight in the War, and the resurrection of Rassilon through a complex Time Lord project that allowed Rassilon's consciousness to take over the body of another Time Lord.\n\nThe later Companion Chronicles audio story, \"The Catalyst\", implies that Leela survived the Time War; she mentions that her adopted homeworld no longer exists and she ages rapidly due to the Time Lords no longer being able to keep her young.\n\nThe \"Dark Eyes\" audio series is also in effect a lead up to the Last Great Time War from the Doctor's perspective, the first series being a complex plan by the Daleks to erase the Time Lords from existence. \"Dark Eyes 2\" also sees the resurrection of the Master in preparation for the war.\n\nThe \"Doom Coalition\" series begins when the Eighth Doctor and his companion Liv Chenka are assigned to recapture the Eleven, a Time Lord criminal who suffers from a unique form of mental illness where all of his past incarnations are active in his head at once, the two swiftly acquiring a new companion in the form of Helen Sinclair. In the course of their travels, the Doctor, Liv and Helen learn that their hunt for the Eleven is being manipulated by the Doctor's former friend Padrac, who has become convinced that Gallifrey is destined to be destroyed in every future, and has thus masterminded a complex plan to destroy the rest of the universe to ensure Gallifrey's survival, with the Eleven's actions drawing the Doctor into positions where he will discover the equipment needed for Padrac's scheme to succeed. Although Padrac gathers his equipment and prepares to unleash a powerful psychic blast that will destroy the universe, the Doctor is eventually able to thwart this plan by disrupting Padrac's equipment at the last minute, informing his former friend that he will bear the burden of Gallifrey's future destruction if that prophecy is correct but refuses to believe that it is acceptable to destroy the rest of the universe to save one planet.\n\nThe \"Ravenous\" series depicts the aftermath of \"Doom Coalition\" as the Eighth Doctor and Liv search for the lost Helen and resume their travels while learning of the return of the Ravenous, a race of beings who essentially 'eat' regeneration energy. In the audio \"Deeptime Frontier\" the Doctor, Liv and Helen discover a Time Lord experiment to acquire new sources of power if the Eye of Harmony should be lost, foreshadowing how the Doctor's TARDIS will develop such independence after Gallifrey's destruction. The series finale, \"Day of the Master\", features the War Master (Derek Jacobi) assisting his past and future selves in acquiring the Matrix print of Artron, an ancient Time Lord scientist who found means of extending a Time Lord's regeneration cycle, with the Masters using this to restore their own ability to regenerate, setting up the existence of the Master witnessed in \"Dark Eyes\"; the War Master all-but-explicitly states that he has made a deal with the Time Lords to save himself with this knowledge, albeit only to give himself a new cycle of standard regenerations.\n\nIn this comic book series an insectoid race called the Skrawn appeared, whose planet Kolox the Doctor claims was destroyed in the Time War.\n\nThe \"Doctor Who Magazine\" comic storyline \"The Clockwise Man\", which was set during the Twelfth Doctor's era, included a flashback to the Time War and early in the life of the War Doctor, depicting the events that led to the apparent death of the Doctor's old friend Fey Truscott-Sade and the War Doctor's decision to renounce his name.\n\nIn the IDW comic miniseries \"The Forgotten\", the Tenth Doctor recounts to Martha Jones a story from the Eighth Doctor's participation in the Time War. The Eighth Doctor was imprisoned by a race of robots for several weeks on a planet in the middle of the war, before teaming up with a Malmooth fellow prisoner and faking his death to escape. It is revealed his capture was staged by him so that he could acquire the Great Key he needed to arm a modified De-Mat Gun that could be used to seal the Medusa Cascade. The Tenth Doctor further implies that the Eighth Doctor died, alone and companionless, at the end of the Time War. This conflicts with \"The Night of the Doctor\" and \"The Day of the Doctor\"'s depiction of the Time War, where it's established that the Eighth Doctor died and regenerated into the War Doctor before becoming the Ninth Doctor, and the Eighth Doctor refused to fight in the War until shortly before his regeneration into the War Doctor.\n\nIn \"The Mad Woman in the Attic\", a two-part serial of the \"Doctor Who\" spinoff series \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", Eve speaks about the Time War, stating that her people could see timelines; this made them a target, and they were exterminated.\n\nIn July 2014, the BBC released the novel \"Engines of War\" by George Mann, which features the War Doctor in a novel set in the Time War itself. During the novel, the War Doctor and his new companion Cinder\u2014a human resistance fighter on the Dalek-occupied world of Moldox\u2014discover that the Daleks intend to use the temporal anomalies of the Tantalus Eye, a rift in time in the Moldox system, to develop a weapon that could completely erase Gallifrey and the Time Lords from history, with Rassilon's plan to stop the Dalek plot involving the destruction of the Eye and all inhabited planets around it. Refusing to accept this, the Doctor is able to sabotage Rassilon's plan and use the energy of the Tantalus Eye to erase the Daleks' scheme, but the actions of a Time Lord agent result in Cinder's death, leaving the War Doctor resolved to end the war once and for all as he recognises how far his people have fallen in the name of victory.\n\n\"The War Doctor\" series was produced by Big Finish Productions following John Hurt's role as the War Doctor in \u201cThe Day of the Doctor\u201d. Hurt reprised his role alongside Jacqueline Pearce as Cardinal Ollistra, who frequently sends the War Doctor on missions to give the Time Lords the upper hand over the Daleks. Following Hurt's death, the series ended after four volumes in February 2017.\nA follow-up series was subsequently launched featuring the Eighth Doctor and set during the early years of the Time War.\n\nWith the announcement of \"The War Doctor\", Big Finish Productions also announced a prequel box set featuring the Eighth Doctor during the early days of the conflict. This was later expanded into a four-volume series set prior to his regeneration in \"The Night of the Doctor\" but after \"Ravenous\", the sequel to \"Doom Coalition\". Paul McGann will reprise his role with Rakhee Thakrar playing Bliss, his new companion. The third volume also features the return of the Valeyard, who is recruited by the Time Lords attempt to be a soldier in the War after he is 'recreated' through an accident when the Doctor uses a transmat while carrying a device that can manipulate biology.\n\nAs well as the \"Time War\" series itself, the Eighth Doctor has also been depicted taking a role in the Time War in various audios that are part of other series. The \"\" audios; \"The Sontaran Ordeal\" sees him caught up in a Sontaran invasion of a planet that has just been 'contaminated' by the Time War so that its once-peaceful history now features centuries of conflict, and \"Day of the Vashta Nerada\" has the Doctor discover an experiment to artificially alter the Vashta Nerada to be used as weapons in the War. The Short Trip audios \"A Heart on Both Sides\" by Rob Nisbet and \"All Hands on Deck\" by Eddie Robson also explore the Doctor's role in the War; \"Heart on Both Sides\" sees the Eighth Doctor working as the assistant to his former companion Nyssa, operating under an alias, to protect her from a rumour he heard in the future about the destruction of a ship matching the description of Nyssa's hospital ship, and \"All Hands on Deck\" sees Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter, joining the Time War and leaving her life on Earth despite the Doctor's pleas for her to join his role as conscientious objector. In \"The Diary of River Song: Series One- The Rulers of the Universe\", the Doctor learns that an ancient race of world-builders have been drawn into the future by the Time War and are destroying planets whose civilisations do not meet their standards, working with his future wife River Song (who communicates with him over a distorted radio to prevent him recognizing her) to disable their planned bomb at galactic centre. In \"The Legacy of Time\" audio \"Lies in Ruins\" the Doctor encounters River and his predecessor's companion Benny Summerfield while he is travelling with a woman called Ria, as the two archaeologists discover what appears to be a fragment of Gallifrey, but it is soon revealed that the 'fragment' of Gallifrey is actually part of a prototype TARDIS while Ria is an android the Doctor created to tell him that he was right as he tried to escape the War, with the events of the audio forcing him to acknowledge that he can't ignore the conflict even if he still refuses to fight in it.\n\nThe War Master series was announced in June 2017 for release in December. The release features Derek Jacobi reprising his role as The Master from the 2007 episode \"Utopia\" and follows the character during the Time War. In the course of these audios, the Master is shown seeking new sources of power for himself, but after he proves unable to control the power of the Heavenly Paradigm, which causes both sides in the Time War to win conflicts they previously lost, the series ends with the Master fleeing in fear to the distant future, setting up his future existence as 'Professor Yana'.\n\n\"Doctor Who Magazine\" revealed that Big Finish will produce another Time War range.\n"

    "title": "The Deer without a Heart",
    "text": "The Deer without a Heart is an ancient fable, attributed to Aesop in Europe and numbered 336 in the Perry Index. It involves a deer (or an ass in Eastern versions) who was twice persuaded by a wily fox to visit the ailing lion. After the lion had killed it, the fox stole and ate the deer's heart. When asked where it is, the fox reasoned that an animal so foolish as to visit a lion in his den cannot have had one, an argument that reflects the ancient belief that the heart was the seat of thoughts and intellect. The story is catalogued as type 52 in the Aarne-Thompson classification system.\n\nThe version of the story found in the Indian \"Panchatantra\" concerns a lion who is persuaded that the cure for his sickness is the ears and heart of an ass. His servant the jackal persuades an ass to accompany him but the lion is too weak to kill the ass on the first attempt and the jackal has to trick it into returning. Afterwards the jackal persuades the hungry lion to leave him with the dead ass and takes the ears and heart for himself. His explanation for their absence is that so silly an animal cannot have had the equipment to hear or to think with.\n\nThe story travelled westwards through a series of translations and adaptations and was eventually carried to Spain by invading Arabs. By this time the details of the story had altered considerably. In one Arab version an ass demands toll of the lion and is killed for this effrontery. The heart is eaten by a fox who says it could never have existed in so stupid an animal. There also exist Jewish versions of the story, in one of which the ass figures as toll-keeper and in the other demands a fare on board ship.\n\nThe story of \"The Lion, the Fox and the Deer\" is an ancient one that first appeared in the poetry of Archilochus and was told at great length in the collection of Babrius. In this the fox twice persuades the deer to visit the lair of a lion too sick to hunt, on the first occasion escaping with an injured ear; the fox explains this as a rough caress and the deer returns to its death. It was only recorded in Greek, so that Mediaeval European variants may equally be of Eastern rather than Western origin. Thus in Marie de France's telling, the lion requires the deer's heart as a cure for its illness, as in the \"Panchatantra\".\n\nThe very different version in her contemporary, Berechiah ha-Nakdan's \"Fox Fables\", appears to owe something to a Latin poem by Avianus, numbered 583 in the Perry Index. In this a boar has its ears cut off as a punishment for roaming in the fields of an estate and later pays for it with his life. A thieving peasant explains the missing heart to his master in the usual way. But in Berechiah's telling the wild boar trespasses in the royal lion's garden and, after losing its ears and eyes in punishment, is finally killed and the heart is stolen by the fox. These final details demonstrate a synthesis with other versions of the fable, of which there appear to be many by this time. A still later Spanish version by Juan Ruiz, involves a musical ass who keeps the lion awake with his discordant music and in this case loses his heart and ears to the wolf.\n\nThe process of transformation continues into modern times. In Stuart Croft's 12-minute film \"The Stag without a Heart\" (2009/10), the story is recounted at length in an endlessly circuitous version by having the fox replace the heart it has stolen in the deer as a means of persuading it to return to the lion's presence.\n"

    "text": "The term red route has been separately adopted for two entirely different highway purposes within the United Kingdom.\n\nIn London, Leeds and the county of West Midlands in the United Kingdom, red routes are major roads on which vehicles are not allowed to stop, first introduced in north and east London in 1991. The prohibition extends to stopping for loading or unloading, and to boarding or alighting from a vehicle (except for licensed taxis and the holders of blue badges). Red routes are mainly used on major bus and commuting routes.\n\nRed routes are marked by . Double red lines mean that the rules and regulations apply at all times and on all days. Single red lines means that the prohibition applies during times displayed on nearby signs or at the entry to the zone. Red route clearways are signed but there are no lines on the road. Stopping is only permitted in lay-bys (red lines are only marked at junctions).\n\nThe 580\u00a0km of red routes in London are policed by \"Red Route Patrols\" and managed by London Streets, an arm of Transport for London.\n\nA similar scheme operates in Edinburgh; here, however, the routes affected \u2013 being marked by the use of green road-surfacing rather than red lines \u2013 are known as \"Greenways\".\n\nA number of hospitals in the United Kingdom have mimicked the red road lines, in and around ambulance dispatch and Accident and Emergency areas. These road markings are to allow ambulances and other emergency vehicles uninhibited access in and out of such areas; whilst these road markings are often respected by road users there is very little (if any) enforcement.\n\nIn Somerset, the local road safety partnership has designated some of the A roads within the county as \"Red Routes\", but in this case the term is used to indicate routes that have a higher than average accident rate.\n\nThe term is similarly used to denote dangerous routes in Northamptonshire, It is not clear that the scheme will be maintained following the closure of the Road Safety Partnership whose initiative it was.\n\nLincolnshire has a similar scheme to the Northamptonshire one.\n\nThe county of Cheshire, and therefore the town of Warrington also use the idea of \"Red Routes\" to designate roads with historically high accident rates.\n\nThe former Suffolk speed camera organisation chose the expression \"Red Route\" to denote routes where high levels of accidents justify the frequency use of mobile speed cameras.\n\nLeicestershire County Council have chosen not to implement a Red Route scheme, believing it can be misleading and arbitrary. They believe in identifying or solving individual danger spots instead.\n\n\n"

PGPfone could be used point-to-point (with two modems) over the public switched telephone network, or over the Internet as an early Voice over IP system.\n\nIn 1996, there were no protocol standards for Voice over IP.

She lived in Sarajevo before the Bosnian war started. During the war, Zlata kept a diary from 1991 to 1993. Like Anne Frank, she also gave a name to her diary, \"Mimmy\". Zlata and her family survived the war and escaped to Paris in 1993, where they stayed for a year. The family has settled down in Dublin, Ireland. This girl mentions in her diary that there was multiple gunshots \"right\" next to her house, where she lived.\n\nIn September 1991, Zlata was given a diary. She immediately began to write in her diary. \nZlata Filipovi\u0107 wrote her diary from 1991 to 1993 during the Bosnian war. Located mostly in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. Zlata began writing her diary in 1991, just after she began fifth grade. The war began just before her eleventh birthday. Zlata's diary chronicles her daily life and the war's increasing impact on her home town of Sarajevo. \nReporter Janine di Giovanni, who met Zlata in 1993 and wrote the introduction to the book, described Zlata as \"the Anne Frank of Sarajevo.\" Like \"The Diary of Anne Frank\", Zlata's diary contains many descriptions of the horrors of war as viewed from the innocent view of a child. Furthermore, both diaries take place during conflicts at least partially motivated by racism and ethnic differences.\n\nIn 1992, a small press in Sarajevo published Zlata's diary and released it for the UNICEF week. Following the release of her diary, Zlata became moderately famous. International journalists visited the Filipovi\u0107 family's apartment and interviewed Zlata. In December 1993, the United Nations helped Zlata and her mother move to Paris.\n\nHer diary has also been adapted into a choral work by Anthony Powers.\n\nCritical reception of the book was overwhelmingly positive. In the New York Times Review of Books, Francine Prose praised the \"pure innocence and desperation\" evident within Zlata's pages, characterizing her as an everygirl. However, Prose was critical of Western publishers looking to cash in by equating Filipovic's story with Anne Frank's, lamenting the indecency of \"contrasting and judging the private writings of children in war\".\n"

He also served as secretary to the county board for ten years, from the 1920s to 1930s.\n\nHayes joined the IRA and was on the IRA Army Council in January 1939 when it declared war on the British government.\n\nWhen IRA chief of staff Se\u00e1n Russell departed on IRA business to the United States (and subsequently to Nazi Germany), Hayes was left in control of the organisation. After Russell's death in August 1940 on board a German U-boat en route to Ireland, Hayes became chief of staff. His time in office was marred by controversy and it is widely believed that he served as an informer to the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.\n\nHayes had sent a plan for the invasion of Northern Ireland by German troops to Germany in April 1940. This plan later became known as Plan Kathleen. He is also known to have met with German agent Hermann G\u00f6rtz on 21 May 1940 in Dublin shortly after the latter's parachuting into Ireland on 5 May 1940 as part of Operation Mainau. Hayes is known to have asked G\u00f6rtz for money and arms to wage a campaign in Northern Ireland, although shortly after this meeting the original Plan Kathleen was discovered. The discovery of the plan led to the acceleration of joint British and Irish military planning for a German invasion known as Plan W.\n\nAnother meeting on 15 August 1940 on Rathgar Road, Dublin organised by Hayes and attended by senior IRA men Paddy McGrath, Tom Harte and Tom Hunt, was also raided by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.\n\nMcGrath and Harte were both arrested and tried by Military Tribunal, established under the Emergency Powers Act 1939. They challenged the legislation in the High Court, seeking a writ of habeas corpus, and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court. They were represented in the courts by Se\u00e1n MacBride. The appeal was unsuccessful, and they were executed by firing squad at Dublin's Mountjoy Prison on 6 September 1940. Irish Executions\n\nOn 30 June 1941, Northern-based IRA men kidnapped Hayes, accusing him of being a spy. By his own account, he was tortured and \"court-martialled\" for \"treason\" by his comrades, and would have been executed, but he bought himself time composing an enormously long confession. He managed to escape in September 1941, and handed himself in to the Garda for protection.\n\nThe Officer Commanding (O/C) of the IRA's Northern Command, Se\u00e1n McCaughey, was convicted on 18 September 1941 of the kidnapping. After a long hunger and thirst strike in Portlaoise prison, McCaughey died on 11 May 1946.\n\nHayes was later sentenced to five years' imprisonment by the Special Criminal Court on account of his IRA activities.\n\nWithin IRA circles, Hayes is still considered a traitor and an informer. One of the main allegations against him was that he informed the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na about IRA arms dumps in Wexford. However, this was later blamed on a Wexford man named Michael Deveraux, an officer of the Wexford Battalion of the IRA who was subsequently abducted and executed by an IRA squad in County Tipperary on Hayes\u2019 orders. George Plant, a Protestant IRA veteran, was later executed in Portlaoise for Devereux's murder.\n\nAfter his release, Hayes resumed his clerical position at Wexford County Council.\n\nHe died in Enniscorthy on 28 December 1974.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Oxidative stress",
    "text": "Oxidative stress reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of reactive oxygen species and a biological system's ability to readily detoxify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage. Disturbances in the normal redox state of cells can cause toxic effects through the production of peroxides and free radicals that damage all components of the cell, including proteins, lipids, and DNA. Oxidative stress from oxidative metabolism causes base damage, as well as strand breaks in DNA. Base damage is mostly indirect and caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated, e.g. O (superoxide radical), OH (hydroxyl radical) and HO (hydrogen peroxide). Further, some reactive oxidative species act as cellular messengers in redox signaling. Thus, oxidative stress can cause disruptions in normal mechanisms of cellular signaling.\n\nIn humans, oxidative stress is thought to be involved in the development of ADHD, cancer, Parkinson's disease, Lafora disease, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, heart failure, myocardial infarction, fragile X syndrome, sickle-cell disease, lichen planus, vitiligo, autism, infection, chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and depression and seems to be characteristic of individuals with Asperger syndrome. However, reactive oxygen species can be beneficial, as they are used by the immune system as a way to attack and kill pathogens. Short-term oxidative stress may also be important in prevention of aging by induction of a process named mitohormesis.\n\nChemically, oxidative stress is associated with increased production of oxidizing species or a significant decrease in the effectiveness of antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione. The effects of oxidative stress depend upon the size of these changes, with a cell being able to overcome small perturbations and regain its original state. However, more severe oxidative stress can cause cell death, and even moderate oxidation can trigger apoptosis, while more intense stresses may cause necrosis.\n\nProduction of reactive oxygen species is a particularly destructive aspect of oxidative stress. Such species include free radicals and peroxides. Some of the less reactive of these species (such as superoxide) can be converted by oxidoreduction reactions with transition metals or other redox cycling compounds (including quinones) into more aggressive radical species that can cause extensive cellular damage. Most long-term effects are caused by damage to DNA. DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation is similar to oxidative stress, and these lesions have been implicated in aging and cancer. Biological effects of single-base damage by radiation or oxidation, such as 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol, have been extensively studied. Recently the focus has shifted to some of the more complex lesions. Tandem DNA lesions are formed at substantial frequency by ionizing radiation and metal-catalyzed HO reactions. Under anoxic conditions, the predominant double-base lesion is a species in which C8 of guanine is linked to the 5-methyl group of an adjacent 3'-thymine (G[8,5- Me]T). Most of these oxygen-derived species are produced by normal aerobic metabolism. Normal cellular defense mechanisms destroy most of these. Repair of oxidative damages to DNA is frequent and ongoing, largely keeping up with newly induced damages. In rat urine about 74,000 oxidative DNA adducts per cell per day are excreted. However, there is a steady state level of oxidative damages, as well, in the DNA of a cell. There are about 24,000 oxidative DNA adducts per cell in young rats and 66,000 adducts per cell in old rats. Likewise, any damage to cells is constantly repaired. However, under the severe levels of oxidative stress that cause necrosis, the damage causes ATP depletion, preventing controlled apoptotic death and causing the cell to simply fall apart.\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, are primary targets for free radical and singlet oxygen oxidations. For example, in tissues and cells, the free radical oxidation of linoleic acid produces racemic mixtures of 13-hydroxy-9\"Z\",11\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid, 13-hydroxy-9\"E\",11\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-10\"E\",12-\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid (9-EE-HODE), and 11-hydroxy-9\"Z\",12-\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid as well as 4-Hydroxynonenal while singlet oxygen attacks linoleic acid to produce (presumed but not yet proven to be racemic mixtures of) 13-hydroxy-9\"Z\",11\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-10\"E\",12-\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid, 10-hydroxy-8\"E\",12\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-9\"Z\"-13-\"E\"-octadecadienoic (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid and 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid). Similar attacks on arachidonic acid produce a far larger set of products including various isoprostanes, hydroperoxy- and hydroxy- eicosatetraenoates, and 4-hydroxyalkenals. While many of these products are used as markers of oxidative stress, the products derived from linoleic acid appear far more predominant than arachidonic acid products and therefore easier to identify and quantify in, for example, atheromatous plaques. Certain linoleic acid products have also been proposed to be markers for specific types of oxidative stress. For example, the presence of racemic 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE mixtures reflects free radical oxidation of linoleic acid whereas the presence of racemic 10-hydroxy-8\"E\",12\"Z\"-octadecadienoic acid and 12-hydroxy-9\"Z\"-13-\"E\"-octadecadienoic acid reflects singlet oxygen attack on linoleic acid. In addition to serving as markers, the linoleic and arachidonic acid products can contribute to tissue and/or DNA damage but also act as signals to stimulate pathways which function to combat oxidative stress.\n\nTable adapted from.\n\nOne source of reactive oxygen under normal conditions in humans is the leakage of activated oxygen from mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation. However, \"E. coli\" mutants that lack an active electron transport chain produced as much hydrogen peroxide as wild-type cells, indicating that other enzymes contribute the bulk of oxidants in these organisms. One possibility is that multiple redox-active flavoproteins all contribute a small portion to the overall production of oxidants under normal conditions.\n\nOther enzymes capable of producing superoxide are xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidases and cytochromes P450. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by a wide variety of enzymes including several oxidases. Reactive oxygen species play important roles in cell signalling, a process termed redox signaling. Thus, to maintain proper cellular homeostasis, a balance must be struck between reactive oxygen production and consumption.\n\nThe best studied cellular antioxidants are the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. Less well studied (but probably just as important) enzymatic antioxidants are the peroxiredoxins and the recently discovered sulfiredoxin. Other enzymes that have antioxidant properties (though this is not their primary role) include paraoxonase, glutathione-S transferases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases.\n\nThe amino acid methionine is prone to oxidation, but oxidized methionine can be reversible. Oxidation of methionine is shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of adjacent Ser/Thr/Tyr sites in proteins. This gives a plausible mechanism for cells to couple oxidative stress signals with cellular mainstream signaling such as phosphorylation.\n\nOxidative stress is suspected to be important in neurodegenerative diseases including Lou Gehrig's disease (aka MND or ALS), Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, autism, and Multiple sclerosis. Indirect evidence via monitoring biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species production, antioxidant defense indicates oxidative damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases, while cumulative oxidative stress with disrupted mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial damage are related with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nOxidative stress is thought to be linked to certain cardiovascular disease, since oxidation of LDL in the vascular endothelium is a precursor to plaque formation. Oxidative stress also plays a role in the ischemic cascade due to oxygen reperfusion injury following hypoxia. This cascade includes both strokes and heart attacks. Oxidative stress has also been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Oxidative stress also contributes to tissue injury following irradiation and hyperoxia, as well as in diabetes.\n\nOxidative stress is likely to be involved in age-related development of cancer. The reactive species produced in oxidative stress can cause direct damage to the DNA and are therefore mutagenic, and it may also suppress apoptosis and promote proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis. Infection by \"Helicobacter pylori\" which increases the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in human stomach is also thought to be important in the development of gastric cancer.\n\nThe use of antioxidants to prevent some diseases is controversial. In a high-risk group like smokers, high doses of beta carotene increased the rate of lung cancer since high doses of beta-carotene in conjunction of high oxygen tension due to smoking results in a pro-oxidant effect and an antioxidant effect when oxygen tension isn't high. In less high-risk groups, the use of vitamin E appears to reduce the risk of heart disease. However, while consumption of food rich in vitamin E may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in middle-aged to older men and women, using vitamin E supplements also appear to result in an increase in total mortality, heart failure, and hemorrhagic stroke. The American Heart Association therefore recommends the consumption of food rich in antioxidant vitamins and other nutrients, but does not recommend the use of vitamin E supplements to prevent cardiovascular disease. In other diseases, such as Alzheimer's, the evidence on vitamin E supplementation is also mixed. Since dietary sources contain a wider range of carotenoids and vitamin E tocopherols and tocotrienols from whole foods, \"ex post facto\" epidemiological studies can have differing conclusions than artificial experiments using isolated compounds. However, AstraZeneca's radical scavenging nitrone drug NXY-059 shows some efficacy in the treatment of stroke.\n\nOxidative stress (as formulated in Harman's free radical theory of aging) is also thought to contribute to the aging process. While there is good evidence to support this idea in model organisms such as \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", recent evidence from Michael Ristow's laboratory suggests that oxidative stress may also promote life expectancy of \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" by inducing a secondary response to initially increased levels of reactive oxygen species. The situation in mammals is even less clear. Recent epidemiological findings support the process of mitohormesis, however a 2007 meta-analysis indicating studies with a low risk of bias (randomization, blinding, follow-up) find that some popular antioxidant supplements (Vitamin A, Beta Carotene, and Vitamin E) may increase mortality risk (although studies more prone to bias reported the reverse).\n\nThe USDA removed the table showing the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Foods Release 2 (2010) table due to the lack of evidence that the antioxidant level present in a food translated into a related antioxidant effect in the body.\n\nMetals such as iron, copper, chromium, vanadium, and cobalt are capable of redox cycling in which a single electron may be accepted or donated by the metal. This action catalyzes production of reactive radicals and reactive oxygen species. The presence of such metals in biological systems in an uncomplexed form (not in a protein or other protective metal complex) can significantly increase the level of oxidative stress. These metals are thought to induce Fenton reactions and the Haber-Weiss reaction, in which hydroxyl radical is generated from hydrogen peroxide. The hydroxyl radical then can modify amino acids. For example, meta-tyrosine and ortho-tyrosine form by hydroxylation of phenylalanine. Other reactions include lipid peroxidation and oxidation of nucleobases. Metal catalyzed oxidations also lead to irreversible modification of R (Arg), K (Lys), P (Pro) and T (Thr) Excessive oxidative-damage leads to protein degradation or aggregation.\n\nThe reaction of transition metals with proteins oxidated by Reactive Oxygen Species or Reactive Nitrogen Species can yield reactive products that accumulate and contribute to aging and disease. For example, in Alzheimer's patients, peroxidized lipids and proteins accumulate in lysosomes of the brain cells.\n\nCertain organic compounds in addition to metal redox catalysts can also produce reactive oxygen species. One of the most important classes of these are the quinones. Quinones can redox cycle with their conjugate semiquinones and hydroquinones, in some cases catalyzing the production of superoxide from dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide from superoxide.\n\nThe immune system uses the lethal effects of oxidants by making production of oxidizing species a central part of its mechanism of killing pathogens; with activated phagocytes producing both ROS and reactive nitrogen species. These include superoxide , nitric oxide (\u2022NO) and their particularly reactive product, peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Although the use of these highly reactive compounds in the cytotoxic response of phagocytes causes damage to host tissues, the non-specificity of these oxidants is an advantage since they will damage almost every part of their target cell. This prevents a pathogen from escaping this part of immune response by mutation of a single molecular target.\n\nSperm DNA fragmentation appears to be an important factor in the aetiology of male infertility, since men with high DNA fragmentation levels have significantly lower odds of conceiving. Oxidative stress is the major cause of DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa. A high level of the oxidative DNA damage 8-OHdG is associated with abnormal spermatozoa and male infertility.\n\nIn a rat model of premature aging, oxidative stress induced DNA damage in the neocortex and hippocampus was substantially higher than in normally aging control rats. Numerous studies have shown that the level of 8-OHdG, a product of oxidative stress, increases with age in the brain and muscle DNA of the mouse, rat, gerbil and human. Further information on the association of oxidative DNA damage with aging is presented in the article DNA damage theory of aging. However, it was recently shown that the fluoroquinolone antibiotic enoxacin can diminish aging signals and promote lifespan extension in nematodes \" C. elegans \" by inducing oxidative stress.\n\nThe great oxygenation event began with the biologically induced appearance of oxygen in the earth\u2019s atmosphere about 2.45 billion years ago. The rise of oxygen levels due to cyanobacterial photosynthesis in ancient microenvironments was probably highly toxic to the surrounding biota. Under these conditions, the selective pressure of oxidative stress is thought to have driven the evolutionary transformation of an archaeal lineage into the first eukaryotes. Oxidative stress might have acted in synergy with other environmental stresses (such as ultraviolet radiation and/or desiccation) to drive this selection. Selective pressure for efficient repair of oxidative DNA damages may have promoted the evolution of eukaryotic sex involving such features as cell-cell fusions, cytoskeleton-mediated chromosome movements and emergence of the nuclear membrane. Thus the evolution of meiotic sex and eukaryogenesis may have been inseparable processes that evolved in large part to facilitate repair of oxidative DNA damages.\n"

His MLB career started modestly, as he played in only 82 games over his first two seasons, though he still hit a very respectable .306 in 271 at-bats. Cash established himself as a solid singles hitter and a good defensive second baseman in his time in Pittsburgh. He was the Pirates' primary second baseman from 1971 to 1973, but his playing time was reduced somewhat by military service commitments and by the presence on the team of veteran second baseman Bill Mazeroski and rising star Rennie Stennett. After the 1973 season, with Stennett ready to play regularly and another excellent young second baseman (Willie Randolph) in their minor league system, the Pirates traded Cash to the Phillies for pitcher Ken Brett.\n\nWith the Phillies from 1974 to 1976, Cash became a true everyday player, missing only two games over three seasons. He made the All-Star team each year, and batted .300 or better with over 200 hits in both 1974 and 1975.\n\nAfter the 1976 season, Cash signed as a free agent with the Expos.

    "text": "Ignaz Aurelius Fessler, aka Fe\u00dfler (; May 18, 1756 \u2013 December 15, 1839) was a Hungarian ecclesiastic, politician, historian and freemason.\n\nFessler was born in the village of Zurndorf in the hungarian Moson County. In 1773, he joined the order of Capuchin friars, and in 1779 was ordained priest. He had meanwhile continued his classical and philological studies, and his liberal views brought him into frequent conflict with his superiors.\n\nIn 1784, while at the monastery of M\u00f6dling, near Vienna, he wrote to the emperor Joseph II, making suggestions for the better education of the clergy and drawing his attention to the irregularities of the monasteries. The searching investigation which followed raised up against him many implacable enemies. In 1784 he was appointed professor of Oriental languages and hermeneutics in the university of Lemberg, when he took the degree of doctor of divinity; and shortly afterwards he was released from his monastic vows on the intervention of the emperor.\n\nIn 1788 he brought out his tragedy of \"Sidney\", an expos\u00e9 of the tyranny of James II and of the fanaticism of the Roman Catholics in England. This was attacked so violently as profane and revolutionary that he was compelled to resign his office and seek refuge in Silesia. In Breslau he met with a cordial reception from G. W. Komn, the publisher, and was, moreover, subsequently employed by the prince of Carolath-Schbnaich as tutor to his sons. In 1791 Fessler was converted to Lutheranism and next year contracted an unhappy marriage, which was dissolved in 1802, when he married again.\n\nIn 1796 he went to Berlin, where he founded a humanitarian society. In April 1800, through his introduction, the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte was initiated into freemasonry in a Berlin lodge. Fessler was commissioned by the freemasons to assist Fichte in reforming the statutes and ritual of their lodge. At first Fichte was the warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid Fessler in his proposed reform. But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among freemasons. Soon after this, Fessler obtained a government appointment in connection with the newly acquired Polish provinces, but in consequence of the battle of Jena (1806) he lost this office, and remained in very needy circumstances until 1809, when he was summoned to St. Petersburg by Alexander I, to fill the post of court councillor, the professorship of oriental languages and philosophy at the Alexander-Nevski Academy, and finally minister to the Court of St. James (Britain). This office, however, he was soon obliged to resign, owing to his alleged atheistic tendencies, but he was subsequently nominated a member of the legislative commission by the Emperor.\n\nIn 1815 he went with his family to Sarepta, where he joined the Moravian community and again became strongly orthodox. This cost him the loss of his salary, but it was restored to him upon his return in 1817. In November 1820, he was appointed consistorial president of the evangelical communities at Saratov and subsequently became chief superintendent of the Lutheran communities in St. Petersburg. In recognition of his important services to Hungary as a historian, he was in 1831 elected a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He died at St. Petersburg.\n\nFessler was a voluminous writer, and during his life exercised great influence; but, with the possible exception of the history of Hungary, none of his books has any value now. He did not pretend to any critical treatment of his materials, and most of his historical works are practically historical novels. He did much, however, to make the study of history popular. His works are all written in German.\n\nHis most important works are:\n\n"

Selected in the third group of NASA astronauts in 1963, he was killed a year later in the crash of a T-38 jet, marking the first fatality among the NASA Astronaut Corps. At the time of his death, he held the rank of captain.\n\nBorn in Haverford, Pennsylvania, on February 18, 1930, Freeman was named after the man who raised his father (Theodore Cullen Donovan), as well as his maternal grandfather (Thomas Cordy Wilson). He was one of five children. Raised in Lewes, Delaware, he attended Lewes Elementary School from 1936 to 1944. His father was a farmer and his brother a carpenter, and it seemed as if he would also have a blue collar career. When Freeman and his brother were young, they saved up money so they could take plane rides. He also was a part-time worker, helping to refuel the planes and work on them. He spent most of his money on flying lessons, and with over 450 hours of flying on his training record, earned his pilot's license by the age of 16. \"I sort of grew up at the airport,\" Freeman said.\n\nFreeman played baseball and football in high school. While playing football, he was hit hard and his teeth were knocked out of alignment. He was the president of the school's student and the local chapter of the National Honor Society; he graduated as an honors student ranked third in his class in 1948.\n\nHe was a Boy Scout and he earned the rank of First Class.\n\nDuring his senior year of high school, Freeman completed the application to the U.S. Naval Academy. He passed the scholarship portion, but failed the medical portion due to his crooked teeth. He was told if he straightened them out he would be accepted the next year.\n\nDuring that year, Freeman attended the University of Delaware at Newark to further his education. He also made some money by spotting schools of fish for local fishermen. Freeman had an operation to fix his teeth, which included grinding his teeth down, then wore braces for several months to finish the effort. He was admitted to the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1953 on June 17, 1949. Freeman graduated from Annapolis in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 1960, he received a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Michigan.\n\nFreeman elected to enter the U.S. Air Force and took flight training at Hondo Air Force Base and Bryan Air Force Base, Texas and at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. He was awarded his pilot wings in February 1955, shortly after being promoted to first lieutenant, then served in the Pacific and at George Air Force Base, California. He was promoted to captain in June 1960 while pursuing his master's degree at the University of Michigan and then went to Edwards Air Force Base, California, in February 1960 as an aerospace engineer.\n\nFreeman graduated from both the Air Force's Experimental Test Pilot School (Class 62A) and Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class IV) courses. He elected to serve with the Air Force. His last Air Force assignment was as a flight test aeronautical engineer and experimental flight test instructor at the ARPS at Edwards AFB in the Mojave Desert.\n\nFreeman served primarily in performance flight testing and stability testing areas; he logged more than 3,300 hours flying time, including more than 2,400 hours in jet aircraft. Freeman was one of the third group of astronauts selected by NASA in October 1963 and was assigned the responsibility of aiding the development of boosters.\n\nOn the morning of October 31, 1964, after a delay caused by fog, Freeman piloted a T-38A Talon from St. Louis to Houston. He was returning from McDonnell training facilities in St. Louis and crashed during final approach to landing at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston. There were reports of geese due to the fog, one of which flew into the port-side air intake of his NASA-modified T-38 jet trainer, causing the engine to flame out. Flying shards of Plexiglas entered the jet engine during the crash.\n\nFreeman attempted to land on the runway, but realized he was too short and might hit military housing. He banked away from the runway and ejected. The jet had nosed down a considerable amount, and he ejected nearly horizontally. Freeman's parachute did not deploy in time, and he died upon impact with the ground. His skull was fractured and he had severe chest injuries.\n\nFreeman was survived by his wife Faith Clark Freeman and one daughter, Faith Huntington. Faith Freeman first heard of her husband's death when a reporter came to her house: NASA subsequently ensured that in the case of future astronaut deaths, their families were informed by other astronauts as quickly as possible. He was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. Five astronauts were pallbearers at the funeral.\n\nThe Clear Lake City-County Freeman Branch Library of the Harris County Public Library and Houston Public Library systems is named in memory of Freeman. An artificial island off Long Beach is also named for him. This is one of the four \"Astronaut Islands\" built in Long Beach Harbor during the late 1960s as unsinkable platforms for oil drilling; the others were named Grissom, White and Chaffee, in honor of the astronauts killed in the Apollo 1 fire. A crater on the far side of the Moon was temporarily named Freeman crater by the Apollo 8 crew. The Theodore C. Freeman Highway in Lewes, Delaware, an approach road to the Cape May\u2013Lewes Ferry which carries U.S. Route 9, was named after him by a resolution of the Delaware Senate on December 21, 1965. A plaque commemorating Freeman was unveiled at the Lewes terminal of the Cape May\u2013Lewes Ferry on June 18, 2014, with Governor Jack Markell and family members of Freeman in attendance at the ceremony.\n\nOriana Fallaci's \"If the Sun Dies\", a book on the early days of the American space program, features an account of Freeman.\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Johan Georg Forchhammer (26 July 1794 \u2013 14 December 1865) was a Danish mineralogist and geologist.\n\nForchhammer was born at Husum, Schleswig. He studied at the universities of Kiel and Copenhagen from 1815 to 1818.\n\nForchhammer then joined Hans Christian \u00d8rsted and Lauritz Esmarch in their mineralogical exploration of Bornholm, and took a considerable share in the labors of the expedition. In 1820 he obtained his doctoral degree by a chemical treatise \"De mangano\", and immediately after set out on a journey through England, Scotland and the Faroe Islands. In 1823 he was appointed lecturer at Copenhagen University on chemistry and mineralogy; in 1829 he obtained a similar post in the newly established polytechnic school; and in 1831 he was appointed professor of mineralogy in the university, and in 1848 became curator of the geological museum.\n\nFrom 1835 to 1837 he made many contributions to the geological survey of Denmark. On the death of Hans Christian \u00d8rsted in 1851, he succeeded him as director of the polytechnic school and secretary of the Academy of Sciences. In 1850 he began with Japetus Steenstrup and Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae various anthropological publications which gained a high reputation. As a public instructor Forchhammer held a high place and contributed potently to the progress of his favorite studies in his native country. He interested himself in such practical questions as the introduction of gas into Copenhagen, the establishment of the fire-brigade at Rosenborg and the boring of artesian wells.\n\nIn 1865, Johan Georg Forchhammer conjectured that the ratio of major salts in samples of seawater from various locations was constant. This constant ratio is known as Forchhammer's Principle, or the Principle of Constant Proportions. Forchhhammer's theory was proven correct in 1884 by Prof William Dittmar following extensive analysis of sea-water samples taken during the Challenger expedition.\n\nAmong his more important works are \"L\u00e6rebog i. de enkelte Radicalers Chemi\" (1842); \"Danmarks geognostiske Forhold\" (1835); \"Om de Bornholmske Kulformationer\" (1836); \"Dit myere Kridt i Danmark\" (1847); \"Bidrag til Skildringer af Danmarks geographiske Forhold i deres Afh\u00e6ngighed af Landets indre geognostiske Bygning\" (1858). A list of his contributions to scientific periodicals, Danish, English and German, will be found in the Catalogue of Scientific Papers published by the Royal Society of London. One of the most interesting and most recent is \"On the Constitution of Sea Water at Different Depths and in Different Latitudes\", in the \"Proceedings of the Roy. Soc.\" xii. (1862-1863).\n\nHe was a Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog, and was a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters from 1825. In 1863, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He died at Copenhagen.\n\nHe was the brother of August Friedrich Wilhelm Forchhammer, father of Johannes Nicolai Georg Forchhammer, and grandfather of Johannes Georg Forchhammer.\n\nForchhammer married twice. He married Louise Christiane Fugl (1804\u20131831)m a daughter of \"kancellir\u00e5d\" U. N. Fugl (1768 \u2013 1817), in 1826. She died in 1831 and he then married her half-sister Emilie Mariane Fugl (1815 \u2013 1882). They lived in the Professor's House at N\u00f8rregade 8-10 in Copenahgen from 1833 and until his death in 1865.\n\nForchhammer's son Johannes Forchhammer (20 Narcg 1827 \u2013 18 July 1908), the only child from his first marriage, was a linguist and headmaster of Aalborg Cathedral School and Herlufsholm. Gis second marriage was without children.\n\nForchhammer died on 14. December 1865 and is buried in Assistens Cemetery.\n\nForchhammer was a member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters from 1825. He was awarded the Order of the Dannebrog in 1939 and was created Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1860.\n\n\n"

    "title": "Sidney Merlin",
    "text": "Sidney Louis Walter Merlin (, April 26, 1856 \u2013 1952) was a British botanist and sports shooter. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics and the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens.\n\nHis family had lived in Greece since the 1830s, where his father, Charles William Louis Merlin, was British Consul at Piraeus. His mother, Isabella (n\u00e9e Green) was an important figure in the British community in Athens. He was the Ionian Bank's agent at Piraeus/Athens from March 1853, and subsequently became, from autumn 1865 the bank's general inspector in Greece while continuing to be its agent at Athens and, from May 1890, a director in London of the bank. Sidney was born in Piraeus, and married Zaira Theotokis, the daughter of the Corfiot Prime Minister Georgios Theotokis. He later divorced her and married Katia, a Greek by birth whose aristocratic family had lived in Russia before the revolution. Edwin, their only child, served in the Royal Air Force in England during the Second World War. The Merlins were large landowners in Corfu, Crete, Lamia and Attica.\n\nIn the 1896 Olympics, Merlin competed in four of the five events. In the military rifle, he placed tenth with 1,156 points. His first (of four) string of 10 shots resulted in a score of 477. His score and place in the free rifle are unknown, but he did not win a medal. After two out of the five strings of 6 shots in the military pistol event, Merlin quit the competition. Similarly, he did not finish the rapid fire pistol event. He also participated in the men's trap shooting at the 1900 Paris Games, where he came joint seventh with five other athletes. At the 1906 Games, he participated in all shooting events, coming first and third in the men's trap, double shot and single shot.\n\nAs the Germans approached Athens during World War II, Sidney Merlin and his second wife, Katia, moved to the Merlin estate on Crete, a large mansion dating back to Venetian times. The mansion, known as Bella Capina (Pelakpaina in some spellings) also provided a residence for King George II, and meeting rooms for the Greek War Cabinet and government for several months. This ended abruptly when the German aerial invasion of the island began. The King and Prime Minister, having been warned in advance, left the day before the invasion. This is historically interesting, as it is one of the very few occasions when information from Bletchley Park, where German intelligence was decoded by the British, was given to non-British individuals. Sidney and Katia remained, with the task of keeping the house running as if the King were still in residence. When the German advance was within shooting distance, Sidney, Katia and a small entourage of other British household members, fled on foot, making an arduous crossing of the island to the southern village of Sphakia, where they were rescued by the British destroyer, HMS Napier, and taken to Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nIn Greece, Sidney Merlin is best known for two botanological achievements. In ca. 1925, he introduced the \"Washington Navel\" orange variety to his estate in Corfu. To this day, it is known in Greece as \"Merlin\". He also introduced the kumquat tree, which is used in Corfu to make the kumquat sweet, one of the specialties of Corfiot cuisine, and the Butter of Corfu (\"\u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf \u039a\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2\").\n\n"

    "title": "Brissago",
    "text": "Brissago is a municipality in the district of Locarno in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Brissago lies on the western shore of Lake Maggiore and includes the Brissago Islands.\n\nAn ax and ceramic pieces from the Neolithic era as well as Roman coins and other finds, discovered in 1846 in Brenscino, indicate that the area was prehistorically settled. In 1863, during the construction of the main road, some graves were discovered. Fragments of a grave stele with inscriptions were built into the (now destroyed) Church of San Pancrazio on Isola Grande.\n\nBrissago is first mentioned in 1289 as \"Brixago\". It used to be known by the German name of \"Brisa\", though this is no longer used.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the fortunes of the village were closely tied to those of the parish and court of Cannobio in the county of Stazzona. After the fragmentation of the county in the 11th-12th Centuries, Brissago was on the outskirts of the areas of influence of Milan and Como. Its relative isolation allowed to develop into an Imperial community with great autonomy. By the middle of the 13th Century it had its own village law, with the first version appearing in 1289. The community consisted of the three village cooperatives (\"vicinia\") Costa di Piodina, Costa di Mezzo and Costa di Dentro, which were probably in turn were divided into \"degagne\". The local council selected three community leaders (Consoli), one for each \"vicinia\" who were supported by council members and some lower officials.\n\nThe entire municipality was ruled by a \"Podest\u00e0\", who was initially appointed by the Visconti family of Milan. The \"Podest\u00e0\" was recruited from 1342 until the end of Old Swiss Confederacy rule in 1798, from among the Orelli family, a noble family in Locarno. Also, in 1342, the Visconti added Brissago into the \"capitaneria\" of Lake Maggiore. Between 1439-1520 the community had to help finance the military spending of Locarno, despite maintaining a certain degree of autonomy under the aegis of Count Rusca. The 16th Century was marked by feuds between the Rainaldi and Baciocchi families. Following the creation of an independent republic in Brissago in 1520, it became an Associate of the Swiss Confederation. It became part of the Bailiwick of Locarno, but remained a special judicial district with its own \"Podest\u00e0\". Under the Helvetic Republic it was part of the district of Locarno. Then in 1803, it became an independent political municipality in the new Canton of Ticino. During the Italian \"Risorgimento\" it was a refuge and center of weapons smuggling and underground literature for the Lombard refugees.\nThe village church was under the authority of the diocese of Milan as part of the old parish of Cannobio. As part of the diocese of Milan, the Ambrosian Rite was followed in the church. The Church of SS Pietro e Paolo is first mentioned in the 13th Century. It was parish church in 1335 and in 1865 it was awarded the title of a priory church. The existing building is from the 16th to the 17th century, and it was restored in 1961. The island of Sant'Apollinare was under the Ambrosian Rite, while on the Isola Grande (Church of S. Pancrazio), which belonged to the parish church of Locarno and the territory of Ascona, the Roman Rite was followed. On this island in the 13th Century, the Humiliati order founded a monastery. After the order was suppressed in 1571, their property was given to the hospital in Locarno. In 1885, the Baroness Antonietta Saint-L\u00e9ger acquired the two islands and built a botanical garden and villa on Isola Grande. The villa turned into a cultural meeting place. In 1927, the ownership passed to Max Emden from Hamburg, who built a new palace. In 1949 the islands were acquired under joint ownership: the canton of Ticino, the municipalities of Brissago, Ascona and Ronco sopra Ascona, the Swiss Heritage Society and the Swiss Federation for Nature Conservation. Since 1950, the botanical garden on Isola Grande has been a public garden.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the majority of the population worked in agriculture and animal husbandry. The shoreline and hill dwellers operated some fishing boats and some commerce and trade. Already in the 13th Century there were mills, hammer mills and sawmills, as well as later lime kilns in the village. Starting in the 15th Century much of the population emigrated to Milan and Tuscany. The later immigrants from Brissago were traditionally cooks and hoteliers. In the 18th Century some families moved to Locarno and Ascona, where they gained a certain reputation. The opening of a spinning mill in 1854, which became two years later a tobacco factory, gradually changed, the socio-economic structure of the municipality. In 1888 a new factory was built, and in the first decades of the 20th Century industrial activity reached its peak, with more than 600 people, mostly women, employed in tobacco processing. During this time, the municipality also began to develop into a resort town with many second homes and hotels. This change accelerated in 1907 with the construction of the Grande Albergo hotel, which was demolished in 1993. After 1970, the services sector was the most important part of the local economy. The growth in the 1960s and 1970s led the town to grow up the hillsides and become a contiguous residential area.\nBrissago has an area, , of . Of this area, or 7.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 66.6% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 7.0% is settled (buildings or roads), or 1.8% is either rivers or lakes and or 19.2% is unproductive land.\n\nOf the built up area, housing and buildings made up 5.3% and transportation infrastructure made up 1.2%.

It is bordered by the Valmara and Valle di Creda and consists of three mountainous shoreline sections. The three sections are divided by the Valli di Ponte and the Sacro Monte. It lies on the road to Ascona along the Italian border. It consists of the village of Brissago and the sections of Caccio, Cadogno, Cartogna, Gadero, Incella, Madonna di Ponte, Nevedone, Noveledo, Piazza, Piodina, Porta, Rossorino, Tecetto and the two islands Isola Grande and Sant'Apollinare. The 13 sections are scattered in the hills on roads leading to Mount Gridone (). On the other side of Mount Gridone is the Centovalli.\n\nRegular boat service and hydrofoil service runs from Locarno to Brissago via Ascona and the Isole di Brissago (Brissago Islands) on which there is a botanical reserve with coffee plants and peacocks taking advantage of the odd sub-tropical zone.\n\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is \"Argent a cross gules and in canton St. George riding a horse toward sinister argent cloaked gules killing a dragon vert.\" St. George refers to 24 April 1520 (St. George's day) when Brissago decided to be put under the protection of the Swiss.\n\nBrissago has a population () of . , 18.3% of the population are resident foreign nationals.

An anthropomorphic roadrunner, Rowdy is based upon the Greater Roadrunner.\n\nThe origin of Rowdy dates back to 1977, when the Student Representative Assembly (the forerunner to the modern Student Government Association) was openly debating the university's mascot. An original vote, which favored \"The Armadillos\" and \"The Stars\" was declared null and void by the SRA, making way for a second campus-wide poll. The second election was hotly contested between \"The Roadrunners\" and \"The Armadillos\"\u2014with vigorous support on either side. after the final vote, the roadrunner was announced as the official mascot of UTSA at a bonfire celebration later that year. \nOn March 1, 2008, UTSA unveiled the new Rowdy and UTSA logos at the homecoming men's basketball game vs. Texas A&M University\u2013Corpus Christi. Many students and administrators at UTSA thought the previous Rowdy bore too much resemblance to the Kansas Jayhawk.\n"

    "text": "\"King Cotton\" is a slogan that summarized the strategy used before the American Civil War (of 1861\u20131865) by pro-secessionists in the southern states (the future Confederate States of America) to claim the feasibility of secession and to prove there was no need to fear a war with the northern states. The theory held that control over cotton exports would make a proposed independent Confederacy economically prosperous, would ruin the textile industry of New England, and\u2014most importantly\u2014would force the United Kingdom and perhaps France to support the Confederacy militarily because their industrial economies depended on Southern cotton. The slogan, widely believed throughout the South, helped in mobilizing support for secession: by February 1861, the seven states whose economies were based on cotton plantations had all seceded and formed the Confederacy. Meanwhile, the other eight slave states, with little or no cotton production, remained in the Union.\n\nTo demonstrate the alleged power of King Cotton, Southern cotton merchants spontaneously refused to ship out their cotton in early 1861; it was not a government decision. By summer 1861, the Union Navy blockaded every major Confederate port and shut down over 95% of exports. Since the British mills had large stockpiles of cotton, they suffered no immediate injury from the embargo; indeed the value of their stockpiles soared. \n\nHowever, the British did not react to King Cotton, and they never intervened. For Britain to have intervened would have meant war with the U.S. and a cut-off of British food supplies: About one-fourth of Britain's food supplies came from the United States, and American warships could destroy much of British commerce while the Royal Navy was convoying ships full of cotton. On the other hand, Britain had already abolished slavery, and the public would not have tolerated the government militarily supporting a sovereignty upholding the ideals of slavery.\n\nConsequently, it proved a failure for the Confederacy, as the strategy did not succeed in making the new Confederate polity economically prosperous. The blockade prevented the earning of desperately needed gold. Most importantly, the false belief led to unrealistic assumptions that the war would be won through European intervention if only the Confederacy held out long enough.\n\nThe American South is known for its long, hot summers, and rich soils in river valleys, making it an ideal location for growing cotton. The many southern seaports and riverside docks allowed shipping cotton to remote destinations. By 1860, Southern plantations supplied 75% of the world's cotton, with shipments from Houston, New Orleans, Charleston, Mobile, Savannah, and a few other ports.\n\nThe insatiable European demand for cotton was a result of the Industrial Revolution which created the machinery and factories to process raw cotton into clothing that was better and cheaper than a handmade product. European and New England purchases soared from 720,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850, to nearly 5 million in 1860. Cotton production renewed demand for slavery after the tobacco market had declined in the late 18th century. The more cotton was grown, the more slaves were needed to harvest the crops. By 1860, on the eve of the American Civil War, cotton accounted for almost 60% of American exports, representing a total value of nearly $200 million a year.\n\nCotton's central place in the national economy and its international importance led Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina to make a famous boast in 1858:\n\nConfederate leaders had made little effort to ascertain the views of European industrialists or diplomats until the Confederacy sent diplomats James Mason and John Slidell in November 1861. That led to a diplomatic blowup in the Trent Affair.\n\nWhen war broke out, the Confederate people, acting spontaneously without government direction, held their cotton at home, watching prices soar and an economic crisis hit Britain and New England, causing a backlash with British public opinion. Even if Britain did intervene, it would mean war with the United States, as well as loss of the American market, loss of American grain supplies, risk to Canada, and much of the British merchant marine, all in the slim promise of getting more cotton. Besides that, in the spring of 1861, warehouses in Europe were bulging with surplus cotton, which later soared in price. So the cotton interests made their profits without a war. The Union imposed a naval blockade, closing all Confederate ports to normal traffic; consequently, the South was unable to move 95% of its cotton. Yet, some cotton was slipped out by blockade runners, or through Mexico. Cotton diplomacy, advocated by the Confederate diplomats James M. Mason and John Slidell, completely failed because the Confederacy could not deliver its cotton, and the British economy was robust enough to absorb a depression in textiles from 1862\u201364.\n\nAs Union armies moved into cotton regions of the South in 1862, the U.S. acquired all the cotton available, and sent it to Northern textile mills or sold it to Europe. Meanwhile, cotton production increased in India by 70% and also increased in Egypt. Between 1860 and 1870, Brazilian annual cotton exports rose 400%, from 12,000 to 60,000 tonnes.\n\nWhen war broke out, the Confederates refused to allow the export of cotton to Europe. The idea was that this cotton diplomacy would force Europe to intervene. However, European states did not intervene, and following Abraham Lincoln's decision to impose a Union blockade, the South was unable to market its millions of bales of cotton. The production of cotton increased in other parts of the world, such as India and Egypt, to meet the demand, and new profits in cotton were among the motives of the Russian conquest of Central Asia. A British-owned newspaper, \"The Standard\" of Buenos Aires, in cooperation with the Manchester Cotton Supply Association succeeded in encouraging Argentinian farmers to drastically increase production of cotton in that country and export it to the United Kingdom.\n\nSurdam (1998) asks, \"Did the world demand for American-grown raw cotton fall during the 1860s, even though total demand for cotton increased?\" Previous researchers have asserted that the South faced stagnating or falling demand for its cotton. Surdam's more complete model of the world market for cotton, combined with additional data, shows that the reduction in the supply of American-grown cotton induced by the Civil War distorts previous estimates of the state of demand for cotton. In the absence of the drastic disruption in the supply of American-grown cotton, the world demand for such cotton would have remained strong.\n\nStanley Lebergott (1983) shows the South blundered during the war because it clung too long to faith in King Cotton. Because the South's long-range goal was a world monopoly of cotton, it devoted valuable land and slave labor to growing cotton instead of urgently needed foodstuffs.\n\nIn the end, \"King Cotton\" proved to be a delusion that misled the Confederacy into a hopeless war that it ended up losing.\n\n\n"
