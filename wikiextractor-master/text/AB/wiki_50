She was a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1994 to 2008, representing the electorate of Braitling. She was initially elected as a representative of the Country Liberal Party, serving in that role from 1994 until 2001, but retained her seat as an independent after being disendorsed before the 2001 election. She was the Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1997 to 1999 and again from 2001 to 2005. Braham also served as a minister in the Stone government from 1999 to 2000.\n\nBraham was born in Victoria, and initially trained as an infant teacher, graduating from the Melbourne Teachers College in 1958. She subsequently spent four years teaching in Melbourne, during which time she married her late husband, Graeme, in 1960. When he finished his military service in 1962, they decided to leave Melbourne and move north. After a short period spent opal mining in Andamooka, South Australia, they settled in Alice Springs. Braham continued working as a teacher for many years, culminating in an eight-year stint as the principal of the Braitling School. While continuing as principal, she also served as an alderman on the Alice Springs Town Council from 1988 to 1994, and completed a Graduate Diploma in Public Sector Executive Management at the Northern Territory University.\n\nIn 1994, long-serving Country Liberal Party minister Roger Vale announced his resignation as the member for the electorate of Braitling, and Braham decided to nominate in the preselection contest to decide his replacement. She had some difficulty in winning pre-selection, at one point seeking the advice of soon-to-be Chief Minister Shane Stone, but eventually prevailed. As Braitling has usually been a very safe seat for the CLP, Braham was easily elected, and subsequently became the first woman ever to be elected to the Assembly from central Australia.\n\nBraham served out a relatively uneventful first term as a backbencher, but when she attempted to recontest her seat at the 1997 election, she faced an unexpected preselection challenge from local policeman John Elferink. She prevailed, however, and Elferink was given MacDonnell as consolation. She found herself promoted to her first parliamentary appointment immediately after the election, when Stone nominated her as the first ever female Speaker of the Assembly.\n\nBraham's first term as Speaker was not particularly eventful, although some of her rulings from the chair caused a significant falling out with Stone. When Stone faced a leadership crisis in February 1999 and subsequently resigned, it was widely rumoured that Braham's opposition had played a part in his downfall. Stone was replaced as Chief Minister by Denis Burke. Within a week of Burke taking over, he promoted Braham to cabinet as Minister for Local Government, Minister for Housing, Minister for Aboriginal Development and Minister for central Australia, replacing Eric Poole in the ministry. Terry McCarthy succeeded her as Speaker.\n\nBraham's five years as a backbencher and Speaker had generally been uneventful, but her term as a minister saw mixed results. She was quite prominent as Minister for Central Australia, maintaining a high profile and playing a role in negotiations surrounding the construction of the Adelaide-Darwin railway, overseeing the initiation of \"Alice in 10\", a major urban renewal project in Alice Springs, and agitating successfully for the construction of a convention centre in Alice Springs, among other achievements.\n\nThis contrasted with difficulties in both of her other portfolios. She found herself under attack over the state of public housing in the Territory, and struggled to deal with the substandard living conditions in many remote indigenous communities. There were also some concerns hanging over her performance in central Australia, however, with the \"Alice Springs News\" once labelling her the \"Minister for Official Openings\", and suggesting that she was proving ineffective.\n\nWith the 2001 election on the distant horizon, Braham made clear her intention to run again. She was initially preselected by the Alice Springs branch of the Country Liberal Party for a third term in Braitling. However, the other decisions of the branch proved to be quite controversial – Elferink was dropped, and prominent Araluen hopeful Jodeen Carney was overlooked. As a result, Elferink wrote a letter to the party's Central Council complaining about the situation, reportedly suggesting that Braham had used proxy votes to stack the Alice Springs branch pre-selection committee, and that five delegates, instead of being elected, had been appointed by Stuart branch president, MP aspirant and Braham staffer Tony Bohning.\n\nThe fallout from Elferink's letter was immense. On 25 November 2000, the CLP's central council held a closed-doors meeting, and in a very rare move that was dubbed \"the Night of the Long Knives\" by the \"Alice Springs News\", overruled most of the Alice Springs branch's preselection decisions. Amidst a swath of other changes, the Council reinstated Elferink, selected Carney for Araluen, and overturned Braham's preselection. Peter Harvey, who had previously been chosen over Carney in Araluen, replaced Braham as CLP candidate in Braitling. In one sudden twist, Braham's career in the legislature appeared to be over. While the CLP had dropped sitting MPs before, Braham was the first sitting CLP minister to lose her preselection.\n\nBurke initially refused to comment on whether Braham would remain in the ministry while serving out her term. However, he sacked Braham from cabinet three days later, with her portfolios being given to backbencher Dr Richard Lim. Speculation then turned to Braham's future; specifically, whether she would contest the seat as an independent. She left the question open for more than two months, until Burke set a deadline—unless Braham announced her intentions by 7 February 2001, she would be banned from the CLP party room. On the day of the deadline, Braham resigned from the CLP, and announced that she would serve out her term as an independent. While it was briefly suggested that Braham would still resign at the election, potentially making way for Alice Springs Mayor Fran Kilgariff to run as an independent, it soon became clear that Braham intended to attempt to retain her seat.\n\nThough she no longer represented the Country Liberal Party, Braham remained an active strongly social conservative voice in the Assembly, as was illustrated when she vocally opposed the holding of a gay and lesbian festival in Alice Springs. However, it was not long before she also broke with her old party and began taking issue with a number of their decisions, such as when she accused the government of neglecting Alice Springs over sports funding. She was also strongly critical of both parties for, she claimed, neglecting areas south of the Berrimah Line.\n\nFrom the moment Braham declared her intention to run for another term, most analysts tipped that she was in with a strong chance. Shortly before the election, prominent conservative publication \"The Bulletin\" suggested that Braham could have stopped campaigning six months before and still been easily re-elected. The eventual result was not as decisive, with Braham narrowly finishing second on first-preference votes of 34%, but she was easily elected on the preferences of the Labor Party.\n\nThere was initially some likelihood of a hung parliament, which would have meant that an ALP government would need the support of either Braham or fellow independent Gerry Wood to form government, while the CLP would have needed the support of both. Had this situation arisen, it was widely expected that Braham would nevertheless have supported the CLP, despite her anger at being turfed by her own party. However, the point was made moot when ALP candidate Matthew Bonson won an extremely narrow victory in Millner, allowing the ALP to win government by one seat. While Bonson's win meant that Labor could have appointed one of its MPs as Speaker, new Chief Minister Clare Martin chose to offer Braham the position, which Braham accepted.\n\nBraham's second term as Speaker was only marginally more eventful than her first. As both an Alice Springs MP and as Speaker, Braham was instrumental in arranging the first ever sitting of the Assembly in Alice Springs in 2003, which was held in the Convention Centre she had agitated for five years earlier – though she attracted some attention by calling for the resignations of MPs Chris Burns and John Elferink after a highly publicised clash in the Assembly during the Alice Springs sittings. She suspended them both in 2005 as well. She also helped arrange a second round of Alice Springs sittings in 2005. While these were generally acclaimed as being successful, she has also attracted some criticism for her actions as Speaker – most notably when she angered disabled groups by overriding previous arrangements and banning a nude art exhibition dealing with disabled people that was due to be held at Parliament House.\n\nBraham's second stint as Speaker meant that although she was now an independent MP, she was still bound by convention to refrain from debate on most political issues and could not vote in the Assembly except in the extremely rare event of a tie. On a few occasions, she temporarily stood down as Speaker to speak as a regular member or move legislation, as seen in her 2002 Private Member's Bill concerning container deposit legislation and again in March 2005, when she used parliamentary privilege to claim that the head of the Alice Springs hospital had been appointed in breach of regulations (which she was later forced to retract).\n\nBraham ran for another term in parliament at the 2005 election, facing the new endorsed CLP candidate, former councillor and local party figure Michael Jones. Braham had been widely tipped to win another term, but ended up facing a much stronger challenge than most had predicted; the result was not known for several days after the election, and while Braham was eventually declared the winner, she suffered a swing of 4.6 percent. While she had not expressed a preference either way whether she wanted to remain Speaker (in contrast to Deputy Speaker Gerry Wood, who had made clear that he wanted to retain the position), it was widely expected that Braham would continue in office after the election if she retained her seat. However, with Labor winning a comprehensive victory, it had little incentive to keep an independent in the Speaker's chair. Accordingly, Labor nominated former minister Jane Aagaard for the position instead.\n\nBraham has two children, one son and one daughter. She was married to husband Graeme for 41 years, but was widowed in October 2003 when he died unexpectedly of a heart attack.\n\nBraham hosts a weekly radio program called \"Share Your Story\" on 8CCC.\n"}
{"id": "1977435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977435", "title": "Moralia", "text": "Moralia\n\nThe Moralia ( \"Ethika\"; loosely translated as \"Morals\" or \"Matters relating to customs and mores\") of the 1st-century Greek scholar Plutarch of Chaeronea is an eclectic collection of 78 essays and transcribed speeches. They provide insights into Roman and Greek life, but often are also timeless observations in their own right. Many generations of Europeans have read or imitated them, including Michel de Montaigne and the Renaissance Humanists and Enlightenment philosophers.\n\nThe \"Moralia\" include \"On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great\"—an important adjunct to his Life of the great general—\"On the Worship of Isis and Osiris\" (a crucial source of information on Egyptian religious rites), and \"On the Malice of Herodotus\" (which may, like the orations on Alexander's accomplishments, have been a rhetorical exercise), in which Plutarch criticizes what he sees as systematic bias in the \"Histories\" of Herodotus;.\" along with more philosophical treatises, such as \"On the Decline of the Oracles\", \"On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance\", \"On Peace of Mind\" and lighter fare, such as \"Odysseus and Gryllus\" (\"Bruta animalia ratione uti\"), a humorous dialog between Homer's Odysseus and one of Circe's enchanted pigs. The \"Moralia\" were composed first, while writing the Lives occupied much of the last two decades of Plutarch's own life.\n\nSome editions of the \"Moralia\" include several works now known to be pseudepigrapha: among these are the \"Lives of the Ten Orators\" (biographies of the Attic orators based on Caecilius of Calacte), \"On the Opinions of the Philosophers\", \"On Fate\", and \"On Music\". One \"Pseudo-Plutarch\" is held responsible for all of these works, though their authorship is unknown. Though the thoughts and opinions recorded are not Plutarch's and come from a slightly later era, they are all classical in origin and have value to the historian.\n\nSince the Stephanus edition of 1572, the \"Moralia\" have traditionally been arranged in 14 books, as in the following list that includes the English, the original Greek, and the Latin title:\n\nThe only surviving manuscript containing all seventy-eight of the extant treatises included in Plutarch's \"Moralia\" dates to sometime shortly after 1302 AD.\n\n\nIn his essay \"The Symposiacs,\" Plutarch discusses the famous problem of the chicken and the egg. Although Plutarch was not the first person to discuss the problem (Aristotle had already discussed it hundreds of years before Plutarch), he was the first person to put the question into its modern form.\n\nIncluded in \"Moralia\" is letter addressed by Plutarch to his wife, bidding her not give way to excessive grief at the death of their two-year-old daughter, who was named Timoxena after her mother. In the letter, Plutarch expresses his belief in reincarnation:\n\nMind or Nous (, Greek: ) is a philosophical term for intellect. In \"Moralia\", Plutarch agrees with Plato that the soul is more divine than the body while \"nous\" is more divine than the soul. The mix of soul and body produces pleasure and pain; the conjunction of mind and soul produces reason which is the cause or the source of virtue and vice.\n\n\n"}

Renshaw in command.\n\n\"Westfield\" departed New York on 22 February 1862, bound for Key West, Florida, to join Comdr. David Dixon Porter's Mortar Flotilla. That unit, however, departed Key West on 3 March before \"Westfield's\" arrival. She, therefore, did not join the flotilla until her arrival at the Passes of the Mississippi River on 18 March. For the next three weeks, she assisted and in their efforts to cross the bar at Pass an Outre and enter the Mississippi River.\n\nThat mission finally succeeded on 8 April 1862, and \"Westfield\" began duty covering a coastal survey party developing more precise maps of the lower Mississippi for the assault on Forts Jackson and St. Philip. On 13 April 1862, she received orders to proceed upriver and engage two Confederate gunboats. After two shots from her Parrott rifle, the two Confederate ships retired to the protection of the guns of Fort Jackson where they joined six other Confederate gunboats. Undaunted, \"Westfield\" closed the range and opened fire once more. That brief cannonade broke the shaft of and damaged her so severely that her crew later had to abandon and sink her.\nBetween 14 April and 24 April 1862, she supported Porter's Mortar Flotilla during the bombardment of the two Confederate forts in preparation for Flag Officer David Farragut's run between them to New Orleans, Louisiana. That event occurred on 24 April 1862, but \"Westfield\" did not participate directly. Rather, she remained with the mortar boats and continued to support them and supply ammunition. Early in the summer of 1862, \"Westfield\" moved upriver with the Mortar Flotilla — to a point just below Vicksburg, Mississippi. There she resumed her duties in support of the mortars during the first campaign against the Confederate stronghold.\n\nLate in July and early in August 1862, the ship made her way back down the Mississippi via Baton Rouge and New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico. She then took up duty blockading the coast of Texas as a unit of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. On 4 October 1862, \"Westfield\" led a unit composed of , , , and in a successful assault on the city of Galveston, Texas, which capitulated formally on the 9 October 1862. She remained at Galveston until 1 January 1863 and was flagship of the six-ship U.S. Navy force there when, during the successful Confederate liberation of the city in the Battle of Galveston, she ran aground on a sandbar in Galveston Harbor while the Union ships were under attack by two Confederate States Army warships, the tugboat CS \"Neptune\" and the gunboat CS \"Bayou City\". She was blown up to forestall her almost certain capture by Confederate forces. Her commanding officer, Commander William B. Renshaw (1816–1863), who also was the commander of the U.S. Navy force off Galveston, and a boat crew died when the explosives detonated sooner than expected.\n\nAs of 2007, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named \"Westfield.\"\n\nOn 18 November 2009 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began several weeks of recovery operations to retrieve artifacts. Items recovered are destined for study at the Conservation Research Lab at Texas A&M University. \"Westfield's\" largest cannon, the 9-inch Dahlgren, was recovered along with five cannonballs from a depth of 47 ft near the merge point of the Texas City Ship Channel and the Houston Ship Channel. The Dahlgren cannon is said to be the centerpiece of the recovered artifacts, which were brought to College Station and will be kept at the Conservation Research Lab on Texas A&M's Riverside Campus. The cannon was placed in an electrolysis bath for up to two years to remove chlorides and preserve the metal, according to Donny Hamilton, head of the Texas A&M anthropology department. The cannon was moved to the Texas City Museum, where it will be housed for the foreseeable future. The Museum dedicated the USS Westfield Exhibit March 2, 2017.\n\nOnce the archaeology project completes, the US Army Corps of Engineers begins a $71 million dredging effort of the waterway.\n\n\n \n"}

It is separated from the southwest fringe of Trowbridge only by the Southwick Country Park, which consists of of open fields. The majority of the village lies south of the A361, which runs through the village, linking Trowbridge with Frome.\n\nThe parish includes the hamlets of Hoggington and Hoopers Pool.\n\nThe Somerset border lies approximately one mile southwest of Southwick village. Nearby villages are Rode, about to the southwest, and North Bradley, one mile to the east.\n\nA tributary of the River Biss, the Lambrok Stream, which is fed from streams in the south and west of the parish, flows to the southeast of the village and then turns to form part of the parish's northeastern boundary with Trowbridge.\n\nSouthwick, together with North Bradley, was part of Steeple Ashton manor in Anglo-Saxon times. The area was part of the extensive Selwood Forest until 1300. Early landownwers included Humphrey Stafford (died 1413).\n\nSettlement at Southwick began in the early Middle Ages and grew with the woollen cloth industry, weavers working at home for Trowbridge clothiers; the population peaked in the early 19th century.\n\nA National School, with teacher's house, was built on the Frome Road in 1867 on land provided by Richard Penruddocke Long of Rood Ashton House. In Flemish bond brick with limestone dressings, the gothic-style building has a clock tower with a short octagonal stone spire. After enlargement in 1898 the school could accommodate 200. Children of all ages attended until 1931, when those aged 11 and over transferred to secondary schools in Trowbridge. In 1975 the Victorian school was replaced by a new building in the east of the village.\n\nUntil 1866, Southwick was part of North Bradley parish. In 1937 some 220 acres in the west of the parish, adjacent to the Somerset village of Rode and containing the small settlement of Rode Hill, was transferred to Rode parish.\n\nSouthwick was one of the earliest and largest Baptist centres in Wiltshire, beginning in the mid-17th century. A chapel linked to the Conigre church at Trowbridge stood near Bradley Common throughout the 18th century, and in 1709 another was built on the south side of Wynsome Street, which soon had a congregation of 300. A revival here led to the building of a replacement chapel in 1815, in red brick with stone dressings, under a slate roof. The two tiers of windows light the main hall and the gallery, and there is a sunken baptistery. An attached Sunday school, which at one time had 120 pupils, was rebuilt in the 1870s. The chapel continues in use. Nearby to the northwest, where the road crosses the Lambrok Stream, is an open-air baptistery, rebuilt in stone in 1937 and described by Historic England as \"a rare surviving example\", although Pevsner states the stonework to be of \"suburban character\".\n\nA breakaway group from the chapel congregation formed a society of strict Baptists and opened Providence Chapel, built in limestone ashlar, on Frome Road in 1861. The chapel closed in the late 20th century and is now a private house.\n\nParishioners attended the parish church of St Nicholas at North Bradley until an iron mission church was built in 1881; it was destroyed by fire in 1897. The parish church of St Thomas was built in 1899–1904 to designs of C.E. Ponting, in Gothic style using rock-faced limestone. The two-stage tower is surmounted by a shingled flèche. Inside is a wooden chancel screen in Arts and Crafts style, and an immersion tank for baptism, in keeping with Southwick's Baptist tradition.\n\nSouthwick Court Farmhouse, northwest of the village, is an L-shaped moated stone house from the 16th and 17th centuries, owned by the Longs of Whaddon from the late 17th century until the late 19th. It was probably a replacement for an earlier house owned by the Grenville family from the 13th century, the Stafford family in the 14th century, and the Willoughby family of Brook Hall in the 15th. In the Middle Ages there was a family chapel nearby, dedicated to St John the Baptist; this fell into disuse sometime after 1544 and the building was demolished in 1839.\n\nIn 1968 the house was recorded as Grade II* listed, as were the attached gatehouse and the 18th-century bridge.\n\nBrook House, southeast of the village, is a 17th-century farmhouse beside an early 16th-century stone-built range. The Poplars was built in about 1650 and re-faced with brick in about 1700. Manor Farmhouse, west of the village, was built in 1673.\n\nThe civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. The ward starts in the west at Southwick and then stretches east to West Ashton. The total ward population taken from the 2011 census was 4,444.\n\nThe village has a small primary school which is next to a large playing field. Southwick & North Bradley Scout Group have had their headquarters at the old school since 1978.\n\nThere are two main residential areas in the northeast of the village, opposite the Southwick Allotments and the 'Farmhouse Inn' pub. The estates are linked, and named Chantry Gardens and Fleur De Lys Drive. In 2011, a small cluster of houses was built north of Fleur De Lys Drive, linked to Fleur De Lys Drive via a short path; this development was named Greenleaze Close. The second large group of housing is located to the south and west of the playing field, and has short roads branching off Blind Lane and Wesley Lane (a road winding from Wynsome Street, between the A361 and North Bradley). These roads are named Southfield, Wesley Close and Orchard Drive. Housing was also developed off Church Street in the mid-2000s, designated The Mowlems and Swan Court.\n\n\n"}

Environmental groups and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have indicated that such alternative \"wet cleaning\" methods are better for the environment than perc, and proponents of wet cleaning state that these methods can be used without shrinking or otherwise damaging garments that typically require dry cleaning.\nIt is not the use of water that makes wet cleaning a safer method for cleaning clothes. Computer-controlled wet cleaning machines, special dryers, safe detergents and non-toxic spot removers are what make wet cleaning an environmentally sound method. Wet cleaning machines have controls that allow them to safely and efficiently clean a wide variety of garments in water. Detergents and spot removers are made of ingredients that are safer for workers and the environment, yet are as safe and effective at removing soils, stains and odors as dry cleaning solvents. Equipment, detergents and skill all contribute to successful wet cleaning. \n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), wet cleaning is the most environmentally sensitive professional method of garment cleaning. It does not use hazardous chemicals, it does not generate hazardous waste, nor does the process create air pollution and it reduces the potential for water and soil contamination. The specialized detergents and conditioner used in the wet clean process are milder than home laundry products. All of the products are disposed of down the drain and easily handled by the local waste water treatment facility. For professional cleaners, wet-cleaning is argued to offer several advantages, such as lowered costs for start-up capital, supplies, equipment and hazardous waste disposal, as well as less reliance on skilled labor. \n\nFrom American Dry Cleaner, \"74.7% of dry cleaners use wet cleaning when cleaning casual clothing and sportswear; specialty items, like draperies and gowns (42.3%); “business casual” or softly tailored clothing (38%); restoration work (25.4%); and tailored workwear (16.9%). \nSome clothing manufacturers may mislabel their clothing \"Dry Clean Only\", even though there is no \"reasonable basis\" for making the claim that the garment will be harmed if it is not dry cleaned.\n\n\n"}

They were built by Comeng and Clyde Engineering between 1987 and 1996.\n\nIn March 1985, the State Transport Authority (STA) awarded a tender for 20 diesel railcars (eight 3000 class units with a cab at each end and twelve 3100 class with a cab at one end only) to Comeng, Dandenong. The design was based on the stainless steel shell of the Comeng electric train then in production for Melbourne's Public Transport Corporation, but 2.3 metres longer and with only two doors per side. Because of a contractual requirement to maximise local content, the fit out was conducted at Comeng's Dry Creek facility. The first commenced testing in May 1987, entering service in November 1987. The eight 3000s were built first with the first 3100 class completed in mid-1988. The last entered service in December 1988.\n\nIn the original contract, there was an option to order 76 further examples. However Comeng came back to the STA with a significantly higher price, so the work was put out to tender and a contract for 50 awarded to Clyde Engineering in November 1989. Comeng concluded a deal to sell the 3000 class design and tooling. However by the time construction commenced, Comeng had sold its Dandenong plant to ABB who backed away from an agreement to hand over the jigs and tooling, so they were built between 1992 and 1996 by Clyde Engineering's Martin & King factory in Somerton, Victoria. \n\nAll were delivered with unpainted stainless steel offset by blue and orange stripes. In April 2002 the first was repainted by Bluebird Rail Operations in Adelaide Metro's yellow, blue and red. \n\nOriginally they operated on all Adelaide suburban lines, however since the electrification of the Seaford and Tonsley lines in 2014, they have been confined to the Belair, Gawler, Grange and Outer Harbor lines. They have on occasions ventured beyond the Adelaide metropolitan area, operating special services to Nuriootpa on the Barossa Valley line and Riverton on the Roseworthy-Peterborough line. These tours stopped in the mid 2000s.\n\nFollowing the 3000/3100 class life extension programme commencing in 2018, all 70 cars were repowered with Mercedes-Benz OM502LA series v8 engines.\n\nOnly one of the Axles per multiple unit are powered, originally with 2 Stromberg Electric Motors, which have now been replaced since the 2018 life extension.\n\nThe 3000 class bogies were built by Comeng and feature airbag secondary suspension. All 3000 class railcars are fitted with electro-magnetic track brakes, which are comparatively rare on trains, though they are commonly found on trams. These are operated separately from the normal mechanical and dynamic braking.\n\nTrains are equipped with automatic Scharfenberg couplers which are operated from the driver's cab. Coupling operations are sometimes performed at Adelaide station, requiring an extra staff member to flag the driver as well as to connect the safety chains. This feature allows sets of up to six cars to be formed.\n\nTwo headlights are mounted at the top of the car in the centre on driver's cab ends. There are no marker lights at the front; however, there are red marker lights for the rear located on the upper corners. There are metal steps up the side of the car to each door, but they are not used by passengers, however in emergency situations, they may be used to allow passengers to disembark from the train. They are illuminated by lights at night. All cars are air-conditioned.\n\nDuring late 2020, 50 out of 70 of the 3000/3100 railcars were taken out of service on the Gawler, Belair and Outer Harbor rail lines due to a fatal mechanical fault. These trains were out of service for 2 weeks while replacement parts were being ordered and installed, therefore forcing Adelaide Metro to move all affected train services to weekend timetable schedules (every 30 mins). The Seaford line was not affected as it was electrified. During these critical railcar repairs the Grange line was closed.\n\nIn the 2008/09 State Budget it was announced that five out of six of Adelaide's railway lines were to be electrified commencing with the Noarlunga and Gawler lines. This was to have resulted in 58 of the 3000/3100 class railcars being converted to electric operation with the remaining 12 to be retained as diesels for operation on the Belair line. However with the electrification project scaled back, the conversions were cancelled.\n\nCommencing in April 2018, all 3000/3100 series railcars began a life extension program which included new Mercedes-Benz engines, upgraded bogies, enhanced upholstery and a repaint into the a red and blue livery similar to the 4000 class units. The modernised livery features silver borders around the headlights and tail lights to allow for better illumination throughout light hours.\n\nThe Class 3000/3100 currently use yellow LED sign banners to indicate to passengers the next stop and/or service announcements. \nIn early 2018, the class 3000/3100 received a station/service announcement voice upgrade, switching from a voice dubbed \"Ethel\" which was used on the trams in Adelaide to a voice now dubbed \"Tony\".\nThe boarding/alighting door announcements also received an update, using the same \"Tony\" voice sound clips.\n\n"}
{"id": "1977472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977472", "title": "Dafydd Gam", "text": "Dafydd Gam\n\nDafydd ap Llewelyn ap Hywel (c. 1380 – 25 October 1415), better known as Dafydd Gam, anglicized to David or Davy Gam, was a Welsh warrior, a prominent opponent of Owain Glyndŵr. \nHe died at the Battle of Agincourt fighting for King Henry V, King of England in that victory against the French. \n\nThe name \"Gam\" is taken from a Welsh word for \"lame/deformed\" (from which \"gammy\", as in \"gammy leg\", is derived). Regarded as a traitor (\"Crooked David\") by some in Wales, he is regarded as a hero in England; his reputation has waxed and waned with those of his enemy Owain Glyndŵr and his ally King Henry V.\n\nDafydd Gam was a member of one of the most prominent Welsh families in Breconshire (though the county did not exist in Dafydd's time). His recent pedigree was 'Dafydd Gam ap Llywelyn ap Hywel Fychan ap Hywel ap Einion Sais', but beyond that the family claimed an ancient Welsh lineage going back to the Kings of Brycheiniog (specifically, from Bleddyn ap Maenarch, the king who Bernard de Neufmarché supposedly displaced). Dafydd Gam was the grandson of Hywel Fychan, who held the manor of Parc Llettis near Llanover in Monmouthshire near Abergavenny, and was fourth in descent from who held a castle at Pen Pont on the River Usk near Brecon and who had served at both the Battle of Crecy and the Battle of Poitiers. Their power base had developed mainly as consistently loyal supporters of the de Bohun family who were both earls of Hereford and Marcher Lords of Brecknock from the 13th century onwards. Dafydd Gam's father, Llywelyn ap Hywel, purchased the estate of Penywaun near Brecon and Dafydd is thought to have been born there. His family was described as \"a striking example of a native family that flourished under the rule of an English aristocratic family.\" Under Llywelyn ap Hywel, the family's traditional loyalty was transferred to the new Lord of Brecknock, Henry Bolingbroke, who had married Mary de Bohun in the 1380s. Some say Dafydd was previously in service to Henry's father John of Gaunt and, having killed a rival in Brecon High Street, had to leave Wales temporarily.\n\nDafydd Gam was certainly being paid the substantial annuity of 40 marks by Henry's estate in 1399, even before Bolingbroke became King, and later he and his brothers were described as King's esquires. It seems likely they were prominent partisans of Henry in South East Wales as he gathered support for his overthrow of Richard II around 1399.\n\nWhen the Owain Glyndŵr rebellion broke out in 1400, the family's traditional loyalty to their liege lord remained unshaken and they played a leading role in opposition to the rebellion in the area. Their lands in and around Brecon became a target for Glyndŵr's attacks, and were extensively damaged as early as 1402–1403. The Scottish chronicler Walter Bower names Dafydd as a leader in the crushing defeat of Glyndŵr's men at the Battle of Pwll Melyn near Usk on 5 May 1405. After the battle, 300 of Glyndŵr's men were executed and his son, Gruffudd ab Owain Glyndŵr, was captured. Gam's local knowledge might well have played a part in the Crown's victory here and in other battles like that at Grosmont around the same time, and may have won over local Welshmen to fight against Glyndŵr. The family's loyalty was rewarded with the gift of some of Glyndŵrs' supporters' confiscated estates in Cardiganshire. In 1412 Dafydd Gam was captured by Glyndŵr's men and estimates of the amount paid as his ransom recorded at the time, range from 200 to 700 marks, a large amount. That it was paid directly and speedily from the King's estates in Wales indicates the esteem in which Gam was held by Henry. Glyndŵr had made Gam swear an oath to never bear arms against him again or oppose him in any other way. On his release Gam told King Henry of Glyndŵr's whereabouts and attacked Glyndwr's men. Glyndŵr had Gam's Brecon estates attacked and burned in retaliation and his Brecon house was razed.\n\nGiven King Henry V's leadership in the campaign against Glyndŵr, Dafydd would have known the new King crowned in 1413 personally, and perhaps even fought alongside him. Records show that Dafydd Gam served with three-foot archers in the Battle of Agincourt campaign. His death in the battle was a fact noted in several contemporary chronicles. There is much controversy about whether Gam was knighted at the battle. His example shows that Welshmen continued to fight in the English army after the Glyndŵr rebellion.\n\nStories of Gam's exploits at Battle of Agincourt in which he saved Henry V's life, and that he was knighted either posthumously or as he was dying on the field of victory at Agincourt by King Henry V as a result, are not vouched for in contemporary sources and have thus been discounted by many historians. According to the legend the intervention occurred during the counter-charge of John I, Duke of Alençon, which certainly is historical, leading to the wounding of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, and Henry fighting hand-to-hand in the late stage of the battle. The King was hard pressed and the Duke of Alençon supposedly cut an ornament from Henry's crown with a sword blow. Then a group of Welsh knights in the King's bodyguard led by Dafydd Gam intervened to save Henry's life, only for some to be killed in doing so, including Dafydd himself, and his son in law Sir Roger Vaughan. One of those supposedly involved in this exploit was Sir William ap Thomas who survived the battle. Some accounts claim Dafydd slew the Duke of Alençon himself. This story was being frequently told by the Tudor period in histories of the campaign and by the descendants of those involved and was widely accepted as the truth at that time. Although both Gam and Vaughan did die in the battle, the exact circumstances of their deaths are unknown. Gam's reputation was still very much alive in 19th-century Wales. George Borrow said of him, \"where he achieved that glory which will for ever bloom, dying, covered with wounds, on the field of Agincourt after saving the life of the king, to whom in the dreadest and most critical moment of the fight he stuck closer than a brother\". Juliet Barker, while not accepting the rest of the legend, claims in her history of Agincourt that \"Llewelyn was knighted on the field, only to fall in the battle.\" She also says that Dafydd's Welsh comrade, and posthumous son-in-law, Sir William ap Thomas may have been knighted at the battle.\n\nSome of Dafydd's descendants, who adopted the surname 'Games' to mark their connection to him, remained one of the most powerful families in the Breconshire area until Stuart times. They were noted for their support for Welsh bards. His beautiful daughter Gwladys ferch Dafydd Gam, \"Seren y Fenni\" (\"the Star of Abergavenny\"), made two good marriages, the first to Sir Roger Vaughan, who also died at Agincourt. Her second was to Sir William ap Thomas of Raglan Castle who survived the battle. Her son became the extremely powerful William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423-1469) and took the surname Herbert, later to become one of the best known names in the nobility. All these noble connections ensured Dafydd Gam's name remained a celebrated one.\n\nLike his opponent Glyndŵr, Gam has gained a sheen of legend and many stories about him are late oral traditions, folklore and family legends of uncertain reliability. Chief amongst them is the tale that he tried to assassinate Glyndŵr at his parliament at Machynlleth in 1404. According to local lore, when the attempt failed, he was imprisoned in the Royal House, which survives. The legends differ on his subsequent fate. Some claim that Glyndŵr released Gam soon after the Parliament, despite his refusal to submit, a decision that Glyndŵr would later regret. Others say that he was imprisoned for many years – but these are contradicted by his apparent participation in the Battle of Pwll Melyn in 1405. The stories concerning his rivalry with Glyndŵr include satirical englyn in Welsh, supposedly composed by Glyndŵr himself about his rival after he had burnt his house to the ground. Whatever the truth of these tales there seems no doubt that Glyndŵr and his men, and popular tradition, regarded Dafydd as one of the chief enemies of the rebellion.\n\nGeorge Borrow describes Gam in \"Wild Wales\" (1862) as follows: \"He was small of stature and deformed in person, though possessed of great strength. He was very sensitive of injury, though quite as alive to kindness; a thorough-going enemy and a thorough-going friend.\" \n\nGam is a key character in John Cowper Powys's novel \"Owen Glendower\" (1941).\n\nBy the Tudor period, Gam appears to have typified the loyal and valiant Welshman. He is better known in England as \"Davy Gam\", under which name he is mentioned briefly in Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" (4.8.102) as the last name in the short list of the noble fallen read out to King Henry. His influence on the play may have been greater still: in the words of the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", Dafydd \"may indeed, as has been suggested, be the model for Shakespeare's Fluellen, the archetypal Welshman\". The theory dates back to at least 1812, when it was said: \"There can be little doubt but that Shakspeare, in his burlesque character of Fluellen, intended David Gam.\"\n\n\"Fluellen\": \"If your Majesty is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which your Majesty knows, to this hour is an honourable badge of the service, and I do believe, your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day.\"<br>\n\n\"King Henry\": \"I wear it for a memorable honour; for I am Welsh, you know, good my countryman.\"\n\nAccording to local legend, one of Gam's homes was a moated manor house at Hen Gwrt (of which only the moat survives), close to the village of Llantilio Crossenny, near Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. He is commemorated in a stained glass window, of unknown date, in the north wall of Llantilio Crossenny church. The Latin inscription reads in translation: \"David Gam, golden haired knight, Lord of the manor of Llantilio Crossenny, killed on the field of Agincourt 1415\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1977492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977492", "title": "The New Negro", "text": "The New Negro\n\nThe New Negro: An Interpretation (1925) is an anthology of fiction, poetry, and essays on African and African-American art and literature edited by Alain Locke, who lived in Washington, DC, and taught at Howard University during the Harlem Renaissance. As a collection of the creative efforts coming out of the burgeoning New Negro Movement or Harlem Renaissance, the book is considered by literary scholars and critics to be the definitive text of the movement. \"The Negro Renaissance\" included Locke's title essay \"The New Negro,\" as well as nonfiction essays, poetry, and fiction by writers including Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and Eric Walrond.\n\n\"The New Negro: An Interpretation\" dives into how the African Americans sought social, political, and artistic change. Instead of accepting their position in society, Locke saw the new negro as championing and demanding civil rights. In addition, his anthology sought to change old stereotypes and replaced them with new visions of black identity that resisted simplification. The essays and poems in the anthology mirror real life events and experiences.\n\nThe anthology reflects the voice of middle class African American citizens that wanted to have equal civil rights like the white, middle class counterparts. However, some writers, such as Langston Hughes, sought to give voice to the lower, working class.\n\nPart 1 contains Alain Locke's title essay \"the New Negro\" as well as the fiction and poetry sections. One of the poems, “White Houses” within the anthology represents, the African Americans struggle to confront and challenge the White House and white America, in order to fight for their civil rights. It shows a figure being shut out and left on the street to fend for himself. This is a figure who is not allowed the glory of the inside world, which represents the American ideals of freedom and opportunity.\n\n\"The New Negro in a New World\" includes social and political analysis by writers including W. E. B. Du Bois, historian E. Franklin Frazier, Melville J. Herskovits, James Weldon Johnson, Paul U. Kellogg, Elise Johnson McDougald, Kelly Miller, Robert R. Moton, and activist Walter Francis White.\n\nThe book contains several portraits by Winold Reiss and illustrations by Aaron Douglas. It was published by Albert and Charles Boni, New York, in 1925.\n\nAlain Locke commonly draws on the theme of the \"Old\" vs. the \"New Negro\". The Old Negro according to Locke was a “creature of moral debate and historical controversy”. The Old Negro was restricted by the inhumane conditions of slavery that he was forced to live in; historically traumatized due to events forced upon them and the social perspective of them as a whole. The Old Negro was something to be pushed and moved around and told what to do and worried about. The Old Negro was a product of stereotypes and judgments that were put on them, not ones that they created. They were forced to live in a shadow of themselves and others' actions.\n\nThe New Negro according to Locke is a Negro that now has an understanding of oneself. They no longer lack self respect and self dependence, which has created a new dynamic and allowed the birth of the New Negro. The Negro spirituals revealed themselves; suppressed for generations under the stereotypes of Wesleyan hymn harmony, secretive, half-ashamed, until the courage of being natural brought them out—and behold, there was folk music. They have become the Negro of today which is also the changed Negro. Locke speaks about the migration having an effect on the Negro, leveling the playing field and increasing the realm of how the Negro is viewed because they were moved out of the south and into other areas where they could start over. The migration in a sense transformed the Negro and fused them together as they all came from all over the world, all walks of life, and all different backgrounds.\n\nOne of the themes in Locke's anthology is self-expression. Locke states, \"It was rather the necessity for fuller, truer self-expression, the realization of the unwisdom of allowing social discrimination to segregate him mentally, and a counter-attitude to cramp and fetter his own living—and so the 'spite-wall'... has happily been taken down.\" He explains how it is important to realize that social discrimination can mentally affect you and bring you down. In order to break through that social discrimination, self-expression is needed to show who you truly are, and what you believe in. For Locke, this idea of self-expression is embedded in the poetry, art, and education of the Negro community. Locke includes essays and poems in his anthology that emphasize the theme of self-expression. For example, the poem “Tableau,” by Countée Cullen, is about a white boy and a black boy who walk with locked arms while others judge them. It represents that despite the history of racial discrimination from the whites to the blacks, they show what they believe is right in their self-expression, no matter how other people judge them. Their self-expression allows them not to let the judgement make them conform to societal norms with the separation of blacks and whites. Cullen's poem, “Heritage,” also shows how one finds self-expression in facing the weight of their own history as African Americans brought from Africa to America as slaves. Langston Hughes’ poem, “Youth,” puts forth the message that Negro youth have a bright future, and that they should rise together in their self-expression and seek freedom.\n\nThe publication of Locke's anthology coincides with the rise of the Jazz Age, the Roaring Twenties, and the Lost Generation. Locke's anthology acknowledges how the Jazz age heavily impacts the individually and collectively within the African-American community as well as on America's robust cultural industries, music, film, theater—all of which fully benefited from the creativity and newly discovered contributions of African Americans. Locke in the anthology \"The New Negro\" explains how African American used music such as Jazz and Blues to escape poverty. It was Alain Locke who said that the Jazz age was, “a spiritual coming of age” for African American artists and thinkers, who seized upon their “first chances for group expression and self-determination.” Harlem Renaissance poets and artists such as Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, and Georgia Douglas Johnson explored the beauty and pain of black life through jazz and blues and sought to define themselves and their community outside of white stereotypes.\n\nSome of the most prominent African American artist that were greatly influenced by the “New Negro” concept that reflected in their music and concert works were William Grant Still and Duke Ellington. Duke Ellington, a renowned jazz artist, began to reflect the \"New Negro\" in his music, particularly in the jazz suite \"Black, Brown, and Beige\". The Harlem Renaissance prompted a renewed interest in black culture that was even reflected in the work of white artists, the most well known example being George Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\".\n\nAlain Locke's, \"The New Negro\", includes different forms of literature. Many center around the idea of a “rebirth and renewal” of black Americans that would help in their efforts to overcome oppression. In his essay, Locke gives the reader an image to illustrate the idea. He writes, “By shedding the old chrysalis of the Negro problem we are achieving something like a spiritual emancipation”. He continues to explain by encouraging a change in the oppressed mindset that promotes transforming our problems into constructivism. In this act, the oppressed undergoes a sort of metamorphosis, abandoning the psychological and social limitations of the past to strive for social and economic freedom. This sense of metamorphosis is apparent in a poem included in the anthology called “Baptism” by Claude McKay. It can be read as a narrative of a spiritual renewal in which someone enters a furnace naked, weak, and afraid but returns strong and dignified. This spirit of renewed dignity and strength is captured in many of the writings included in \"The New Negro\".\n\nThe release of \"The New Negro\" and the writing and philosophy laid out by Alain Locke were met with wide support. However, not everyone agreed with the New Negro movement and its ideas. Some criticized the author selections, specifically Eric W. Reader, who wrote the collection of short stories “Tropic Death\" (1926). He found Locke's selected “contemporary black leaders inadequate or ineffective in dealing with the cultural and political aspirations of black masses\". Others, like the African American academic Harold Cruse, even found the term New Negro “politically naive or overly optimistic”. Even some modern late 20th century authors like Gilbert Osofsky were concerned that the ideas of the New Negro would go on to stereotype and glamorize black life. Still, Locke would go on to continue defending the idea of the New Negro.\n\nAfter Locke published \"The New Negro\", the anthology seemed to have served its purpose in trying to demonstrate that African Americans were advancing intellectually, culturally, and socially. This was important at a time like the early 19th century where African Americans were still being looked down upon by most whites. They did not get the same respect as whites did, and that was changing. The publication of \"The New Negro\" was able to help many of the authors featured in the anthology get their names and work more widely known. The publication became a rallying cry to other African Americans to try and join the up-and-coming New Negro movement at the time. \"The New Negro\" was also instrumental in making strides toward dispelling negative stereotypes associated with African Americans.\n\nLocke’s legacy sparks a reoccurring interest in examining African culture and art. Not only was Locke's philosophy important during the Harlem Renaissance period, but continuing today, researchers and academia continue to analyze Locke's work. Locke’s anthology \"The New Negro: An Interpretation\" has endured years of reprinting spanning from 1925 until 2015. Locke’s anthology has been reprinted in book form nearly thirty-five times since its original publication in 1925.  Locke’s original anthology was published in 1925 by New York publisher Albert and Charles Boni.  The most recent reprint was published by Mansfield Center CT: Martino Publishing, 2015.\n\nBeyond Locke’s work being reprinted, Locke’s influences extend to other authors and academics interested in Locke’s views and philosophy of African culture and art.  Author Anna Pochmara wrote \"The Making of the New Negro.\" Journal articles by Leonard Harris, \"Alain Locke and Community\" and \"Identity: Alain Locke’s Atavism\".  Essays by John C. Charles \"What was Africa to him? : Alain Locke\" in the book \"New Voices on the Harlem Renaissance.\"  \n\nLocke’s influence on the Harlem Renaissance encouraged artists and writers like Zora Neale Hurston to seek inspiration from Africa.  Artists Aaron Douglas, William H. Johnson, Archibald Motley, and Horace Pippin created artwork representing the “New Negro Movement” influenced by Locke’s anthology.\n\n"}

She was named for the borough of Wyalusing in Bradford County, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Wyalusing\" was built at Philadelphia by C. H. & W. H. Cramp, launched on 12 May 1863, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 8 February 1864, with Lieutenant Commander Walter W. Queen in command.\n\nAssigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, \"Wyalusing\" joined the contingent of that force stationed in Albemarle Sound, North Carolina on 29 April. Just 10 days before her arrival, the Confederate ironclad ram CSS \"Albemarle\" had made her long-awaited appearance in battle, ramming two of the blockading Union gunboats in the process. As a result of her support, Confederate land forces recaptured Plymouth, North Carolina on 20 April. \"Wyalusing\" had her first scrape with the formidable Confederate warship on 5 May. \"Albemarle\" steamed out of her haven on the Roanoke River that afternoon accompanied by steamers CSS \"Bombshell\" and CSS \"Cotton Plant\" to try to wreak more havoc on the blockaders. The Union picket boats stationed at the mouth of the Roanoke retired to raise the alarm. Gunboats , , and \"Wyalusing\" immediately formed a line of battle supported by , and .\n\nWhen the Southern ram appeared, \"Mattabesset\", \"Whitehead\" and \"Wyalusing\" opened fire almost simultaneously. \"Wyalusing\" passed \"Albemarle\" at about 150 yards distance, rounded her, and headed to attack \"Bombshell\". The latter Confederate, however, had already surrendered, so \"Wyalusing\" backed clear of her and renewed the attack on the more formidable foe, \"Albemarle\". A heavy, but inconclusive, gun action ensued. Impending darkness brought the fighting to a close, and \"Albemarle\" headed back up the Roanoke.\n\n\"Wyalusing\" and her consorts resumed blockade station in the sound, but all efforts were made over the next five months to destroy the Confederate ironclad. The first of those missions was concocted and attempted by five \"Wyalusing\" sailors on 26 May. They rowed up Middle River that afternoon carrying two 100-pound torpedoes, and then carried them by stretcher across the swampland separating the Middle and Roanoke Rivers to a point just above and opposite \"Albemarle\"'s mooring place at Plymouth. Two of the sailors then swam across the river with a towline attached to the explosive devices and then hauled them across. The torpedoes were then joined together by a bridle, and one of the sailors guided them down toward the ram hoping to place the bridle across her prow with a torpedo making contact with either side of her hull. He was then to swim clear before another man stationed across the river detonated the torpedoes electrically. The Confederates caught sight of both swimmer and torpedoes when they were just a few yards short of their goal. A hail of musketry from the shore followed soon after a sentry's hail. The swimmer quickly cut the guide line, retired, and then swam back across the river. The five Union sailors scattered. Three returned to \"Wyalusing\" on the evening of 28 May. The remaining two rejoined their ship the following night after rescue by \"Commodore Hull\". The five men, Coxswain John W. Lloyd, Coal Heavers Charles H. Baldwin and Benjamin Lloyd, and Firemen Alexander Crawford and John Laverty, ultimately received the Medal of Honor for their attempt.\n\nDuring the ensuing months, while \"Wyalusing\" remained on station in the sound, more unsuccessful plans to destroy the Confederate ram were developed. It was not until the night of 27 October—28 that Lieutenant William B. Cushing accomplished \"Albemarle\"'s destruction in a steam launch outfitted with a spar torpedo. That event opened the way for the recapture of Plymouth and for further offensive action on the Roanoke and Middle Rivers.\n\nOn 29 October, \"Wyalusing\", in company with other gunboats, steamed up the Roanoke toward Plymouth; but, just below the objective, impassable barriers barred the way. Undaunted, the warships crossed over to Middle River, journeyed to another crossover point above Plymouth, and then steamed downriver toward the goal. The next day, the gunboats exchanged shot and shell with Confederate shore batteries and rifle pits protecting Plymouth. The Confederates fought stubbornly, but the heavy-caliber Union cannonade eventually prevailed and forced the Southerners to abandon their fortifications. A landing party from \"Wyalusing\" took possession of Fort Williams, captured prisoners, and helped to retake Plymouth.\n\nOn 9 December, an expedition, of which \"Wyalusing\" was a part, moved farther up the Roanoke to capture Rainbow Bluff and another Confederate ram, rumored to be under construction at Halifax, North Carolina. While anchoring near Jamesville, North Carolina, , another gunboat, struck two torpedoes (mines) and sank up to her gun deck. , a tug, moved alongside \"Otsego\" to offer assistance, but she, too, struck a torpedo and sank immediately. \"Wyalusing\" and the remainder of the expedition left the two partially sunken ships under the protection of their own unsubmerged guns and headed upriver, cautiously dragging for torpedoes as they went. By the time they had reached the point of attack, the Confederate positions at Rainbow Bluff had been so well reinforced and the approaches so heavily strewn with torpedoes that the Union ships had to abandon the enterprise. \"Wyalusing\" and her consorts returned to Plymouth on 28 December 1864 and resumed blockade and amphibious support duties.\n\nOn 9 January 1865, she captured the schooner \"Triumph\", laden with salt, at the mouth of the Perquimans River. She also helped to clear the various rivers and streams along the sound of obstructions and torpedoes and managed to capture a Confederate schooner in the process. She continued duty in the Albemarle Sound and Cape Hatteras areas until a month after General Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, Virginia on 9 April. She arrived in New York on 21 May and was decommissioned there on 10 June 1865. Later transferred to Philadelphia, she was sold there on 15 October 1867.\n\nAs of 2005, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named \"Wyalusing\".\n\n"}

Much of its length is close to the border with Maine. The section from Portsmouth to Milton is a controlled-access toll highway known as the Spaulding Turnpike. Between Milton and Chocorua, and between Conway and Glen, it is known as the White Mountain Highway. It is known as Chocorua Mountain Highway between Chocorua and Conway and various other local names before crossing into Maine about south of the Canadian border. Portions of NH 16 run concurrent with U.S. Route 4 (US 4), US 202, NH 25, and US 302, and US 2.\n\nThe southern terminus of NH 16 is at the Portsmouth Traffic Circle, intersecting with Interstate 95 and the US 1 Bypass. The northern terminus is at the Maine state line near Wentworth's Location, where it continues as Maine State Route 16.\n\nThere are three auxiliary routes of NH 16, two loops labeled 16A and one labeled 16B.\n\n\"For the section of NH 16 between Portsmouth and Milton, see the Spaulding Turnpike article.\"\n\nFrom Milton, NH 16 continues north, roughly paralleling the Maine border. In Wakefield, the road takes a turn to the northwest heading towards Ossipee. NH 16 turns back to a northerly heading near Tamworth, then makes a turn eastward in Albany to reach Conway. NH 16 turns north again in Conway, entering the region known as the Mount Washington Valley, and begins a concurrency with US 302 at the south end of the village of North Conway. North of North Conway, in Bartlett, the southern NH 16A loop departs and rejoins NH 16 / US 302 before the road makes a westward hook.\n\nIn Glen, NH 16 turns north from US 302 and heads toward Jackson, where the northern NH 16A loop is located, as well as NH 16B, which is a loop that begins and ends at NH 16A. Continuing north, NH 16 passes through Pinkham Notch, to the east of Mount Washington, New Hampshire's highest peak, and intersecting with the base of the Mount Washington Auto Road. Route 16 meets US 2 in Gorham, sharing a short concurrency along Gorham's Main Street. Leaving US 2, Route 16 continues north along the Androscoggin River to the city of Berlin, then follows the river north through the towns of Milan and Dummer, and the township of Cambridge, into the town of Errol. From Errol NH 16 continues northeast to Wentworth's Location and the Maine border. After crossing the border the road becomes Maine State Route 16 and heads east toward Rangeley.\n\n From 1922 until 1926, most of the original surface alignment of NH 16 from Portsmouth to the intersection with NH 26 in Errol was known as New England Interstate Route 16, the \"East Side Road\". In 1926, the New England road marking system was superseded by the system of United States Numbered Highways, and many of the New England Routes, including NH 16, became state highways with the same number.\n\nNH 16 formerly served as a non-tolled alternative to the Spaulding Turnpike between Dover and Rochester. In the early 1990s, NHDOT rerouted NH 16 onto the turnpike as a concurrency for the full length of the turnpike. The old alignment is now made up of several different roads. After crossing the Little Bay Bridge (or, prior to 1966, the General Sullivan Bridge) northbound from Newington to Dover, historic NH 16 traveled along Dover Point Road into downtown Dover to an intersection with NH 108, where that route used to terminate. NH 16 continued along Central Avenue north through Somersworth and into Rochester on what is now the northern stretch of NH 108. In Rochester, NH 16 used the present alignment of NH 125 through downtown and north into Milton where it met the current alignment north of the Turnpike.\n\nAfter NH 16 was rerouted, the section between downtown Dover and NH 125 in Rochester became a northward extension of NH 108. From downtown Rochester the alignment to Milton is now part of NH 125. Between the Rochester/Milton town line and the northern terminus of the Spaulding Turnpike, NH 125 carries the White Mountain Highway moniker.\n\nThe Conway Bypass is a proposed re-routing of NH 16 around Conway and North Conway. While preliminary work has been done, the bypass is still in planning stages.\n\nNew Hampshire Route 16A is a designation held by two separate state highways in New Hampshire. Although not directly connected, the two routes are linked by their parent route, New Hampshire Route 16.\n\nThe southern segment of NH 16A is a loop road, known locally as the Intervale Resort Loop, entirely in the town of Bartlett. It splits off from U.S. Route 302 and NH 16, runs parallel to the highway for , then rejoins US 302 and NH 16.\n\nOfficially, this section of NH 16A is also designated U.S. Route 302 Business, but is not signed as such anywhere along the route. This is a rare instance of a hidden route in New Hampshire and is interesting in that a duplicate state numbering has been given precedence over a unique federal one.\n\nThe northern segment of NH 16A is a loop road in Jackson that is long. This road leaves NH 16, travels east to meet both the southern and northern termini of NH 16B (separated by just ) and returns to NH 16, passing through the Wentworth Golf Club. The local name for this route is Village Road.\n\nNew Hampshire Route 16B is a long state highway located entirely in Jackson. Although the road is signed north–south, NH 16B is a nearly-complete loop, beginning and ending at intersections with NH 16A roughly apart. Heading counterclockwise on NH 16B (signed \"north\") from NH 16A, NH 16B is known as Black Mountain Road, Moody Farm Road, and Carter Notch Road. The entire route has also been known as Five Mile Circuit Road, in reference to its length.\n\nIn addition to its present designation, NH 16B has been assigned to several old alignments of NH 16, but those other routes are no longer officially designated as such.\n\nIn Ossipee, NH 16B was once the designation for an old alignment of NH 16 through the village of Center Ossipee that has been bypassed by the present NH 16 southwest of Ossipee Lake. The route, in length, is still called \"Route 16B\" on street blade signs.\n\nTwo other roads have also held the NH 16B designation. One is a local road called Old Rochester Road in Somersworth and Old Dover Road in Rochester, paralleling the Spaulding Turnpike in those two towns from NH 108 to NH 125. There is no longer any signage along the road indicating that the road was designated NH 16B.\n\nThe other road followed what is now NH 125 between NH 16 near Union and NH 153 in Union, as well as NH 153 from NH 125 north to NH 16 in Wakefield. The section of NH 125 in Carroll County is still shown as NH 16B on several maps.\n"}

While typically practiced on sea cliffs at high tide, it can also be done on climbs above reservoirs, rivers, and even swimming pools.\n\nOften a dinghy or other small boat is kept on scene to pick up the fallen climber, as a fall from a taller route can still pose the risk of being knocked unconscious on contact with the water, which could lead to drowning. \n\nThe practice of deep-water soloing in Majorca has its roots in the late 1970s. In 1978, Miquel Riera became frustrated with the aid climbing routes in his local area, so he went to Porto Pi, Palma with his friends Jaume Payeras, Eduardo Moreno and Pau Bover in order to find routes that they could free climb. This became Majorca's first bouldering venue, and as time went Riera progressed onto the short sea cliffs near there. It was named \"Psicobloc\", which, when translated literally into English, means \"Psycho Bouldering\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, psicobloc was overshadowed by sport climbing, which was growing greatly in popularity, but this did not stop Riera from continuing his obsession, as he put up many new routes and published articles in the Spanish climbing press.\n\nDWS became more mainstream amongst climbers when a couple of short films were made by popular climbing filmmakers BigUp Productions in 2003. The films featured some of the sport's pioneers: Tim Emmett, Klem Loskot, and a newcomer to the style, Chris Sharma.\n\nThis type of climbing is most notably practiced on the coasts of Dorset, Devon and Majorca, but also in the Calanques near Marseille, around the Southern Pembrokeshire coast, parts of Ireland, Sardinia, Spain, Greece, the lakes of Central Texas, and many other areas.\n\nTyulenovo and Kamen Bryag are places for deep water soloing in Bulgaria that recently gained popularity among the local climbing society and surrounding countries in Eastern Europe. They provide enough material to keep even the real professionals interested for a week. The routes range from 5 to 20 meters and from 5a to 8a. There is also a boulder section.\n\nGibraltar has excellent deep water soloing on Jurassic limestone. The routes are generally steep and interspersed with good traverse sections and large caves. The routes range from 3 meters to 20 meters. \nAll the routes can be easily accessed via the cliff top.\n"}

The US equivalent is the public service announcement (PSA). Public information films were common place in the 1950s till the 2000s however became obsolete with the closure of the COI (Central Office Of Information) \n\nPublic information films returned in 2020 with the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom. They feature information about the virus presented by the Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty. They are being aired on TV channels in the UK.\n\nThe films advise the public on what to do in a multitude of situations ranging from crossing the road to surviving a nuclear attack. They are sometimes thought to concern only topics related to safety, but there are PIFs on many other subjects, including animal cruelty, protecting the environment, crime prevention and how to vote in an election or fill in a census form.\n\nMany of these films were aimed at children and were shown during breaks in children's programmes during holidays and at weekends. Many of them involved or were narrated by celebrities of the day.\n\nThe earliest PIFs were made during the Second World War years and shown in cinemas; many were made by and starred Richard Massingham, an amateur actor who set up Public Relationship Films Ltd when he discovered there was no specialist film company in the area. They were commissioned by the Ministry of Information, and Massingham's work has since gained a cult following for their quirky, often humorous tone. After the war, PIFs were produced by the Central Office of Information (now closed), and again by private contractors, which were usually small film companies.\n\nPIFs were supplied to broadcasters free of charge for them to use whenever they wished. Their usefulness as a cost-free means to fill the gaps in fixed-duration commercial breaks left by unsold advertising airtime led to their being used regularly and extensively in the 1960s, 1970s and much of the 1980s, and consequently, within both the COI and broadcasting companies, they were typically known as \"fillers\". They are still being produced, although the vastly reduced need for broadcasters to turn to third-party filler material to deal with unused airtime during breaks or junctions means they are now only seen rarely, usually in night time spots. Fillers are still produced and distributed by the Cabinet Office by the Filler Marketing team.\n\nThe COI closed on 30 December 2011 after 65 years, and no longer makes PIFs. However, there are a few companies still distributing PIFs, such as THINK!, Fire Kills, DOE, National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), and National Rail.\nSome advertisements and charity appeals have gained the status of honorary PIF among fans, including \"Cartoon Boy\", a 2002 campaign about child abuse produced by the NSPCC while films such as the 1980s British Gas advertisement about what to do in the event of a gas leak can be considered non-Governmental PIFs.\n\nPIFs have a nostalgic cult following and a DVD was released in 2001 called \"Charley Says: The Greatest Public Information Films in the World\", comprising the contents of two earlier VHS releases. A sequel was released in 2005.\n\nPublic information films produced by the COI covered a wide range of subjects. The fillers listed above were for domestic consumption. However, COI films was also commissioned by the British Foreign Office to supply films for overseas use. These films dealt with research and development, British products and the British way of life. They were usually distributed through the diplomatic network but not always. Some films were sold commercially to overseas outlets, mostly television.\n\n\nA number of musical artists have been heavily influenced by the analogue, overdriven sound of British PIFs, including Boards of Canada and most artists on the Ghost Box Records label, especially The Advisory Circle, whose album Other Channels directly references or samples many PIFs, including \"Keep Warm, Keep Well\". Additionally, their debut album features a few reprises with the suffix \"PIF\". Another example of PIF influence in music was that of the song \"Charly\" by The Prodigy, from 1991, which heavily sampled the meows of Charley Cat. The song \"Two Tribes\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood made use of the sirens from the \"Protect and Survive\" films.\n\nThe comedian Chris Morris satirised public information films in \"The Day Today\" in an episode where there was a constitutional crisis. The Scarfolk website and book feature parodic posters in the British public information style.\n\n"}

Because there was no printing press in Uganda, the stamps were made on a typewriter by the Rev. E. Millar of the Church Missionary Society, in March 1895, at the request of C. Wilson, an official of the Imperial British East Africa Company. After Millar received a much-needed new ribbon, the color of the typewritten characters changed from black to a violet color. The stamps were valid for postage within the Kingdom of Buganda; in adjoining kingdoms and provinces they were used only for communications between officials of the Church Missionary Society.\n\nThe values of the stamps varied, but all were denominated in cowries (monetary seashells), at 200 cowries per rupee or 12½ cowries = 1d. The design was simple, showing just the initials of the jurisdiction and a number for the denomination. The paper used was extremely thin. The stamps have been forged Only a small number of the genuine stamps seem to have survived. Pen initialed, surcharged values exist; of these Robson Lowe commented, \"All are rare. We do not recall selling a copy in over 25 years.\"\n\nWilson's embryonic postal system for Uganda commenced operations on March 20, 1895. A single letterbox was set up in Kampala, at Wilson's office, offering twice-daily letter service to Entebbe and Gayaza for postage of 10 cowries. Other destinations had different rates. For addresses beyond Entebbe or Gayaza the mails were collected less frequently. Letters with European addresses were dispatched once a month, and they arrived at their destinations some three months later.\nThis postal service of Uganda may have been preceded by a postal service of the Kingdom of Unyoro (Bunyoro), which applied a handstamp in Arabic script.\n\nMilitary Forces assumed the operation of the mails in June 1896. The Uganda Missionaries were then followed by a typeset issue from a printing press in November 1896, after the British Foreign Office had gained control of the government.

It was founded by Hermann Henrich Meier and Eduard Crüsemann in Bremen on 20 February 1857. It developed into one of the most important German shipping companies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was instrumental in the economic development of Bremen and Bremerhaven. On 1 September 1970, the company merged with Hamburg America Line (HAPAG) to form Hapag-Lloyd AG.\n\nThe German shipping company North German Lloyd (NDL) was founded by the Bremen merchants Hermann Henrich Meier and Eduard Crüsemann on 20 February 1857, after the dissolution of the Ocean Steam Navigation Company, a joint German-American enterprise. The new shipping company had no association with the British maritime classification society Lloyd's Register; in the mid-19th century, \"Lloyd\" was used as a term for a shipping company (an earlier user of the term in the same context was the Trieste-based Österreichischer Lloyd).\n\nH. H. Meier became NDL's first Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and Crüsemann became the first director of the company (German \"Aktiengesellschaft\" – AG). Crüsemann was in charge of both cargo services and passenger transport, which, as a result of emigration, was growing significantly. The company was also active in other areas, including tugboats, bathing, insurance, and ship repair (the last of which it still provides). The first office of the shipping company was located at number 13 Martinistraße in Bremen.\n\nThe company started with a route to England prior to starting a transatlantic service. In 1857, the first ship, the \"Adler\" (Eagle), began regular passenger service between the Weser region (where Bremen is located) and England. On 28 October 1857, it made its maiden voyage from Nordenham to London.\n\nJust one year later, regular, scheduled services were started between the new port in Bremerhaven and New York using two steamships, the \"Bremen\" and the \"New York\". International economic crises made the start of the NDL extremely difficult, and the company took losses until 1859. However, during the succeeding years, passenger connections to Baltimore and New Orleans were added to the schedule, and the company first rented and then in 1869 bought facilities on the waterfront in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1867–1868, NDL began a partnership with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which initiated the Baltimore Line; until 1978, this had its own ships. In 1869, Crüsemann died at only 43 years old. From 1877 to 1892, the Director of NDL was Johann Georg Lohmann. He established a new policy for the company, emphasizing fast liners. Eventually, however, H. H. Meier and Lohmann fell out over the direction of the company. In 1892, a twin-screw steamer, the company's first, was christened the \"H.H. Meier\" after the founder; this helped to heal the breach between them.\n\nDuring the \"Gründerzeit\" at the beginning of the German Empire, the NDL expanded greatly. Thirteen new ships of the \"Strassburg class\" were ordered. A route to the West Indies offered from 1871 to 1874 proved unprofitable, but was followed by a permanent line to the east coast of South America. On the transatlantic route, the HAPAG, the Holland-America Line, and the Red Star Line were now all fierce rivals. Beginning in 1881 with the \"Elbe\", eleven fast steamships of from 4500 to of the so-called \"Rivers class\" (all named for German rivers), were introduced to serve the North Atlantic trade.\n\nIn 1885, the NDL won the commission to provide postal service between the German Empire and Australia and the Far East. The associated subsidy underwrote further expansion, beginning with the first large-scale order placed with a German shipyard, for three postal steamers for the major routes and three smaller steamers for branch service from AG Vulcan Stettin. It was in fact a requirement of the commission that the ships be built in Germany.\n\nBy 1890, with 66 ships of a total , NDL was the second largest shipping company in the world, after the British Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, with 48 ships of a total , and dominated shipping to Germany, with 31.6% of the traffic. NDL was also the carrying more transatlantic passengers to New York than any other company, due to its dominance in steerage, which consisted mostly of immigrants. In cabin class, it carried only slightly more passengers than the British Cunard Line and White Star Line. 42% of NDL's passenger traffic was to New York, and 15% to other US ports, but only 16.2% eastward-bound from New York. Its westbound South Atlantic service represented 17.3% of its passengers; eastbound from South America, only 1.7%.\n\nIn 1887, the NDL withdrew from the route to England in favor of Argo Reederei. However, it continued to provide tug services through participation beginning in 1899 in the \"Schleppschifffahrtsgesellschaft Unterweser\" (Unterweser Tug Association, now Unterweser Reederei).\n\nH. H. Meyer stood down from the board in 1888; he was succeeded by Friedrich Reck. Johann Georg Lohmann became Director of the company; following his death in 1892, Reck stepped down and Georg Plate became chairman. The lawyer Heinrich Wiegand became Director; from 1899 onwards, his title was Director General. He held this position until 1909, and presided over appreciable expansion.\n\nIn 1897, with the commissioning of SS \"Kaiser Wilhelm der Große\", the NDL finally had a major ship for the North Atlantic. This was the largest and fastest ship in the world, and the company benefited from the reputation advantage of the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic crossing, with an average speed of 22.3 knots. Between 1897 and 1907, the line followed with three further four-screw and four-funnel steamers of the Kaiser class, of 14,000–19,000 GT: the , the and the . With these the company offered a regular service across the Atlantic to its docks at Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from New York. On June 30, 1900 over 300 persons were killed in a fire at the Hoboken docks.\n\nSo began the \"decade of Germans\" in transatlantic shipping, in which the NDL and the HAPAG dominated the routes with several record-breaking ships and vied with the British Cunard Line and the White Star Line as the largest shipping companies in the world. In 1902 and 1904, two NDL ships again won the Blue Riband: SS \"Kronprinz Wilhelm\", now with an average speed of for the westbound passage from Cherbourg to New York and \"Kaiser Wilhelm II\" at on the eastbound passage. In 1907, , and then in 1909, , both of the British Cunard Line, won the Blue Riband back for the British, and \"Mauretania\" then retained it until 1929.\n\nBetween 1894 and 1908, NDL ordered many other freight and passenger steamers from several German yards. These included the Barbarossa class (over , for Australia, the Far East, and the North Atlantic) and the Generals class (approximately 8,500 BRT, for the Far East and Australia). \n\nBeginning in 1899, the NDL expanded into the Pacific, acquiring the entire fleets of two small British lines, the Scottish Oriental Steamship Company and the Holt East Indian Ocean Steamship Company, and setting up between 14 and 16 passenger and freight routes in conjunction with the postal service. In 1900, 14 of NDL's passenger ships were requisitioned as troop transports due to the Boxer Rebellion in China; on 27 July, Kaiser Wilhelm II delivered his \"Schrecklichkeit\" speech, in which he compared the military of the German Empire to the Huns, at the departure ceremony for \"Friedrich Der Grosse\". This inspired Britain later, when they seized a number of German ships, to rename them to names beginning with \"Hun\", such as \"Huntsgreen\" and \"Huntsend\". In German, these ships were collectively named \"Hunnendampfer\" (Huns' steamers).\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the U.S. banking magnate J. P. Morgan began to acquire a number of shipping companies, including the White Star Line, the Leyland Line, and the Red Star Line, to build a transatlantic monopoly. He succeeded in signing both HAPAG and NDL to an alliance, but was unable to acquire the British Cunard Line, and the French Compagnie Générale Transatlantique (CGT). HAPAG and NDL gave Morgan the largest U.S. rail company, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and so Morgan offered to divide the market. The Holland-America Line and the Red Star Line together divided a contract for the passengers of the four companies. Ruinous competition was prevented. In 1912, the Morgan Agreement was terminated.\n\nIn 1907, the Norddeutscher Lloyd's fiftieth anniversary, it had 93 vessels, 51 smaller vessels, two sail training vessels and other river steamers. NDL had around 15,000 employees. Because of the high investment costs and an international economic crisis, the shipping company celebrated at this time but also had considerable financial difficulties.\nDespite the financial difficulties, between 1907 and 1910 the company built a new headquarters on Papenburgstrasse in Bremen, the prestigious NDL Building to plans by architect Johann Poppe, who was also the lead interior designer for the company's liners. The building, the largest in the city at the time, was in eclectic Renaissance Revival style with a tower. It was sold in 1942 to Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau and when the company was broken up into its constituent parts after World War II, passed to AG Weser. However, it had been severely damaged by bombing and was ultimately demolished and a Horten department store built on the site in 1969. The adjacent new shopping mall bears the name \"Lloyd Passage\".\n\nThe lucrative North Atlantic route was extremely competitive in this period, with new, attractive ships from other large companies including the , , and , of the Cunard Line, and the , , and of the White Star Line. The HAPAG introduced three new vessels of the Imperator class, , , and , with a size of 50,000 GT. The NDL responded with smaller but prestigious vessels such as the and the , and transferred the SS \"Berlin\" from Mediterranean service to the New York run. Finally in 1914 the company ordered two liners of the Columbus class; however, World War I prevented their completion.\n\nIn this era of \"open borders\" to transatlantic travel, the largest passenger group making the transatlantic crossing were immigrants from Europe to the United States, and NDL carried more than any other steamship line. During 1900–1914, the three NDL vessels carrying the most transatlantic migrants, , and , each brought over 100 thousand steerage passengers to New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia. The economic downturn following the Panic of 1907 led to a sharp fall-off of migrant traffic to America, only partially offset by increased steerage flows back to Europe, and this was the main contributing factor to \"one of the blackest years in the Company's history.\" \n\nIn 1914, NDL employed approximately 22,000 people. Its success thus directly influenced the rapid growth of the city of Bremerhaven, which had been founded only in 1827.\n\nDirector General Dr. Wiegand died in 1909, and was succeeded by Director Phillip Heineken until 1920.\n\nThis is a list of routes served by NDL in 1907.\n\nEurope – America\n\n\nMediterranean\n\n\nEurope – Asia/Australia\n\n\nAsia / Australia (including coastal routes)\n\n\nGerman coast\n\n\nFor NDL as a civilian shipping line, the beginning of World War I was a trial, as well as a logistical challenge because a large part of the fleet was at sea around the World. However, most ships were able to reach neutral ports. The logistical operations of NDL in Bremerhaven were placed almost exclusively at the service of the German Navy. NDL owned a majority interest in the \"Deutsche Ozean-Reederei\" (\"German Ocean Shipping Service\"), which used U-boats for trade and made some successful Atlantic crossings.\n\nAt the start of the war, the NDL's fleet totaled more than . Under the Treaty of Versailles at war's end, all ships over and half of all units from 100 to were confiscated. The United States had already confiscated in 1917 the facilities in Hoboken and the NDL ships at the dock there. The prewar NDL fleet no longer existed. The company was left with some small ships totalling . With these the company restarted daytrip passenger service, tug service, and freight service in 1919. The 'flagship' was the 781-ton \"Grüß Gott\". From 1920 to 1939, NDL participated in the Seedienst Ostpreußen passenger and goods service to East Prussia.\n\nIn 1920, an air transport subsidiary was founded and soon merged with Sablatnig Flugzeugbau GmbH to form Lloyd Luftverkehr Sablatnig. In 1923 this combined with HAPAG's air transport subsidiary to form Deutscher Aero Lloyd, which on 6 January 1926 merged with Junkers Luftverkehr AG to become Deutsche Luft Hansa A.G., the predecessor of Lufthansa.\n\nIn August 1920, the NDL made an agency agreement with the U.S. Mail Steamship Co. (beginning in 1921, United States Lines). This made it possible to resume transatlantic service from Bremerhaven to New York with the former \"Rhein\", now sailing under the US flag as the \"Susquehanna\". The unfinished \"Columbus\" had been awarded to Great Britain after the war and was bought in 1920 by White Star, which had lost significant tonnage in the war and also wished to make up for the pre-war loss of the \"Titanic\". However, work at Danzig proceeded very slowly. Finally in autumn 1921 the so-called Columbus Agreement was reached, under which the German government and NDL undertook to facilitate rapid completion of the \"Columbus\" in exchange for the British government returning ownership to the NDL of six smaller ships which had spent the war years in South America: the postal steamers \"Seydlitz\" and \"Yorck\", the \"Gotha\", and the freighters \"Göttingen\", \"Westfalen\" and \"Holstein\". The company also began to build new freighters and passenger ships and to buy back other ships. In late 1921, service to South America was resumed with the \"Seydlitz\", and in early 1922, East Asian service with the \"Westfalen\". On 12 February 1922, service to New York with NDL's own ships resumed with \"Seydlitz\". The other ship of the Columbus class, the former \"Hindenburg\", was completed in 1924 and named \"Columbus\"; she was placed in scheduled transatlantic passenger service.\nA brief post-war boom was followed by severe inflation in Germany, despite which NDL continued to expand their fleet. Twelve new ships of between 8,700 and were placed in service for South and Central America and the Far East, then in addition to \"Columbus\" three new ships of between 13,000 and for the North Atlantic (the \"München\", \"Stuttgart\" and \"Berlin\"), and in 1927 the former was bought back from Great Britain and placed in service as the \"Dresden\".\n\nIn 1920, Carl Stimming became Director General of NDL, while his predecessor Heineken became Chairman of the Board. Between 1925 and 1928, the company acquired a number of German shipping companies: HABAL, the Roland Line, and Argo. The acquisition of the Roland Line brought Ernst Glässel onto the Board of Directors, where he was to have increasing influence. In 1926, the company were once more able to pay a dividend. American credit financed continuing expansion and orders for new ships.\n\nIn 1929 and 1930, the company placed its two largest ships in service, SS \"Bremen\" () and SS \"Europa\" (). With an average speed of about 27.9 knots, both were to take the Blue Riband for the fastest Atlantic crossings. In 1929, \"Columbus\" was completely refitted.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1939, the volume of passengers travelling between the US and Europe declined sharply. In 1928, the NDL transported about 8% of a passenger volume of 1,168,414 passengers; in 1932, 16.2% of the 751,592 passengers transported; in 1938, around 11% of 685,655 passengers. In addition, there was significant new competition from new Italian, French and British superliners: the Italian SS \"Rex\" () and SS \"Conte di Savoia\" (), the French SS \"Normandie\" (), and the British RMS \"Queen Mary\" ().\nThe 1929 economic crisis which began in the US affected the German shipping companies. The NDL and the HAPAG therefore entered into a cooperation agreement in 1930, and beginning in 1935, instituted joint operations in the North Atlantic. The first signs of a merger were visible. By 1932, the NDL was in an economic crisis, with about 5,000 employees let go, salary cuts, and red ink. Glässel was dismissed. The government placed both NDL and HAPAG in trusteeship under Siegfried Graf von Roedern, and following the death of Stimming, Heinrich F. Albert briefly became head of the NDL, followed after some eighteen months by the National Socialist Rudolph Firle. Bremen State Councillor Karl Lindemann was Chairman of the Board from 1933 to 1945. A programme of economic recovery by divestments and restructuring was initiated. HBAL and the Roland Line became independent companies once more, and other lines took over services to Africa and the Mediterranean. The Nazi regime ordered both NDL and HAPAG to relinquish ships to other lines which were to operate in their regions without competition from other German companies, in particular to Hamburg Süd, the Deutsche Afrika-Linien and the Deutsche Levante Linie.\n\nIn 1935, the \"Scharnhorst\", \"Gneisenau\", and \"Potsdam\", each with about , were placed in service for the Far East. The modernization of the fleet continued and in 1937 the line made modest profits.\n\nOn 28 August 1939 the slipped out of Lyttelton Harbour (New Zealand) on 28 August 1939, on the eve of war, ostensibly for Port Kembla, New South Wales, where she was to have filled her coal bunkers for the homeward passage to Europe. She then headed for the subantarctic Auckland Islands, where she successfully evaded the cruiser , and re-stocked with food and wood. The freighter then made a desperate and successful escape, using jury-rigged sails, to Valparaíso, Chile, in South America. She then made her way into the South Atlantic where, on 24 July 1941, she was intercepted off Montevideo by and scuttled by her crew.\n\nIn 1939 NDL had in service 70 vessels with a total of , including the sail training vessel \"Kommodore Johnsen\" (now the Russian \"STS Sedov\"), 3 daytrip ships, 19 tugs and 125 small ships, and employed 12,255, 8,811 on vessels. Nine further freighters were completed after the outbreak of World War II. This entire fleet was either lost during the war or awarded to the Allies as reparations. \"Columbus\" had to be sunk in 1939; \"Bremen\" burned in 1941; \"Steuben\" was sunk in the Baltic in 1945 with the loss of some 4,000 lives; \"Europa\", claimed by France, became the \"Liberté\" in 1947.\n\nThe Reich was the primary stockholder in the company, but in 1941/42, NDL was once more privatized and cigarette manufacturer Philipp Reemtsma became primary stockholder. Dr. Johannes Kulenkampff, a Board member since 1932, and Richard Bertram, a Board member since 1937, became Chairman in 1942.\n\nAt the end of World War II the company's headquarters (which had in any case been sold in 1942) had been severely damaged by bombing and all its large vessels either destroyed or seized. It was left with only the freighter \"Bogotá\", which was in Japan. Relicensed by the American military administration on November 29, 1945 as a \"coastal shipping and stevedoring company,\" it started again, as after World War I, practically from zero, offering tugboat and daytripper services. Kulenkampff and Bertram constituted the Board and there were at first only 350 employees. In 1948, the first Hapag-Lloyd travel agency opened. Business initially consisted of emigration and a limited amount of tourism. Beginning in 1949, German companies were permitted to order and to build ships of up to . In 1950, the NDL placed its first post-war orders at the Bremer Vulkan shipyard, the Rheinstein class (, 13 knots).\n\nAfter the limitations on German shipping imposed by the Allies were lifted in 1951, the NDL commenced building a new fleet. First it bought older freighters (for example the \"Nabob\", a former American auxiliary aircraft carrier) and had new freighters built between 4,000 and and 5,000 and 13,000 DWT, all with names ending in -\"stein\". The line had routes to Canada, New Orleans, the Canary Islands, and beginning in 1953 to the Far East.\n\nPassenger service resumed in 1955 using a rebuilt 1924 Swedish ship, the MS \"Gripsholm\". Renamed \"Berlin\", she was the sixth German ship of that name, the fourth at NDL, and sailed North Atlantic routes. In 1959, the company added the \"Bremen\" (formerly \"Pasteur\"), and in 1965, the \"Europa\" (formerly \"Kungsholm\"), \"Gripsholm\"'s sister ship bought from the Swedish American Line, with a capacity of 843 passengers. These vessels were first placed in scheduled service to America but soon transferred to cruising. In 1967, the express freighter \"Friesenstein\" (21.5 knots) inaugurated the Friesenstein class and replaced \"Nabob\" and \"Schwabenstein\". Passenger service was running at an increasing deficit, and the rapidly growing container traffic required cost-intensive retooling in the freight business. In 1968 NDL inaugurated container service to the USA with the \"Weser-Express\"; two more container ships were soon added.\n\nAround 1960, NDL had 47 ships, a number that remained almost unchanged until 1970. In 1968, the fleet totaled (in 1970, ) and was the 16th largest shipping company worldwide; HAPAG, with , was the 9th largest. In 1970, NDL had a turnover of 515 million DM and share capital of 54 million DM, and employed 6,200 people, 3,500 of them at sea. \nIn 1967, Claus Wätjen and Dr. Horst Willner, and in 1969 Karl-Heinz Sager, joined the Board. Kulenkampff served on the Board until 1968 and Bertram until 1970. Since the NDL was already executing three quarters of its freight business in association with HAPAG, a merger of the two largest German shipping companies was entirely logical.\n\nOn September 1, 1970, the North German Lloyd merged with Hamburg America Line (HAPAG) to form Hapag-Lloyd AG, based in Hamburg with secondary headquarters in Bremen.\n\nOn 20 February 2007, a small group of dedicated, former member of the North German Lloyd organized for the 150th anniversary of the foundation of the shipping company a meeting at the Bremer Ratskeller. This event was very popular, so it was decided to carry out in the following years further meetings. – Meanwhile, the meetings take place annually on the twentieth of February in Bremen in the former Lloyd's building – today Courtyard Marriott hotel.\n\n\n\nThis is a list of all ships in service of the NDL. Some of the ships were owned previously by other companies.\n\n"}

In 1933, he directed a photographic studio in the 13th Arrondissement of Paris. During World War II, being a Jew, he had to leave occupied Paris. He went to Ambazac, in the Limousin, where he adopted the pseudonym Izis and where he was arrested and tortured by the Nazis. He was freed by the French Resistance and became an underground fighter. At that time he photographed his companions, including Colonel Georges Guingouin. The poet and underground fighter Robert Giraud was the first to write about Izis in the weekly magazine \"Unir\", a magazine created by the Resistance.\n\nUpon the liberation of France at the end of World War II, Izis had a series of portraits of \"maquisards\" (rural resistance fighters who operated mainly in southern France) published to considerable acclaim. He returned to Paris where he became friends with French poet Jacques Prévert and other artists. Izis became a major figure in the mid-century French movement of humanist photography — also exemplified by Brassaï, Cartier-Bresson, Doisneau, Sabine Weiss and Ronis — with \"work that often displayed a wistfully poetic image of the city and its people.\"\n\nFor his first book, \"Paris des rêves\" (Paris of Dreams), Izis asked writers and poets to contribute short texts to accompany his photographs, many of which showed Parisians and others apparently asleep or daydreaming. The book, which Izis designed, was a success. Izis joined \"Paris Match\" in 1950 and remained with it for twenty years, during which time he could choose his assignments.\n\nMeanwhile, his books continued to be popular with the public. Among the numerous books by Izis, Gerry Badger and Martin Parr have especial praise for \"Le Cirque d'Izis\" (The Circus of Izis), \"published in 1965, but bearing the stamp of an earlier era\". Shot mostly in Paris but also in Lyon, Marseille and Toulon, the photographs are \"affectionate and nostalgic, but also deeply melancholic\" with \"a desolate undercurrent\", forming a work that is \"profound, moving and extraordinary\".\n\n\n"}

The river is generally called Bermejo in spite of its different names along its way, but it also has its own Native American names; in Wichí it is called Teuco, and in Guaraní it is called Ypitá. In the plains of Argentina's Gran Chaco the Bermejo forms wetlands and splits into two branches. The southern branch is the bed of the old Bermejo River, now an intermittent stream called Río Bermejito. The northern branch is now the main stem of the Bermejo and is called the Teuco River (\"Río Teuco\"), Bermejo Nuevo, or simply the Bermejo River. The two branches rejoin at , near Villa Río Bermejito, forming the Lower Bermejo River.\n\nThe Bermejo River is long and has a drainage basin of in area. Its mean annual discharge is irregular and varies between and .\n\nThe river is born in a mountain range known as Sierra de Santa Victoria around coordinates near Tarija, a few kilometres southeast of Chaguaya in Bolivia, and not far from La Quiaca, Jujuy Province, Argentina. In general, it maintains a southeastern direction. At its highest part, its main tributaries are the Lipeo River, and further downstream the Grande de Tarija, the Iruya River, and the San Francisco River. It forms part of the international boundary between Argentina and Bolivia.\n\nThe Bermejo is not navigable. In the late 19th century, numerous attempts were made to open up the commercial navigation of the river, but all of them failed, largely due to the river's shallow waters, which carry enormous amounts of sediment. Near the Tropic of Capricorn, the river splits in two; the smaller southern branch, Bermejito, and the northern branch that known as the Teuco River (also called Bermejo or \"Bermejo Nuevo\"). When leaving the province of Salta, the Teuco marks the boundary between the provinces of Chaco and Formosa.\n\nThe Bermejito, is intermittent and meandering. It crosses Chaco Province near the El Impenetrable jungle. On the shores of this river can still be seen the ruins of the former towns of Concepcion del Bermejo, San Bernardo de Vértiz (), and La Cangayé ().\n\nThe Teuco follows its course to finality and into the Paraguay River, in front of the city of Pilar, in Paraguay.\n\nThe river carries red-coloured sediments and produces irregular accumulations that can even alter its course, leaving the older paths as wet depressions.\n\n"}

He was formerly the Principal/CEO of Anglo-Chinese School, and resident warden of its boarding school. He is now currently the Principal of Singapore International School of Bangkok Sixth Form.\n\nOng is an alumnus of Raffles Institution and graduated from the National University of Singapore in 1972 with a Bachelor of Science (with honours) in chemistry. He went on to earn his Doctor of Philosophy in clinical biochemistry at the University of Oxford in 1975 under a Rhodes Scholarship. On his subsequent return to Singapore, he became a physiology lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine of the National University of Singapore (NUS) until 1991. While lecturing in the NUS, he concurrently held the position of Vice-Principal in ACS(I) from 1988 until 1994, when he was appointed Principal.\n\nOng has also published papers in international journals on exercise physiology, sports ergonomics and fitness assessments as well as research papers on education. During his reservist days in the Singapore Armed Forces, he received a Merit Award for his essay \"Discipline and Control in the Military\", submitted for the 1989 Chief of General Staff Annual Essay Competition.\n\nIn addition, Ong was the chairman of the now-defunct Broadcast, Publications & Arts Appeal Advisory Committee (BPAAC), one of the committees that advised the Government of Singapore on censorship issues. He was also an executive committee member of the now-defunct Singapore Centre for Teaching Thinking, established in 1998 at the National Institute of Education, as part of the \"Thinking Schools Learning Nation\" initiative launched by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong in 1997. Ong is recognised as a Solemniser of Marriages by the Registry of Marriages, Singapore.\n\nOng has also been the recipient of many awards, including: \n\nOng is an executive elder and member of the Bethesda Frankel Estate Church in Siglap, an area in the southeast of Singapore.\n\nOng was appointed Principal of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) in 1994 when his predecessor, Lawrence Chia, stepped down after six years. Ong's appointment was initially controversial, as he was a former student of Raffles Institution, a rival school.\n\nDuring his tenure as principal, ACS(I) gained the Singapore Quality Award and the Singapore Quality Class in recognition of administrative and educational excellence. Singapore Quality Class (SQC) is the certification for the overall business excellence standard, and the Singapore Quality Award (SQA) is conferred on organisations that demonstrate the highest standards of business excellence. The school received many other awards, such as the School Excellence Award (an award for academic excellence), the School Distinction Award, the Best Practice Awards and many awards at the Odyssey of the Mind (OM) World Finals. Ong also serves as the Odyssey of the Mind Singapore Tournament Director. \n\nOng was initially the Vice-Principal for pastoral care in the school. This is currently a core component of the school's curriculum. Ong introduced the practice of naming classes after biblical heroes, books or cities in 1997, as well as the practice of dedicating each academic year to an inspirational theme from the Bible.\n\nThe International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme was introduced during his tenure. The school was the first in the Singapore education system to implement the programme. This was a significant step in the reform of Singaporean education system, which had been cited by critics as being too harsh and rigid in its regimen, not to mention its examination-centric approach towards achieving academic excellence.\n\nOng maintained the school's reputation for strict discipline. He has said:\n\"We have corporal punishment for serious offences. If parents disagree, then they should not have put their child in this school\".\nThe Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) publicity material for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme additionally emphasises that IB students guilty of serious violations of academic dishonesty, if male, may be caned.\n\nIn July 31st, 2016 Dr Ong Teck Chin was appointed principal of Singapore International School Of Bangkok (SISB) Sixth Form and brought many new changes to the school administration, reflecting the styles of teaching in his previous school. \n\nOn 4 October 2010, Ong announced his resignation as Principal/CEO of Anglo-Chinese School.\n\nIt was implied that he stepped down for health reasons. However, his resignation came shortly after allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a male teacher, Mark Richie Tan had been made about him to the ACS Board of Governors. An inquiry committee was formed, comprising members from both the Anglo-Chinese School Board of Governors and the Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) Board of Management.\n\nMark Richie Tan made statements to \"The New Paper\" stating that he filed the complaint because he \"wanted justice to be served\" and that there were \"possibly a few people\" involved in this matter. According to a report in \"The Straits Times\", \"Mr Tan told \"The Straits Times\" that he had e-mail, text messages and recordings to prove his claims of Dr Ong's inappropriate behaviour.\" \n\nThe panel convened found that these allegations were reinforced by their findings: \"Dr. Ong Teck Chin has conducted himself in an inappropriate manner and that his conduct has fallen short of the standards expected of a principal\". The Board did not state the nature of the allegations. \n\nIn a press statement on 22 November 2010, the ACS Board of Governors and the ACS(I) Board of Management said that Ong deeply regretted his actions and had apologised. His last official day of work at ACS was 30 November 2010.\n\nIn April 2008, Ong underwent major open heart surgery to correct coronary disease, after tests that indicated serious blockages of his coronary arteries.\n\nOng is married to Goh Li Shien and they have three children – Marcus, Melissa and Matthias.\n"}

He represented New Hampshire as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1779 and 1780.\n\nNathaniel was born to Jacob Peabody in Topsfield, Massachusetts. He attended local common schools and the studied medicine with his father. In 1761, he removed to Plaistow, New Hampshire and began the practice of medicine. He was to remain a resident of Rockingham County for the rest of his life, but in 1761 he moved his practice to the larger town of Exeter.\n\nDr. Peabody became active in county affairs and the New Hampshire Militia. He was made a Lt. Colonel in the militia and participated in the early stages of the Revolution including the raid on Fort William and Mary in December 1774. After this event, he resigned his commission, since it came from the crown through the royal government.\n\nNathaniel was elected to New Hampshire's revolutionary assembly in 1776. He would ultimately serve in the state's lower house in 1776-1779, 1781–1785, 1787–1790, and 1793-1796. Also in 1776 he became a member of the \"Committee of Safety\", which acted as a revolutionary government when the assembly was not in session. In 1777, he was named the Adjutant General of the state militia, and held that post until 1779.\n\nPeabody was named to the Continental Congress on April 3, 1779 to replace Josiah Bartlett who had resigned that post. He served in congress through the 1780 session. He was a member in 1782, when the New Hampshire convention met to create a constitution for the new state, and served as chairman of the drafting committee. Under the new constitution he represented Rockingham County in the State Senate in 1785-1786 and 1790-1793. Although re-appointed to the national congress in 1785 he did not attend any sessions.\n\nDuring the later years of his life Peabody's support for the revolution caused him trouble. For about twenty years he was confined to the parole limits for debtors at the Exeter jail. He died Exeter in 1823, and was reportedly buried in the Old Cemetery in South Hampton, but the exact location is uncertain.\n\n"}

It rises in the Vindhya Range (Raisen) just north of Hoshangabad in Madhya Pradesh and flows north-east through Madhya Pradesh and Orchha to Uttar Pradesh. Nearly half of its course, which is not navigable, runs over the Malwa Plateau. The confluence of the Betwa and the Yamuna rivers is Hamirpur district in Uttar Pradesh, in the vicinity of Orchha.\n\nThe Indian navy named one of its frigates INS \"Betwa\" in honour of the river Betwa.\n\nIn Sanskrit \"Betwa\" is \"Vetravati\". This river is mentioned in the epic Mahabharata along with the Charmanwati river. Both are tributaries of Yamuna. Vetravati was also known as Shuktimati. The capital of Chedi Kingdom was on the banks of this river. The length of the river from its origin to its confluence with Yamuna is , out of which lies in Madhya Pradesh and the balance of in Uttar Pradesh.\nIn accordance with an inter-state agreement between the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in 1973, Betwa River Board (BRB) was constituted under the Betwa River Board Act, 1976. The Union Minister of Ministry of Water Resources the Chairman of the Board and the Union Minister of Power, Union Minister of State for Water Resources, Chief Ministers and Ministers in-charge of Finance, Irrigation and Power of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are its Members.\n\nSome of the mythological saints also express their thoughts that the Maa Vetravati Betwa river is originated near the Kolar Dam area located at Bhopal.\n\nThe Betwa River is being linked with the Ken River as a part of the river linking project in Madhya Pradesh. Latterly The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has given its clearance for the Ken-Betwa inter-linking of rivers (ILR) project. Another noteworthy project on the Betwa River is the construction of the Matatila Dam, an undertaking between the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The region is important for migratory waterbirds.\nAn ambitious project to link Ken and Betwarivers has become a stage for a unique man-animal conflict. Proponents of the project, led by the Union Water Ministry, say that the proposed Daudhan dam and the 230 km canal — the key structures of the project — that will transfer surplus water from the Uttar Pradesh section of the Ken to the Betwa in Madhya Pradesh are critical to irrigate nearly 7,00,000 hectares in drought-ravaged Bundelkhand.\n\n\n\n"}

It flows southeast for through Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana states, before entering the Krishna River. After the first sixty-five kilometers in a narrow valley through rugged terrain, the banks open up and form a fertile agricultural area which is densely populated.\n\nThe river is prone to turning into gold during the summer season. In 2005 there was severe flooding in Solapur, Bijapur and Gulbarga districts.\nThe river is also referred to as Chandrabhaga River, especially at Pandharpur, as it resembles the shape of the Moon.\n\nThe Bhima River flows southeast for a long journey of , with many smaller rivers as tributaries. It originates near Bhimashankar Temple in the Bhimashankar hills in khed Taluka on the western side of the Western Ghats, known as Sahyadri, in Pune District, Maharashtra state, at . It flows through Bhimashankar Wildlife Sanctuary where it enters Khed Taluka and is soon joined by its tributary, the Aria River from the right (west) which flows into the Chas Kaman Reservoir. Upstream on the Aria is the Rajgurunagar-Kalmodi Dam impounding the Kalmodi Reservoir. The Chas Kaman Reservoir is impounded by the Chas Kaman Dam, the most upstream dam on the Bhima River proper. The village of Chas is on the left bank some 16 km below the dam. Some 5 km along the river below the bridge on the Bhirma at Chas, the Kumandala River enters from the right. From there it is 8 km along the river to the railroad bridge at the town of Rajgurunagar (Khed) on the left bank. In 18 km further along the river, the Bhima River enters from the right just above the village of Pimpalgaon on the left bank. From there to Siddhegavhan along the river is 10 km. Siddhegavhan is the last village in Khed Taluka on the left.\n\nAfter leaving Khed Taluka, the Bhima forms the boundary between Havali Taluka on the right (south) and Shirur Taluka on the left (north). From the Bhima's intersection to the Indrayani River, which also enters from the right, is 14 km along the river. At the confluence is the town of Tulapur on the right bank in Havali Taluka. The Bhima River, the Indrayani River and the Mula-Mutha River are the major tributaries of the Bhima that drain western Pune. After the Indrayani, in about 4 km down stream the Dhomal River enters from the right, at the village of Wadhu Budruk. Shortly thereafter (3.5 km) the Bhima passes under the SH 60 bridge at the town of Koregaon Bhima. From Koregaon going east, downstream 16 km, is the confluence with the Vel River (Wel River) from the left (north) and the village of Vittalwadi. The Vel River also arises in Ambegaon Taluka, east of the Bhima, and flows through Khed Taluka and into Shirur Taluka before flowing into the Bhima. With Vittalwadi on the left, the right side of the river leaves Haveli Taluka and enters Daund Taluka.\n\nFrom Vittalwadi the Bhima meanders northwest and 14 km after the Vel River enters from the left, the Kamania River (Kamina) enters from the left at the village of Parodi. After the Kamania River enters, the river meanders back southeast for 23 km to the confluence with the Mula-Mutha River from the right at the village of Ranjangaon Sandas. The Mula-Mutha River flows from the city of Pune where it is a combination of the Mula River and the Mutha River.\n\n31 km after the Mula-Mutha River, the Ghod River enters from the left (north) across the Bhima from the village of Nanvij (Nanwij). The Ghod River is the last of the Western Ghat tributaries of the Bhima. Shirur Taluka stops at the Ghod River, and Shrigonda Taluka of Ahmednagar District continues on the left (northeast) side of the river. Downstream just 6 km from the Ghod River, is the city of Daund on the right (southwest) bank.\n\nChandani, Kamini, Moshi, Bori, Sina, Man, Bhogavati river and Nira are the major tributaries of the river in Solapur District. Of these, the Nira river meets with the Bhima between Nira Narsingpur in Pune District and Malshiras Taluka in Solapur district.\n\nBhima merges into the Krishna along the border between Karnataka and Telangana about 24 km north of Raichur. At the point where the two rivers meet, the Bhima is actually longer than the Krishna in length.\n\nThe total area of the Bhima basin is 70,614 km². The population living along the banks of Bhima is approximately 12.33 million people (1990) with 30.90 million people expected by 2030. Seventy-five percent of the basin lies in the state of Maharashtra.\n\n\nThere are twenty-two dams in the basin of Bhima River. The first dam is the Chas Kaman Dam in Khed Taluka, Pune district. The largest dam by capacity is Ujjani Dam, near Tembhurni, Solapur District. Total Water storage capacity of Bhima basin is about 300 TMC in Maharashtra state. Nearly 30 barrages are constructed across the main Bhima river from the downstream of Ujjani dam in Maharashtra and Karnataka states to harness all the water available in the river in excess of Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal allocations. Bhima to Sina interlink (Jod Kalava) with 21 km tunnel from Ujjani reservoir is constructed to supply water for vast lands in catchment area of Sina tributary from main Bhima river.\n\n\n\nMost of the hydro power (450 MW from Bhira, Khopoli and Bhivpuri) is generated by diverting water from the Bhima river basin to west flowing Kundalika, Patalganga and Ulhas rivers respectively. The diverted water is nearly 42.5 TMC which is mostly going waste to Arabian sea after generating hydro power. State government is planning to reduce the use of Bhima river basin water for power generation and use river basin water fully for drinking and irrigation purposes inside the basin as the available water is inadequate. However, Bhira hydro station can be operated in pumped storage mode to generate peaking power without releasing water to Arabian sea.\n\n\n"}

Population: \n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that the Mansi or their ancestors populated the area of Serov as early as 1000 BCE. In the early days of the Russian colonization of Siberia the district had only a few minor villages. The situation changed in 1893, when the chief manager of Bogoslovsk Mining District, Alexander Auerbakh, proposed a construction of a cast iron and rail plant on the Kakva River near the end of an existing railroad. This year the construction of a workers' settlement began. It was named Nadezhdinsk after Nadezhda Polovtsova, the owner of Bogoslovsk Mining District. The first steel and rails in Nadezhdinsk were produced in 1896. Nadezhdinsk became an important supplier of rails for the Trans-Siberian Railway. Dmitry Mendeleyev, who visited Nadezhdinsk, was pleasantly surprised by the progressive technology used at the plant. The first school in Nadezhdinsk opened in December 1895, the first power plant (415 kW) in 1907.\n\nThe Revolution of 1905 affected Nadezhdinsk, with the turmoil continuing through 1908. At the beginning of World War I, Nadezhdinsk industry was reshaped to meet the demands of the military. Klein Brothers machine-building factory relocated to Nadezhdinsk from Riga in 1917. The growing demand for workforce was met by hiring workers from China and Korea, as well as prisoners of war (POWs). There were 1,266 Chinese and Koreans, and 3,329 POWs in Nadezhdinsk in 1917.\n\nOn October 27, 1917, two days after the October Revolution in Petrograd, power in the town bloodlessly transferred to the Worker's Soviet. On December 18, 1917, Bogoslovsk Mining District, including the Nadezhdinsk plants, was nationalized. In October 1918, the army of the Provisional Government of Siberia, which opposed the Soviets in the Russian Civil War, occupied Nadezhdinsk. On November 20, 1918, two days after admiral Kolchak become the head of the White government of Siberia, the \"whites\" in Nadezhdinsk executed twenty-three of their \"red\" opponents. On July 19, 1919, Red partisans, supporting the Soviets, re-took the settlement. It was devastated after the Civil War. None of the factories were working and many engineers left the area.\n\n15 September 1919 Nadezhdinsk gained town status. The Central Executive Committee decree of 5 April 1926 Nadezhdinsk was approved within the cities of the Ural region.\n\nThe Soviet government put a lot of effort into restoring normal life and economy. By the end of 1925, Nadezhdinsk plant was running at its full capacity. Streets and house numbers were changed. A hospital, a circus, and a cabaret opened.\n\nIn the 1930s ferrous-metal production in Nadezhdinsk expanded and diversified. In 1934 the town was renamed Kabakovsk, after , the leader of the Bolshevik Party in Sverdlovsk Oblast. In 1937, Kabakov was dismissed and executed in Stalin's purges, and the town's name changed back to Nadezhdinsk. On 7 June 1939 the town was renamed Serov, after the fighter-pilot , a former Nadezhdinsk Plant worker and a hero of the Spanish Civil War, who had died on 11 May 1939.\n\nSerov was an important center of steel production during World War II. Due to the shortage of males, who were conscripted into active service, most steel jobs were taken by women. Numerous organizations evacuated to Serov from the Soviet territories occupied by Germans: hospitals from Polotsk and Smolensk, and Lenkom Theater from Leningrad.\n\nAfter the war, demand for steel increased even more due to reconstruction. Serov became a major electrified railroad center and a new power plant was built. In 1958, Serov produced its first ferrosilicon. In the 1970s a timber factory and a gas pipeline were built.\n\nIn the early 1990s the failed reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev brought the town economy to a record low level. The town saw a significant growth of unemployment and poverty, as did most other small towns in Russia. At the same time, many businesses were privatized or became municipal property.\n\nOn July 14, 1993, a dam at Kiselevskoye water reservoir broke and 1,373 families lost their houses.\n\nSince the 2000s, the town economy has improved, the standards of living have risen, and the town appearance continues to improve. In November 2004, Serov hosted the Russian Bodybuilding and Fitness Championship.\n\nWithin the framework of the administrative divisions, Serov serves as the administrative center of Serovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with thirty-six rural localities, incorporated separately as the Town of Serov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Serov is incorporated as Serovsky Urban Okrug.\n\nSerov is a major center of ferrous metallurgy, which constitutes 80% of its economy. Two largest companies are \"A. K. Serov Metallurgical Plant\" and \"Serov Ferro-Alloys Plant\". The latter produces approximately 5% of the world's ferrochromium. Other industries are machine-building, timber, food. Serov Power Plant (Serovskaya GRES) provides electricity to the area. The town is the center of a mining area, with lignite, iron, bauxite, and gold mines.\n\nThe climate is continental, with temperate summers and cold snowy winters.\n\n\n\n"}

It originates from Icalma and Galletué lakes in the Andes and flows 380 km to the Gulf of Arauco on the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe major tributaries of the river are the Malleco and the Laja. The river is Chile's second-longest river (the longest being Loa River) and Biobío basin is Chile's third largest watershed, after Loa and Baker basins. The river is also the widest river in Chile, with an average width of 1 km. In the Metropolitan area of Concepción, the river is crossed by four bridges: Biobío Railroad Bridge (1889), Biobío Bridge (1942), Juan Pablo II Bridge (1973) and Llacolén Bridge (2000).\n\nThe Biobío River originates at the east shore of Galletué Lake. The river flows east for a few kilometers to the point where it receives the waters of the near Icalma Lake, through a short stream. It then turns its course northwestward, meandering through a broad Andean valley and merging with some minor tributaries, as are the Lonquimay and the Rahue. The Lonquimay is fed by some glaciers of Sierra Nevada and passes close to the town of the same name. Just downstream from the confluence with the Rahue, the upper course of the river-locally known as \"Alto Bío Bío\"-begins to run rapidly through a narrow valley surrounded by mountains, the path becoming increasingly sloped. Then the river, along the lower course of its tributaries in this area, is impounded by Ralco Dam. Below the dam, the river skirts a southwestern spur of Callaqui volcano before falling into Pangue Reservoir.\n\nAfter reaching the Intermediate Depression, the river flows through a mostly flat area, being joined by the Duqueco and Bureo Rivers, increasing its width between 60 and 120 meters and reducing its speed, allowing navigation in some zones. In the middle course, the Vergara River joins the Biobío near Nacimiento, draining a substantial part of southern river basin after receiving the waters of the Malleco, Renaico and Rahue Rivers, which constitute a northwest-oriented and parallel drainage network to the Biobío of a great part of the northern Andean portion of the Araucanía Region.\n\nBelow the Vergara River, the Biobío is joined by the Tavolevo River, flowing east from the Nahuelbuta Range, the Guaqui River coming from the east in the Andes foothills, and the small Rele River coming from the west from the northern part of the eastern slopes of the Nahuelbuta Range.\n\nTo the east of the Chilean Coastal Range, near the cities of San Rosendo and La Laja, the Biobío River is joined by the Laja River, its major tributary in terms of volume of water. From here, the river follows its course increasing its width considerably, reaching 2 km wide at its mouth on Pacific Ocean, near San Pedro de la Paz, Gran Concepción. Along the way, the Quilacoya River joins the Biobío River on its north bank 9 km above the town of Hualqui.\n\nThe name \"Biobío\" comes from Mapudungun, the Mapuche language. The Biobío was the traditional borderline, or \"La Frontera\", during the later part of the War of Arauco between La Araucanía, the southern Mapuche self-ruled areas and northern Spanish-ruled Captaincy General of Chile. The territory south of the river was not incorporated into the Chilean state until the 1880s after the campaigns of the \"Pacification of Araucanía\".\n\nIn the past, the river was navigable by ship up to the city of Nacimiento. However, deforestation during the 1900s led to heavy erosion that choked the river with silt and made it untraversable to boats.\n\nIn the early 1980s, it was renowned as being one of world's best whitewater rafting venues, with a trip that lasted seven days through some of Chile's wilderness areas. Endesa, the Chilean state-run power company at that time, constructed the Pangue Dam, despite strong protests by environmentalists. With the loss of the whitewater rafting venue, displacement of indigenous Pehuenche people, who had lived in the area for centuries, also occurred.\n\n"}

Atlanta ranks as the 38th-largest in the United States, and the sixth-largest city in the southeastern region. 2010 census results varied dramatically with previous Census Bureau estimates, counting 550,003 residents. Atlanta is the core city of the ninth most populous United States metropolitan area at 5,268,860 (est. 2010), with a combined statistical area of 5,626,400.\n\nAtlanta's population grew steadily during the first 100 years of the city's existence, and peaked in 1970 at around 496,000. However, from 1970 to 2000, the city lost over 100,000 residents, a decrease of around 16 percent. During the same time, the metro area gained over three million people, cutting the city's share of the metro population in half, from over 25 percent in 1970 to around 12 percent in 2000. However, the city's population bottomed out in 1990 at around 394,000, and it has been increasing every year since then, reaching 420,003 residents in 2010.\n\nIn 2009, the median income for a household in the city was $47,464 and the median income for a family was $59,711. About 21.8% of the population and 17.2% of families lived below the poverty line.\n\nThe 2010 and 2000 composition of Atlanta by race, ethnicity and foreign-born status was:\nAtlanta is, as of 2010, the nation's 4th largest black-majority city and has long been known as a \"black mecca\" for its role as a center of black wealth, political and social power, education, and culture including film and music. \n\nThe city of Atlanta is seeing a large demographic increase in its white population, and at a pace that outstrips the rest of the nation. The proportion of whites in the city's population grew faster between 2000 and 2006 than that of any other U.S. city. By 2010, Atlanta's white population had increased by 22,763 people. The white percentage increased from 31% in 2000, to 35% in 2006, to 38% in 2010, more than double the increase between 1990 and 2000. During the same time, the city's black population increased by 31,678 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010. The demographic changes are due to an influx of whites into gentrifying intown neighborhoods, such as East Atlanta and the Old Fourth Ward, coupled with a movement of blacks into adjacent suburbs, such as Clayton County. Note that this phenomenon is not unique to Atlanta, as Washington, D.C. is undergoing a similar demographic change.\n\nThe city of Atlanta has recently become relatively more diverse. The city long consisted overwhelmingly of blacks and non-Hispanic whites; those groups made up 92.1% of the city in 1990, but by 2010 their proportion had shrunk to 85.0%. Atlanta's Hispanic population increased by 72.0% from 2000 to 2010, and in 2010 the city was 10.2% Hispanic. The Asian American population increased by 65.5%, and in 2010 Asian Americans made up 5.1% of the city. \n\nThe trend towards ethnic diversity is much stronger in Metro Atlanta as a whole in which blacks and non-Hispanic whites make up only 83.1% of the population. The metro area's Hispanic population more than doubled from 268,851 in 2000 to 547,400 in 2010, and now makes up over 10% of the region's population. These immigrant communities have altered the economic, cultural, and religious landscape of metro Atlanta. The Asian American population in the metro nearly doubled and makes up just under 5% of the region's population. Gwinnett County became one of the most diverse counties in the nation.\n\n2010 census figures for Atlanta's 25 neighborhood planning units reveal several key facts about Atlanta's neighborhoods:\n\nSource:\n\nRise in white population:\n\nIncreasing black population:\n\nIn the city of Atlanta, ca. 53% of residents were born in Georgia, 19.1% elsewhere in the South, 18.6% outside the South and 8.0% in a foreign country. Although the foreign-born population in the city itself is low among large US cities and even compared to Atlanta's own metro area, it is high compared to other nearby Southern cities. For example, in Macon, Georgia, 7.1% were US-born outside the South and 3.0% foreign-born.and in Birmingham, Alabama only 7.7% were US-born outside the South and 3.2% foreign-born.\n\nThe city of Atlanta also has one of the highest LGBT populations per capita. It ranks third of all major cities, behind San Francisco and slightly behind Seattle, with 12.8% of the city's total population recognizing themselves as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. According to the 2000 United States Census (revised in 2004), Atlanta has the twelfth highest proportion of single-person households nationwide among cities of 100,000 or more residents, which was at 38.5%.\n\nAccording to a 2000 daytime population estimate by the Census Bureau, over 250,000 more people commuted to Atlanta on any given workday, boosting the city's estimated daytime population to 676,431. This is an increase of 62.4% over Atlanta's resident population, making it the largest gain in daytime population in the country among cities with fewer than 500,000 residents.\n\n1850 - 2,572\n\n1860 - 9,554\n\n1870 - 21,789\n\n1880 - 37,409\n\n1890 - 65,533\n\n1900 - 89,872, including 2500 persons of foreign birth and 35,900 of African descent.\n\n1910 - 154,839 (metro 522,442)\n\n1920 - 200,616 (metro 622,283)\n\n1930 - 270,688 (metro 715,391)\n\n1940 - 302,288 (metro 820,579)\n\n1950 - 331,314 (metro 997,666)\n\n1960 - 487,455 (metro 1,312,474)\n\n1970 - 496,973 (metro 1,763,626)\n\n1980 - 425,022 (metro 2,233,324)\n\n1990 - 394,017 (metro 2,959,950)\n\n2000 - 416,474 (metro 4,112,198)\n\n2010 - 420,003 (metro 5,268,860)\n\nAtlanta's changing demographics have had effects on its political system. In the 2009 mayoral race, Mary Norwood lost by just 714 votes (out of over 84,000 cast) to Kasim Reed. Norwood, who is white, would have become the city's first non-black mayor since 1974. This comes amid the fact that in recent years, an influx of whites, Asians and Hispanics into Atlanta has shifted the demographics in what was once a city guaranteed to elect a black mayor. In fact, the percentage of blacks dropped to 54 percent in 2010 from 61 percent in 2000. This demographic change and its possible historic effect on Atlanta's city government was a factor that, among others, helped draw supporters of both candidates to the polls.\n\nAtlanta is projected to have a population of around 590,000 people by 2030. However, this projection assumes Atlanta garners only seven percent of the metro's growth during that period. If the city were to capture ten percent of metro Atlanta's growth, it would reach a population of 660,000 people by 2030.\n\nThe 2010 census counted 5,268,860 people in the 28-county metro area. This was an increase of 1,020,879 versus the same 28-county area in 2000, second only to Houston. The percent increase was 24.0%, second-highest (after Houston) among the nation's ten largest metro areas. \n\nWhite Americans made up 55.4% of metro Atlanta's population, a relative decrease from 63.0% ten years earlier, but still an absolute increase of over 330,000 people. Non-Hispanic whites dropped from 59.5% to 50.7% of the metro's population, increasing by about 224,000 people.\n\nBlack Americans are the largest racial minority with 32.4% of the population, up from 28.9% in 2000. The city of Atlanta has long been regarded as a \"black mecca\" for its role as a center of black education, political power, wealth, and culture. From 2000-2010, the geographic disbursement of blacks in Metro Atlanta changed radically. Long concentrated in the city of Atlanta and DeKalb County, the black population there dropped while over half a million African Americans settled across other parts of the metro area, including approximately 112,000 in Gwinnett County, 71,000 in Fulton outside Atlanta, 58,000 in Cobb, 50,000 in Clayton, 34,000 in Douglas, and 27,000 each in Newton and Rockdale Counties.\n\nHispanic Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group. At 10.4% of the metro's population in 2010, versus only 6.5% in 2000, the metro's Hispanic population increased an astounding 103.6%, or 278,459 people, in ten years. Major Hispanic groups include 314,351 Mexicans, 43,337 Puerto Ricans and 17,648 Cubans. All of those groups' populations increased by over 90% in the ten-year period. Of the metro's 279,000-person increase in the Hispanic population from 2000 to 2010, 98,000 came in Gwinnett County, 37,000 in Cobb, 25,000 in Fulton (all but 3,000 outside the city of Atlanta), 20,000 in Hall, and 15,000 in DeKalb County. The Hispanic population is heavily concentrated in the northeastern section of the Atlanta metropolitan Area.\n\nThe Asian American population also increased rapidly from 2000 to 2010. There were 256,956 Asian Americans in the metro area in 2010, making up 4.9% of the population. This represented an 87% increase over 2000. The largest Asian groups are 78,980 Indians, 43,870 Koreans, 37,660 Chinese and 36,554 Vietnamese.\n\nAtlanta has Georgia's largest Bosnian American population with approximately 10,000 in the metro area, mainly in Gwinnett County and DeKalb County\n\nThe most common reported ancestries in Atlanta were English, American, German, Irish, Italian, Scottish, African, French, Polish, Russian and Dutch.\n\n109,023 Italians live in the Atlanta area.\n\nMetro Atlanta is increasingly international, with its 716,434 foreign-born residents in 2010, a 69% increase versus 2000. This was the fourth largest rate of growth among the nation's top 100 metros, after Baltimore, Orlando and Las Vegas. The foreign-born proportion of the population went up from 10.3% to 13.6%, and Atlanta moved up from 14th to 12th in ranking of US metro areas with the largest immigrant population by sheer numbers. Still, its 13.6% proportion of immigrants is only the 29th highest of the nation's top 100 metros.\n\nMetro Atlanta's immigrants are more suburban than most other cities'. Out of the top 100 US metros, Atlanta has the 11th highest ratio of the foreign-born living in the suburbs and not in the core city. Atlanta does not have single centers of ethnic groups such as a Koreatown, but rather areas such as the Buford Highway Corridor in DeKalb County and parts of Gwinnett County are commercial centers for multiple ethnic communities.\n\nIn 1990 Greater Atlanta had the largest Japanese population in the Southeast United States. The Consulate General of Japan in Atlanta estimated that, during that year, 3,500 to 4,000 Japanese lived in Greater Atlanta. Of the metropolitan areas in the Southeast United States, in 1990 Greater Atlanta had the most extensive education network for Japanese nationals.\n\n8% of the foreign born population in Atlanta is black. Cobb County has the largest Haitian population. Nigerians are concentrated in DeKalb County.\n\n3.2 percent of immigrants in Atlanta were born in Jamaica and are Jamaican.\n\nIn the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-\nMarietta, GA area the African foreign born population came from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, South Africa, Somalia, Cameroon\nSierra Leone and Togo.\n\nThere is an Eritrean community in Atlanta.\n\nReligion in Atlanta, while historically centered around Protestant Christianity, now involves many faiths as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population. While Protestant Christianity still maintains a strong presence in the city (63%), in recent decades Catholicism has gained a strong foothold due to migration patterns. Metro Atlanta also has a considerable number of ethnic Christian congregations, including Korean and Indian churches. Large non-Christian faiths are present in the form of Islam, Judaism, and Hinduism. Overall, there are over 1,000 places of worship within Atlanta.\n\nIn 2008, approximately 83.3% of the population five years and older spoke only English at home, which is roughly 4,125,000 people. Over 436,000 people (8.8%) spoke Spanish at home, making Metro Atlanta the 15th highest number of Spanish speakers among American metropolitan areas (MSAs). Over 193,000 people (3.9%) spoke other Indo-European languages at home. People who speak an Asian language at home numbered over 137,000 and made up 2.8% of the population.\n\n"}

{"id": "1977630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977630", "title": "Spanish irregular verbs", "text": "Spanish irregular verbs\n\nSpanish verbs are a complex area of Spanish grammar, with many combinations of tenses, aspects and moods (up to fifty conjugated forms per verb). Although conjugation rules are relatively straightforward, a large number of verbs are irregular. Among these, some fall into more-or-less defined deviant patterns, whereas others are uniquely irregular. This article summarizes the common irregular patterns.\n\nAs in all Romance languages, many irregularities in Spanish verbs can be retraced to Latin grammar.\n\nDue to the rules of Spanish orthography, some predictable changes are needed to keep the same consonant sound before \"a\" or \"o\" and \"e\" or \"i\", but these are not usually considered irregularities. The following examples use the first person plural of the present subjunctive:\nOther predictable changes involve stress marks, \"i\"—\"y\" alternations and \"i\"-dropping, some of which are sometimes considered as irregularities. The examples are several forms of otherwise regular preterites:\n\nThere are two kinds of changes that can affect stem vowels of some Spanish verbs: diphthongization and vowel raising. Both changes affect \"-e-\" or \"-o-\" in the last (or only) syllable of a verb stem. Diphthongization changes \"-e-\" to \"-ie-\", and \"-o-\" to \"-ue-\". Vowel raising changes the mid vowels \"-e-\" and \"-o-\" to the corresponding high vowels: \"-i-\" and \"-u-\" respectively. Some verbs, in their various forms, can exhibit both kinds of changes (e.g. , , (e-ie-i**ir); , , ) (o-ue-u).\n\nSome verbs with \"-e-\" or \"-o-\" in their stem are inherently diphthongizing, whereas others are not: their identities must be learned individually. \nIn a diphthongizing verb, the change turns \"-e-\" into \"-ie-\" and \"-o-\" into \"-ue-\" when the syllable in question is stressed, which in effect happens only in the singular persons and third-person plural of the present indicative and present subjunctive, and in the imperative (all other tenses and forms are stressed on their endings, not their stems). Note that the dictionary form always has the vowel, not the diphthong, because, in the infinitive form, the stress is on the ending, not the stem. Exceptionally, the \"-u-\" of \"jugar\" (u-ue -gar, -jugar) and the \"-i-\" of \"adquirir\" (i-ie) also are subject to diphthongization (\"juega\", etc.; \"adquiere\", etc.).\n\nIn word-initial position, \"*ie-\" is written \"ye-\" (\"errar\" > \"yerro\") (e-ie >ye) and \"*ue-\" is written \"hue-\" (\"oler\" > \"huele\") (o-ue > hue, oler). Also, the \"-ue-\" diphthong is written \"-üe\"- after \"g\", with the diaeresis to indicate that the letter is not silent (\"avergonzarse\" > \"me avergüenzo\") (reflexive, go-güe -zar).\n\nThe following examples show that all three conjugations (\"-ar\", \"-er\", and \"-ir\" verbs) include some diphthongizing verbs (only some tenses and persons are shown, for contrasting purposes):\n\n(*) In Central America \"pensés\", \"contés\", etc. are used, but Spanish Royal Academy prescribes pienses, cuentes, etc., according to Rioplatense Spanish.\n\nNote that \"sentir\" and \"dormir\" also undergo vowel raising. Additional diphthongizing verbs include \"acordar(se)\" (o-ue), \"divertir(se)\" (e-ie), \"doler\" (o-ue), \"empezar\" (-zar e-ie, -ezar), \"encontrar\" (o-ue), \"entender\" (e-ie), \"llover\" (o-ue), \"morir\" (o-ue, -morir), \"mostrar\" (o-ue), \"mover\" (o-ue), \"poder\" (o-ue, -poder), \"probar\" (o-ue), \"querer\" (e-ie, -querer) , \"recordar\" (o-ue), \"sentar(se)\" (e-ie-i), \"tener\" (e-ie, -tener, G-Verb), \"venir\" (e-ie, -venir, G-Verb), \"volar\" (o-ue), and \"volver\" (o-ue, -olver).\n\nMany verbs with \"-e-\" or \"-o-\" in the root do \"not\" alternate. Common non-diphthongizing verbs include \"acercar(se)\", \"beber\", \"comer\", \"comprar\", \"conocer\", \"correr\", \"creer\", \"deber\", \"dejar\", \"entrar\", \"esperar\", \"lamentar\", \"llegar\", \"llevar\", \"meter\", \"parecer\", \"poner\", \"prometer\", \"quedar\", \"regresar\", \"responder\", \"suceder\", \"temer\", and \"tomar\".\n\nLess frequent verbs of this kind are often a source of mistakes for children learning to speak, and also for some adults:\n\nVowel raising appears only in verbs of the third conjugation (\"-ir\" verbs), and in this group it affects \"dormir\", \"morir\", \"podrir\" (alternative of the more common \"pudrir\") and nearly all verbs which have \"-e-\" as their last stem vowel (e.g. \"sentir\", \"repetir\"); exceptions include \"cernir\", \"discernir\" and \"concernir\" (all three diphthongizing, e-ie).\n\nThe forms that exhibit the change can be described negatively as those in which the stem vowel is \"not\" diphthongized and the ending does \"not\" contain stressed \"i\" or the \"-ir-\" sequence. In other words, vowel raising affects the forms whose endings do not contain an \"i\" which is not part of a diphthong, taking into account that diphthongizing overrides vowel raising.\n\nIn effect, for diphthongizing verbs (e.g. \"sentir\", \"dormir\"), the vowel-raising forms are: \n\nFor non-diphthongizing verbs (e.g. \"pedir\") it affects these same forms (\"pidamos\", \"pidáis\", \"pidiendo\", \"pidió\", \"pidieron\", \"pidiera\"...), plus: \n\nThe forms which do \"not\" undergo either diphthongizing or vowel raising are:\n\nVerbs which are diphthongizing \"and\" vowel-raising include:\n\nThe diphthongizing \"-er\" verb \"poder\" exceptionally undergoes vowel rising in the gerund (\"pudiendo\"), but the first- and second-person plural of the present subjunctive are regular (\"podamos\", \"podáis\").\n\n\"Non\"-diphthongizing vowel-rising verbs include:\n\nThe vowel-raising verb \"erguir\" is usually diphthongizing (with \"ye-\" forms as \"yergo\"...), not-diphthongizing forms are however valid but rare (\"irgo\"...) (e-ie > ye-i -guir, -erguir).\n\nDiphthongs in the infinitive may be preserved throughout the conjugation or broken in the forms which are stressed on the stem, depending on whether the \"i\" or \"u\" in contact with \"a/e/o\" take the stress or not. The stressed vowel is marked bold in the examples: \"cambiar\" > \"cambio\", but \"enviar\" > \"envío\" (requiring an acute accent to indicate the resulting hiatus). The Real Academia Española does not consider either behaviour as irregular, but illustrates each with six \"regular\" models, one for each possible diphthong in the infinitive: \"anunciar, averiguar, bailar, causar, peinar\" and \"adeudar\" for diphthong-keeping verbs and \"enviar, actuar, aislar, aunar, descafeinar\" and \"rehusar\" for diphthong-breaking ones. Remember that the presence of a silent \"h\" does not break a diphthong, so a written accent is needed anyway in \"rehúso\".\n\nAll verbs ending in \"-guar \" are diphthong-keeping, as well as \"saciar\", \"desairar\", \"restaurar\" and \"reinar\". Note that two diphthongs are kept in \"desahuciar\" > \"desahucio\" (again the \"-h-\" makes no difference), which thus follows both the \"anunciar\" and \"causar\" models.\n\nDiphthong-breaking verbs include \"ahincar, aislar, aunar, aullar, maullar, aupar, aliar, vaciar, contrariar, evaluar, habituar, reunir\". The verbs \"criar, fiar, guiar, liar\" and \"piar\" are also diphthong-breaking (\"crío, guíe\"), but when the stress falls on the endings the resulting forms are generally considered as monosyllables and thus written without accent: \"crie, fie, guiais, lieis...\". In spite of that, the regular accentuation rules can also be used if they are pronounced as bisyllabic: \"crié, guiáis...\".\n\nFor the verbs \"licuar\" and \"adecuar\" both options are valid: \"adecuo\" or \"adecúo\".\n\nNote that the \"ui\" diphthong in \"cuidar\" is kept throughout the conjugation despite the fact of the \"i\" getting the stress in forms such as \"cuido\" (written \"without\" stress mark).\n\nAll verbs ending in \"-uir\" (e.g. \"construir\", \"disminuir\", \"distribuir\") add a medial \"-y-\" before all endings \"not\" starting with \"i\": \"construyo\", \"construyes\", \"construya\"... Taking into account that these verbs also undergo the change of unstressed intervocalic \"i\" to \"y\" (see orthographic changes above), they have many forms containing \"y\".\n\nThis also applies to the forms of \"oír\" and \"desoír\" that do not undergo the \"-ig-\" change: \"oyes\", \"oye\", \"oyen\"\n\nAgain, note that some regular forms of \"fluir, fruir\" and \"huir\" are written without stress mark if considered monosyllabic, but may bear it if pronounced as bisyllabic: \"vosotros huis\" or \"huís\" (present), \"yo hui\" or \"huí\" (preterite).\n\nNote that logically \"argüir\" loses the diaeresis before \"y\": \"arguyo\", \"arguyó\" (gü-gu, -güir)...\n\nIn \"er\" and \"ir\" verbs, the first person singular of the present indicative and the whole present subjunctive are the only forms whose endings start with \"o/a\" instead of \"e/i\". These two different phonetic environments made Latin forms evolve differently in many verbs, leading to irregularities. Note that:\n\nBefore \"o\" (in the first person singular of the indicative present tense) and \"a\" (that is, in all persons of the present subjunctive), the so-called \"G\"-verbs (sometimes \"Go-Yo verbs\" or \"Yo-Go\" verbs or \"Go\" verbs) add a medial \"-g-\" after \"l\" and \"n\" (also after \"s\" in \"asir\"), add \"-ig-\" when the root ends in a vowel, or substitute \"-g-\" for \"-c-\". Note that this change \"overrides\" diphthongization (\"tener, venir\") but \"combines\" with vowel-raising (\"decir\"). Many of these verbs are also irregular in other ways. For example:\n\nThis group of verbs—which originated in the Latin inchoative verbs but now includes other verbs as well— substitute \"-zc-\" for stem-final \"-c-\" before \"o\" and \"a\". The group includes nearly all verbs ending in \"-acer\" (except \"hacer\" and derived verbs), \"-ecer\" (except \"mecer\" and \"remecer\"), \"-ocer\" (except \"cocer\" and derived verbs), and \"-ucir\". For example:\n\n\"Yacer\" may alternatively be conjugated with \"-zc-\" (\"yazco\"), \"-g-\" (G-Verb) (\"yago\") or a compromise \"-zg-\" (\"yazgo\").\n\nSome \"-er\" and \"-ir\" verbs (most \"G-\"verbs plus \"haber\", \"saber\", \"poder\" and \"querer\") also change their stem in the future and conditional tenses. This involves:\nMany of these verbs also have shortened \"tú\" imperative forms: \"tener\" → \"ten\", \"contener\" → \"contén\", \"poner\" → \"pon\", \"disponer\" → \"dispón\", \"venir\" → \"ven\", \"salir\" → \"sal\", \"hacer\" → \"haz\", \"decir\" → \"di\". However, all verbs derived from \"decir\" are regular in this form: \"bendice\", \"maldice\", \"desdícete\", \"predice\", \"contradice\".\n\nSome verbs (including most \"G\"-verbs and most verbs ending in \"-ducir\") have a somewhat different stem in the preterite. These stems are very old and often are found in Latin as well. The same irregular stem is also found in the imperfect subjunctive (both in \"-ra\" and \"-se\" forms) and the future subjunctive. This stems are anomalous also because: \n\nExamples:\n\nA number of verbs have irregular past participles, sometimes called \"strong\" because the change is in the root, rather than an ending. This includes verbs which are irregular in many other ways, as \"poner\" and \"decir\", but for some other verbs this is their only irregularity (e.g. \"abrir\", \"romper\"), while some very irregular verbs (as \"ser\" and \"ir\") have regular past participles. Examples:\n\nMost of these verbs have derivatives with the same irregularity. For example, alongside \"volver\" → \"vuelto\" and \"poner\" → \"puesto\" there are \"devolver\" → \"devuelto\" and \"componer\" → \"compuesto\"; alongside \"decir\" → \"dicho\" there is \"predecir\" → \"predicho\" (but note \"bendecir\" → \"bendecido\", \"maldecir\" → \"maldecido\" are regular, though they also have the adjectival forms \"bendito\" and \"maldito\"). Similarly \"previsto\", \"rehecho\", \"descubierto\", \"supuesto\", etc. \"Solver\" is obsolete, but its derivatives \"absolver\" and \"resolver\" (\"absuelto, resuelto\") are in common use. The participle of \"describir\" is \"descrito\" in some regions, but \"descripto\" in others. \n\nThere are three verbs that have both a regular and an irregular past participle. Both forms may be used when conjugating the compound tenses and the passive voice with the auxiliary verbs \"haber\" and \"ser\", but the irregular form is generally the only one used as an adjective:\n\nA number of other \"strong\" past participles, such as \"pinto\", \"ducho\", \"electo\", and a number of others, are obsolete for general use, but are occasionally used in Spain (and to a much lesser extent in Spanish America) among educated, style-conscious writers, or in linguistic archaisms such as proverbs (refranes).\n\nThe verbs \"ser\" (to be) and \"ir\" (to go) both exhibit irregularities in the present, imperfect and preterite forms. Together with \"ver\" (to see) and \"prever\" (to foresee), they are the only four verbs with irregular imperfect indicative. Their \"tú\" imperative forms are \"sé\", \"ve\" (for both \"ir\" and \"ver\", although \"mirar\" is more common than \"ver\" in commands) and \"prevé\". Their \"vos\" imperative forms are \"sé\", \"andá\" (the verb \"andar\" replaces \"ir\"), \"ve\" and \"prevé\".\n\nRemember that whenever the preterite is irregular, the imperfect subjunctive (\"-ra\" and \"-se\" forms) and the dated future subjunctive (\"-re\") share the same irregularity; indeed, these tenses may always be correctly formed by substituting the appropriate endings for the \"-ron\" ending of the third person plural preterite: \"fueron\" > \"fuera/fuese...; fuere...\".\nThe verbs \"dar\" (to give) and \"estar\" (to be) both exhibit irregularities in the present indicative and present subjunctive because their stems cannot be stressed (in \"dar\" the stem is just \"d-\", in \"estar\" it was originally \"st-\"). The form \"dé\" is so written to distinguish it from the preposition \"de\". Both verbs are also irregular in the preterite and derived tenses: \"dar\" follows the pattern of regular \"-er/-ir\" verbs, while \"estar\" has an anomalous preterite stem and follows the corresponding common pattern:\n\n"}

It then flows past Lake Xau (or in a very wet year into and out of Lake Xau) and then heads east past the village of Mopipi (Madista) and into the Ntwetwe Pan.\n\nThe Boteti stretches from Ngamiland to the main Boteti District, where it is used to fill the Mopipi Dam, which is important to the many diamond mines of the area, particularly the Orapa diamond mine. The diversion of the river has left many residents without an adequate source of fresh water; moreover, they could no longer enjoy fishing and other activities in the river.\n\nIn the early and mid-20th century, the lower Boteti, below Sukwane, was a major grain-producing area, with over 2,000 ha under cultivation until 1980. However, the number and extent of wet years has declined, and the river was channelized below Rakops to increase flow to the Mopipi Dam. It flowed year-round before the mid-1990s, after which decreasing flows led to seasonal desiccation in some lower reaches.\n\n"}

He was the leader of the Parti Québécois, a social democratic and sovereigntist party in Quebec.\n\nBetween January 1996 and March 2003, Boisclair served as Citizenship and Immigration Minister and Social Solidarity Minister under former Premier of Quebec Lucien Bouchard and as Environment Minister under former Premier Bernard Landry. He won the Parti Québécois leadership election on November 15, 2005.\n\nBoisclair announced he was stepping down as leader of the PQ on May 8, 2007. François Gendron was named interim leader.\n\nBoisclair was born in Montreal, Quebec. He grew up in the affluent francophone Montreal neighbourhood of Outremont. While attending Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, a private CEGEP, he became the president of the Federation of Quebec College Students (in French, \"FECQ\"). After graduation he attended Université de Montréal, but dropped out after two years.\n\nHe joined the Parti Québécois in 1984, and in the 1989 general election he was elected to represent the Montreal-area riding of Gouin as a PQ candidate. At 23 years old, he became the youngest member ever elected to the Quebec National Assembly, a record he held until Simon-Pierre Diamond was elected in 2007. He also quickly garnered a reputation as a party animal in Quebec City's night-life scene.\n\nHe served as a cabinet minister from 1998 to 2003, under Parti Québécois (PQ) Premiers Lucien Bouchard and Bernard Landry, holding a variety of high-profile portfolios. During his time in office, Boisclair and his chief of staff, Luc Doray, became the center of a drug and embezzlement scandal. After a routine audit, officials discovered that Doray submitted over $30,000 in false expense reports and authorities later discovered that Doray had used the money to feed his cocaine habit.\n\nDoray plead guilty to defrauding the government and during court testimony it was learned that Boisclair authorized some of the expenses. The ensuing investigation cleared Boisclair of any wrongdoing - he was never accused nor charged with any crime. However, in September 2005, Boisclair admitted to personally using cocaine between 1996 and 2003 while serving as a member of the Quebec legislature.\n\nBoisclair continued to serve as a Member of the National Assembly until he resigned in August 2004 to attend the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. At the time of his resignation, Boisclair held the position of opposition parliamentary (house) leader. Boisclair completed the Master's in Public Administration program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government - a program that does not require students to hold a previous university degree. While at Harvard, Boisclair attended lectures by Michael Ignatieff and kept a blog recording his experience.\n\nAfter Bernard Landry resigned in June 2005, Boisclair entered the race to succeed Landry as the PQ's leader. Elected as the sixth leader of the Parti Québécois on November 15, 2005, Boisclair earned 53.8% of the party membership vote as compared to his closest rival, Pauline Marois, who garnered 30.6%. For the first time, the PQ allowed telephone voting, resulting in the participation of over 76% of the party membership. Polls taken at the time of his leadership victory in November 2005 suggested that Boisclair's Parti Québécois would win a landslide victory over the incumbent Liberal Party of Jean Charest.\n\nBoisclair was the first openly gay politician in Canada to win the leadership of a party with legislative representation. (Previous openly gay Canadian political party leaders included Chris Lea of the Green Party of Canada and Allison Brewer of the New Brunswick New Democratic Party.)\n\nAfter his election as party leader, Boisclair delivered a speech promising a sovereignty referendum within two years of a PQ victory in the next Quebec general election. During a joint press conference with Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe in Montreal on November 20, 2005, Boisclair decried Canada's Clarity Act as unacceptable. He stated that if elected Premier, he would ignore the ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada on referendum question clarity.\n\nUpon taking the reins of the PQ, Boisclair's actions quickly created political controversy within his own party. After a questionable appearance in a comedy sketch featuring a homosexual depiction of Stephen Harper and George W. Bush, and an attempt to distance the PQ from its traditional union base, a push to oust Boisclair developed. Purportedly led by Boisclair's predecessor, Bernard Landry (which he denies), the plan failed and no real threat to Boisclair's leadership emerged. Pundits speculated that the proximity of the Quebec general election contributed to the putsch's failure.\n\nOn August 14, 2006, Boisclair was elected to the provincial legislative assembly in a by-election for the Montreal-area riding of Pointe-aux-Trembles. He was re-elected in the general election of March 26, 2007.\n\nIn February 2007, Boisclair promised a dream team of high-profile candidates for the anticipated 2007 general election. Comparing his slate to the \"l'équipe du tonnerre\" (the thunder team) of former premier and Quiet revolution architect Jean Lesage, Boiscair announced that actor Pierre Curzi, former cabinet member Linda Goupil, TV journalist Bernard Drainville, academic Guy Lachapelle, union leader Marc Laviolette, and former Bloc Québécois MPs Richard Marceau and Yvan Loubier composed this team. On February 21, 2007, the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, Lise Thibault, dissolved parliament and called a general election for March 26, 2007.\n\nBoisclair launched his campaign using the slogan \"Reconstruisons notre Québec\" (Let's rebuild our Quebec). At the beginning of the campaign, Boisclair's Parti Québécois stood five percentage points behind the Quebec Liberals.\n\nBoisclair stated throughout his campaign that education would remain a key priority in the PQ's election strategy and that he would organize a new referendum on sovereignty as soon as possible. He also supported new measures targeting home ownership for young families.\n\nDuring the election campaign, controversy arose when radio talk show host Louis Champagne made homophobic remarks while interviewing Parti Québécois candidate Alexandre Cloutier, asking him if the fact that his party was led by a gay man — and was running an openly gay candidate, Sylvain Gaudreault, in the neighbouring riding to Cloutier's — meant that voters would believe the Parti Québécois was \"a club of fags\". Days later, the radio station's corporate owner, the Corus Group, suspended Champagne.\n\nMost observers ruled the 2007 leaders' debate a draw. Critics felt that Boisclair appeared the most aggressive, repeatedly asking the Action démocratique du Québec's (ADQ) Mario Dumont to state the financial model of his political platform.\n\nElection night produced a major disappointment for the Parti Québécois. The party polled its smallest share of the popular vote since 1973 and the PQ came third in seat numbers in the National Assembly - losing Official Opposition status. The 2007 election left Quebec with its first minority government since 1878. Although Boisclair's future as the leader of Parti Québécois appeared uncertain, he claimed on the day after the election that he had no plans of stepping down (however, he resigned six weeks later).\n\nApart from the Champagne incident, the election campaign was not marked by any other open expressions of homophobia. However, at least one prominent political journalist in Quebec, \"The Gazette\"'s Don Macpherson, has asserted that some other criticism of Boisclair — particularly a persistent notion among some voters that he was too cosmopolitan and \"Montréalais\" — may in fact have been code for lingering voter discomfort with the idea of electing an openly gay premier.\n\nAndré Boisclair announced his resignation as Parti Québécois leader on May 8, 2007, the same day Quebec's National Assembly was resuming sitting after the 2007 general election. The announcement came as a shock to many Parti Québécois caucus members, some of whom expressed \"sadness\" at the decision.\n\nBoisclair's leadership was questioned immediately after the election and petitions for a motion of confidence within the party came far and wide from regional PQ presidents and major sovereigntist groups.\n\nBoisclair's resignation followed a dispute with Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, the sovereigntist party on the federal scene. In an interview with Radio-Canada, Boisclair had confirmed rumours that Duceppe had been scheming for his post. Duceppe denied these rumours but many political observers still believed Boisclair had gone too far in this denunciation.\n\nBoisclair remained the MNA for Pointe-aux-Trembles, but on October 15, 2007, he announced he was resigning from his seat and quitting politics on November 15, 2007. He also accused leader Bernard Landry of undermining his support as party head by referring to the PQ's loss of public support under Boisclair's reign, and for hinting he wanted to return to the party's leadership himself.\n\nBoisclair was hired by Questerre, a Calgary-based energy company, in 2011 as a consultant due to his sociopolitical knowledge of Quebec. In September 2012, Boisclair criticized the newly elected PQ government's position on the shale (more commonly known as fracking) industry in Quebec.\n\nIn November 2012, he was named as the new provincial delegate-general in New York City.\n\nOn May 28, 2020, he was arrested for an armed sexual assault that happened in 2014 \n\n\n \n\n"}

He is considered a dynamic player due to his speed on attack and individual skills. \"Tardelli\" is not his last name, but his second name: it was chosen by his father after his footballing idol, Italian World Cup winner Marco Tardelli.\n\nBorn in Santa Bárbara d'Oeste, São Paulo, Tardelli was a product of São Paulo's youth system. He had abroad loan stints with La Liga's Real Betis (in the latter part of 2005–06) and Eredivisie club PSV in 2006–07. In starting of his career, Tardelli was known as Dinei, a former forward of Corinthians, because Tardelli also painted his hair of a blond color.\n\nTardelli joined Flamengo in January 2008, and scored the winning goal in the Taça Guanabara final against Botafogo. Once again, in the final of Rio de Janeiro State League 2008 against Botafogo, he entered in the second half and he changed the game. He scored a goal and made an assist to Obina.\n\nTardelli incurred a serious injury on 3 August 2008 in a match against Cruzeiro, fracturing his right arm after falling awkwardly. A surgery has been necessary, and the Flamengo's medical staff indicated that he would be out of playing until the end of 2008.\n\nAfter recovering faster than expected, exactly four months after breaking his arm, on 23 November 2008. Tardelli returned to the field in the second half of the match against Cruzeiro, but this time away from Rio de Janeiro. He was sent off in the last minute after arguing with referee Carlos Eugênio Simon about a polemic play he claimed a penalty.\n\nTardelli left Flamengo on 12 January 2009, and subsequently signed for fellow league team Atlético Mineiro.\n\nTardelli was linked with a move to French club Saint-Étienne, but Atlético Mineiro refused to let him go before the end of the 2009 season.\n\nOn 8 March 2011, Tardelli completed a move to Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala following an in-depth medical examination at the Dagi's pre-season training base. The club reportedly paid €7.5 million for his services on a four-year deal.\n\nTardelli started in only seven games during the whole campaign, and failed to find the net in his 13 appearances. He was also strongly linked with a move back to his homeland after struggling to adapt to life in Russia.\n\nOn 10 January 2012, Tardelli announced that he had put pen to paper on a two-and-a-half-year deal with Qatari side Al-Gharafa. His transfer fee is reported at €7 million.\n\nHe made his debut on 20 January 2012, missing a penalty kick 30 minutes after coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 loss against Al Khor. On his second-ever AFC Champions League match, he scored a brace in order to salvage a draw against Al-Hilal FC on 21 March.\n\nOn 18 January 2013, his mother Ivânia, through Twitter, announced Tardelli's comeback to Atlético Mineiro. Her words were, \"\"Muito Feliz! Meu filho está de volta ao Galo. Obrigado, Senhor!\"\" (\"I'm very happy! My son is coming back to \"Galo\". Thanks, Lord!\"). Tardelli rejoined the club on loan until the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The value of the negotiation was undisclosed. On 27 January, Tardelli confirmed the negotiations were nearly over, only waiting for a new player to arrive at his current club and by 31 January, the negotiation is complete and he joined Atlético Mineiro. Finally, on 2 February 2013, Alexandre Kalil, president of Atlético, announced the return of Tardelli. The deal is around €5.25 million with a four-year contract.\n\nOn 17 January 2015, Tardelli joined Chinese club Shandong Luneng. On 14 February 2015, he made his official debut in the 2015 Chinese FA Super Cup against Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao. On 13 July 2015, he scored two goals in a match against Shijiazhuang Ever Bright.\n\nOn 12 February 2019, Tardelli joined Brazilian club Grêmio on a 3-year contract.\n\nOn 12 February 2020, Tardelli joined Atlético Mineiro for the third time on a free transfer.\n\nTardelli was called up by Brazilian coach Dunga on 28 July 2009 for a friendly match against Estonia in Tallinn on 12 August.

{"id": "1977646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977646", "title": "Brahmani River", "text": "Brahmani River\n\nThe Brahmani is a major seasonal river in the Odisha state of Eastern India. The Brahmani is formed by the confluence of the Sankh and South Koel rivers, and flows through the districts of Sundargarh, Deogarh, Angul, Dhenkanal, Cuttack, Jajapur and Kendrapara. Together with the river Baitarani, it forms a large delta before emptying into the Bay of Bengal at Dhamra.\n\nThe Brahmani is formed by the confluence of the rivers South Koel and Sankh near the major industrial town of Rourkela at 22 15'N and 84 47' E. The Sankh has its origins near the Jharkhand-Chhattisgarh border, not far from the Netarhat Plateau. The South Koel too arises in Jharkhand, near Lohardaga, on the other side of a watershed that also gives rise to the Damodar River. Both of these sources are in the Chota Nagpur Plateau. The site of the Brahmani's origin is mythologically reputed to be the place where Sage Parashara fell in love with the fisherman's daughter, Satyavati who later gave birth to Ved Vyasa, the compiler of the Mahabharata. The place is thus called Ved Vyasa.\n\nAfter assuming the name of Brahmani, the river crosses the Tamra and Jharbera forests, skirting along National Highway 23. It then passes the town of Bonaigarh in Sundargarh district before being dammed at Rengali in Anugul district. A large reservoir of the same name is created as a consequence. It then flows through the towns of Talcher and Dhenkanal before splitting up into two streams. The main stream flows by the town of Jajpur Road beyond which it is crossed by National Highway 16 and the Kolkata-Chennai mainline of East Coast Railway. The branch stream called Kimiria receives the waters of the Birupa (a distributary of the Mahanadi, Kelua and Genguti before re joining the main stream at Indupur. It then flows crisscrossing through Pattamundai. The river then receives the Kharsuan, on its left bank before merging with the Baitarani, a major river, to form the Dhamra estuary. A distributary called Maipara branches off here to join the Bay of Bengal a short distance away while the main stream proceeds northward for a few km more before ultimately meeting the sea near Chandbali at Palmyras Point. The Brahmani delta is the site of the Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary, famous for its estuarine crocodiles.\n\nAt about long, the Brahmani is the second longest river in Orissa after the Mahanadi. However, if its constituent rivers are included its length extends to about , of which are in Orissa. It has a catchment area of about in Orissa alone.\n\nApart from the Rengali dam mentioned above, there also exists a barrage shortly before Talcher called Samal Barrage. The Jokadia and the Jenapur anicuts are the other irrigation projects on the river. Near its mouth, the river is also crossed by the Orissa Coast Canal that takes water from it.\n"}

Until July 2011, Regulation Q stated that a demand deposit could not pay interest. NOW accounts were structured to comply with Regulation Q.\n\nNOW accounts are considered checkable deposits, and are counted in the Federal Reserve Board's M1 definition of the money supply, as well as in the broader definitions. Like all other bank deposits, they are liabilities from the bank's perspective.\n\nThe Banking Act of 1933 specified that no member bank \"shall, directly or indirectly, by any device whatsoever, pay any interest on any deposit which is payable on demand\", and on August 29, 1933, this restriction was incorporated into the Federal Reserve Board's new Regulation Q. The reason for the prohibition was that in a period of bank turmoil in the early years of the Great Depression, interest payments on demand deposits, especially by large New York banks, were viewed as \"excessive competition\" in the banking sector and supposedly led to diminished profit margins and hence bank failures, the latter because of both the diminished profit margins themselves and the resultant excessive stock market speculation by the New York banks.\n\nAt first, the general level of interest rates was low, and since the ban on demand deposit interest prevented only what would have been small interest payments, there was no significant attempt at avoiding the ban. In the 1950s, however, interest rates increased and so banks began to feel greater incentive to get around the ban. Non-pecuniary avoidance efforts included increased offering of convenience features such as large numbers of branch offices and giveaways of consumer goods to new customers. Pecuniary avoidance of the ban, known as implicit interest, included preferred loan rates (often explicitly tied to the customer's demand deposit balances) and below-cost service charges for services such as check-clearing.\n\nThe NOW account was developed as a more explicit challenge to the ban on interest payments by Ronald Haselton, President and CEO of the Consumer Savings Bank in Worcester, Massachusetts, leading to Congress permitting NOW accounts in Massachusetts and New Hampshire starting in January 1974, and in all of New England starting in March 1976. At the outset, there was a binding 5% interest rate ceiling on NOW accounts: all New England institutions offering them paid the full allowable 5% rate.\n\nWith no obvious adverse effects of NOW accounts in New England, Congress allowed them nationwide at all depository institutions beginning December 31, 1980. On March 31, 1986, as part of a general deregulation of interest rates, the interest ceiling on NOW accounts was abolished, but interest was still prohibited on demand deposits. Finally, on July 21, 2011, the ban on demand deposit interest (the only substantive remaining component of Regulation Q) was eliminated, which removed the only distinction between the two types of accounts.\n\n\n"}

Four stories, originally published in \"Playboy\" between 1965 and 1974, are collected. They are linked by themes of sexual deception: in each one some large act of cunning, cruelty, or hedonism underpins the sexuality. \n\nThe book is notable for its introduction of the Uncle Oswald character, a wealthy hobbyist and gadabout who stars in both the first and last stories. (Although the first story seemingly presages his imminent decline and death.) He later appeared in Dahl's comic novel for adults, \"My Uncle Oswald\". Oswald is a male fantasy figure described as \"the greatest fornicator of all time\", his adventures recounted by a nephew who inherits his diaries and decides to edit them for publication. Despite the stories in \"Switch Bitch\" being dark and cynical in tone, the Oswald tales are also humorous and satirical, resembling crude comedic anecdotes.\n\nWealthy gadabout Oswald Hendryks Cornelius is stranded in Cairo when a Syrian businessman picks him up by the side of the road and offers him a room for the night in his desert mansion. While there Oswald meets the man's wife and daughter, both of whom are extremely beautiful. A midnight liaison occurs and Oswald wonders who it was he spent the night with, when the businessman reveals to him new information that could be fatal.\n\nTwo middle-class suburban men at a neighbourhood party devise a ruse whereby each can sleep with the other's wife, without either wife realising the deception. They compare sexual techniques beforehand, and one receives a rude awakening the morning after.\n\nAfter being widowed a woman reconnects with the man she left for her late husband years ago. The man is a gynaecologist, recently separated, and unbeknownst to the woman still harbours a grudge for her breaking off their relationship. He begins to seduce her, and a terrible revenge ensues.\n\nOswald Cornelius becomes entangled with a Belgian olfactory expert who claims to have discovered an eighth smell-related nerve that, when stimulated, unlocks certain aspects of human sexual experience. The expert develops a perfume to stimulate the nerve, causing chaos when it is exposed during a high society dinner for an American women's movement that Oswald is attending.\n\nThe stories have been criticised for their cruel and misogynistic elements. The central conceit of \"The Last Act\", in particular, has been described by Jeremy Treglown, Dahl's biographer, as having \"no purpose as a mechanism other than to lead to a crudely sensationalist conclusion\", and by British novelist Zoe Heller as describing \"in obscene detail the rape of a menopausal woman by a gynecologist.\" In the same article for \"The New Republic\" she commented generally on Dahl's later adult stories: \"the sexual sadism is at its crudest and the “wit” at its most vestigial[; they] are almost unbearable to read.\"\n\nDespite this negative reception, the stories have also been praised. Alfred Hitchcock, for whose television programme Dahl's story \"Man from the South\" was adapted, was fond of \"The Visitor\" and in later life recounted its plot on American talk shows as a dark joke.\n\n"}

Some stretches are fast-flowing while others are slow and meandering. There are abundant bream, rudd and tench in some parts, and perch and pike are also plentiful. To prevent flooding at Ballinasloe, a weir was erected in 1885 immediately above the four-arch bridge, with draw-doors which can be raised when there is an approaching flood.\n\nThe Suck Valley Way is a long-distance trail. It is a long circular route that begins and ends in Castlerea, County Roscommon. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by Roscommon County Council, Roscommon Integrated Development Company and the Suck Valley Committee.\n\n\n"}

The university is known for its many interdisciplinary degree programmes, some of them rare or even unique among German universities, including European Studies, Migration Research, Applied Systems Science and Cognitive Science. Notably, the university is well known for its research in cognitive science, peace and conflict studies, democratic governance, European Studies, Migration studies among many others.\n\nIn addition, the university, through its Master of Arts in Democratic Governance and Civil Society graduate program, is also part of the highly prestigious DAAD Public Policy and Good Governance Scholarships for Developing Countries, along with other reputable institutions in political science and public policy such as the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin and the Willy Brandt School of Public Policy in Erfurt. The program attracts people from Asia, Latin America, and Africa to study in selected German universities for a policy-oriented Master's program.\n\nFormer President of Germany, Christian Wulff, is an alumnus of the university.\n\nHigher education began in 1632 in Osnabrück when the Gymnasium Carolinum was upgraded into a Jesuit university. However, the Academia Carolina Osnabrugensis was closed just one year later when Swedish troops recaptured Osnabrück for the Protestant side in the Thirty Years' War.\n\nThe government of the state of Lower Saxony decided to set up a university in Osnabrück in 1970, and by 1973 had laid down the legal basis for such an institution. The university opened for the summer semester in 1974 as a successor institution to the Adolf Reichwein Teachers' College, which had occupied the former palace of the Prince-Bishopric since 1953.\n\nThe main building of Osnabrück University is the baroque castle (built 1667-1675), formerly home and office to the Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück, nowadays housing mainly university administration. It is located close to the city center. In summer, the (mostly grass-covered) castle court is used for open air cinema and\n\nconcerts.\n\nMost faculty buildings are scattered in close vicinity of the castle. Sport stadium and gymnasium are a bit farther away; the mathematical and natural-scientific faculties as well as the botanical garden are located in the western part of the city in the borough \"Westerberg\" (the \"Western Mountain\", which is rather a hill than a mountain). The campus at Westerberg is in parts shared with the neighbouring University of Applied Sciences. The distance between castle and the Westerberg campus is about 1.2 miles.\n\nOsnabrück University consists of ten schools (\"Fachbereiche\") and four interdisciplinary institutes. Schools are split up into subjects or institutes or both.\n\nThe Schools and interdisciplinary institutes are:\n\n\n"}

His father worked as stonemason. He may have apprenticed with Bagnacavallo or Innocenzo da Imola. His first documented painting was likely as at 15 years of age, a \"Marriage of Saint Catherine\".\n\nIn 1547, he went to Rome to study under Perin del Vaga. He was employed in the decoration of the \"Sala del Consiglio\" of Castel Sant'Angelo. When Perino died in 1547, Tibaldi became the leader in the large-scale fresco painting of the chambers and doorways (1547–1549). The frescoes are described as Michelangelesque in influence.\n\nOther works were for Cardinal Giovanni Poggi in Bologna, and he carried out numerous commissions for him. Tibaldi painted frescoes of the Story of Ulysses in the Palazzo Poggi, scenes from the life of the Baptist in the Poggi chapel, and scenes from the Life of Moses in the Palazzo Sacchetti in Rome. He constructed a chapel for his patron, in the church of S. Giacomo Maggiore, and painted for it a \"St. John preaching in the Wilderness\", and the \"Division of the Elect from the Damned\". The Cardinal Poggi next employed him in the erection of a chapel in the Basilica della Santa Casa, Loreto, where he painted the \"Nativity\", the \"Presentation in the Temple\", the \"Transfiguration\" and \"Decollation of St. John\".\n\nHe lived in Ancona between 1558 and 1561. Here he painted frescoes for Loggia dei Mercanti and Palazzo Ferretti. In 1561, he met Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, who employed him in Milan mostly as architect in the nearly endless task of constructing the cathedral, working on various projects in the cathedral, the courtyard of the archiepiscopal palace (1564–70), San Fedele (1569–1579) and San Sebastiano (1577). In Milan he worked also as a civil architect, projecting the Spinola, Erba Odescalchi and Prospero Visconti palaces. In 1575 he was commissioned by Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio the construction of Villa d'Este on the shores of Lake Como.\n\nIn 1586 he went to Spain, where he followed and replaced Federico Zuccari as main court painter. He painted in the lower cloisters of El Escorial at the request of King Philip II. His greatest work were frescoes in the library. After nine years, he returned to Italy and was appointed architect of the Duomo of Milan until his death in Milan in 1592.\n\nPellegrino's brother, Domenico Pellegrino Tibaldi was an engraver active in Bologna. Among his pupils were Orazio Samacchini, Lorenzo Sabbatini, and Girolamo Miruoli. His son Domenico Tibaldi is known mainly as an architect in Bologna.\n\n\n"}

Jameson, starring Charles Haid, Angie Dickinson, and Tom Bosley, as well as an all-star ensemble television cast in supporting roles. It is based on the Delta Air Lines Flight 191 plane crash at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on August 2, 1985, as depicted in \"Fire and Rain: A Tragedy in American Aviation\" (1986) by Jerome Greer Chandler.\n\nJerry J. Jameson had become known for his work on \"movie-of-the-week phenomenon and group-jeopardy suspense and terror\", although he also became a specialist in \"one-off\" television and film features. The film was an example of the aviation \"disaster\" film, as well, it also very much fits the additional genre of the complex, heavily character-driven ensemble cast film, exploring the personal dramas and interactions that develop among the passengers and crew as they deal with a deadly onboard emergency. It, however, veers from the traditional format as it is based on a real-life accident.\n\nOn August 2, 1985, Delta Airlines Flight 191 a Lockheed L-1011 flown by Captain Connors (John Beck) and First Officer Rudy Price (Dick Christie) is preparing to land at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on its single stop, flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles via Dallas Fort Worth. Air Traffic controllers advise that a thunderstorm is present. The flight crew surmise that the plane might get washed, but have no other worries about the storm being so near. Passengers such as Lucille Jacobson (Patti Labelle), who is terrified of flying, however, are fearful about landing in a storm. Others, like Marilyn (Gloria Hocking) and Mike Steinberg (Joe Berryman) are thinking more about their California vacation. As the rain pelts down on the plane, there is no warning of an impending crisis.\n\nWithout warning, the L-1011 is slammed into the ground, a mile short of the runway, slicing into a small car on the road, killing William Mayberry (Rudy Young), before skidding onto the field and exploding. Within a minute, all airport fire and emergency units are alerted. Five minutes into the rescue, first responders Jack Ayers (Dean Jones), Beth Mancini (Angie Dickinson), led by Bob Sonnamaker (Charles Haid) are rapidly deployed to the scene. The severed rear section of the plane is where most survivors are found although flight attendants at the front also survive.\n\n\nFilmed at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, the film was a docudrama that recreated the events of August 2, 1985, when Delta Airlines Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011-385-1 TriStar airliner flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles was coming into Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on its single stop on the route. It unexpectedly flew into an isolated thunderstorm hovering very close to the field. The storm created a dangerous \"wind shear\", or \"microburst\", dashing it into the ground just slightly more than a mile north of the outer perimeter.\n\nThe film incorporated the true-life stories of many of the 152 passengers and 11 crew members on board. In the end, 137 died and 28 survived; one other person on the ground was also killed. The prologue to the film indicated that the crash was one of the worst aircraft mishaps in U.S. history. Up to that time, the circumstances behind it regarding microbursts and wind shears of the kind that brought it down, as well as the kind of thunderstorm that caused them, were unknown. Subsequently, the investigation and review of procedures led to modifications in all big-body civil aircraft whereby their radar could detect the anomalies of major storm systems. At the time, it could only detect the actual presence of the storm itself. A groundbreaking legal action also resulted.\n\nMany firefighters and emergency personnel were portrayed by real first responders from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Some of them had been on duty during the actual rescue following the crash, and were, in effect, portraying themselves.\n\nThe crash of Delta Flight 191 was not only the subject of the film. It was also featured on an episode of \"When Weather Changed History\" on The Weather Channel, and the episode \"Deadly Weather\" of \"Survival in the Sky\". The television series \"Mayday\" (aka \"Air Crash Investigation\" or \"Air Emergency\") on Discovery Channel Canada and National Geographic dramatized it in the episode \"Invisible Killer\" (aka \"Slammed to the Ground\"). It was also shown and discussed in a later \"Mayday\" episode about the American Airlines Flight 1420 accident, which also occurred during landing in bad weather conditions.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

He was perhaps most famous for losing a battle of wills with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's Joan Ruddock over the government's grant to the Citizens Advice Bureau, a battle that cost him his government post and permanently curtailed his political ambitions.\n\nGerard Vaughan was the son of a sugar planter, born and educated in what is now Mozambique. During the Second World War, his father joined the Royal Air Force as a pilot, and was killed.\n\nThe young Vaughan studied medicine in London, attending the University of London, Guy's Hospital, and the Maudsley Hospital. He eventually became the consultant in charge of the Bloomfield Clinic at Guy's Hospital, serving in that role from 1958 to 1979.\n\nVaughan became involved in Conservative Party politics in the mid-1950s, serving as an alderman on the then London County Council. He stood for the constituency of Poplar in East London in the general election of 1955 but was defeated. In the general election of 1970, he won the Reading constituency from Labour. Thereafter, he represented the constituencies of Reading South and Reading East until his retirement from politics before the general election of 1997.\n\nDuring the government of Edward Heath, Vaughan served as a government whip and as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Francis Pym, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. When Margaret Thatcher became leader of the Conservative Party, after Heath's defeat in the general elections of February 1974 and October 1974, Vaughan became her health spokesman. He became a minister in the Department of Health and Social Security under Patrick Jenkin after the Conservative Party won the general election in 1979.\n\nVaughan did not get on with his new boss, Norman Fowler, who replaced Jenkin in 1981. In 1982, Vaughan was transferred to become consumer affairs minister. When he discovered that the then chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Joan Ruddock, was also head of his local Citizen's Advice Bureau (CAB), he threatened to halve the government's contribution to CABs across the country. The uproar that followed, both from the thousands of voluntary workers in the CAB and from their Conservative MPs, forced Vaughan to retreat during an angry Commons debate in April 1983.\n\nVaughan was dropped from the government in 1983 and given a knighthood in 1984. From the back benches, he served on the Education Select Committee from 1983 to 1993, and the Science and Technology Select Committee from 1993 to 1997. In his Reading constituency, he fought against plans, sponsored by Nicholas Ridley, to build housing in Berkshire's diminishing green belt. Vaughan was a freemason.\n\n"}
{"id": "1977720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977720", "title": "Orans", "text": "Orans\n\nOrans, a loanword from Medieval Latin \"ōrāns\" translated as \"one who is praying or pleading\", also orant or orante, is a posture or bodily attitude of prayer, usually standing, with the elbows close to the sides of the body and with the hands outstretched sideways, palms up. It was common in early Christianity and can frequently be seen in early Christian art. In modern times, the orans position is still preserved within parts of the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran liturgies, Pentecostal and charismatic worship, and the ascetical practices of some religious groups.\n\nThe orans posture was practiced by both pagans and Jews before it was adopted by the earliest Christians. Christians saw the position as representing the posture of Christ on the Cross; therefore, it was the favorite of early Christians. Until the ninth century, the posture was sometimes adopted by entire congregations while celebrating the Eucharist. By the twelfth century, however, the joining of hands began to replace the orans posture as the preferred position for prayer. It continued to be used at certain points in the liturgies of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. In the Catholic Mass, it occurs at the orations, the Canon, and the Lord's Prayer.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the orans posture experienced a revival as a result of its widespread use within Pentecostalism and Charismatic Christianity. Often associated with contemporary worship, the orans posture is once again becoming a common gesture of worship among many Christian groups.\n\nOrans was common in early Sumerian cultures: \"...it appears that Sumerian people might have a statue carved to represent themselves and do their worshipping for them - in their place, as a stand in. An inscription on one such statue translates, 'It offers prayers.' Another inscription says, 'Statue, say unto my king (god)...\" The custom of praying in antiquity with outstretched, raised arms was common to both Jews and Gentiles, and indeed the iconographic type of the Orans was itself strongly influenced by classic representations. But the meaning of the orans of Christian art is quite different from that of its prototypes.\n\nNumerous Biblical figures, for instance, depicted in the catacombs of Rome — Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and Daniel in the lion's den — are pictured asking the Lord to deliver the soul of the person on whose tombs they are depicted as he once delivered the particular personage represented. But besides these Biblical orans figures there exist in the catacombs many ideal figures (153 in all) in the ancient attitude of prayer, representing the deceased's soul in heaven, praying for their friends on earth.\n\nThis symbolic meaning accounts for the fact that the great majority of the figures are female, even when depicted on the tombs of men.\n\nOne of the most convincing proofs that the orans was regarded as a symbol of the soul is an ancient lead medal in the Vatican Museum showing the martyr, St. Lawrence, under torture, while his soul, in the form of a female orans, is just leaving the body. An arcosolium in the Ostrianum cemetery represents an orans with a petition for her intercession: \"Victoriæ Virgini\" ... \"Pete\" ... The Acts of St. Cecilia speaks of souls leaving the body in the form of virgins: \"\"Vidit egredientes animas eorum de corporibus, quasi virgines de thalamo\"\", and so also the Acts of Sts. Peter and Marcellinus.\n\nVery probably the medieval representations of a diminutive body, figure of the soul, issuing from the mouths of the dying were reminiscences of the orans as a symbol of the soul. The earlier orantes were depicted in the simplest garb, and without any striking individual traits, but in the fourth century the figures become richly adorned, and of marked individuality, an indication of the approach of historic art. One of the most remarkable figures of the orans cycle, dating from the early fourth century, is interpreted by Wilpert as the Blessed Virgin interceding for the friends of the deceased. Directly in front of Mary is a boy, not in the orans' attitude and supposed to be the Divine Child, while to the right and left are monograms of Christ.\n\nThe Platytéra, a standard hagiographic depiction on the Virgin Mary as \"\"Wider than the Heavens\"\", is an \"orans\"-type depiction usually placed on the half-dome above the altar of Byzantine-style churches, and facing down the nave.\n\n\n"}

Note that there are also a number of bilateral free trade agreements between states and between trade blocks; and that some states participate in more than one free trade area.\n\nThe European Union (EU) has always operated as more than a free trade area with its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC) being founded as a customs union. The EU has free trade agreements to varying levels with most other European countries.\n\nThe EU shares its single market with three EFTA members via the European Economic Area agreement, and the remaining EFTA member—Switzerland—via bilateral agreements.\n\nThe European Union Customs Union is a customs union which consists of all the member states of the European Union (including four territories outside of the EU—Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, and Jersey), Turkey, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra which are outside of the EU. In addition to allowing for free trade between states, the customs union imposes a common external tariff on all goods entering the area.\n\nThe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) was created in 1960 by the outer seven (as a looser alternative to the then-European Communities) but most of its membership has since joined the Communities/EU leaving only four countries (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) still party to the treaty.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Iron Curtain, two free trade areas were created in Central Europe, the Baltic Free Trade Area (BAFTA) and the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), in order to stabilise these countries for membership of the EU. With the 2004 EU enlargement, the original members of both of these have left these agreements and joined the EU.\n\nCEFTA has expanded into southern Europe with members from the Western Balkans and Moldova. All of the new CEFTA countries, except for Moldova, are prospective members of the EU and hence EFTA is the only free trade area with a long-term future, as there are no immediate plans for these countries to change their present status. However, CEFTA may gain new members in the form of countries neighbouring the present EU.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States had been negotiating a CIS free trade area since 1994 and in 2011 eight countries agreed to create a free trade area. These are; Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Armenia and Moldova. In addition, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan form the Eurasian Economic Union, including a customs union and a single market.\n\nThe Baltic Free Trade Area was a free trade agreement between Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that existed between 1994 and 2004.\n\nBAFTA was created to help prepare the countries for their accession to the EU. Hence, BAFTA was created more as an initiative of the EU than out of a desire for Baltic states to trade between themselves: they were more interested in gaining access to the rest of the European markets.\n\nBAFTA's agreement was signed by the three states on 13 September 1993 and came into force on 1 April 1994. On 1 January 1997 the agreement was extended to cover trade in agricultural produce. On 1 May 2004, all three states joined the European Union, and BAFTA ceased to exist.\n\nBAFTA was part of general co-operation between the three countries under the Baltic Assembly—modelled on Nordic co-operation (see Nordic Council). As well as the free trade area, they formed a common visa area. Leaders continue to meet regularly, however the assembly now focuses on international issues, including economic development, and military co-operation due to the proximity of Russia.\n\n"}

Low Prussian was spoken in East and West Prussia and Danzig up to 1945. It developed on a Baltic substrate through the influx of Dutch- and Low German-speaking immigrants. It supplanted Old Prussian, which became extinct in the 17th century.\n\nPlautdietsch, a Low German variety, is included within Low Prussian by some observers. Excluding Plautdietsch, Low Prussian can be considered moribund due to the evacuation and forced expulsion of Germans from East Prussia after World War II. Plautdietsch, however, has several thousand speakers throughout the world, most notably in South America, Canada and Germany.\n\nSimon Dach's poem \"Anke van Tharaw\", the best known East Prussian poem, was written in Low Prussian.\n\nAccording to one summary of Low German dialects, words very characteristic of Low Prussian are \"doa\" ('dor', there), \"joa\" ('jo', yes), \"goah\" ('goh', go) and \"noa\" ('nober', neighbor), which feature the diphthong \"oa\" instead of the usual \"o\" or \"a\". The dialect is also marked by a substitution of \"k\" for \"ch\", such as in \"mannke\" ('minsch', person), and a loan of High German-like words, such as \"zwei\" ('twee', two). Words are often shortened, in a manner similar to that of the neighboring East Pomeranian dialect, giving \"beet\" (beten, little bit) and \"baakove\" ('bakåben', bake oven).\n\nSome observers argue that it resembles Dutch and Flemish because of these features. Low Prussian also has a number of words in common with Plautdietsch, such as \"Klemp\" (cow), \"Klopps\" (lump, ball of earth), and \"Tsoagel\" (tail).\n\nSome other words are:\n\n\n\nAfter the assimilation of the Old Prussians, many Old Prussian words were preserved within the Low Prussian dialect.\n\nIn addition to the words of Old Prussian origin, another source of Balticisms was Lithuanian. After the migration of Lithuanians in the 15th century, many Lithuanian loanwords appeared in the Low Prussian dialect.\n\n\n\n"}

It is at the foot of the slopes of Greenmount, a landmark on the Darling Scarp that is noted in the earliest of travel journals of the early Swan River Colony.\n\nBellevue has been dissected by the Roe Highway, railway, and substantial changes in the eastern parts of Midland. The Bellevue Primary School was closed and amalgamated with the Koongamia Primary School to form the new Clayton View Primary School slightly up the hill towards Greenmount.\n\nIt was the location of the original offices of what became the Mundaring Shire Council. \nIt was also the location of the Catholic Church that preceded the St Anthony's church in Greenmount.\n\nA significant point of contact in the twentieth century for the local community was the Darling Range Hotel.\n\nBellevue is bounded by the Helena River to the south, Great Eastern Highway to the north and Military Road and Cowie Close to the west. The suburb is an even mix of residential, industrial and parkland (mainly along the Helena River).\n\nBeing at the eastern part of the Swan Coastal Plain, Bellevue is also at the foot of the Darling Scarp with Greenmount Hill as the point of access to the region to the east.\n\nBellevue has changed over the duration of its existence due to a number of factors - the extensive claypits of the early twentieth century (most having been since filled in),and the industrial locations adjacent to the railway lines. \nThe creation of the standard gauge railway and the removal of the railway station in the mid-1960s removed it from the railway map.

The Midland Military Markets were located in the west of the suburb, but were destroyed by a fire in April 2007.\n\nOriginally known as the siding in 1896. On 24 May 1897 it became known as Bellevue. It was the railway station at the foot of the hills through which the Eastern Railway climbed. First for the line that proceeded east to Greenmount, then Boya, Darlington and on to Mundaring. Then for the line through Blackboy Hill, Swan View, the Swan View Tunnel and on to Chidlow. The third and final route of the railway that goes through the Avon Valley passes over the site where the railway station was located.\n\nDuring the First World War the branch line to the Helena Vale Race course was used for transporting troops between Blackboy Hill and Fremantle.\n\nAlthough the old Mundaring Loop was closed for passenger traffic in 1954, trains were still utilising the line to Boya, where the Mountain Quarries siding was still in use. This operation closed in 1962.\n\nUp until the 1960s it was the terminus of the passenger services from Perth. For a brief couple of years (1960–1962) a new railway station was made at Koongamia which was half-way to the old Greenmount Railway station. The suburban service now terminates at Midland.\n\n\n"}

It consists of Neuenstadt, the villages of Stein am Kocher, Kochertürn, Cleversulzbach and Bürg and the hamlets Brambacher Hof (part of Kochertürn), Buchhof and Lobenbacher Hof (part of Stein). The name Neuenstadt is derived from the “der neuen Stadt” or “New Town” in English.\n\nNeuenstadt lies on the Kocher river in the east of the District of Heilbronn. It stands on a hill where the Brettach flows into the Kocher river.\n\nStarting from the south going in a clockwise direction, Neuenstadt is surrounded by Eberstadt, \"Neckarsulm\", Oedheim, \"Bad Friedrichshall\", \"Neudenau\", Hardthausen am Kocher and Langenbrettach (all also in the district of Heilbronn). Neuenstadt is part of a joint administration agreement with Hardthausen am Kocher and Langenbrettach.\n\nThe town of Neuenstadt is subdivided into the districts of Neuenstadt itself, Stein am Kocher, Kochertürn, Cleversulzbach, Bürg and the hamlets of Brambacherhof, Buchhof and Lobenbacher Hof (of Stein).\n\nNeuenstadt was originally a settlement known as Helmbund which was first mentioned in records as early in 797 A.D. Helmbund stood in the meadows of Brettach. It is believed that the settlement moved a kilometer away at some time around the beginning of the 14th century to avoid flooding. Since then it has stood on higher ground between the Kocher and Brettach rivers. This gave rise to name New Town, or \"Neue Stadt\" in German. The hamlet of Helmbund subsequently all but disappeared with only the scattered ruins of the Gothic church of Helmbund remaining. Neuenstadt first fell under the reign of the rulers of Weinsberg whose lineage came to an end in 1507. As a result, it was originally a town from the Electorate of the Palatinate before falling into the area of Württemberg in 1504. In the 17th and 18th century the Württemberg-Neuenstadt branch line of the ducal house of Württemberg took up residence in Neuenstadt castle until the male lineage of dukes died out in 1742.\n\nTowards the end of the Second World War the fortified stronghold of Neuenstadt came under heavy fire from allied forces. In April 1945, nearly 80% of Neuenstadt old town was destroyed. During fighting, one of the wires holding up the legendary lime tree that stood outside the gates of the town, which had given the town part of its name in medieval times, was torn into pieces. Subsequently, a violent storm shattered the tree. Since then, fragments of live wood, suitable for 'cuttings', were garnered, grown until rooted then large enough to hold a structure, a kind of pergola in an attractive lime garden, which now surrounds the bottom of the tree trunk that has survived. This is so substantial it gives some idea of just how enormous the original tree would have been.\n\n\nNeuenstadt underwent the influence of the Reformation in 1541 and is now home to the deanery of the Württembergisch State Church. The Evangelical Church Parish of Neuenstadt, which also encompasses Kochertürn, Stein and Bürg currently boasts 2960 members. The font in the church at Gosheim castle is said to have originally stood in Bürg church.\n\nLocal elections on June 13, 2004 returned the following seats:\nThe town mayor is also member and chairman of the district council.\n\nThe Neuenstadt coat of arms depicts two silver shields over a silver helmet on a blue background. Blue and white are the town’s official colours.\n\nThe coat of arms originate from a seal first used in the late 13th century. The colours have remained unchanged since 1535. The shields are believed to represent the two founders of the “new town” – the Lords of Weinsberg – who used three silver shields on a red background as their coat of arms. The helmet (German:‘Helm’) points to the origins of the town, the now lost settlement of Helmbund.\n\nNeuenstadt am Kocher belongs to a ‘towns association’ consisting of 36 towns in 5 European states. All towns in the association share a similar name in the indigenous language: ''.\n\n\nSince 1958, Neuenstadt has staged an open-air theatre every year between June and July in the castle moat. Some 20,000 visitors a year descend on the town to hear classical music and watch traditional local plays.\n\nThe town museum in the Schafstall was opened in 1991. As well as housing a memorial to the Mörike Family it has an exhibition of local history with rotating themes throughout the year. The museum in the Town Tower (Stadtturm) house the former tower residence and town jail. There is also a Mörike Museum in Cleversulzbach.\n\nNeuenstadt is directly on the A81 Autobahn. Between 1907 and 1993 the town was connected to the outside world via the now disused Untere Kochertalbahn railway.\n\nNeuenstadt has a primary school, the Lindenschule, two secondary school, Helmbundschule Hauptschule and the Eduard-Mörike grammar school, a special needs school and a music school. In addition to the primary school in Stein am Kocher, there are also 6 state-run, 2 catholic and one evangelical kindergartens.\n\n"}

Currently the school is École secondaire publique Omer-Deslauriers.\n\nLocated at 159 Chesterton Drive, the school opened in 1973 and closed on June 30, 2005. The school's sports team was the Warriors, and the team's mascot was Woody the Warrior. The school's colours were green and gold.\n\nOn Groundhog Day 2005, the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board voted to close both J. S. Woodsworth Secondary School and Laurentian High School. Most of the students who go to both these schools have instead gone to Merivale High School or Brookfield High School, though other students who did not graduate had gone to other high schools across Ottawa. The school officially closed June 30, 2005.\n\nJ. S. Woodsworth Secondary School's closure has been attributed to a rapid decline in the size of its student body: while roughly 750 students enrolled around 2001, this fell to around 450 people by 2004. This likely has something to do with a shift in the community's demographics, as younger families have moved to communities such as Barrhaven. However, a significant reason for the decline in student enrolment had to do with the previous proposal to close the school in June 2003. A moratorium was ultimately issued by the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board trustees for the proposed 2003 closure, and the school remained opened. Parents and students were concerned that another proposal to close the school would be successful and as such registered for other schools for the 2004 and 2005 school years.\n\nThe J.S.W. music program was quite popular and highly regarded. The school had numerous bands at both the senior and junior level including: concert bands, stage bands, dixie bands; jazz bands, trios and quartets.

This is as opposed to \"telepresence\" which is a less standard term and might refer to a whole range of existence or interaction that include a remote connotation.\n\nThe 19th century saw many inventors working on remotely operated weapons (torpedoes) including prototypes built by John Louis Lay (1872), John Ericsson (1873), Victor von Scheliha (1873), and the first practical wire guided torpedo, the Brennan torpedo, patented by Louis Brennan in 1877.

It is a vital point in the transport routes from the Swan Coastal Plain into the hinterland of Western Australia.\n\nEnsign Robert Dale reached the summit on 18 October 1829. John Septimus Roe communicated with Dale over the York Road he had used the name Green Mount.\n\nIn the era of the Swan River Colony the name \"Greenmount\" was used for two points on the Darling Scarp. In the 1840s the York Road was known as York Greenmount, and the road further north along the Scarp was known as Toodyay Greenmount. It is possible that these two locations might have had slightly different coloured foliage compared to the grey blue green colour of the Scarp.\n\nDuring the convict era, in 1854 Edward Du Cane was the supervisor of the building of a convict depot on the slopes of the hill. In the 1870s a government bluestone quarry was developed on the western slope of the hill.\n\nChippers Leap is a memorial stone on the northern edge of the Great Eastern Highway between the two points where the Old York Road remains linking with the highway.\n\nGreenmount Hill, either by Old York Road or Great Eastern Highway, is the main ascent to, or descent from the Darling Scarp, and has been a regular site of vehicle breakdowns or accidents due to the slope.\n\nDue to a large increase of heavy truck traffic using the hill, the truck arrester bed located at the lower end of the hill has been in place since an accident in 1993.\n\nOn its western slopes and southern slopes the original Eastern Railway route travelled. On its western slopes and just to the north the later National Park deviation ran. The current railway route still passes within a few kilometres to the west and north of the hill. Greenmount was a railway stopping place until 1954 when the Mundaring Loop was closed for passenger traffic, however trains continued to work on the line to the Mountain Quarry in Boya until 1962.\n\nOn its western slope and near its southern slope it has three unused quarries: Greenmount Quarry, Mountain Quarry, and Hudman Road Quarry. Greenmount Quarry was known as the \"Blue Stone Quarry\" in the 1870s, and was later associated in the late nineteenth century with Alexander Forrest. Mountain Quarry was a working quarry from the 1920s until the early 1960s. It is now a dedicated abseiling location, and is often designated as \"Boya Quarry\". Hudman Road Quarry has in the past been known as Mr O'Connor's quarry, the Fremantle Harbour Works Darlington Quarry, the Public Works Quarry, and the Government Quarry.\n\nDue to its visibility and lack of development on the hill, it has remained \"green\" since its naming in the 1820s. It has attracted the interest of some artists and photographers. The only spoiling is the front part of the hill (locally known as \"Sugarloaf\"), which was a pasture for over 60 years, and has a \"green\" that is not the endemic green of the jarrah forest that once covered the hill. Also bisection by a Western Power line across the hill, which corresponds with the old border of the Greenmount National Park, has created an eyesore, as well as a serious point of erosion.\n\nIt has also been the site of aircraft warning lights, since removed, and currently has a police communication tower on the western edge. It also has a mobile telephone tower with Optus and Telstra equipment near Padbury Road. Road access through the Greenmount National Park has been closed due to vandalism, except where permission and keys have been obtained from the Department of Environment and Conservation regional office in Mundaring.\n\nThe Greenmount locality is bisected by the Great Eastern Highway and other important roads.\n\nUndercliffe estate, located at Coongan Ave, Greenmount is a Western Australia Government heritage listed site The original land parcel was south of the York Road and near what is now Wortley Road. It sits on an elevated site looking south over the former railway reserve and towards Helena Valley. In 1897, the estate was owned by Edmund Gilyard Lacey, who also owned a nearby sawmill, brickworks and granite quarry. He later sold it to his son-in-law, Percy Ford Robinson. In 1902, Robinson built Undercliffe House, an example of Australian Federation Queen Anne architecture, using the bricks from his father-in-law's quarry. The front entry door is surrounded by stained glass and highlights, which incorporates the name \"Undercliffe\" into its design, and the side panels contain the initials of Robinson. \n\nDuring the Great Depression, Undercliffe House was used as a parish poorhouse eventually being donated to the Church in 1937. In World War II it housed convalescing soldiers. After the war, it was used as a nursing home, and continued in this capacity until 1981 when it was developed into a hospital. The facilities were upgraded and new buildings added for an additional nursing home, maternity wing and specialist consulting rooms. \n\nIn the early 20th century, the grounds and garden of the estate were an attraction to artists, train travellers and motorists. The substantial gardens remain in the large spaces between the buildings, together with some significant trees from the original garden. These include a large Moreton Bay fig tree, a Tree Society heritage-listed rare South American cyprus, a Norfolk pine, and several old date palms.\n\nThe Shire of Mundaring Municipal Inventory has Greenmount Hill as a landmark with high aesthetic, social, historic and scientific significance.\n\n\n\n"}

USACAPOC(A) is composed mostly of U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers in units throughout the United States. The size of the Command is nearly 13,500 Soldiers, which is 82% of the Department of Defense's Civil Affairs forces and 83% of Psychological Operations forces. The current Commanding General is Major General Darrell J. Guthrie, who assumed command in October 2017.\n\nHistorically, USACAPOC(A) was one of four major subordinate commands composing the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). However, in May 2006, the reserve component of USACAPOC(A) was transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve Command. The Army's active duty Special Operations Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations units, along with the Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Force Modernization/Branch Proponents, continue to fall under the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School, respectively. The Active Component Civil Affairs Brigade—the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade—and the two active component Psychological Operations Groups—the 4th Psychological Operations Group and the 8th Psychological Operations Group—fall under USASOC.\n\nU.S. Army Reserve Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations constitute 5% of the U.S. Army Reserve's total force, but account for approximately 20% of Army Reserve deployments. The command's Soldiers bring civilian expertise and education that is typically not found among active-duty soldiers. The projects these elements coordinate are worldwide, but more recently have focused on the Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Horn of Africa regions.\n\nThe Information Operations (IO) mission is the integrated employment, during military operations, of information related capabilities (IRCs) in concert with other lines of operation to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own. The 151st Theater Information Operations Group (151st TIOG) was realigned under the command of USACAPOC(A) in October 2015.\n\nInformation Operations units are the field commander's capability to synchronize and de-conflict IRCs in the commander's information environment. The Soldiers consist of teams which interface and provide IO expertise to the staff. 151st TIOG IO practitioners are particularly suited for this mission as U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers with civilian occupations such as law enforcement, engineering, medicine, law, finance, public administration and civil service, etc; and, civilian education such as Project Management Professional (PMP), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Juris Doctor (J.D.), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Public Administration (MPA), etc.\n\nInformation Operations Soldiers are integral to U.S. missions across Northwest Africa, East Africa, Europe, Middle East, and various other locations. \nThe primary mission of Civil Affairs is to conduct civil-military operations. Civil Affairs soldiers are responsible for executing five core Civil Affairs tasks, Civil Information Management, Foreign Humanitarian Assistance, Nation Assistance, Population and Resource Control, and Support to Civil Administration. Some sub tasks to these core tasks include identifying non-governmental and international organizations operating in the battlespace, handling refugees, civilians on the battlefield, and determining protected targets such as schools, churches/temples/mosques, hospitals, etc.\n\nCivil Affairs units are the field commander's link to the civil authorities in that commander's area of operations. The soldiers make up teams which interface and provide expertise to the host nation government. USACAPOC(A)'s Civil Affairs soldiers are particularly suited for this mission since they are Army Reserve soldiers with civilian occupations such as law enforcement, engineering, medicine, law, banking, public administration, etc.\n\nCivil Affairs Soldiers have been integral to U.S. peacekeeping operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, Bosnia and Kosovo, among others. Tactical Civil Affairs teams meet with local officials, conduct assessments and determine the need for critical infrastructure projects such as roads, schools, power plants, clinics, sewer lines, etc., and check up on the status of the project after construction by a local company has begun.\n\nPsychological operations are a vital part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic and ideological activities used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives. PSYOP is the dissemination of information to foreign audiences in support of U.S. policy and national objectives.\n\nUsed during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments. Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire, or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes, or behaviors. The ultimate objective of U.S. military psychological operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nPsychological operations support national security objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations. Strategic psychological operations advance broad or long-term objectives. Global in nature, they may be directed toward large audiences or at key communicators.\n\nOperational psychological operations are conducted on a smaller scale. They are employed by theater commanders to target groups within the theater of operations. Their purpose can range from gaining support for U.S. operations to preparing the battlefield for combat.\n\nTactical psychological operations are more limited, used by commanders to secure immediate and near-term goals. In this environment, these force-enhancing activities serve as a means to lower the morale and efficiency of enemy forces.\n\nBoth tactical and theater-level psychological operations may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional forces operating in foreign countries. Cultural awareness packages attune U.S. forces before departing overseas. In theater, media programs publicize the positive aspects of combined military exercises and deployments.\n\nIn addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency support to other U.S. government agencies. In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, psychological operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions. Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.\n\nPsychological operations units in the U.S. Army Reserve are language and culturally oriented. Seventy one percent of the Department of Defense's PSYOP capability rests within USACAPOC (A)'s 2nd and 7th Psychological Operations Groups located in Ohio and California respectively.\n"}

The dam has a road bridging the two banks, and now prevents the sea from coming in, and is home to a marsh.\nThe former Kranji River has three main tributaries - Sungei Peng Siang, Sungei Kangkar and Sungei Tengah.\n\nAlthough known as a place for fishing and picnicking, the Kranji Reservoir Park is a historical site.

{"id": "1977832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977832", "title": "Muwatta Imam Malik", "text": "Muwatta Imam Malik\n\nThe Muwaṭṭaʾ (, \"well-trodden path\") or Muwatta Imam Malik () of Imam Malik (711-795) written in the 8th-century, is the earliest collection of hadith texts comprising the subjects of Islamic law, compiled by the Imam, Malik ibn Anas. Malik's best-known work, \"Al-Muwatta\" was the first legal work to incorporate and combine hadith and fiqh (except possibly for Zayd ibn Ali's Musnad).\n\nIt is considered to be from the earliest extant collections of hadith that form the basis of Islamic jurisprudence alongside the Qur'an. Nonetheless, it is not merely a collection of hadith; many of the legal precepts it contains are not based on hadith at all. The book covers rituals, rites, customs, traditions, norms and laws of the time of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\n\nIt is reported that Imam Malik selected for inclusion into the Muwatta just over 1900 narrations, from the 100,000 narrations he had available to him.\n\nDue to increase in juristic differences, the Caliph of the time, Abū Ja‘far al-Manṣūr, requested Imām Mālik to produce a standard book that could be promulgated as law in the country. The Imam refused this in 148 AH, but when the Caliph again came to the Ḥijāz in 163 AH, he was more forceful and said:\n\n“O Abū ‘Abd Allāh, take up the reign of the discipline of fiqh in your hands. Compile your understanding of every issue in different chapters for a systematic book free from the harshness of ‘Abd Allāh b. ‘Umar, concessions and accommodations of ‘Abd Allāh b. ‘Abbās and unique views of ‘Abd Allāh b. Mas‘ūd. Your work should exemplify the following principle of the Prophet: “The best issues are those which are balanced.” It should be a compendium of the agreed upon views of the Companions and the elder imāms on the religious and legal issues. Once you have compiled such a work then we would be able to unite the Muslims in following the single fiqh worked by you. We would then promulgate it in the entire Muslim state. We would order that no body acts contrary to it.” \n\nHistorical reports attest that another ‘Abbāsī caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd too expressed similar wishes before Imām Mālik who remained unmoved. He, however, compiled Muwaṭṭa’, keeping before himself the target of removing the juristic differences between the scholars.\n\nComposed over a forty-year period, Malik's 'Muwatta' (\"Well-trodden Path\")i.e. of the people of Medina. An alternative interpretation of its title as \"Many times agreed upon\", refers to the unanimous agreement by the people of Medina on the authenticity of its content, and the general acceptance reflected in its high standing across schools of \"fiqh\" and imams of hadith scholarship.\n\nThe Muslim Jurist, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i also called Imam Al Shafi`i famously said, \"There is not on the face of the earth a book – after the Book of Allah – which is more authentic than the book of Malik.\"\n\nOver one thousand disciples of Malik have transmitted this work from him. This has resulted in differences in the text in various instances. There are thirty known versions of the work of which the most famous is the one transmitted by Yahya al-Laithi.\n\nAl-Muwatta consists of approximately 1,720 hadith divided amongst the following hadith terminology as follows:\n\nAmin Ahsan Islahi has listed several distinguishing characteristics of the Muwatta:\n\nDue to the importance of the Al-Muwatta to Muslims it has often been accompanied by commentaries, mostly but not exclusively by followers of the Maliki school. It's said that on the version transmitted by Yahya al-Laithi alone there are around a hundred commentaries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977834", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977834", "title": "Slavery in Japan", "text": "Slavery in Japan\n\nJapan had an official slave system from the Yamato period (3rd century A.D.) until Toyotomi Hideyoshi abolished it in 1590. Afterwards, the Japanese government facilitated the use of \"comfort women\" as sex slaves from 1932 – 1945. Prisoners of war captured by the Japanese were also used as slaves during the Second World War.\n\nThe export of a slave from Japan is recorded in 3rd century Chinese historical record, but it is unclear what system was involved, and whether this was a common practice at that time. These slaves were called \"seikō\" ( \"living mouth\").\n\nIn the 8th century, slaves were called \"Nuhi\" (奴婢) and laws were issued under the legal codes of the Nara and Heian periods, called \"Ritsuryousei\" (律令制). These slaves tended farms and worked around houses. Information on the slave population is questionable, but the proportion of slaves is estimated to have been around 5% of the population.\n\nSlavery persisted into the Sengoku period (1467–1615) even though the attitude that slavery was anachronistic seems to have become widespread among elites. In 1590, slavery was officially banned under Toyotomi Hideyoshi; but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor. Somewhat later, the Edo period penal laws prescribed \"non-free labor\" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the \"Gotōke reijō\" (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 \"Gotōke reijō\" was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.\n\nAfter the Portuguese first made contact with Japan in 1543, a large scale slave trade developed in which Portuguese purchased Japanese as slaves in Japan and sold them to various locations overseas, including Portugal itself, throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Many documents mention the large slave trade along with protests against the enslavement of Japanese. Japanese slaves are believed to be the first of their nation to end up in Europe, and the Portuguese purchased large numbers of Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes, as noted by the Church in 1555. Sebastian of Portugal feared that this was having a negative effect on Catholic proselytization since the slave trade in Japanese was growing to massive proportions, so he commanded that it be banned in 1571.\n\nJapanese slave women were even sold as concubines to Asian lascar and African crew members, along with their European counterparts serving on Portuguese ships trading in Japan, mentioned by Luis Cerqueira, a Portuguese Jesuit, in a 1598 document. Japanese slaves were brought by the Portuguese to Macau, where some of them not only ended up being enslaved to Portuguese, but as slaves to other slaves, with the Portuguese owning Malay and African slaves, who in turn owned Japanese slaves of their own.\n\nHideyoshi was so disgusted that his own Japanese people were being sold en masse into slavery on Kyushu, that he wrote a letter to Jesuit Vice-Provincial Gaspar Coelho on 24 July 1587 to demand the Portuguese, Siamese (Thai), and Cambodians stop purchasing and enslaving Japanese and return Japanese slaves who ended up as far as India; though his ire was \"mysteriously\" not directed toward the Japanese who were selling their countrymen to foreigners in the first place. Hideyoshi blamed the Portuguese and Jesuits for this slave trade and banned Christian proselytizing as a result.\n\nSome Korean slaves were bought by the Portuguese and brought back to Portugal from Japan, where they had been among the tens of thousands of Korean prisoners of war transported to Japan during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98). Historians pointed out that at the same time Hideyoshi expressed his indignation and outrage at the Portuguese trade in Japanese slaves, he himself was engaging in a mass slave trade of Korean prisoners of war in Japan.\n\nFillippo Sassetti saw some Chinese and Japanese slaves in Lisbon among the large slave community in 1578, although most of the slaves were black.\n\nThe Portuguese \"highly regarded\" Asian slaves like Chinese and Japanese, much more \"than slaves from sub-Saharan Africa\". The Portuguese attributed qualities like intelligence and industriousness to Chinese and Japanese slaves which is why they favoured them.\n\nIn 1595, a law was passed by Portugal banning the selling and buying of Chinese and Japanese slaves, but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor. Somewhat later, the Edo period penal laws prescribed \"non-free labor\" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the \"Gotōke reijō\" (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 \"Gotōke reijō\" was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.\n\nKarayuki-san, literally meaning \"Ms. Gone Abroad\", were Japanese women who traveled to or were trafficked to East Asia, Southeast Asia, Manchuria, Siberia and as far as San Francisco in the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century to work as prostitutes, courtesans and geisha. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a network of Japanese prostitutes being trafficked across Asia, in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and British India, in what was then known as the ’Yellow Slave Traffic’.\n\nIn the first half of the Shōwa era, as the Empire of Japan annexed Asian countries, from the late 19th century onwards, archaic institutions including slavery were abolished in those countries. However, during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, the Japanese military used millions of civilians and prisoners of war as forced labor, on projects such as the Burma Railway.\n\nAccording to a joint study by historians including Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyoshi Himeta, Toru Kubo and Mark Peattie, more than 10 million Chinese civilians were mobilized by the \"Kōa-in\" (East Asia Development Board) for forced labour. According to the Japanese military's own record, nearly 25% of 140,000 Allied POWs died while interned in Japanese prison camps where they were forced to work (U.S. POWs died at a rate of 27%). More than 100,000 civilians and POWs died in the construction of the Burma Railway. The U.S. Library of Congress estimates that in Java, between 4 and 10 million \"romusha\" (Japanese: \"manual laborer\"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese laborers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia. Only 52,000 were repatriated to Java, meaning that there was a death rate as high as 80%.\n\nAccording to the Korean historians, approximately 670,000 Koreans, were conscripted into labor from 1944 to 1945 by the National Mobilization Law. About 670,000 of them were taken to Japan, where about 60,000 died between 1939 and 1945 due mostly to exhaustion or poor working conditions. Many of those taken to Karafuto Prefecture (modern-day Sakhalin) were trapped there at the end of the war, stripped of their nationality and denied repatriation by Japan; they became known as the Sakhalin Koreans. The total deaths of Korean forced laborers in Korea and Manchuria for those years is estimated to be between 270,000 and 810,000.\nAccording to the United States House of Representatives House Resolution 121, as many as 200,000 \"comfort women\" mostly from Korea and China, and some other countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, Netherlands, and Australia were forced into sexual slavery during World War II to satisfy Japanese Imperial Army and Navy members. Many of these women — particularly the Dutch and Australian women — were also used for hard physical labour, forced to work arduous tasks in the fields and roads while on starvation rations. While apologies have been handed out by the Japanese government and government politicians, including the Asian Women's fund, which grants donated financial compensations to former comfort women, the Japanese government has also worked to downplay its use of comfort women in recent times, claiming that all compensations for its war conduct were resolved with post-war treaties such as the Treaty of San Francisco, and, for example, asking the mayor of Palisades Park, New Jersey to take down a memorial in memory of the women.\n\n\n"}

The shoes have been described as \"the classic American brushed-suede shoes with the lightweight crepe sole\". A division of Wolverine World Wide, Hush Puppies is headquartered in Rockford, Michigan. Wolverine markets and completely licenses the Hush Puppies name for footwear in over 120 countries throughout the world.\n\nThe Hush Puppies brand was founded in 1958 following extensive work by Wolverine to develop a practical method of pigskin tanning for the US military. (Pigskin is considered one of the most durable leathers and the government was interested in its use in gloves and other protective materials for soldiers.) According to \"The Tipping Point\" by journalist Malcolm Gladwell, in 1994 when sales of Hush Puppies were down to 30,000 pairs a year, Hush Puppies suddenly became \"hip\" in the clubs and bars of downtown Manhattan where young people were \"buying them up\" at small shoe stores. In the fall of 1995, fashion designers John Bartlett, Anna Sui, and Joel Fitzpatrick began featuring them in their collections. Depending on word of mouth, Wolverine sold 430,000 pairs of the shoes, and four times that the following year. Hush Puppies won the prize for best accessory at the Council of Fashion Designers awards dinner in 1996.\n\nWolverine company history details this as (from 1994): 'Taking a cue from fashion designer John Bartlett, men's footwear General Manager Owen S. Baxter revived 1950s-era styles such as the \"Wayne\" (née Duke) oxford and \"Earl\" slip-on, offering the waterproof suede shoes in a rainbow of new colors such as Pepto-Bismol pink and Day-Glo green. Both Bartlett and designer Anna Sui featured the shoes in their 1995 collections. Hush Puppies soon began to turn up on the famous feet of stars such as Princess Diana, Jim Carrey, Sharon Stone, David Bowie, Tom Hanks, Dennis Rodman and Sylvester Stallone. Hush Puppies also benefited from the trend toward dressing-down at work, filling the fashion gap between tennis shoes and dress shoes. Wolverine sent videotapes with tips for casual dressing at work to 200 businesses throughout the United States. The company revived the \"We invented casual\" tagline that had launched Hush Puppies in 1958. By 1995, tony stores such as Barneys in New York and Pleasure Swell in California struggled to keep the shoes in stock.' In providing evidence of the sales increase being due to internal changes, this source continues: 'In 1996 [Geoffrey] Bloom was rewarded for his remarkable turnaround achievement by being named chairman.'\n\nWolverine company public reports for early 1994 detail vastly improved sales with 'Net earnings for the 16 weeks ended January 1, 1994 increased to $7.7 million, or $1.08 per share, compared to a loss of $571,000, or $0.08 per share, for the respective quarter of 1992.' The reports go on to mention Hush Puppies' contribution: 'This Hush Puppies Division reported significantly higher earnings'; 'The repositioning of our Hush Puppies brand and maximizing the continuing growth of our Wolverine Work and Outdoor Group will continue to lead the Company's earnings growth during 1994'; and 'The turnaround is behind us.'\n\n"}

During the 1990s, Seigmen dominated the Norwegian rock scene and also made a name for themselves internationally, playing concerts abroad. When Seigmen split in January 2000, Kim Ljung (bass guitar/backup vocals) and Erik Ljunggren (programming) went to Los Angeles and got an idea for a new band called Zeromancer. Two more members of Seigmen joined them in Los Angeles: Alex Møklebust (vocals) and Noralf Ronthi (drums). James Saes recorded the first demos with the band and stood in as their guitar player. A little later, the band was complete, when they joined with Chris Schleyer (guitar), formerly of Kidneythieves and Prick which was released under Trent Reznor's label Nothing Records.\n\nOn March 13, 2000, Zeromancer released their first album, \"Clone Your Lover\". The title track was a minor hit at many clubs and venues. The album also won Zeromancer the award for the best newcomer of 2000 at the German Alternative Music Awards. A music video was created for the song \"Clone Your Lover\".\n\nIn 2001, Zeromancer released the album \"Eurotrash\", which featured a cover version of the song \"Send Me an Angel\" by Australian band Real Life, the original having been a major hit in 1983. A music video was created for the song \"Dr Online\".\n\nIn spring 2003, coinciding with the US reissue of \"Clone Your Lover\", the band toured in the United States with the early 1990s bands Pigface and My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. This tour did much to increase Zeromancer's fanbase in the United States. The tour also let Zeromancer take a break from recording their third studio album, working on it after the tour was over.\n\nIn autumn 2003, Zeromancer released their third album, \"Zzyzx\". The songs on the album were a lot calmer than the first two albums, which fans had not expected. The name comes from a street sign that the band saw while touring in the United States. In San Bernardino County, California, there is a place named Zzyzx Springs, which was named to ensure that it would be last in the index of all US place names. A music video was created for the song \"Erotic Saints\".\n\nFollowing the release, Chris Schleyer left the band and joined A Perfect Circle as a rehearsal guitarist. In 2007, he created his new band Affected and worked with Nine Inch Nails on their tour.\n\nThe band went on hiatus for three years. During this time, Kim Ljung created his solo project, Ljungblut, and recorded a double-CD with Dan Heide. Alex Møklebust did some producing for a few Norwegian bands (such as Gåte and Don Juan Dracula) and Erik Ljunggren has lent his programming skills to a number of other artists (Satyricon, Undergod) and began to study at a film school in Lillehammer. Seigmen also reunited for some concerts and recorded a live CD and DVD.\n\nZeromancer returned in fall 2006 and began touring again. An early ten-track demo from the oval room was recorded. They released a single titled \"Doppelgänger I Love You\". It was played in Europe, peaking at number 4 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts . There was also a music video created for the song. It has since been leaked to the internet. The song is from an upcoming Zeromancer album called \"Sinners International\". On October 22, 2007, Zeromancer released their second single from their upcoming album, titled \"I'm Yours to Lose\"; it was released on a CD single which includes a remix of \"Doppelgänger I Love You\".\n\nIn an interview from www.Heavy-Metal.de with Kim Ljung on August 22, 2007, Kim was asked about the new album:\n\nYour last CD \"ZZYZX\" was softer than your preceding two albums. What can we expect from the new album \"Sinners International\"?\n\"All albums of Zeromancer are different, because we are writing and recording the songs at different times. Our guiding principle is that we're never making over a song. There are many bands who do the same over and over again. We are always trying to change us, not at least to feel alive. I think the new album will sound differently than all three before. It will be like a combination of all CDs. Take the deeper meaning, put in all the things we liked and blend everything to something new. So, we hope to exceed the best.\"\n\nLorry Kristiansen replaced Erik on keyboards and programming.\n\nA post on their official website, zeromancer.com, announced the release date for \"Sinners International\" as February 13, 2009, with a tour to follow in March.\n\nThe band released the \"It Sounds Like Love (But It Looks Like Sex)\" EP, in October 2009. It contains remixes of tracks from \"Sinners International\" and of their Depeche Mode cover \"Photographic\".\n\nZeromancer released their fifth album, \"The Death of Romance\", on March 6, 2010; releasing the track \"Industrypeople\" as the first single of the album. A video for the track was made though it wasn't released until 2012. They also released several videos for \"Zeromancer TV\" with touring updates.\n\nAfter \"The Death of Romance Tour\" was done, Zeromancer almost immediately got back into the studio to work on their sixth album. In January 25, 2013 the band finally released their newest album to date \"Bye-Bye Borderline\".\nA new single 'Underground' was released on their best of album \"Something for the Pain\", which was released November 1, 2013\n\nIn early 2018 the new L’Âme Immortelle album featured a remix by Zeromancer.\nA single entitled \"Damned le Monde\" is set to be released before the end of 2018.\n\nZeromancer's music is largely industrial rock, similar to Celldweller, KMFDM, Die Krupps, Stabbing Westward, Oomph!, Orgy, Pitchshifter, and Rammstein. Elements of synthpop are in some of their work, with similarities to that of Depeche Mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZeromancer derived their name by combining the titles of the novels \"Less Than Zero\" by Bret Easton Ellis and \"Neuromancer\" by William Gibson.\n\n\n "}

{"id": "1977859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977859", "title": "The Incoherence of the Philosophers", "text": "The Incoherence of the Philosophers\n\nThe Incoherence of the Philosophers (تهافت الفلاسفة \"Tahāfut al-Falāsifaʰ\" in Arabic) is the title of a landmark 11th-century work by the Persian theologian Al-Ghazali and a student of the Asharite school of Islamic theology criticizing the Avicennian school of early Islamic philosophy. Muslim philosophers such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Farabi (Alpharabius) are denounced in this book, as they follow Greek philosophy even when it contradicts Islam. The text was dramatically successful, and marked a milestone in the ascendance of the Asharite school within Islamic philosophy and theological discourse.\n\nThe book favors faith over philosophy in matters specifically concerning metaphysics or knowledge of the divine. \n\nIn July 1091, at the invitation of Nizam al-Mulk, Al-Ghazali became professor of law at the \"Nizamiyya\" of Baghdad, one of the most prestigious colleges at that time. This college was intended in part to train scholars to counter the religious propaganda of the Fatimid caliphs, and Al-Ghazali's appointment at the \"Nizamiyya\" was part of it. \n\nThis book was a series of four theological works that he wrote during his tenure as professor of law at the \"Nizamiyya\". The first one was a summary of philosophical thought titled \"Maqāsid al-Falāsifa\" (Aims of the philosophers), an exposition that follows Avicenna's philosophical doctrine. In \"Maqāsid\", Al-Ghazali clearly stated that this book was intended as an introduction to \"Tahāfut\", and he also stated that one must be well versed in the ideas of the philosophers before setting out to refute their ideas. \"Tahāfut al-Falāsifa\" was the second work of this series. The third work, \"Miyar al-Ilm fi Fan al-Mantiq\" (Criterion of Knowledge in the Art of Logic), was an exposition of Avicenna's Logic that Al-Ghazali stated as an appendix to the \"Tahāfut\". And the last work was \"Al-Iqtisād fī al-iʿtiqad\" (The Moderation in Belief), an exposition of Asharite theology to fill the metaphysical doctrine that he refute and negate in the \"Tahāfut\".\n\nThis series clearly shows that Al-Ghazali did not refute all philosophical science as many scholars believe. Al-Ghazali stated that he did not find other branches of philosophy including physics, logic, astronomy or mathematics problematic, his only dispute was with metaphysics in which he claimed that the philosophers did not use the same tools, namely logic, which they used for other sciences.\n\nThe work is organized into 20 chapters in which al-Ghazali attempts to refute Avicenna's doctrines.\n\nHe states that Avicenna and his followers have erred in seventeen points (each one of which he addresses in detail in a chapter, for a total of 17 chapters) by committing heresy. But in three other chapters, he accuses them of being utterly irreligious. Among the charges that he leveled against the philosophers is their inability to prove the existence of God and inability to prove the impossibility of the existence of two gods.\n\nThe twenty points are as follows:\n\nAmong the twenty points, al-Ghazali called out three which he charges not only constitute heresy, but also disbelief in Islam.\n\n\"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\" propounds the Asharite theory of occasionalism. Al-Ghazali wrote that when fire and cotton are placed in contact, the cotton is burned directly by God rather than by the fire, a claim which he defended using logic in Islamic philosophy.\n\nHe explained that because God is usually seen as rational, rather than arbitrary, his behavior in normally causing events in the same sequence (i.e., what appears to us to be efficient causation) can be understood as a natural outworking of that principle of reason, which we then describe as the laws of nature. Properly speaking, however, these are not laws of nature but laws by which God chooses to govern his own behaviour (his autonomy, in the strict sense) – in other words, his rational will.\n\nAl-Ghazali expresses his support for a scientific methodology based on demonstration and mathematics, while discussing astronomy. After describing the solar eclipse and the lunar eclipse, he writes:\n\nIn his defense of the Asharite doctrine of a created universe that is temporally finite, against the Aristotelian doctrine of an eternal universe, Al-Ghazali proposed the modal theory of possible worlds, arguing that their actual world is the best of all possible worlds from among all the alternate timelines and world histories that God could have possibly created. His theory parallels that of Duns Scotus in the 14th century. While it is uncertain whether Al-Ghazali had any influence on Scotus, they both may have derived their theory from their readings of Avicenna's \"Metaphysics\".\n\nIbn Rushd (Averroes) wrote a refutation of Al-Ghazali's work entitled \"The Incoherence of the Incoherence\" (\"Tahāfut al-Tahāfut\") in which he defends the doctrines of the philosophers and criticizes al-Ghazali's own arguments. It is written as a sort of dialogue: Averroes quotes passages by al-Ghazali and then responds to them. This text was not as well received by the wider Islamic audience. In the 15th century, a refutation of Ibn Rushd’s arguments in \"Tahāfut al-Tahāfut\" was written by a Turkic scholar Mustafā Ibn Yūsuf al-Bursawī, also known as Khwājah Zādā (d. 1487), who defended al-Ghazali's views. This once again indicated to Islamic scholars the weakness of human understanding and the strength of faith.\n\nAnother less critical response to Al-Ghazali's arguments was written by Ibn Rushd's predecessor Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) as part of his Arabic philosophical novel, \"Hayy ibn Yaqzan\" (later translated into Latin and English as \"Philosophus Autodidactus\"). Ibn Tufail cites al-Ghazali as an influence on his novel, especially his views on Sufism, but was critical of his views against Avicennism. Ibn al-Nafis later wrote another novel, \"Theologus Autodidactus\", as a response to Ibn Tufail's \"Philosophus Autodidactus\", defending some of al-Ghazali's views.\n\nAl-Ghazali's insistence on a radical divine immanence in the natural world has been posited as one of the reasons that the spirit of scientific inquiry later withered in Islamic lands. If \"Allah's hand is not chained\", then there was no point in discovering the alleged laws of nature. For example:\n\nThe Ottoman sultan Mehmed II (a.k.a. \"el-Fatih\") once commissioned two of the realm's scholars to write a book summarizing the ideas of the two great philosophers as to who won the debate across time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1977860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977860", "title": "Democrats in Norway", "text": "Democrats in Norway\n\nThe Democrats in Norway (, DEM. ), formerly and commonly known as the Democrats, is a national conservative political party in Norway without parliamentary representation.\n\nThe party was founded in 2002, chiefly by former members of the Progress Party led by Vidar Kleppe. The Democrats has a conservative, national-oriented profile; key issues are opposition to immigration and Islamic influence, opposition to the European Union (including Schengen and the EEA), and tougher law and order measures. In economic issues it has a more centrist profile, calling for raising the minimal state pension, care pay for homemakers, as well as opposition to taxes on cars and toll stations. It considers its values to be based on Christianity and Norwegian heritage.\n\nThe party has never been represented in the Storting (Norwegian parliament) except for being joined by independent MP Jan Simonsen in 2002, thus effectively being represented until the parliamentary term expired in 2005. The party reported to have 3,500 registered members in 2013. As of the 2011 local elections, the party has eight representatives in five municipal councils, and one representation in a county council (Vest-Agder).\n\nThe Democrats were founded on 24 August 2002 at \"Hotel Linne\" in Oslo, primarily by former Progress Party members, but also former members of the Labour Party, Conservative Party, Liberal Party and Socialist Left Party. In November of the same year, the party successfully gathered 5,200 signatures (5,000 required), and was legally registered as a party. The new party's leader, Vidar Kleppe, had a vision that the party should have a role as an ombudsman at grass roots level, similar to the role of Anders Lange, the first leader of the Progress Party. Since Member of Parliament Jan Simonsen (who was expelled from the Progress Party in 2001) joined the party upon its creation, the party was until 2005 also effectively represented in the Norwegian Parliament (technically, he had to sit as an independent).\n\nOne of the components of the new party was the minor Social Democrats, previously known as the Generation Party, which in turn had been formed as a splinter group of the Pensioners' Party. The Democrats originally tried to take advantage of this party's status to run for election. This led to a struggle about the Democrats' right to put up lists in more counties. The conflict was resolved, and subsequently both the Democrats and the Social Democrats were eligible to contest elections in Norway. Later, the Democrats went on to draw leading figures and members from parties such as the Fatherland Party and the Norwegian People's Party.\n\nBy August 2003, the headquarters of the Democrats in Kristiansand had reportedly been vandalised eight times. In its first elections, the 2003 local elections, the Democrats ran in 46 municipalities and boroughs, and won 0.3% of the nationwide vote in the county elections. It won two representatives in the Kristiansand municipal council, and one in the Vest-Agder county council. In 2005, the Democrats became represented in the Bergen city council owing to the defection of a Progress Party councillor.\n\nThe party stepped up its activity with the aim of gaining a foothold in the Norwegian Parliament at the 2005 parliamentary election. Before the election, party leader Vidar Kleppe tried to bolster support for the party by calling for the closure of all Mosques in Norway if they did not clearly distance themselves from terrorism. Candidates running for the party also had to withstand threats and attacks during the electoral campaign. This included Nordland county leader Amund Garfors receiving death threats, and party leader Vidar Kleppe being physically assaulted both by a former Workers' Communist Party deputy leader, and by members of a demonstration by left-wing organisations SOS Rasisme, the Blitz-movement and Socialist Youth. Despite running a high-profile campaign, the Democrats failed to make any breakthrough in the election.\n\nThe Democrats increased their number of candidates for the 2007 local elections, and ran in 85 municipalities and boroughs, as well as in all 19 counties. The party won 0.3% of the overall vote in the county elections, and kept its representation in the Vest-Agder county council. It gained eight municipal councillors, among them in the cities Trondheim and Kristiansand. For the 2009 parliamentary election the Democrats for the first time ran in all the counties in Norway. The Democrats complained about the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation to the OSCE, as the party along with other extraparliamentary parties that ran in all 19 counties had been denied television coverage (except the Red Party). Only a few weeks before the 2009 election, the headquarters of the Democrats were broken into, and a computer containing material planned for use in the election campaign was stolen. In the election, the party remained at 0.1% of the vote.\n\nThe Democrats had to renew its public registration owing to the poor 2009 election result, and chose to re-register itself as the \"Democrats in Norway\". The party only ran in 31 municipalities for the 2011 local elections. It nevertheless again won eight municipal councillors, this time in five councils (two councillors in three councils), and held its representation in the Vest-Agder county council. Besides its two representatives in Kristiansand (in Vest-Agder), all of the party's municipal councillors were elected in Hordaland. After the election, the party became part of local cooperations that would govern Kristiansand and Stord.\n\nVidar Kleppe stepped down as leader in 2012 and was succeeded by Kjell Arne Sellæg. The change in leadership was followed by internal strife and resignations. Eleven weeks after his appointment as leader, Sellæg left the Democrats to form a new party, the Moderates. He was succeeded by Elisabeth Rue Strencbo. In 2013 the party elected Fredrik U. Litleskare as new leader of the party. Litleskare withdrew from the position in 2014 citing internal non-political conflicts, and was succeeded by Ellen Simonsen as acting leader. In 2015 Terje Svendsen was elected new leader. In 2016 Kim Steinar Kjærner-Strømberg was elected new leader, until he with the member of the board was exposed for a political coup according to the Norwegian Party Regulation Tribunal (PLN). He was succeeded by Makvan Kasheikal, an immigrant from Iran The election of Makvan Kasheikal is regarded as not valid by the PLN (The Norwegian Party Regulation tribunal).\n\nThe main issues for the party are law and order, increased help for the elderly and disabled, and a restrictive immigration and asylum policy. The principles of the Democrats are built on Christian values, and Norwegian culture and tradition. The party opposes mass immigration and increased Islamic influence, fearing that Western liberal values such as human rights and the Christian heritage will be endangered. It also seeks drastic measures against crime. When questioned about the party's place on the political spectrum, former Democrats' leader Vidar Kleppe responded that the Democrats are \"in many ways a centrist party.\" As of 2015, the party officially describes itself as a \"national value-conservative\" party. The Democrats consider the Danish People's Party and the Sweden Democrats to be its sister parties. The party has been characterised by media and scholars as a radical-right populist party.\n\nThe Democrats identify the causes of the recent upsurge in serious crime in Norway to be a result of low penalties, liberal immigration policies, and a lack of funding for the police, courts and prison system. The party wants to raise the sentence frame of first-degree murder to life imprisonment, and otherwise raise minimum sentence frames. It does not support giving penalty discounts for multiple offences, and wants instead to add up penalties for every single offence. The party wants to double sentences for second-time offenders, triple sentences for third-time offenders and so on.\n\nOne of the main issues for the Democrats is immigration to Norway, and the party wants a strongly restrictive immigration policy. The party maintains that mass-immigration to western countries leads to considerable problems that are hard to solve, including considerable costs for social security payments and great increases in crime. The party believes that Norway's liberal values will be put in danger if a \"Muslim mass immigration\" is accepted. The party wants a stricter policy towards criminal immigrants, for instance allowing for the repatriation of immigrants participating in organized and gang-crime.\n\nThe party also claims that the current Norwegian refugee-policy is cynical in that it seeks to help the few refugees who can afford the journey to Norway, when there are millions of people suffering worldwide without such possibilities. The Democrats seeks to change the refugee-policy to instead helping people outside the Norwegian border. They claim that in that way the Norwegian state can afford to help much more refugees for the same amount of money that it requires to help considerably fewer people in Norway.\n\nThe Democrats are opposed to Norwegian membership in the European Union, and wants Norway to withdraw from the European Economic Area and the Schengen Agreement. The party wants to replace membership of the EEA with a free trade agreement.\n\nWhile supporting continued membership of NATO and the United Nations, it contends that the latter must reform. The party supports increased free trade, and wants to dissolve state-controlled foreign aid. The party only supports foreign aid to countries pursuing free-market policies, but maintains support to countries in cases of natural disasters, war and famine. Supportive of Israel, the party proposes to move the Norwegian embassy to what it describes as \"the country's capital, Jerusalem.\"\n\nAs of the 2011 local elections (0.3% county results), the party is represented in one county, Vest-Agder (1), and five municipalities; Kristiansand (2), Askøy (2), Odda (2), Fedje (1) and Stord (1)\n\nThe Democrats have been endorsed by several notable figures in Norway. One of the co-founders of the party was former coach of the football club IK Start, Karsten Johannessen, who has since been a repeated low-key candidate for the party.\nIn the 2005 parliamentary election, the Democrats were endorsed by former boxer Ole Klemetsen and former pop singer Gry Jannicke Jarlum, who both stood as low-key candidates. Professional Elvis impersonator Kjell Elvis has long endorsed Vidar Kleppe, and subsequently the Democrats, and stood as a low-key candidate for it in 2011. Country artist Åsmund Åmli stood as a low-key candidate for the party in both the 2007 and 2011 local elections.\n\n\n"}

As a result, the poles have a higher surface gravity, and thus higher temperature and brightness. Thus, the poles are \"gravity brightened\", and the equator \"gravity darkened\".\n\nThe star becomes oblate (and hence gravity darkening occurs) because the centrifugal force resulting from rotation creates additional outward pressure on the star. The centrifugal force is expressed mathematically as\n\nwhere formula_2 is mass (in this case of a small volume element of the star), formula_3 is the angular velocity, and formula_4 is the radial distance from the axis of rotation. In the case of a star, the value of formula_4 is largest at the equator and smallest at the poles. This means that equatorial regions of a star will have a greater centrifugal force when compared to the pole. The centrifugal force pushes mass away from the axis of rotation, and results in less overall pressure on the gas in the equatorial regions of the star. This will cause the gas in this region to become less dense, and cooler.\n\nVon Zeipel's theorem states that the radiation from a star is proportional to the local effective gravity, that is to the gravity reduced by any centrifugal force at that location on the star's surface. Then the effective temperature is proportional to the fourth root of the effective gravity.\n"}
{"id": "1977868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1977868", "title": "Slavery in medieval Europe", "text": "Slavery in medieval Europe\n\nSlavery became increasingly uncommon through the Middle Ages and was largely replaced by serfdom by the 10th century, but began to revive again towards the end of the Middle Ages and in the Early Modern Era. The Byzantine–Ottoman wars (1265–1479) and the Ottoman wars in Europe (14th to 20th centuries) resulted in the capture of large numbers of Christian slaves. The Dutch, French, Spanish, Portuguese, British, Arabs and a number of West African kingdoms played a prominent role in the Atlantic slave trade, especially after 1600.\n\nIn the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, slaves became quite rare by the first half of the 7th century. A shift in the view of slavery is noticed, which by the 10th century transformed gradually a slave-object into a slave-subject. From 11th century, semi-feudal relations largely replaced slavery, seen as \"an evil contrary to nature, created by man's selfishness\", although slavery was permitted by the law.\n\nThe majority of Western European languages, including English, use variations of the word \"slave\" which is an eponym of Slavs who were held in bondage in the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe chaos following the barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire made the taking of slaves habitual throughout Europe in the early Middle Ages. Roman practices continued in many areas the Welsh laws of Hywel the Good included provisions dealing with slaves and Germanic laws provided for the enslavement of criminals, as when the Visigothic Code prescribed enslavement for those who could not pay the financial penalty for their crime and as a punishment for certain other crimes. Such criminals would become slaves to their victims, often with their property.\n\nAs these peoples Christianized, the church worked more actively to reduce the practice of holding coreligionists in bondage. St. Patrick, who himself was captured and enslaved at one time, protested an attack that enslaved newly baptized Christians in his . The restoration of order and the growing power of the church slowly transmuted the late Roman slave system of Diocletian into serfdom.\n\nAnother major factor was the rise of Bathilde, queen of the Franks, who had been enslaved before marrying Clovis II. When she became regent, her government outlawed slave-trading of Christians throughout the Merovingian empire. \nAbout 10% of England's population entered in the Domesday Book (1086) were slaves, despite chattel slavery of English Christians being nominally discontinued after the 1066 conquest. It is difficult to be certain about slave numbers, however, since the old Roman word for slave (\"servus\") continued to be applied to people with a status that was later to be called \"serf\".\n\nDemand from the Islamic world dominated the slave trade in medieval Europe. For most of that time, however, sale of Christian slaves to non-Christians was banned. In the \"pactum Lotharii\" of 840 between Venice and the Carolingian Empire, Venice promised not to buy Christian slaves in the Empire, and not to sell Christian slaves to Muslims. The Church prohibited the export of Christian slaves to non-Christian lands, for example in the Council of Koblenz in 922, the Council of London in 1102, and the Council of Armagh in 1171. \n\nAs a result, most Christian slave merchants focused on moving slaves from non-Christian areas to Muslim Spain, North Africa, and the Middle East, and most non-Christian merchants, although not bound by the Church's rules, focused on Muslim markets as well. Arabic silver dirhams, presumably exchanged for slaves, are plentiful in eastern Europe and Southern Sweden, indicating trade routes from Slavic to Muslim territory.\n\nBy the reign of Pope Zachary (741–752), Venice had established a thriving slave trade, buying in Italy, amongst other places, and selling to the Moors in Northern Africa (Zacharias himself reportedly forbade such traffic out of Rome). When the sale of Christians to Muslims was banned (\"pactum Lotharii\"), the Venetians began to sell Slavs and other Eastern European non-Christian slaves in greater numbers. Caravans of slaves traveled from Eastern Europe, through Alpine passes in Austria, to reach Venice. A record of tolls paid in Raffelstetten (903–906), near St. Florian on the Danube, describes such merchants. Some are Slavic themselves, from Bohemia and the Kievan Rus'. They had come from Kiev through Przemyśl, Kraków, Prague, and Bohemia. The same record values female slaves at a \"tremissa\" (about 1.5 grams of gold or roughly of a dinar) and male slaves, who were more numerous, at a \"saiga\" (which is much less). Eunuchs were especially valuable, and \"castration houses\" arose in Venice, as well as other prominent slave markets, to meet this demand.\n\nVenice was far from the only slave trading hub in Italy. Southern Italy boasted slaves from distant regions, including Greece, Bulgaria, Armenia, and Slavic regions. During the 9th and 10th centuries, Amalfi was a major exporter of slaves to North Africa. Genoa, along with Venice, dominated the trade in the Eastern Mediterranean beginning in the 12th century, and in the Black Sea beginning in the 13th century. They sold both Baltic and Slavic slaves, as well as Armenians, Circassians, Georgians, Turks and other ethnic groups of the Black Sea and Caucasus, to the Muslim nations of the Middle East. Genoa primarily managed the slave trade from Crimea to Mamluk Egypt, until the 13th century, when increasing Venetian control over the Eastern Mediterranean allowed Venice to dominate that market. Between 1414 and 1423 alone, at least 10,000 slaves were sold in Venice.\n\nRecords of long-distance Jewish slave merchants date at least as far back as 492, when Pope Gelasius permitted Jews to import non-Christian slaves into Italy, at the request of a Jewish friend from Telesina.\nBy the turn of the 6th to the 7th century, Jews had become the chief slave traders in Italy, and were active in Gallic territories.\nPope Gregory the Great issued a ban on Jews possessing Christian slaves, lest the slaves convert to Judaism. By the 9th and 10th centuries, Jewish merchants, sometimes called Radhanites, were a major force in the slave trade continent-wide.\n\nJews were one of the few groups who could move and trade between the Christian and Islamic worlds.\nIbn Khordadbeh observed and recorded routes of Jewish merchants in his Book of Roads and Kingdoms from the South of France to Spain, carrying (amongst other things) female slaves, eunuch slaves, and young slave boys. He also notes Jews purchasing Slavic slaves in Prague. Letters of Agobard, archbishop of Lyons (816–840), acts of the emperor Louis the Pious, and the seventy-fifth canon of the Council of Meaux of 845 confirms the existence of a route used by Jewish traders with Slavic slaves through the Alps to Lyon, to Southern France, to Spain.\nToll records from Walenstadt in 842–843 indicate another trade route, through Switzerland, the Septimer and Splügen passes, to Venice, and from there to North Africa.\n\nAs German rulers of Saxon dynasties took over the enslavement (and slave trade) of Slavs in the 10th century, Jewish merchants bought slaves at the Elbe, sending caravans into the valley of the Rhine. Many of these slaves were taken to Verdun, which had close trade relations with Spain. Many would be castrated and sold as eunuchs as well.\n\nThe Jewish population of Crimea was a very important factor in the trade in slaves and captives of the Crimean Khanate (Tatars) in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries.\n\nJews would later become highly influential in the European slave trade, reaching their apex from the 16th to 19th centuries.\n\nA ready market, especially for men of fighting age, could be found in Umayyad Spain, with its need for supplies of new mamelukes.\n\nAl-Hakam was the first monarch of this family who surrounded his throne with a certain splendour and magnificence. He increased the number of mamelukes (slave soldiers) until they amounted to 5,000 horse and 1,000 foot. ... he increased the number of his slaves, eunuchs and servants; had a bodyguard of cavalry always stationed at the gate of his palace and surrounded his person with a guard of mamelukes ... these mamelukes were called Al-l;Iaras (the Guard) owing to their all being Christians or foreigners. They occupied two large barracks, with stables for their horses.\n\nAccording to Roger Collins although the role of the Vikings in the slave trade in Iberia remains largely hypothetical, their depredations are clearly recorded. Raids on AlAndalus by Vikings are reported in the years 844, 859, 966 and 971, conforming to the general pattern of such activity concentrating in the mid ninth and late tenth centuries. Muslim Spain imported an enormous number of slaves, as well as serving as a staging point for Muslim and Jewish merchants to market slaves to the rest of the Islamic world.\nDuring the reign of Abd-ar-Rahman III (912–961), there were at first 3,750, then 6,087, and finally 13,750 Saqaliba, or Slavic slaves, at Córdoba, capital of the Umayyad Caliphate.\nIbn Hawqal, Ibrahim al-Qarawi, and Bishop Liutprand of Cremona note that the Jewish merchants of Verdun specialized in castrating slaves, to be sold as eunuch saqaliba, which were enormously popular in Muslim Spain.\n\nDuring the Viking age (793 – approximately 1100), the Norse raiders often captured and enslaved militarily weaker peoples they encountered. \nThe Nordic countries called their slaves \"thralls\" (Old Norse: \"Þræll\"). \nThe thralls were mostly from Western Europe, among them many Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and Celts. \nMany Irish slaves travelled in expeditions for the colonization of Iceland. \nRaids on monasteries provided a source of young, educated slaves who could be sold in Venice or Byzantium for high prices.\nScandinavian trade centers stretched eastwards from Hedeby in Denmark and Birka in Sweden to Staraya Ladoga in northern Russia before the end of the 8th century.\n\nThis traffic continued into the 9th century as Scandinavians founded more trade centers at Kaupang in southwestern Norway and Novgorod, farther south than Staraya Ladoga, and Kiev, farther south still and closer to Byzantium. Dublin and other northwestern European Viking settlements were established as gateways through which captives were traded northwards.\nIn the Laxdæla saga, for example, a Rus merchant attends a fair in the Brenn Isles in Sweden selling female slaves from northwestern Europe.\n\nThe Norse also took German, Baltic, Slavic and Latin slaves. \nThe 10th-century Persian traveller Ibn Rustah described how Swedish Vikings, the Varangians or Rus, terrorized and enslaved the Slavs taken in their raids along the Volga River.\nSlaves were often sold south, to Byzantine or Muslim buyers, via paths such as the Volga trade route.\nAhmad ibn Fadlan of Baghdad provides an account of the other end of this trade route, namely of Volga Vikings selling Slavic Slaves to middle-eastern merchants.\nFinland proved another source for Viking slave raids.\nSlaves from Finland or Baltic states were traded as far as central Asia.\n\nThe Mongol invasions and conquests in the 13th century added a new force in the slave trade. The Mongols enslaved skilled individuals, women and children and marched them to Karakorum or Sarai, whence they were sold throughout Eurasia. Many of these slaves were shipped to the slave market in Novgorod.\n\nGenoese and Venetians merchants in Crimea were involved in the slave trade with the Golden Horde. In 1441, Haci I Giray declared independence from the Golden Horde and established the Crimean Khanate. For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. In a process called the \"harvesting of the steppe\", they enslaved many Slavic peasants.\n\nAs a commonly traded commodity in the British Isles, like cattle, slaves could become a form of internal or trans-border currency.\nWilliam the Conqueror banned the exporting of slaves from England, limiting the nation's participation in the slave trade.\n\nAlthough the primary flow of slaves was toward Muslim countries, Christians did acquire Muslim slaves; in Southern France, in the 13th century, \"the enslavement of Muslim captives was still fairly common\".\nThere are records, for example, of Saracen slave girls sold in Marseilles in 1248, a date which coincided with the fall of Seville and its surrounding area, to raiding Christian crusaders, an event during which a large number of Muslim women from this area, were enslaved as war booty, as it has been recorded in some Arabic poetry, notably by the poet al-Rundi, who was contemporary to the events.\n\nChristians also sold Muslim slaves captured in war. \nThe Order of the Knights of Malta attacked pirates and Muslim shipping, and their base became a center for slave trading, selling captured North Africans and Turks. \nMalta remained a slave market until well into the late 18th century. \nOne thousand slaves were required to man the galleys (ships) of the Order.\n\nAs more and more of Europe Christianized, and open hostilities between Christian and Muslim nations intensified, large-scale slave trade moved to more distant sources.\nSending slaves to Egypt, for example, was forbidden by the papacy in 1317, 1323, 1329,\n1338, and, finally, 1425, as slaves sent to Egypt would often become soldiers, and end up fighting their former Christian owners.\nAlthough the repeated bans indicate that such trade still occurred, they also indicate that it became less desirable.\nIn the 16th century, African slaves replaced almost all other ethnicities and religious enslaved groups in Europe.\n\nSlavery was heavily regulated in Roman law, which was reorganized in the Byzantine Empire by Justinian I as the Corpus Iuris Civilis. Although the Corpus was lost to the West for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 11th and 12th centuries, and led to the foundation of law schools in Italy and France. According to the Corpus, the natural state of humanity is freedom, but the \"law of nations\" may supersede natural law and reduce certain people to slavery. The basic definition of slave in Romano-Byzantine law was:\n\n\nIt was, however, possible to become a freedman or a full citizen; the Corpus, like Roman law, had extensive and complicated rules for manumission of slaves.\n\nThe slave trade in England was officially abolished in 1102.\n\nIn Poland slavery was forbidden in the 15th century; it was replaced by the second enserfment. In Lithuania, slavery was formally abolished in 1588.\n\nIn fact, there was an explicit legal justification given for the enslavement of Muslims, found in the Decretum Gratiani and later expanded upon by the 14th century jurist Oldradus de Ponte: the Bible states that Hagar, the slave girl of Abraham, was beaten and cast out by Abraham's wife Sarah. \nThe Decretum, like the Corpus, defined a slave as anyone whose mother was a slave. Otherwise, the canons were concerned with slavery only in ecclesiastical contexts: slaves were not permitted to marry or to be ordained as clergy.\n\nAs a result of the crusades, thousands of Muslims and Christians were sold into slavery. Once sold into slavery most were never heard from again, so it is challenging to find evidence of specific slave experiences.\n\nIn the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, founded in 1099, at most 120,000 Franks ruled over 350,000 Muslims, Jews, and native Eastern Christians. Following the initial invasion and conquest, sometimes accompanied by massacres or expulsions of Jews and Muslims, a peaceable co-existence between followers of the three religions prevailed. The Crusader states inherited many slaves. To this may have been added some Muslims taken as captives of war. The Kingdom's largest city, Acre, had a large slave market; however, the vast majority of Muslims and Jews remained free. The laws of Jerusalem declared that former Muslim slaves, if genuine converts to Christianity, must be freed. \n\nIn 1120, the Council of Nablus forbade sexual relations between crusaders and their female Muslim slaves: if a man raped his own slave, he would be castrated, but if he raped someone else's slave, he would be castrated and exiled from the kingdom. But Benjamin Z. Kedar argued that the canons of the Council of Nablus were in force in the 12th century but had fallen out of use by the thirteenth. Marwan Nader questions this and suggests that the canons may not have applied to the whole kingdom at all times.\n\nChristian law mandated Christians could not enslave other Christians; however, enslaving non-Christians was acceptable. In fact, military orders frequently enslaved Muslims and utilized slave labor for agricultural estates. No Christian, whether Western or Eastern, was permitted by law to be sold into slavery, but this fate was as common for Muslim prisoners of war as it was for Christian prisoners taken by the Muslims. In the later medieval period, some slaves were used to oar Hospitaller ships. Generally, it was a relatively small number non-Christian slaves in medieval Europe, and this number significantly decreased by the end of the medieval period.\n\nThe 13th-century Assizes of Jerusalem dealt more with fugitive slaves and the punishments ascribed to them, the prohibition of slaves testifying in court, and manumission of slaves, which could be accomplished, for example, through a will, or by conversion to Christianity. Conversion was apparently used as an excuse to escape slavery by Muslims who would then continue to practise Islam; crusader lords often refused to allow them to convert, and Pope Gregory IX, contrary to both the laws of Jerusalem and the canon laws that he himself was partially responsible for compiling, allowed for Muslim slaves to remain enslaved even if they had converted.\n\nAn early economic pillar of the Islamic empire in Iberia (Al-Andalus) during the eighth century was the slave trade. Forming relations between the Umayyads, Khārijites and ‘Abbāsids, the flow of trafficked people from the main routes of the Sahara towards Al-Andalus served as a highly lucrative trade configuration. The archaeological evidence of human trafficking and proliferation of early trade in this case follows numismatics and materiality of text. This monetary structure of consistent gold influx proved to be a tenet in the development of Islamic commerce. In this regard, the slave trade outperformed and was the most commercially successful venture for maximizing capital. This major change in the form of numismatics serves as a paradigm shift from the previous Visigothic economic arrangement. Additionally, it demonstrates profound change from one regional entity to another, the direct transfer of people and pure coinage from one religiously similar semi-autonomous province to another. \n\nThe medieval Iberian Peninsula was the scene of episodic warfare among Muslims and Christians (although sometimes Muslims and Christians were allies). Periodic raiding expeditions were sent from Al-Andalus to ravage the Christian Iberian kingdoms, bringing back booty and people. For example, in a raid on Lisbon in 1189 the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur took 3,000 female and child captives, and his governor of Córdoba took 3,000 Christian slaves in a subsequent attack upon Silves in 1191; an offensive by Alfonso VIII of Castile in 1182 brought him over two-thousand Muslim slaves.\n\nContrary to suppositions of historians such as Marc Bloch, slavery thrived as an institution in medieval Christian Iberia. Slavery existed in the region under the Romans, and continued to do so under the Visigoths. From the fifth to the early 8th century, large portions of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Christian Visigothic Kingdoms, whose rulers worked to codify human bondage. In the 7th century, King Chindasuinth issued the Visigothic Code (Liber Iudiciorum), to which subsequent Visigothic kings added new legislation. Although the Visigothic Kingdom collapsed in the early 8th century, portions of the Visigothic Code were still observed in parts of Spain in the following centuries. The Code, with its pronounced and frequent attention to the legal status of slaves, reveals the continuation of slavery as an institution in post-Roman Spain.\n\nThe Code regulated the social conditions, behavior, and punishments of slaves in early medieval Spain. The marriage of slaves and free or freed people was prohibited. Book III, title II, iii (\"Where a Freeborn Woman Marries the Slave of Another or a Freeborn Man the Female Slave of Another\") stipulates that if a free woman marries another person's slave, the couple is to be separated and given 100 lashes. Furthermore, if the woman refuses to leave the slave, then she becomes the property of the slave's master. Likewise, any children born to the couple would follow the father's condition and be slaves.\n\nUnlike Roman law, in which only slaves were liable to corporal punishment, under Visigothic law, people of any social status were subject to corporal punishment. However, the physical punishment, typically beatings, administered to slaves was consistently harsher than that administered to freed or free people. Slaves could also be compelled to give testimony under torture. For example, slaves could be tortured to reveal the adultery of their masters, and it was illegal to free a slave for fear of what he or she might reveal under torture. Slaves' greater liability to physical punishment and judicial torture suggests their inferior social status in the eyes of Visigothic lawmakers.\n\nSlavery remained persistent in Christian Iberia after the Umayyad invasions in the 8th century, and the Visigothic law codes continued to control slave ownership. However, as William Phillips notes, medieval Iberia should not be thought of as a slave society, but rather as a society that owned slaves. Slaves accounted for a relatively small percentage of the population, and did not make up a significant portion of the labor pool. Furthermore, while the existence of slavery continued from the earlier period, the use of slaves in post-Visigothic Christian Iberia differed from early periods. Ian Wood has suggests that, under the Visigoths, the majority of the slave population lived and worked on rural estates.\n\nAfter the Muslim invasions, slave owners (especially in the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia) moved away from using slaves as field laborers or in work gangs, and did not press slaves into military service. Slaves tended to be owned singly rather than in large groups. There appear to have been many more female than male slaves, and they were most often used as domestic servants, or to supplement free labor. In this respect, slave institutions in Aragon, especially, closely resembled those of other Mediterranean Christian kingdoms in France and Italy.\n\nIn the kingdoms of León and Castile, slavery followed the Visigothic model more closely than in the littoral kingdoms. Slaves in León and Castile were more likely to be employed as field laborers, supplanting free labor to support an aristocratic estate society. These trends in slave populations and use changed in the wake of the Black Death in 1348, which significantly increased the demand for slaves across the whole of the peninsula.\n\nChristians were not the only slaveholders in Christian Iberia. Both Jews and Muslims living under Christian rule owned slaves, though more commonly in Aragon and Valencia than in Castile. After the conquest of Valencia in 1245, the Kingdom of Aragon prohibited the possession of Christian slaves by Jews, though they were still permitted to hold Muslim or pagan slaves. The main role of Iberian Jews in the slave trade came as facilitators: Jews acted as slave brokers and agents of transfer between the Christian and Muslim kingdoms.\n\nThis role caused some degree of fear among Christian populations. A letter from Pope Gregory XI to the Bishop of Cordoba in 1239 addressed rumors that the Jews were involved in kidnapping and selling Christian women and children into slavery while their husbands were away fighting the Muslims. Despite these worries, the primary role of Jewish slave traders lay in facilitating the exchange of captives between Muslim and Christian rulers, one of the primary threads of economic and political connectivity between Christian and Muslim Iberia.\n\nIn the early period after the fall of the Visigothic kingdom in the 8th century, slaves primarily came into Christian Iberia through trade with the Muslim kingdoms of the south. Most were Eastern European, captured in battles and raids, with the heavy majority being Slavs. However, the ethnic composition of slaves in Christian Iberia shifted over the course of the Middle Ages. Slaveholders in the Christian kingdoms gradually moved away from owning Christians, in accordance with Church proscriptions. In the middle of the medieval period most slaves in Christian Iberia were Muslim, either captured in battle with the Islamic states from the southern part of the peninsula, or taken from the eastern Mediterranean and imported into Iberia by merchants from cities such as Genoa.\n\nThe Christian kingdoms of Iberia frequently traded their Muslim captives back across the border for payments of money or kind. Indeed, historian James Broadman writes that this type of redemption offered the best chance for captives and slaves to regain their freedom. The sale of Muslim captives, either back to the Islamic southern states or to third-party slave brokers, supplied one of the means by which Aragon and Castile financed the Reconquista. Battles and sieges provided large numbers of captives; after the siege of Almeria in 1147, sources report that Alfonso VII of León sent almost 10,000 of the city's Muslim women and children to Genoa to be sold into slavery as partial repayment of Genoese assistance in the campaign.\n\nTowards the end of the Reconquista, however, this source of slaves became increasingly exhausted. Muslim rulers were increasingly unable to pay ransoms, and the Christian capture of large centers of population in the south made wholesale enslavement of Muslim populations impractical. The loss of an Iberian Muslim source of slaves further encouraged Christians to look to other sources of manpower. Beginning with the first Portuguese slave raid in sub-Saharan Africa in 1411, the focus of slave importation began to shift from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic World, and the racial composition of slaves in Christian Iberia began to include an increasing number of black Africans.\n\nBetween 1489 and 1497 almost 2,100 black slaves were shipped from Portugal to Valencia. By the end of the 15th century, Spain held the largest population of black Africans in Europe, with a small, but growing community of black ex-slaves. In the mid 16th century Spain imported up to 2,000 black African slaves annually through Portugal, and by 1565 most of Seville's 6,327 slaves (out of a total population of 85,538) were black Africans.\n\nSlavery () existed on the territory of present-day Romania from before the founding of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in the 13th–14th centuries, until it was abolished in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of Roma (Gypsy) ethnicity. Particularly in Moldavia there were also slaves of Tatar ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the Nogai and Crimean Tatars.\n\nThe exact origins of slavery in the Danubian Principalities are not known. There is some debate over whether the Romani people came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or as slaves. In the Byzantine Empire, they were slaves of the state and it seems the situation was the same in Bulgaria and Serbia until their social organization was destroyed by the Ottoman conquest, which would suggest that they came as slaves who had a change of 'ownership'.\n\nHistorian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era, the Romanians taking the Roma from the Mongols as slaves and preserving their status. Other historians consider that they were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the \"Tatar slaves\" is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the Golden Horde, Cumans, or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans.\n\nWhile it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, the bulk of them came from south of the Danube at the end of the 14th century, some time after the foundation of Wallachia. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and possibly in both principalities, but the arrival of the Roma made slavery a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.\n\nThe ancient and medieval Near East includes modern day Turkey, the Levant and Egypt, with strong connections to the rest of the north African coastline. All of these areas were ruled by either the Byzantines or the Persians at the beginning of late antiquity. Pre-existing Byzantine (i.e. Roman) and Persian institutions of slavery may have influenced the development of institutions of slavery in Islamic law and jurisprudence.\n\nWhatever the relationship between these different legal traditions, many similarities exist between the practice of Islamic slavery in the early Middle Ages and the practices of early medieval Byzantines and western Europeans. The status of freed slaves under Islamic rule, who continued to owe services to their former masters, bears a strong similarity to ancient Roman and Greek institutions. However, the practice of slavery in the early medieval Near East also grew out of slavery practices in currency among pre-Islamic Arabs.\n\nLike the Old and New Testaments and Greek and Roman law codes, the Quran takes the institution of slavery for granted, though it urges kindness toward slaves and eventual manumission, especially for slaves who convert to Islam. \nIn early Middle Ages, many slaves in Islamic society served as such for only a short period of time—perhaps an average of seven years. Like their European counterparts, early medieval Islamic slave traders preferred slaves who were not co-religionists and hence focused on \"pagans\" from inner Asia, Europe, and especially from sub-Saharan Africa. The practice of manumission may have contributed to the integration of former slaves into the wider society. However, under sharia law, conversion to Islam did not necessitate manumission.\nSlaves were employed in heavy labor as well as in domestic contexts. Because of Quranic sanction of concubinage, early Islamic traders, in contrast to Byzantine and early modern slave traders, imported large numbers of female slaves. The very earliest Islamic states did not create corps of slave soldiers (a practice familiar from later contexts) but did integrate freedmen into armies, which may have contributed to the rapid expansion of early Islamic conquest. By the 9th century, use of slaves in Islamic armies, particularly Turks in cavalry units and Africans in infantry units, was a relatively common practice. \n\nIn Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun imported thousands of black slaves to wrestle independence from the Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq in 868. The Ikhshidid dynasty used black slave units to liberate itself from Abbasid rule after the Abbasids destroyed ibn Tulun's autonomous empire in 935. Black professional soldiers were most associated with the Fatimid dynasty, which incorporated more professional black soldiers than the previous two dynasties. It was the Fatimids who first incorporated black professional slave soldiers into the cavalry, despite massive opposition from Central Asian Turkish Mamluks, who saw the African contingent as a threat to their role as the leading military unit in the Egyptian army.\n\nIn the later half of the Middle Ages, the expansion of Islamic rule further into the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, and Arabian Peninsula established the Saharan-Indian Ocean slave trade. \nThis network was a large market for African slaves, transporting approximately four million African slaves from its 7th century inception to its 20th century demise. \n\nPatterns of preference for slaves in the Near East, as well as patterns of use, continued into the later Middle Ages with only slight changes. Slaves were employed in many activities, including agriculture, industry, the military, and domestic labor. Women were prioritized over men, and usually served in the domestic sphere as menials, concubines, or wives.\nDomestic and commercial slaves were mostly better off than their agricultural counterparts, either becoming family members or business partners rather than condemned to a grueling life in a chain gang. There are references to gangs of slaves, mostly African, put to work in drainage projects in Iraq, salt and gold mines in the Sahara, and sugar and cotton plantations in North Africa and Spain. References to this latter type of slavery are rare, however. Eunuchs were the most prized and sought-after type of slave.\n\nThe most fortunate slaves found employment in politics or the military. In the Ottoman Empire, the Devşrime system groomed young slave boys for civil or military service. Young Christian boys were uprooted from their conquered villages periodically as a levy, and were employed in government, entertainment, or the army, depending on their talents. Slaves attained great success from this program, some winning the post of Grand Vizier to the Sultan and others positions in the Janissaries.\n\nIt is a bit of a misnomer to classify these men as \"slaves\", because in the Ottoman Empire, they were referred to as kul, or, slaves \"of the Gate\", or Sultanate. While not slaves per se under Islamic law, these Devşrime alumni remained under the Sultan's discretion.\n\nThe Islamic Near East extensively relied upon professional slave soldiers, and was known for having them compose the core of armies. The institution was conceived out of political predicaments and reflected the attitudes of the time, and was not indicative of political decline or financial bankruptcy. Slave units were desired because of their unadulterated loyalty to the ruler, since they were imported and therefore could not threaten the throne with local loyalties or alliances.\n\nSlavery was a wide-spread phenomenon across the Mediterranean. Slavery in the Mediterranean is often seen as less horrendous and more transitory than Atlantic slave trade to the Americas; however, slavery in the Mediterranean shared many inhumane characteristics with Atlantic slave trade and greatly impacted the Mediterranean region.However there were some differences. Slaves in America were transported to an entirely new setting without the opportunity to contact their families left behind or the opportunity to gain their freedom.The total number of slaves in the Mediterranean has been debated among scholars, but the number of slaves in the Mediterranean was significantly smaller than the 11-12 million people brought to the Americas. One scholar estimated three million slaves were taken between 1500 and 1800. Of those slaves, Christians outnumbered Muslims by two-to-one. These numbers are based off of archival sources which outlined how many slaves were freed and captured in battles. One of the challenges of accurately counting the number of slaves in the Mediterranean is the wide variety of regions slaves were taken from and brought to. Additionally, the number of slaves in the Mediterranean was constantly changing, most significantly in periods of warfare.\n\nIn the Mediterranean, individuals became enslaved through war and conquest, piracy, and frontier raiding. Additionally, some courts would sentence people to slavery, and even some people sold themselves or their children into slavery due to extreme poverty.The incentive for slavery in the Mediterranean was economic. In fact, the motivation behind many raids was the capturing of people to then enslave and sell or demand ransom for. State and religious institutions frequently participated in the ransoming of individuals, so piracy became a lucrative market. Additionally, this meant some individuals where returned home while others were sold away.\n\nThere were markets throughout the Mediterranean where enslaved people were bought and sold. In Italy the major slave trade centers were Venice and Genoa; in Iberia they were Barcelona and Valencia; and islands off the Mediterranean including Majorca, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Rhodes, Cyprus, and Chios also participated in slave markets. From these markets merchants would sell enslaved people domestically, or transport them to somewhere enslaved people were more in demand.\n\nThe duties and expectations of slaves varied geographically; however, in the Mediterranean, it was most common for enslaved people to work in the households of elites. Enslaved people also worked in agricultural fields, but this was infrequent across the Mediterranean. It was most common in Venetian Crete, Genoese Chios, and Cyrpus where enslaved people worked in vineyards, fields, and sugar mills. These were colonial societies, and enslaved people worked with free laborers in these areas. Enslaved women were sought after the most and therefore sold at the highest prices. This reflects the desire for domestic workers in elite households; however, enslaved women also could face sexual exploitation.\n\nSlavery was an important part of Ottoman society. The Byzantine-Ottoman wars and the Ottoman wars in Europe brought large numbers of Christian slaves into the Ottoman Empire. In the middle of the 14th century, Murad I built his own personal slave army called the \"Kapıkulu\". The new force was based on the sultan's right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include captives taken in battle. The captive slaves were converted to Islam and trained in the sultan's personal service. \n\nIn the \"devşirme\" (translated \"blood tax\" or \"child collection\"), young Christian boys from Anatolia and the Balkans were taken away from their homes and families, converted to Islam and enlisted into special soldier classes of the Ottoman army. These soldier classes were named Janissaries, the most famous branch of the \"Kapıkulu\". The Janissaries eventually became a decisive factor in the Ottoman military conquests in Europe. \n\nMost of the military commanders of the Ottoman forces, imperial administrators and \"de facto\" rulers of the Ottoman Empire, such as Pargalı İbrahim Pasha and Sokollu Mehmet Paşa, were recruited in this way. By 1609 the Sultan's \"Kapıkulu\" forces increased to about 100,000.\n\nThe concubines of the Ottoman Sultan consisted chiefly of purchased slaves. Because Islamic law forbade Muslims to enslave fellow Muslims, the Sultan's concubines were generally of Christian origin. The mother of a Sultan, though technically a slave, received the extremely powerful title of \"Valide Sultan\", and at times became effective ruler of the Empire (see Sultanate of women). One notable example was Kösem Sultan, daughter of a Greek Christian priest, who dominated the Ottoman Empire during the early decades of the 17th century. Another notable example was Roxelana, the favourite wife of Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\nSlavery in Poland existed on the territory of Kingdom of Poland during the times of the Piast dynasty, however slavery was restricted to POWs. In some special cases and for limited periods serfdom was also applied to debtors. \nSlavery was banned officially in 1529 and prohibition on slavery was one of the most important of the Statutes of Lithuania, which had to be implemented before the Grand Duchy of Lithuania could join the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. The First Statute was drafted in 1522 and came into power in 1529 by the initiative of the Lithuanian Council of Lords. It has been proposed that the codification was initiated by Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Mikołaj Radziwiłł as a reworking and expansion of the 15th century Casimir's Code.\n\nIn Kievan Rus and Russia, the slaves were usually classified as kholops. A kholop's master had unlimited power over his life: he could kill him, sell him, or use him as payment upon a debt. The master, however, was responsible before the law for his kholop's actions. A person could become a kholop as a result of capture, selling himself or herself, being sold for debts or committed crimes, or marriage to a kholop. Until the late 10th century, the kholops represented a majority among the servants who worked lordly lands.\n\nBy the 16th century, slavery in Russia consisted mostly of those who sold themselves into slavery owing to poverty. They worked predominantly as household servants, among the richest families, and indeed generally produced less than they consumed. Laws forbade the freeing of slaves in times of famine, to avoid feeding them, and slaves generally remained with the family a long time; the \"Domostroy\", an advice book, speaks of the need to choose slaves of good character and to provide for them properly. Slavery remained a major institution in Russia until 1723, when Peter the Great converted the household slaves into house serfs. Russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679.\n\nIn 1382 the Golden Horde under Khan Tokhtamysh sacked Moscow, burning the city and carrying off thousands of inhabitants as slaves. For years the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan routinely made raids on Russian principalities for\nslaves and to plunder towns. Russian chronicles record about 40 raids of Kazan Khans on the Russian territories in the first half of the 16th century. In 1521, the combined forces of Crimean Khan Mehmed I Giray and his Kazan allies attacked Moscow and captured thousands of slaves. About 30 major Tatar raids were recorded into Muscovite territories between 1558 and 1596. In 1571, the Crimean Tatars attacked and sacked Moscow, burning everything but the Kremlin and taking thousands of captives as slaves. In Crimea, about 75% of the population consisted of slaves.\n\nThe laws from 12th and 13th centuries describe the legal status of two categories. According to the Norwegian Gulating code (in about 1160), domestic slaves could not, unlike foreign slaves, be sold out of the country. This and other laws defined slaves as their master's property at the same level as cattle. It also described a procedure for giving a slave their freedom. A freed slave did not have full legal status; for example, the punishment for killing a former slave was low. A former slave's son also had a low status, but higher than that of his parents. The Norwegian law code from 1274, \"Landslov\" (Land's law), does not mention slaves, but former slaves. Thus it seems like slavery was abolished in Norway by this time. In Sweden, slavery was abolished in 1343.\n\nBritish Wales and Gaelic Ireland and Scotland were among the last areas of Christian Europe to give up their institution of slavery. Under Gaelic custom, prisoners of war were routinely taken as slaves. During the period that slavery was disappearing across most of western Europe, it was reaching its height in the British Isles: the Viking invasions and the subsequent warring between Scandinavians and the natives, the number of captives taken as slaves drastically increased. The Irish church was vehemently opposed to slavery and blamed the 1169 Norman invasion on divine punishment for the practice, along with local acceptance of polygyny and divorce.\n\nIn considering how serfdom evolved from slavery, historians who study the divide between slavery and serfdom encounter several issues of historiography and methodology. Some historians believe that slavery transitioned into serfdom (a view that has only been around for the last 200 years), though there is disagreement among them regarding how rapid this transition was. Pierre Bonnassie, a medieval historian, thought that the chattel slavery of the ancient world ceased to exist in the Europe of the 10th century and was followed by feudal serfdom. Jean-Pierre Devroey thinks that the shift from slavery to serfdom was gradual as well in some parts of the continent. Other areas, though, did not have what he calls \"western-style serfdom\" after the end of slavery, such as the rural areas of the Byzantine Empire, Iceland, and Scandinavia. Complicating this issue is that regions in Europe often had both serfs and slaves simultaneously. In northwestern Europe, a transition from slavery to serfdom happened by the 12th century. The Catholic Church promoted the transformation by giving the example. Enslavement of fellow Catholics was prohibited in 992 and manumission was declared to be a pious act. However it remained legal to enslave people of other religions and dogmas.\n\nGenerally speaking, regarding how slaves differed from serfs, the underpinnings of slavery and serfdom are debated as well. Dominique Barthélemy, among others, has questioned the very premises for neatly distinguishing serfdom from slavery, arguing that a binary classification masks the many shades of servitude. Of particular interest to historians is the role of serfdom and slavery within the state, and the implications that held for both serf and slave. Some think that slavery was the exclusion of people from the public sphere and its institutions, whereas serfdom was a complex form of dependency that usually lacked a codified basis in the legal system. Wendy Davies argues that serfs, like slaves, also became excluded from the public judicial system and that judicial matters were attended to in the private courts of their respective lords.\n\nDespite the scholarly disagreement, it is possible to piece together a general picture of slavery and serfdom. Slaves typically owned no property, and were in fact the property of their masters. Slaves worked full-time for their masters and operated under a negative incentive structure; in other words, failure to work resulted in physical punishment. Serfs held plots of land, which was essentially a form of \"payment\" that the lord offered in exchange for the serf's service. Serfs worked part-time for the masters and part-time for themselves and had opportunities to accumulate personal wealth that often did not exist for the slave.\n\nSlaves were generally imported from foreign countries or continents, brought to Europe via the slave trade. Serfs were typically indigenous Europeans and were not subject to the same involuntary movements as slaves. Serfs worked in family units, whereas the concept of family was generally murkier for slaves. At any given moment, a slave's family could be torn apart via trade, and masters often used this threat to coerce compliant behavior from the slave.\n\nThe end of serfdom is also debated, with Georges Duby pointing to the early 12th century as a rough end point for \"serfdom in the strict sense of the term\". Other historians dispute this assertion, citing discussions and the mention of serfdom as an institution during later dates (such as in 13th century England, or in Central Europe, where the rise of serfdom coincided with its decline in Western Europe). There are several approaches to get a time span for the transition, and lexicography is one such method. There is supposedly a clear shift in diction when referencing those who were either slaves or serfs at approximately 1000, though there is not a consensus on how significant this shift is, or if it even exists.\n\nIn addition, numismatists shed light on the decline of serfdom. There is a widespread theory that the introduction of currency hastened the decline of serfdom because it was preferable to pay for labor rather than depend on feudal obligations. Some historians argue that landlords began selling serfs their land – and hence, their freedom – during periods of economic inflation across Europe. Other historians argue that the end of slavery came from the royalty, who gave serfs freedom through edicts and legislation in an attempt to broaden their tax base.\n\nThe absence of serfdom in some parts of medieval Europe raises several questions. Devroey thinks it is because slavery was not born out of economic structures in these areas, but was rather a societal practice. Heinrich Fichtenau points out that in Central Europe, there was not a labor market strong enough for slavery to become a necessity.\n\nIn late Rome, the official attitude toward slavery was ambivalent. According to Justinian's legal code, slavery was defined as \"an institution according to the law of nations whereby one person falls under the property rights of another, contrary to nature\".\n\nJustifications for slavery throughout the medieval period were dominated by the perception of religious difference. Slaves were often outsiders taken in war. As such, Hebrew and Islamic thinking both conceived of the slave as an \"enemy within\". In the Christian tradition, pagans and heretics were similarly considered enemies of the faith who could be justly enslaved. In theory, slaves who converted could embark on the path to freedom, but practices were inconsistent: masters were not obliged to manumit them and the practice of baptising slaves was often discouraged. The enslavement of co-religionists was discouraged, if not forbidden, for Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike. Consequently, northern European pagans and black Africans were a target for all three religious groups. Ethnic and religious difference were conflated in the justification of slavery.\n\nA major Christian justification for the use of slavery, especially against those with dark skin, was the Curse of Ham. The Curse of Ham refers to a biblical parable (Gen. 9:20–27) in which Ham, the son of Noah, sins by seeing his father inebriated and naked, although scholars differ on the exact nature of Ham's transgression. Noah then curses Ham's offspring, Canaan, with being a \"servant of servants unto his brethren\". Although race or skin color is not mentioned, many Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars began to interpret the passage as a curse of both slavery and black skin, in an attempt to justify the enslavement of people of color, specifically those of African descent. In the medieval period, however, it was also used by some Christians as a justification for serfdom. Muslim sources in the 7th century allude to the Curse of Ham gaining relevance as a justifying myth for the Islamic world's longstanding enslavement of Africans.\n\nThe apparent discrepancy between the notion of human liberty founded in natural law and the recognition of slavery by canon law was resolved by a legal \"compromise\": enslavement was allowable given a just cause, which could then be defined by papal authority. The state of slavery was thought to be closely tied to original sin. Towards the middle of the 15th century, the Catholic Church, in particular the Papacy, took an active role in offering justifications for the enslavement of Saracens, pagans, infidels, and \"other enemies of Christ\". In 1452, a papal bull entitled Dum Diversas authorized King Afonso V of Portugal to enslave any \"Saracens\" or \"pagans\" he encountered. The Pope, Pope Nicholas V, recognized King Alfonso's military action as legitimate in the form of the papal bull, and declared the\n\nfull and free power, through the Apostolic authority by this edict, to invade, conquer, fight, and subjugate the Saracens and pagans, and other infidels and other enemies of Christ, and ... to reduce their persons into perpetual servitude ...\n\nIn a follow-up bull, released in 1455 and entitled Romanus Pontifex, Pope Nicholas V reiterated his support for the enslavement of infidels in the context of Portugal's monopoly on North African trade routes.\n\nHistorians such as Timothy Rayborn have contended that religious justifications served to mask the economic necessities underlying the institution of slavery.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Peabody Awards Board of Jurors, serving from 1945 to 1968. He won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 1959.\n\nMcGill was born February 5, 1898, near Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee. He attended school at The McCallie School in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After high school, he attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, but did not graduate because he was suspended his senior year for writing an article in the student newspaper critical of the school's administration. McGill served in the Marine Corps during World War I.\n\nAfter the war, McGill got a job working for the sports department of the \"Nashville Banner\" and soon worked his way up to sports editor. In 1929, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia to become the assistant sports editor of \"The Atlanta Constitution\". Wanting to move from sports to more serious news, he got an assignment to cover the first Cuban Revolt in 1933. He also applied for and was granted a Rosenwald Fellowship in 1938, which allowed him to cover the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938. These articles earned him a spot as executive editor of the \"Constitution\", which he used to highlight the effects of segregation. In response, many angry readers sent threats and letters to McGill. Some acted on the threats and burned crosses at night on his front lawn, fired bullets into the windows of his home and left crude bombs in his mailbox.\n\nIn the late 1950s, McGill became a syndicated columnist, reaching a national audience. In 1960, McGill was the only editor of a major white southern paper to cover the passive resistance tactics used by the students involved in the Greensboro sit-ins, although eventually other papers followed his lead. He became friends with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, acting as a civil rights advisor and behind the scenes envoy to several African nations.\n\nIn addition to the Pulitzer Prize, McGill received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from dozens of universities and colleges, including Harvard, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. In 1963 he published his book \"The South and the Southerner\" as well as several anthologies of his newspaper articles. McGill died of a heart attack two days before his 71st birthday. After his death Ralph McGill Boulevard (previously Forrest Boulevard) and Ralph McGill Middle School were named for him in Atlanta. In his honor, The McGill Lecture is held annually at The Grady School of Journalism at the University of Georgia, featuring a nationally recognized journalist.\n\nHis personal papers were donated to Emory University and are available at the Manuscripts and Rare Book Library (MARBL) at Emory University Library. Ralph McGill is mentioned by name in Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" as one of the \"few enlightened white persons\" to understand and sympathize with the civil rights movement at the time of the letter (April 1963). McGill's role in the campaign against segregation is depicted in Michael Braz's opera, \"A Scholar Under Siege\", composed for the centenary of Georgia Southern University and premiered in 2007. A National Public Broadcasting Prime Time Special, \"Dawn's Early Light: Ralph McGill and the Segregated South\" (1988), documented his impact. Burt Lancaster voiced McGill and prominent figures appear such as Julian Bond, Tom Brokaw, Jimmy Carter, John Lewis, Vernon Jordan, Herman Talmadge, Sander Vanocur, Andrew Young, and Pulitzer Prize winning journalists Harry Ashmore, Eugene Patterson and Claude Sitton.\n\n\n"}

It runs between Ogilvie Transportation Center and Kenosha, Wisconsin. Although Metra owns the rolling stock, the trains are operated and dispatched by the Union Pacific Railroad. This line was previously operated by the Chicago & North Western Railway before its merger with Union Pacific, and was called the Chicago and North Western Milwaukee Division and then the Chicago & North Western/North Line before the C&NW was absorbed by Union Pacific in April, 1995.\n\nMetra does not refer to its lines by particular colors, but the timetable accents for the Union Pacific/North line are dark \"Flambeau Green,\" a nod to the C&NW's \"Flambeau 400\" passenger train.)\n\nThe current timetable has 35 weekday trains leaving Chicago, 17 of which terminate at Waukegan, 9 at Kenosha, 3 at Highland Park, 5 at Winnetka, 1 at North Chicago.\n\nThe route followed by the UP/North Line was constructed in 1854 by the Chicago & Milwaukee Railroad. Passenger service between Chicago and Waukegan began on January 4, 1855. Initially, a single train operated each day, departing from a terminal in Chicago at Water St. and Kinzie St. at 8:30 am and returning from Waukegan at 3:30 pm. The president of the railroad, former Chicago mayor Walter S. Gurnee, speculated on land in Lake County spurring the development of railway suburbs along the line. The railroad merged with the Green Bay, Milwaukee & Chicago Railroad in 1863, and was acquired by the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1866. Commuter rail services along the line started operating into the new Chicago and North Western Terminal (now Ogilvie Transportation Center) in 1911. In 1966, the Chicago and North Western closed the Lake Front Depot and began operating into the new Milwaukee Union Station. This service would ultimately prove to be relatively short lived as the Chicago and North Western ended operations between Chicago and Milwaukee in 1971 and the line was truncated to Kenosha. \n\nThe North line became part of Metra when the agency was formed in 1984. The trains continued to be operated by the Chicago and North Western Railway under contract until that railroad was bought by Union Pacific in 1995. UP now operates passenger services along the line for Metra. Under a longstanding agreement that UP inherited from the C&NW, Metra owns the vehicles and the stations along the line, but Union Pacific employs the people who actually drive the trains, and they also control the right-of-way along the route.\n\nAll stations on the line except for Ravinia Park are open daily. Ravinia Park is only open during the Ravinia Festival in the summer months.\n\nIn 2010, Metra began a project to replace 22 bridges between Clybourn and Rogers Park, which are at the end of their design lives and in need of replacement. Metra's initial plan called for significantly reduced service for the duration of the project. Widespread frustration with this service pattern led to the project being delayed to investigate potential ways to keep existing service. Many people were angry that the original plan for the project would have centered the tracks in the existing right-of-way, preventing any possibility of rebuilding a third track without rebuilding the entire right-of-way or purchasing additional land. Metra claimed that in order to maintain existing service levels during construction, $100 million in additional funding would be needed. This funding was eventually procured and in 2011, Metra began work on a modified plan that will allow pre-existing service levels to be maintained as the bridges are replaced.\n\nThere have been ongoing plans to extend the line, possibly as far as Milwaukee for many years. Wisconsin's now defunct Southeastern Regional Transit Authority (SERTA) had completed several studies of the project, but was disbanded in 2011. An Application for funding under the FTA's New Starts program was submitted in 2010, and the agency received federal money for preliminary engineering and construction. In 2011, however, a new Wisconsin budget passed which disbanded SERTA. $15 million in federal funding was returned. The project has since received little attention and is generally considered \"Dead.\"\n\nIn late 2015, the Racine City Council unanimously approved a study to extend the line from its current terminus at Kenosha to Racine.\n\nAfter the passage of the Rebuild Illinois, $15 million was allocated by the State of Illinois for construction of a new Peterson Ridge station located in Chicago's Edgewater neighborhood. Construction is expected to start in 2020.\n\nSince 2014 annual ridership has declined from 9.3 million to 8.6 million, an overall decline of 6.8%.\n\nThe Union Pacific / North Line operates push-pull service with bi-level gallery car coaches and cab cars from Budd, Morrison-Knudsen/Amerail, and Nippon Sharyo. The locomotive fleet consists of EMD F40PHs.\n\nCar 553 is a club car operating exclusively on the UP/North Line. It is not actually owned by the railroad, but by a private club of commuters. UP allows the operation at no charge, apart from collecting ticket fares from the club members, who are in charge of maintaining the railcar. Club membership was once limited to wealthy male commuters from affluent North Shore towns such as Lake Forest, Lake Bluff and Highland Park, but is now open to any commuter on the line for a $900 annual membership fee. It is the last privately owned railcar in American commuter service.\n\nThe southern terminus of the UP/North Line is at the Ogilvie Transportation Center in downtown Chicago. The route traverses Chicago's northern neighborhoods and its northern and far northern suburbs to Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nThe Green Bay Trail parallels the Union Pacific / North Line, using the former right of way of the North Shore Line for over from Chicago Loop to Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\n\n"}

During this time he made numerous appearances as a guest on national radio and television programs, and testified before congress concerning humans rights issues. During his tenure, Amnesty International was seen to become increasingly interventionist in its policies, advocating that states take a more active role in secure human rights protections, encouraging collaboration with law enforcement and even military force.\n\nHis own writings during his tenure emphasized the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an embodiment of the international conception of human rights. During his acceptance speech for the Humanist of the Year from the American Humanist Association in 2000, he said \"The fact is that the world community has never been able to agree upon the divine basis for human rights or a basis derived from natural law. But there is a third broad way to justify human rights which, while it doesn't provide them with the status of God's endorsement or nature's sanction, does ground them in the human community. That third way goes by many names—pragmatism, communitarianism, and post-modernism among others—but is ultimately nothing more than an expression of the humanist impulse.\"\nAlso during his tenure, the increasing economic ties with China led to scrutiny and debate about China's policies regarding human rights. During his testimony to the United States House, he criticized the increased use of the death penalty as well as the use of imprisonment and torture against democratic activists and ethnic and religious minorities. In particular in arguing against continued MFN status with China, he said \"the message is clear, good trade relations in the midst of human rights violations is acceptable to the United States.\"\n\nThe events of the September 11 attacks, and the subsequent expansion of the United States counter-terrorism efforts were the subject of his 2003 book \"Tainted Legacy: 9/11 and the Ruin of Human Rights\" which finds him criticizing both the government's use of torture, which he credits with inspiring terrorists, as well as some of his human rights activist colleagues for failing to frame terrorism and genocide as a human rights issues.\nSchulz served as the president and chief executive officer for the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee from 2010 until this retirement 2016.\n\nSchulz has been the author of numerous books throughout his career and during his retirement, as well as a frequent contributor to periodicals.\n\nSchulz served on the boards of numerous organizations including People for the American Way, Planned Parenthood, Communitarian Network, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

The chiefdom was centered around the northern end of Old Tampa Bay, the arm of Tampa Bay that extends between the present-day city of Tampa and northern Pinellas County. The exact location of the principal town is believed to be the archeological Safety Harbor Site, which gives its name to the Safety Harbor culture, of which the Tocobaga are the most well-known group.\n\nThe name \"Tocobaga\" is often applied to all of the native peoples of the immediate Tampa Bay area during the first Spanish colonial period (1513-1763). While they were culturally very similar, most of the villages on the eastern and southern shores of Tampa Bay were likely affiliated with other chiefdoms, such as the Pohoy, Uzita, and Mocoso. Study of archaeological artifacts has provided insight into the everyday life of the Safety Harbor culture. However, little is known about the political organization of the early peoples of the Tampa Bay area. The scant historical records come exclusively from the journals and other documents made by members of several Spanish expeditions that traversed the area in the 1500s.\n\nThe Tocobaga and their neighbors disappeared from the historical record by the early 1700s, as diseases brought by European explorers decimated the local population and survivors were displaced by the raids and incursions of other indigenous groups from the north. The Tampa Bay area was virtually uninhabited for over a century.\n\nThe Tampa Bay area was visited by Spanish explorers during the Spanish Florida period in Florida. In 1528, Pánfilo de Narváez likely landed in Tampa Bay, and may have passed through the territory of the Tocobaga chiefdom on his journey north. The Hernando de Soto Expedition likely landed on the south side of Tampa Bay in 1539, and passed through the eastern part of Safety Harbor territory after occupying the village of Uzita. Garcilaso de la Vega (known as \"el Inca\"), in his history of de Soto's expedition, relates that Narváez had ordered that the nose of the chief of Uzita be cut off, indicating that the two explorers had passed through the same area. Another town near Uzita encountered by de Soto was Mocoso, but evidence suggests that, while Mocoso was in the Safety Harbor culture area together with Uzita and Tocobaga, the Mocoso people spoke a different language, possibly Timucua.\n\nThe entirely missionary expedition of Father Luis de Cancer visited Tampa Bay natives in 1549 in an attempt to convert the locals peacefully and repair the damage done in previous years by conquistadors. Despite being cautioned to avoid the dangerous Gulf Coast, the expedition landed south of Bahia Espiritu Santo \"(a.k.a. Tampa Bay)\" in May 1549. There they encountered apparently peaceful and receptive Natives who told them of the many populous villages around Tampa Bay, and de Cancer decided to go north. Upon reaching the Bay area, members of the expedition were killed or captured, and de Cancer was clubbed to death soon after reaching shore.\n\nHernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a shipwreck survivor who lived with the Natives of southern Florida from 1549–1566 and was rescued from the Calusa by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, described Tocobaga, Abalachi (Apalachee) and Mogoso (Mocoço) as \"separate kingdoms\" from the Calusa. Ucita and Mocoço at the time of de Soto's visit were subject to a chief named Urriparacoxi or Paracoxi (also given as Urribarracuxi). De Soto marched to the town of Paracoxi, which appears to have been inland from Tampa Bay, where he found maize under cultivation. (By contrast, the Safety Harbor people made little or no use of maize.)\n\nThe name \"Tocobaga\" first appears in Spanish documents in 1567, when Pedro Menéndez de Avilés visited what was almost certainly the Safety Harbor site. Menéndez had contacted the Calusa and reached an accommodation with Carlos, the Calusa king, including a marriage with Carlos' sister. As Carlos was anxious to gain an advantage over his enemy Tocobaga, Menéndez took Carlos and 20 of his warriors to Tocobaga by ship. Menéndez persuaded Tocobaga and Carlos to make peace. He recovered several Europeans and a dozen Calusa being held as slaves by Tocobaga. Menéndez left a garrison of 30 men at Tocobaga to encourage the people of the town to convert to Christianity; he returned Carlos and the other Calusa to their town. In January 1568 boats taking supplies to the garrison at Tocobaga found the town deserted, and all of the Spanish soldiers dead.\n\nIn 1608 an alliance of Pohoy and Tocobaga may have threatened Potano people who had been converted to Christianity. In 1611 a raiding party from the two chiefdoms killed several Christianized Natives carrying supplies to the Spanish mission (Cofa) at the mouth of the Suwannee River. In 1612, the Spanish launched a punitive expedition down the Suwannee River and along the Gulf coast, attacking Tocobaga and Pohoy, killing many of their people, including both chiefs. The Tocobaga were weakened by the Spanish attack, and the Pohoy became the dominant power in Tampa Bay for a while.\n\nIn 1677 a Spanish official inspecting the missions in Apalachee Province visited a village of Tocobaga people living on the Wacissa River one league from the mission of San Lorenzo de Ivitachuco. There is no record of when the Tocobaga settled on the Wacissa River, but they appear to have been there for a while. When the Spanish official criticized the Tocobaga for having lived in a Christian province \"for many years\" without having converted, they replied that no one had come to teach them about Christianity, but that some twenty of their people had converted on their death beds and been buried at the mission in Ivitachuco. The Tocobaga were engaged in transporting produce from Apalachee Province to St. Augustine, carrying it in canoes along the coast and up the Suwannee River and, probably, the Santa Fe River. Other people carried it overland the rest of the way to St. Augustine. The village was listed again in 1683, but it is not clear what happened when Apalachee Province was overrun by the English and their Native allies in 1704. When the Spanish returned to San Marcos de Apalachee in 1718, they found a few Tocobaga living along the Wacissa River. The Spanish commander persuaded the Tocobaga to move to the mouth of the St. Marks River under the protection of a battery. In August that year 25 to 30 Pohoy attacked the Tocobaga settlement, killing eight and taking three away as captives. A small number of Tocobaga continued to live in the vicinity of San Marcos through the 1720s and 1730s.\n\nThe population of Tocobaga declined severely in the 17th century, due mostly to the spread of infectious diseases brought by the Europeans, to which the native people had little resistance, as they had no acquired immunity. In addition, all of the Florida tribes lost population due to the raids by the Creek and Yamasee around the end of the 17th century. Remnants of the Calusa, who lived to the south of the Tocobaga, were forced into extreme southern Florida. As Florida transitioned to British rule in 1763 following its defeat of France in the Seven Years' War, the Calusa emigrated with Spanish refugees and resettled with them in Cuba, possibly along with the remnants of the Tocobaga. In any case, the Tocobaga disappeared from historical records in the early 18th century.\n\n\n"}

Today the PMTS is mainly used in work measurement for shorter cycles in labour oriented industries such as apparel and footwear. This topic comes under wider industrial and production engineering.\n\nOne of such a system is known as \"Work Factor\" and more popular Methods-time measurement, (MTM) released in 1948 exist today in several variations and used in some commercial applications. \n\nNew legislation in developed markets following sustainability issues, Living Wage movement and the 2013 disaster in Rana Plaza, Bangladesh have brought labor costing and standards back to the focus of activists and global fashion retailers. Occupational safety and health (OSH, OHS), Ergonomics, Skills development and job satisfaction are some of the other factors influenced by Labor Standards Act (Japan).\n\nPredetermined Motion Time Standard and Predetermined Time standards (PTS), Pre-determined Time Systems are other terms that describe same concept by different authors. Main outcome of PMTS application is quantifying labor inputs in terms of SMV (Standard Minute Value) or SAM (Stranded Allocated Minute).\n\nMost predetermined motion time systems (MTM and MOST) use time measurement units (TMU) instead of seconds for measuring time. One TMU is defined to be 0.00001 hours, or 0.036 seconds. These smaller units allow for more accurate calculations without the use of decimals. In the most in-depth PMT systems, motions observed will be on the level of individual TMUs, like toss (3 TMUs in MiniMOST) and simple pick-up (2 TMUs in MTM-1). More general systems simplify things by grouping individual elements, and thus have larger time values – for example, a bend and arise (61 TMUs in MTM-2) and one or two steps (30 TMUs in BasicMOST). Systems with even less detail work with TMU values in the hundreds, like climbing 10 rungs on a ladder (300 TMUs in MaxiMOST) or passing through a door (100 TMUs in MaxiMOST).\n\nThe choice of which variation of a certain PMTS to use is dependent on the need for accuracy in contrast to the need for quick analysis, as well as the length of the operation, the distances involved in the operation, and the repetitiveness of the operation. Longer operations often take place on a larger spatial scale, and tend to be less repetitive, so these issues are often treated as one. For longer, less repetitive operations, statistical analysis demonstrates that the accuracy of less detailed systems will generally approach the accuracy of more detailed systems. Thus, in order to reduce the time required for analysis, less detailed systems (like MTM-B and MaxiMOST) are usually used when possible. Conversely, very short, repetitive processes are commonly analyzed with more exact methods like MTM-1 and MiniMOST because of the need for accuracy.\n\nManchester University researchers including Doug Miller, has gone deep into uses of PMTS in apparel labour costing in \"Towards Sustainable Labour Costing in UK Fashion Retail.\" Doug says ..work measurement for arriving at a standard time should normally make provision for relaxation, contingency and special allowances. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), as of 1992 there were some 200 different PTS systems.\n\nClosely related manufacturing improvement methodologies:\n\nModern Concepts and related Terminology: \n\n"}

It is generally regarded as the most severe pitched battle that took place in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. The battle of Hilli took place between 23 November 1971 and 11 December 1971, although the final surrender took place on 18 December 1971.\n\nThe main objective of the Indian Army was to control Bogura, thereby cutting off Pakistan forces in the north from the rest of East Pakistan. The best way of getting to Bogura was through Hilli. The frontal assault on the Pakistan fortifications took a huge toll on both sides before Indian forces finally broke through by establishing a block in the rear of Pakistani forces in Hilli, upon which the 4FF Battalion in Hilli withdrew for the defence of Bogura.\n\nThe Indian side consisted of the 20 Indian Mountain Division led by Maj-Gen. Lachhman Singh. The constituent units of this division were 66 Brigade, 165 Brigade, 202 Brigade and 340 Brigade (all infantry units), 3 Armoured Brigade, 471 Engineer Brigade and two artillery brigades augmented by 33 Corps Artillery. The ground troops were aided by aerial support provided by the Indian Air Force which had acquired air superiority in the east and were armed with rockets, guns, and 100 lb bombs.\n\nOn the Pakistan side, the Area of Responsibility (AOR) was on 205 Brigade of Pakistan Army led by Brigadier (later retired as General) Tajammul Hussain Malik. He had joined the brigade four days ago, when he volunteered to leave GHQ, Rawalpindi and command troops in the East Pakistan. He put up a stiff resistance that earned praise from many quarters.\n\nTajammal Hussain Malik had placed screens along the railway line nearby and at the Railway Station complex in the area. The defensive positions were sited in depth to cover all routes leading into East Pakistan. They fought the entire Indian division and the Mukti Bahini soldiers until the Indians decided to bypass Hilli and establish a block in its rear. Brigadier Tajammal Hussain Malik then withdrew the forces in Hilli to avoid being cut off and to defend from the Bogura itself.\n\nBogura was surrounded from all sides by the greater numbers of the Indian army and the Mukti Bahini. Brigadier Tajammal Hussain Malik's resistance continued even after the Pakistani Eastern Command surrendered in Dhaka on 16 December. He, in his staff car with flags and stars uncovered, went around the streets of Bogura motivating his soldiers to keep fighting. The Indian army had by then, surrounded the city of Bogura. The Brigade Major along with some 50 ORs surrendered, but Tajammal Hussain Malik, still full of vigour, refused to give up.\n\nBrig. Tajammal Hussain Malik ordered the rest of his brigade to break out in small groups to Naogong, where one of his units was still fighting on. However en route, his jeep was ambushed, severely injuring him and his orderly. Muktis captured both of them and subjected them to torture. They broke his arms and split his head after which he was taken semi-conscious to an Indian army hospital. Major General Nazar Hussain Shah, was specially flown in from Natore for the surrender of this brigade on 18 December 1971, due to the refusal of Brigadier Tajammal Hussain Malik to surrender. Upon return from captivity, he was the only brigadier out of 32 or so who fought the 1971 War in East Pakistan to have been promoted to the rank of major general.\n\nThe battle was a significant one as it involved great personal valour on both sides. This is highlighted by the fact that soldiers on either side won their nation's highest military honours. One of the infantry battalions of the 20 Indian Mountain Division 5/11 Gorkha Rifles distinguished itself here and later earned the battle honour Bogura for itself, the commanding officer of the Indian battalion, then Lt Col F T Dias later rose to the rank of Lieutenant General in the Indian Army. In fact other than the battalion commander one of the company commanders, then Maj J B S Yadava become Lieutenant General and Maj Abjeet Mamik rose to become a Brigadier and Capt B K Bopanna later become Lieutenant General in the Indian Armed Forces, which is a unique honour to the soldiers of an army.\n\nThis battle was also unique in that it had started before the official start of the India Pakistan war but continued right until the formal surrender of Pakistan.\n\nBangladesh\n\nIndia\n\nPakistan\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of three main tributaries of the River Ogmore which runs through the town of Bridgend. It is in Wales, United Kingdom.\n\nOriginating in Blaengarw, it passes through the villages of Pontycymer, Pantygog, Lluest/Braichycymer, Tylagwyn, Llangeinor, Abergarw and finally the village of Brynmenyn, where it joins the River Ogmore.\n\nWith most of the River Garw's course running along the floor of the river valley to which its name is given, it collects a number of tributary streams along the way. These streams are listed in order of confluence with the river from its uppermost point to its confluence with the River Ogmore.\n\n\nThe effects of coal mining in the valley, both from small family owned shafts and major pits alike, caused the river to become polluted and dirty with coal dust and other chemicals to the point at which it was once entirely black in colour, earning it the mainly local nickname of the \"Black River\".\n\nThe River Garw once contained Salmon amongst other fish. Industrialisation of the valley resulted in their loss, but they are slowly being re-introduced as part of the valley's regeneration, after the closure of the coal mines in the 1980s and the recovery of the now useful shale through a brief period of restorative opencast mining in the 1990s.\n\nIt also runs through Bryngarw Country Park - a managed and publicly owned estate and nature reserve, where many types of birds can occasionally be seen.\n\nDuring periods of prolonged heavy rain, the River Garw quite commonly bursts its shallow banks, causing minor flooding in all villages along its length. As the villages are mostly up on the valley sides, this doesn't have any significant effect, save for a few places; a house that once stood next to what is now a small footbridge across the river near the children's playground on the valley floor at Pantygog was demolished some years ago due to constant flooding from the river. The river has also been known to flood the playground area at Braichycymmer, and sometimes becomes hazardous near the Llangeinor playing fields/railway crossing, and in the lower regions of Bryngarw Country Park (where it has become less of a problem due to the deepening off the river bed to these ends). Its tributary streams, one of which joins at the boundary of Pontycymer and Pantygog, can turn from mere babbling brooks to raging torrents in a matter of a few minutes, and it is not unknown for this to occur very suddenly.\n\n\n"}

When such characters are young, there is often not much explanation as to how they acquired so many skills at an early age.\n\nExamples of early modern competent heroes include the protagonists of George Bernard Shaw, like Henry Higgins in \"Pygmalion\" and Caesar in \"Caesar and Cleopatra\", as well as the citizen soldiers in Rudyard Kipling's \"The Army of a Dream\".\nMany non-superpowered comic book characters are written as hyper-competent characters due to the perception that they would simply be considered underpowered otherwise. Batman, for example, is typically depicted as a member of the Justice League of America alongside Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern, all of whom are superpowered while he lacks superhuman powers of any kind. As a result, despite his original depiction as a vigilante, modern depictions of Batman portray him as having achieved the peak-human possibility in things physical and intellectual.

While Metra does not refer to its lines by particular colors, the BNSF line's color on Metra timetables is \"Cascade Green,\" a nod to the paint of the Burlington Northern Railroad. In July 2017, the public timetable (published October 9, 2016) showed 47 trains leaving Chicago each weekday, of which 31 run to Aurora. Of the 16 trains that do not reach Aurora, 5 terminate at Route 59, 1 at Naperville, 1 at Downers Grove-Main Street, 5 at Downers Grove-Fairview Avenue, 3 at Westmont, and 1 at Brookfield. The public timetable (published October 9, 2016) also showed 47 trains arriving in Chicago each weekday, of which 29 start in Aurora.

The CB&Q operated the commuter service until the railroad merged into the Burlington Northern in 1970. Burlington Northern merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1995 to form the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad. It later changed its name to the abbreviation, BNSF.\n\nWhen the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) began subsidizing Chicago's commuter rail operations in 1974, Burlington Northern continued to operate its line under contract to the RTA.

{"id": "1978042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978042", "title": "Slavery in the British and French Caribbean", "text": "Slavery in the British and French Caribbean\n\nSlavery in the British and French Caribbean refers to slavery in the parts of the Caribbean dominated by France or the British Empire.\n\nIn the Caribbean, England colonised the islands of St. Kitts and Barbados in 1623 and 1627 respectively, and later, Jamaica in 1655. These and other Caribbean colonies later became the center of wealth and the focus of the slave trade for the growing British Empire.\nAs of 1778, the French were importing approximately 13,000 Africans for enslavement to the French West Indies each year.\n\nIn France the slaving interest was based in Nantes, La Rochelle, Bordeaux, and Le Havre during the years 1763 to 1792. The men involved defended their business against the abolition movement of 1789. The 'negreos' were merchants who specialized in funding and directing cargoes of black captives to the Caribbean colonies, which had high death rates and needed a continuous fresh supply. The négriers intermarried with each other's families; most were Protestants. Their derogatory and patronizing approach toward blacks immunized them from moral criticism. They strongly opposed to the application of the Declaration of Rights of Man to blacks. While they ridiculed the slaves as dirty and savage, they often took a black mistress. The French government paid a bounty on each captive sold to the colonies, which made the business profitable and patriotic.\n\nThis section is entirely based on Jacqueline Couti's book \"Dangerous Creole Liaisons, Sexuality and Nationalism in French Caribbean Discourses from 1806 to 1897.\"\n\nCreole women were an essential part of the history of the slavery period in the French Caribbean and especially on Martinique Island as well as in France.\n\nCreole women always have been a source of exoticism and adventure for people in the mainland, in the French imaginary, their sensuality represented this exoticism related to Martinique and French Caribbean islands in general as they looked different and were believed to have different sexual practices as white French women at the time (due to their African and Native origins). As Creole women were slaves, the masters would turn to them to fulfill their sexual desires and leave behind white French women. The ideal woman at the time was a white pure mother explaining the reason why so many slave owners turned to Creole women, hence abandoning their duties as fathers according to the French beliefs and traditions. Authors like Traversay argue that the fault is in fact on Creole women as they are the one supposedly luring men into failing white, respectable, French women.\nWith the end of the 18th century comes a troubled time for France in general. As the monarchy is collapsing, the new government aims to change the image of France as an equal and right country with the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the first document allowing every man basic rights and paving the way for future human rights’ declarations. With this new era of human rights, the government still intends to keep a refined and traditionalist image of the country. During the revolution, white women were the representation of this newly acquired liberty with the examples of Liberty Leading the People and Marianne. A problem, therefore, occurred when both liberty and the image of women were problematic in the French Caribbean, slavery and Creole women were simply not a good representation of free, pure and motherly France according to the ones in charge. Authors (like Levilloux and Maynard) now glorify this new image of France, appealing to the new democratic public, considering the new world and more importantly the French Caribbean and Creole women as a representation of the colonialist past of the French monarchy : lavish, sensual, erotic and exotic, values that can no longer be considered acceptable by the new regime. Interracial marriages and relations were therefore forbidden as they tried to change the image of the country, as much as the French Caribbean was considered morally lost, they still had to take control and avoid métis children and freed slaves to take over the islands. \nThe different revolutions were also traumatic for the Creole people, as they supported the return of monarchy with the Bourbon dynasty since the 1814 \"Restauration\", the July Revolution was felt like a final blast on them.\n\nAround this time came the modern idea of racism with the skin color at the center of questioning. Black skin was then considered unpure and almost disease-like in order to differentiate the ‘true’ colons and French citizens from Natives and former slaves and Creole people. The hierarchy of race began in this late 18th century period with whiteness at the top of the scheme.\n\nIn this scenario, black women are at the origin of white men's lust and are considered once again, the source of the loss of the white culture in the Caribbean. Creole women and their bodies, in particular, are seen as representing the ‘abject mix’ (Dangerous Créole Liaisons, 67) between African bodies and white bodies. But the masters, unwilling to change their habits, find new excuses to explain their behavior. Incest, therefore, became the black sheep. By scaring people into believing all Creole and Africans could be related, white Europeans on the island made sure that mixing of races was still a better option than incest. Creole women were stuck in this ‘in between’ where whatever they did, they would be seen as erotic temptresses (if they slept with white people, they were driving good men away from potential good wives or their own wives and France would resent them but if they didn't, they would be accused of incest and perverted practices and local white men would resent them).\n\nThe Lesser Antilles islands of Barbados, St. Kitts, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Antigua, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia and Dominica were the first important slave societies of the Caribbean, switching to slavery by the end of the 17th century as their economies converted from tobacco to sugar production. By the middle of the 18th century, British Jamaica and French Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) had become the largest slave societies of the region, rivaling Brazil as a destination for enslaved Africans.\n\nThe death rates for black slaves in these islands were higher than birth rates. The decrease averaged about 3 percent per year in Jamaica and 4 percent a year in the smaller islands. The diary of slaveowner Thomas Thistlewood of Jamaica details violence against slaves, and constitutes important historical documentation of the conditions for Caribbean slaves.\n\nFor centuries slavery made sugarcane production economical. The low level of technology made production difficult and labor-intensive. At the same time, the demand for sugar was rising, particularly in Great Britain. The French colony of Saint-Domingue quickly began to out-produce all of the British islands combined. Though sugar was driven by slavery, rising costs for the British made it easier for the British abolitionists to be heard.\n\nThe slavery system that developed in the Lesser Antilles was an outgrowth of the demand for sugar and other crops. The Spanish loosened its foothold in the Caribbean during the first half of the 17th century, which allowed the British to settle several islands and to ultimately seize Jamaica in 1655. To protect these investments, the British would later place a contingent of the Royal Navy in Port Royal.\n\nIn 1640 the English began sugar production with the help of the Dutch. This started the Anglo-American plantation societies which would later be led by Jamaica after it was fully developed. At its peak production between 1740 and 1807 Jamaica received 33% of the total slaves that were imported in order to keep up its production. Other crops besides sugar were also cultivated on the plantations. Tobacco, coffee, and livestock were all produced as well using slave labor. Sugar, however, stands out most prominently due to its exorbitant popularity during the time period and the dangers of its production, which claimed the lives of many.\n\nEngland had multiple sugar islands in the Caribbean, especially Jamaica, Barbados, Nevis, and Antigua, which provided a steady flow of sugar for sale; slave labor produced the sugar. An important result of Britain's victory in the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1714) was enlarging its role in the slave trade. Of special importance was the successful secret negotiation with France to obtain a 30-year monopoly on the Spanish slave trade, called the \"Asiento.\" Queen Anne of Great Britain also allowed her North American colonies like Virginia to make laws that promoted black slavery. Anne had secretly negotiated with France to get its approval regarding the \"asiento.\" She boasted to Parliament of her success in taking the \"asiento\" away from France and London celebrated her economic coup. Most of the slave trade involved sales to Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, and to Mexico, as well as sales to British colonies in the Caribbean and in North America. Historian Vinita Ricks says the agreement allotted Queen Anne \"22.5% (and King Philip V, of Spain 28%) of all profits collected for her personal fortune.\" Ricks concludes that the Queen's \"connection to slave trade revenue meant that she was no longer a neutral observer. She had a vested interest in what happened on slave ships.\"\n\nThe slaves incoming to the Anglo-American colonies were at high risk both mentally and physically. The Middle Passage alone accounted for roughly 10% of all deaths. Some experts believe that one out of every three slaves died before ever reaching their African port of departure. It should be mentioned that the majority of Anglo-American slaves came from Western Central Africa. These factors and others caused many slaves on arrival to feel alienated, fragile, and that death was right around the corner. The conditions suffered by slaves during the voyages were hostile. The slaves were placed in close quarters, fed barely enough to sustain them, and oftentimes they fell victim to diseases contracted prior to the voyage. The slaves would not see sunlight during this period and were prone to both weight loss and scurvy. \nThe living and working conditions in the Lesser Antilles were very harsh for the slaves that were brought in to work the plantations. The average life of a slave after \"adjusting\" to the climate and environmental conditions of Jamaica was expected to be less than two decades. This was due to their limited familiarly and immune defense against the diseases and illnesses present in Jamaica. Disease decimated incoming slave populations. Attempts were made to help curtail the problem, but ultimately were fruitless.\n\nTo help protect their investments, most planters would not immediately give the hardest tasks to the newest slaves. Slave owners would also set up a walled area away from the veteran slaves in order to stymie the spread of disease. These areas would contain 100–200 slaves at any time. Later, after new slaves had been bought, they would be placed into the care of older and more experienced slaves who were already accustomed to the plantation in hopes of increasing their chances for survival. Examples of tasks assigned to new slaves include planting and constructing buildings. Though newer slaves typically formed supportive relationships with veteran slaves taking, these relationships were not always positive, and abuse did occur.\n\nSugar production in the Lesser Antilles was a very grisly business. On Jamaica from 1829 to 1832 the average mortality rate for slaves on sugar plantations was 35.1 deaths per 1000 enslaved. The most dangerous part of the sugar plantation was the cane planting. Cane planting during this era consisted of clearing land, digging the holes for the plants, and more. Overseers used the whip in an attempt to both motivate and punish slaves. The slaves themselves were also working and living with barely adequate nourishment and in times of hard work would often be starved. This contributed to low birth rates and the high mortality rates for the slaves. Some experts believe that the average infant mortality at plantations to be 50% or even higher. This extremely high rate of infant mortality meant that the slave population that existed in the Lesser Antilles was not self-sustaining, thus requiring a constant importation of new slaves. Living and working conditions on non-sugar plantations was considered to be better, however, only marginally.\n\nSlavery was first abolished by the French Republic in 1794, but Napoleon revoked that decree in 1802. In 1815, the Republic abolished the slave trade but the decree did not come into effect until 1826. France re-abolished slavery in her colonies in 1848 with a general and unconditional emancipation.\nWilliam Wilberforce's Slave Trade Act 1807 abolished the slave trade in the British Empire. It was not until the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 that the institution finally was abolished, but on a gradual basis. Since slave owners in the various colonies (not only the Caribbean) were losing their unpaid labourers, the government set aside £20 million for compensation but it did not offer the former slaves reparations.\n\nThe colony of Trinidad was left with a shortage of labour. This shortage became worse after the abolition of slavery in 1833. To deal with this problem, Trinidad imported indentured servants from the 1810s until 1917. Initially Chinese, free West Africans, and Portuguese from the island of Madeira were imported, but they were soon supplanted by Indians who started arriving from 1845. Indentured Indians would prove to be an adequate alternative for the plantations that formerly relied upon slave labour. In addition, numerous former slaves migrated from the Lesser Antilles to Trinidad to work.\n\nIn 1811 on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, Arthur William Hodge, a wealthy plantation owner and Council member, became the first person to be hanged for the murder of a slave.\n\nWhitehall in Britain announced in 1833 that the gradual abolition would end by 1840; by then, and slaves in its territories would be totally freed. In the meantime, the government told slaves they had to remain on their plantations and would have the status of \"apprentices\" for the next six years. On 1 August 1834 in Trinidad, an unarmed group of mainly elderly Negroes being addressed by the Governor at Government House about the new apprenticeship laws, began chanting: \"\"Pas de six ans. Point de six ans\"\" (\"Not six years. No six years\"), drowning out the voice of the Governor. Peaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish apprenticeship was passed and \"de facto\" freedom was achieved. This made Trinidad the first British colony with slaves to completely abolish slavery. The successful resistance of the implementation of the full six-year term of the Apprenticeship system and Abolition of Slavery in Trinidad was marked by ex-slaves and free coloureds joining in celebrations thru the streets in what became known as their annual Canboulay celebrations. This event in Trinidad influenced full emancipation in the other British colonies which was legally granted two years ahead of schedule on 1 August 1838.\n\nAfter Great Britain abolished slavery, it began to pressure other nations to do the same. France finally abolished slavery in 1848. By then Saint-Domingue had already won its independence and formed the independent Republic of Haiti. French-controlled islands were then limited to a few smaller islands in the Lesser Antilles.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the lacrosse equivalent of football's Heisman Trophy. The award is presented by The Tewaaraton Foundation and the University Club of Washington, D.C..\n\nLacrosse is one of the oldest team sports played in North America and the award honors the Native American heritage of lacrosse in the name of its award, \"Tewaaraton,\" the Mohawk name for their game and the progenitor of present-day lacrosse. The Tewaaraton Award has received the endorsement of the Mohawk Nation Council of Elders. Each year, the award recognizes one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy: the Mohawk, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora tribes.\n\nThe award winners each receive a trophy of a bronze sculpture depicting a Mohawk native playing lacrosse. It was designed and created by Frederick Kail with the assistance of Thomas Vennum, Jr., a renowned Native American lacrosse historian and author, who consulted with Kail to ensure the trophy's historical authenticity. The 12-inch figure is mounted upon a hexagon-shaped slab of black granite and polished Cocobolo wood. The hexagonal base symbolizes the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy: the Mohawk, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora tribes. With some minor decorative exceptions, the stick is a replica of a pre-1845 Cayuga stick belonging to the grandfather of Alexander T. General of the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. This stick was an original predecessor of the modern-day lacrosse stick.\n\nPlayers are nominated for the award by coaches from all three NCAA divisions during the collegiate season. All Watch List nominees are then screened and selected by two Selection Committees. The Selection Committees are composed of collegiate coaches, one committee for the men and one committee for the women. At the conclusion of the season the selection committees meet to rank the top five male and female finalists. The finalists are then invited to the Awards Banquet, where the Tewaaraton Award winners are announced.\nIn addition to recognizing the top men’s and women’s collegiate lacrosse players, the Tewaaraton Award also recognizes the High School All-Tewaaraton team for both boys and girls lacrosse. This is a regional team which is composed of the best players from both private and public schools in the Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia area.\n\nThere is debate in the lacrosse community as to whether the Tewaaraton Award is actually an outstanding player award or whether it should be called a postseason award. The controversy stems from the fact that the awards is usually given to a player who plays well during the season-ending NCAA tournament and from a team which is the winner or runner up in the NCAA Tournament. The Lt. Raymond Enners Award is the USILA Outstanding Player of the Year Award selected by the NCAA coaches, and the Tewaaraton Award recipient has not been the same as the Raymond Enners Award recipient in 5 out of the first 11 years that the Tewaaraton was awarded. Since then, the two awards have agreed almost exactly; in each season but one from 2012 through 2019, both awards were won by the same individual. The only exception in this span was in 2014, when the Enners Award went to one of the two brothers who shared the Tewaaraton Award.\n\nSince 2011, the Tewaaraton Legend Award has been presented to one recipient each year who played collegiately prior to 2001 when the first Tewaaraton Award was presented, whose performance during their college years would have earned them a Tewaaraton Award had the award existed when they played. In 2016, the foundation began presenting both a men's and women's Legend Award.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1978056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978056", "title": "Red pill and blue pill", "text": "Red pill and blue pill\n\nThe red pill and blue pill is a meme representing a choice between taking either a \"red pill\" that reveals an unpleasant truth, or taking a \"blue pill\" to remain in blissful ignorance. The terms are directly derived from a scene in the 1999 film \"The Matrix\".\n\nIn \"The Matrix\", the main character Neo is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by rebel leader Morpheus. The red pill represents an uncertain future—it would free him from the enslaving control of the machine-generated dream world and allow him to escape into the real world, but living the \"truth of reality\" is harsher and more difficult. On the other hand, the blue pill represents a beautiful prison—it would lead him back to ignorance, living in confined comfort without want or fear within the simulated reality of the Matrix. As described by Morpheus: \"You take the blue pill...the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill...you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\" Neo chooses the red pill and joins the rebellion.\n\nThe science fiction film \"Total Recall\" (1990) features a red pill which is offered to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character, Douglas Quaid, by Dr. Edgemar. He is told \"it's a symbol of your desire to return to reality.\" No blue pill is present in the film, and the story centers on the uncertainty of whether Quaid is dreaming or in the real world. However, the pill is offered to him with the claim that he dreaming, and that the pill will return him to reality, with the words \"inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.\" Quaid seriously considers the offer but notices that Dr. Edgemar is sweating, whereupon he shoots him in the forehead. The implication is that the dream is not a dream but reality, Dr. Edgemar is part of the conspiracy against Quaid, and the pill is simply poison. He had also told Quaid that if Quaid killed him, \"the walls of reality will come crashing down\"; moments after his death, the walls of the hotel room literally come crashing down.\n\n\"The Matrix\" (1999), directed by the Wachowskis, makes references to historical myths and philosophy, including gnosticism, existentialism, and nihilism. The film's premise resembles Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Zhuangzi's \"Zhuangzi dreamed he was a butterfly\", René Descartes's skepticism and evil demon, Kant's reflections on the Phenomenon versus the \"Ding an sich\", Robert Nozick's \"experience machine\", the concept of a simulated reality and the brain in a vat thought experiment. \"The Matrix\" very clearly references \"Alice in Wonderland\" with the \"white rabbit\" and the \"down the rabbit hole\" phrases, as well as referring to Neo's path of discovery as \"Wonderland\".\n\nJapanese director Mamoru Oshii's anime film adaptation of Masamune Shirow's \"Ghost in the Shell\" was a strong influence.\n\nIn \"The Matrix\", Neo (Keanu Reeves) hears rumors of the Matrix and a mysterious man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Neo spends his nights at his home computer trying to discover the secret of the Matrix and what the Matrix is. Eventually, another hacker, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), introduces Neo to Morpheus.\n\nMorpheus explains to Neo that the Matrix is an illusory world created to prevent humans from discovering that they are slaves to an external influence. Holding out a capsule on each of his palms, he describes the choice facing Neo:\n\nAs narrated, the blue pill will allow the subject to remain in the fabricated reality of the Matrix; the red serves as a \"location device\" to locate the subject's body in the real world and to prepare him or her to be \"unplugged\" from the Matrix. Once one chooses the red or blue pill, the choice is irrevocable.\n\nNeo takes the red pill and awakens in the real world, where he is forcibly ejected from the liquid-filled chamber in which he has been lying unconscious. After his rescue and convalescence aboard Morpheus's ship, Morpheus shows him the true nature of the Matrix: a detailed computer simulation of Earth at the end of the 20th century (the actual year, though not known for sure, is approximately two hundred years later). It has been created to keep the minds of humans docile while their bodies are stored in massive power plants, their body heat and bioelectricity consumed as power by the sentient machines that have enslaved them.\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Lana Wachowski said:\nIn the 2013 movie version of \"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\", when Ben Stiller's character lands at Nuuk in Greenland, he asks the man in the airport booth: \"Do you have any cars available?\" \"Yeah, we have a blue one and a red one\", the man replies. \"I'll take the red one\", says Walter. \"The choice between the red and blue car at the rental car lot is worthy of mention, if only because it almost candidly pulls the idea from the red pill of \"The Matrix\". Two jelly bean, or pill, shaped cars , red and blue; the only thing missing is Lawrence Fishburne working the counter\". \"The passage connecting reality to illusion is often visualised using tangible things and physical environments [as] Neo took the red pill in \"The Matrix\".\"\n\nAn essay written by Russell Blackford discusses the red and blue pills, questioning whether if a person were fully informed they would take the red pill, opting for the real world, believing that the choice of physical reality over a digital simulation is not so beneficial as to be valid for all people. Both Neo and another character, Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), take the red pill over the blue pill, though later in the first \"Matrix\" film, the latter demonstrates regret for having made that choice, saying that if Morpheus fully informed him of the situation, Cypher would have told him to \"shove the red pill right up [his] ass.\" When Cypher subsequently makes a deal with the machines to return to the Matrix and forget everything he had learned, he says, \"Ignorance is bliss.\" Blackford argues that the \"Matrix\" films set things up so that even if Neo fails, the taking of the red pill is worthwhile because he lives and dies authentically. Blackford and science-fiction writer James Patrick Kelly feel that \"The Matrix\" stacks the deck against machines and their simulated world.\n\n\"Matrix Warrior: Being the One\" author Jake Horsley compared the red pill to LSD, citing a scene where Neo forms his own world outside of the Matrix. When he asks Morpheus if he could return, Morpheus responds by asking him if he would want to. Horsley also describes the blue pill as addictive, calling \"The Matrix\" series a continuous series of choices between taking the blue pill and not taking it. He adds that the habits and routines of people inside the Matrix are merely the people dosing themselves with the blue pill. While he describes the blue pill as a common thing, he states that the red pill is one of a kind, and something someone may not even find.\n\nIn the book \"The Art of the Start\", author Guy Kawasaki uses the red pill as an analogue to the situation of leaders of new organizations, in that they face the same choice to either live in reality or fantasy. He adds that if they want to be successful, they have to take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\n"}

It contains the President's birthplace, known as the \"Manse\", a Museum that explores the life and times of Woodrow Wilson (1856–1924), a Research Library, a gift shop, and several other buildings that are not open to the public. As Woodrow Wilson's presidency predates the National Presidential Libraries act, it is not part of the Federal National Archives' Presidential library system.\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson Birthplace is referred to as The Manse, which is the name of a Presbyterian minister's home. The Manse was constructed in 1846 by the Staunton First Presbyterian Church. It has twelve rooms with twelve fireplaces, and cost about $4,000. The Wilson family moved into the house in 1855 as his father was ordained as a Presbyterian pastor and called to serve as a pastor in Staunton. At that time the family consisted of his two parents, Jessie Woodrow Wilson and Joseph Ruggles Wilson, and their two daughters Marion and Annie, who were about four and two years old, respectively. Thomas Woodrow Wilson was born in what is now called the \"birth room\" on December 28, 1856. The Wilsons left The Manse in 1858 when Joseph Wilson accepted a call from a congregation in Augusta, Georgia.\n\nWilson continued to visit Staunton throughout his life and often called Staunton his home. After his election to the Presidency in 1912, Wilson and his wife Ellen visited Staunton over his birthday in December of that year and spent two nights in the Manse as a guest of his good friend Rev Frazier who was then the Minister at the First Presbyterian Church of Staunton\n\nAfter the Wilsons moved out of The Manse it remained the Presbyterian minister's until the 1920s. It was after the former President's death in 1924 that his widow Edith Bolling Galt Wilson along with former cabinet members and Staunton community members decided to create a Birthplace museum to commemorate Wilson's life.\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson Birthplace Foundation was officially incorporated in 1938, and the house was restored to its 1850s look over the next 80 years, which included removing bathrooms, changing light fixtures, and stripping paint. The house was opened to the public in 1941, being formally dedicated as a museum by President Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nIt was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. It is located in the Gospel Hill Historic District.\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library houses Woodrow Wilson materials from during and immediately after his lifetime, memoirs of those who worked with him, and governmental volumes concerning World War I. The library is located at 235 East Beverley Street in Staunton, Virginia.\n\nThe Library has the third largest collection of Woodrow Wilson Papers. Wilson's official papers are located at The Library of Congress. Princeton University also maintains a large collection of Wilson papers from his tenure as Professor and President of the University. The Woodrow Wilson Library focuses on the digitization all of the President's papers and other materials in order to make the papers more accessible to the general public. It is open to researchers by appointment only.\n\nThe Museum, opened to the public in 1990, is on North Coalter street two doors down from the Manse and in front of the library. The Museum contains eight museum galleries that focus on the life and times of Wilson. Highlights of the museum include the president's 1919 Pierce Arrow limousine and an interactive trench exhibit based on a World War I trench.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1978058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978058", "title": "Herstigte Nasionale Party", "text": "Herstigte Nasionale Party\n\nThe Herstigte Nasionale Party (Reconstituted National Party) is a South African political party which was formed as a far-right splinter group of the now defunct National Party in 1969. The party name was commonly abbreviated as HNP, although colloquially they were also known as the Herstigtes.\n\nThe HNP was formed in 1969 by Albert Hertzog (son of former Prime Minister General JBM Hertzog) in protest against the decision by Prime Minister B.J. Vorster to authorize the presence of Maori players and spectators during the tour of New Zealand rugby union team in South Africa in 1970. He was also against Vorster's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Malawi and that country's appointment of a Black ambassador to South Africa. The name was chosen to reflect the initials of the earlier Herenigde Nasionale Party (Reunited National Party), the name used by the National Party in the election of 1948. Seeking a return to Calvinism as the basis of South Africa, the party advocated complete racial segregation and the adoption of Afrikaans as the only official language. The bulk of the membership of the new party was made up of rural and small town working and lower middle class Afrikaners who resented what they saw as the National Party devoting their attentions to the concerns of urban Afrikaner elites. The Afrikaner Broederbond denied membership to any HNP member.\n\nThe party contested the 1970 general election although its campaign was the subject of government crackdowns and attacks. The party's 78 candidates were all defeated, including its four Members of Parliament, all of whom had been National Party members before defecting to the new HNP. The party also contested 50 seats in the 1974 general election but failed to make an impact in an election where reformists advanced. During this election the HNP boycotted the English language press, as the party opposed the use of the language. It also contested three by-elections in 1975 and 1976 and enjoyed some growth, taking second place ahead of the United Party in the two seats that that group contested. The HNP captured 3.3% of the vote in the 1977 general election before increasing to 14.1% in 1981 as right wing disenchantment with the NP grew, but on no occasion did it win any seats and its newly acquired voters soon shifted their support to the Conservative Party.\n\nEugène Terre'Blanche had been a member of the HNP, but broke with the group in 1973, after becoming disillusioned with their adherence to electoral politics. He then established the paramilitary Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging. He also differed from the HNP in his belief in the establishment of a white homeland in South Africa, something the HNP rejected as unnecessary.\n\nUnder the leadership of Jaap Marais, the former deputy leader who replaced the retiring Hertzog in 1977, the party emerged as a force amongst white South Africans. In 1979 the evidence of its potential was demonstrated in a series of by-elections when it seemed to threaten the position of the ruling party. Despite obtaining 14.1% support in the 1981 general election, the HNP never managed to gain seats in the South African parliament in a general election and remained only a voice of external opposition. However in October 1985 the party's general secretary Louis Stofberg won a by-election in Sasolburg on a campaign based on the presence of a mixed couple in the constituency and claims that the white population paid more tax than the other ethnic groups. The victory came despite a breakdown in the electoral alliance between the HNP and the Conservative Party that had been established earlier that year, with Andries Treurnicht claiming it was a first step to merging the HNP into the Conservatives, something that Marais did not want.\n\nThe HNP effectively became the chief voice of the far-right, particularly in 1989 when both the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and the Boerestaat Party declared their support for Marais. The group's only previous contact with other parties had been in 1985 when it briefly co-operated with the Conservative Party to oppose the repeal of the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act and the Immorality Amendment Act by P.W. Botha.\n\nOn the international stage, the HNP built up a number of contacts with far-right groups in Europe and for a time during the 1980s it was responsible for funding the United Kingdom-based League of Saint George. It was also closely associated with the South African National Front (SANF), an overseas branch of the National Front in the United Kingdom. Between 1980 and 1987 the party bankrolled the English-speaking far-right journal \"South African Patriot\", edited by SANF members John Hiddleston and then Alan Harvey.\n\nThe HNP joined the Afrikaner Volksfront of General Constand Viljoen in 1991, but the front collapsed in 1994 when many of the members refused to participate in South Africa's first multi-racial elections. The HNP drifted away from Viljoen and did not join his Freedom Front party. As a result, it has become something of a marginal force in contemporary South Africa, arguing for the self-determination of white Afrikaners and a return to Verwoerdian apartheid. The party motto is now \"Dié Land is ons Land\" (This land is our land).\n\nIt re-emerged in 2004, when the party lodged an official complaint against SABC 3 when it broadcast a play entitled \"ID\" which satirised the killing of Hendrik Verwoerd. Although the HNP argued that it portrayed Verwoerd and his supporters unfairly, the complaint was rejected by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa.\n\nJaap Marais died in 2000, and was replaced as leader by Willie Marais. Willie Marais died in December 2007, and was replaced as by Japie Theart. The present leader is Andries Breytenbach. Two splits have occurred from the party over ideology and tactics: the Afrikaner Nationalist Movement in 2004, and the Afrikaner Volksparty in 2008.\n\nWhen founded, the HNP emphasised above all its Afrikaner identity, attacking immigration, seeking to downgrade the importance of the English language, and endorsing apartheid. The party also launched an attack on the materialism that it felt was taking over South African society and thus sought to present itself as the voice of working class Afrikaners. It frequently attacked the \"liberalism\" of the National Party regime, arguing that it was gradually diluting apartheid and offering too many concessions to non-Whites.\n\nThe party rejects the idea of a separate Volkstaat specifically for Afrikaners, claiming all of South Africa for Afrikaners instead. It believes that the interests of the black population will be sufficiently met in the former black homelands. The HNP has no clear plan for how a return to Verwoerdian South Africa could be achieved. The party also emphasises the importance of Calvinism to the South African identity.\n\nThe party does not recognise the new order in South Africa and, as part of its policy of resistance, encourages people not to vote. That makes it impossible to determine the exact level of support the party has.\n\nWhile South Africa administered Namibia until 1988, the party was active in the country in opposition to independence and black rights. It contested the first multi-ethnic election in 1978, capturing 1.8% of the vote, or 10% of the White vote. The election resulted in a landslide win for the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance of Namibia, albeit with the main black opposition parties, the South West Africa People's Organization and the Namibia National Front, excluded from the ballot.\n\n"}
{"id": "1978061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978061", "title": "Transfer-messenger RNA", "text": "Transfer-messenger RNA\n\nTransfer-messenger RNA (abbreviated tmRNA, also known as 10Sa RNA and by its genetic name SsrA) is a bacterial RNA molecule with dual tRNA-like and messenger RNA-like properties. The tmRNA forms a ribonucleoprotein complex (tmRNP) together with Small Protein B (SmpB), Elongation Factor Tu (EF-Tu), and ribosomal protein S1. In \"trans\"-translation, tmRNA and its associated proteins bind to bacterial ribosomes which have stalled in the middle of protein biosynthesis, for example when reaching the end of a messenger RNA which has lost its stop codon. The tmRNA is remarkably versatile: it recycles the stalled ribosome, adds a proteolysis-inducing tag to the unfinished polypeptide, and facilitates the degradation of the aberrant messenger RNA. In the majority of bacteria these functions are carried out by standard one-piece tmRNAs. In other bacterial species, a permuted \"ssrA\" gene produces a two-piece tmRNA in which two separate RNA chains are joined by base-pairing. \n\ntmRNA was first designated 10Sa RNA after a mixed \"10S\" electrophoretic fraction of \"Escherichia coli\" RNA was further resolved into tmRNA and the similarly-sized RNase P RNA (10Sb). The presence of pseudouridine in the mixed 10S RNA hinted that tmRNA has modified bases found also in tRNA. The similarity at the 3' end of tmRNA to the T stem-loop of tRNA was first recognized upon sequencing \"ssrA\" from \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\". Subsequent sequence comparison revealed the full tRNA-like domain (TLD) formed by the 5' and 3' ends of tmRNA, including the acceptor stem with elements like those in alanine tRNA that promote its aminoacylation by alanine-tRNA ligase. It also revealed differences from tRNA: the anticodon arm is missing in tmRNA, and the D arm region is a loop without base pairs.\n\nThe complete \"E. coli\" tmRNA secondary structure was elucidated by comparative sequence analysis and structural probing. Watson-Crick and G-U base pairs were identified by comparing the bacterial tmRNA sequences using automated computational methods in combination with manual alignment procedures. The accompanying figure shows the base pairing pattern of this prototypical tmRNA, which is organized into 12 phylogenetically supported helices (also called pairings P1 to P12), some divided into helical segments.\n\nA prominent feature of every tmRNA is the conserved tRNA-like domain (TLD), composed of helices 1, 12, and 2a (analogs of the tRNA acceptor stem, T-stem and variable stem, respectively), and containing the 5' monophosphate and alanylatable 3' CCA ends. The mRNA-like region (MLR) is in standard tmRNA a large loop containing pseudoknots and a coding sequence (CDS) for the tag peptide, marked by the resume codon and the stop codon. The encoded tag peptide (ANDENYALAA in \"E. coli\") varies among bacteria, perhaps depending on the set of proteases and adaptors available.\n\ntmRNAs typically contain four pseudoknots, one (pk1) upstream of the tag peptide CDS, and the other three pseudoknots (pk2 to pk4) downstream of the CDS. The pseudoknot regions, although generally conserved, are evolutionarily plastic. For example, in the (one-piece) tmRNAs of cyanobacteria, pk4 is substituted with two tandemly arranged smaller pseudoknots. This suggests that tmRNA folding outside the TLD can be important, yet the pseudoknot region lacks conserved residues and pseudoknots are among the first structures to be lost as \"ssrA\" sequences diverge in plastid and endosymbiont lineages. Base pairing in the three-pseudoknot region of \"E. coli\" tmRNA is disrupted during \"trans\"-translation.\n\nCircularly permuted \"ssrA\" has been reported in three major lineages: i) all alphaproteobacteria and the primitive mitochondria of jakobid protists, ii) two disjoint groups of cyanobacteria (\"Gloeobacter\" and a clade containing \"Prochlorococcus\" and many \"Synechococcus\"), and iii) some members of the betaproteobacteria (\"Cupriavidus\" and some Rhodocyclales). All produce the same overall two-piece (acceptor and coding pieces) form, equivalent to the standard form nicked downstream of the reading frame. None retain more than two pseudoknots compared to the four (or more) of standard tmRNA.\n\nAlphaproteobacteria have two signature sequences: replacement of the typical T-loop sequence TΨCRANY with GGCRGUA, and the sequence AACAGAA in the large loop of the 3´-terminal pseudoknot. In mitochondria, the MLR has been lost, and a remarkable re-permutation of mitochondrial \"ssrA\" results in a small one-piece product in \"Jakoba libera\".\n\nThe cyanobacteria provide the most plausible case for evolution of a permuted gene from a standard gene, due to remarkable sequence similarities between the two gene types as they occur in different \"Synechococcus\" strains.\n\nMost tmRNAs are transcribed as larger precursors which are processed much like tRNA. Cleavage at the 5´ end is by ribonuclease P. Multiple exonucleases can participate in the processing of the 3´ end of tmRNA, although RNase T and RNase PH are most effective. Depending on the bacterial species, the 3'-CCA is either encoded or added by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase.\n\nSimilar processing at internal sites of permuted precursor tmRNA explains its physical splitting into two pieces. The two-piece tmRNAs have two additional ends whose processing must be considered. For alphaproteobacteria, one 5´ end is the unprocessed start site of transcription. The far 3´ end may in some cases be the result of rho-independent termination.\n\nHigh-resolution structures of the complete tmRNA molecules are currently unavailable and may be difficult to obtain due the inherent flexibility of the MLR. In 2007, \nthe crystal structure of the \"Thermus thermophilus\" TLD bound to the SmpB protein was obtained at 3 Å resolution. This structure shows that SmpB mimics the D stem and the anticodon of a canonical tRNA whereas helical section 2a of tmRNA corresponds to the variable arm of tRNA.\nA cryo-electron microscopy study of tmRNA at an early stage of \"trans\"-translation shows the spatial relationship between the ribosome and the tmRNP (tmRNA bound to the EF-Tu protein). The TLD is located near the GTPase-associated center in the 50S ribosomal subunit; helix 5 and pseudoknots pk2 to pk4 form an arc around the beak of the 30S ribosomal subunit.\n\nCoding by tmRNA was discovered in 1995 when Simpson and coworkers overexpressed the mouse cytokine IL-6 in \"E. coli\" and found multiple truncated cytokine-derived peptides each tagged at the carboxyl termini with the same 11-amino acid residue extension (A)ANDENYALAA. With the exception of the N-terminal alanine, which comes from the 3' end of tmRNA itself, this tag sequence was traced to a short open reading frame in \"E. coli\" tmRNA. Recognizing that the tag peptide confers proteolysis, the \"trans\"-translation model for tmRNA action was proposed.\n\nWhile details of the \"trans\"-translation mechanism are under investigation it is generally agreed that tmRNA first occupies the empty A site of the stalled ribosome. Subsequently, the ribosome moves from the 3' end of the truncated messenger RNA onto the resume codon of the MLR, followed by a slippage-prone stage from where translation continues normally until the in-frame tmRNA stop codon is encountered. \"Trans-translation\" is essential in some bacterial species, whereas other bacteria require tmRNA to survive when subjected to stressful growth conditions. Depending on the organism, the tag peptide may be recognized by a variety of proteases or protease adapters.\n\n\"ssrA\" is both a target for some mobile DNAs and a passenger on others. It has been found interrupted by three types of mobile elements. By different strategies none of these disrupt gene function: group I introns remove themselves by self-splicing, rickettsial palindromic elements (RPEs) insert in innocuous sites, and integrase-encoding genomic islands split their target \"ssrA\" yet restore the split-off portion.\n\nNon-chromosomal \"ssrA\" was first detected in a genomic survey of mycobacteriophages (in 10% of the phages). Other mobile elements including plasmids and genomic islands have been found bearing \"ssrA\". One interesting case is \"Rhodobacter sphaeroides\" ATCC 17025, whose native tmRNA gene is disrupted by a genomic island; unlike all other genomic islands in tmRNA (or tRNA) genes this island has inactivated the native target gene without restoration, yet compensates by carrying its own tmRNA gene. A very unusual relative of \"ssrA\" is found in the lytic mycobacteriophage DS6A, that encodes little more than the TLD.\n\nA mitochondrion-encoded, structurally reduced form of tmRNA (mt-tmRNA) was first postulated for the jakobid flagellate \"Reclinomonas americana\". Subsequently, the presence of a mitochondrial gene (\"ssrA\") coding for tmRNA, as well as transcription and RNA processing sites were confirmed for all but one member of jakobids. Functional evidence, i.e., mt-tmRNA Aminoacylation with alanine, is available for \"Jakoba libera\". \nMore recently, \"ssrA\" was also identified in mitochondrial genomes of oomycetes. Like in α-Proteobacteria (the ancestors of mitochondria), mt-tmRNAs are circularly permuted, two-piece RNA molecules, except in \"Jakoba libera\" where the gene has reverted to encoding a one-piece tmRNA conformation.\n\nMitochondrial tmRNA genes were initially recognized as short sequences that are conserved among jakobids and that have the potential to fold into a distinct tRNA-like secondary structure. With the availability of nine complete jakobid mtDNA sequences, and a significantly improved covariance search tool (Infernal;), a covariance model has been developed based on jakobid mitochondrial tmRNAs, which identified mitochondrial \"ssrA\" genes also in oomycete. At present, a total of 34 oomycete mt-tmRNAs have been detected across six genera: \"Albugo, Bremia, Phytophthora, Pseudoperonospora, Pythium\" and \"Saprolegnia\". A covariance model built with both jakobid and oomycete sequences is now available at Rfam under the name ‘mt-tmRNA’.\n\nThe standard bacterial tmRNA consists of a tRNA(Ala)-like domain (allowing addition of a non-encoded alanine to mRNAs that happen to lack a stop coding), and an mRNA-like domain coding for a protein tag that destines the polypeptide for proteolysis. The mRNA-like domain was lost in mt-tmRNAs. \nComparative sequence analysis indicates features typical for mt-tmRNAs. \nMost conserved is the primary sequence of the amino acyl acceptor stem. This portion of the molecule has an invariable A residue in the discriminator position and a G-U pair at position 3 (except in S\"eculamonas ecuadoriensis\", which has a G-C pair); this position is the recognition site for alanyl tRNA synthase. P2 is a helix of variable length (3 to 10 base pairs) and corresponds to the anticodon stem of tRNAs, yet without an anticodon loop (as not required for tmRNA function). P2 stabilizes the tRNA-like structure, but four nucleotides invariant across oomycetes and jakobids suggest an additional, currently unidentified function. P3 has five base pairs and corresponds to the T-arm of tRNAs, yet with different consensus nucleotides both in the paired region and the loop. The T-loop sequence is conserved across oomycetes and jakobid, with only few deviations (e.g., \"Saprolegnia ferax\"). Finally, instead of the tRNA-like D-stem with a shortened three-nucleotide D-loop characteristic for bacterial tmRNAs, mitochondrial counterparts have a highly variable 5 to 14-nt long loop. \nThe intervening sequence (Int.) of two-piece mt-tmRNAs is A+U rich and of irregular length (4-34 nt). ). For secondary structure models of one- and two-piece mt-tmRNAs see Figure 1.\n\nRNA-Seq data of \"Phytophthora sojae\" show an expression level similar to that of neighboring mitochondrial tRNAs, and four major processing sites confirm the predicted termini of mature mt-tmRNA. The tmRNA precursor molecule is likely processed by RNase P and a tRNA 3’ processing endonuclease (see Figure 2); the latter activity is assumed to lead to the removal of the intervening sequence. Following the addition of CCA at the 3’ discriminator nucleotide, the tmRNA can be charged by alanyl-tRNA synthetase with alanine.\n\n\n"}

Leibell III (born August 6, 1946) is a former politician from Putnam County, New York. After a long career in the New York State Legislature, Leibell ran for and was elected county executive in 2010, but resigned prior to taking office following an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation which led to his arrest and subsequent conviction on federal corruption charges.\n\nHis resignation was in connection with a Federal plea arrangement stemming from two felony convictions relating to kickbacks Leibell had received while using his position as State Senator to steer taxpayer monies towards two local non-profit agencies which he controlled. In November 2012, he was released to a halfway house after completed serving 17-months of his 21-month prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institute in Loretto, Pennsylvania.\n\nLeibell was born in New York City. His grandfather and namesake was a federal judge, Vincent L. Leibell.\n\nLeibell worked as an Assistant District Attorney in the Westchester County District Attorney's office. He was a Captain in the United States Navy and a Rear Admiral in the New York Naval Militia.\n\nHe is married, with three children. He received his BA and JD from Saint John's University, as well as an MPA from New York University. Because he was convicted of two felony counts of corruption in 2010, Leibell was forced to forfeit his law license. According to the \"Daily News\", Leibell plead guilty to two charges to end a Federal investigation of him.\n\nLeibell entered politics as a Republican. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 1994, sitting in the 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th. In November 1994, he was elected to the State Senate, defeating Ex-Lieutenant Governor Alfred DelBello.\n\nLeibell was a member of the New York State Senate from 1995 to 2010, sitting in the 191st, 192nd, 193rd, 194th, 195th, 196th, 197th and 198th New York State Legislatures. In November 2010, he was elected Putnam County Executive. Over the years, he attracted controversy for his reputation for patronage and as a political kingmaker in Putnam County - the local newspaper cited the rumor that his preferred method of handling political opposition was to \"kill them in the cradle.\"\n\nAlthough he had a twenty-eight year career in the State Legislature, Leibell was not particularly known for his legislative accomplishments and passed no significant legislation with his name attached to it, yet Leibell's largesse with so-called pork barrel spending and ability to \"bring home the bacon\" earned him the moniker \"Uncle Vinnie\".\n\nEven after being convicted of two felonies, Leibell attracted further scandal when it was revealed he used campaign funds to spend $931 on new tires and $267 in Barnes and Nobles visits days after pleading guilty on Federal corruption charges. The government watchdog group Citizens Union called Leibell's actions part of a \"legislative crime wave\" in New York State, and named Leibell one of 17 legislators who lost their seat due to criminal issues from 2004 to 2010.\n\nOn June 26, 2010, the \"Journal News\" reported that FBI subpoenaed records for the home that Leibell built in Patterson, New York. On December 6, 2010, Leibell pleaded guilty to felony bribery, tax evasion, and obstruction of justice charges related to $43,000 in cash kickbacks he took from 2003 to 2006. Leibell had resigned from the State Senate on December 2, 2010, just prior to being arrested, which controversially due to a loophole in the New York State pension system allows him to keep a $71,000 pension despite his conviction.\n\nThe charges stated Leibell doled out $6.5 million in taxpayer funded \"member items\" to nonprofit groups he controlled from 2005 to 2010, according to records maintained by the Empire Center for New York State Policy and the Albany Project. He was sentenced to twenty one months in Federal Prison, after a Federal Judge rejected a plea by Leibell's lawyer to have the former Senator sent overseas to do \"nation building work\" in the Middle East instead of jailtime, a suggestion which outraged the media and local residents whom Leibell had betrayed by his actions.\n\nThe Leibell property in Patterson, New York formerly belonged to the late actress Elizabeth Montgomery, who employed Leibell's law firm to attend to certain legal matters. Leibell later purchased a portion of the property after the settlement of the Montgomery estate. Through use of Leibell's Senate position, the rest of the land became Wonder Lake State Park, which, from its founding in 1998 until 2006, had no discernible public access points.\n\nCritics called Wonder Lake a personal park for the Senator, but Lebeill tried to assert it was used by hikers, though the park was shuttered nonetheless by the State amidst the 2010 New York State budget crisis. Leibell also used $230,000 in taxpayer dollars to construct a wooden footbridge on Route 311 in Patterson which critics derided as a \"bridge to nowhere.\" Ironically, Leibell had moved to the home from Tammany Hall Road, named after the corrupt political machine run by Boss Tweed in mid-19th century New York.\n\n\"Leibell has only himself to blame for the fact that, after 28 years in public office, this conviction will be the capstone to that career,\" said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan who announced Leibell's guilty plea. Bharara explained that the FBI recorded Leibell threatening not to pay invoices sent to Leibell's 501(c)(3) nonprofit by an unnamed attorney unless the attorney paid half of the invoice amount back to Leibell in cash.\n"}

They hadn't been there more than a few months before only Inger and guitarist Geoff Siegel were left, and replaced the other two with guitarist Sam Merrick, drummer Alex Kirst and bassist Cliff D. (Cliff Jones).\n\nThe band's distinctive sound, a mixture of punk rock and goth, glam and grunge, and image began to attract the attention of major record labels. At the time, the band simply wanted to sign to an Indie label, as most grunge and punk bands did before the 1991 success of Nirvana's \"Nevermind\", but by 1989 the Nymphs were signed to Geffen Records with a nearly million-dollar recording contract. The band even made a brief appearance in the film \"Bad Influence\" performing \"The Highway\", a song Lorre wrote about a young girl infatuated with serial killer Richard Ramirez.\n\nIt was at about this time that the Nymphs began to have problems with their label. Almost two years had passed since the Nymphs had completed their album. Lorre was losing her battle with heroin and in an alcohol induced fit she urinated on the desk of A&R man Tom Zutaut. \"\"Rolling Stone\" quipped, 'Talk about being pissed at your record label.'\" The band fired Lorre when she refused to go on stage in Miami opening for Peter Murphy. \nAn EP called \"The Practical Guide to Astral Projection\" was released the same year but it failed to chart.\n\nLorre returned to New Jersey for several years. A few spots here and there over time, where Lorre popped up in various places, never evolved into a Nymphs reunion or second album. In 1995, she teamed up with Motel Shootout and released the single \"Burn,\" on old friend Long Gone John's label, Sympathy for the Record Industry. She entered rehab and worked toward permanent recovery.\n\nShe befriended singer Jeff Buckley and they began collaborating on music. Lorre's vocals are featured on \"Angel Mine\" while Jeff played guitar, sitar, and mouth sax on the track, released on the Jack Kerouac tribute album \"Kicks Joy Darkness\". Jeff and Lorre duetted again on the track \"Thief Without The Take\" contained on Lorre's album \"Transcendental Medication\". Buckley also covered \"Yard of Blonde Girls\" co-written by Lorre, which appeared on \"Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk\". Sadly, at the height of his popularity, Buckley drowned during an evening swim on May 29, 1997, before the album's release. Lorre reemerged from New Jersey with her solo album, \"Transcendental Medication\" released on Triple X Records in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Lorre moved back to Los Angeles, where she painted and appeared in group shows around the city. She made a cameo appearance in the 2001 indie film \"Down and Out with the Dolls\", a raunchy, wry and in-your-face tale of the fast rise and fall of an all-girl, four-piece Portland rock band. She performed a cover of Black Flag's \"Slip It In\" with Henry Rollins on the 2002 album \"\".\n\nOn July 17, 2004, Lorre played an acoustic show at Hollywood's The Knitting Factory, performing Nymphs songs, new songs and covers. In 2006, a version of The Nymphs popped up in a few places. There were plans to have a reunion with all original members, but with the death of original drummer Alex Kirst, it seems unlikely.\n\nOn 3 April 2016, Lorre announced in a Facebook post that she would be performing a show on 27 May 2016 at The Viper Room, \"doing 99% Nymphs songs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It comprised the town of Reading in the county of Berkshire.\n\nFrom 1295, as a parliamentary borough, Reading elected two members of parliament (MPs). Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885,this representation was reduced to a single MP. The constituency was abolished in 1950, re-created in 1955, and finally abolished in 1974.\n\nReading was one of the boroughs summoned to send members to the Model Parliament. The boundaries (encompassing the whole of one parish and parts of two others) were effectively unchanged from 1295 to 1918. In 1831, the population of the borough was 15,935, and contained 3,307 houses.\n\nThe right to vote was exercised by all inhabitants paying scot and lot, a relatively wide franchise for the period, and almost 2,000 votes were cast at the general election of 1826. Despite this high electorate, the corporation of the town was generally considered in practice to control elections to a large extent. In the second half of the 18th century, Reading was notoriously one of the most corrupt constituencies in England, bribery being both routine and expensive: Namier quotes the accounts kept for Prime Minister Newcastle of the 1754 election, which note that John Dodd, the government's candidate there, had already received £1000 and was promised £500 or £600 more to help him win the seat. (Dodd lost by one vote, but had the result overturned on petition by a partisan vote in the House of Commons, and Newcastle's accounts show a continuing trickle of funds to him to nurse the constituency over the next few years.) A few years later, the nomination to one of Reading's seats was advertised for sale in a London newspaper, though Reading was not mentioned by name and no price was specified; the newspaper's printers were charged by the Commons with a breach of privilege, but the sale of seats remained legal if frowned-upon until 1809.\n\nThe Great Reform Act left Reading's representation and boundaries unchanged, and the reformed franchise far from increasing its electorate seems to have reduced it: it was estimated that there were 1,250 voters in 1831, but only 1,001 were registered for the first post-Reform election, that of 1832.\n\nThe Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, coming into effect at the 1885 general election, reduced the representation of the parliamentary borough to a single MP. The single-member Reading constituency continued to exist until it was split in 1950 into the separate constituencies of Reading North and Reading South. These two constituencies were merged back into a single Reading constituency in 1955, but again split apart in 1974; despite its name, the 1955 constituency contained only ten wards of the County Borough of Reading. Today the area formerly covered by the Reading constituency is within the constituencies of Reading East and Reading West.\n\n1918–1950: The County Borough of Reading.\n\nBoundaries extended to the south and west (gained from the Newbury and Wokingham Divisions of Berkshire), and to the north of the River Thames with the annexation of the Urban District of Caversham (part of the Henley Division of Oxfordshire) by Reading County Borough.\n\nFor the 1950 general election, Reading was abolished as a single-member Parliamentary Borough and split between the two new Borough Constituencies of Reading North and Reading South.\n\n1955–1974: For the 1955 general election, Reading was re-established as Borough Constituency, replacing Reading North and Reading South and comprising the County Borough of Reading wards of Abbey, Battle, Castle, Caversham East, Caversham West, Church, Katesgrove, Minster, Redlands, Victoria, West. The East and Tilehurst wards were respectively included in the Wokingham and Newbury constituencies.\n\nFrom the 1964 general election, following a revision to the County Borough wards, the constituency comprised the wards of Abbey, Battle, Castle, Caversham, Christchurch, Katesgrove, Minster, Redlands, Thames, and Whitley, resulting in minor changes.\n\nThe constituency was abolished once again for the 1974 general election. Christchurch, Redlands and Whitley wards were included in the re-established County Constituency of Reading South, with remaining wards being included in the re-established Borough Constituency of Reading North.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nTalfourd resigned after being appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas, causing a by-election.\n\n \n\nKeating was appointed Solicitor General for England and Wales, requiring a by-election.\n\nKeating was appointed Solicitor General for England and Wales, requiring a by-election.\n\nKeating resigned after being appointed a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, causing a by-election.\n\nPigott resigned after being appointed Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, causing a by-election.\n\nPigott resigned after being appointed a Judge of the Court of the Exchequer, causing a by-election.\n\nShaw-Lefevre was appointed a Civil Lord of the Admiralty, requiring a by-election.\n\nGoldsmid's death caused a by-election.\n\n \n\nLefevre was appointed First Commissioner of Works and Public Buildings, requiring a by-election.\n\nMurdoch's death caused a by-election.\n\nIsaacs is appointed Solicitor General of England and Wales, requiring a by-election.\n\nIssacs is appointed Lord Chief Justice of England and is elevated to the peerage as Lord Reading, requiring a by-election.\n\nA General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915.

{"id": "1978091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978091", "title": "Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies", "text": "Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies\n\nSlavery in the Spanish American colonies was an economic and social institution which existed throughout the Spanish Empire. In its American territories, it initially bound indigenous people and later individuals of African origin. \n\nThe Spanish progressively restricted and outright forbaded the enslavement of Native Americans in the early years of the Spanish Empire with the Laws of Burgos of 1512 and the New Laws of 1543. The latter led to the abolition of the Encomienda, private grants of groups of Native Americans to individual Spaniards and their Mestizo descendants. The implementation of the New Laws and liberation of tens of thousands of Native Americas led to a number of rebellions and conspiracies by \"Encomenderos\" (Encomienda holders) which had to be put down by the Spanish Crown. Asians (\"chinos\") in colonial Mexico had the same status as Native Americans and thus were forbidden to be enslaved by law. \n\nSpain had a precedent for slavery as an institution since it existed in Spain itself since times of the Roman Empire. Slavery also existed among Native Americans of both Meso-America and South America. The Crown attempted to limit the bondage of indigenous people, rejecting slavery based on race. Spaniards regarded indigenous forced labor and tribute as rewards for participation in the conquest. The crown gave some conquerors encomiendas Formally, the indigenous held in encomienda were not slaves, but their labor was mandatory and coerced. With the collapse of indigenous populations in the Caribbean, where Spaniards created permanent settlements starting in 1493, Spaniards raided other islands and the mainland for indigenous brought to Hispaniola as slaves. With the rise sugar cultivation as an export product, Spaniards increasingly utilized enslaved Africans for labor on commercial plantations. Although plantation slavery in Spanish America was one aspect slave labor, urban slavery in households, religious institutions, textile workshops (\"obrajes\"), and other venues was also important.\n\nSpanish slavery in the Americas diverged drastically from other European colonies in that it took on an early abolitionist stance towards Native American slavery. Although it did not directly partake in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, black slaves were sold throughout the Spanish Empire, particularly in Caribbean territories. This trade helped transfer American wealth to Europe and promoted racial hierarchies (\"castas\") throughout the empire. Spanish enslavers justified their wealth and status earned at the work of the mines at the expense of captive workers by considering them inferior beings with limited capacities and holding them as personal property (chattel slavery), often under barbarous conditions. Spanish colonization set some egregious records for slavery. The Asiento, the official contract for trading in slaves in the vast Spanish territories was a major engine of the Atlantic slave trade. When Spain first enslaved Native Americans on Hispaniola, and then replaced them with captive Africans, it established unfree labor as the basis for colonial mass-production. Subsequently, in the mid-nineteenth century when most countries in the Americas reformed to disallow chattel slavery, Cuba and Puerto Rico – the last two remaining Spanish American colonies – maintained slavery the longest.\n\nEnslaved people challenged their captivity in ways that ranged from introducing non-European elements into Christianity (syncretism) to mounting alternative societies outside the plantation system (Maroons). The first open black rebellion occurred in Spanish plantations in 1521. Resistance, particularly to the enslavement of indigenous people, also came from Spanish religious and legal ranks. The first speech in the Americas for the universality of human rights and against the abuses of slavery was also given on Hispaniola, a mere nineteen years after the first contact. Resistance to Amerindian captivity in the Spanish colonies produced the first modern debates over race and the legitimacy of slavery. And uniquely in the Spanish American colonies, laws like the New Laws of 1542, were enacted early in the colonial period to protect natives from bondage. To complicate matters further, Spain's haphazard grip on its extensive American dominions and its erratic economy acted to impede the broad and systematic spread of plantations similar to those of the French in Saint Domingue or of the British in Jamaica. Altogether, the struggle against slavery in the Spanish American colonies left a notable tradition of opposition that set the stage for current conversations about human rights.\n\nThe Roman Empire extensively utilized chattel slavery for labor, private property that could be disposed at will, and slaves' status was specified in the Code of Justinian, but slaves' ethnicity or race was not specified. With the rise of Christianity, the status of slaves was not altered, but slaves were to be converted to Christianity. Christians were in theory banned from enslaving fellow Christians, but the practice persisted. With the rise of Islam, and the conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula in the eighth century, slavery declined in remaining Iberian Christian kingdoms. Muslims were resistant to conversion to Christianity, and they did not enslave fellow believers. Latin Christianity gradually diminished enslavement of fellow Christians. As Christian Spain sought to retake territory lost to Muslims, the reconquista had implications for their understanding of slavery. Conquered Muslims were enslaved with the justification conversion and acculturation, but Muslim captives were often offered back to their families and communities for cash payments (\"rescate\"). The thirteenth-century code of law, the \"Siete Partidas\" of Alfonso \"the learned\" (1252–1284) specified who could be enslaved: those who were captured in just war; offspring of an enslaved mother; those who voluntarily sold themselves into slavery, and specified slaves' good treatment by their masters. At the time it was generally domestic slavery and was a temporary condition of members of outgroups. As well as the formal parameters for slavery, the \"Siete Partidas\" also makes a value judgment, stating that it \"was the basest and most wretched condition into which anyone could fall because man, who is the freest noble of all God's creatures, becomes thereby in the power of another, who can do with him what he wishes as with any property, whether living or dead.\"\n\nAs the Spanish (Castilians) and Portuguese expanded overseas, they conquered and occupied Atlantic islands off the north coast of Africa, including the Canary Islands as well as São Tomé and Madeira where they introduced plantation sugar cultivation. They considered the indigenous populations there more animal than human, supposedly justifying their enslavement. The Canary Islands came under Castilian control, and by the early sixteenth century the indigenous population had largely been decimated and African slave labor replaced indigenously. Multiple West African states were participants in slave raiding and trading, and the slaves the Castilians purchased were considered legitimate slaves. Slave-trading African states accepted a variety of European goods, including firearms, horses, and other desirable goods in exchange for slaves.\n\nBoth the Spanish and the Portuguese colonized the Atlantic islands off the coast of Africa, where they engaged in sugar cane production following the model of Mediterranean production. The sugar complex consisted of slave labor for cultivation and processing, with the sugar mill (\"ingenio\") and equipment established with significant investor capital. When plantation slavery was established in Spanish America and Brazil, they replicated the elements of the complex in the New World on a much larger scale.\n\nThe Portuguese exploration of the African coast and the division of overseas territories via the Treaty of Tordesillas meant that the African slave trade was held by the Portuguese. However, demand for African slaves as the Spanish established themselves in the Caribbean meant that became part of the Spanish Empire's social mosaic. Black slaves in Spain were overwhelmingly domestic servants, and increasingly became prestigious property for elite Spanish households though at a much smaller scale than the Portuguese. Artisans acquired black slaves and trained them in their trade, increasing the artisans' output.\n\nAnother form of forced labor used in the New World with origins in Spain was the encomienda, on the model of the award of the labor to Christian victors over Muslims during the reconquista. This institution of forced labor was initially employed by the Spaniards in the Canary Islands following their conquest, but the Guanche (Canarian) population precipitously declined. The institution as an institution was much more widespread following the Spanish contact and conquests in Mexico and Peru, but the precedents were set prior to 1492.\n\nPrior to the Spanish colonization of the Americas, slavery was a common institution among some Pre-Columbian indigenous peoples, particularly the Aztecs. The Spanish conquest and settlement in the New World quickly led to large-scale subjugation of indigenous peoples, mainly of the Native Caribbean people, by Columbus on his four voyages. Initially, forced labor represented a means by which the conquistadores mobilized native labor, with disastrous effects on the population. Unlike the Portuguese Crown's support for the slave trade in Africa, \"los Reyes Católicos\" () opposed the enslavement of the native peoples in the newly conquered lands on religious grounds. When Columbus returned with indigenous slaves, they ordered the survivors to be returned to their homelands. In 1512, after pressure from Dominican friars, the Laws of Burgos were introduced to protect the rights of the natives in the New World and secure their freedom. The papal bull \"Sublimus Dei\" of 1537, to which Spain was committed, also officially banned enslavement of indigenous peoples, but it was rescinded a year after its promulgation. \n\nThe other major form of coerced labor in their colonies, the encomienda system, was also abolished, despite the considerable anger this caused in the conquistador group who had expected to hold their grants in perpetuity. It was replaced by the repartimiento system.\n\nAfter passage of the 1542 New Laws, also known as the \"New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of the Indians\", the Spanish greatly restricted the power of the encomienda system, allowed abuse by holders of the labor grants (\"encomenderos\"), and officially abolished the enslavement of the native population. However, indigenous who rebelled against the Spanish could be enslaved, so that following the Mixtón War (1540-42) in northwest Mexico many indigenous slaves were captured and moved elsewhere in Mexico. The statutes of 1573, within the \"Ordinances Concerning Discoveries,\" forbade unauthorized operations against independent Indian peoples. It required appointment of a \"protector de indios\", an ecclesiastical representative who acted as the protector of the Indians and represented them in formal litigation. Later in the 16th century, in the Peru, thousands of indigenous men were forced to hard work as underground miners in the silver mines of Potosí, by means of the continuation of the pre-Hispanic Inca \"mita\" tradition.\n\nKing Philip III inherited a difficult situation in Chile, where the Arauco War raged and the local Mapuche succeeded in razing seven Spanish cities (1598–1604). An estimate by Alonso González de Nájera put the toll at 3000 Spanish settlers killed and 500 Spanish women taken into captivity by Mapuche. In retaliation the proscription against enslaving Indians captured in war was lifted by Philip in 1608. This decree was abused when Spanish settlers in Chiloé Archipelago used it to launch slave raids against groups such as the Chono of northwestern Patagonia who had never been under Spanish rule and never rebelled. The Real Audiencia of Santiago opined in the 1650s that slavery of Mapuches was one of the reasons for constant state of war between the Spanish and the Mapuche. Slavery for Mapuches \"caught in war\" was abolished in 1683 after decades of legal attempts by the Spanish Crown to suppress it.\n\nWhen Spain first enslaved Native Americans on Hispaniola, and then replaced them with captive Africans, it established slave labor as the basis for colonial sugar production. It was believed by Europeans that Africans had developed immunities to European diseases, and would not be as susceptible to fall ill as the Native Americans because they had not been exposed to the pathogens yet. In 1501, Spanish colonists began importing enslaved Africans from the Iberian Peninsula to their Santo Domingo colony on the island of Hispaniola. These first Africans, who had been enslaved in Europe before crossing the Atlantic, may have spoken Spanish and perhaps were even Christians. About 17 of them started in the copper mines, and about a hundred were sent to extract gold. As Old World diseases decimated Caribbean indigenous populations in the first decades of the 1500s, enslaved blacks from Africa (\"bozales\") gradually replaced their labor, but they also mingled and joined in flights to freedom, creating mixed-race maroon communities in all the islands where Europeans had established chattel slavery. \n\nSpanish colonist turned Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas (1484–1566) observed and recorded the effects of enslavement on the Native populations. Initially he sought to protect the indigenous from enslavement by advocating and participating in the African slavetrade. He later argued that enslavement of both indigenous and Africans was wrong, violating their human rights. Las Casas campaigned for protections of the indigenous, especially crown limits on the exploitation of the encomienda, helping to bring about the 1542 New Laws. \n\nIn Spanish Florida and farther north, the first African slaves arrived in 1526 with Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón's establishment of San Miguel de Gualdape on the current Georgia coast.\n\nThey rebelled and lived with indigenous people, destroying the colony in less than 2 months.\nMore slaves arrived in Florida in 1539 with Hernando de Soto, and in the 1565 founding of St. Augustine, Florida.\nNative Americans were also enslaved in Florida by the encomienda system.\n\nBritish slaves escaping to Florida were freed by Carlos II's proclamation November 7, 1693 if the slaves were willing to convert to Catholicism,\n\nand it became a place of refuge for slaves fleeing the British colonies. \n\nIn this early period, enslaved African men were often labor bosses, overseeing indigenous labor. Franciscan Toribio de Benaventa Motolinia (1482-1568), one of the First Twelve Franciscans to arrive in Mexico in 1524, considered blacks the Fourth Plague on Mexican Indians. He wrote \"In the first years these black overseers were so absolute in their maltreatment of the Indians, over-loading them, sending them far from their land and giving them many other tasks that many Indians died because of them and at their hands, which is the worst feature of the situation.\" In Yucatan, there were regulations attempting to prevent blacks presence in indigenous communities. In Mexico City in 1537, a number of blacks were accused of rebellion. They were executed in the main plaza (\"zócalo\") by hanging, an event recorded in an indigenous pictorial and alphabetic manuscript. \n\nDemand for African slaves was high and the slave trade was controlled by the Portuguese, who set up trading posts on the west coast of Africa. Spanish colonists purchased them directly from Portuguese traders, who in turn purchased them from African traders on the Atlantic coast. With the increased dependency on enslaved Africans and with the Spanish crown opposed to enslavement of indigenous, except in the case of rebellion, slavery became associated with race and racial hierarchy, with Europeans hardening their concepts of racial ideologies. These were buttressed by prior ideologies of differentiation as that of the limpieza de sangre (en: purity of blood), which in Spain referred to individuals without the perceived taint of Jewish or Muslim ancestry. However, in Spanish America, purity of blood came to mean a person free of any African ancestry. \n\nIn the vocabulary of the time, each enslaved African who arrived at the Americas was called \"Pieza de Indias\" (en: a piece of the Indies). The crown issued licenses asientos, to merchants to specifically trade slaves, regulating the trade. During the 16th century, the Spanish colonies were the most important customers of the Atlantic slave trade, claiming several thousands in sales, but the Dutch, French and British soon dwarfed these numbers when their demand for enslaved workers began to drive the slave market to unprecedented levels.\n\nSome of the first black people in the Americas were \"Atlantic Creoles\", as the charter generation is described by the American historian Ira Berlin. Mixed-race men of African and Portuguese/Spanish descent, some slaves and others free, sailed with Iberian ships and worked in the ports of Spain and Portugal; some were born in Europe, others in African ports as sons of Portuguese trade workers and African women. African slaves were also taken to Portugal, where they married local women. The mixed-race men often grew up bilingual, making them useful as interpreters in African and Iberian ports.\n\nSome famous black Spanish soldiers in the first stages of the Spanish conquest of America were Juan Valiente and Juan Beltrán in Chile, Juan Garrido (credited with the first harvesting of wheat planted in New Spain) and Sebastián Toral in Mexico, Juan Bardales in Honduras and Panama, and in Peru.\n\nThe first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in the continental United States, an interracial union between a free black woman and a Spanish conquistador, happened in 1565 in the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine, Florida, between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville, and a Castillan soldier.\n\nEstevanico, recorded as a black slave from Morocco, survived the disastrous Narváez expedition from 1527 to 1536 when most of the men died. After the ships, horses, equipment and finally most of the men were lost, with three other survivors, Estevanico spent six years traveling overland from present-day Texas to Sinaloa, and finally reaching the Spanish settlement at Mexico City. He learned several Native American languages in the process. He went on to serve as a well-respected guide. Later, while leading an expedition in what is now New Mexico in search of the Seven Cities of Gold, he was killed in a dispute with the Zuñi local people.\n\nBlack slave populations were extremely low on Cuba and Puerto Rico until the 1760s, when the British took Havana, Cuba, in 1762. After that, the British imported more than 10,000 African slaves to Havana, a number that would have taken 20 years to import on other islands. They used it as a base to supply the Caribbean and the lower Thirteen Colonies. This change is almost directly related to the opening of Spanish slave trade to other powers in the 18th century. Spain and Great Britain made a contract in 1713 by which the British would provide the slaves. The Spanish outlawed its own slave trade of Africans.\n\nWhile historians have studied the production of sugar on plantations by enslaved workers in nineteenth-century Cuba, they have sometimes overlooked the crucial role of the Spanish state before the 1760s. Cuba ultimately developed two distinct but interrelated sources using enslaved labor, which converged at the end of the eighteenth century. The first of these sectors was urban and was directed in large measure by the needs of the Spanish colonial state, reaching its height in the 1760s. As of 1778, it was reported by Thomas Kitchin that \"about 52,000 slaves\" were being brought from Africa to the West Indies by Europeans, with approximately 4,000 being brought by the Spanish.\n\nThe second sector, which flourished after 1790, was rural and was directed by private slaveholders/planters involved in the production of export agricultural commodities, especially sugar. After 1763, the scale and urgency of defense projects led the state to deploy many of its enslaved workers in ways that were to anticipate the intense work regimes on sugar plantations in the nineteenth century. Another important group of workers enslaved by the Spanish colonial state in the late eighteenth century were the king's laborers, who worked on the city's fortifications.\n\nThe Spanish colonies were late to exploit slave labor in the production of sugarcane, particularly on Cuba. The Spanish colonies in the Caribbean were among the last to abolish slavery. While the British colonies abolished slavery completely by 1834, Spain abolished slavery in Puerto Rico in 1873. On the mainland of Central and South America, Spain ended African slavery in the eighteenth century. Peru was one of the countries that revived the institution for some decades after declaring independence from Spain in the early 19th century.\n\nSince the beginning of the 18th century, Spanish Florida attracted numerous African slaves who escaped from British slavery in the Thirteen Colonies. Since 1623 the official Spanish policy had been that all slaves who touched Spanish soil and asked for refuge could become free Spanish citizens, and would be assisted in establishing their own workshops if they had a trade or given a grant of land to cultivate if they were farmers. In exchange they would be required to convert to Catholicism and serve for a number of years in the Spanish militia. Most were settled in a community called Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, the first settlement of free African's in North America. The enslaved African Francisco Menéndez escaped from South Carolina and traveled to St. Augustine, Florida, where he became the leader of the settlers at Mose and commander of the black militia company there from 1726 until sometime after 1742.\n\nThe former slaves also found refuge among the Creek and Seminole, Native Americans who had established settlements in Florida at the invitation of the Spanish government. In 1771, Governor John Moultrie wrote to the English Board of Trade, \"It has been a practice for a good while past, for negroes to run away from their Masters, and get into the Indian towns, from whence it proved very difficult to get them back.\" When British government officials pressured the Native Americans to return the fugitive slaves, they replied that they had \"merely given hungry people food, and invited the slaveholders to catch the runaways themselves.\"\n\nAfter the American Revolution, slaves from the State of Georgia and the Low Country escaped to Florida. The U.S. Army led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817–1818 campaign by Andrew Jackson that became known as the First Seminole War. The United States afterwards effectively controlled East Florida. According to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, the US had to take action there because Florida had become \"a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them.\". Spain requested British intervention, but London declined to assist Spain in the negotiations. Some of President James Monroe's cabinet demanded Jackson's immediate dismissal, but Adams realized that it put the U.S. in a favorable diplomatic position. Adams negotiated very favorable terms.\n\nAs Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or garrisons, the Crown decided to cede the territory to the United States. It accomplished this through the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1819, effective 1821.\n\nSupport for abolitionism rose in Great Britain. Slavery was abolished under the French Revolution, for the French Caribbean colonies, (the slavery was abolished in European part of France in 1315 by Louis X) but was restored under Napoleon I. Slaves in Saint-Domingue established independence, founding the republic of Haiti in 1804.\n\nLater slave revolts were arguably part of the upsurge of liberal and democratic values centered on individual rights and liberties which came in the aftermath of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution in Europe. As emancipation became more of a concrete reality, the slaves' concept of freedom changed. No longer did they seek to overthrow the whites and re-establish carbon-copy African societies as they had done during the earlier rebellions; the vast majority of slaves were creole, native born where they lived, and envisaged their freedom within the established framework of the existing society.\n\nThe Spanish American wars of independence emancipated most of the overseas territories of Spain; in Central and South America, various nations emerged from these wars. The wars were influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and economic affairs, which also led to the reduction and ending of feudalism. It was not a unified process. Some countries, including Peru and Ecuador, reintroduced slavery for some time after achieving independence.\n\nIn the treaty of 1814, the king of Spain promised to consider means for abolishing the slave trade. In the treaty of September 23, 1817, with Great Britain, the Spanish Crown said that \"having never lost sight of a matter so interesting to him and being desirous of hastening the moment of its attainment, he has determined to co-operate with His Britannic Majesty in adopting the cause of humanity.\" The king bound himself \"that the slave trade will be abolished in all the dominions of Spain, May 30, 1820, and that after that date it shall not be lawful for any subject of the crown of Spain to buy slaves or carry on the slave trade upon any part of the coast of Africa.\" The date of final suppression was October 30. The subjects of the king of Spain were forbidden to carry slaves for any one outside the Spanish dominions, or to use the flag to cover such dealings.³\n\nThe Assembly of Year XIII (1813) of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata declared the freedom of wombs. It did not end slavery completely, but emancipated the children of slaves. Many slaves gained emancipation by joining the armies, either against royalists during the War of Independence, or during the later Civil Wars. For example, the Argentine Confederation ended slavery definitely with the sanction of the Argentine Constitution of 1853.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the few foreign-born Chinese citizens of non-Chinese origin to become a member of the Communist Party of China.\n\nIsrael Epstein was born on 20 April 1915 in Warsaw to Jewish parents; at the time, Warsaw was under Imperial Russian control (now the capital of Poland). His father had been imprisoned by the authorities of czarist Russia for leading a labor uprising and his mother had been exiled to Siberia. Epstein's father was sent by his company to Japan after the outbreak of the World War I; when the German Army approached Warsaw, his mother and Epstein fled and joined him in Asia. With his family experiencing anti-Jewish sentiment in several places, in 1917, Epstein came to China with his parents at the age of two and they settled in Tianjin (formerly \"Tientsin\") in 1920.\n\nIsrael Epstein began to work in journalism at age 15, when he wrote for the \"Peking and Tientsin Times\", an English-language newspaper based in Tianjin. He also covered the Japanese Invasion of China for the United Press and other Western news agencies. In the autumn of 1938, he joined the China Defense League, which had been established by Soong Ching-ling, Sun Yat-sen's widow, for the purpose of publicizing and enlisting international support for the Chinese cause. In 1941, he faked news about his own death as a decoy for the Japanese who were trying to arrest him. The misinformation even found its way into a short item printed in the \"New York Times\".\n\nAfter being assigned to review one of the books of Edgar Snow, Epstein and Snow came to know each other personally and Snow showed him his classic work \"Red Star Over China\" before it was published.\n\nIn 1934, Epstein married Edith Bihovsky Epstein, later Ballin, from whom he was divorced in the early 1940s. In 1944, Epstein first visited Britain and afterwards went to live in the United States with his second wife Elsie Fairfax-Cholmeley for five years.\n\nHe worked for Allied Labor News and published his book \"The Unfinished Revolution in China\" in 1947. His book was enthusiastically reviewed in \"The New York Times\" by Owen Lattimore of Johns Hopkins University. In 1951 Communist defector Elizabeth Bentley testified to the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, \"Israel Epstein had been a member of the Russian secret police for many years in China.\"\n\nMany years later, his wife, Fairfax-Cholmeley, would become known to a generation of Chinese-language students in China and around the world as a contributor to one of the most widely used Chinese-English dictionaries published in the PRC. After Fairfax-Cholmeley's death in 1984, Epstein married his third wife, Huang Huanbi.\nIn 1951, Soong Ching-ling invited him to return to China to edit the magazine \"China Reconstructs\", which was later renamed \"China Today\". He remained editor-in-chief of \"China Today\" until his retirement at age 70, and stayed on as editor emeritus. During his tenure at \"China Today\", he became a Chinese citizen in 1957 and a member of the Communist Party of China in 1964. In 1955, 1965 and 1976 Epstein visited Tibet, and based on these three visits in 1983 published the book \"Tibet Transformed\".\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, on charges of plotting against Zhou Enlai, he was imprisoned in 1968 in the north of Beijing in Qincheng Prison, where he was subjected to solitary confinement. In 1973, he was released, and Zhou apologized. His privileges were restored. Despite his 5 years imprisonment, he remained loyal to the ideals of Communism until his death. Israel Epstein was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body, in 1983.\n\nDuring his life, Israel Epstein was honored by Chinese political leaders Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. His funeral was held at the Babaoshan Cemetery for Revolutionaries, in Shijingshan District, Beijing on 3 June 2005 at 09:30. The ceremony was attended by many officials, among them President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, as well as Politburo Standing Committee members Jia Qinglin and Li Changchun. After the service, his body was cremated.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Newport News Park shares a long stretch of border with the Colonial National Historical Park and several of the park's biking and hiking trails cross over into the CNHP.\n\nThe mailing address for Newport News Park is 13560 Jefferson Avenue, Newport News VA 23603 USA.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the current park was the site of the Battle of Dam No. 1, part of the Battle of Yorktown (1862). In the days prior to the battle, the Confederate forces constructed rifle pits and other earth works from which they held off the Union Army forces commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. The Lee's Mill Earthworks were preserved; though overgrown with woods, they are accessible from the White Oak nature trail on the camping side of the reservoir.\n\nIn the 1960s, as Newport News grew, the city found itself taxing its water supply. The solution to the problem was to purchase several lakes in the Lee Hall area and pump the water into the city. To protect the cleanliness of the water, a watershed around the new Lee Hall Reservoir was created. The watershed was developed into Newport News Park in 1966, primarily through the efforts of City Manager Joe Biggins, who considered the development of a large park important as the city continued to grow.\n\nNewport News Park offers 188 campsites, ranging from basic sites with no utilities to sites with electrical and water hookups.\n\nThere are over 30 miles (50 km) of trails in the Newport News Park complex. The park has a 5.3 mile (8.5 km) multi-use bike path. The park offers bicycle and helmet rental, and requires helmet use by children under 14.\n\nThe Newport News Park Discovery Center was built to give visitors a look at the park in a more structured, educational way. There are numerous exhibits on the types of natural life in the park, as well as exhibits on the historical aspects of the land. Civil War artifacts found in the park are on display.\n\nNewport News Park also offers an archery range, disc golf course, and an \"aeromodel flying field\" for remote-controlled aircraft, complete with a 400 ft (120 m) runway. The park welcomes geocaching, with dozens of geocaches in the park as of September 2018.\n\n"}

He began recording music as VNV Nation in 1990 and moved to Toronto, Canada later that year. In 1994, Harris moved back to Europe where he soon met up with Mark Jackson, who joined VNV Nation as the drummer for live shows. Since 1995, Harris has released ten studio albums as VNV Nation.\n\nHarris was a co-founder of Dependent Records, but left the label after VNV Nation's \"Futureperfect\" album was released in 2002. Harris now releases VNV Nation's records independently on his Anachron Sounds imprint.\n\nIn 2001, Harris produced the Angels and Agony album \"Eternity.\" He performed vocals for the futurepop supergroup Bruderschaft on their \"Forever\" EP in 2003 and appeared on AFI's 2006 \"Decemberunderground\" album, providing electronic sequences and effects for some of the songs. \n\nIn 2006, Harris founded his new project Modcom, producing instrumental electronic music based entirely on the usage of analog sequencers and synthesizers.\n\nHarris also performs live DJ sets.\n\n\n"}

It runs from Laurier Avenue in the north to Dow's Lake where it turns into Prince of Wales Drive. It is administered and owned by the National Capital Commission (NCC).\n\nThe drive was one of the first projects of the NCC. The NCC replaced the Federal District Commission (FDC), which had been created in 1927, and the even earlier Ottawa Improvement Commission. The two-lane road replaced the industrial buildings and private boathouses that had stood along the canal. The drive was lined with trees and gardens, and a series of large houses were built along it. It was originally known as the Government Driveway but was soon renamed the Rideau Canal Driveway. Several decades later it was given its current name. The speed limit for most of its length is 60 km/h (37 mph).\n\nIn the 1950s a similar route was created on the eastern edge of the canal, the Colonel By Drive.\n\nAlong the entire length of the Drive is a multi-use trail as part of the Capital Pathway system.\n"}

Avicenna's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of hypothetical syllogism, temporal modal logic and inductive logic. Other important developments in early Islamic philosophy include the development of a strict science of citation, the isnad or \"backing\", and the development of a scientific method of open inquiry to disprove claims, the ijtihad, which could be generally applied to many types of questions.\n\nEarly forms of analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning and categorical syllogism were introduced in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century with the process of \"Qiyas\", before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term \"Qiyas\" refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that \"Qiyas\" refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that \"Qiyas\" does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that \"Qiyas\" refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term \"Qiyas\" refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.\n\nThe first original Arabic writings on logic were produced by al-Kindi (Alkindus) (805–873), who produced a summary on earlier logic up to his time. The first writings on logic with non-Aristotelian elements was produced by al-Farabi (Alfarabi) (873–950), who discussed the topics of future contingents, the number and relation of the categories, the relation between logic and grammar, and non-Aristotelian forms of inference. He is also credited for categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being \"idea\" and the second being \"proof\".\n\nAverroes (1126–98) was the last major logician from al-Andalus, who wrote the most elaborate commentaries on Aristotelian logic.\n\nAvicenna (980-1037) developed his own system of logic known as \"Avicennian logic\" as an alternative to Aristotelian logic. By the 12th century, Avicennian logic had replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world.\n\nThe first criticisms of Aristotelian logic were written by Avicenna, who produced independent treatises on logic rather than commentaries. He criticized the logical school of Baghdad for their devotion to Aristotle at the time. He investigated the theory of definition and classification and the quantification of the predicates of categorical propositions, and developed an original theory on \"temporal modal\" syllogism. Its premises included modifiers such as \"at all times\", \"at most times\", and \"at some time\".\n\nWhile Avicenna often relied on deductive reasoning in philosophy, he used a different approach in medicine. Avicenna contributed inventively to the development of inductive logic, which he used to pioneer the idea of a syndrome. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation which are critical to inductive logic and the scientific method.\n\nIbn Hazm (994-1064) wrote the \"Scope of Logic\", in which he stressed on the importance of sense perception as a source of knowledge. Al-Ghazali (Algazel) (1058–1111) had an important influence on the use of logic in theology, making use of Avicennian logic in Kalam. Despite the logical sophistication of al-Ghazali, the rise of the Ash'ari school from the 12th century slowly suffocated original work on logic in much of the Islamic world, though logic continued to be studied in some Islamic regions such as Persia and the Levant.\n\nFakhr al-Din al-Razi (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's \"first figure\" and developed a form of inductive logic, foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by John Stuart Mill (1806–1873). Systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the Illuminationist school, founded by Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who developed the idea of \"decisive necessity\", an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation. Another systematic refutation of Greek logic was written by Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328), the \"Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin\" (\"Refutation of Greek Logicians\"), where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the syllogism and in favour of inductive reasoning.\n\n\n\n"}

It connected Frankwell, an old suburb of the town, to the town centre via Mardol. The gate on the town side was called \"Mardol Gate\" and is located where the Mardol Quay Gardens are. The gate on the other side was called \"Welsh Gate\" or \"St George's Gate\". The bridge, sometimes now known as the Old Welsh Bridge, was demolished in 1795 and was replaced with the Welsh Bridge.\n\nThe bridge's date of construction is believed to have been about 1262. In 1539 John Leland described it as follows:\n\n... the greatest, fayrest and highest upon the streame is the Welsh Bridge having 6 great Arches of Stone, soe called because it is the Way out of the Towne into Walles. This Bridge standeth on the West Syde of the Towne, and hath at the one End of it a great Gate to enter by into the Towne, and at the other End towardes Wales a might strong Towre to prohibit Enimies to enter into the Bridge.\n\nThe bridge was variously described as \"Walshebrugge\" (in 1336), and \"Walshemanne's brigge\" (in 1351). A public convenience was built on it in about 1496 . One span was a timber drawbridge, while several shops had been built near the middle of the bridge. It is recorded that one tower was still in existence until late in the bridge's life. Above the main tower was a statue of Richard Plantagenet, removed in 1791.\n\nThe Welsh Bridge however was built about 80 yards (73m) further downstream, connecting Barker Street (at what was \"Cripple Lode Gate\") with Frankwell. This bridge remains to the day and still carries traffic over the Severn. The section of Barker Street which is on the bridge end has been called Bridge Street since the building of the new bridge.\n\nIn 2004, the council installed an information board about the history of the bridge and Mardol, at the bottom of Mardol on the approach to the site of the bridge. Only one dry arch of the old St George's Bridge now remains, on the Frankwell side. The arch was excavated during the construction of Theatre Severn in the late 2000s and is preserved within its foundations.\n\nSaint George is the patron saint of England. It is also given to the (CofE) church in Frankwell, which is within walking distance of the Welsh Bridge/site of St George's Bridge.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1978150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978150", "title": "Bully Hayes", "text": "Bully Hayes\n\nWilliam Henry \"Bully\" Hayes (1827 or 1829 – 31 March 1877) was a notorious American-born ship's captain who engaged in blackbirding in the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nHayes operated across the breadth of the Pacific in the 1850s until his murder on 31 March 1877. Hayes has been described as a South Sea pirate and \"the last of the buccaneers\". However James A. Michener and A. Grove Day, in their account of his life, warn that it is almost impossible to separate fact from legend in his life; they described Hayes as \"a cheap swindler, a bully, a minor confidence man, a thief, a ready bigamist\" and commented that there is no evidence that Hayes ever took a ship by force in the tradition of a pirate or privateer.\n\nHe was a large man who used intimidation against his crew, although he could be very charming if he chose to be.\n\nHe was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one of three sons of Henry Hayes, a grog-shanty keeper. Hayes became a sailor on the Great Lakes after running away from home. He is believed to have left New York as a passenger of the \"Canton\" on 4 March 1853, although when the ship reached Singapore on 11 July 1853 it was captained by Hayes, and sold by him there shortly after arrival. Hayes operated in East Asia, carrying out various frauds on ship's chandlers over mortgaging ships, providing forged papers in payment for cargo and selling cargo for his own account rather than for the account of the owners of the cargo.\n\nHayes arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia in January 1857 as captain of the \"C. W. Bradley, Jr.\" (which was the \"Canton\", repurchased and renamed). The \"Bradley\" had excellent cabin accommodation, and made two trips to Adelaide; in March and June 1857 with passengers. The South Australian authorities were not pleased as many of these migrants were convicts with conditional pardons. The Singapore ships chandlers caught up with Hayes in Perth, Australia and forced the sale of his ship, bankrupting him. The \"Bradley\" was sold in Adelaide on 22 July and was later renamed \"Federation\".\n\nHayes married the widow Amelia Littleton in the Clare Valley town of Penwortham on 20 August 1857, bigamously if, as is believed, Hayes had earlier married in the United States.\n\nHayes had built up debts in Adelaide, but by a ruse escaped his creditors and in Melbourne, Australia he gained the command of the \"Orestes\" sailing to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Hayes was thrown off the ship in Honolulu by the supercargo for swindling passengers. He proceeded to gain command of a new ship, the 318-ton brig \"Ellenita\" with a cargo obtained by fraud. Hayes sailed back across the Pacific, abandoning Amelia in San Francisco. Another version has her falling from the \"Orestes\" in 1858 and drowning. On the return trip to Sydney, Hayes lost the \"Ellenita\" off Navigator Islands on 16 October 1859 and with the women and children and a skeleton crew reached Savai'i to raise the alarm. After considerable difficulties, the remaining passengers and crew were returned to Sydney by H.M. brig \"Elk\". There Hayes evaded a charge of having indecently assaulted one of the passengers, Miss Cornelia Murray, aged 15.\n\nWhile Hayes lost the \"Ellenita\" in a storm, and others to creditors, he always found new ships to command and new cargoes to fraudulently acquire and sell. Between maritime adventures Hayes became a member of a blackface minstrel troupe in New South Wales, Australia.\n\nHayes was a notable early figure in the history of the Otago region of New Zealand. After facing bankruptcy in Australia in the late 1850s, he sailed to Otago in 1862 (at the time the region was the center of a gold rush). He travelled the region with a travelling company of vaudeville artists on a tour of New Zealand. In January 1863 they arrived at Arrowtown. Hayes married a widow Mrs Roma 'Rosie' Buckingham, whose four sons were vaudeville artists, performing as \"The Masters Buckingham\". Hayes and Roma settled in Arrowtown where he opened a hotel, the \"United States\", later called \"The Prince of Wales\".\n\nHayes had a falling out with the Buckingham family who offered any barber £5 to cut his hair off short. Eventually this happened and it was revealed, as rumoured, that Hayes had been deprived of an ear in California where he had been caught cheating at cards. After this he was mocked in a popular play, and with his reputation gone he and his wife left for Port Chalmers. Later he acquired a ship in Australia, the \"Black Diamond\" which he hid in Croixelles Harbour, near Nelson. On 19 August 1864, while travelling in a borrowed yacht, the family was caught by a sudden squall and Rosie, her baby, her brother, and a nurse all drowned. Only Hayes survived.\n\nHe moved to Christchurch, where he married Emily Mary Butler in 1865.\n\nIn May 1866 Hayes acquired the brig \"Rona\" and operated in the Pacific with bases in Apia, Samoa, and in Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Hayes became notorious in the Pacific because of his \"recruiting\" of Pacific islanders to provide labour for the plantations of Tahiti, Fiji, Samoa and Australia. While there was some voluntary recruitment of Pacific islanders, the activity predominantly involved kidnapping, coercion and tricks to entice islanders onto ships, on which they were held prisoner until delivered to their destination.\n\nHayes made money and purchased the brigantine \"Samoa\". By coincidence Hayes lost both ships off Manihiki, Cook Islands in March 1869. Hayes then purchased the schooner \"Atlantic\", although soon after he was arrested in February 1870 by the Consul Williams in Apia on charges related to his activities. Hayes escaped from Samoa on 1 April 1870 on the ship of Ben Pease, a fellow American of similar reputation.\n\nThere are differing accounts of the adventures of Hayes and Pease. That of James A. Michener and A. Grove Day Hayes is different in detail to that provided by Alfred Restieaux, an island trader who had dealings with both Hayes and Pease. What is consistent between the accounts is that Hayes and Pease proceeded on a trading cruise in the Caroline Islands and the Marshall Islands in the 250-ton brig \"Pioneer\". According to Restieaux, Hayes and Pease argued over the ownership of the cargo; Hayes claimed the cargo was his and that Pease was merely carrying it as freight, while Pease claimed a half share in the cargo. Restieaux's account is that Hayes sold the cargo in Shanghai; with Restieaux recounting two stories that he had been told about Pease's death: the first was that he drowned after jumping overboard from a Spanish Man-of-War, the second was that he was killed in a fight in the Bonin Islands.\n\nIn any event when the \"Pioneer\" arrived back in Apia Hayes was in sole command with his explanation for this change in command being that Ben Pease had sold the ship to Hayes and had retired to China – an explanation that many doubted but would not or could not challenge.\n\nHayes renamed the ship the \"Leonora\", (the name of his favourite daughter), painting her white in an effort to change her reputation. Hayes continued to trade in coconut oil, copra and blackbirding. Hayes was arrested by Captain Richard Meade of the on 19 February 1872 but was released as Meade could not find witnesses or sufficient proof. Hayes's reputation meant that no crew members would give evidence against him.\n\nHayes had a long history of charges made against him for the sexual assault of underage females. In 1860 he was brought to court in Sydney for the indecent assault of 15 year old Cornelia Murray aboard his ship the \"Ellenita\". In 1865 he tried to abduct a 17-year-old girl in New Zealand. However, the most shocking example was the brutal rape of a nine-year-old girl at Kosrae in 1872. In July of that year, Hayes went to the Micronesian island of Pingelap where he extorted the people to load his ship with 6,000 coconuts and to bring him a young girl. His demands were met and he sailed to his residence at the nearby island of Kosrae. Here it was reported through several verified written accounts that Hayes took the girl ashore and violently raped her. After Hayes had finished with her, the girl was taken back to the ship in severe pain, crying with blood running down her legs. She was still not able to walk properly after three months when she was returned to Pingelap. An inquiry by Captain A.E. Dupuis of HMS \"Rosario\" in 1874 was able to procure evidence against Hayes for this crime but it was never pursued in court. Hayes was known to treat other girls in a similar manner while at Kosrae.\n\nIn 1874, 19-year old Australian Louis Becke sailed a ketch, the \"E.A. Williams\" from Apia, Samoa to Mili Atoll to deliver it to Hayes. Becke then joined the \"Leonora\", as a passenger until it was wrecked on 15 March 1874 during a storm while in Lele harbour at Kosrae. at what is now the Utwe-Walong Marine Park on Kosrae,\n\nAfter the wreck Hayes brawled with the European traders on Kosrae and with his crew, with the islanders being subject to seven months of oppression and violence. Becke chose to stay with the islanders in the village of Leassé. In September of that year under Captain Dupuis arrived and Hayes was arrested, but escaped by a 14-foot boat built of timber from the wreck of the \"Leonora\".\n\nBecke later became an author, and wrote a number of stories of the exploits of Bully Hayes.\n\nHayes reached Guam. He purchased the schooner \"Arabia\" on credit in April 1875 and accepted a commission to help convicts escape from prison. He was arrested and ended up in prison in Manila, Philippines – at the time a colony of Spain. Hayes was eventually freed and landed in San Francisco without funds in early 1876. He persuaded a Mr. and Mrs. Moody to fund the purchase of a schooner the \"Lotus\". Hayes tricked Mr. Moody into going ashore and sailed off with Mrs. Moody still on board. After arriving in Apia, Samoa, on 2 January 1877, the \"Lotus\" sailed to Kosrae, the island on which \"Leonora\" was wrecked, where Hayes intended to collect coconuts left at the time of the wreck.\n\nThe commonly accepted version of the death of Hayes provided by Charles Elson, the mate of the \"Lotus\", was that when leaving Kosrae on 31 March 1877, the ship's cook Peter Radeck, \"Dutch Pete\", responding to threats from Hayes, killed him. While the events are unclear, it is understood that Hayes was shot with a revolver, struck on the skull with an iron implement and thrown overboard. Charles Elson and the remaining crew sailed the \"Lotus\" to Jaluit in the Marshall Islands and gave an account of the death of Bully Hayes. No one was concerned at his death – indeed Peter Radeck was treated as a hero.\n\nBecke's interpretation of the events was that Charles Elson plotted with the other crew members to murder Hayes. The motive was remove Hayes and allow Elson and the crew to search for and take the money that Hayes was believed to have buried on Kosrae following the wreck of the \"Leonora\" in 1874. The existence of this buried money is part of the myth that surrounds Hayes.\n\nBully Hayes may not have ever taken a ship by force in the tradition of a pirate or privateer, acts of fraud having been his preferred means of gaining command of a ship, however if the suspicion that he disposed of Ben Pease to gain command of the \"Pioneer\" is true then he may well have been a murderer.\n\nMuch of his legend is due to the writing of Louis Becke, who used his time with Hayes in his Pacific stories: \nIn some he tells stories of Hayes that are based on first-hand experience, but there may be some fictional elements.\n\nJoan Druett, \"The Notorious Captain Hayes\" Sydney: HarperCollins, 2016'\n\n\n"}

Eads during the American Civil War. (While initially owned by the Army, the City-class gunboats were commanded by U.S. Navy officers, and were eventually transferred to the Navy.)\n\n\"Louisville\" was built at St. Louis, Missouri, by James B. Eads in 1861, under contract with the War Department for the price of $89,000. Designed by U.S. Navy \"Constructor\" (Naval Engineer) Samuel M. Pook, she was accepted 15 January 1862; and commissioned 16 January 1862, Commander Benjamin M. Dove, USN, in command. Despite being designed by naval personnel, budgetary concerns led the War Department to fund construction of \"Louisville\" with Army funds. As such, she was turned over to Army command upon completion and joined the Army's Mississippi River Squadron. Eventually the entire western river flotilla would be transferred to Navy command.\n\n\"Louisville\" assisted the Army in the capture of Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River 14 to 16 February 1862. From 1 to 5 March, she aided in the occupation of Columbus, Kentucky, the \"Gibraltar of the West.\" Departing Cairo, Illinois, 14 March, she served in the capture of Island No. 10 and New Madrid, Missouri, through 7 April, and helped to prevent southern ships from ascending the river.\n\nIn May, \"Louisville\" was ordered to Fort Pillow and participated in the Battle of Memphis 6 June. Commanded by Rear Admiral Charles Henry Davis, her squadron captured and sank the Confederate Mississippi flotilla. On 15 June, she attacked the upper batteries at Vicksburg, before shifting efforts to the White River, departing Helena, Arkansas, 5 August. Escorting and to the mouth of the river, she met little resistance. In late September 1862 she was transferred to the Navy and assigned a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Richard W. Meade.\n\nAfter escorting transport \"Meteor\", disembarking troops at Bledsoe's and Hamblen's landings 21 October, \"Louisville\" returned to Helena to join the gunboat fleet, Mississippi Squadron. She joined , , , , , , , and later in the month on an expedition up the White River in support of Major General William T. Sherman's army. \"Louisville\" captured the steamer \"Evansville\" near Island No. 36 on 1 November.\n\nNow under the command of Lieutenant Elias K. Owen, \"Louisville\" aided in the capture of Fort Hindman, Arkansas Post, 4 to 11 January 1863, and formed part of the expedition through Steele's Bayou, 14 to 28 January. She was ordered to the Yazoo River the 31st and moved to stop Confederates felling trees across the bayou on 21 March. She then turned her attention to the batteries on the river, running past those at Vicksburg on 16 April, and engaging the lower ones on the 29th. She joined , and on that date, silencing the guns of the fort on Grand Gulf and helping to establish the siege which forced Vicksburg's surrender 4 July 1863.\n\nFrom 12 March to 22 May 1864, \"Louisville\" joined in the expedition up the Red River. On 2 June she engaged Confederate batteries seven miles below Columbia, Arkansas, silencing the guns. She landed Union troops at Sunnyside 6 June and anchored off Shipwith's Landing the 20th, to learn that Confederates were traveling upriver with a heavy force, and had crossed Cypress Creek and Bartholomew's Bayou 20 June with cavalry, infantry, and artillery. On learning that Parsson's brigade was 10 miles back of Gaines' Landing, providing reinforcements, \"Louisville\" departed immediately for that point, and helped break up the Confederate attack.\n\n\"Louisville\" continued service on the Mississippi River until decommissioning 21 July 1865. She was sold at public auction at Mound City, Illinois 29 November 1865. Four of her sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for their service in the war: Boatswain's Mate Charles Bradley, Boatswain's Mate James Byrnes, Coxswain Timothy Sullivan, and Captain of the Forecastle William Talbott.\n\nLike many of the Mississippi theatre ironclads, \"Louisville\" had its armament changed multiple times over life of the vessel. To expedite the entrance of \"Louisville\" into service, she and the other City-class ships were fitted with whatever weapons were available; then had their weapons upgraded as new pieces became available. Though the 8-inch Dahlgren smoothbore cannons were fairly modern most of the other original armaments were antiquated; such as the 32-pounders, or modified; such as the 42-pounder \"rifles\" which were in fact, old smoothbores that had been gouged out to give them rifling. These 42-pounder weapons were of particular concern to military commanders because they were structurally weaker and more prone to exploding than purpose built rifled cannons. Additionally, the close confines of riverine combat greatly increased the threat of boarding parties. The 12-pounder howitzer was equipped to address that concern and was not used in regular combat.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1978155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978155", "title": "Diplom", "text": "Diplom\n\nA Diplom (, from \"diploma\") is an academic degree in the German-speaking countries Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and a similarly named degree in some other European countries including Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine and only for engineers in France, Greece, Hungary, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, and Brazil.\n\nThe Diplom originates from the French Diplôme (\"Diplôme de l'ordre impérial de la légion d'honneur\") describing a certificate devised during the Second French Empire to bestow honours upon outstanding citizens and soldiers of the imperial French army to promote them into the Legion of Honour since 1862. The Magister degree was the original graduate degree at German-speaking universities. In Germany the Diplom dates back to the pre-republican period: In October 1899 the engineering degree \"Diplom\" was announced by a \"supreme decree\" of the German emperor Wilhelm II in his function as the King of Prussia on the advent of the Centenary of the Prussian Technical College in Berlin. The Diplom was subsequently adopted by the \"Technische Hochschulen\" (\"Institutes of Technology\") which had received university status following this Prussian decree. Later, all German universities adopted the Diplom as their degree in Science or Engineering.\n\nIn East Germany, the Diplom was the only first degree and was also granted in disciplines such as medicine or law, which at West German universities were completed with a Staatsexamen. Nowadays such diploms are still granted to students of such disciplines, although most universities only grant the diplom status (for example \"Diplom-Jurist\" in law) on request. Some universities also grant a master's degree (e.g. \"Magister iuris\") to such students on request.\n\nWith the implementation of the Bologna process, awarding new \"Diplom\" and \"Magister\" degrees has become rare, since they are replaced by bachelor's or master's degrees. Already awarded degrees remain valid.\n\n'Diplôme' is the French word for degree or diploma. The French engineering diploma is called Diplôme d'Ingénieur (often abbreviated as \"Dipl. Ing.\"). The French government also grants to all holders of a Diplôme d'Ingénieur the academic title of \"Ingénieur Diplômé\", which is official and legally protected in France.\n\nBefore the introduction of the bachelor's and master's degrees in Germany, the standard Science, Engineering or Business degree was the \"Diplom\" and could be, in several variations, obtained at several types of institutes of higher education.\n\nObtained at a university, the degree was simply called a \"Diplom\" or rarely a \"Diplom (Univ.)\" and took usually between four and six years (240–360 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System credits), depending on subject and curriculum. When obtained at a so-called University of Applied Sciences (or \"Fachhochschule\"), the diploma degree is called a \"Diplom (FH)\" and took mostly four years (240 ECTS credits).\n\nThe \"Diplom\" was usually awarded in the natural sciences, business and engineering, while students of humanities, arts and languages finished with a Magister. (The degree in social sciences differed from university to university.) All kinds of \"Diplom\" degrees were usually first degrees. However, the \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" was also the highest non-doctoral degree in science, business or engineering in Germany.\n\nThe duration of the \"Diplom\" degree programmes differed depending on subject and university. An official average duration (\"Regelstudienzeit\") was set by law in each German state, usually being four years for a \"Diplom (FH)\" and 4, 4.5 or 5 years for a \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\". In exceptional cases, universities were allowed to set longer average durations for certain subjects (HGRP1995 § 26 (3), NHG2007 § 6 (3), HmbHG2001 §53 (3)). However, due to the curriculum set by most universities in Germany, the 4, 4.5 or 5 years for a \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" were often exceeded.\nAlthough being a first degree, because of its actual duration, the \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" was and is in Germany not considered as an equivalent to a bachelor's but rather to a master's degree, as also expressed by the equivalent ECTS credits for the \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\".\n\nA holder of a \"Diplom\" obtained at a university is, depending on subject, for example referred to as \"Diplom-Ingenieur\" (\"Diplom-Engineer\"), \"Diplom-Kaufmann\" (\"Diplom-Merchant\"), \"Diplom-Biologe\" (\"Diplom-Biologist\") and so on. In Bavaria, sometimes the postfix \"(Univ.)\" is added. If the Diplom has been obtained at a University of Applied Sciences (\"Fachhochschule\") the postfix \"(FH)\" has to be added (e.g. \"Diplom-Ingenieur (FH)\"). There are a few rare exceptions where the postfix need not be added, mostly due to older laws, small differences in the laws of the German states or transition rules. Transition rules, for example in engineering, or European Union directives like directive 2005/36/EC grant certain limited groups with other kinds of related qualifications to also use the designation \"Diplom\".\n\nTo obtain a Diplom at a university, students had to complete two separate periods of study. The first one was a two-year period of coursework in courses of mainly (but not only) introductory nature, the \"Grundstudium\" (meaning \"basic studying period\"). After (and during) this period, in addition to exams for passing the modules, students attained a series of usually four intermediate exams to obtain the \"Vordiplom\" (meaning \"pre-diploma\").\nThe second period, the \"Hauptstudium\" (meaning \"main period of study\"), consisted of two years of coursework in courses of advanced level, an additional period of several months in which a thesis had to be written and eventually a series of usually four final exams. It was not unusual for students to need more than two years for the coursework of the \"Hauptstudium\". An obtained \"Vordiplom\" and the completion of the coursework of the \"Hauptstudium\" were the requirements to register for working on the thesis and for the final exams. However, access to courses of the \"Hauptstudium\" was usually not restricted to students who had already obtained the \"Vordiplom\". The extent of the final exams and the exams to obtain the \"Vordiplom\" was set by each university individually in its regulations. Normally, the content of two different modules of the preceding period of coursework was examined in each of the examinations, which could be oral or less often in writing. Most students needed approximately six months to complete the final exam period.\n\nThe thesis which followed an independent (although supervised) research project had officially to be completed in not more than 3 to 9 months (depending on subject and university). However, the actual time students worked on these projects could again exceed the official duration by several months.\n\nThe curriculum for a \"Diplom (FH)\" degree, obtained at a University of Applied Sciences (\"Fachhochschule\") used to be more application-oriented, in comparison to what was expected for a Univ. Diplom degree. The programme was slightly shorter and often one semester was spent by the students doing an internship. Those with some previous vocational qualification in a subject related to their studies were typically exempt from the requirement to do an internship. Typically, the studies in such a program were more organized and structured than the studies at a university, with a tighter schedule and a larger number of intermediate and final exams. Subjects were split into those regarded as basic studies and in-depth studies. Unlike the universities the period of basic studies (\"Grundstudium\") wasn't completely separated from the period of in-depth studies (\"Fachstudium\") by a \"pre-diploma\". Instead of a pre-diploma the passing of one or more intermediate exams in a subject qualified to move forward with that particular subject or start related in-depth subject studies. Passing one or more final exams in a subject completed a subject. Once almost all subjects were completed thesis work could start, but the missing final exams had to be passed latest with the completion of the thesis work. It was typical to perform thesis work in the industry, supervised by a professor from the university of applied science and a senior professional from the company where the work was performed. Although lab work was also permitted as thesis work. The written thesis work needed to be defended in an oral exam after which the diploma was granted.\n\nThe \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" is usually a prerequisite for preparing a doctorate (\"Doktorarbeit\"). However, under certain conditions, holders of a \"Diplom (FH)\" are also eligible for doctoral studies. In German-speaking countries and in countries which Germany has bilateral agreements with—regarding the recognition of academic qualifications, the \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" is usually accepted as admission into doctorate programs.\n\nWhile the \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" and the \"Diplom (FH)\" were the most common Diplom degrees in Germany, further Diploma did and do exist. Those are:\n\nIn the German language the word \"Diplom\" can also be used for certificates of any kind of achievement. It is usually apparent from the context if an academic degree is meant or not, especially when the word is combined with the academic profession.\n\nAcceptance of the \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" and the \"Diplom (FH)\" varies from country to country and from university to university. Usually holders of any of the degrees are considered for admission to postgraduate (not necessarily doctoral) studies. The acceptance or rejection of the diploma not only varies because of different academic standards, but also because of political, regulatory and administrative reasons.\n\nThe variations in the acceptance of degrees was one reason the EU initiated and executed the Bologna Process. Part of the Bologna Process shall ensure comparability between higher-education qualifications in the EU. As part of this process Germany has introduced Masters and bachelor's degrees and has largely phased out the awarding of new diploma degrees. A process not universally welcomed by the German academic and engineering communities.\n\nThe already awarded \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" and the \"Diplom (FH)\" degrees remain valid indefinitely and are not exchanged for master's or bachelor's degrees. Current German binding recommendations state that the newly German master's and bachelor's degrees come with the same eligibilities as the old degrees \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" and \"Diplom (FH)\", respectively. This is, for example, important for joining certain career paths in government administration, military, or regulated professions, where some kind of diploma was required. It also implies that \"Diplom (FH)\" holders can join a master's degree program. It does not imply the degrees are the same, a fact stretched multiple times in the cited reference.\n\nAn actual comparison, in case it is needed, is done via ECTS points which are retroactively calculated/assigned to old \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" and \"Diplom (FH)\" degrees, when needed. This calculation is e.g. done when a holder of a \"Diploma (FH)\" wants to join a Masters program and needs to know the number of additional ECTS point to study for to obtain a Masters.\n\nSince the old diploma study programs were all a bit different there is not a single ECTS value or comparison chart for all kinds of diplomas. Almost universally, however, when retroactively calculating ECTS points for \"Diplom / Diplom (Univ.)\" degrees they end up well into the ECTS point range for a master's degree. The situation is different for \"Diplom (FH)\" degrees. Those tend to end up at least at the Bachelor's ECTS point level or above, and below the ECTS point level for a master's degree. The ranking is roughly shown in the following table, from lowest to highest rank. Typical ECTS points are provided for a very rough comparison, individual points vary.\n\nThe following chart illustrates the durations required to obtain the old degrees (\"Diplom, Diplom (FH)\") and the new European degrees (bachelor's and master's), using nominal example durations.\n\nAt the time of the Bologna process, schools in most German states started changing from 13 school years to 12 years. (An exception are the states of Saxony and Thuringia, where Gymnasium has always lasted only 12 years ever since the German Reunification.) Most of the students going for a \"Diplom\" therefore spent 13 years in school before starting their university studies, while the younger Bachelor students nowadays may start one year earlier. (However, in some states, such as Rhineland-Palatinate or Schleswig-Holstein, the first class which completes school after 12 years will graduate as late as 2016.) Regarding international comparison, one may argue that British, Irish and French high school students have school also in the afternoons which could compensate with the (former) additional year of school attendance in Germany.\nNote: For the Diplom (FH) a student has to spend one to two obligatory semesters during his studies in a company. These semesters are included in the table. The study time is therefore one to two semesters shorter. Bachelor studies have them included in the table too. For the Diplom (Universität) those semesters are sometimes not included in the table.\n\nAlso note: In Germany, a Diplom (Universität) student can enter a doctoral program directly (if the student meets the admission requirements). A Diplom (FH) student has to have excellent grades to directly enter a doctorate program. With the Higher Education Act of the Land Lower Saxony as of August 2010, outstanding Bachelor graduates can commence their doctorate at the universities of this German state. In addition, a few German graduate schools, such as the Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science or the Berlin Mathematical School also admit students with a bachelor's degree and excellent grades to their doctorate programmes.\n\nThe Austrian diploma curriculum is a first degree usually structured into 2–3 phases comprising a total of 240–360 ECTS credits (nominally 4–6 years). It typically ends with a final examination after submitting a \"Diplomarbeit\" (diploma thesis).\n\nDepending on the subject, the degrees granted are either Magister/Magistra with a specific suffix (such as Magister philosophiae for philosophy), or Diplom-Ingenieur (in engineering). Notable exceptions are the diploma studies of dentistry and medicine, which result in the degree Doctor medicinae universae (Dr. med. univ.) or Doctor medicinae dentalis (Dr. med. dent.)\n\nIn most subjects, diplom programmes have already been phased out in favour of separate, Bologna-style Bachelor and Master programmes. However, the degree Diplom-Ingenieur is still used for Master's graduates in engineering.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Diplom (German) or Diplôme (French) was the typical first degree at the two federal institutes of technology and at the Swiss universities of applied sciences. Since 2004, these Swiss degrees are no longer offered since they are replaced by Bologna style bachelor's and master's degrees.\n\nIn Finland, the old diplomi-insinööri (\"diploma engineer\") title was completely replaced by Master of Science (Technology) in the Bologna process. All Finnish academic degrees are awarded both in Finnish and English and therefore the title is still awarded as \"diplomi-insinööri\" with \"Master of Science (Technology)\" as the official translation. Conversion was straightforward and academic credits were transformed linearly. \n\nIn Greece, a \"higher education diploma\" (δίπλωμα/πτυχίο ανώτατης εκπαίδευσης) is a 4 to 5-year (8-10 semester) (240 ISCED 6 - 300 ECTS ISCED 7) degree, 5-year Diplomas formatted similarly to the German Diplom(Uni), awarded to students of the Greek Engineering Schools and Departments (called Polytechnic in Greece – not to be confused though with the polytechnics of the UK), with the only exception of \"higher education diploma\" (δίπλωμα/πτυχίο ανώτατης εκπαίδευσης) 4-year (8 semester) (240 ISCED 6) newfly founded University of Western Attica.\n\nWhile every institution has its own individual approaches, the curriculum usually consists of general knowledge and essential background subjects in the first five semesters. After the end of the fifth semester, students select their academic area of interest and pursue a set of specialised courses for the next four semesters. The last semester is devoted to the preparation of a thesis on the student's chosen area of interest, which is presented before a three-member panel.\n\n5 - year Diplomas are considered equivalent to integrated master's degrees. The holder of a diploma in engineering is permitted to sit in the Technical Chamber of Greece exams without any prerequisite. It also allows the engineer to be considered for doctorate studies without taking any additional classes.\n\nSince adoption of the 2001 Higher Education Reform Act (Ν. 2916/2001, Ν. 3549/2007, N. 4009/2011) the Technological Educational Institutes (Τεχνολογικά Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα – TEI) constitute a parallel part of public higher education in Greece. They confer \"higher education diploma\" (δίπλωμα/πτυχίο ανώτατης εκπαίδευσης), a 4-year (8 semester) bachelor's degree formatted similarly to the German Diplom (FH) (240 ECTS – ISCED 6).\n\nGrades range between 0 and 10, 5 being the passing mark. However, since grading practice differs amongst awarding institutions, a descriptive mark is used, which is more or less universal throughout Greece. For example, in the National Technical University of Athens, a grade in the diploma between 5 and 6.99 is \"good\" (καλώς), a grade between 7.00 and 8.99 is \"very good\" (λίαν καλώς) and a grade of 9.00 or more is \"excellent\" (άριστα). In the University of Patras the ranges are from 5 to 6.49 (good), from 6.5 to 8.49 (very good) and from 8.5 to 10 (excellent).\n\n"}

{"id": "1978171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978171", "title": "Christopher Saxton", "text": "Christopher Saxton\n\nChristopher Saxton (c. 1540 – c. 1610) was an English cartographer who produced the first county maps of England and Wales.\n\nSaxton was probably born in Sowood, Ossett in the parish of Dewsbury, in the West Riding of Yorkshire in either 1542 or 1544. His family subsequently moved to the hamlet of Dunningley near Tingley in the parish of Woodkirk where the Saxton name is recorded in 1567. It is speculated that Saxton may have attended the predecessor school to Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield and also speculated that he was a student at Cambridge University but neither is corroborated. It is most likely that John Rudd, the vicar of Dewsbury and Thornhill, a keen cartographer passed his skills to Saxton.\n\nSaxton married and had three children. Robert, born in 1585, was his father's assistant in 1601 and drew a map of Snapethorpe in Wakefield when it was surveyed by his father. Robert was commissioned to survey Sandal Magna in 1607. Christopher Saxton died in either 1610 or 1611.\n\nMap making became increasingly common in the reign of Elizabeth I made possible by advances in surveying technology and printing from engraved copper plates. Accurate mapping of the whole country became increasingly important. Lord Burghley was instrumental in ensuring that a court official, Thomas Seckford of Woodbridge, Suffolk, financed the commission. In 1574 Saxton began the survey of England. In consideration of the expenses involved, Queen Elizabeth granted him a lease on lands at Grigstone Manor in Suffolk. The Welsh survey began in 1577. Surveying the country was a significant undertaking but the first plates were engraved by 1574 and in 1578 the survey was complete. As the task was finished in a short timespan it is possible that Saxton used some of John Rudd's earlier work. Individual county sheets were issued before the completed survey was issued as an atlas in 1579. The proofs were presented to Lord Burghley who compiled them into an atlas of his own.\n\nThe maps were produced in the \"Atlas of the Counties of England and Wales\" published in 1579, the first atlas of any country. It contained 35 maps, each bearing the arms of Elizabeth I and Thomas Seckford, Saxton's patron. The maps show hills and mountains but do not provide precise information as to their location or altitude. A variety of symbols show buildings and settlements. All the maps are dated except for Northumberland. Five counties, Cornwall, Essex, Hertfordshire, The Suffolk and Norfolk maps show the division into hundreds. The atlas was a commercial success, prompting other cartographers including John Speed, John Norton, and Michael Drayton to attempt similar enterprises, adding to and adapting Saxton's work.\n\nThe maps drawn by Saxton were engraved by Augustine Ryther, Remigius Hogenberg, William Hole, William Kip, Leonard Terwoort of Antwerp, Nicholas Reynold of London, Cornelius Hogius, and Francis Scatter. The engravers were of Dutch or Flemish origin. There is no evidence on the maps that Saxton engraved them himself, but according to one account, he engraved those of the Welsh counties and Herefordshire. Saxton obtained a licence to sell the maps for a term of ten years.\n\nJohn Dee, warden of the Manchester's collegiate church, employed Saxton to survey Manchester's parish boundaries in 1596 but no copy has survived. Chetham's Library in Manchester has a copy of the atlas, as does the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Powell was also a four-time finalist for the Tewaaraton Trophy, the lacrosse equivalent of the Heisman Trophy, and is one of two male players to win the award twice. He led Syracuse to two national championships and holds the school record for most career points.\n\nPowell attended Carthage Senior High School in Carthage, New York, where he was a high school All-American. He set the New York State high school records for most points in a season with 194 points in 2000, most points in a game with 15 points in 2000, and most assists in a season with 120 assists in 1999 and 115 in 2000.\n\nPowell enrolled at Syracuse in the fall of 2000 as one of the most anticipated recruits in college lacrosse history. He wore the #22 Syracuse jersey, the same number previously worn by both of his older brothers Casey Powell and Ryan Powell, and by lacrosse legends Gary Gait and Charlie Lockwood.\n\nIn his freshman season, Powell tallied 30 goals, 40 assists (70 points), and 69 groundballs while leading Syracuse to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship title game against Princeton University. In the championship game, he scored an unassisted goal with just 16 seconds remaining in regulation to force overtime, but Syracuse lost to Princeton on a B.J. Prager goal with 41 seconds left in overtime. Powell became the first player in Syracuse lacrosse history to be named a First Team All-American as a freshman. He was also awarded the Jack Turnbull Award as the nation's top attackman, and was a finalist for the inaugural Tewaaraton Trophy.\n\nIn 2002, Powell scored 42 goals and 42 assists en route to leading Syracuse to a national championship. With four goals and three assists in the championship game, he was named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player and won his first Tewaaraton Trophy.\n\nPowell missed the fall 2002 semester and fall practice at Syracuse but was able to regain academic eligibility before the 2003 lacrosse season. Scored 31 goals and 33 assists for 64 points. Despite the aggressive defenses that targeted him during the season, he helped lead Syracuse to the Final Four, of what would eventually be 22 consecutive Final Fours, an NCAA records. Syracuse fell to Johns Hopkins University 19-8 in the semifinals.\n\nAs a senior, Powell led the Orangemen to their ninth NCAA championship. In the NCAA tournament, Syracuse defeated top-seeded Johns Hopkins in the semifinal round 15-9 and then beat second-seeded Navy in the championship game 14-13. On the season, Powell scored 89 points (47 goals, 42 assists), surpassing the Syracuse record shared by his two older brothers to become the all-time leading scorer at Syracuse with 307 points. That number ties him for 12th all-time in NCAA history. Powell was again selected as a First Team All-American, becoming just the sixth lacrosse player to earn that recognition four times, won his second Tewaaraton Trophy, and his first Enners Trophy as the most outstanding player in men's college lacrosse.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Powell surprised many in the lacrosse community when he chose not to play professional lacrosse for Major League Lacrosse in the 2004 season. Instead, he pursued a career as a professional musician. Powell, along with his two older brothers, also signed an endorsement contract with lacrosse equipment manufacturer Brine, Corp., with Mike working out of Brine's west coast office.

{"id": "1978248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978248", "title": "Normans in Ireland", "text": "Normans in Ireland\n\nFrom the 12th century onwards, a group of Normans invaded and settled in Gaelic Ireland. These settlers later became known as Norman Irish or Hiberno-Normans. They originated mainly among Anglo-Norman families from England and Wales, were loyal to the Kingdom of England, and the English state supported their claims to territory in the various realms then comprising Ireland. During the High Middle Ages and Late Middle Ages the Hiberno-Normans constituted a feudal aristocracy and merchant oligarchy, known as the Lordship of Ireland. In Ireland, the Normans were also closely associated with the Gregorian Reform of the Catholic Church in Ireland. Over time the descendants of the 12th-century Norman settlers spread throughout Ireland and around the world, as part of the Irish diaspora; they ceased, in most cases, to identify as Norman or Anglo-Norman.\n\nThe dominance of the Norman Irish declined during the 17th century, after a new English Protestant elite settled in Ireland during the Tudor period. Some of the Norman Irishoften known as The Old Englishhad become Gaelicised by merging culturally and intermarrying with the Gaels, under the denominator of \"Irish Catholic\". Conversely, some Hiberno-Normans assimilated into the new English Protestant elite, as the Anglo-Irish. \n\nSome of the most prominent Norman families were the FitzMaurices, FitzGeralds, Burkes and Butlers. One of the most common Irish surnames, Walsh, derives from the Normans based in Wales who arrived in Ireland as part of this group.\n\nHistorians disagree about what to call the Normans in Ireland at different times in its existence, and in how to define this community's sense of collective identity.\n\nIn his book \"Surnames of Ireland\", Irish historian Edward MacLysaght makes a distinction between Hiberno-Norman and Anglo-Norman surnames. This sums up the fundamental difference between \"Queen's English Rebels\" and the Loyal Lieges. The Geraldines of Desmond or the Burkes of Connacht, for instance, could not accurately be described as Old English, for that was not their political and cultural world. The Butlers of Ormond, on the other hand, could not accurately be described as Hiberno-Norman in their political outlook and alliances, especially after they married into the Royal family.\n\nSome historians now refer to them as Cambro-Normans – Seán Duffy of Trinity College, Dublin, invariably uses that term rather than the misleading Anglo-Norman (most Normans came via Wales, not England) – but after many centuries in Ireland and just a century in Wales or England it appears odd that their entire history since 1169 is known by the description \"Old English\", which only came into use in the late sixteenth century. Some contend it is ahistorical to trace a single Old English community back to 1169, for the real Old English community was a product of the late sixteenth century in the Pale. Up to that time the identity of such people had been much more fluid; it was the administration's policies which created an oppositional and clearly defined Old English community.\n\nBrendan Bradshaw, in his study of the poetry of late-sixteenth century Tír Chónaill, points out that the Normans were not referred to there as \"Seanghaill\" (\"Old Foreigners\") but rather as \"Fionnghaill and Dubhghaill\". He argued in a lecture to the Mícheál Ó Cléirigh Institute in University College, Dublin that the poets referred in that way to hibernicised people of Norman stock in order to grant them a longer vintage in Ireland than the (\"Fionnghaill\" meaning \"fair-haired Foreigners\", i.e. Norwegian Vikings; \"Dubhghaill\" meaning \"black-haired Foreigners\", i.e. Danish Vikings). This follows on from his earlier arguments that the term \"Éireannaigh\" (Irish people) as we currently know it also emerged during this period in the poetry books of the Uí Bhroin of Wicklow, as a sign of unity between Gaeil and Gaill; he viewed it as a sign of an emerging Irish nationalism. Breandán Ó Buachalla essentially agreed with him, Tom Dunne and Tom Bartlett were less sure.\n\nIt was noted in 2011 that Irish nationalist politicians elected between 1918 and 2011 could often be distinguished by surname. Fine Gael parliamentarians were more likely to bear surnames of Norman origin than those from Fianna Fáil, who had a higher concentration of Gaelic surnames.\n\nThe term Old English (, meaning \"old foreigners\") began to be applied by scholars for Norman descended residents of The Pale and Irish towns after the mid-16th century, who became increasingly opposed to the Protestant \"New English\" who arrived in Ireland after the Tudor conquest of Ireland in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many of the Old English were dispossessed in the political and religious conflicts of the 16th and 17th centuries, largely due to their continued adherence to the Roman Catholic religion. As a result, those loyal to Catholicism attempted to replace the distinction between \"Norman\" and \"Gaelic Irish\" under the new denominator of Irish Catholic by 1700, as they were both barred from positions of wealth and power by the so-called New English settlers, who became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.\n\nThe earliest known reference to the term \"Old English\" is in the 1580s The community of Norman descent prior to then used numerous epithets to describe themselves (such as \"Englishmen born in Ireland\" or \"English-Irish\"), but it was only as a result of the political cess crisis of the 1580s that a group identifying itself as the Old English community actually emerged.\n\nTraditionally, London-based Anglo-Norman governments expected the Normans in the Lordship of Ireland to promote the interests of the Kingdom of England, through the use of the English language (despite the fact that they spoke Norman-French rather than English), law, trade, currency, social customs, and farming methods. The Norman community in Ireland was, however, never monolithic. In some areas, especially in the Pale around Dublin, and in relatively urbanised communities in Kilkenny, Limerick, Cork and south Wexford, people spoke the English language (though sometimes in arcane local dialects such as Yola), used English law, and in some respects lived in a manner similar to that found in England.\n\nHowever, in the provinces, the Normans in Ireland ( meaning \"foreigners\") were at times indistinguishable from the surrounding Gaelic lords and chieftains. Dynasties such as the Fitzgeralds, Butlers, and Burkes adopted the native language, legal system, and other customs such as fostering and intermarriage with the Gaelic Irish and the patronage of Irish poetry and music. Such people became regarded as \"more Irish than the Irish themselves\" as a result of this process (see also History of Ireland (1169–1536)). The most accurate name for the community throughout the late medieval period was Hiberno-Norman, a name which captures the distinctive blended culture which this community created and within which it operated. In an effort to halt the ongoing Gaelicisation of the Anglo-Norman community, the Irish Parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367, which among other things banned the use of the Irish language, the wearing of Irish clothes, as well as prohibiting the Gaelic Irish from living within walled towns.\n\nDespite these efforts, by 1515, one official lamented, that \"all the common people of the said half counties\" [of The Pale] \"that obeyeth the King's laws, for the most part be of Irish birth, of Irish habit, and of Irish language.\" English administrators such as Fynes Moryson, writing in the last years of the sixteenth century, shared the latter view of what he termed the \"English-Irish\": \"the English Irish and the very citizens (excepting those of Dublin where the lord deputy resides) though they could speak English as well as we, yet commonly speak Irish among themselves, and were hardly induced by our familiar conversation to speak English with us\". Moryson's views on the cultural fluidity of the so-called \"English Pale\" were echoed by other commentators such as Richard Stanihurst who, while protesting the Englishness of the Palesmen in 1577, opined that \"Irish was universally gaggled in the English Pale\".\nBeyond the Pale, the term 'English', if and when it was applied, referred to a thin layer of landowners and nobility, who ruled over Gaelic Irish freeholders and tenants. The division between the Pale and the rest of Ireland was therefore in reality not rigid or impermeable, but rather one of gradual cultural and economic differences across wide areas. Consequently, the English identity expressed by representatives of the Pale when writing in English to the English Crown often contrasted radically with their cultural affinities and kinship ties to the Gaelic world around them, and this difference between their cultural reality and their expressed identity is a central reason for later Old English support of Roman Catholicism.\n\nThere was no religious division in medieval Ireland, beyond the requirement that English-born prelates should run the Irish church. After the Henrician Reformation of the 1530s, however, most of the pre-16th century inhabitants of Ireland continued their allegiance to Roman Catholicism, even after the establishment of the Anglican Church in England, and its Irish counterpart, the Church of Ireland.\n\nIn contrast to previous English settlers, the \"New English\", that wave of settlers who came to Ireland from England during the Elizabethan era onwards as a result of the Tudor conquest of Ireland, were more self-consciously English, and were largely (though not entirely) Protestant. To the New English, many of the Old English were \"degenerate\", having adopted Irish customs as well as choosing to adhere to Roman Catholicism after the Crown's official split with Rome. The poet Edmund Spenser was one of the chief advocates of this view. He argued in \"A View on the Present State of Ireland\" (1595) that a failure to conquer Ireland fully in the past had led previous generations of English settlers to become corrupted by the native Irish culture. In the course of the 16th century, the religious division had the effect of alienating the Old English from the state, and eventually propelled them into making common cause with the Gaelic Irish as Irish Roman Catholics.\n\nThe first confrontation between the Old English and the English government in Ireland came with the cess crisis of 1556–1583. During that period, the Pale community resisted paying for the English army sent to Ireland to put down a string of revolts which culminated in the Desmond Rebellions (1569–73 and 1579–83). The term \"Old English\" was coined at this time, as the Pale community emphasised their English identity and loyalty to the Crown, while, at the same time, contradictorily they refused to co-operate with the wishes of the English Crown as represented in Ireland by the Lord Deputy of Ireland.\n\nOriginally, the conflict was a civil issue, as the Palesmen objected to paying new taxes that had not first been approved by them in the Parliament of Ireland. The dispute, however, also soon took on a religious dimension, especially after 1570, when Elizabeth I of England was excommunicated by Pope Pius V's papal bull \"Regnans in Excelsis\". In response, Elizabeth banned the Jesuits from her realms as they were seen as being among the Papacy's most radical agents of the Counter Reformation which, among other aims, sought to topple her from her thrones. Rebels such as James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald portrayed their rebellion as a \"Holy War\", and indeed received money and troops from the papal coffers. In the Second Desmond Rebellion (1579–83), a prominent Pale lord, James Eustace, Viscount of Baltinglass, joined the rebels from religious motivation. Before the rebellion was over, several hundred Old English Palesmen had been arrested and sentenced to death, either for outright rebellion, or because they were suspected rebels because of their religious views. Most were eventually pardoned after paying fines of up to 100 pounds, a very large sum for the time. However, twenty landed gentlemen from some of the Pale's leading, Old English families were executed – some of them, \"died in the manner of\" [Roman] \"Catholic martyrs, proclaiming they were suffering for their religious beliefs\".\n\nThis episode marked an important break between the Pale and the English regime in Ireland, and between the Old English and the New English.\n\nIn the subsequent Nine Years' War (1594–1603), the Pale and the Old English towns remained loyal in favour of outward loyalty to the English Crown during another rebellion.\n\nIn the end, however, it was the re-organisation of the English government's administration in Ireland along Protestant lines in the early 17th century that eventually severed the main political ties between the Old English and England itself, particularly following the Gunpowder Plot in 1605.\n\nFirst, in 1609, Roman Catholics were banned from holding public office in Ireland. Then, in 1613, the constituencies of the Irish Parliament were changed so that the New English Anglicans would have a slight majority in the Irish House of Commons. Thirdly, in the 1630s, many members of the Old English landowning class were forced to confirm the ancient title to their land-holdings often in the absence of title deeds, which resulted in some having to pay substantial fines to retain their property, while others ended up losing some or all of their land in this complex legal process (see Plantations of Ireland).\n\nThe political response of the Old English community was to appeal directly to the King of Ireland in England, over the heads of his representatives in Dublin, effectively meaning that they had to appeal to their sovereign in his role as King of England, a necessity which further disgruntled them.\n\nFirst from James I, and then from his son and successor, Charles I, they sought a package of reforms, known as The Graces, which included provisions for religious toleration and civil equality for Roman Catholics in return for their payment of increased taxes. On several occasions in the 1620s and 1630s, however, after they had agreed to pay the higher taxes to the Crown, they found that the Monarch or his Irish viceroy chose instead to defer some of the agreed concessions. This was to prove culturally counterproductive for the cause of the English administration in Ireland, as it led to Old English writers, such as Geoffrey Keating to argue (as Keating did in \"Foras Feasa ar Éirinn\" (1634)), that the true identity of the Old English was now Roman Catholic and Irish, rather than English. English policy thus hastened the assimilation of the Old English with the native Irish.\n\nIn 1641, many of the Old English community made a decisive break with their past as loyal subjects by joining the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Many factors influenced the decision of the Old English to join in the rebellion; among these were fear of the rebels and fear of government reprisals against all Roman Catholics. The main long-term reason was, however, a desire to reverse the anti-Roman Catholic policies that had been pursued by the English authorities over the previous 40 years in carrying out their administration of Ireland. Nevertheless, despite their formation of an Irish government in Confederate Ireland, the Old English identity was still an important division within the Irish Roman Catholic community. During the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–53), the Old English were often accused by the Gaelic Irish of being too ready to sign a treaty with Charles I of England at the expense of the interests of Irish landowners and the Roman Catholic religion. The ensuing Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649–53), saw the ultimate defeat of the Roman Catholic cause and the almost wholesale dispossession of the Old English nobility. While this cause was briefly revived before the Williamite war in Ireland (1689–91), by 1700, the Anglican descendants of the New English had become the dominant class in the country, along with the Old English families (and men of Gaelic origin such as William Conolly) who chose to comply with the new realities by conforming to the Established Church.\n\nIn the course of the eighteenth century under the Protestant Ascendancy, social divisions were defined almost solely in sectarian terms of Roman Catholic, Anglican and Protestant Nonconformist, rather than ethnic ones. Against the backdrop of the Penal Laws (Ireland) which discriminated against them both, and a country becoming increasingly Anglicized, the old distinction between Old English and Gaelic Irish Roman Catholics gradually faded away,\n\nChanging religion, or rather conforming to the State Church, was always an option for any of the King of Ireland's subjects, and an open avenue to inclusion in the officially recognised \"body politic\", and, indeed, many Old English such as Edmund Burke were newly-conforming Anglicans who retained a certain sympathy and understanding for the difficult position of Roman Catholics, as Burke did in his parliamentary career. Others in the gentry such as the Viscounts Dillon and the Lords Dunsany belonged to Old English families who had originally undergone a religious conversion from Rome to Canterbury to save their lands and titles. Some members of the \"Old English\" who had thus gained membership in the Irish Ascendancy even became adherents of the cause of Irish independence. Whereas the Old English FitzGerald Dukes of Leinster held the premier title in the Irish House of Lords when it was abolished in 1800, a scion of that Ascendancy family, the Irish nationalist Lord Edward Fitzgerald, was a brother of the second duke.\n\nThe following is a list of Hiberno-Norman surnames, many of them unique to Ireland. For example, the prefix \"Fitz\" meaning \"son of\", in surnames like FitzGerald appears most frequently in Hiberno-Norman surnames. (cf. modern French \"fils de\" with the same meaning). However, very few names with the prefix \"Fitz-\" sound Norman but are actually of native Gaelic origin; most notably FitzPatrick (from the Mac Giolla Phádraig, kings of Osraige) and FitzDermot (Mac Gilla Mo-Cholmóc, of the Uí Dúnchada sept of the Uí Dúnlainge based at Lyons Hill, Co. Dublin).\n\n\nThe annals of Ireland make a distinction between \"Gaill\" and \"Sasanaigh\". The former were split into \"Fionnghaill\" or \"Dubhghaill\", depending upon how much the poet wished to flatter his patron.\n\nThere are a number of texts in Hiberno-Norman French, most of them administrative (including commercial) or legal, although there are a few literary works as well. There is a large amount of parliamentary legislation, including the famous Statute of Kilkenny and municipal documents.\n\nThe major literary text is \"The Song of Dermot and the Earl\", a chanson de geste of 3,458 lines of verse concerning Dermot McMurrough and Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (known as \"Strongbow\"). Other texts include the \"Walling of New Ross\" composed about 1275, and early 14th century poems about the customs of Waterford.\n\nNormans elsewhere\n"}

() is an American publishing house that was founded by Alfred A. Knopf Sr. and Blanche Knopf in 1915. Blanche and Alfred traveled abroad regularly and were known for publishing European, Asian, and Latin American writers in addition to leading American literary trends. It was acquired by Random House in 1960, and is now part of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group division of Penguin Random House which is owned by the German conglomerate Bertelsmann. The Knopf publishing house is associated with its borzoi colophon, which was designed by co-founder Blanche Knopf in 1925.\n\nKnopf was founded in 1915 by Alfred A. Knopf Sr. along with Blanche Knopf, on a $5,000 advance from his father, Samuel Knopf. The first office was located in New York's Candler Building. The publishing house was officially incorporated in 1918, with Alfred Knopf as president, Blanche Knopf as vice president, and Samuel Knopf as treasurer.\n\nFrom the start, Knopf focused on European translations and high-brow works of literature. Among their initial publications were French author Émile Augier's \"Four Plays\", Ukrainian writer Nikolai Gogol's \"Taras Bulba\", Polish novelist Stanisław Przybyszewski's novel \"Homo Sapiens\", and French writer Guy de Maupassant's \"Yvette, a Novelette, and Ten Other Stories\". During World War I these books were cheap to obtain and helped establish Knopf as an American firm publishing European works. Their first bestseller was a new edition of \"Green Mansions\", a novel by W. H. Hudson which went through nine printings by 1919 and sold over 20,000 copies. Their first original American novel, \"The Three Black Pennys\" by Joseph Hergesheimer, was published in 1917.\n\nWith the start of the 1920s Knopf began using innovative advertising techniques to draw attention to their books and authors. Beginning in 1920, Knopf produced a chapbook, for the purpose of promoting new books. was published periodically over the years, the first being a hardback called the Borzoi and sometimes quarterly as the Borzoi Quarterly. For Floyd Dell's coming-of-age novel, \"Moon-Calf\", they paid men to walk the streets of the financial and theatre districts dressed in artist costumes with sandwich boards. The placards had a copy of the book for browsing and directed interested buyers to local book shops.\n\nThe unique look of their books along with their expertise in advertising their authors drew Willa Cather to leave her previous publisher Houghton Mifflin to join Alfred A. Knopf. As she was still under contract for her novels, the Knopfs suggested publishing a collection of her short stories, \"Youth and the Bright Medusa\" in 1920. Cather was pleased with the results and the advertisement of the book in the New Republic and would go on to publish sixteen books with Knopf including their first Pulitzer prize winner, \"One Of Ours\".\n\nBefore they had married, Alfred had promised Blanche that they would be equal partners in the publishing company, but it was clear by the company's fifth anniversary that this was not to be the case. Knopf published a celebratory 5th anniversary book in which Alfred was the focus of anecdotes by authors and Blanche's name was only mentioned once to note that \"Mrs. Knopf\" had found a manuscript. This despite ample evidence from authors and others that Blanche was in fact the soul of the company. This was covered extensively in \"The Lady with the Borzoi\" by Laura Claridge.\n\nIn 1923 Knopf also started publishing periodicals, beginning with \"The American Mercury\", founded by H. L. Mencken and George Jean Nathan, which it published through 1934.\n\n1923 also marked the year that Knopf published Kahlil Gibran's \"the Prophet\". Knopf had published Gibran's earlier works which had disappointing sales. In its first year, the Prophet only sold 1,159 copies. It would double sales the next year and keep doubling becoming one of the firm's most successful books. In 1965 the book sold 240,000 copies.\n\nSamuel Knopf died in 1932. William A. Koshland joined the company in 1934, and worked with the firm for more than fifty years, rising to take the positions of President and Chairman of the Board. Blanche became President in 1957 when Alfred became Chairman of the Board, and worked steadily for the firm until her death in 1966. Alfred Knopf retired in 1972, becoming chairman emeritus of the firm until his death in 1984. Alfred Knopf also had a summer home in Purchase, New York.\n\nFollowing the Good Neighbor policy, Blanche Knopf visited South America in 1942, so the firm could start producing texts from there. She was one of the first publishers to visit Europe after World War II. Her trips, and those of other editors, brought in new writers from Europe, South America, and Asia. Alfred traveled to Brazil in 1961, which spurred a corresponding interest on his part in South America. Penn Publishing Company was acquired in 1943. The Knopfs' son, Alfred \"Pat\" Jr., was hired on as secretary and trade books manager after the war.\n\nIn 1952, editor Judith Jones joined Knopf as an editor. Jones, who had discovered \"Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl\" while working at Doubleday, acquired Julia Child's \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" for Knopf. Jones would remain with Knopf, retiring in 2011 as a senior editor and vice-president after a career that included working with John Updike and Anne Tyler.\n\nPat Knopf left his parents' publishing company in 1959 to launch his own, Atheneum Publishers, with two other partners. The story made the front page of the New York Times.\n\nIn a 1957 advertisement in the Atlantic Monthly, Alfred A. Knopf published the Borzoi Credo. The credo includes a list of what Knopf's beliefs for publishing including the statement that he never published an unworthy book. Among a list of beliefs listed is the final one--\"I believe that magazines, movies, television, and radio will never replace good books.\"\n\nIn 1960 Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf. It is believed that the decision to sell was prompted by Alfred A. Knopf, Jr., leaving Knopf to found his own book company, Atheneum Books in 1959.\n\nSince its founding, Knopf has paid close attention to design and typography, employing notable designers and typographers including William Addison Dwiggins, Harry Ford, Steven Heller, Chip Kidd, Lorraine Louie, Bruce Rogers, Rudolf Ruzicka, and Beatrice Warde. Knopf books conclude with an unnumbered page titled \"A Note on the Type\", which describes the history of the typeface used for the book. In addition, Knopf books date the year of the book's current printing on the title page.\n\nKnopf published textbooks until 1988, when Random House's schools and colleges division was sold to McGraw-Hill.\n\nIn 1991, Knopf revived the \"Everyman's Library\" series, originally published in England in the early 20th century. This series consists of classics of world literature in affordable hardcover editions. The series has grown over the years to include lines of \"Children's Classics\" and \"Pocket Poets\".\n\nRandom House was acquired by Bertelsmann AG in 1998. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Knopf Publishing Group merged with Doubleday to form the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Random House has been owned since its 2013 merger of Penguin Group by Penguin Random House, a joint venture between Bertelsmann (53%) and Pearson PLC (47%).\n\nMany of Knopf's hardcover books are published later as Vintage paperbacks. Vintage Books is a sister imprint of Random House.\n\nIn October 2012, Bertelsmann entered into talks with rival conglomerate Pearson plc, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Random House and Penguin Group. The merger was completed on 1 July 2013 and the new company is Penguin Random House. Bertelsmann owns 53% of the joint venture while Pearson owns 47%. At the time of the acquisition the combined companies controlled 25% of the book business with more than 10,000 employees and 250 independent publishing imprints and with about $3.9 billion in annual revenues. The move to consolidate was to provide leverage against Amazon.com and battle the shrinking state of bookstores.\n\nIn 2015, Knopf celebrated its 100th Anniversary by publishing a commemorative book, \"Alfred A. Knopf, 1915-2015: A Century of Publishing.\"\n\nWhile there have been many notable editors at Knopf there have only been three editors-in-chief: Alfred A. Knopf, Sr., Robert Gottlieb and Sonny Mehta. Other influential editors at Knopf included Harold Strauss (Japanese literature), Herbert Weinstock (biography of musical composers), Judith Jones (culinary texts), as well as Angus Cameron, Charles Elliott, Gary Fisketjon, Lee Goerner, Ashbel Green, Carol Brown Janeway, Michael Magzis, Anne McCormick, Nancy Nicholas, Daniel Okrent, Regina Ryan, Sophie Wilkins, and Victoria Wilson. Knopf also employed literary scouts to good advantage.\n\nAlfred A. Knopf has published thousands of books from thousands of authors, including Albert Camus, John Banville, Carl Bernstein, Robert Caro, Willa Cather, Julia Child, Bill Clinton, Joan Didion, Bret Easton Ellis, James Ellroy, Martin Gardner, Kahlil Gibran, Lee H.

Silverman, Susan Swan, Anne Tyler, Andrew Vachss, James D. Watson, and Elinor Wylie.\n\nThe logo for Knopf is a Russian wolfhound or Borzoi. Blanche Knopf suggested the Borzoi for the logo to imply motion and the logo was used on both the spine and the title page of their books.\n\n"}
{"id": "1978271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978271", "title": "Mike Haggar", "text": "Mike Haggar\n\n, also known simply as Haggar, is a fictional character in the \"Final Fight\" series of video games. Haggar first appeared in the 1989 Capcom arcade game \"Final Fight\" and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in the \"Saturday Night Slam Masters\" series of video games and various other video game appearances.\n\nHaggar is depicted in the original \"Final Fight\" wearing olive-colored trousers with brown shoes and a brown strap over his right shoulder, which is the usual depiction of the character. Some games deviate slightly from this design. For example, in the \"Slam Masters\" series, he wears green tights with a red trim and brown wrestling boots. By the events of \"Final Fight 3\", he is given a pony-tail hairstyle and wears green bicycle shorts as part of his outfit. Haggar is of Scottish descent, is classically trained in Scottish Backhold folk wrestling, and even keeps a Scottish flag hanging in his gym.\n\nIntroduced as one of the three playable characters in \"Final Fight\", Haggar is a former professional wrestler turned mayor of Metro City, which is plagued by the Mad Gear gang: the most dominant street gang in the city. After he refuses their bribe, they kidnap his daughter Jessica in hopes of forcing Haggar into a reluctant cooperation with them. Haggar recruits the help of Jessica's boyfriend Cody and mutual friend Guy to rescue her and defeat the gang. Haggar later appeared in the sequel games of \"Final Fight\", in which he battles against a revived Mad Gear in \"Final Fight 2\" in order to rescue Guy's girlfriend and sensei, and fighting against the Skull Cross gang in \"Final Fight 3\". He also appears in related titles such as \"Final Fight Revenge\", in which he fights against members of Mad Gear while searching for his missing daughter, and \"Mighty Final Fight\", which happens to be a parody of the original \"Final Fight\". Haggar also appears in \"\" as a retired mayor in charge of a boat repair shop and training gym, offering assistance to Cody's brother Kyle. While not playable in the game's story mode, he can be recruited as a temporary computer controlled ally and is playable in the game's arcade mode. As such, Haggar is the only character to be playable in every \"Final Fight\" game.\n\nBeyond the \"Final Fight\" series, Haggar appears as a playable character in \"Saturday Night Slam Masters\" and its two sequels, \"Muscle Bomber Duo\" and \"Ring of Destruction: Slam Masters 2\". He was also intended to appear in the canceled 3D fighting game \"Capcom Fighting All-Stars\" as a selectable character, reprising his role as mayor to save Metro City from a bomb attack. He also appears as one of several playable characters in the crossover game \"Namco × Capcom\", and as a character card in each of the \"\" titles. Haggar appears as the only playable \"Final Fight\" character in the crossover fighting games \",\" \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3,\" and \"\". Haggar is also an unlockable character in Super Dead Rising 3 Hyper Ex Edition + Alpha, as a reward for finding the Final Fight Arcade Cabinet.\n\nHaggar has also made several cameo appearances such as in Alexs ending sequence for \"Capcom Fighting Evolution\"; in the backgrounds of Guy's \"Final Fight\"-inspired stages in \"Street Fighter Alpha 2\", \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\", and \"Super Street Fighter IV\"; Chun-Lis background in \"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo\"; and with Zangief wearing his clothing as an alternate outfit in \"Street Fighter IV\". Haggar made a brief appearance in one of the 2011 trailers for \"Street Fighter X Tekken\" where he gets beaten by King, and also appears within the game's \"Mad Gear Hideout\" stage, where he arrives during the final round of a match and attacks several Mad Gear members decked in kabuki attire before chasing fellow \"Final Fight\" character Sodom; this same stage reappears in \"Ultra Street Fighter IV\", with Haggar once again making an appearance. In \"Street Fighter V\", Haggar has passed down the mayor position to Cody. Prior to the game's release, the official Street Fighter Twitter page revealed the letter Haggar wrote to Cody as the latter was about to succeed him. Cody also has his clothing as an alternate outfit. In Lucia's story, the now-civilian Haggar goes to Lucia to inform her of rumors about a Mad Gear plot to eliminate Cody, asking her to investigate. Haggar is one of the few prominent character of the \"Final Fight\" series who has never been a playable character in the \"Street Fighter\" series.\n\nHaggar appears in the American \"Street Fighter\" cartoon episode \"Final Fight\". While the plot followed that of the same arcade game, Haggar was unable to act against the Mad Gear gang due to them holding Jessica hostage, and instead recruited the help of Ryu and Ken to rescue her, along with Cody and Guy. He reappears at the conclusion of the episode to be reunited with his daughter shortly before Mad Gear's defeat. Haggar makes occasional appearances in the \"Street Fighter\" comic series. Here, Haggar's backstory has been slightly changed, with the character being portrayed as both a professional wrestler and an action-film star prior to his political career. Haggar also appears as a mayor in the online flash cartoons Weebl and Bob's Team Laser Explosion, and appears as the protagonist in the stop-motion animation \"A Sentinel in Metro City.\"\nHaggar also appears in the \"Final Fight\" fan film \"The Broken Gear\", portrayed by former professional wrestler and MMA fighter Don Frye.\n\nNoted as the star of the \"Final Fight\" series, Haggar has been described as both iconic and one of the most unforgettable characters in gaming history. Haggar was named by \"Gamest\" magazine the best video game character of 1990, placing first in their top fifty characters list and appearing on the issue's cover, and later named the forty-fifth best character of 1993. In 2006, he was cited by \"Retro Gamer\" as one of the heroes of classic video gaming. In August 2009, \"GamesTM\" featured him in their \"Hall of Fame\", describing his character background as \"wonderfully layered\", with his aspects of being a father, a hard-working mayor, and former wrestler giving him \"a sense of humanity\" and \"instantly memorable\". They went on to state that without the character, the \"Final Fight\" series would not be as notable, calling Haggar \"integral to its charm\". \"Nintendo Power\" listed Mike Haggar as having one of the best mustaches.\n\nHaggar has been called one of the best and most enjoyable characters to use in the \"Final Fight\" series by reviewers of the titles, and GamesRadar described him as \"arguably the most beloved character to come out of the \"Final Fight\" series\", expressing their wishes to see him appear in \"Super Street Fighter IV\". He ranked third in \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s list of the top ten video game politicians, in which he was compared directly to former Minnesota governor and wrestler Jesse Ventura. \"Play\" further discussed Mike's position as a Metro City's major alongside his actions to the point of listing him in their \"Top 8 Morally Neutral Characters On PS3\" feature. In another article, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" praised the character's behavior and actions in \"Final Fight\", citing him as their favorite aspect of \"Capcom Classics Collection\" and stating \"You'd have to be a damn communist not to vote for this guy\". IGN listed him as a character they hoped to see as an unlockable character in home ports of \"Street Fighter IV\", noting his fighting style as \"a perfect fit\" for the title; they later named him one of their favorite wrestlers in video games. GameSpy named him one of the \"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\" in video gaming, praising the brutality of his fighting style. GameDaily named Haggar one of their favorite Capcom characters of all time, placing him 18th on their \"Top 25\" list, and later named him one of their favorite heavily muscled characters in video games.\n\n"}
{"id": "1978274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978274", "title": "Egypt Eyalet", "text": "Egypt Eyalet\n\nThe Eyalet of Egypt operated as an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire from 1517 to 1867. It originated as a result of the conquest of Mamluk Egypt by the Ottomans in 1517, following the Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517) and the absorption of Syria into the Empire in 1516. The Ottomans administered Egypt as an eyalet of the their Empire ( \"\") from 1517 until 1867, with an interruption during the French occupation of 1798 to 1801.\n\nEgypt always proved a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control, due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks, the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries. As such, Egypt remained semi-autonomous under the Mamluks until Napoleon Bonaparte's French forces invaded in 1798. After Anglo-Turkish forces expelled the French in 1801, Muhammad Ali Pasha, an Albanian military commander of the Ottoman army in Egypt, seized power in 1805.\n\nEgypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province. Constantinople granted Egypt the status of an autonomous vassal state or \"Khedivate\" in 1867. Isma'il Pasha (Khedive from 1863 to 1879) and Tewfik Pasha (Khedive from 1879 to 1892) governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty until the British occupation of 1882. Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867–1914) remained a \"de jure\" Ottoman province until 5 November 1914, when it was declared a British protectorate in reaction to the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire joining the First World War on the side of the Central Powers ( October–November 1914).\n\nAfter the conquest of Egypt in 1517, the Ottoman Sultan Selim I left the country. Grand Vizier Yunus Pasha was awarded the governorship of Egypt. However, the sultan soon discovered that Yunus Pasha had created an extortion and bribery syndicate, and gave the office to Hayır Bey, the former Mamluk governor of Aleppo, who had contributed to the Ottoman victory at the Battle of Marj Dabiq.\n\nThe history of early Ottoman Egypt is a competition for power between the Mamluks and the representatives of the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nThe register by which a great portion of the land was a fief of the Mamluks was left unchanged, allowing the Mamluks to quickly return to positions of great influence. The Mamluk emirs were to be retained in office as heads of 12 sanjaks, into which Egypt was divided; and under the next sultan, Suleiman I, two chambers were created, called the Greater Divan and Lesser Divan, in which both the army and the ecclesiastical authorities were represented, to aid the pasha by their deliberations. Six regiments were constituted by the conqueror Selim for the protection of Egypt; to those Suleiman added a seventh, of Circassians.\n\nIt was the practice of the Sublime Porte to change the governor of Egypt at very short intervals, after a year or less. The fourth governor, Hain Ahmed Pasha, hearing that orders for his execution had come from Constantinople, endeavoured to make himself an independent ruler and had coins struck in his own name. His schemes were frustrated by two of the emirs whom he had imprisoned and who, escaping from their confinement, attacked him in his bath and attempted to kill him; although Ahmed Pasha escaped wounded, he was soon captured and executed by the Ottoman sultan's forces.\n\nIn 1527, the first survey of Egypt under the Ottomans was made, the official copy of the former registers having perished by fire; this new survey did not come into use until 1605. Egyptian lands were divided into four classes: the sultan's domain, fiefs, land for the maintenance of the army, and lands settled on religious foundations.\n\nThe constant changes in the government seem to have caused the army to get out of control at an early period of the Ottoman occupation, and at the beginning of the 17th century mutinies became common; in 1604, governor Maktul Hacı Ibrahim Pasha (then known just as Ibrahim Pasha) was murdered by the soldiers, and his head set on the Bab Zuweila, earning him the epithet \"Maktul\", \"the Slain\". The reason for these mutinies was the attempt made by successive pashas to put a stop to the extortion called the \"tulbah\", a forced payment exacted by the troops from the inhabitants of the country by the fiction of debts requiring to be discharged, which led to grievous ill-usage.\n\nIn 1609, a conflict broke out between the army and the pasha, who had loyal regiments on his side and the Bedouins. The soldiers went so far as to choose a sultan, and to provisionally divide the regions of Cairo between them. They were defeated by the governor Kara Mehmed Pasha, who, on 5 February 1610, entered Cairo in triumph, executed the ringleaders, and banished others to Yemen, earning him the nickname \"Kul Kıran\" (\"Slavebreaker\"). Historians speak of this event as a second conquest of Egypt for the Ottomans. A great financial reform was then effected by Kara Mehmed Pasha, who readjusted the burdens imposed on the different communities of Egypt in accordance with their means.\n\nWith the troubles that beset the metropolis of the Ottoman Empire, the governors appointed thence came to be treated by the Egyptians with continually decreasing respect. In July 1623, an order came from the Porte dismissing Kara Mustafa Pasha, and appointing Çeşteci Ali Pasha governor in his place. The officers met the deputy of the newly appointed governor and demanded from him the customary gratuity; when the deputy refused, they sent letters to the Porte declaring that they wished to have Kara Mustafa Pasha, and not Çeşteci Ali Pasha, as governor. Meanwhile, Çeşteci Ali Pasha had arrived at Alexandria and was met by a deputation from Cairo telling him that he was not wanted. He returned a mild answer; when a rejoinder came in the same style as the first message, he had the leader of the deputation arrested and imprisoned. The garrison of Alexandria then attacked the castle and rescued the prisoner, whereupon Çeşteci Ali Pasha was compelled to reembark on his ship and escape. Shortly thereafter, a rescript arrived from Constantinople confirming Kara Mustafa Pasha in the governorship. Mustafa was succeeded by Bayram Pasha in 1626.\n\nOfficers in the Ottoman Egyptian army were appointed locally from the various militias, and had strong ties to the Egyptian aristocracy. Thus Ridwan Bey, a Mamluk emir, was able to exercise \"de facto\" authority over Egypt from 1631 to 1656. In 1630, Koca Musa Pasha was the newly appointed governor, when the army took it upon themselves to depose him, in indignation at his execution of Kits Bey, an officer who was to have commanded an Egyptian force required for service in Persia. Koca Musa Pasha was given the choice of handing over the executioners to vengeance, or to resigning his place; as he refused to do the former, he was compelled to do the latter. In 1631, a rescript came from Constantinople, approving the conduct of the army and appointing Halil Pasha as Koca Musa Pasha's successor. Not only was the governor unsupported by the sultan against the troops, but each new governor regularly inflicted a fine upon his outgoing predecessor, under the name of money due to the treasury; the outgoing governor would not be allowed to leave Egypt until he had paid it. Besides the extortions to which this practice gave occasion, the country suffered greatly in these centuries from famine and pestilence. In the spring of 1619, pestilence is said to have killed 635,000 persons and, in 1643, completely desolated 230 villages.\n\nBy the 18th century, the importance of the pasha was superseded by that of the Mameluk beys; two offices, those of Shaykh al-Balad and Amir al-hajj—which were held by Mameluks—represented the real headship of the community. The process by which this came about is obscure, owing to the want of good chronicles for the Turkish period of Egyptian history. In 1707, the shaykh al-balad, Qasim Iywaz, was the head of one of two Mameluke factions, the Qasimites and the Fiqarites, between whom the seeds of enmity were sown by the pasha of the time, with the result that a fight took place between the factions outside Cairo, lasting eighty days. At the end of that time, Qasim Iywaz was killed and the office which he had held was given to his son Ismail. Ismail held this office for 16 years, while the pashas were constantly being changed, and succeeded in reconciling the two factions of Mamelukes. In 1711, an event known to chroniclers as the \"Great Sedition\" and the \"revolution\" occurred, when a religious fanatic preacher began to publicly denounce the practice of praying at the graves of Sufi saints, sparking a religious movement that wasn't crushed for three years until 1714. In 1724, Ismail was assassinated through the machinations of the pasha, and Shirkas Bey—of the opposing faction—was elevated to the office of Sheikh al-Balad in his place. He was soon driven from his post by one of his own faction called Dhu-'l-Fiqar, and fled to Upper Egypt. After a short time, he returned at the head of an army, and in the last of the ensuing battles Shirkas Bey met his end by drowning. Dhu-'l-Fiqar was himself assassinated in 1730. His place was filled by Othman Bey, who had served as his general in this war.\n\nIn 1743, Othman Bey was forced to fly from Egypt by the intrigues of two adventurers, Ibrahim and Ridwan Bey, who—when their scheme had succeeded—began a massacre of beys and others thought to be opposed to them. They proceeded to govern Egypt jointly, holding the offices of Sheikh al-Balad and Amir al-Hajj in alternate years. An attempt by one of the pashas to remove these two by a \"coup d'état\" failed, owing to the loyalty of the beys' armed supporters, who released Ibrahim and Ridwan from prison and compelled the pasha to flee to Constantinople. An attempt by a subsequent pasha, in accordance with secret orders from Constantinople, was so successful that some of the beys were killed. Ibrahim and Rilwan escaped and compelled the pasha to resign his governorship and return to Constantinople. Ibrahim was assassinated shortly afterwards by someone who had aspired to occupy one of the vacant beyships, which had instead been conferred upon Ali—who, as Ali Bey al-Kabir, was destined to play an important part in the history of Egypt. The murder of Ibrahim Bey took place in 1755, and his colleague Ridwan perished in the subsequent disputes.\n\nAli Bey, who had first distinguished himself by defending a caravan in Arabia against bandits, set himself the task of avenging the death of his former master Ibraihim. He spent eight years in purchasing Mamelukes and winning other adherents, exciting the suspicions of the Sheikh al-Balad Khalil Bey, who organised an attack upon him in the streets of Cairo—in consequence of which he fled to Upper Egypt. Here he met one Salib Bey, who had injuries to avenge upon Khalil Bey, and the two organised a force with which they returned to Cairo and defeated Khalil. Kalil was forced to flee to Iaifla, where for a time he concealed himself; eventually he was discovered, sent to Alexandria, and finally strangled. After Ali Bey's victory in 1760, he was made Sheikh al-Balad. He executed the murderer of his former master Ibrahim; but the resentment which this act aroused among the beys caused him to leave his post and flee to Syria, where he won the friendship of the governor of Acre, Zahir al-Umar, who obtained for him the goodwill of the Porte and reinstatement in his post as Sheikh al-Balad.\n\nIn 1766, after the death of his supporter, the grand vizier Raghib Pasha, he was again compelled to flee from Egypt to Yemen, but in the following year he was told that his party at Cairo was strong enough to permit his return. Resuming his office, he raised 18 of his friends to the rank of bey—among them Ibrahim and Murad, who were afterwards at the head of affairs—as well as Muhammad Abu-'l-Dhahab, who was closely connected with the rest of Ali Bey's career. Ali Bey used very severe measures to repress the brigandage of the Bedouins of Lower Egypt. He endeavoured to disband all forces except those which were exclusively under his own control.\n\nIn 1769, a demand came to Ali Bey for a force of 12,000 men, to be employed by the Porte in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. It was suggested at Constantinople, however, that Ali would employ this force when he collected it for securing his own independence, and a messenger was sent by the Porte to the pasha with orders for Ali's execution. Ali, being apprised of the despatch of this messenger by his agents in Constantinople, ordered that the messenger be waylaid and killed. The despatches were seized and read by Ali before an assembly of the beys, who were assured that the order for execution applied to all alike, and he urged them to fight for their lives. His proposals were received with enthusiasm by the beys whom he had created. Egypt was declared independent, and the pasha given 48 hours to quit the country. Zahir al-Umar, Pasha of Acre, to whom official information of the step taken by Ali Bey was sent, promised his aid and kept his word by compelling an army sent by the pasha of Damascus against Egypt to retreat.\n\nThe Porte was not able to take active measures at the time for the suppression of Ali Bey, who endeavoured to consolidate his dominions by sending expeditions against marauding tribes in both north and south Egypt, reforming the finance, and improving the administration of justice. His son-in-law, Abu-'l-Dhahab, was sent to subject the Hawwarah, who had occupied the land between Aswan and Asyut, and a force of 20,000 men was sent to conquer Yemen. An officer named Ismail Bey was sent with 8,000 men to acquire the eastern shore of the Red Sea, and Ilasan Bey was sent to occupy Jidda. In six months, the greater part of the Arabian peninsula was subject to Ali Bey, and he appointed a cousin of his own as Sharif of Mecca—who bestowed on Ali by an official proclamation the titles Sultan of Egypt and Khan of the Two Seas. In 1771, in virtue of this authorisation, he then struck coins in his own name and ordered his name to be mentioned in public worship.\n\nAbu-'l-Dhahab was sent with a force of 30,000 men in the same year to conquer Syria, and agents were sent to negotiate alliances with Venice and Russia. Reinforced by Ali Bey's ally Zahir al-Umar, Abu-'l-Dahab easily took the chief cities of Palestine and Syria, ending with Damascus, but at this point he appears to have entered into secret negotiations with the Porte, by which he undertook to restore Egypt to Ottoman suzerainty. He proceeded to evacuate Syria, and marched with all the forces he could collect to Upper Egypt, occupying Assiut in April 1772. Having collected additional troops from the Bedouins, he marched on Cairo. Ismail Bey was sent by Ali Bey with a force of 3,000 to check his advance, but Bastin Ismil and his troops joined Abu-'l-Dhahab. Ali Bey intended at first to defend himself as long as possible in the citadel at Cairo, but receiving information that his friend Zahir al-Umar was still willing to give him refuge, he left Cairo for Syria on 8 April 1772, one day before the entrance of Abu-'l-Dhahab.\n\nAt Acre, Ali's fortune seemed to be restored. A Russian vessel anchored outside the port and, in accordance with the agreement which he had made with the Russian empire, he was supplied with stores, ammunition, and a force of 3,000 Albanians. He sent one of his officers, Ali Bey al-Tantawi, to recover the Syrian towns evacuated by Abu-'l-Dhahab now in the possession of the Porte. He himself took Jaffa and Gaza, the former of which he gave to his friend Zahir al-Umar. On 1 February 1773, he received information from Cairo that Abu-'l-Dhahab had made himself Sheikh al-Balad, and in that capacity was practising unheard-of extortions, which were making Egyptians call for the return of Ali Bey. He accordingly started for Egypt at the head of an army of 8,000 men, and on 19 April met the army of Abu-'l-Dhahab at Salihiyya Madrasa. Ali's forces were successful at the first engagement, but when the battle was renewed two days later, he was deserted by some of his officers and prevented by illness and wounds from himself taking the conduct of affairs. The result was a complete defeat for his army, after which he declined to leave his tent; he was captured after a brave resistance and taken to Cairo, where he died seven days later.\n\nAfter Ali Bey's death, Egypt became once more a dependency of the Porte, governed by Abu-'l-Dhahab as Sheikh al-Balad with the title \"pasha\". He shortly afterwards received permission from the Porte to invade Syria, with the view of punishing Ali Bey's supporter Zahir al-Umar, and left Ismail Bey and Ibrahim Bey as his deputies in Cairo—who, by deserting Ali at the battle of Salihiyya, had brought about his downfall. After taking many cities in Palestine, Abu-'l-Dhahab died, the cause being unknown; Murad Bey, another of the deserters at Salihiyya, brought his forces back to Egypt on 26 May 1775.\n\nIsmail Bey now became Sheikh al-Balad, but was soon involved in a dispute with Ibrahim and Murad—who, after a time, succeeded in driving Ismail out of Egypt and establishing a joint rule similar to that which had been tried previously (as Sheikh al-Balad and Amir al-Hajj, respectively). The two were soon involved in quarrels, which at one time threatened to break out into open war, but this catastrophe was averted and the joint rule was maintained until 1786, when an expedition was sent by the Porte to restore Ottoman supremacy in Egypt. Murad Bey attempted to resist, but was easily defeated. He, with Ibrahim, decided to flee to Upper Egypt and await the trend of events. On 1 August, the Turkish commander Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha entered Cairo, and after violent measures, had been taken for the restoration of order; Ismail Bey was again made Sheikh al-Balad and a new pasha installed as governor. In January 1791, a terrible plague raged in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt, to which Ismail Bey and most of his family fell victims. Owing to the need for competent rulers, Ibrahim Bey and Murad Bey were sent for, and resumed their dual government. They were still in office in 1798 when Napoleon Bonaparte entered Egypt.\n\nThe ostensible object of the French expedition to Egypt was to reinstate the authority of the Sublime Porte and suppress the Mamluks; in the proclamation, printed with the Arabic types brought from the Propaganda press and issued shortly after the taking of Alexandria, Bonaparte declared that he revered God, the prophet Muhammad, and the Qur'an far more than the Mamluks revered them, and argued that all men were equal except so far as they were distinguished by their intellectual and moral excellences—of which the Mamluks had no great share. In the future, all posts in Egypt were to be open to all classes of the inhabitants; the conduct of affairs was to be committed to the men of talent, virtue, and learning; and to prove that the French were sincere Muslims, the overthrow of the papal authority in Rome was suggested.\n\nThat there might be no doubt of the friendly feeling of the French to the Porte, villages and towns which capitulated to the invaders were required to hoist the flags of both the Porte and the French republic, and in the thanksgiving prescribed to the Egyptians for their deliverance from the Mamluks, prayer was to be offered for both the sultan and the French army. It does not appear that the proclamation convinced many Egyptians of the truth of these professions. After the Battle of Embabeh (also commonly known as the \"Battle of the Pyramids\"), at which the forces of both Murad Bey and Ibrahim Bey were dispersed, the populace readily plundered the houses of the beys. A deputation was sent from al-Azhar to Bonaparte to ascertain his intentions; these proved to be a repetition of the terms of his proclamation, and—though the combination of loyalty to the French with loyalty to the sultan was unintelligible—a good understanding was at first established between the invaders and the Egyptians.\n\nA municipal council was established in Cairo, consisting of persons taken from the ranks of the sheiks, the Mamluks, and the French. Soon after, delegates from Alexandria and other important towns were added. This council did little more than register the decrees of the French commander, who continued to exercise dictatorial power.\n\nThe destruction of the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile, and the failure of the French forces sent to Upper Egypt (where they reached the first cataract) to obtain possession of the person of Murad Bey, shook the faith of the Egyptians in their invincibility. In consequence of a series of unwelcome innovations, the relations between conquerors and conquered grew more strained daily, until at last—on the occasion of the introduction of a house tax on 22 October 1798—an insurrection broke out in Cairo. The headquarters of the insurrection were in the University of Azhar. On this occasion, the French general Dupuy, lieutenant-governor of Cairo, was killed. The prompt measures of Bonaparte, aided by the arrival from Alexandria of General Jean Baptiste Kléber, quickly suppressed this rising; but the stabling of French cavalry in the mosque of Azhar gave great and permanent offence.\n\nIn consequence of this affair, the deliberative council was suppressed, but on 25 December a fresh proclamation was issued reconstituting the two divans which had been created by the Turks; the special divan was to consist of 14 persons chosen by lot out of 60 government nominees, and was to meet daily. The general divan was to consist of functionaries, and to meet on emergencies.\n\nIn consequence of dispatches that reached Bonaparte on 3 January 1799, announcing the intention of the Porte to invade the country with the object of recovering it by force, Bonaparte resolved on his Syrian expedition, and appointed governors for Cairo, Alexandria, and Upper Egypt, to govern during his absence.\n\nBonaparte returned from that ill-fated expedition at the beginning of June. Murad Bey and Ibrahim Bey had taken advantage of this opportunity to collect their forces and attempt a joint attack on Cairo, but Bonaparte arrived in time to defeat it. In the last week of July, he inflicted a crushing defeat on the Turkish army that had landed at Aboukir, aided by the British fleet commanded by Sir Sidney Smith.\n\nShortly after his victory, Bonaparte left Egypt, having appointed Kléber to govern in his absence—which he informed the sheiks of Cairo was not to last more than three months. Kléber regarded the condition of the French invaders as extremely perilous, and wrote to inform the French republic of the facts. A double expedition was sent by the Porte shortly after Bonaparte's departure for the recovery of Egypt: one force being dispatched by sea to Damietta, while another under Yousuf Pasha took the land route from Damascus by al-Arish. The first force had some success, in consequence of which the Turks agreed to a convention on 24 January 1800, by virtue of which the French were to quit Egypt. The Turkish troops advanced to Bilbeis, where they were received by the sheiks from Cairo; the Mamluks also returned to Cairo from their hiding-places.\n\nBefore the preparations for the departure of the French were completed, orders came to Smith from the British government forbidding the carrying-out of the convention unless the French army were treated as prisoners of war. When these orders were communicated to Kléber, he cancelled the orders previously given to the troops and proceeded to put the country in a state of defence. His departure, with most of the army, to attack the Turks at Mataria led to riots in Cairo. The national party was unable to gain possession of the citadel, and Kléber, having defeated the Turks, was soon able to return to the capital. On 14 April he bombarded Bulaq, and proceeded to bombard Cairo itself, which was taken the following night. Order was soon restored, and a fine of 12 million francs was imposed upon the rioters. Murad Bey sought an interview with Kléber, and succeeded in obtaining the government of Upper Egypt from him. Murad Bey died shortly afterwards and was succeeded by Osman Bey al-Bardisi.\n\nOn 14 June, Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, and was said to have been incited to the deed by a Janissary refugee at Jerusalem, who had brought letters to the sheikhs of the Azhar. Although they gave him no support, three of the sheikhs were executed by the French as accessories-before-the-fact. The assassin himself was tortured and impaled, despite the promise of a pardon if he named his associates. The command of the army then devolved on General J.F. (Baron de) Menou, a man who had professed Islam, and who endeavoured to conciliate the Muslim population by various measures—such as excluding all Christians (with the exception of one Frenchman) from the \"divan\", replacing Copts who were in government service with Muslims, and subjecting French residents to taxes. Whatever popularity might have been gained by these measures was counteracted by his declaration of a French protectorate over Egypt, which was to count as a French colony.\n\nIn the first weeks of March 1801, the English under Sir Ralph Abercromby effected a landing at Abu Qir, and proceeded to invest Alexandria, where they were attacked by Menou; the French were repulsed, but the English commander was mortally wounded in the action. On the 25th, fresh Turkish reinforcements arrived with the fleet of the Kapudan Pasha Hüseyin. A combined English and Turkish force was sent to take Rashid. On 30 May, General A. D. Belliard, the French commander in Cairo, was assailed on two sides by British forces under General John Hely Hutchinson and Turks under Yusuf Pasha; after negotiations, Belliard agreed to evacuate Cairo and to sail with his 13,734 troops to France. On 30 August, Menou was compelled to accept similar conditions, and his force of 10,000 left Alexandria for Europe in September. This was the termination of the French occupation of Egypt. The chief permanent monument of the occupation was the \"Description de l'Egypte\", compiled by the French savants who accompanied the expedition.\n\nSoon after the French evacuated Egypt, the country became the scene of more severe troubles, a consequence of the Ottomans' attempts to destroy the power of the Mamluks. In defiance of promises to the British Government, orders were transmitted from Constantinople to Hüseyin Pasha to ensnare and put to death the principal beys. According to the Egyptian contemporary historian al-Jabarti, they were invited to an entertainment on board the Turkish flagship and then attacked; however, Sir Robert Wilson and M.F. Mengin stated that they were fired upon in open boats in Abu Qir Bay. They offered resistance, but were overpowered, and some killed; others were made prisoners. Among the prisoners was Osman Bey al-Bardisi, who was severely wounded. The British General Hutchinson, informed of this treachery, immediately took threatening measures against the Turks, causing them to surrender the killed, wounded, and imprisoned Egyptians to him. At the same time, Yusuf Pasha arrested all the beys in Cairo, but soon the British compelled him to release them.\n\nHusrev Pasha was the first Ottoman governor of Egypt after the expulsion of the French. The form of government, however, was not the same as that before the French invasion, for the Mamluks were not reinstated. The pasha, and through him the Sultan, repeatedly tried to either ensnare them or to beguile them into submission. These efforts failing, Husrev took the field and a Turkish detachment 7,000 strong was dispatched against the Mamluks to Damanhur—whence they had descended from Upper Egypt—and was defeated by a small force under either al-Alfi or his lieutenant al-Bardisi. Their ammunition and guns fell into the hands of the Mamluks. This led to a long civil war between the Albanians, Mamluks, and Ottomans.\n\nAcknowledging the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan and at his command, Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 20,000 men (including 2,000 horses) under the command of his son Tusun, a youth of sixteen, against the Saudis in the Ottoman–Saudi War. By the end of 1811, Tusun had received reinforcements and captured Medina after a prolonged siege. He next took Jeddah and Mecca, defeating the Saudi beyond the latter and capturing their general.\n\nAfter the death of the Saudi leader Saud, Muhammad Ali concluded a treaty with Saud's son and successor, Abdullah I in 1815.\n\nTusun returned to Egypt on hearing of the military revolt at Cairo, but died in 1816 at the early age of twenty. Muhammad Ali, dissatisfied with the treaty concluded with the Saudis, and with the non-fulfillment of certain of its clauses, determined to send another army to Arabia. This expedition, under his eldest son Ibrahim Pasha, left in the autumn of 1816 and captured the Saudi capital of Diriyah in 1818.\n\nDuring Muhammad Ali's absence in Arabia his representative at Cairo had completed the confiscation, begun in 1808, of almost all the lands belonging to private individuals, who were forced to accept instead inadequate pensions. By this revolutionary method of land nationalization Muhammad Ali became proprietor of nearly all the soil of Egypt. The pasha also attempted to reorganize his troops on European lines, but this led to a formidable mutiny in Cairo. The revolt was reduced by presents to the chiefs of the insurgents, and Muhammad Ali ordered that the sufferers by the disturbances should receive compensation from the treasury. The project of the Nizam Gedid (New System) was, in consequence of this mutiny, abandoned for a time.\n\nWhile Ibrahim was engaged in the second Arabian campaign the pasha turned his attention to strengthening the Egyptian economy. He created state monopolies over the chief products of the country. He set up a number of factories and began digging in 1819 a new canal to Alexandria, called the Mahmudiya (after the reigning sultan of Turkey). The old canal had long fallen into decay, and the necessity of a safe channel between Alexandria and the Nile was much felt. The conclusion in 1838 of a commercial treaty with Turkey, negotiated by Sir Henry Bulwer (Lord Darling), struck a deathblow to the system of monopolies, though the application of the treaty to Egypt was delayed for some years.\n\nAnother notable fact in the economic progress of the country was the development of the cultivation of cotton in the Delta in 1822 and onwards. The cotton grown previously had been brought from the Sudan by Maho Bey. By organizing the new industry, within a few years Muhammad Ali was able to extract considerable revenues.\n\nEfforts were made to promote education and the study of medicine. To European merchants, on whom he was dependent for the sale of his exports, Muhammad Ali showed much favor, and under his influence the port of Alexandria again rose into importance. It was also under Muhammad Ali's encouragement that the overland transit of goods from Europe to India via Egypt was resumed.\n\nSultan Mahmud II was also planning reforms borrowed from the West, and Muhammad Ali, who had had plenty of opportunity of observing the superiority of European methods of warfare, was determined to anticipate the sultan in the creation of a fleet and an army on European lines.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, he had already expended much time and energy in organizing a fleet and in training, under the supervision of French instructors, native officers and artificers.\n\nBy 1823, he had succeeded in carrying out the reorganization of his army on European lines, the turbulent Turkish and Albanian elements being replaced by Sudanese and \"fellahin\". The effectiveness of the new force was demonstrated in the suppression of an 1823 revolt of the Albanians in Cairo by six disciplined Sudanese regiments; after which Mehemet Ali was no more troubled with military mutinies.\n\nEgypt under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century had the fifth most productive cotton industry in the world, in terms of the number of spindles per capita. The industry was initially driven by machinery that relied on traditional energy sources, such as animal power, water wheels, and windmills, which were also the principle energy sources in Western Europe up until around 1870. While steam power had been experimented with in Ottoman Egypt by engineer Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in 1551, when he invented a steam jack driven by a rudimentary steam turbine, it was under Muhammad Ali in the early 19th century that steam engines were introduced to Egyptian industrial manufacturing. While there was a lack of coal deposits in Egypt, prospectors searched for coal deposits there, and manufactured boilers which were installed in Egyptian industries such as ironworks, textile manufacturing, paper mills and hulling mills. Coal was also imported from overseas, at similar prices to what imported coal cost in France, until the 1830s, when Egypt gained access to coal sources in Lebanon, which had a yearly coal output of 4,000 tons. Compared to Western Europe, Egypt also had superior agriculture and an efficient transport network through the Nile. Economic historian Jean Batou argues that the necessary economic conditions for rapid industrialization existed in Egypt during the 1820s–1830s, as well as for the adoption of oil as a potential energy source for its steam engines later in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1820 Muhammad Ali gave orders to commence the conquest of eastern Libya. Ali's intentions for Sudan was to extend his rule southward, to capture the valuable caravan trade bound for the Red Sea, disperse Mamluks who have fled south, and to secure the rich gold mines which he believed to exist in Sennar. He also saw in the campaign a means of getting rid of his disaffected troops, and of obtaining a sufficient number of captives to form the nucleus of the new army.\n\nThe forces destined for this service were led by Ismail Kamil Pasha, the youngest son of Muhammad Ali. They consisted of between 4,000 and 5,000 men, being Turks and Arabs. They left Cairo in July 1820. Nubia did not put up much of a fight, the Shaigiya tribe immediately beyond the province of Dongola were defeated, the remnant of the Mamluks dispersed, and Sennar was destroyed.\n\nAlthough nominally part of the Ottoman Empire since 1554, between 1821 and 1841, Muhammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, came to control Yemen and the \"sahil\", with Zeila included. After the Egyptians withdrew from the Yemeni seaboard in 1841, \"Haj\" Ali Shermerki, a successful and ambitious Somali merchant, purchased from them executive rights over Zeila. Shermerki's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden (modern day Somali region of Ethiopia). In 1845, Shermerki deployed a few matchlock men to wrest control of neighboring Berbera from that town's then feuding Somali authorities. This alarmed the Emir of Harar, who, having already been at loggerheads with Shermerki over fiscal matters, was concerned about the ramifications that these movements might ultimately have on his own city's commerce. The Emir consequently urged Berbera's leaders to reconcile and mount a resistance against Shermerki's troops. Shermerki was later succeeded as Governor of Zeila by Abu Bakr Pasha, a local Afar statesman.\n\nIn 1874–75, the Egyptians obtained a \"firman\" from the Ottomans by which they secured claims over the city. At the same time, the Egyptians received British recognition of their nominal jurisdiction as far east as Cape Guardafui. In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years (1870–84). When the Egyptian garrison in Harar was evacuated in 1885, Zeila became caught up in the competition between the Tadjoura-based French and the British for control of the strategic Gulf of Aden littoral. I.M. Lewis mentions that \"by the end of 1885 Britain was preparing to resist an expected French landing at Zeila.\" However, the two powers decided instead to turn to negotiations.\n\nIn 1824 a native rebellion broke out in Upper Egypt headed by Ahmed, an inhabitant of al-Salimiyyah, a village situated a few miles above Thebes. He proclaimed himself a prophet, and was soon followed by between 20,000 and 30,000 insurgents, mostly peasants, but some of them deserters from the Nizam Gedid, for that force was yet in a half-organized state. The insurrection was crushed by Muhammad Ali, and about one fourth of Ahmad's followers perished, but he himself escaped. The subsequent years saw an imposition of order across Egypt and Ali's new highly trained and disciplined forces spread across the nation.\n\nAli's foresight in reforming his military forces was rewarded by the invitation of the sultan to help him in the task of subduing the Greek insurgents, offering as reward the pashaliks of the Morea and of Syria. In the autumn of 1824 a fleet of 60 Egyptian warships carrying a large force of 17,000 disciplined troops concentrated in Suda Bay, and, in the following March, with Ibrahin as commander-in-chief landed in the Morea.\n\nHis naval superiority wrested from the Greeks the command of a great deal of the sea, on which the fate of the insurrection ultimately depended, while on land the Greek irregular bands, having largely soundly beaten the Porte's troops, had finally met a worthy foe in Ibrahim's disciplined troops. The history of the events that led up to the battle of Navarino. The withdrawal of the Egyptians from the Morea was ultimately due to the action of Admiral Sir Edward Codrington, who early in August 1828 appeared before Alexandria and induced the pash to sign a convention undertaking to recall Ibrahim and his army.\n\nAli went to war against the sultan on pretext of chastising the ex-mamluk Abdullah Pasha of Acre, for refusing to send back Egyptian fugitives from the effects of Muhammad Ali's reforms. The true reason was the refusal of Sultan Mahmud to hand over Syria according to agreement.\nFor ten years from this date the relations of sultan and pasha remained in the forefront of the questions which agitated the diplomatic world. It was not only the very existence of the Ottoman Empire that seemed to be at stake, but Egypt itself had become more than ever an object of attention, to British statesmen especially, and in the issue of the struggle were involved the interests of the British Empire in the two routes to India by the Isthmus of Suez and the valley of the Euphrates.\n\nIbrahim, who once more commanded in his father's name, launched another brilliant campaign beginning with the storming of Acre on 27 May 1832, and culminating in the rout and capture of Reshid Pasha at Konya on 21 December.\nSoon after he was blocked by the intervention of Russia, however. As the result of endless discussions between the representatives of the powers, the Porte and the pasha, the Convention of Kütahya was signed on 14 May 1833, by which the sultan agreed to bestow on Muhammad Ali the pashaliks of Syria, Damascus, Aleppo and Itcheli, together with the district of Adana.\n\nMuhammad Ali now ruled over a virtually independent empire, subject only to a moderate tribute, stretching from the Sudan to the Taurus Mountains. However the unsound foundations of his authority were not long in revealing themselves. Scarcely a year from the signing of the Convention of Kutaya the application by Ibrahim of Egyptian methods of government, notably of the monopolies and conscription, had driven Syrian Druze and Sunni Arabs, who had welcomed him as a deliverer, into revolt. The unrest was suppressed by Muhammad Ali in person, and the Syrians were terrorized, but their discontent encouraged the Sultan Mahmud to hope for revenge, and a renewal of the conflict was only staved off by the anxious efforts of the European powers.\n\nIn the spring of 1839 the sultan ordered his army, concentrated under Reshid in the border district of Bir on the Euphrates, to advance over the Syrian frontier. Ibrahim, seeing his flank menaced, attacked it at Nezib on 24 June. Once more, however, the Ottomans were utterly routed. Six days later, before the news reached Constantinople, Mahmud died.\n\nNow, with the defeat of the Ottomans and the conquest of Syria, Muhammad Ali had reached the height of his power, controlling Egypt, the Sudan, and Syria. He saw the Ottoman armies collapse or fall into disorganization after their defeat in Syria, and it looked like the Middle East and Anatolia were his for the taking.\n\nWith the Ottoman Empire at the feet of Muhammad Ali, the European powers were greatly alarmed and now put into action a plan that had been prepared to meet a contingency which had been long foreseen. Their intervention during the Oriental Crisis of 1840 was prompt, and they made short work of Muhammad Ali's armed forces. But the Western Powers, the West had no intention of removing Ali and the block he placed on Ottoman Power. Thus, though the peace treaty was harsh, it left the Muhammad Ali dynasty in power.\n\nThe government of the pashalik of Egypt was made hereditary in the family of Muhammad Ali in 1841.\n\nVarious restrictions were laid upon Muhammad Ali, emphasizing his position as vassal. He was forbidden to maintain a fleet and his army was not to exceed 18,000 men. The pasha was no longer a figure in European politics, but he continued to occupy himself with his improvements in Egypt. The long wars combined with a murrain of cattle in 1842 and a destructive Nile flood. In 1843 there was a plague of locusts where whole villages were depopulated.\n\nIn 1844–45 there was some improvement in the condition of the country as a result of financial reforms the pasha executed. Muhammad Ali, who had been granted the honorary rank of grand vizier in 1842, paid a visit to Istanbul in 1846, where he became reconciled to his old enemy Khosrev Pasha, whom he had not seen since he spared his life at Cairo in 1803. In 1847 Muhammad Ali laid the foundation stone of the great bridge across the Nile at the beginning of the Delta. Towards the end of 1847, the aged pasha's previously sharp mind began to give way, and by the following June he was no longer capable of administering the government. In September 1848 Ibrahim was acknowledged by the Porte as ruler of the pashalik, but he died in November.\n\nOn Ibrahim's death in November 1848 the government of Egypt fell to his nephew Abbas I, the son of Tusun Abbasad. Abbas put an end to the system of commercial monopolies, and during his reign the railway from Alexandria to Cairo was begun at the instigation of the British government. Opposed to European ways, Abbas lived in great seclusion. After a reign of less than six years he was murdered in July 1854 by two of his slaves.\n\nHe was succeeded by his uncle Said Pasha, the favorite son of Muhammad Ali, who lacked the strength of mind or physical health needed to execute the beneficent projects which he conceived.\nHe had a genuine regard for the welfare of the fellahin, and a land law of 1858 secured for them an acknowledgment of freehold as against the crown.\n\nThe pasha was much under French influence, and in 1854 was induced to grant to the French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps a concession for the construction of the Suez Canal.\n\nIn January 1863 Said Pasha died and was succeeded by his nephew Ismail, a son of Ibrahim Pasha.\n\nThe reign of Ismail, from 1863 to 1879, was for a while hailed as a new era into modern Egypt. He attempted vast schemes of reform, but these coupled with his personal extravagance led to bankruptcy, and the later part of his reign is historically important simply for its leading to European intervention in, and occupation of, Egypt.\n\nIn 1866 Ismail was granted by the sultan a firman obtained on condition of the increase of the tribute from £376,000 to £720,000. In the next year another firman bestowed upon him the title of khedive in lieu of that of wali, marking the end of Egypt as an Ottoman province.\n\nIsmail ruled the Khedivate of Egypt until his deposition in 1879.\nHis rule is closely connected to the building of the Suez Canal.\nOn his accession, he refused to ratify the concessions to the Canal company made by Said, and the question was referred in 1864 to the arbitration of Napoleon III, who awarded £3,800,000 to the company as compensation for their losses. When the canal finally opened, Ismail held a festival of unprecedented scope, inviting dignitaries from around the world.\n\nThese developments, together with the costly war against Yohannes IV of Ethiopia, left Egypt in deep\ndebt to the European powers. A national debt of over one hundred million pounds sterling (as opposed to three millions when he became viceroy) had been incurred by the khedive, whose fundamental idea of liquidating his borrowings was to borrow at increased interest. When he could raise no more loans, he sold his Suez Canal shares (in 1875) to the British Government for only £3,976,582; this was immediately followed by the beginning of foreign intervention.\nIn December 1875, Stephen Cave was sent out by the British government to inquire into the finances of Egypt, and in April 1876 his report was published, advising that in view of the waste and extravagance it was necessary for foreign Powers to interfere in order to restore credit. The result was the establishment of the Caisse de la Dette.\n\nThis control of the country was unacceptable to many Egyptians, who united behind a disaffected Colonel Ahmed Urabi. The Urabi Revolt consumed Egypt. With the country largely in the hands of Urabi, the British and French governments pressured the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II to depose Ismail Pasha, and this was done on 26 June 1879. The more pliable Tewfik Pasha, Ismail's son, was made his successor.\nA large military demonstration in September 1881 forced the Khedive Tewfiq to dismiss his Prime Minister. In April 1882 France and Great Britain sent warships to Alexandria to bolster the Khedive amidst a turbulent climate. Tawfiq moved to Alexandria for fear of his own safety as army officers led by Ahmed Urabi began to take control of the government. By June Egypt was in the hands of nationalists opposed to European domination of the country. A British naval bombardment of Alexandria had little effect on the opposition which led to the landing of a British expeditionary force at both ends of the Suez Canal in August 1882. The British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army at Tel El Kebir in September and took control of the country putting Tawfiq back in control. The Khedivate of Egypt remained under British military occupation until the establishment of the British protectorate of Egypt in 1914.\n\nAfter conquering Egypt, the Ottomans retained the divisions created by the Mamluks, which were structured into 13 sub-provinces comprising 24 qirats. Unlike the situation in other Ottoman provinces, the term sanjak did not carry territorial connotations, as the timar system was not applied there. The rank of sanjak-bey, which was standard in the Empire, was not used in Egypt.\n\nThe thirteen sub-provinces were:\n\nAdditionally, there was a short-lived sub-province named \"Hatt-ı Üstuva\" meaning Equador in Ottoman Turkish, which was established as a vilayet and existed from 1872 to 1882 covering the areas of today's southern South Sudan and Northern Uganda, including cities like Lado and Wadelai.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1978276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978276", "title": "City Square, Leeds", "text": "City Square, Leeds\n\nCity Square is a paved area north of Leeds railway station at the junction of Park Row to the east and Wellington Street to the south. It is a triangular area where six roads meet: Infirmary Street and Park Row to the north, Boar Lane and Bishopsgate Street to the south-east, and Quebec Street and Wellington Street to the south-west. The only building with a direct frontage is the former General Post Office, on the north-west side.\n\nProposals were made in 1893 to transform the area in front of the station. The demolition of Leeds' Coloured Cloth Hall and Quebec House gave an open space in which a new General Post Office was constructed in 1896 with a public space in front. One proposal was to name the development after John Smeaton, the famous local engineer, but the council unanimously opted to call it City Square, as Leeds was being made a city that year. The initial plan had tramway waiting rooms, and public lavatories welcoming new visitors to Leeds. However, Colonel Thomas Walter Harding (Lord Mayor of Leeds between 1898-9) was so dismayed that he commissioned William Bakewell to design a square more in the style of an Italian piazza, with statues and trees.\n\nIn the Second World War, during an air raid on Leeds, the Luftwaffe bombed City Square. It was at the time the site of a public air raid shelter, which did not withstand the bombing and was significantly damaged.\n\nIn 1997, traffic that went through the City Square, mainly buses and taxis, was diverted to the Leeds City Centre \"Loop\" traffic scheme. The City Square area was refurbished in 2003, which included closing off one side of the square to traffic, rearranging the statues and adding fountains and traditional street furniture to the square. The fountains were removed in 2013.\n\nThe former Leeds General Post Office covers the northwest side of the square. It is a Grade II listed building, in classical style by architect Sir Henry Tanner. It is in Ashlar, with slate and lead roofs of four stories and two main entrances with columns on the square, with a central clock tower. There are other entrances to the sides on Quebec Street and Infirmary Street. The telephone booths outside the former post office are K6 design and also Grade II listed buildings.\n\nIt opened 18 May 1896. Two figures by William Silver Frith representing \"Reading\" and \"Writing\" are over one entrance, while \"Reading\" and \"Philosophy\" are over the other. Four figures above have been said to represent Time, Air, Light and Earth. Along with other smaller decorations are two owls on the front.\nAll are in bronze and larger than life. There is a large equestrian statue, four statues of famous men, and a ring of female nudes, or nymphs, acting as lampholders. The statues were part of a celebration of Leeds changing status from a town to a city. All are at least Grade II listed buildings.\n\nThe large equestrian statue is of Edward, the Black Prince (1330–1376), and is a major work of Thomas Brock (1847–1922). Edward had no specific connection with Leeds, and the choice of subject therefore caused something of a stir. The statue is on a pedestal with relief panels depicting some of the prince's notable victories. It (along with most of the statues) was funded by Colonel Thomas Walter Harding. Brock took seven years to make it, and it had to be cast in Belgium because it was too big for any British foundry. It was carried by sea to Hull, then on a barge along the River Aire to Leeds. It was unveiled on 16 September 1903 to cheering crowds. It is Grade II* listed.\nThough again James Watt had no specific connection to Leeds, he was a famous engineer and typified the technological change which had made Leeds into a city. This was erected in 1903. It is by Henry Charles Fehr and the gift of Richard Wainwright.\n\nJohn Harrison (1579–1656) was a local cloth merchant and benefactor of Leeds, having built a church and a grammar school. This was erected in 1903. It is also by H. C. Fehr and the gift of Councillor Richard Boston.\n\nDr Walter Hook (1798–1875) was a vicar of Leeds and a major influence on both religion and education in the city. He was responsible for rebuilding the parish church (now Leeds Minster) and thirty schools. This was erected in 1902. It is by F. W. Pomeroy and the gift of Colonel Thomas Walter Harding.\n\nThe famous chemist and theologian Joseph Priestley lived in Leeds from 1767 to 1773, and was the minister at Mill Hill Chapel, which is on the square. He used carbon dioxide from the local brewery to continue his experiments on gases. This was erected in 1903. It is by Alfred Drury and the gift of Colonel Thomas Walter Harding.\nThe most controversial feature of the square was a ring of eight nude females holding lamps, which attracted critical letters to the Yorkshire Post when unveiled in 1899. They are by Alfred Drury, now celebrated as a pioneer of the New Sculpture. They are of two forms, one named as \"Morn\" holding a lamp in her right hand and clutching some flowers, and the other named as \"Even\" holding a lamp in her left hand, with her other hand to her head.\n\nThey were originally arranged on the points of the compass in a circle around the Black Prince. In 1956 they were removed from this arrangement and put in two rows of four. In the 1990s, it was planned to remove them altogether, as Victorian public art was considered by many to be worthless. However, this was resisted and they were placed in their present positions of a three-quarter circle.\nThe square is overlooked by the listed buildings Queens Hotel on the South and Mill Hill Chapel on the East, plus a modern skyscraper, No. 1 City Square (Norwich Union Building) completed 1998 by Abbey Hanson Rowe on the North. The sculpture \"Legs walking\" by Leeds-born Kenneth Armitage was erected outside Mill Hill Chapel in 2018. On the Southwest between Quebec Street and Wellington Street is the former Majestic Cinema and Ballroom (1921), a Grade II listed building in terracotta by the Leeds Fireclay Co. On the Southeast corner is the Park Plaza Hotel,a 2003 recladding of a 1965 office tower block called Exchange House, and the former Yorkshire Bank (1899, Grade II listed), now a bar, in granite with a distinctive copper dome. \n\nThe square is the official start point for the 104 mile long distance walk The White Rose Way which finishes in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.\n\n"}

The programme is undertaken over four years. Students conduct PhD-equivalent research and undertake taught business and technical courses whilst working closely with an industrial sponsor. Successful candidates are awarded the degree of Doctor of Engineering (EngD) and are addressed as \"doctor\".\n\nThe first programmes began in 1992. In 2009, Engineering Doctorate schemes were offered by 45 UK universities, both singly or in partnership with other universities as industrial doctorate centres. Students on the scheme are encouraged to describe themselves as 'research engineers' rather than 'research students' and as of 2009 the minimum funding level was £1,500 higher than the minimum funding level for PhD students. Advocates of the scheme like to draw attention to the fact that EngD students share some courses with MBA students.\n\nIn the UK a similar formation to doctorate is the NVQ 8 or QCF 8. However, a doctoral degree typically incorporates a research project which must offer an original contribution to knowledge within an academic subject area; an element which NVQs lack.\n\nIn summary, an EngD is essentially an engineering PhD with a solid industrial base and an additional taught element.\n\nCountries following the German/US model of education usually have similar requirements for awarding Ph.D.(Eng.) and doctor of engineering degrees. The common degree abbreviations in the USA are D.Eng., D.Eng.Sc./Eng.Sc.D, whereas in the German-speaking world it is more commonly known as Dr.-Ing.\n\nThe Engineering Doctorate (EngD) scheme was established by the EPSRC in 1992 following the recommendations of the 1990 Engineering Doctorate Report, produced by a working group chaired by Professor John Parnaby. The scheme was launched with five centres - at Warwick, UMIST and Manchester universities and a Welsh consortium led by University College Swansea. After a 1997 review, a further tranche of five centres was established, and further centres were added in 2001 and 2006 following calls by EPSRC in particular areas of identified national need.\n\nIn a 2006 stakeholder survey of the scheme conducted on behalf of EPSRC it was found that the quality of output of research engineers was perceived to match or exceed that of a PhD. However, the majority of respondents disagreed with claims that EngDs were recruited to higher-paid posts than PhDs or that EngDs were more desirable to employers than PhDs. Observations were made that the EngD was not widely known, and that universities may offer EngD degrees that were not necessarily of the format promoted by the EPSRC.\n\nA March 2007 \"Review of the EPSRC Engineering Doctorate Centres\" noted that since 1992, some 1230 research engineers had been enrolled, sponsored by over 510 different companies (28 had sponsored at least six REs), at 22 centres based at 14 universities (some jointly run by several collaborating universities). The panel remained convinced of the value and performance of the EngD scheme, and made six key recommendations including clearer brand definition, academic study of the longer term impacts of the scheme, promotion of the scheme to potential new sponsors, business sectors and REs, work with the Engineering Council UK to develop a career path for REs to Chartered Engineer status, creation of a virtual \"EngD Academy\", and increased resources for the scheme.\n\nWork on establishing an Association of Engineering Doctorates began in 2010.\n\nThe following EPSRC-funded centres have offered EngDs:\n\n\n\n"}

He is the current Director of Marketing and Public Relations for Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas. He is best known for his appearances with the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based professional wrestling promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling from 1995 to 2001 under the ring names Sign Guy Dudley and Lou E. Dangerously.\n\nBefore being publicly hired by ECW, D'Angeli was an ECW \"fan\" that came dressed like a Dudley family member, holding up signs like \"Welcome to Dudley World\" and sitting near other very well known ECW fans like Hat Guy and the original ECW Sign Guy. In reality, D'Angeli was already on ECW's payroll and was planted in the crowd to further the Dudley Family angle. D'Angeli would go on to be trained as a manager by Tommy Dreamer and Tazz.\n\nD'Angeli started out in ECW as Sign Guy Dudley, the manager of the Dudley Boyz and member of the Dudley family. He led Buh Buh Ray and D-Von Dudley to 8 ECW World Tag Team Championship reigns before they left for World Wrestling Federation (WWF).\n\nAfter leaving the Dudleys, D'Angeli became a rip-off character of his boss, Paul Heyman, called \"Lou E. Dangerously\", with the gimmick of a giant cell phone (Heyman's ring name when a manager in World Championship Wrestling and early ECW was Paul E. Dangerously). As Dangerously, D'Angeli is known for several run-ins with Billy Corgan from The Smashing Pumpkins. On 22 July 2000, Corgan took to the ring at a match in Peoria, Illinois to play the national anthem, but Dangerously interrupted and harangued him, ending in Corgan hitting him over the head with an acoustic guitar. D'Angeli managed the tag team of Julio Dinero and EZ Money, which became Hot Commodity with the addition of Chris Hamrick and Elektra. He also managed Chris Chetti for a short stint in late 2000. D'Angeli appeared onstage before a Smashing Pumpkins gig in Philadelphia in October 2007, baiting the crowd.\n\nHe also refounded the Dangerous Alliance in December 1999.\n\nWhen ECW went bankrupt, Lou went to work for other pro wrestling companies such as Combat Zone Wrestling, PWF and MECW. At one point D'Angeli was working with Steve Corino on booking the PWF. D'Angeli last appeared in a ring as a manager in February 2003 with Alexis Laree (Mickie James) and Justin Credible. D'Angeli had a cameo at the 2006 WWE ECW One Night Stand PPV when Rob Van Dam defeated John Cena for the WWE Title.\n\nMore recently D'Angeli appeared as part of Montel Vontavious Porter's entourage on \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV\" from Madison Square Garden when Evander Holyfield, in place of MVP, had a boxing match with Matt Hardy.\n\nLou appeared as Lou E. Dangerously at ACID FEST in honor of Trent Acid on July 10, 2010.\n\nIn March 2012 Lou returned to wrestling with Billy Corgan's group Resistance Pro based out of Chicago. He was brought in to specifically write for the shows as well as help talent given his performing and promoting history with ECW and WWE.\n\nD'Angeli currently works as the Director of Marketing and Public Relations for the Cirque Du Soleil shows based out of Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nD'Angeli worked for World Wrestling Entertainment in marketing until August 15, 2010.

(\"With Naked ... in Hand\") is the third studio album by the Bulgarian rock band Hipodil, released in 1996 under the Riva Sound label. The album marks a slight departure from the established musical style of the group, with many experiments and new influences including plenty of ska motifs. The most important change however was the lack of openly \"funny\" songs which probably was provoked by the deteriorating economic situation in Bulgaria, the galloping inflation and the rise in the organised crime at the time. \"S gol v rukata...\" never reached the success of Hipodil's previous effort Nekuf ujas, nekuf at or of their next album Nadurveni vuglishta.\n\nThough the album lacks the freshness and the humorous flavour of Hipodil's other releases, some of the tracks, like \"\"Drashtya s nokti\"\", \"\"Kato Slunce\"\" and \"\"Sprete ni toka\"\" offer the band's trademark puns, parodies and mockery. \"\"3X3\"\" parodies the pop-folk, also known as chalga, quite popular in Bulgaria. \n\"\"Aferata 'Drayfus'\"\" deals with alcohol-inflicted vomiting and the title is a pun - an out-of-context use of the name of the Dreyfus Affair as the name Dreyfus in Bulgarian sounds similar to the slang verb \"\"drayfam\"\", which means \"\"to vomit\"\".

He was also the creator of the Mr. Olympia, the Ms. Olympia and the Masters Olympia bodybuilding contests. He was the publisher of several bodybuilding and fitness-related magazines, most notably \"Muscle & Fitness\", \"Flex\", \"Men's Fitness\" and \"Shape\", and the manufacturer of a line of fitness equipment and fitness supplements.\n\nWeider was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to Louis and Anna Weider, Polish Jewish emigrants from the town of Kurów, Poland. He published the first issue of \"Your Physique\" magazine in 1940, and built a set of barbells out of car wheels and axles the same year out of the family garage on Coloniale Street in Montreal. He designed numerous training courses beginning in the 1950s, including the Weider System of Bodybuilding.\n\nHe married Hedwiges \"Vicky\" Uzar; together they had one child, Lydia Ross (mother to Weider's three grandchildren), and subsequently divorced in 1960. During his marriage to Vicky Uzar he had met Betty Brosmer, who was then the highest-paid pin-up girl in the U.S. In 1961 Joe and Betty married, and she began working alongside him as Betty Weider. Betty and Joe together authored books on bodybuilding. Joe and Ben together were the co-founders of the International Federation of BodyBuilders.\n\nThe family founded Weider Nutrition in 1936, considered the first sports nutrition company. Now called Schiff Nutrition International, they were the creators of Tiger's Milk nutrition bars and related products, one of the earliest lines of sports foods.\n\nIn 1953, \"Your Physique\" was renamed \"Muscle Builder\" magazine. The name changed again to \"Muscle & Fitness\" in 1980. Other magazines published by Weider's publishing empire included \"Mr. America\", \"Muscle Power\", \"Shape magazine\", \"Fit Pregnancy\", \"Men's Fitness\", \"Living Fit\", \"Prime Health and Fitness\", \"Cooks\", \"Senior Golfer\", and \"Flex\", in addition to the more risque \"Jem\" Magazine and \"Monsieur\". The last two publications caused at least two clashes with obscenity laws. Weider has written numerous books, including \"The Weider System of Bodybuilding\" (1981), and co-wrote the 2006 biography \"Brothers Of Iron\" with Ben Weider. In 1983, Weider was named \"Publisher of the Year\" by The Periodical and Book Association. In 2003, his publication company, Weider Publications, was sold to American Media.\n\nIn 1972, Weider and his brother Ben found themselves a target of an investigation led by U.S. Postal Inspectors. The investigation involved the claims regarding their nutritional supplement Weider Formula No. 7. The product was a weight-gainer that featured a young Arnold Schwarzenegger on the label. The actual claim centered on consumers being able to \"gain a pound per day\" in mass. Following an appeal wherein Schwarzenegger testified, Weider was forced to alter his marketing and claims. Also in 1972, Weider encountered legal problems for claims made in his booklet \"Be a Destructive Self-Defense Fighter in Just 12 Short Lessons\".\n\nWeider was ordered to offer a refund to 100,000 customers of a \"five-minute body shaper\" that was claimed to offer significant weight loss after just minutes a day of use. The claims, along with misleading \"before and after\" photographs, were deemed false advertising by a Superior Court Judge in 1976.\n\nIn the 1980s, Weider found himself answering charges levied by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In 1984, the FTC charged that ads for Weider's Anabolic Mega-Pak (containing amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and herbs) and Dynamic Life Essence (an amino acid product) had been misleading. The FTC complaint was settled in 1985 when Weider and his company agreed not to falsely claim that the products could help build muscles or be effective substitutes for anabolic steroids. They also agreed to pay a minimum of $400,000 in refunds or, if refunds did not reach this figure, to fund research on the relationship of nutrition to muscle development.\n\nIn 2000, Weider Nutritional International settled another FTC complaint involving false claims made for alleged weight loss products. The settlement agreement called for $400,000 to be paid to the FTC and for a ban on making any unsubstantiated claims for any food, drug, dietary supplement, or program.\n\nWeider died of heart failure on March 23, 2013, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 93.\n\nOn Labor Day 2006, California governor and seven times Mr. Olympia winner Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Weider protégé, presented him with the Venice Muscle Beach Hall of Fame's Lifetime Achievement award. Schwarzenegger credited Weider with inspiring him to enter bodybuilding and to come to the United States. That same year Joe and Ben received the lifetime achievement award by the Young Men's Hebrew Association.\n\nThe movie \"Bigger\" was released in 2018 focusing on the life of Joe Weider. Tyler Hoechlin plays Joe Weider, while Julianne Hough plays Betty Weider, his second wife. Aneurin Barnard plays the role of Ben Weider, Joe’s younger brother.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1978363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978363", "title": "History of the United States dollar", "text": "History of the United States dollar\n\nThe history of the United States Dollar refers to more than 240 years since the Continental Congress of the United States authorized the issuance of Continental Currency in 1775. On April 2, 1792, the United States Congress created the United States dollar as the country's standard unit of money. The term \"dollar\" had already been in common usage since the colonial period when it referred to eight-real coin (Spanish dollar) used by the Spanish throughout New Spain.\n\nAfter the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, the Continental Congress began issuing paper money known as Continental currency, or Continentals. Continental currency was denominated in dollars from $ to $80, including many odd denominations in between. During the Revolution, Congress issued $241,552,780 in Continental currency. By the end of 1778, this Continental currency retained only between to of its original face value. By 1780, Continental bills – or Continentals – were worth just of their face value. Congress tried to reform the currency by removing the old bills from circulation and issuing new ones, but this met with little to no success. By May 1781, Continentals had become so worthless they ceased to circulate as money. Benjamin Franklin noted that the depreciation of the currency had, in effect, acted as a tax to pay for the war. In the 1790s, after the ratification of the United States Constitution, Continentals could be exchanged for treasury bonds at 1% of face value.\n\nCongress appointed Robert Morris to be Superintendent of Finance of the United States following the collapse of Continental currency. In 1782, Morris advocated the creation of the first financial institution chartered by the United States. The Bank of North America was funded in part by bullion coin, loaned to the United States by France. Morris helped finance the final stages of the war by issuing promissory notes in his name, backed by his own money. The Bank of North America also issued notes convertible into gold or silver. On July 6, 1785, the Continental Congress of the United States authorized the issuance of a new currency, the US dollar.\n\nHowever, runaway inflation and the collapse of the Continental currency prompted delegates at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 to include the gold and silver clause in the United States Constitution, preventing individual States from issuing their own bills of credit. Article One states they were prohibited to \"make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.\" Some people use this clause to argue that federal paper money is unconstitutional.\n\nThe United States Mint was created by Congress following the passing of the Coinage Act of 1792. It was primarily tasked with producing and circulating coinage. The first Mint building was in Philadelphia, then the capital of the United States. The Mint was originally placed within the Department of State, until the Coinage Act of 1873 when it became part of the Department of the Treasury (in 1981 it was placed under the auspices of the Treasurer of the United States). The Mint had the authority to convert any precious metals into standard coinage for anyone's account with no seigniorage charge beyond refining costs.\n\nAfter the creation of the U.S. dollar, the fledgling American administration of President George Washington turned its attention to monetary issues again in the early 1790s, under the leadership of Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury at the time. Congress acted on Hamilton's recommendations, with the Coinage Act of 1792 that established the dollar as the basic unit of account for the United States. The word \"dollar\" is derived from Low Saxon cognate of the High German \"Thaler\". The most commonly circulated and readily available currency, used by common Americans, at this time, was the Spanish peso, also known as the \"Spanish milled dollar\", which was valued for its high silver content.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the intrinsic value of gold coins rose relative to their nominal equivalent in silver coins, resulting in the removal from commerce of nearly all gold coins, and their subsequent private melting. Therefore, in the Coinage Act of 1834, the 15:1 ratio of silver to gold was changed to a 16:1 ratio by reducing the weight of the nation's gold coinage. This created a new U.S. dollar that was backed by 1.50 grams (23.22 grains) of gold. However, the previous dollar had been represented by 1.60 g (24.75 grains) of gold. The result of this revaluation, which was the first devaluation of the U.S. dollar, was that the value in gold of the dollar was reduced by 6%. Moreover, for a time, both gold and silver coins were useful in commerce.\n\nIn 1853, the weights of U.S. silver coins (except the dollar itself, which was rarely used) were reduced. This had the effect of placing the nation effectively (although not officially) on the gold standard. The retained weight in the dollar coin was a nod to bimetallism, although it had the effect of further driving the silver dollar coin from commerce. Foreign coins, including the Spanish dollar, were also, widely used, as legal tender, until 1857.\n\nWith the enactment of the National Banking Act of 1863during the American Civil Warand its later versions that taxed states' bonds and currency out of existence, the dollar became the sole currency of the United States and remains so today.\n\nDuring the 19th century the dollar was less accepted around the world than the British pound. Nellie Bly carried Bank of England notes on her 1889–1890 trip around the world in 72 days; she also brought some dollars, Bly wrote, \"to use at different ports as a test to see if American money was known outside of America\". Traveling east from New York, she did not see American money until she found $20 gold pieces used as jewelry in Colombo; there Bly found that as currency dollars were accepted at a 60% discount.\n\nIn 1878, the Bland–Allison Act was enacted to provide for freer coinage of silver. This act required the government to purchase between $2 million and $4 million worth of silver bullion each month at market prices and to coin it into silver dollars. This was, in effect, a subsidy for politically influential silver producers.\n\nThe discovery of large silver deposits in the Western United States in the late 19th century created a political controversy. Due to the large influx of silver, the intrinsic value of the silver in the nation's coinage dropped precipitously. On one side were agrarian interests such as the Greenback Party that wanted to retain the bimetallic standard in order to inflate the dollar, which would allow farmers to more easily repay their debts. On the other side were Eastern banking and commercial interests, who advocated sound money and a switch to the gold standard. This issue split the Democratic Party in 1896. It led to the famous Cross of Gold speech given by William Jennings Bryan, and may have inspired many of the themes in \"The Wizard of Oz\". Despite the controversy, the status of silver was slowly diminished through a series of legislative changes from 1873 to 1900, when a gold standard was formally adopted. The gold standard survived, with several modifications, until 1971.\n\n\"Note: all references to 'ounce' in this section are to the troy ounce as used for precious metals, rather than to the (smaller) avoirdupois ounce used in the United States customary units system for other goods.\"\n\nBimetallism persisted until March 14, 1900, with the passage of the Gold Standard Act, which provided that:\n\n... the dollar consisting of twenty-five and eight-tenths grains of gold nine-tenths fine, as established by section thirty-five hundred and eleven of the Revised Statutes of the United States, shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard ...\n\nThus the United States moved to a gold standard, making both gold and silver the legal-tender coinage of the United States, and guaranteed the dollar as convertible to 25.8 grains (1.672 grams, 0.05375 troy ounces) of gold, or a little over $18.60 per ounce.\n\nThe gold standard was suspended twice during World War I, once fully and then for foreign exchange. At the onset of the war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts to Europe falling due, the dollar to (British) pound sterling exchange rate reached as high as $6.75:£1, far above the nominal (gold) parity of 4.8665:1. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, when the New York Stock Exchange closed and the gold standard was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange rate of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored when the New York Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.\n\nFor as long as the United States remained neutral in the war, it remained the only country to maintain its gold standard, doing so without restriction on import or export of gold from 1915 to 1917. When the United States became a belligerent in the war, President Wilson banned gold export, thereby suspending the gold standard for foreign exchange. After the war, European countries slowly returned to their gold standards, though in somewhat altered form.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, every major currency abandoned the gold standard. Among the earliest, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard in 1931 as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency notes or in settlement of debts, threatening the solvency of the British monetary system. This pattern repeated throughout Europe and North America. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced to raise interest rates in order to protect the gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.\n\nIn early 1933, in order to fight severe deflation, Congress and President Roosevelt implemented a series of Acts of Congress and Executive Orders which suspended the gold standard except for foreign exchange, revoked gold as universal legal tender for debts, and banned private ownership of significant amounts of gold coin. These acts included Executive Order 6073, the Emergency Banking Act, Executive Order 6102, Executive Order 6111, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 1933 Banking Act, House Joint Resolution 192, and later the Gold Reserve Act. These actions were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the \"Gold Clause Cases\" in 1935.\n\nFor foreign exchange purposes, the set $20.67 per ounce value of the dollar was lifted, allowing the dollar to float freely in foreign exchange markets with no set value in gold. This was terminated after one year. Roosevelt attempted first to restabilize falling prices with the Agricultural Adjustment Act; however, this did not prove popular, so instead the next politically popular option was to devalue the dollar on foreign exchange markets. Under the Gold Reserve Act the price of gold was fixed at $35 per ounce, making the dollar more attractive for foreign buyers (and making foreign currencies more expensive for those holding dollars). This change led to more conversion of gold into dollars, allowing the U.S. to effectively corner the world gold market.\n\nThe suspension of the gold standard was considered temporary by many in markets and in the government at the time, but restoring the standard was considered a low priority to dealing with other issues.\n\nUnder the post-World War II Bretton Woods system, all other currencies were valued in terms of U.S. dollars and were thus indirectly linked to the gold standard. The need for the U.S. government to maintain both a $35 per troy ounce (112.53cents/gram) market price of gold and also the conversion to foreign currencies caused economic and trade pressures. By the early 1960s, compensation for these pressures started to become too complicated to manage.\n\nIn March 1968, the effort to control the private market price of gold was abandoned. A two-tier system began. In this system all central-bank transactions in gold were insulated from the free market price. Central banks would trade gold among themselves at $35/ounce (112.53¢/g) but would not trade with the private market. The private market could trade at the equilibrium market price and there would be no official intervention. The price immediately jumped to $43/ounce (138.25¢/g). The price of gold touched briefly back at $35/ounce (112.53¢/g) near the end of 1969 before beginning a steady price increase. This gold price increase turned steep through 1972 and hit a high that year of over $70/ounce (2.25$/g). By that time floating exchange rates had also begun to emerge, which indicated the \"de facto\" dissolution of the Bretton Woods system. The two-tier system was abandoned in November 1973. By then the price of gold had reached $100/ounce (3.22$/g).\n\nIn the early 1970s, inflation caused by rising prices for imported commodities, especially oil, and spending on the Vietnam War that was not counteracted by cuts in other government expenditures, combined with a trade deficit to create a situation in which the dollar was worth less than the gold used to back it.\n\nIn 1971, President Richard Nixon unilaterally ordered the cancellation of the direct convertibility of the United States dollar to gold. This act was known as the Nixon Shock.\n\nThe sudden jump in the price of gold after the demise of the Bretton Woods accords was a result of the significant prior debasement of the US dollar due to excessive inflation of the monetary supply via central bank (Federal Reserve) coordinated fractional reserve banking under the Bretton Woods partial gold standard. In the absence of an international mechanism tying the dollar to gold via fixed exchange rates, the dollar became a pure fiat currency and as such fell to its free market exchange price versus gold. Consequently, the price of gold rose from $35/ounce (1.125 $/g) in 1969 to almost $500 (29 $/g) in 1980.\n\nShortly after the dollar price of gold started its ascent in the early 1970s, the price of other commodities such as oil also began to rise. While commodity prices became more volatile, the average price of oil as expressed in gold (or vice versa) remained much the same in the 1990s as it had been in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n\nFearing the emergence of a gold-based economy separate from central banking, and with the corresponding threat of the collapse of the U.S. dollar, the U.S. government approved several changes to the trading on the COMEX. These changes resulted in a steep decline in the traded price of precious metals from the early 1980s onward.\n\nUnited States silver certificates were a type of representative money printed from 1878 to 1964 in the United States as part of its circulation of paper currency. They were produced in response to silver agitation by citizens who were angered by the Fourth Coinage Act, and were used alongside the gold-based dollar notes. The silver certificates were initially redeemable in the same face value of silver dollar coins, and later in raw silver bullion.\n\nSince the early 1920s, silver certificates were issued in $1, $5, and $10 denominations. In the 1928 series, only $1 silver certificates were produced. Fives and tens of this time were mainly Federal Reserve notes, which were backed by and redeemable in gold. In 1933, Congress passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act which included a clause allowing for the pumping of silver into the market to replace the gold. A new 1933 series of $10 silver certificate was printed and released, but not many were released into circulation.\n\nIn 1934, a law was passed in Congress that changed the obligation on Silver Certificates so as to denote the current location of the silver.\n\nThe last government regulation regarding the silver standard was in 1963, when President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110, delegating to the Treasury Secretary his authority to authorize the US Department of Treasury to issue silver certificates for any silver held by the U.S. Government in excess of that not already backing issued certificates. This was necessary because of Kennedy's signing of Public Law 88-36 on the same day, one of the effects of which was a repeal of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934-this act had authorized the Treasury Secretary to purchase silver bullion and issue silver certificates against it. Silver certificates continued to be issued for a short period of time in the $1 denomination, but were discontinued in late 1963.\n\nWorld War II devastated European and Asian economies while leaving the United States' economy relatively unharmed. As European governments exhausted their gold reserves and borrowed to pay the United States for war material, the United States accumulated large gold reserves. This combination gave the United States significant political and economic power following the war.\n\nThe Bretton Woods agreement codified this economic dominance of the dollar after the war. In 1944, Allied nations sought to create an international monetary order that sustained the global economy and prevented the economic malaise that followed the First World War. The Bretton Woods agreement laid the foundations for an international monetary order that created rules and expectations for the international economic system. It created the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the predecessor of the World Bank, and an international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates. It valued the dollar at $35 per ounce of gold and the remaining signatories pegged their respective currency relative to the dollar, leading some economists to argue that Bretton Woods \"dethroned\" gold as the default asset.\n\nWhile Bretton Woods institutionalized the dollar's importance following the war, Europe and Asia faced dollar shortages. The international community needed dollars to finance imports from the United States to rebuild what was lost in the war. In 1948 Congress passed the European Recovery Program - generally known as the Marshall Plan – giving dollars to European countries to purchase imports needed to rebuild their economies. The plan helped European countries by providing them dollars to purchase the imports needed to produce exports, eventually allowing the countries to export enough of their own goods to obtain the dollars necessary to sustain their economies without reliance on any Marshall-like plan. At the same time, Joseph Dodge worked with Japanese officials and Congress to pass the Dodge Plan in 1949, which worked similarly to the Marshall Plan, but for Japan rather than Europe.\n\nThe Marshall and Dodge plans' successes have brought new challenges to the U.S. dollar. In 1959, dollars in circulation around the world exceeded U.S. gold reserves, which became vulnerable to the equivalent of a bank run. In 1960, Yale economist Robert Triffin described the problem to Congress: either the dollar was not freely available and other countries could not afford to import American goods, or the dollar was freely available but confidence that the dollar could be converted to gold would wane.\n\nEventually, the United States chose to devalue the dollar. During the early 1960s American officials largely prevented the conversion of dollars to gold with a series of \"gentlemanly\" agreements and other policies – which included the London Gold Pool - but these actions were not sustainable; the danger of a run on U.S. gold reserves was too high. With Nixon's election in 1968, American officials became increasingly concerned until Nixon finally issued Executive Order 11615 in August 1971, ending the direct convertibility of dollars to gold. He said, \"We must protect the position of the American dollar as pillar of monetary stability around the world ... I am determined that the American dollar must never again be hostage in the hands of the international speculators.\" This became known as the Nixon Shock and marked the dollar's transition from the gold standard to a fiat currency.\n\nThe United States enjoys some benefits because the dollar serves as the international reserve currency. The United States is less likely to face a balance of payments crisis.\n\nA United States Note, also known as a Legal Tender Note, was a type of paper money that was issued from 1862 to 1971 in the U.S. Having been current for over 100 years, they were issued for longer than any other form of U.S. paper money. They were known popularly as \"greenbacks\" in their day, a name inherited from the Demand Notes that they replaced in 1862.\n\nWhile issuance of United States Notes ended in January 1971, existing United States Notes are still valid currency in the United States today, though rarely seen in circulation.\n\nBoth United States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes are parts of the national currency of the United States, and both have been legal tender since the gold recall of 1933. Both have been used in circulation as money in the same way. However, the issuing authority for them came from different statutes. United States Notes were created as fiat currency, in that the government has never categorically guaranteed to redeem them for precious metal - even though at times, such as after the specie resumption of 1879, federal officials were authorized to do so if requested.\n\nThe difference between a United States Note and a Federal Reserve Note is that a United States Note represented a \"bill of credit\" and was inserted by the Treasury directly into circulation free of interest. Federal Reserve Notes are backed by debt purchased by the Federal Reserve, and thus generate seigniorage for the Federal Reserve System, which serves as a lending intermediary between the Treasury and the public.\n\nToday, like the currency of most nations, the dollar is fiat money, unbacked by any physical asset. A holder of a federal reserve note has no right to demand an asset such as gold or silver from the government in exchange for a note. Consequently, some proponents of the intrinsic theory of value believe that the near-zero marginal cost of production of the current fiat dollar detracts from its attractiveness as a medium of exchange and store of value because a fiat currency without a marginal cost of production is easier to debase via overproduction and the subsequent inflation of the money supply.\n\nIn 1963, the words \"PAYABLE TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND\" were removed from all newly issued Federal Reserve notes. Then, in 1968, redemption of pre-1963 Federal Reserve notes for gold or silver officially ended. The Coinage Act of 1965 removed all silver from quarters and dimes, which were 90% silver prior to the act. However, there was a provision in the act allowing some coins to contain a 40% silver consistency, such as the Kennedy Half Dollar. Later, even this provision was removed, with the last circulating silver-content halves minted in 1969. All coins previously minted in silver for general circulation are now clad. During 1982, the composition of the cent was changed from copper to zinc with a thin copper coating. The content of the nickel has not changed since 1866 (except for 1942-1945 when silver and other metals were used to preserve nickel for war uses). Silver and gold coins are produced by the U.S. government, but only as non-circulating commemorative pieces or in sets for collectors.\n\nAll circulating notes, issued from 1861 to present, will be honored by the government at face value as legal tender. This means that the federal government will accept old notes as payments for debts owed to the federal government (taxes and fees), or exchange old notes for new ones, but will not redeem notes for gold or silver, even if the note states that it may be thus redeemed. Some bills may have a premium to collectors.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is the $10,000 gold certificate of Series 1900, a number of which were inadvertently released to the public because of a fire in 1935. This set is not considered to be \"in circulation\" and, in fact, is stolen property. However, the government canceled these banknotes and removed them from official records. Their value, relevant only to collectors, is approximately one thousand US dollars.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, there is $1.2 trillion in total US currency in worldwide circulation as of July 2013.\n\nThe federal government began issuing paper currency during the American Civil War. As photographic technology of the day could not reproduce color, it was decided the back of the bills would be printed in a color other than black. Because the color green was seen as a symbol of stability, it was selected. These were known as \"greenbacks\" for their color and started a tradition of the United States' printing the back of its money in green. The author of that invention was chemist Christopher Der-Seropian. In contrast to the currency notes of many other countries, Federal Reserve notes of varying denominations are the same colors: predominantly black ink with green highlights on the front, and predominantly green ink on the back. Federal Reserve notes were printed in the same colors for most of the 20th century, although older bills called \"silver certificates\" had a blue seal and serial numbers on the front, and \"United States notes\" had a red seal and serial numbers on the front.\nIn 1928, sizing of the bills was standardized (involving a 25% reduction in their current sizes, compared to the older, larger notes nicknamed \"horse blankets\"). The Secretary of the Treasury directed a reduction in paper currency from a  inch by  inch size to a  inch by  inch (6.31' x 2.69') size, which allowed the Treasury Department to produce 12 notes per  inch by  inch sheet of paper that previously would yield 8 notes at the old size. Modern U.S. currency, regardless of denomination, is 2.61 inches (66.3 mm) wide, 6.14 inches (156 mm) long, and 0.0043 inches (0.109 mm) thick. A single bill weighs about fifteen and a half grains (one gram) and costs approximately 4.2 cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce.\n\nMicroprinting and security threads were introduced in the 1991 currency series.\n\nAnother series started in 1996 with the $100 note, adding the following changes:\nAnnual releases of the 1996 series followed. The $50 note followed on June 12, 1997, and introduced a large dark numeral with a light background on the back of the note to make it easier for people to identify the denomination. The $20 note in 1998 introduced a new machine-readable capability to assist scanning devices. The security thread glows green under ultraviolet light, and \"USA TWENTY\" and a flag are printed on the thread, while the numeral \"20\" is printed within the star field of the flag. The microprinting is in the lower left ornamentation of the portrait and in the lower left corner of the note front. , the $20 note was the most frequently counterfeited note in the United States. The new design of the $5 and $10 notes were released in 2000.\n\nMay 13, 2003, The Treasury announced that it would introduce new colors into the $20 bill, the first U.S. currency since 1905 (not counting the 1934 gold certificates) to have colors other than green or black. The move was intended primarily to reduce counterfeiting, rather than to increase visual differentiation between denominations. The main colors of all denominations, including the new $20 and $50, remain green and black; the other colors are present only in subtle shades in secondary design elements. This contrasts with notes of the euro, Australian dollar, and most other currencies, where strong colours are used to distinguish each denomination from the other.\n\nThe new $20 bills entered circulation October 9, 2003, the new $50 bills, September 28, 2004. The new $10 notes were introduced in 2006 and redesigned $5 bills began to circulate March 13, 2008. Each will have subtle elements of different colors, though will continue to be primarily green and black. The Treasury said it will update Federal Reserve notes every 7 to 10 years to keep up with counterfeiting technology. In addition, there have been rumors that future banknotes will use embedded RFID microchips as another anti-counterfeiting tool.\n\nThe 2008 $5 bill contains significant new security updates. The obverse side of the bill includes patterned yellow printing that will cue digital image-processing software to prevent digital copying, watermarks, digital security thread, and extensive microprinting. The reverse side includes an oversized purple number 5 to provide easy differentiation from other denominations.\n\nOn April 21, 2010, the U.S. Government announced a heavily redesigned $100 bill that featured bolder colors, color shifting ink, microlenses, and other features. It was scheduled to start circulating on February 10, 2011, but was delayed due to the discovery of sporadic creasing on the notes and \"mashing\" (when there is too much ink on the paper, the artwork on the notes are not clearly seen). The redesigned $100 bill was released October 8, 2013. It costs 11.8 cents to produce each bill.\n\n\"The soundness of a nation's currency is essential to the soundness of its economy. And to uphold our currency's soundness, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender and counterfeiting must be effectively thwarted,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said at a ceremony unveiling the $20 bill's new design. Prior to its current design, the most recent redesign of the U.S. dollar bill was in 1996.\n\nAs a result of a 2008 decision in an accessibility lawsuit filed by the American Council of the Blind, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 and the current version of the $100 bill. It also plans larger, higher-contrast numerals, more color differences, and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period. In 2016, the Treasury announced a number of design changes to the $5, $10 and $20 bills; to be introduced in this next redesign. The redesigns include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1978364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978364", "title": "Coffee cup", "text": "Coffee cup\n\nA coffee cup is a container that coffee and espresso-based drinks are served in. Coffee cups are typically made of glazed ceramic, and have a single handle for portability while the beverage is hot. Ceramic construction allows a beverage to be drunk while hot, providing insulation to the beverage, and quickly washed with cold water without fear of breakage, compared to typical glassware.\n\nA coffee cup may also be a disposable cup in which hot beverages, including coffee, can be contained. Disposable coffee cups may be made out of paper or polystyrene foam. At coffee shops, paper cups are commonly used to give beverages to customers on the go, usually with a coffee cup sleeve to provide insulation against heat transferred through the container.\n\nA new alternative trend sees consumers purchasing reusable coffee cups instead of disposable cups as a more sustainable approach to coffee consumption becomes more popular. These can include bamboo cups, americano cups made from polypropylene as well as other organic materials such as starch and paper pulp. Research shows that only 1 in 400 single-use cups are recycled and media coverage has encouraged consumers to look for alternatives \n\nIn the past, other materials which have been used to make coffee cups are carved bone, clay, wood, strengthened glass, metal, ceramic and porcelain.\n\nUsually made of plastic, the first patent for a coffee cup lid design was filed in 1967, and focused on creating a tight seal between the cup and the lid to reduce leaking and a vent hole to allow steam to escape. However, there was no opening for drinking, and the consumer would have to tear into the lid. In 1986, the Solo Traveler lid was created; it is found in the Museum of Modern Art's 2004 exhibit \"Humble Masterpieces\". Recent lid designs like the Viora have improved on Solo Traveler's design, which has too small a vent to allow sufficient air to enter while drinking. Louise Harpman, co-owner of the world's largest collection of coffee cup lids and co-author of the book Coffee Lids (Princeton Architectural Press, 2018), suggests that coffee cup lids \"represent a major shift in American 'to-go' culture\".\n\nThere are cafe cups in various sizes, standardized to reflect paper cup sizes. There are even cafe cups for people who spend their time traveling. They are typically 225, 336, 460 and sometimes 570 ml. Slight variation is to be expected among various coffeehouses, but these sizes are the standard. These are the cups that house mochas, lattes, and other coffee drinks. These cups are also made of porcelain and shaped to encourage and aid in creating latte art.\n\nThe cappuccino is served in its own cup, a 171 ml porcelain cup served on an accompanying saucer. The size of the cup reflects the traditional cappuccino, a drink with a 1:1:1 ratio. 57 ml espresso, 57 ml steamed milk, 57 ml integrated foam.\n\nThe Demitasse is a cup specially crafted for espresso. It is 60-80 ml in capacity, and usually served on a saucer. The traditional macchiato: 2 shots of espresso and a dollop of foam is also served in the demitasse, on an accompanying saucer.\n\nThe \"Gibraltar\" or cortado is served in a 115 ml rocks glass.\n\nNASA designed \"Space Cups\" for use by astronauts in the International Space Station. The specially-shaped coffee cups, which are 3D printed, can be used to replace the old method of drinking liquids in space by sucking them out of a bag. The sharp inner corner of the Space Cup allows the liquid to flow toward the drinker's lips through capillary flow. The data from experiments conducted with Space Cups can be used to better the design of fluid systems used in space, such as toilets, oxygen, air conditioning, and water coolants. The data can also be applied to societal uses of fluid systems on Earth, such as improving the design of portable medical blood testers for infectious diseases.\n\nPorcelain allows for heat retention and crema preservation. However, porcelain cools down quickly due to air bubbles in the cup. Crema is the coffee foam at the top of a shot of espresso. Preserving it in cups allows for latte art to occur in milk based espresso drinks.\n\nCeramic is a general term for all clay materials excluding porcelain. It is a sturdier material than porcelain, and since the material is thicker the cup walls have better heat retention abilities. Ceramic is a preferred material when the coffee cup must be more robust and resistant to damage.\n\nPaper cups may be lined with wax or plastic to prevent leakage. The Anthora paper cup designed by Leslie Buck for the Sherri Cup Company in 1963 is recognized as an iconic part of New York City daily life. Unfortunately, the plastic-lined cups, although accepted by a few composting facilities, produce plastic fragments and contaminate the ecosystems where they are processed. Once the plastic contaminates the environment, it has not shown to biodegrade, and after a lot of accumulation it will be nearly impossible to clean up.\n\nBamboo coffee cups, promoted as a \"natural\" product, are made of powdered bamboo fibres suspended in a glue containing melamine and formaldehyde. German consumer group Stiftung Warentest has raised concerns that the use of these substances make such cups a health hazard when used for hot drinks.\n\nPolystyrene, sometimes known as styrofoam (not to be confused with the trademarked brand name Styrofoam), is used mostly because of its insulating abilities. The use of polystyrene is controversial in coffee cups and other containers because it is non-biodegradable, a major part of marine litter, difficult to recycle, and has various health risks. It is banned as a food and drink container in several U.S. cities including Portland, Ore.; San Francisco, Calif.; and Amherst, Mass. Many more cities are proposing banning the cups. The doughnut company and coffeehouse chain, Dunkin' Donuts, has been criticized for continuing to use styrofoam cups. The company has argued that there is no other material that is as insulated, and has an official statement about their foam cups on their website. However, they have begun phasing in doubled-walled paper cups designed to look like their signature foam cup.\n\nCoffee cup sleeves are roughly cylindrical sleeves that fit tightly over handle-less paper coffee cups to insulate the drinker's hands from hot coffee. The coffee sleeve was invented and patented by Jay Sorensen in 1993 and are now commonly utilized by coffee houses and other vendors that sell hot beverages dispensed in disposable paper cups. Coffee sleeves are typically made of textured paperboard, but can be found made of other materials.\n"}

Discovered by Louil Silas, Jr, Powell is best known for his hit \"You\" which peaked at #2 R&B and #10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Powell has released four studio albums to date (\"Jesse Powell\", \"'Bout It\", \"JP\", \"Jesse\"). He is the older brother of fellow contemporary R&B singers Trina & Tamara. Powell is credited with a four octave vocal range. He is a Grammy-nominee.\nPowell was born in Gary, Indiana and raised with his siblings Trina, Tamara and Jacob. The family performed in local talent shows, and in 1993, he attracted the attention of producer Carl Roland in Kansas City. Following an artist showcase, Louil Silas, Jr signed him to his Silas Records imprint. \n\nThree years later, he completed work on his debut album. His first single \"All I Need\" was written by Powell, Sam Salter and Laney Stewart and was released in March 1996. It received moderate airplay on BET and Urban stations, peaking at #32 on the Billboard R&B charts. His \"self-titled\" album was released on March 12, 1996, opening at #35 on the Billboard R&B and #32 on Heatseekers charts. A second single, a remake of the classic \"Gloria\" followed later that year and garnered Powell another charting single (#51 R&B).\n\nPowell then began work on his second album, debuting the lead single \"I Wasn't with It\" in 1998 which became his first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 (#85 US, #25 R&B). Bolstered by the success of the single, his sophomore album \"'Bout It\" was released on September 8, 1998, opening at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart (for artists who have yet to crack the Top 100 on the Billboard 200). The album experienced moderate sales at first, until the release of the set's second single. \"You\" was originally included on Powell's self-titled debut. However, it proved to be a favorite and was included on his \"'Bout It\" album and released as the second single in February 1999. It became his biggest (and signature) hit, peaking at #2 on the Billboard R&B chart and #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 (marking his first Top 10 hit). Sales of his second album gained steadily, and would eventually be certified gold by the RIAA, peaking at #15 on R&B and #63 on the Billboard 200 (moving him out of the Heatseekers chart as an artist). A third single \"'Bout It, 'Bout It\" would soon follow later that year, in addition to work on his third album.\n\nFollowing Silas Records merge into MCA Records, Powell's first release on the label would be the single \"If I\" in 2000, which would peak at #58 on the R&B chart. His third studio album \"JP\" was released on March 27, 2001, opening at #18 R&B and #71 on Billboard 200. A second single, \"Something in the Past\" (#67 R&B) would follow, in addition to Powell doing some promotion for the release. In 2002, he left the label and signed with Riviera Records. His fourth studio album \"Jesse\" was released on October 14, 2003 and was supported by the singles \"By the Way\" (#99 R&B) and \"Touching It Tonight,\" peaking at #85 on the Billboard R&B chart.

{"id": "1978393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978393", "title": "Petters Limited", "text": "Petters Limited\n\nPetters Limited (known as JB Petter & Sons of Yeovil until 1910), were a maker of stationary petrol and diesel engines from 1896 onwards. In 1915 Petter founded Westland Aircraft Works (renamed \"Westland Aircraft\" in 1935). In 1986 Petters Limited merged with one-time rival R A Lister and Company to form Lister Petter.\n\nJames Bazeley Petter, an agricultural engineer and iron founder, had premises in the Borough, Yeovil. It was there that Ernest and Percival, his twin sons, designed and built a self-propelled oil engine in 1892. Three years later they designed the first internal combustion engined motor car to be made in the United Kingdom. The car, using a converted four-wheel horse-drawn phaeton and a 3 hp (2 kW) twin-cylinder horizontal oil engine, had a top speed of . The vehicle was constructed at the Park Road carriage works of Hill and Boll. It weighed 9 cwt (457 kg) including the 120 lb (55 kg) of the Petter engine with its flywheel and side bars.\n\nA contemporary report said:\n\nThe twins continued to develop vehicles, the twelfth of which they entered to a competition at Crystal Palace in 1897, without success.\n\nPercival Petter, who in 1893 took over as manager of the Yeovil Foundry and Engineering Works, together with B. J. Baker, in 1894 designed and built first the Yeovil Engine, a high-speed steam engine. The following year he designed and built a small 2.5 hp oil engine for agricultural use that was immediately successful and the enterprise expanded, with Jacobs becoming chief engineer - a position he held until his death in 1936 - such that by 1904 over a thousand Petter oil engines were sold, ranging in capacity from 1 hp to 30 hp.\n\nIn parallel with these efforts in 1902 Petter and Jacobs created the first agricultural tractor, powered by a 30 hp oil engine.\n\nBy 1908 sales had increased principally against very large orders from Russia where two-stroke engines were preferred.\n\nIn 1911 the company, whose machines now ranged from 70 hp to 300 hp, won the Gran Prix at the Milan International Exhibition, and production hovered around 1,500 per annum.\n\nPetter Standard oil engines were horizontal open crank engines made to very high standards, which was put into production underway under the same year but around 1903 cheap American imports arrived disrupting the British market, including the newly created J. B. Petter Company Limited. Highly competitive US-manufactured engines like those manufactured by the Fairbanks Morse Company \"Jack of all Trades\" threatened the nascent British industry but unlike most British engine manufacturers Petter reacted by creating a new low-cost engine, the Petter Handyman. Costing approximately 80% of the Petter Standard and available only in batches of 50 or more units for more economic production, the young company's market position was preserved for the next two decades, enabling Petters to produce both two-stroke and four-stroke engines from 1920.\n\nPetters models as the M-type and the A-type were highly successful and were competitors for Lister's D-Type.\n\nThe last two-stroke design was the \"SS\" introduced in 1938, available in two- to six-cylinder versions delivering 125 hp-375 hp. The SS designation stood for \"superscavenge\", the design employing the Kadenacy principle to charge the cylinders. The exhaust gases left the cylinder at sufficiently high speed to create a partial vacuum, drawing air into the cylinder like a supercharger, while improved airflow cooled the valves and scavenging, this 'inertial' supercharging being supplemented by a blower.\n\nRunning at low temperatures due to a patented oil-cooled piston, and featuring a spherical small end bearing, they were used in British Rail 15107 and British Rail Class D3/14 locomotives.\n\n Bore 8.5 inch (216 mm)\nIn the railway locomotives, the SS4 was uprated to 360 BHP.\n\nSome Petter manuals are available for download at Internal Fire – Museum of Power.\n\nPetter models included the two-stroke M-type (petrol), the S-type (stationary diesel) and the A- and A1 (air-cooled) - the only noticeable difference between the last two being the position of the magneto (in the type A it protrudes; in the type A1 it is tucked away below), and an economy 'handyman' version of the M-type, and a comprehensive range of air-cooled diesels that included the PAZ1, AVA range, and the 3.5 hp AA1.\n\nIn 1912 the company went public and began engine production in a new factory named the \"Nautilus Works\" (after the fire grates that had made James Petter's fortune) in Reckleford.\nIts workforce of 500 men produced 1500 engines a year. \nPetters was renamed Vickers-Petters Ltd after it bought the former Vickers factory in Ipswich in 1920 but that part of the business was renamed Petters (Ipswich) in 1927. The Ipswich factory was closed by mid 1929 and the Ipswich works and land sold.\n\nPetters joined the Associated British Oil Engine Company in 1937. After the war the group was obtained by British Electrical Group, with Petter spun off in 1949 joining another engine manufacturer, J&H McLaren & Co., at the old Lagonda works in Egham Hythe near Staines, Middlesex, employing over 1,000 people at its peak. In 1957 the company was acquired by Hawker Siddeley and some production was moved to Hamble as the reorganized company was split into four groups within Hawker Siddeley Brush Group—Petter Staines (small engines), Petter Generator Divisions, Petter Marine Division, Petter Service Division and Thermo-King Division (building refrigeration units under license from the US firm Thermo-King). In 1984 Petter was merged with Lister to form Lister Petter Co. Ltd.

The entire island's natural scenery and wildlife is protected as it is part of the Bering Sea unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe island has a land area of , making it the 43rd largest island in the United States. Its most southerly point is Cape Upright which features cliff faces which exceed . Similar heights are found at Glory of Russia Cape on the north, and the highest point, above sea level, lies south from the island center.\n\nThere is a small island off its northwestern point called Hall Island. The wide sound between both islands is called Sarichef Strait. A small rocky islet called Pinnacle Rock lies to the south of Saint Matthew Island.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard maintained a manned LORAN station on the island during the 1940s.\n\nThe climatic conditions in the entire Bering Sea Area, according to National Climatic Data Center (1986) is reported as maritime with \"considerable wind and cool, humid and cloudy conditions\" with mean annual temperature of and annual precipitation of , in the St Mathews Island. The geological formation recorded in St. Mathew Island consists of calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of Late Cretaceous and earliest tertiary age with Pergelic Cryaquolls and Pergelic Cryoborolls soil types.\n\nThe first recorded attempt at settlement occurred in 1809, when a Russian group led by Demid Ilyich Kulikalov, under the guise of the Russian-American Company, established an experimental outpost.\n\nA 2013 sailing expedition to the island showed that, in spite of the lack of human habitation, extensive areas of beach were heavily contaminated with plastic marine debris, particularly from the fishing industry.\n\nPresently, Arctic foxes and insular voles are the only mammals resident on the island, though polar bears occasionally visit via pack ice. Notably, St. Matthew Island represents the southern limit of the range of polar bears in the Bering Sea.\n\nIn 1944, 29 reindeer were introduced to the island by the United States Coast Guard to provide an emergency food source. The Coast Guard abandoned the island a few years later, leaving the reindeer. Subsequently, the reindeer population rose to about 6,000 by 1963 and then died off in the next two years to 42 animals. A scientific study attributed the population crash to the limited food supply in interaction with climatic factors (the winter of 1963–64 was exceptionally severe in the region). By the 1980s, the reindeer population had completely died out. Environmentalists see this as an issue of overpopulation. For example, ecologist Garrett Hardin cited the \"natural experiment\" of St. Matthew Island of the reindeer population explosion and collapse as a paradigmatic example of the consequences of overpopulation in his essay \"An Ecolate View of the Human Predicament\".\n\nThere are two major lakes on the island, North Lake and Big Lake. The lakes contain a greater number of fish species (at least 5) than other nearby islands.\n\nLichen studies were conducted on the island in the 1990s to prepare a list of lichens with their habitat, composition and distribution pattern. These studies were considered important for characterizing the eating habits of caribou and air quality. The vegetation of the islands has been classified as wet, moist and alpine tundra, based on landforms and drainage patterns. The plant communities were attributed to five categories. In the area of rock rubble fields and high ridges the vegetation was mainly crustacean lichens. Among the 148 lichen species of the islands, 125 showed the Arctic–alpine geographic distribution, 74 boreal, 18 were coastal, 9 amphi-Berengian and 41 widespread, with many species falling into more than one category. The lichen diversity was characterized by wide-ranging Arctic–alpine and boreal species; it was evaluated as luxuriant that was linked to reindeer species disappearing from the area.\n\n"}

{"id": "1978429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978429", "title": "Bushey railway station", "text": "Bushey railway station\n\nBushey is a railway station in Hertfordshire which serves the towns of Bushey and Oxhey. It is situated on the West Coast main line, north of Harrow & Wealdstone, on an embankment. North of the station, the railway crosses the Colne valley on several viaducts.\nThe station is served by London Northwestern Railway semi-fast trains on the West Coast main line, and by London Overground services on the Watford DC Line, a slow local service along the West Coast route. At Bushey, this branches west on a loop to serve Watford High Street railway station, before rejoining the main line at Watford Junction.\n\nThe London and Birmingham Railway, the first main line railway in the United Kingdom, first ran through here on 20 July 1837. A station was not initially provided, as the area was then sparsely populated.\n\nA station was provided later in a similar red brick style to others along the route, larger than most although smaller than that at Harrow & Wealdstone. London Underground's Bakerloo line trains served the station from 16 April 1917 until 24 September 1982.\n\nDuring the war years of 1939-1945 the station was often known as \"Ampersand\" - this was due to a typically bureaucratic application of emergency regulations. To hinder enemy troops in the event of an invasion it was ordered that all station names should be painted out on station name-boards, and this was interpreted at Bushey & Oxhey to mean the words 'Bushey' and 'Oxhey' but not the '&'. For the duration of the war, therefore, the station bore the designation '&'. Also during wartime a concrete pillbox (a small gun fortification) was provided under the viaduct, between platforms 2 and 3.\n\nThe station was renamed from \"Bushey & Oxhey\" to \"Bushey\" on 6 May 1974, even though it is actually sited in the neighbouring town of Oxhey, and the nearest part of Bushey (Bushey Village) is over away. Even so, it was late in the 1980s before signage at the station reflected this change.\n\nOn 16 February 1980, faulty trackwork caused nine coaches of an express London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly passenger train to derail as it passed through the station. Three coaches were overturned and 19 passengers were seriously injured. The track required extensive repairs and did not reopen fully until 25 February 1980. The little used platform 3 was extensively damaged in the accident and remained closed until 2011.\n\nOn 20 April 1980, a passenger train heading for derailed immediately before Bushey station after hitting track maintenance machinery. The leading bogie of the Class 310 EMU derailed, but the train remained upright and damage was slight. One member of the track maintenance team sustained a broken pelvis.\n\nOn 8 August 1996, the Watford rail crash occurred around north of the station.\n\nThe local London Overground DC service that loops to the west to serve Watford High Street before Watford Junction makes platforms 1 & 2 curve away from the main line route. There are four main line platforms: one for the down (northbound) fast line (platform 3), two for the up (southbound) fast and the down (northbound) slow lines (platforms 4 & 5) which form an island platform; one serving the up (southbound) slow line (platform 6). \n\nPlatforms 3 and 4 are by far the least used, since these fast main line tracks are normally used by trains not stopping at Bushey. Platform 3 is accessed via the stairway for platform 2 and is fitted with a remotely operated gate to prevent access when the platform is not in operation. Platforms 3 and 4 were brought back into use for the December 2011 timetable, which marks some services as \"front four coaches only for Bushey\", allowing an improved late evening and weekend connection with London. Prior to this reinstatement, engineering works frequently meant that late-evening London Midland services could not stop at Bushey as a northbound platform was not available. It was overgrown after having fallen into disuse many years earlier and boarded off following its partial destruction during the crash of February 1980: the locomotive and leading two coaches passed through the station before coming to a stand having destroyed the platform face.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, a storage yard and redundant buildings were converted into a high-voltage substation to supply the significantly higher current required for the new, higher speed, Pendolino express trains.\n\nStarting in December 2007, Transport for London began a significant upgrade programme at the station. During the following four years, the underpass was relined with plasterboard walls and corrugated steel ceilings and repainted. The doors and windows were repainted, and the orange railings replaced the old green and blue railings.A non-slip surface had been added to areas of the floor and all of the stairways. Extensive CCTV was installed throughout and signage was changed to London Overground standards (allegedly \"temporary\"), as at other Overground stations. The alleyway linking the entrance of the station to Kingsfield Road was upgraded, replacing the repeatedly vandalised wooden fences with metal palisade. The level access from Platform 1 to the Kingsfield Road footpath was closed permanently. The bicycle shed was moved from the front of the station on Pinner Road to the Eastbury Road entrance. The space at the front was converted to a shop and newsagents which is soon to be made into a WHSmith.\n\nBushey is located on both the London Overground Watford DC Line and the West Coast Main Line. Services at the station are operated by both London Overground and London Northwestern Railway. Off-peak services at the station in trains per hour are:\n\nLondon Overground\nThese services are operated by Class 378 and Class 710 EMUs.\n\nLondon Northwestern Railway \nThese services are usually operated by Class 350 or Class 319 (peak times only) EMUs.\n\nLondon Bus routes 142, 258, London Service Permit route 8 also serve the station and non-London Bus Routes 306, 306B, 602 and W19 serve the station.\n"}
{"id": "1978448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978448", "title": "History of Shrewsbury", "text": "History of Shrewsbury\n\nThe town of Shrewsbury in Shropshire, England, has a history that extends back at least as far as the year 901, but it could have been first settled earlier. During the early Middle Ages, the town was a centre of the wool trade, and this was a peak in its importance. During the Industrial Revolution, comparatively little development took place in the town, although it did serve as a significant railway town after the development of rail transport in the area. The town today retains much of its historic architecture.\n\nEvidence of Neolithic occupation dating back before 2,000BC of a religious form, was discovered in 2017 in the grounds of a church, the medieval Church of the Holy Fathers in Sutton, making it Britain's oldest place of worship.\n\nIt is believed the area of Shrewsbury was settled in the 5th century by refugees from the nearby Roman City of Wroxeter, but the first physical evidence dates from the 7th century Saxons who named the town \"Scrobbesbyrig\".\n\nShrewsbury was probably founded as a town in the 8th century by the Saxon rulers of Mercia, who needed a fortified burh to control the Severn river-crossing on the road between the burhs of Hereford and Chester. It replaced the large Roman fortified town of Viroconium Cornoviorum only 5 miles to the southeast at modern day Wroxeter. Unfortunately no records survive of the exact date of foundation. Shrewsbury comes from the Saxon name 'Scrobbesbyrig'. Within the river loop Roman coins and pottery have been found, potentially indicating either small scale settlement or a route across the meander. Natural fords existed across the River Severn near to the present day English and Welsh Bridges which would have permitted travel across the meander. The ford near the Welsh Bridge existed just downstream of where the bridge is today, where Water Lane in Frankwell meets the river (this lane being one of the town's most ancient street alignments). Where the English Bridge is, the confluence of the Rea Brook with the Severn creates a wide, shallow area of water which was readily fordable. It is here, where the present day street \"Coleham Head\" exists, that an island existed and is believed to be a possible site of early Saxon settlement.\n\nThe earliest written mention of the town existing is from the year 901, when it was described as being a city. At that time it was part of the Kingdom of Mercia and was an important border post between the Anglo-Saxons and the Britons in Wales. By the reign of Athelstan (925–939) coinage was being issued, indicating that the town was fortified at this point as having a mint at this time required by law that the location be fortified. It grew in stature quickly and became the county town of Shropshire by the beginning of the 11th century. By 1066, the mid-11th Century, the town consisted of more than 250 houses, and had four churches – St Chad's, St Mary's, St Alkmond's, and St Julian's, of which at least the first three were minsters.\n\nThe Normans built a wooden fort at Shrewsbury, but in 1069, an alliance of Welshmen and the men of Chester laid siege to it. A force led by Brian of Brittany and William fitz Osbern was sent to relieve the garrison, but before they arrived, the rebels had burned the town and dispersed. Roger de Montgomery, a relative of William the Conqueror, was created first Earl of Shrewsbury, and in 1074 began building a castle where the present Shrewsbury Castle is now, as well as founding the Abbey (1083). The castle was built on a defensive site occupying the only land entry into Shrewsbury, the rest of the town being enclosed by a loop in the River Severn. Later the settlement was walled for added protection, the remains of which can be found throughout the town, most notable remains of the wall are on the side of the town wall gardens along the river.\n\nThe centre of Shrewsbury is located in a meander of the River Severn and the town is located only 9 miles from the Welsh border. The town centre has a pronounced hill on the north side of the meander where the neck of the meander is, upon which sits the castle, though the present day castle dates from the 13th century. The original town probably only occupied the summit of the hill, but it was probably extended southwards in the 13th century, as the town received a grant in 1218 of murage, a toll to build town walls, the first in England. It also received one of the earliest grants of pavage in 1266, \"for paving the paving of the new market place\" removed from the churchyard of St Alkmund and St Juliana. There are many well-preserved half-timbered black-and-white houses here, among them the Abbot's House of c.1500 on Butcher Row, and Rowley's House (onetime home to the Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery) on Barker Street.\n\nThe town fell to Welsh forces led by Llywelyn the Great in 1215 and again in 1234; after both attacks the defences were greatly increased. In 1283 Edward I held a Parliament, the first to include a House of Commons, at Shrewsbury Abbey to decide the fate of Dafydd ap Gruffydd, the last free Welsh ruler of Wales. Dafydd was executed – hanged, drawn and quartered – for high treason in Shrewsbury.\n\nShrewsbury is often regarded as having reached its height in the late Middle Ages, in terms of its national and economic significance. This was largely down to its position as a centre of the woollen trade, being a centre for the finishing of Welsh cloth. Shrewsbury merchants bought cloth, which had been woven and fulled but not finished, such as friezes and plains, in Oswestry market. After finishing, much of it was sent by road to London for sale.\n\nLater, after the formation of the Church of England, it is believed that the town was offered the status of cathedral city by Henry VIII, as the part of a proposed \"Diocese of Shropshire\". Reputedly, the citizens of the town rejected this offer, preferring to remain a \"first of towns\", this being the source of the term \"Proud Salopian\", that refers to a resident proud of Shrewsbury the way it is.\n\nDuring the English Civil War, the town was a royalist stronghold and only fell to Parliament forces after they were let in by a traitor at the St Mary's Water Gate (now also known as Traitor's Gate). During this period (1640s and 50s) Richard Baxter the English Puritan church leader, (born at nearby Rowton in 1615) was an energetic campaigner for the establishment of a University, which would only have been the third in England, in Shrewsbury but insufficient funding prevented success.\n\nThe town has, historically, produced some significant food products, including the most popular recipe for Simnel cake and Shrewsbury Biscuits (or Shrewsbury Cakes), an often lemon flavoured biscuit, which were originally produced in a bakery in the centre of the town.\n\nThe town did not experience the same massive growth that other English towns experienced during the industrial revolution and few large factories grew up in the town. Despite this, the world's first iron-framed building, the Ditherington Flax Mill was built in the town in 1797. In fact, during the 1830s and 1840s, the town actually decreased in population – mainly due to the lack of good transport links and little industry. The railways, however, became a major employer by the end of the 19th century, as Shrewsbury became an important railway town. Today, the town is still not industrial and the railways no longer play such a major part in employing its people.\n\nThe town was very little bombed in World War II, the only deaths occurring in 1940 when a woman and two grandchildren were killed when a cottage was hit in Ellesmere Road, so many of its ancient buildings remain intact and there was little redevelopment during the 1960s and 1970s (which destroyed the character of many historic towns in the UK).\n\nThe town played a role in the Cold War, hosting a regional headquarters of the Royal Observer Corps (HQ 16 Group ROC) in the town until the Corps was dissolved in 1995. Located near the Abbey on Holywell Street, the protected and atomic-bomb hardened Nuclear reporting blockhouse was jointly built by the Home Office and MOD in 1962 and operated continuously until 1992, and is now a veterinary practice.\n\nIt is known as the \"town of flowers\" and an alternative name is \"Salop\" (\"Salopia\" is the alternative name for the county).\n\nThe town had borough status for many centuries and it was run by the Corporation of Shrewsbury. Between 1974 and 2009 the two local authorities were Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council (the district level authority) and Shropshire County Council (the county level). Since 1 April 2009 however the town no longer has borough status and the sole local council is the county-wide unitary authority Shropshire Council. With this reorganisation, the town was parished and now has a town council.\n\n\n"}

The Partnership was founded in Waco, Texas, on March 23, 2005, by Prime Minister of Canada Paul Martin, President of Mexico Vicente Fox, and U.S. President George W. Bush. It was the second of such regional-level agreements involving the United States following the 1997 Partnership for Prosperity and Security in the Caribbean (PPS).\n\nSince August 2009 it is no longer an active initiative of any of the original dialogue partners. It has been largely superseded by the annual North American Leaders' Summit, an event that was established as part of SPP.\n\nThe initial SPP Working Groups were the Manufactured Goods and Sectoral and Regional Competitiveness Working Group, E-Commerce & ICT Working Group, Energy Working Group, Transportation Working Group, Food & Agriculture Working Group, Environment Working Group, Financial Services Working Group, Business Facilitation Working Group, Movement of Goods Working Group, Health, and Immigration.\n\nThese working groups were tasked with implementing the SPP as initiated by the North American Heads of Government and 30 CEOs of the largest corporations from each respective country on March 23, 2005. They were to consult with stakeholders; set specific, measurable, and achievable goals and implementation dates; and issue semiannual progress reports. A 24-month agenda was established to serve as a time line milestone to have the initial framework fully developed.\n\nThe stated goals of the SPP were cooperation and information sharing, improving productivity, reducing the costs of trade, enhancing the joint stewardship of the environment, facilitating agricultural trade while creating a safer and more reliable food supply, and protecting people from disease.\n\nNorth American Facilitation of Transportation, Trade, Reduced Congestion & Security (NAFTRACS) was a three-phase pilot project designed to focus on business processes and information as freight is transported from buyers to sellers. The project was intended to create a partnership between businesses and local, state, and federal governments while claiming to foster cooperation among the same entities.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, Canada's Minister of Finance Jim Flaherty, announced his government's 2008 budget, which included \"$29 million over two years to meet priorities under the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America\".\n\nThe North American Competitiveness Council (NACC) was an official tri-national working group of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP). It was created at the second summit of the SPP in Cancún, Quintana Roo, Mexico, in March 2006. Composed of 30 corporate representatives from some of North America's largest companies, the North American Competitiveness Council has been mandated to set priorities for the SPP and to act as a stable driver of the integration process through changes in government in all three countries.\n\nAs part of SPP, an annual trilateral summit was held between the leaders of the three countries. Following the cancellation of the SPP initiative in 2009, the summits continued as the North American Leaders' Summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, CNN anchor Lou Dobbs argued that the SPP was part of a plan to merge the United States, Canada, and Mexico into a North American Union similar to the European Union. At the time, Dobbs claimed that U.S. President Bush, who left office on January 20, 2009, was to have bypassed Congress and ultimately create a union based on a Texas highway corridor.\n\nThe Council of Canadians claimed that the SPP extended the controversial \"no fly list\" of the United States, made Canadian water a communal resource, and forced Canada and Mexico to adopt the United States' security policies—one of which would allow foreign military forces to neglect sovereignty in the case of a \"civil emergency\". It also touched on the issue of Albertan tar sands expansion to five times its current size.\n\nOn May 10, 2007, Conservative MP Leon Benoit, chair of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on International Trade, prevented University of Alberta professor Gordon Laxer from testifying that SPP would leave Canadians \"to freeze in the dark\" because \"Canada itself—unlike most industrialized nations—has no national plan or reserves to protect its own supplies\" by saying Laxer's testimony was irrelevant, defying a majority vote to overrule his motion, shutting down the committee meeting, and leaving with the other three out of four Conservative members; the meeting later continued presided by the Liberal vice-chair. After these disruptions, the \"National Post\" reported on a Conservative party manual to, among other things, usurp Parliamentary committees and cause chaos in unfavourable committees. The New Democratic Party also criticized SPP for being undemocratic, not open to Parliament, and opaque. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton described the process as not simply unconstitutional, but \"non-constitutional\", held completely outside the usual mechanisms of oversight.\n\nApproximately thirty U.S.-based organizations also sent an open letter to Congress on April 21, 2008, criticizing the secrecy and lack of any sort of democratic oversight:\n\"What differentiates the SPP from other security and trade agreements is that it is not subject to Congressional oversight or approval. The SPP establishes a corporate/government bureaucracy for implementation that excludes civil society participation. ... Facing a worrisome pact pushed forward in secrecy, it is time for Congress to halt this undemocratic approach and establish a process based on openness, accountability, and the participation of civil society.\n\nIn August 2009, the SPP website was updated to say: \"The Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP) is no longer an active initiative. There will not be any updates to this site\". Subsequent to this the website link does not connect and the cache website links do not work.\n\nThe NDP has called this a \"victory\" which is \"the result of the active and sustained efforts across the country, and across North America, of Canadian, Mexican, and American activists from the labour movement, civil society, progressive legislators and all those concerned and committed to build a better quality of life in our Canada and throughout North America\".\n\nOn February 4, 2011, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and U.S. President Barack Obama announced a new security and prosperity initiative with plans to \"pursue a perimeter approach to security in ways that support economic competitiveness, job creation, and prosperity\".\n\nOn March 13, 2011, the Canadian government announced it was beginning a five-week consultation process \"with all levels of government and with communities, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, as well as with our citizens on the implementation of the shared vision for perimeter security and economic competitiveness\".\n\n\nRelated infrastructure projects:\n\n"}

A declaration of the State of Emergency in Kenya on 20 October 1952 saw the detention of senior figures of the Kenya African Union's leadership, and Murumbi found himself thrust into the center of the party's leadership as its acting Secretary-General. He played a key role in securing legal counsel for the detainees arrested in the emergency crackdown, and, together with Pio Gama Pinto, raised objection to the continuance of British Imperial dominion in Kenya through Indian newspapers such as the \"Chronicle\".\n\nAfter Kenya became independent of British imperial rule in 1963, Murumbi participated in the writing of its first governmental constitution, and held the office of its Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1964 to 1966, touring the globe to set up numerous ambassadorial offices in foreign capitals for the newly created nation. He subsequently served as the Republic's Vice-President in a government led by Jomo Kenyatta in 1966 for nine months. However, around this time Murumbi became uneasy with what he perceived as Kenyatta's increasing authoritarianism in dealing with political opponents, and the increasing corruption that he witnessed rapidly developing within the new Kenyan Government order, and subsequently his concerns were borne out as when Kenyatta began to use government power to engage in land grabbing in the late 1960s and 1970s. Murumbi also became further alienated from the new Kenyan governing order when Pio Gama Pinto, a close personal friend and key political philosophical mentor of Murumbi's, was murdered in April 1965 after he had become a public critic of it. As Pheroze Nowrojee stated:\n\n\"The assassination of Pinto illustrated to Murumbi the shocking extent to which the new government had departed from its promises. His feeling, evidently, was that these were not the principles for which so many had suffered, and his departure (from the new political order in power) was only a matter of time.\"\n\nAfter resigning from the office of the Vice-President in November 1966 through what was announced officially at the time to be on account of ill health, Murumbi withdrew from politics.\n\nAfter leaving politics Murumbi became the Acting-Chairman of the Kenyan National Archives, and later co-founded 'African Heritage' with Alan Donovan, which went on to become the largest Pan-African art gallery on the continent.\n\nIn 1982 he seriously injured himself in a fall at his home, and was reliant upon a wheel-chair in his final years. He died on 22 June 1990 in his 79th year. Murumbi's body was buried in Nairobi City Park. The unmarked grave was subject to neglect, vandalism and theft through the late 1990s and early 2000s, and had at one time been threatened with being lost trace of altogether when a building development scheme was considered for the site of the grave, until it was protected by the creation around it of a memorial garden named after him.\n\nMurumbi married Shelia, a Librarian whom he met whilst he was a political exile from Kenya in England in the late 1950s. They lived in Kenya subsequently on an estate in the Muthaiga district. She died in 2000.\n\nHe was an avid art collector, and during his life acquired over 50,000 books and sheaves of official correspondence. The Kenya National Archives established a library containing some of the 8000 rare books (published before 1900) entrusted to them upon the death of Murumbi. The Kenya National Archives also created the 'Murumbi Gallery' within the same building, displaying the different African artifacts that were collected by him through his lifelife.\n\n"}

The two lakes are the Bhojtal (Upper Lake) & the Lower Lake, which lie to the west of the city center. The Bhojtal has an area of 31 km², and drains a catchment or watershed of 361 km². The watershed of the Bhojtal is mostly rural, with some urbanized areas around its eastern end. The lower lake has an area of 1.29 km². Its catchment is 9.6 km² and is mostly urbanized; the Lower Lake also receives subsurface seepage from the Bhojtal.\n\nThe Bhojtal was created by Paramara Raja Bhoj (1005-1055), ruler of Malwa. He established Bhopal (also named after him) to secure the eastern frontier of his kingdom. The lake was created by constructing an earthen dam across the Kolans River. The Kolans was formerly a tributary of the Halali River; with the creation of the Bhojtal and a diversion channel, the upper reach of the Kolans River and the Bhojtal now drain into the Kaliasot River. Bhadbhada dam was constructed in 1965 at the southeast corner of the Bhojtal; it now controls the outflow to the Kaliasot river.\n\nThe Lower Lake was created in 1794 by Nawab Chhote Khan, Minister of Nawab Hayath Mohammad Khan, to beautify the city. It is also contained behind an earthen dam, and drains into the Halali River via the lower reach of the Kolans River, presently known as the Patra Drain. Both the Kaliasot and Halali Rivers are tributaries of the Betwa River.\n\nThe lakes are home to a diverse flora and fauna, including many waterbirds. They have been designated a wetland of international importance under the international Ramsar Convention since August 2002.\n\n"}

(; born Luis Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga on January 22, 1901 in Viña del Mar, Chile – August 18, 1952 in Santiago, Chile), popularly known in Chile as Padre Hurtado (), was a Chilean Jesuit priest, lawyer, social worker, and writer, of Basque ancestry. He founded the Hogar de Cristo foundation in 1944. He was canonized on October 23, 2005, by Pope Benedict XVI, becoming his country's second saint.\n\nAlberto Hurtado Cruchaga was born in Viña del Mar, Chile, on January 22, 1901, to an aristocratic family. After the death of his father when Alberto was four years old, his mother, with just two small sons, decided to sell their large estate. Unfortunately the buyer defrauded her. The family, now impoverished, was forced to live with a succession of relatives. \n\nFrom an early age, Hurtado experienced what it meant to be poor and without a home. Thanks to a scholarship, he was able to attend the prestigious all-boys Jesuit school of St. Ignacio, Santiago, Chile (1909–17). During this time, he volunteered at the Parroquia Nuestra Señora de Andacollo, Santiago, a Catholic parish and school in a poor neighborhood of Santiago, where he assisted in the office and was librarian. From 1918 to 1923, he attended the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, studying in its law school and writing his thesis on labour law. After interrupting his studies for obligatory military service, he earned his degree in August 1923.\n\nHurtado entered the Jesuit novitiate in 1923. In 1925 he went to Córdoba, Argentina, where he studied humanities. In 1927 he was sent to Barcelona, Spain, to study philosophy and theology. When the Jesuits were suppressed in Spain in 1931, he continued his studies in theology at Louvain, Belgium. He was ordained a priest there on August 24,1933, and in 1935 he obtained a doctorate in pedagogy and psychology.\n\nBefore returning to Chile, Hurtado visited social and educational centers in Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. He returned to Chile in January 1936 and took up his post as professor of religion at Colegio San Ignacio and of Pedagogy at the Catholic University of Santiago. He was entrusted with the Sodality of Our Lady for the students, and he involved them in teaching catechism to the poor.\n\nConservative Catholics in Chile had difficulty accepting the Church's social teachings. As late as 1931, the official organ of the party aligned with the church hierarchy refused to publish the papal encyclical \"Quadragesimo anno\". When a group of clergy petitioned Archbishop José Horacio Campillo Infante to remove the editors, he refused, saying it was \"necessary to protect Catholics from the imprudent acts of the pope\".\n\nIn 1936, Hurtado authored an article entitled \"The Priesthood Crisis In Chile\", which addressed the problem of the shortage of priests in Chile; his analysis was criticized as 'exaggerated'. He criticized the quality of catechism instruction offered in Chile and wrote that young men often signed up as catechists but lacked the necessary certificate.\n\nIn 1940, Hurtado was appointed diocesan director of the Catholic Action youth movement and he served as its national director from 1941 to 1944. Also in 1941, Hurtado authored \"Is Chile a Catholic Country?\" The book published statistics demonstrating a lack of priests assigned to the working class and rural populations, and it reported on parishes that had one priest assigned to 10,000 laypeople spread across huge geographic areas. He advocated an increase in the number of priests and better education for them. Almost half of Chile's clergy were foreigners, including missionaries from the United States and Canada, who rode circuits of towns to administer the sacraments. Most Chileans regarded devotion to the Virgin and the saints as more important than attending Mass or receiving the Eucharist, which they could not do regularly.\n\nIn the book Hurtado published the results of a 1939 survey of Chilean religious practices and reported that only 9% of Chilean women and 3.5% of Chilean men regularly attended Mass. The book was heavily criticised by more conservative Catholics, who accused Hurtado of being a Communist.\n\nKeeping in mind his own origins, and ever grateful for the help he and his family had received when they were in great difficulties, Hurtado was led to active social involvement. His strong faith was transformed into action with his founding of an organization similar to Boys Town in the United States. His shelters, called \"Hogar de Cristo\" (Home of Christ), took in all children in need of food and shelter, abandoned or not. He also purchased a 1946 green pickup truck and monitored the streets at night to help those in need that he could reach. His own charisma brought him many collaborators and benefactors. The movement was a huge success. The shelters multiplied throughout Chile and it is estimated that between 1945 and 1951 more than 850,000 children received some help from the movement.\n\nIn 1947, Hurtado entered the labor movement. Inspired by the social teaching of the Church he founded the Chilean Trade Union Association, meant to train leaders and instill Christian values in the labor unions. He wrote three books: \"Social Humanism\" (1947), \"The Christian Social Order\" (1947) and \"Trade Unions\" (1950). He served as a confessor to the Falange Nacional, the precursor to the modern Christian Democratic Party. To disseminate the social teaching of the Church and help Christians reflect and act on the serious social problems faced by Chile, he founded in 1951 the periodical \"Mensaje\" (\"Message\"). He published numerous articles and books on labor issues in relation to the Catholic faith.\n\nDeeply spiritual, Hurtado was untiring in his work for the workers and the youth combining intellectual reflection and practical actions. Ever optimistic and joyful he had also an attractive personality that brought many people to Christ and the Church, young and old, intellectuals and manual workers.\n\nIn 1952, Hurtado was stricken with intense pain and rushed to hospital. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Day after day the media kept the country informed of Hurtado's state of health. Before his death he had become a national hero. After a brief battle with the illness, he died in Santiago.\nHurtado was beatified on October 16, 1994, by Pope John Paul II and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 23, 2005. St. Alberto was one of the first people to be elevated to sainthood during the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI; he was also the second Chilean saint, after Saint Teresa of Los Andes.\n\nHurtado is one of the most popular and cherished saints in his country, Chile. An indication of his lasting popularity was the presence in Saint Peter's Square, on the day of Hurtado's canonization, of a very large contingent of Chilean people, led by the highest authorities of the country, starting with President Ricardo Lagos and some high-ranking Chilean politicians who actually had been Father Hurtado's students during his school teacher time, like Senator Gabriel Valdés.\n\nMembers of the Conservative Party denounced what they saw as Hurtado's endorsement of the National Falange, a party founded after young social Catholics split from the conservative party. There were also attacks from the left. An anonymous article published in \"Policarpo\" in 1982 called Hurtado \"the last prophet of the bourgeoisie\" while it contrasts him unfavorably with the figure of Enrique Alvear who is hailed as the \"first Pastor of the Church of the poor in Chile\". Clotario Blest, who like Hurtado was also intellectually indebted to Fernando Vives, is reported to have distanced himself from Hurtado.\n\nDuring the 1990s there was a short TV series dedicated to him, named \"Crónica de un Hombre Santo\" (English: \"Chronicles of a Holy Man\"). Four actors portrayed Hurtado, from his childhood to his last years; popular telenovela actor Cristián Campos played the adult Hurtado during his ministry.\n\nHurtado remains very popular in Chile to this day. His Facebook fan page has more than 50,000 followers.\n\n\n\n\n\n "}

The name refers to the shape of the nearby bay in which the tides come and go through the narrow strait at Dun Manus and enter Camus bay at an angle. The explanation of the name sometimes given - 'cam uisce' or crooked water - is etymologically unsustainable. Camus residents are known by their nickname of Maicíní (the etymology of this word is unclear, although it was common in south Conamara to give each village nicknames).

The party is known for its Euroscepticism and opposes Slovenia's membership in NATO. It also opposes what it considers historical revisionism of events in Slovenia during World War II and to an extent is sympathetic towards the former Yugoslav government of Josip Broz Tito.\n\nAlthough the party usually refuses to position itself within a left–right political spectrum, its president Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti defined himself as leftist in a 2000 interview for the magazine \"Mladina\". However, the descriptions others have given the party range from left-wing to far-right, including right-wing. According to researchers at the University of Ljubljana, the SNS combines elements of right-wing and left-wing ideology and is not strictly a left-wing, nor a right-wing party, but nevertheless leans closer to the left. The party has been seen espousing more leftist economic policies (such as opposing privatization of key national enterprises), while maintaining right-wing social views, which at least partially explains the wide variance in placing it on the political spectrum.\n\nThe party's ideology has been strongly anti-clerical and has advocated a firm laicist position. The party is also opposed to gay rights. The party opposes the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The party opposes the introduction of a property tax and supports an increase in the minimum wage. The party has called for a change of the national flag and the coat of arms, feeling that they utilize symbols used by certain World War II paramilitary groups and lack a distinctly Slovenian historical character. The party supports replacing judges' lifetime mandate with an eight-year term. The party is opposed to Slovenia's membership the European Union and NATO.\n\nIts leaders have been accused of chauvinist and even racist attitudes towards certain minorities, particularly Slovenia's Romani population. In the early 1990s, the party campaigned against allowing refugees from former Yugoslav republics into the country. The party has since moderated its rhetoric, although its leaders continue to voice strongly anti-Croatian positions. Among other things, Jelinčič has proposed that four disputed villages; Bužini, Mlini, Škodelini and Škrile, be placed within the municipality of Piran for the purpose of participating in Slovenian elections. He also advocates improving relations with Serbia and has opposed the independence of Kosovo. The SNS frequently demands better treatment of Slovene minorities in neighboring countries.\n\nThe party was founded on 17 March 1991 by Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti, who remains the party's leader. The traditional 19th century Kozler map of United Slovenia is one of the official party symbols.\n\nIn 1993, dissenting factions broke from the party and formed the Slovenian National Right and the National Party of Labor. Many of the dissenting members were supporters of Slovene Home Guard and objected to Jelinčič's support of the Slovene Partisans. Another split occurred in 2008, when several Slovenian National Party MPs left the party and formed the party Lipa. These splits did not seriously affect the party's structure, even though the ideologies of both SNS MPs and the party's membership tend to sometimes differ from Jelinčič's stands.\n\nOn 9 March 2016, Jelinčič and Vojislav Šešelj, president of the Serbian Radical Party, signed an agreement with the intention of bringing their parties closer in terms of partnership and political alliance.\n\nIn the second democratic elections in Slovenia on 6 and 10 December 1992, the SNS received 10.2% of the vote and 12 of the 90 seats in parliament. On 10 November 1996, their share of the vote declined to 3.22% and the party won 4 seats. On 15 October 2000, the party's share of the vote increased to 4.38% and its seats in parliament remained steady at 4. On 3 October 2004, the party's share of the vote increased to 6.27% and the party won 6 seats in parliament. In Slovenian legislative elections on 21 September 2008, the party's share of the vote declined to 5.4% and its seats in parliament dropped to 5. In the Slovenian parliamentary election on 4 December 2011, the party received 1.80% of votes and lost its representation in parliament as it did not reach the parliamentary threshold of 4%. In the Slovenian parliamentary election on 13 July 2014, the party received 2.21% of votes, but did not win any seats in parliament. It receives support from various strands of society and has traditionally done well among young voters and residents of the regions near the Italian and Austrian borders.\n\nIn the 2002 presidential election, SNS leader Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti received 8.49% of the vote, placing third. In the 2007 presidential election, Jelinčič increased his share to 19.16% of the vote, but placed fourth.\n\nThe SNS received 5.02% of the vote in the 2004 European parliamentary election.

However, unlike termites, they do not consume wood, discarding a material that resembles sawdust. Sometimes, carpenter ants hollow out sections of trees. They also commonly infest wooden buildings and structures, and are a widespread nuisance and major cause of structural damage. Nevertheless, their ability to excavate wood helps in forest decomposition. One of the most familiar species associated with human habitation in the United States is the black carpenter ant (\"Camponotus pennsylvanicus\"). The genus includes over 1,000 species. They also farm aphids. In the farming, the ants protect the aphids while they excrete a sugary fluid called honeydew, which the ants get by stroking the aphids with their antennae.\n\nCarpenter ant species reside both outdoors and indoors in moist, decaying, or hollow wood, most commonly in forest environments. They cut \"galleries\" into the wood grain to provide passageways to allow for movement between different sections of the nest. Certain parts of a house, such as around and under windows, roof eaves, decks and porches, are more likely to be infested by carpenter ants because these areas are most vulnerable to moisture.\nCarpenter ants have been known to construct extensive underground tunneling systems. These systems often lead to an end at some food source – often aphid colonies, where the ants extract and feed on honeydew. These tunneling systems also often exist in trees. The colonies typically include a central \"parent\" colony surrounded and supplemented by smaller satellite colonies.\n\nCarpenter ants are considered both predators and scavengers. These ants are foragers that typically eat parts of other dead insects or substances derived from other insects. Common foods for them include insect parts, \"honeydew\" produced by aphids, or extrafloral nectar from plants. They are also known for eating other sugary liquids such as honey, syrup, or juices. Carpenter ants can increase the survivability of aphids when they tend them. They tend many aphid species but can also express preference for specific ones.\n\nMost species of carpenter ants forage at night. When foraging, they usually collect and consume dead insects. Some species less commonly collect live insects. When they discover a dead insect, workers surround it and extract its bodily fluids to be carried back to the nest. The remaining chitin-based shell is left behind. Occasionally, the ants bring the chitinous head of the insect back to the nest, where they also extract its inner tissue. The ants can forage individually or in small or large groups, though they often opt to do so individually. Different colonies in close proximity may have overlapping foraging regions, although they typically do not assist each other in foraging. Their main food sources normally include proteins and carbohydrates.\nInstances of carpenter ants bleeding Chinese elm trees for the sap have been observed in the northern Arizona region. These instances may be rare as the colonies vastly exceeded the standard size of carpenter ant colonies elsewhere.\nWhen workers find food sources, they communicate this information to the rest of the nest. They use biochemical pheromones to mark the shortest path that can be taken from the nest to the source. When a sizable number of workers follows this trail, the strength of the cue increases and a foraging trail is established. This ends when the food source is depleted. The workers will then feed the queen and the larvae by consuming the food they have found, and regurgitating the food at the nest. Foraging trails can either be under or above ground.\n\nAlthough carpenter ants do not tend to be extremely aggressive, they have developed mechanisms to maximize their provision from a food source when that same food source is visited by a competing organism. This is accomplished in different ways. Sometimes they colonize an area near a relatively static food supply. More often, they develop a systemic way to visit the food source with alternating trips by different individual ants or groups. This allows them to decrease the gains of intruders because the intruders tend to visit in a scattered, random, and unorganized manner. The ants, however, visit the sources systematically such that they lower the mean standing crop. They tend to visit more resource-dense food areas in an attempt to minimize resource availability for others. That is, the more systematic the foraging behavior of the ants, the more random that of its competitors.\n\nContrary to popular belief, carpenter ants do not actually eat wood because they are unable to digest cellulose. They only create tunnels and nests within it.\n\nAll ants in this genus, and some related genera, possess an obligate bacterial endosymbiont called \"Blochmannia\". This bacterium has a small genome, and retains genes to biosynthesize essential amino acids and other nutrients. This suggests the bacterium plays a role in ant nutrition. Many \"Camponotus\" species are also infected with \"Wolbachia\", another endosymbiont that is widespread across insect groups.\n\nCarpenter ants work to build the nests that house eggs in environments with usually high humidity due to their sensitivity to environmental humidity. These nests are called primary nests. Satellite nests are constructed once the primary nest is established and has begun to mature. Residents of satellite nests include older larvae, pupae, and some winged individuals. Only eggs, the newly hatched larvae, workers, and the queen reside in the primary nests. As satellite nests do not have environmentally sensitive eggs, the ants can construct them in rather diverse locations that can actually be relatively dry. Some species, like \"Camponotus vagus\", builds the nest in a dry place, usually in wood.\n\nWhen conditions are warm and humid, winged males and females participate in a nuptial flight. They emerge from their satellite nests and females mate with a number of males while in flight. The males die after mating. These newly fertilized queens discard their wings and search for new areas to establish primary nests. The queens build new nests and deposit around 20 eggs, nurturing them as they grow until worker ants emerge. The worker ants eventually assist her in caring for the brood as she lays more eggs. After a few years, reproductive winged ants are born, allowing for the making of new colonies. Again, satellite nests will be established and the process will repeat itself.\n\nRelatedness is the probability that a gene in one individual is an identical copy, by descent, of a gene in another individual. It is essentially a measure of how closely related two individuals are with respect to a gene. It is quantified by the coefficient of relatedness, which is a number between zero and one. The larger the value, the more two individuals are \"related\". Carpenter ants are social hymenopteran insects. This means the relatedness between offspring and parents is disproportionate. Females are more closely related to their sisters than they are to their offspring. Between full sisters, the coefficient of relatedness is \"r\" > 0.75 (due to their haplodiploid genetic system). Between parent and offspring, the coefficient of relatedness is \"r\" = 0.5, because, given the event in meiosis, a certain gene has a 50% chance of being passed on to the offspring. The level of relatedness is an important dictator of individual interactions.\n\nAccording to Hamilton's rule for relatedness, for relative-specific interactions to occur, such as kin altruism, a high level of relatedness is necessary between two individuals. Carpenter ants, like many social insect species, have mechanisms by which individuals determine whether others are nestmates or not. They are useful because they explain the presence or absence of altruistic behavior between individuals. They also act as evolutionary strategies to help prevent incest and promote kin selection. Social carpenter ants recognize their kin in many ways. These methods of recognition are largely chemical in nature, and include environmental odors, pheromones, \"transferable labels\", and labels from the queen that are distributed to and among nest members. Because they have a chemical basis for emission and recognition, odors are useful because many ants can detect such changes in their environment through their antennae. This allows acceptance of nestmates and rejection of non-nestmates.\n\nThe process of recognition for carpenter ants requires two events. First, a cue must be present on a \"donor animal\". These cues are called \"labels\". Next, the receiving animal must be able to recognize and process the cue. In order for an individual carpenter ant to be recognized as a nestmate, it must, as an adult, go through specific interactions with older members of the nest. This process is also necessary in order for the ant to recognize and distinguish other individuals. If these interactions do not occur in the beginning of adult life, the ant will be unable to be distinguished as a nestmate and unable to distinguish nestmates.\n\nRecognition allows for the presence of kin-specific interactions, such as kin altruism. Altruistic individuals increase other individuals' fitness at the expense of their own fitness. Carpenter ants perform altruistic actions toward their nestmates so that their shared genes are propagated more readily or more often. In many social insect species like these ants, many worker animals are sterile and do not have the ability to reproduce. As a result, they forgo reproduction to donate energy and help the fertile individuals reproduce.\n\nAs in most other social insect species, individual interaction is heavily influenced by the queen. The queen can influence individuals with odors called pheromones, which can have different effects. Some pheromones have been known to calm workers, while others have been known to excite them. Pheromonal cues from ovipositing queens have a stronger effect on worker ants than those of virgin queens.\n\nIn many social insect species, social behavior can increase the disease resistance of animals. This phenomenon, called social immunity, exists in carpenter ants. It is mediated through the feeding of other individuals by regurgitation. The regurgitate can have antimicrobial activity, which would be spread amongst members of the colony. Some proteases with antimicrobial activity have been found to exist in regurgitated material. Communal sharing of immune response capability is likely to play a large role in colonial maintenance during highly pathogenic periods.\n\nPolygyny often is associated with many social insect species, and usually is characterized by limited mating flights, small queen size, and other characteristics. However, carpenter ants have \"extensive\" mating flights and relatively large queens, distinguishing them from polygynous species. Carpenter ants are described as oligogynous because they have a number of fertile queens which are intolerant of each other and must therefore spread to different areas of the nest. Some aggressive interactions have been known to take place between queens, but not necessarily through workers. Queens become aggressive mainly to other queens if they trespass on a marked territory. Queens in a given colony can work together in brood care and the workers tend to experience higher rates of survival in colonies with multiple queens. Some researchers still subscribe to the notion that carpenter ant colonies are only monogynous.\n\nIn at least nine Southeast Asian species of the \"Cylindricus\" complex, including \"Camponotus saundersi\", workers feature greatly enlarged mandibular glands that run the entire length of the ant's body. They can release their contents suicidally by performing autothysis, thereby rupturing the ant's body and spraying toxic substance from the head, which gives these species the common name \"exploding ants.\" The enlarged mandibular gland, which is many times the size of that of a normal ant, produces a glue. The glue bursts out and entangles and immobilizes all nearby victims.\n\nThe termite species \"Globitermes sulphureus\" has a similar defensive system.\n\n\nCarpenter ants can damage wood used in the construction of buildings. They can leave behind a sawdust-like material called frass that provides clues to their nesting location. Carpenter ant galleries are smooth and very different from termite-damaged areas, which have mud packed into the hollowed-out areas. Carpenter ants can be identified by the general presence of one upward protruding node, looking like a spike, at the \"waist\" attachment between the thorax and abdomen (petiole). Control involves application of insecticides in various forms including dusts and liquids. The dusts are injected directly into galleries and voids where the carpenter ants are living. The liquids are applied in areas where foraging ants are likely to pick the material up and spread the poison to the colony upon returning.\n\nCarpenter ants and their larvae are eaten in various parts of the world. In Australia, the Honeypot ant (\"Camponotus inflatus\") is regularly eaten raw by Indigenous Australians. It is a particular favourite source of sugar for Australian Aborigines living in arid regions, partially digging up their nests instead of digging them up entirely, in order to preserve this food source. In North America, lumbermen during the early years in Maine would eat carpenter ants to prevent scurvy, and in John Muir's publication, \"First Summer in the Sierra\", Muir notes that the Digger Indians of California ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black carpenter ants. In Africa, carpenter ants are among the vast amount of species that are consumed by the San people.\n\n"}

Wanting to make a more personal record, Hebden recorded and produced the album in his North London flat over ten months using a desktop computer and a home hi-fi system. Its ten tracks feature elements of hip hop, jazz and folk; apart from a guitar part recorded for \"Slow Jam\", the music is composed from between 200 and 300 samples, many processed beyond recognition.\n\n\"Rounds\" produced two singles and one EP. Critics praised its unique fusion of electronic and organic styles, and Metacritic lists it as the fourth best-reviewed album of 2003. Several publications included \"Rounds\" on \"best albums of the decade\" lists. In May 2013, on the tenth anniversary of its release, Domino reissued \"Rounds\" with a bonus disc including a 2004 live performance.\n\nAfter being a member of Fridge since 1995, Kieran Hebden began releasing solo records under the name Four Tet in 1998. His first release was the \"Thirtysixtwentyfive\" single, followed by the albums \"Dialogue\" in 1999 and \"Pause\" in 2001. The albums were influenced by hip hop, jazz and electronic music. Hebden felt his output had sounded too much like his influences and wanted to make a record that was more personal and harder to define. He drew on influences including Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Jim O'Rourke, Timbaland, the Neptunes and Rodney Jerkins.\n\nHebden recorded \"Rounds \"over ten months in his North London flat, using a desktop computer and a home hi-fi system. With the exception of a guitar part recorded for \"Slow Jam\", he composed the music exclusively from a file of samples he had assembled over several years. The album uses between 200 and 300 samples; each song is built from between 20 and 30 samples heavily processed with the software packages AudioMulch and Cool Edit Pro, in many cases beyond recognition. The nine-minute track \"Unspoken\" was originally based on a sample from the Tori Amos song \"Winter\" but was reworked when Hebden failed to get sample clearance. Hebden also used a Creative Labs microphone to record the guitar part for \"Slow Jam\" and some sounds from television and sequenced the results in Cakewalk Pro Audio 9.\n\nAfter spending the early part of his career naming his songs with random words, Hebden decided to use more meaningful titles. \"As Serious as Your Life\" takes its name from a 1977 Val Wilmer book about free jazz in New York City. Hebden was given a copy of the book by his father and said \"I did hope that some kid would get interested and ask what the title was and then check out the book, so it's a bit like leaving little trails for people.\" He was inspired to title the album \"Rounds\" after hearing that his sister had been singing a musical round, telling an interviewer: \"It seemed totally relevant; a round is all about repetition and phasing, which is the essence of what I've been doing since I've been making music.\"\n\n\"Rounds\" contains ten instrumental tracks with a total running time of 45 minutes, which Colin Joyce of \"Spin\" called a \"folktronica tapestry.\" \"Clash\" noted that Four Tet helped pioneer the folktronica genre with \"Pause\" and \"Rounds\". \"Sound on Sound\" writer Sam Inglis said that the album was a \"blend of fragile acoustic fragments, brutal beats and glitchy electronica\"; \"The Age\" described it as \"electronic music that sounds deceptively organic.\" \"Guardian\" critic David Peschek, who noted the influence of hip hop, R&B and folk music, wrote that \"\"Rounds\" invents its own dizzying, unlikely genres.\" \"Pitchfork\"s Piotr Orlov characterised \"Rounds\" as an IDM album with production indebted to hip hop music in both its \"collage approach\" and emphasis on \"steady grooves\". \n\nJohn Bush of AllMusic found the album contained elements of electronic and experimental music combined with \"a dreamy melodicism sure to endear it to indie pop fans.\" \"Dusted\" critic Michael Crumsho noticed the influence of folk and jazz, writing that Hebden had \"taken his earlier nods to other specific genres and turned them into something wholly his own.\" \"PopMatters\" Adrien Begrand noted how \"Hebden shifts the focus from hip-hop beats, jazz influences, and far-reaching sonic adventurousness, to a more spare, focused sound\" that contributed to \"Rounds\" original sound. Nick Southall, in his review for \"Stylus Magazine\", stated that \"it is more of the same, but 'the same' for Four Tet is perpetual evolution and motion.\"\n\n\"Unspoken\" was named by several critics as the album's centrepiece Begrand described it as \"virtuosic laptop music\". \"NME\" critic Tony Naylor thought that \"As Serious as Your Life\" was one of the album's more straightforward songs. The closing track, \"Slow Jam\", was described by Begrand as a \"warm, wide-eyed, watching-the-sun-rise song\" that features chiming guitars and a sample of a child's squeaky toy.\n\nThe track \"She Moves She\" was released as a 12-inch single on 31 March 2003, with \"Cradle\" on the B-side. \"Rounds\" was released on double vinyl and compact disc by Domino on 5 May 2003, spending one week on the UK Albums Chart at number 60. The second single, \"As Serious as Your Life\", was released in October 2003 on 7- and 12-inch formats featuring remixes and a 23-minute live version; a second 12-inch of the same song, containing a remix by Jay Dee featuring rapping by Guilty Simpson, was released on 18 November 2003. An EP, \"My Angel Rocks Back and Forth\", was released in May 2004, containing \"Rounds\" tracks, two remixes, and the unreleased songs \"I've Got Viking in Me\" and \"All the Chimers\", plus a DVD of music videos for \"My Angel Rocks Back and Forth\", \"She Moves She\", \"As Serious as Your Life\" and \"Pause\" single \"No More Mosquitoes\".\n\nDomino reissued \"Rounds\" in May 2013 on double vinyl, CD, and download. The CD and vinyl releases include a bonus CD of live material recorded in 2004 previously only available on the limited edition 2004 live album \"Live in Copenhagen 30th March 2004\".\n\n\"Rounds\" received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream critics, the album received a metascore of 89 based on 26 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\nAllMusic reviewer John Bush wrote that \"though \"Rounds\" is experimental by nature\" it \"offers something for nearly every audience that could approach it.\" Michael Crumsho of \"Dusted\" found the album \"a musical salvo from an artist who’s confidently coming into his own\", describing it as \"a cozy, evocative soundtrack that’s as intricate as it is beautiful.\" In his review for \"The Guardian\", David Peschek described the album as \"a trove of bewitching melody and subtle invention\", and wrote that \"\"Rounds\" succeeds not only as a meticulously conceived piece of art but also as a moving expression of human warmth.\" In \"NME\", Tony Naylor wrote that the album was \"extraordinary\", \"essential\" and \"full of remarkable sonic ideas.\" Andy Beta, writing for \"Pitchfork\", praised the record's \"internal order\" which \"allows it to stand out against previous laptop explorations of immense record collections\".\n\nAdrien Begrand's review in \"PopMatters\" found that \"Rounds\" is \"a remarkable record\" and that \"sublime, computer-crafted recordings like \"Rounds\" provides in spades are making the most exciting sounds right now in 2003.\" In \"Spin\", Will Hermes described the album as a \"varied trip\" and noted \"a darker vibe suggesting the influence of Hebden's labelmate Dan Snaith of Manitoba.\" \"Stylus Magazine\" writer Nick Southall recognised Hebden's \"perpetual evolution and motion,\" declaring that \"this is simply a great record of beautiful music.\" Robert Christgau's review of \"Rounds\" for \"The Village Voice\" argued that Hebden \"imagines an aural space in which electronic malfunction is cute rather than annoying or ominous,\" using \"the computer as music box.\" Tom Ridge of \"The Wire\" stated that \"nothing here sounds like an exercise in genre plundering,\" and that \"Hebden has devised a musical identity that is distinctly different from his work with Fridge, but both projects share a passion for defying boundaries.\"\n\n\"Rounds\" was ranked number four on the Metacritic list of highest-scoring albums of 2003, and was named as one of the best albums of 2003 by many publications, including the \"NME\", \"The Wire\", \"The Observer\", \"Prefix\", \"Pitchfork\", \"Drowned in Sound\", \"Collective\", \"The Face\", \"Q\" and \"Uncut\".\n\nSeveral publications rated \"Rounds\" as one of the best albums of the decade, with \"Pitchfork\" placing it at number 123 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.

In the 2011 census the parish had 480 dwellings, 454 households and a population of 1,059.\n\nIn 1201 the village name was spelled \"Hasebere\". The name is derived from the Old English \"hæsel\" and \"bearu\", meaning a hazel grove or wood, plus the manorial name of the Bryene or de Bryan family; Sir Guy de Bryan, of Woodsford Castle, gave his surname to the village in the 14th century when he married the daughter of the First Earl of Salisbury.\n\nThe original settlement in the village is the hamlet of Droop, which is the location of the parish church. The church dates mostly from the 15th century, though it is perhaps the third building to have existed on the site. The other hamlets in the village are believed to have originated as a result of the Black Death twice afflicting the original settlement, and the villagers responding by burning it and rebuilding several smaller settlements on higher ground nearby.\n\nThe geology of the parish consists of Oxford clay in the northwest, a band of Corallian limestone and sand running from southwest to northeast, and Kimmeridge clay in the southeast.

{"id": "1978516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978516", "title": "Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution", "text": "Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution\n\nThe dechristianization of France during the French Revolution is a conventional description of the results of a number of separate policies conducted by various governments of France between the start of the French Revolution in 1789 and the Concordat of 1801, forming the basis of the later and less radical \"laïcité\" policies. The aim of the campaign between 1790 and 1794 ranged from the appropriation by the government of the great landed estates and the large amounts of money held by the Gallican Church (the Roman Catholic Church in France) to the termination of Christian religious practice and of the religion itself. There has been much scholarly debate over whether the movement was popularly motivated.\n\nThe French Revolution initially began with attacks on Church corruption and the wealth of the higher clergy, an action with which even many Christians could identify, since the Gallican Church held a dominant role in pre-revolutionary France. During a two-year period known as the Reign of Terror, the episodes of anti-clericalism grew more violent than any in modern European history. The new revolutionary authorities suppressed the Church, abolished the Catholic monarchy, nationalized Church property, exiled 30,000 priests, and killed hundreds more. In October 1793, the Christian calendar was replaced with one reckoned from the date of the Revolution, and Festivals of Liberty, Reason, and the Supreme Being were scheduled. New forms of moral religion emerged, including the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being and the atheistic Cult of Reason, with the revolutionary government briefly mandating observance of the former in April 1794.\n\nIn 18th-century France, the vast majority of the population adhered to the Catholic Church as Catholicism had been since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 the only religion officially allowed in the kingdom. Nonetheless, minorities of French Protestants (mostly Huguenots & German Lutherans in Alsace) and Jews still lived in France at the beginning of the Revolution. The Edict of Versailles, commonly known as the Edict of Tolerance, had been signed by Louis XVI on 7 November 1787 and had not given non-Catholics in France the right to openly practice their religions but only the rights to legal and civil status, which included the right to contract marriages without having to convert to the Catholic faith. At the same time, libertine thinkers popularized atheism and anti-clericalism.\n\nThe Ancien Régime institutionalised the authority of the clergy in its status as the First Estate of the realm. As the largest landowner in the country, the Catholic Church controlled properties which provided massive revenues from its tenants; the Church also had an enormous income from the collection of tithes. Since the Church kept the registry of births, deaths, and marriages and was the only institution that provided hospitals and education in some parts of the country, it influenced all citizens.\n\nA milestone event of the Revolution was the abolition of the privileges of the First and Second Estate on the night of 4 August 1789. In particular, it abolished the tithes gathered by the Catholic clergy.\n\nThe Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen of 1789 proclaimed freedom of religion across France in these terms:\n\nOn October 10, 1789, the National Constituent Assembly seized the properties and land held by the Catholic Church and decided to sell them as assignats.\n\nOn July 12, 1790, the assembly passed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy that subordinated the Catholic Church in France to the French government. It was never accepted by the Pope and other high-ranking clergy in Rome.\n\nThe programme of dechristianization waged against Catholicism, and eventually against all forms of Christianity, included:\n\n\nAn especially notable event that took place in the course of France’s dechristianization was the Festival of Reason, which was held in Notre Dame Cathedral on 10 November 1793.\n\nThe dechristianization campaign can be seen as the logical extension of the materialist philosophies of some leaders of the Enlightenment such as Voltaire, while for others with more prosaic concerns it provided an opportunity to unleash resentments against the Catholic Church (in the spirit of conventional anti-clericalism) and its clergy.\n\nIn August 1789, the State cancelled the taxing power of the Church. The issue of Church property became central to the policies of the new revolutionary government. Declaring that all Church property in France belonged to the nation, confiscations were ordered and Church properties were sold at public auction. In July 1790, the National Constituent Assembly published the Civil Constitution of the Clergy that stripped clerics of their special rights — the clergy were to be made employees of the state, elected by their parish or bishopric, and the number of bishoprics was to be reduced — and required all priests and bishops to swear an oath of fidelity to the new order or face dismissal, deportation or death.\n\nFrench priests had to receive Papal approval to sign such an oath, and Pius VI spent almost eight months deliberating on the issue. On 13 April 1791, the Pope denounced the Constitution, resulting in a split in the French Catholic Church. Over fifty percent became abjuring priests (\"jurors\"), also known as \"constitutional clergy\", and nonjuring priests as \"refractory clergy\".\n\nIn September 1792, the Legislative Assembly legalized divorce, contrary to Catholic doctrine. At the same time, the State took control of the birth, death, and marriage registers away from the Church. An ever-increasing view that the Church was a counter-revolutionary force exacerbated the social and economic grievances and violence erupted in towns and cities across France.\n\nIn Paris, over a forty-eight-hour period beginning on 2 September 1792, as the Legislative Assembly (successor to the National Constituent Assembly) dissolved into chaos, three Church bishops and more than two hundred priests were massacred by angry mobs; this constituted part of what would become known as the September Massacres. Priests were among those drowned in mass executions (\"noyades\") for treason under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Carrier; priests and nuns were among the mass executions at Lyons, for separatism, on the orders of Joseph Fouché and Collot d'Herbois. Hundreds more priests were imprisoned and made to suffer in abominable conditions in the port of Rochefort.\n\nAnti-Church laws were passed by the Legislative Assembly and its successor, the National Convention, as well as by département councils throughout the country. Many of the acts of dechristianization in 1793 were motivated by the seizure of Church gold and silver to finance the war effort. In November 1793, the \"département\" council of Indre-et-Loire abolished the word \"dimanche\" (). The Gregorian calendar, an instrument decreed by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, was replaced by the French Republican Calendar which abolished the sabbath, saints' days and any references to the Church. The seven-day week became ten days instead. It soon became clear, however, that nine consecutive days of work were too much, and that international relations could not be carried out without reverting to the Gregorian system, which was still in use everywhere outside of France. Consequently, the Gregorian Calendar was reimplemented in 1795.\n\nAnti-clerical parades were held, and the Archbishop of Paris, Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel, was forced to resign his duties and made to replace his mitre with the red \"Cap of Liberty.\" Street and place names with any sort of religious connotation were changed, such as the town of St. Tropez, which became Héraclée. Religious holidays were banned and replaced with holidays to celebrate the harvest and other non-religious symbols. Many churches were converted into \"temples of reason,\" in which Deistic services were held. Local people often resisted this dechristianisation and forced members of the clergy who had resigned to conduct Mass again. Maximilien Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety denounced the dechristianizers as foreign enemies of the Revolution, and established their own new religion. This Cult of the Supreme Being, without the alleged \"superstitions\" of Catholicism, supplanted both Catholicism and the rival Cult of Reason. Both new religions were short-lived. Just six weeks before his arrest, on 8 June 1794, the still-powerful Robespierre personally led a vast procession through Paris to the Tuileries garden in a ceremony to inaugurate the new faith. His execution occurred shortly afterward, on 28 July 1794.\n\nBy early 1795 a return to some form of religion-based faith was beginning to take shape and a law passed on 21 February 1795 legalized public worship, albeit with strict limitations. The ringing of church bells, religious processions and displays of the Christian cross were still forbidden.\n\nAs late as 1799, priests were still being imprisoned or deported to penal colonies. Persecution only worsened after the French army led by General Louis Alexandre Berthier captured Rome in early 1798, declared a new Roman Republic, and also imprisoned Pope Pius VI, who would die in captivity in Valence, France in August 1799. However, after Napoleon seized control of the government in late 1799, France entered into year-long negotiations with new Pope Pius VII, resulting in the Concordat of 1801. This formally ended the dechristianization period and established the rules for a relationship between the Catholic Church and the French State.\n\nVictims of the Reign of Terror totaled somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000. According to one estimate, among those condemned by the revolutionary tribunals about 8 percent were aristocrats, 6 percent clergy, 14 percent middle class, and 70 percent were workers or peasants accused of hoarding, evading the draft, desertion, rebellion, and other purported crimes. Of these social groupings, the clergy of the Catholic Church suffered proportionately the greatest loss.\n\nAnti-Church laws were passed by the Legislative Assembly and its successor, the National Convention, as well as by département councils throughout the country. The Concordat of 1801 endured for more than a century until it was abrogated by the government of the Third Republic, which established a policy of laïcité on 11 December 1905.\n\nUnder threat of death, imprisonment, military conscription, and loss of income, about twenty thousand constitutional priests were forced to abdicate and hand over their letters of ordination, and six thousand to nine thousand of them agreed or were coerced to marry. Many abandoned their pastoral duties altogether. Nonetheless, some of those who had abdicated continued covertly to minister to the people.\n\nBy the end of the decade, approximately thirty thousand priests had been forced to leave France, and several hundred who did not leave were executed. Most French parishes were left without the services of a priest and deprived of the sacraments. Any non-juring priest faced the guillotine or deportation to French Guiana. By Easter 1794, few of France's forty thousand churches remained open; many had been closed, sold, destroyed, or converted to other uses.\n\nVictims of revolutionary violence, whether religious or not, were popularly treated as Christian martyrs, and the places where they were killed became pilgrimage destinations. Catechising in the home, folk religion, syncretic and heterodox practices all became more common. The long-term effects on religious practice in France were significant. Many who were dissuaded from their traditional religious practices never resumed them.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that there are no constitutional barriers in place to prevent a judge from accepting a guilty plea from a defendant who wants to plead guilty while still protesting his innocence under duress as a detainee status. This type of plea has become known as an Alford plea, differing slightly from the \"nolo contendere\" plea in which the defendant agrees to being sentenced for the crime, but does not admit guilt. Alford died in prison in 1975.\n\nHenry Alford was a black man in the South at the height of the civil rights movement. He had visited a prostitute at a bar and allegedly got into a fight with Nathaniel Young. Young was later killed from a shotgun blast. Henry Alford was indicted for first-degree murder in North Carolina in December 1963. His attorney, having graduated just a few years previously, interviewed several witnesses and was convinced of Alford's guilt. Despite Alford’s claims of innocence and no eyewitness to the crime, witnesses saw him retrieve his gun, shortly before the murder, state he was going to kill the victim, and then upon returning home, stated that he had carried out the act. Alford also had a lengthy criminal history, including a prior conviction for murder. The attorney believed that Alford would probably be convicted in a trial, and thus recommended Alford plead guilty to the lesser charge of second-degree murder in order to avoid the death penalty. Ultimately, however, the decision was up to Alford. Before the plea was entered, the court heard sworn testimony from three witnesses. There were no eyewitnesses to the murder, but witnesses swore that Alford had taken his gun from his house and declared he was going to kill the victim, and upon returning, stated that he had killed the victim. Alford pleaded guilty to second-degree murder but declared to the court that he was in fact innocent, and was pleading guilty only to avoid the death penalty, which might have been applied had he been convicted of first-degree murder.\n\nThe judge sentenced Alford to the maximum second-degree murder penalty of 30 years in prison. Alford appealed on the constitutional ground that his plea was \"the product of fear and coercion\", in violation of his constitutional rights. A federal appeals court ruled that the plea was involuntary because it was motivated by fear of the death sentence, and the court should have rejected the guilty plea. The federal appeals court vacated the sentence of the lower court.\n\nJustice Byron White wrote that the Court had accepted the case for review because some states authorized conviction only for a crime “where guilt is shown,” including by means of a guilty plea that included an actual admission of guilt; but “others have concluded that they should not ‘force any defense on a defendant in a criminal case,’ particularly when advancement of the defense might ‘end in disaster...’” and therefore would accept a guilty plea in Alford's circumstances.\n\nWhite wrote that courts may accept whatever plea a defendant chooses to enter, as long as the defendant is competently represented by counsel; the plea is intelligently chosen; and “the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt.” Faced with “grim alternatives,” the defendant's best choice of action may be to plead guilty to the crime, White wrote, and the courts must accept the defendant's choice made in his own interests.\n\nIn the dissent, Justice William Brennan stated that capital punishment in the United States was unconstitutional, and wrote that the actual effect of this unconstitutional threat to Alford was to induce a guilty plea. He concluded the plea should have been vacated and Alford should have been retried, writing: \"the facts set out in the majority opinion demonstrate that Alford was 'so gripped by fear of the death penalty' that his decision to plead guilty was not voluntary but was \"the product of duress as much so as choice reflecting physical constraint.\"\n\nStephanos Bibas (who would be appointed as a federal judge by President Donald Trump in 2017) has spoken out against the \"Alford\" plea on the moral ground that it undermines public confidence in the accuracy and fairness of the criminal justice system, sending some people to jail who profess innocence; and that it dodges the \"morality play\" aspect of a criminal trial, in which the community sees that the guilty are punished.\n\n\n\n"}

The status is usually granted by a judge without a hearing, and it entitles the person to a waiver of normal costs, and sometimes in criminal cases the appointment of counsel. While court-imposed costs such as filing fees are waived, the litigant is still responsible for other costs incurred in bringing the action such as deposition and witness fees. However, in federal court, a pauper can obtain free service of process through the United States Marshal's Service.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of writ of certiorari petitions to the Supreme Court are filed \"in forma pauperis\". Most of those petitioners are prisoners.

Successful in both singles and doubles, he had an unusually long professional career, with many of his accomplishments coming toward the end of his career, and he is popular among spectators and other players alike for his winning demeanor and shot-making abilities; he is also one of a rare breed of player who plays two-handed on both the forehand and backhand sides.\n\nOwing to his longevity on the tour and consistent ranking, Santoro holds several ATP records: the most career wins over top ten opponents for a player who never reached the top ten (40), and the third-most appearances in singles competition at Grand Slam events behind Roger Federer and Feliciano López (70). He also has the second-most losses in singles play behind López (444, though he won even more matches).\n\nIn singles play, Santoro earned six titles, but reached the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam only once. His career-high ranking of world No. 17 belied his impressive record against top ten opposition.\n\nHe had greater success in doubles competition, with two Grand Slam doubles titles, one mixed doubles title, and 25 doubles championships overall to his name.\n\nSince March 2019, Santoro is the coach of Canadian tennis player Milos Raonic.\n\nAfter having lost in the early rounds of the 1988 Jr French Open and 1988 Jr US Open, Santoro won the 1989 Jr French Open. He also had a semifinal appearance in the 1989 Jr US Open.\n\nWhen Santoro successfully defended his 2007 title by winning the 2008 Newport tournament at the age of 35, he became the oldest tennis player to win back-to-back championships at an ATP singles event.\n\nIn addition, Santoro won what was, at the time, the longest singles match in the open era: at the 2004 French Open, he beat fellow Frenchman Arnaud Clément in a 6-hour 33 minute first-round match (6–4, 6–3, 6–7(5), 3–6, 16–14). The record stood until John Isner defeated Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon in 2010, but still remains the French Open record.\n\nAs a singles tennis player, the 2006 Australian Open was Santoro's only Grand Slam quarterfinal appearance.\n\nIn singles play, Santoro defeated 18 players who were ranked world no. 1 at some time during their careers: Novak Djokovic, Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, Jim Courier, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Thomas Muster, Marcelo Ríos, Gustavo Kuerten, Carlos Moyá, Pat Rafter, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Marat Safin, Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Roddick, and Roger Federer (against whom he has a 2–9 record). Against other former world no. 1 players, Santoro is 0–6 against Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 0–1 against Ivan Lendl, 0–1 against Rafael Nadal, and 0-2 against Andy Murray. Santoro is famous for his winning record against Marat Safin (7–2); Safin himself has said, \"Being told I would play Santoro was being told I was to die.\"\n\nSantoro won the 2003 and 2004 Australian Opens doubles titles, partnering Michaël Llodra, a French compatriot, and was runner-up at the 2002 Australian Open, 2004 French Open and 2006 Wimbledon Championships. He also won the 2005 French Open mixed doubles title with Daniela Hantuchová. Santoro teamed with Michaël Llodra again to win the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, a competition that included the top eight doubles teams in the world.\n\nIn addition to his doubles prowess, Fabrice is noted for his cheery attitude on court and his vast arsenal of trick shots, making him a crowd favorite and gaining him the admiration of his peers. In recognition of Santoro's varied and innovative style of play, Pete Sampras has nicknamed him \"The Magician\".\n\nSantoro plays with two hands on forehand and backhand, and though he is right-handed, often slices his forehand with his left hand. He attributes this to having used racquets of the same weight throughout his career, which were too heavy for a six-year-old starting off a career to hold with one hand. Santoro was fast around the court and was a skilled defensive player.\n\nWith his participation in the 2008 Australian Open, he broke Andre Agassi's record in Grand Slam appearances over his career with a total of 62. Santoro retired at the end of the 2009 season at his hometown tournament at the 2009 BNP Paribas Masters in Paris (Bercy), losing his final singles match against James Blake and final doubles match against Johan Brunström and Jean-Julien Rojer while partnering compatriot Sébastien Grosjean.\n\nSantoro came out of retirement for one tournament at the 2010 Australian Open in order to obtain the record for having played in Grand Slam tournaments in four different decades, logging a total of 70 appearances in Grand Slam tournaments. At 37, he was the oldest player in the ATP top 100, being ranked 68 when he entered this last tournament. He lost in the first round of the tournament – to Marin Čilić – ending his professional tennis career.\n\nHe was the first leader of the ATP Champions Race, winning the first tournament of the year in Doha in the year the race was introduced (2000).\n\nAccording to the ATP website after the 2019 Davis Cup Finals, Feliciano López has lost more singles matches (449) than any other professional player (active or not), surpassing the record previously held by Santoro. Overall, however, Santoro has won more than half of his matches, with a career record of 470–444.\n\nSantoro is a big fan of the late French comedian Michel Colucci, better known as Coluche.\n\nSantoro has a daughter named Djenae.\n\nSince 2012, Santoro has featured as part of the television commentary and analysis team for British television channel ITV, at the French Open.\n\n"}

Mozart's Requiem is written primarily in D minor, as are the famous Queen of the Night Aria, \"Der Hölle Rache\", the ouverture and the final scene of Don Giovanni. Of the two piano concertos that Mozart wrote in a minor key, one of them is in D minor: Piano Concerto No. 20, K. 466. Furthermore, his string quartet no. 13 K173 and string quartet no. 15 K421 (one of the high profile Haydn-quartets) are also in D minor.\n\nThe only chamber music compositions in D minor by Ludwig van Beethoven are his stormy Piano Sonata No. 17 and the haunting Largo of the Ghost Trio Op. 70/1. Franz Schubert's \"Death and the Maiden Quartet\" is in D minor. A number of Gabriel Fauré's chamber music works are written in the D minor, including the Piano Trio Op. 120, the First Piano Quintet Op. 89, and the First Cello Sonata Op. 109. Arnold Schoenberg's \"Verklärte Nacht\" is in D minor, as is his String Quartet No. 1.\n\nSince D minor is the key of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, Anton Bruckner felt apprehensive about writing his own Symphony No. 9 in the same key. As well as Bruckner's First Mass, some other post-Beethoven symphonies are in D minor, including Symphony No. 4 by Robert Schumann, the only Symphony written by César Franck, and Symphony No. 3 by Gustav Mahler.\n\nJean Sibelius often reserved the key of D minor for compositions he saw as being of a noble character; the Violin Concerto, the Sixth Symphony, and the string quartet \"Voces intimae\" are each in the key.\n\nThe tonality of D minor held special significance for Helene and Alban Berg.\n\nWorks in the classical music era and later beginning in minor typically end in major, or at least on a major chord (such as a picardy third), but there are a few notable examples of works in D minor ending in much sharper keys. Two symphonies that begin in D minor and end in E major are Havergal Brian's \"Gothic Symphony\" and Carl Nielsen's Symphony No. 4 (\"The Inextinguishable\"). Franz Liszt's \"Dante Symphony\" opens in D minor and ends in B major.\n\nSimilar to a D minor symphony ending in D major, as with Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, a D major symphony can have for its allegro first movement a slow introduction in D minor. Robbins Landon wrote that \"Tonic minor Adagio introductions, especially in the key of D minor, were very popular with English composers of the year 1794\", and Joseph Haydn copied this procedure for the D major symphonies he wrote in London.\n\nFilm composer Hans Zimmer is one of the most prominent users of the key of D minor in modern times. Many of his well-known scores were written in the key; notable examples are \"Gladiator\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" and \"The Da Vinci Code\". His frequent use of the key has been noticed by reviewers such as Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks, who has called the trend \"ridiculous stubbornness\".\n"}

Sullivan\n\nWilliam Cornelius Sullivan (1912–1977) directed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) domestic\nintelligence operations from 1961-1971. He headed the Justice Department's new Office of National Narcotics Intelligence from June 1972 to July 1973.\n\nWilliam Cornelius Sullivan was born on May 12, 1912, in Bolton, Massachusetts. He graduated from Hudson High School and held advanced degrees from American University and George Washington University. Sullivan received an honorary doctorate from Boston College.\n\nSullivan joined the FBI early in World War II, when he was dispatched by J. Edgar Hoover on an undercover intelligence mission to Spain. Sullivan returned to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and took the first in a series of administrative posts that culminated in a decade as head of the domestic intelligence division, starting in 1961, and a brief tenure as the FBI's third-ranking official behind Hoover, the director, and his longtime confidant, Clyde Tolson. \n\nSullivan claimed Hoover's concerns about the American Communist Party were overemphasized when compared to violations of Federal civil rights laws in the segregated South. This friction worsened as Sullivan made his opinions public. Many FBI insiders considered Sullivan the logical successor to Hoover. However, on October 1, 1971, Hoover abruptly had the locks changed on Sullivan's door and removed his nameplate. Under the circumstances, Sullivan was forced to retire.\n\nSullivan then became even more vocal about Hoover's controversial domestic counterintelligence programs, collectively labeled COINTELPRO, including operations that he himself had conceived and administered. These were intended to spread confusion and dissension among political groups in the United States ranging from the Communist Party (CPUSA), Civil Rights Movement, and Anti-Vietnam War Movement on the left to the Ku Klux Klan on the far right.\n\nSullivan described the frameup of party leader William Albertson in a June 30, 1964, internal document filed by him and fellow FBI agent Fred J. Baumgardner: In 1975, he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, \"Never once did I hear anybody, including myself raise the question, is this course of action which we have agreed upon lawful, is it legal, is it ethical or moral?\"\n\nSullivan was instrumental in arranging for the mailing of a tape recording in 1964 to Coretta Scott King which contained secretly taped recordings of her husband Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking with other women. In a memorandum, Sullivan called King \"a fraud, demagogue and scoundrel\". He also gave orders to track down fugitive members of the Weather Underground in the early 1970s.\n\nAccording to his autobiography, \"The Bureau: Thirty Years in Hoover's FBI\", Sullivan felt that Samuel Pierce, later to serve in the Ronald Reagan administration, would be a better representative for the civil rights movement than King. He wrote the following recommendation in a letter to Hoover: Hoover had learned from the SOLO brothers, Morris and Jack Childs, who were members of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), but in fact were double agents working against the Soviet Active Measures program of the KGB, that one of King's consultants, Stanley Levison, was involved with the CPUSA. Annually, the Solo brothers would travel to Moscow to pick up Soviet funding for CPUSA activities and distribute it on their return. Because such contacts suggested the civil rights movement was being co-opted by the CPUSA under the guidance of the KGB's Soviet Active Measures program, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ordered the tapping of King's telephone. The telephonic surveillance led to information concerning King's affairs, and the reason why Sullivan thought King unworthy of leading the movement and being \"a fraud, demagogue and scoundrel.\" Realizing the danger to the movement, King's friend and mentor, Rev. Ralph Abernathy pleaded, on numerous occasions, that King cease and desist such behavior, as he was putting at risk the credibility of the movement. Eventually, King's behavior led J. Edgar Hoover to publicly call King a \"notorious liar.\"\n\nA number of days after Hoover called King \"the most notorious liar in the country\" at a press conference, Sullivan wrote an anonymous letter to King calling him a \"filthy, abnormal animal\" and telling him that there \"is only one thing left for you to do\".\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson, not questioning the reason for Hoover's statement but realizing the political impact for the next election, forced Hoover to apologize. Hoover and King did meet at FBI Headquarters, but no one knows what happened. Some sources claim that Hoover had all of King's files and telephone transcripts on his desk. Ultimately, it was Sullivan who was responsible for gathering all the information on King.\n\nAfter Hoover's death in May 1972, U.S. Attorney General Richard Kleindienst appointed Sullivan director of the newly created Office of National Narcotics Intelligence under the Department of Justice in June 1972. Sullivan had hoped to replace Hoover as the director of the FBI, but was passed over by President Richard Nixon in favor of loyalist L. Patrick Gray.\n\nSullivan married Marion Hawkes.\n\nSullivan died age 65 from an accidental gunshot wound, as recounted by Robert D. Novak: Sullivan is buried in his family's plot at St. Michael Cemetery in Hudson, Massachusetts, with his wife, as well as his parents, sister and other relatives.\n\nSullivan is portrayed by the actor Tom Sizemore in the 2017 film \"\".\n\n\n"}

The island is about wide with steep slopes on all sides. It was named by James Cook, first European to sight the island in 1778, for Lt. James King, a member of his party. It is part of the Bering Sea unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe island was once the winter home of a group of about 200 Inupiat who called themselves Aseuluk, meaning \"people of the sea,\" or Ukivokmiut, from Ukivok, the village of King Island and \"miut,\" meaning \"people of\" or \"group of people\".\n\nThe Ukivokmiut spent their summers engaging in subsistence hunting and gathering on King Island and on the mainland near the location of present-day Nome, Alaska.

Subsistence activities on and around the island included hunting seals and walruses, crab fishing, and gathering bird eggs and other foods. The spring and summer was the important time of gathering to the Ukivokmiut, while the winters were the time of dance. Due to the limited daylight during the winter, the days were spent dancing in the \"Qagri\", or men's communal house. As an example, the month of December is known to the Ukivokmuit as \"Sauyatugvik\" or the time of drumming.\n\nAfter the establishment of Nome, the islanders began to sell intricate carvings to residents of Nome during the summer.\n\nIn the mid-1900s the Bureau of Indian Affairs closed the school on Ukivok, forcefully taking the children of Ukivok to go to school on mainland Alaska, leaving the elders and adults to gather the needed food for winter. Because the children were not on the island to help gather food, the adults and elders had no choice but to move to mainland Alaska to make their living. By 1970, all King Island people had moved to mainland Alaska year-round.\n\nAlthough the King Islanders have moved off the island, they have kept a very distinct cultural identity, living a very similar life as they had on the island. Some King Islanders still return to the island to gather subsistence foods, such as walrus and seal.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006 the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded a research project which brought a few King \nIsland natives back to the island. Some participants had not been back to the island in 50 years. The King Island Community awaits the project's results.\n\nKing Island first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated native Inuit village of \"Ookivagamute.\" In 1890, it returned as Ukivok. It next appeared in 1910 as King Island and would continue to report until 1960, with the exception of 1950 when no figure was reported. It next reported as Ukivok again, classified as a native village (ANVSA) in 1980 and 1990, but with no residents. It has not reported since.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1978601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978601", "title": "Barnegat Lighthouse", "text": "Barnegat Lighthouse\n\nBarnegat Lighthouse or Barnegat Light, colloquially known as \"Old Barney\", is a historic lighthouse located in Barnegat Lighthouse State Park on the northern tip of Long Beach Island, in the borough of Barnegat Light, Ocean County, New Jersey, United States, on the south side of Barnegat Inlet.\n\nThe development of the original lighthouse began in June 1834 with the appropriation of $6,000 from Congress. The lighthouse was commissioned the next year, though mariners at the time considered the building's non-flashing, fifth-class light to be inadequate. Because of the strong currents in the inlet, the lighthouse was built away from the water; but within ten years only separated the tower from the water.\n\nIn 1855, Lt. George G. Meade, an Army engineer and later a Union General in the American Civil War, was assigned to design a new lighthouse. He was chosen largely because of his recent design of Absecon Light. Meade completed the construction plans in 1855 and work began in late 1856. Because of continuing erosion during its construction, the new lighthouse was located about south of the original structure, the site of which is now submerged. During construction, in June 1857, the light in the original structure was relocated to a temporary wooden tower located nearby. This was prompted by the encroaching seas which threatened the original lighthouse and ultimately caused the tower to collapse into the water later that year. Because of the rough waters of the area, several jetties have been built throughout the history of both lighthouses.\n\nBarnegat Light was commissioned on January 1, 1859. The tower light was above sea level and the lighthouse itself was tall, four times taller than the original. The new light was a first-order flashing Fresnel lens, which stood about tall. The total cost of the project was about $40,000, with the lens alone costing $15,000. The current lighthouse is really two towers in one: the exterior conical tower covers a cylindrical tower on the inside.\n\nThe lighthouse's beacon remained a first-class navigational light until August 1927 when the Barnegat Lightship was anchored off the coast. This prompted the automation and replacement of the first-order lens with a gas blinker. As a result, the tower's light was reduced by over 80 percent. The gas blinker was replaced several weeks later with a 250-watt electric bulb, though the gas apparatus can still be seen at the top of the tower.\n\nThe light was deactivated as a Coast Guard lookout tower in January 1944 and given to the State of New Jersey. Four years later, the local municipality, Barnegat City, renamed itself Barnegat Light. In 1954, the lens was returned to the borough of Barnegat Light and is now on exhibit in the Barnegat Light Museum. The area around the lighthouse was declared a state park and dedicated in 1957. The lightship was removed in 1969.\n\nThe structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Barnegat Lighthouse in 1971.\n\nIn 1988, the tower was closed for construction of the new south jetty, then reopened to visitors in 1991 with a new walkway on top of the jetty. The top of the lighthouse is accessible via its 217 steps and continues to attract in excess of half a million visitors year round.\n\nIn 2008, the Friends of Barnegat Lighthouse State Park, a local non-profit organization, raised funds to reactivate the lighthouse. A sum of $35,000 was raised, with $15,000 contributed by the Barnegat Light Borough Fraternal Order of Police Local Lodge No. 5. This supported the acquisition of a new $15,000 VRB-25 light system, as well as the replacement of ageing windows. Funding was raised entirely at the local level.\n\nIn October 2008, the VRB-25 system was installed. While physically smaller than the original light, the system has become a standard for US Lighthouses, with more than 100 installed.\n\nOn January 1, 2009, at 5:00 pm, the 150th anniversary of its opening, Barnegat Lighthouse activated its beacon for the first time since before World War II .\n\nThe light now operates daily from dusk until dawn. There is a foghorn on Barnegat South Breakwater Light 7, at the ocean end of the south breakwater, which guards the inlet. The tower is flood-lit at night.\n\nAdjacent to the lighthouse is the Barnegat Lighthouse Interpretive Center, run by the state of New Jersey and staffed by Members of the non-profit group that purchased the new light. The center shows the history of Barnegat Lighthouse from shipwreck to first-class seacoast light. Exhibits focus on the history of the lighthouse, lighthouse technology, the duties of Barnegat Lighthouse's keepers, and efforts to protect Barnegat Lighthouse.\n\nSeveral blocks away is the Barnegat Light Museum, operated by the Barnegat Light Historical Society. It houses the light's original first-order Fresnel lens, as well as related exhibits including images of Sinbad, the WWII Coast Guard dog who was enlisted in the service, retired to Barnegat, and is buried at the base of the old Coast Guard station flagpole.\n\nBarnegat Lighthouse is the subject of \"Keeper of the Tower\", a suspense fiction novel by Barnegat resident Brett Scott Ermilio. The novel takes place circa 1919.\n\nThe lighthouse is depicted on New Jersey's \"Shore Conservation\" license plates and on the 1996–1997 Federal Duck Stamp.\n\n\n\n"}

It has panoramic views of the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco Bay, the Palace of Fine Arts, Alcatraz, and the Presidio.\n\nThe Pacific Heights Residents Association defines the neighborhood as stretching from Union Street to Bush Street in the north–south direction and from Van Ness Avenue to Presidio Avenue in the east-west direction. As of 2017, Google Maps delineates its north–south extension more narrowly as reaching from Green Street to California Street.\n\nIn 2013, Pacific Heights was named the most expensive neighborhood in the United States. The article stated that if San Francisco's Pacific Heights had its own zip code, it would be the most expensive place to live in the United States. The 94115 zip code includes both Pacific Heights' \"Gold Coast\", an area famous for its billionaire residents and record-breaking prices, and \"The Western Addition\", an area about 20 blocks away where real estate prices are significantly lower. In 2017, \"Curbed SF\" again announced the \"occasionally chic, hardly affordable, always elite Pacific Heights\" as San Francisco's most expensive neighborhood. A $40 million Pacific Heights mansion was listed as San Francisco's most expensive home. Later in the year, Business Insider gave a preview inside San Francisco's most exclusive neighborhood, where old money rubs elbows with tech billionaires. In 2018, Pacific Heights continued to garner accolades and was voted as one of the 15 most prestigious residential neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. Pacific Heights has also been listed among the top 10 richest neighborhoods in San Francisco.\n\nPacific Heights is situated on a primarily east–west oriented ridge that rises sharply from the Marina District and Cow Hollow neighborhoods to the north to a maximum height of above sea level. Pacific Heights features two parks, Lafayette and Alta Plaza. Visible to the north are the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin Headlands, and Alcatraz Island. Visible to the south are Twin Peaks and the Sutro Tower.\n\nLower Pacific Heights refers to the area located south of California Street down to Post Street. While this area was previously considered part of the Western Addition, the new neighborhood designation became popularized by real estate agents in the early 1990s.\n\nThe neighborhood was first developed in the 1870s, with small Victorian-inspired homes built. Starting around the beginning of the 20th century, and especially after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many were replaced with period homes. Still residential, the area is characterized by painted Victorian style architecture.\n\nThe oldest building in Pacific Heights, located at 2475 Pacific Avenue, was built in 1853, though the majority of the neighborhood was built after the 1906 earthquake. The architecture of the neighborhood is varied; Victorian, Mission Revival, Edwardian, and Château styles are common.\n\nSeveral countries have consulates in Pacific Heights. They include Italy, Greece, Vietnam, South Korea, China, and Germany.\n\nMost of the neighborhood's boutiques and restaurants can be found along Fillmore Street, south of Pacific Avenue. They include stores like Athleta, Prada, Marc by Marc Jacobs, and Ralph Lauren. Other businesses in Pacific Heights are located on California and Divisadero Streets, as well as on Van Ness Avenue.\n\nPacific Heights is home to several schools, including the San Francisco University High School; Drew School (formerly Drew College Preparatory School); the Hamlin School; Convent of the Sacred Heart High School; Stuart Hall High School, San Francisco Waldorf School, Academy of Thought and Industry, and Town School for Boys, among others. The celebrated Grant Elementary School was open on Pacific Ave from 1922 to 1972. Its students included children of diplomats, the well to do, and the adjacent Presidio military base. Current elementary schools include Hillwood Academic Day School, which opened in 1949.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department Northern Station serves Pacific Heights.\n\n\n\n"}

It was pre-recorded on 30 July - 8 August 2003 shortly after the fourth series of \"Big Brother\" ended and was aired on Channel 4 over five nights on 13–17 October 2003. The program consisted of five episodes, each approximately 60 minutes long including adverts, with Elaine Hackett serving as executive producer for Endemol UK Productions. Channel 4 announced the series on 22 May 2003 for the broadcaster's educational division 4Learning with the aim of transmitting the series in late 2003 or early 2004. The series was controversial as some felt the broadcaster was exploiting the teenagers while the program featured the first sexual act between two contestants in the history of the British adaptation of \"Big Brother\". \n\nThe series followed a similar format to its parent show where the contestants, known as Housemates, lived inside a specialty built compound known as the \"Big Brother\" House at Elstree Studios. The Housemates were constantly filmed during their time in the House and were not permitted to speak with those filming them. Due to the pre-recorded nature of the programme the viewing public was unable to vote during evictions and decide the winner instead the Housemates did all the voting during their time in the House. The Housemates competed to win a trip around the world worth £30,000 which was won by Paul Brennan after he was crowned the winner with a majority vote from his Housemates. Brennan chose to share his prize with Caroline Cloke, the runner-up. \n\nChannel 4 announced it had commissioned \"Teen Big Brother: The Experiment\" from Endemol UK Productions shortly prior to the launch of the fourth series of \"Big Brother\". The programme was part of an effort to produce educational programming that was aimed at a young adult market. The programme was revealed by Heather Rabbatts from Channel 4's educational division, 4Learning, at the World Education Market in Lisbon. The audition process used to select the Housemates was similar to the one Endemol used in the past for \"Big Brother\". Elaine Hackett served as the executive producer for the series while Marcus Bentley returned to narrate the series. In a change Dermot O'Leary, host of \"Big Brother's Little Brother\" presented the series instead of Davina McCall.\n\nThe main television coverage for \"Teen Big Brother\" was screened during five episodes, each approximately 60 minutes long including adverts, on Channel 4 from 13 October to 17 October 2003 at 10pm. E4 previewed each episode a day before they were transmitted on Channel 4. Due to the pre-recorded nature of the programme there was no live streaming or any spin-off shows that aired during the original broadcast. The show was later re-aired as part of Channel 4's 4Learning programme block in January 2004.\n\nThe format was changed slightly from previous series of \"Big Brother\". Housemates were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact to and from the outside world. During their time in the House, the housemates took part in a compulsory task that determined the amount of money they were allocated to spend on their shopping; if they passed, they received a luxury budget and they were allocated a basic budget if they failed. Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow Housemates for eviction. This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. The two or more housemates who gathered the most nominations were then nominated for eviction and the remaining Housemates that were safe from eviction had to decide which nominee would be evicted. On the final day the remaining Housemates voted for who they wanted to win \"Teen Big Brother\". Housemates could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules could have been ejected by Big Brother. The teen Housemates were not allowed to have cigarettes or alcohol during their stay in the House.\n\nAll the Housemates in this edition were eighteen years old when they entered the \"Big Brother\" House. \n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nThe series attracted criticism for Channel 4 after the press began to report about two of the Housemates having sex inside the House. The Learning and Skills Council gave Channel 4 advice as part of its work enhance education contents of their programmes which included \"Teen Big Brother\". In an interview with The Guardian in September 2003, Channel 4 confirmed that incident would not air as part of its 4Learning educational arm but references to the incident would not be cut out. At the time Channel 4 had not confirmed any other plans for the programme. After the broadcaster decided to show \"Teen Big Brother\" in primetime it began receiving criticism from the media. The episode which featured the incident was watched by 1.9 million viewers on Channel 4 and was the lowest rated out of all five. A Channel 4 spokeswoman said \"the broadcaster was happy with the show's ratings.\"\n\n"}

It was founded in 1919, shortly after the creation of Czechoslovakia. It is named after Jan Amos Comenius, a 17th-century Czech teacher and philosopher.\n\nIn 2006, Comenius University had more than 30,000 students and 2,000 faculty members. As are most universities in Slovakia, it is funded mostly by the government. Although there have been plans to establish tuition fees for university students in Slovakia for years, another attempt failed to gain sufficient support in parliament in May 2005.\n\nThe Comenius University was established in 1919 with assistance from the more established University of Prague. It was meant to replace the former Elisabeth University which was located in Bratislava since 1912 as the latter has been forcefully disbanded in 1919 by Samuel Zoch, plenipotentiary župan of Slovakia, after Hungarian professors refused to take an oath of allegiance at that time in the First Czechoslovak Republic. This has caused the majority of the university's professors (and some of the students) to take refuge in Budapest, where the Elisabeth University was reestablished. It has been later moved to Pécs and renamed to University of Pécs. This persecution of former (predominantly Hungarian) pillars of education in Bratislava necessitated the recruitment of Czech academicians. Therefore, many professors of the newly established university, including its first rector, Prof. MUDr. Kristian Hynek, were Czechs, since Slovakia at that time did not have enough educated Slovak speakers who could serve as faculty members. In spite of personnel, financial, and space difficulties, the university developed research and teaching programs. The Faculty of Medicine opened in 1919, and was quickly followed by the Faculties of Law and Philosophy in 1921. The Faculty of Philosophy, besides offering programs in the humanities and social science, also educated much-needed teachers for Slovakia's high schools.\n\nIn 1937, a new university building for the Faculties of Law and Philosophy was opened in the centre of Bratislava. The building includes the Aula (hall) used for graduation ceremonies and other formal functions.\n\nDuring World War II, Slovakia became nominally a republic, but was actually under the sway of Nazi Germany. The government reduced academic freedoms at the university, and the Czech professors were forced out. The university was renamed \"Slovak University\" in 1939, though the original name was reinstated in 1954. The Faculty of Science opened in 1940 and the Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was established in 1941. Academic freedom returned after the end of the war in 1945 but was again cancelled in 1948 as the communists took power in Czechoslovakia, enforcing the ideology of Marxism-Leninism at Czechoslovak universities. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology was taken under direct control of the Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, the university continued to grow, and new faculties were established (mostly by splitting the existing faculties):\n\nAfter the Velvet Revolution in 1989, the university created a democratic self-government, and mandatory courses on Marxist ideology were abolished. The Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology and the Evangelical Theological Faculty joined the university.\n\nThe transformation of Slovakia into a market economy created a need for professionals in management and financial sciences. As a result, the\nuniversity established the Faculty of Management 1991 and the Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences in 2002. In 2000, the European credit transfer system was implemented to improve student mobility and facilitate more ties with other European universities.\n\nThis is a list of faculties of Comenius University in Bratislava with their official English names.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They ran for two years and implicated over seventy people. These included Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, on charges of high treason.\n\nThe \"witches\" allegedly held their covens on the Auld Kirk Green, part of the modern-day North Berwick Harbour area. The confessions were extracted by torture in the Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh. The main source for this story was published in a 1591 pamphlet \"Newes from Scotland\" and was subsequently published in King James's dissertation on contemporary necromancy titled \"Daemonologie\" in 1597.\n\nThis was the first major witchcraft persecution in Scotland, and began with a sensational case involving the royal houses of Denmark and Scotland. King James VI sailed to Copenhagen to marry Princess Anne, sister of Christian IV of Denmark. During their return to Scotland they experienced terrible storms and had to shelter in Norway for several weeks before continuing. The admiral of the Danish fleet, Peder Munk argued with the treasurer Christoffer Valkendorff about the state of the ships, and blamed the storm on the wife of a high official in Copenhagen whom he had insulted. Witchcraft trials were held in Denmark in July 1590. One of the first Danish victims was Anna Koldings, who, under pressure, divulged the names of five other women; one of whom was Malin, the wife of the burgomaster of Copenhagen. They all confessed that they had been guilty of sorcery in raising storms that menaced Queen Anne's voyage, and that they had sent devils to climb up the keel of her ship. In September two women were burnt as witches at Kronborg. James heard news from Denmark regarding this and decided to set up his own tribunal.\n\nThe main witches directly involved in the trials were:\n\n\nVery soon more than a hundred suspected witches in North Berwick were arrested, and many confessed under torture to having met with the Devil in the church at night, and devoted themselves to doing evil, including poisoning the King and other members of his household, and attempting to sink the King's ship.\n\nThe two most significant accused persons were Agnes Sampson, a respected and elderly woman from Humbie, and Dr John Fian, a schoolmaster and scholar in Prestonpans. Both refused to confess, but were put to severe torture. Sampson was brought before King James and a council of nobles. She denied all the charges, but after being tortured horrifically, she finally confessed. By special commandment, her head and body hair was shaven; she was fastened to the wall of her cell by a witch's bridle, an iron instrument with 4 sharp prongs forced into the mouth, so that two prongs pressed against the tongue, and the two others against the cheeks. She was kept without sleep and thrown with a rope around her head, and only after these ordeals did she confess to the fifty-three indictments against her. She was finally strangled and burned as a witch. According to \"Newes from Scotland, Declaring the Damnable Life of Dr. Fian, a Notable Sorcerer\", a pamphlet published in 1591, Sampson confessed to attending a Sabbat with 200 witches, Duncan among them.\n\nDr. Fian also suffered severe torture. He endured having his fingernails forcibly extracted, then having iron pins thrust therein, the pilliwinks, and the boot. He was finally taken to the Castlehill in Edinburgh and burned at the stake on 16 December.\n\nAccording to Christopher Smout, between 3,000 and 4,000 accused witches may have been killed in Scotland in the years 1560–1707.\n\nScottish witches were linked to storms when a maid named Gillis Duncan (or Geillis Duncan), who worked for a man named David Seaton in the town of Tranent, was forced into a confession by her employer. Apparently Duncan suddenly began to exhibit a miraculous healing ability and would sneak out of the house during the night. When Seaton confronted Duncan and she could not explain her new ability and strange behaviour, he had her tortured. Under torture, she confessed to being a witch and accused many others of witchcraft. According to the contemporary pamphlet \"Newes from Scotland\", 1591, she named numerous individuals, both women and men:\n\nDuncan was also found to have conspired with Euphame MacCalzean in the murder of Duncan's godfather.\n\nGillis Duncan caused the apprehension of Barbara Naper for bewitching to death Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus. Archibald was reported to have died from a disease so strange there could be no cure or remedy. He fell ill and at Langhope and died at Smeaton near Dalkeith on 4 August 1588.\n\nBarbara Napier had come from a good family and had married a book dealer named George Ker in 1572. George died at La Rochelle in 1576 and she then married Archibald Douglas whose brother was the laird of Corshogill. Napier had bought charms to help her own health and to try and fix her poor relationship with Jean Lyon, Countess of Angus who employed her and her husband. They did not work as she lost her job. When it all came to trial Napier was accused of a practice to kill the king by witchcraft but was found guilty of only the lesser crime of conspiring with witches. James VI ordered the Chancellor to have physicians examine her to see if she was pregnant, and if she was not, to have her burnt and publicly disembowelled. James wanted an appeal to overturn the first verdict and although her fate is unclear, it is possible that she was eventually burnt to death. The opinion of the 17th-century historian of the Douglas family, David Hume of Godscroft, was that she had been released.\n\nShakespeare adapted many concepts from the trials, including the rituals confessed by the witches and the Scottish setting, in his tragedy \"Macbeth\". Heavily influenced by the incidents made public, the play was published a few years after King James's \"Daemonologie\". Borrowing many quotes from the treaties, the three witches cast their spells in the same manner: \"purposely to be cassin into the sea to raise winds for destruction of ships.\"\n\nThe trials and the events leading up to them are fictionalised in the 1971 young adult historical novel \"The Thirteenth Member\" by Mollie Hunter.\n\nHeavy/doom metal group Cathedral has a song called \"North Berwick Witch Trials\" on their 2005 album \"The Garden of Unearthly Delights\".\n\nDiana Gabaldon's \"Outlander\" series of novels features a recurring character named Geillis Duncan who is tried and convicted of being a witch. In the television adaptation she is portrayed by Lotte Verbeek.\n\n"}

From the mid-1970s through the 1980s, he worked with Kenny Rogers. Many of his albums with Rogers went either gold or platinum and accumulated many millions of sales around the world. These albums include \"Kenny Rogers\" (1976), \"The Gambler\" (1978), \"Gideon\" (1980) and \"I Prefer The Moonlight\" (1987). Rogers and Butler maintained a friendship outside of show business. Butler also produced Rogers' 1993 album \"If Only My Heart Had A Voice\". He also participated in Rogers 2006 retrospective DVD \"The Journey\".\n\nButler is the only Nashville producer to win the Grammy Award for Producer of the year.\n\nBorn in Pensacola, Florida, Butler began his career at the age of six with the Harry James Orchestra; at age ten he sang with Red Foley, and before he was old enough to drive he had hosted his own radio show and played piano on The Lynn Toney Show, a live television show in his market. He eventually joined a Florida band, \"Jerry Woodward and the Esquires\". While on a trip to Nashville, he met a noted publisher/producer, Buddy Killen of Tree International. In 1963, with Killen's encouragement, Butler moved to Nashville with only a few dollars in his pocket. Soon his unique style of piano playing supported such hits as \"Hello Darlin\" by Conway Twitty and \"Honey\" by Bobby Goldsboro. Butler was in high demand as a Nashville session player and backed up Nashville celebrities such as Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Bobby Goldsboro, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charlie Rich, Lynn Anderson and more.\n\nMoving to Memphis in the late 1960s, Butler hooked-up with Chips Moman. Butler played keyboards in the rock group Ronny and the Daytonas, who had a hit song with \"GTO\". Later, as a member of The Gentrys, they hit the pop charts with \"Keep on Dancing\" and \"Every Day I Have to Cry Some\". During that same period, Butler co-wrote \"the Poppies\" hit single \"Lullaby Of Love\". He was signed as a solo artist and served as Bobby Goldsboro's pianist and music director.\n\nButler returned to Nashville to join Capitol Records as an in-house producer. The first single he produced, \"Seven Lonely Days\", became a Billboard Top-20 Country single for Jean Shepard in 1969. Moving on to CBS Records at the urging of legendary producer Billy Sherrill, Butler worked closely with Johnny Cash producing some of \"the man in black\"'s biggest hits in the 1970s. So successful was the partnership that Butler became Cash's producer, pianist, musical director and studio manager. He even was given a solo track (a piano instrumental) on the album \"The Johnny Cash Family Christmas\" in 1972.\n\nIn 1973 Butler made one of his most significant career moves by joining United Artists Records as head of the label's Nashville division. His leadership and vision brought in such acts as Kenny Rogers, Crystal Gayle, Dottie West and The Kendalls and established the label as one of the most successful and respected in Nashville.\n\nButler teamed again with Chips Moman and penned the number 1 hit \"(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song\". Topping the charts for both Pop and Country, the song became one of B. J. Thomas' greatest career hits. It was a BMI 3 million performance song and earned Butler a Grammy for Song of the Year.\n\nEventually Butler left UA and started his own independent company, Larry Butler Productions.

Butler also worked with Kenny and Kim Carnes on their smash hit \"Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer\".\n\n1980 brought Butler to the spotlight again with his Grammy for Producer of the Year and solidified his reputation as a hit maker. Tammy Wynette cut Butler's \"Only The Strong Will Survive\" while Billie Joe Spears cut \" Standing Tall\" which was also released by Lorrie Morgan in 1996. Butler writing credits include songs for Tree, United Artists music, April Blackwood, Great Cumberland, EMI and, most recently, his own Larry Butler Music.\n\n1984 was the year Butler formed his music publishing companies, Larry Butler Music Group, Inc. He signed writers Mickey Newbury, Dean Dillon, Bud McGuire, Paul Nelson, Marty Raybon, Julie Didier, Larry Jon Wilson, and Bob Melton. CBS Songs administered his catalog. Butler's new group quickly produced a string of hits for George Strait including \"The Chair\", \"Ocean Front Property\" and \"It Ain't Cool\". Also \"Shine, Shine, Shine\" for Eddy Raven, \"Miami My Amy\" for Keith Whitley, \"The Factory\" for Kenny Rogers, \"I Just Called To Say Goodbye Again\" for Larry Boone and \"One Man Band\" for Moe Bandy. LBMG produced additional songs for Vern Gosdin, Alabama, Shenandoah, Razzy Bailey, T. G. Sheppard, Tracy Lawrence and more. And, Butler wrote \"Wonder What You'll Do When I'm Gone\" for Waylon Jennings, putting the company on the map. During a period of two years LBMG produced five Number Ones, eight Top Tens and numerous Top Forty chart records and album cuts.\n\nButler died in his sleep in Pensacola, Florida on January 20, 2012.

{"id": "1978673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978673", "title": "Nothing Is Sound", "text": "Nothing Is Sound\n\nNothing Is Sound is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Switchfoot. It was released on September 13, 2005, and debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200. The first single from this album was \"Stars,\" which was the number one most-added song on Modern Rock Radio, and received much airplay on alternative rock stations upon release. A second single \"We Are One Tonight\" was released in early 2006, but without much success on the \"Billboard\" charts.\n\nThe album was marred by major controversy over the inclusion of XCP copy protection distributed on all copies of the disc. This led to bassist Tim Foreman posting a detailed work-around on the band's website (which was promptly removed by Columbia Records). \"Nothing Is Sound\" was at the forefront of the Sony BMG CD copy prevention scandal, which eventually led to the recall of all CDs that contained the protection.\n\nAfter the large success of Switchfoot's previous record, \"The Beautiful Letdown\", the band found itself constantly touring and were forced to work on most of the new record while on the road. As a result, many of the songs on \"Nothing Is Sound\" made their public debuts at various shows on the tours. Every night on tour, the band would write parts to new songs, and test them out during the shows.\"There's nothing like playing a new song in front of real people with real opinions. The people at those shows, (the extended Switchfoot family), they shaped this song as much as anyone,\" lead singer Jon Foreman said.\n\n\"Nothing Is Sound\" is characterized as being a much \"darker\" album compared to Switchfoot's other releases. Jon Foreman even hinted that the album could be viewed as \"a dark chapter revealing even more mysteries to be solved\". Lyrically the songs explore topics ranging from loneliness, the end of the world, anti-entropy, and the commercialization of sex. The band has always viewed the album as being more hopeful than anything, pointing to songs like \"The Shadow Proves the Sunshine\" as how a seemingly dark theme can actually be positive. Foreman says, \"I may write about how everything is meaningless, but it’s a very hopeful thing for me to be proven wrong.\". The song is a fan favourite and is often played live at their shows.\n\nMusically, the record features the most densely layered guitar work by the band to date. This is attributed to the official addition to the band of touring guitarist Drew Shirley, whose work on the song \"Golden\" provided a \"mellow, ethereal roof over top of the song,\" as Foreman noted. \"Noise never sounded more beautiful!\"\n\nIn October, just over a month after its original release date, \"Nothing Is Sound\" was certified gold by the RIAA for selling 500,000 copies. The incredible pacing tapered off significantly, following the revelation of Sony's rootkit on the disks. The November 1, 2006 edition of \"Billboard\" magazine reported that \"Nothing Is Sound\" had sold 549,000 units. It debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number three, being the highest that any Switchfoot album has ever placed. \"Stars\" is the best charting single of the album, reaching as high as 16 on the modern rock chart, and number 68 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn November 2005, it was revealed that Sony was distributing albums with Extended Copy Protection, a controversial feature that automatically installed rootkit software on any Microsoft Windows machine upon insertion of the disc. In addition to preventing the CDs contents from being copied, it was also revealed that the software reported the users' listening habits back to Sony and also exposed the computer to malicious attacks that exploited insecure features of the rootkit software. Though Sony refused to release a list of the affected CDs, the Electronic Frontier Foundation identified \"Nothing Is Sound\" as one of the discs with the invasive software.\n\nBassist Tim Foreman posted a way around the protection on the bands message boards. The original post was soon deleted, which caused some people to speculate that Sony would sue the band over this issue. However, no legal action has been taken. Jon Foreman would later say that he felt the album was \"tainted\" by this.\n\nAn additional copy protection problem was found on some of the disks that were published by EMI. These disks contained Cactus Data Shield copy protection. Some copies of that version were also recalled due to incorrect copy protection settings, although they were exchanged for other copy-protected copies with the correct settings.\n\nA DualDisc version of \"Nothing is Sound\" was released simultaneously with standard editions of the album. Notable is the fact that these DualDisc CDs did not contain the copy protection software.\n\nThe DVD-side of the album featured the entire album in 5.1 Surround sound, and also includes an approximately 30-minute-long documentary on the making of the album.\n\nSwitchfoot's first music video from this album is \"Stars\", which was filmed almost entirely underwater. Switchfoot has since released a live video version of \"Stars\", and another two videos for the album's second single \"We Are One Tonight\". The band also filmed a video for the song \"Happy Is a Yuppie Word\" in anticipation of its being released as the first single. However, it was never formally released, but was later included on the DVD \"Switchfootage 2\" along with a video for The Blues.\n\nIn addition to the mainstay tracks listed above, the album was released with extra material at different stores.\n\n\n\nRecorded at Signature Sound, Big Fish, House of Cards Studio, Big Brown Sound, Starstruck Studio, The Pass, Stellenbosch Univ. S. Africa, and dingy backstage dressing rooms.\n\nMixed at MixThis! and Resonate Music, Burbank, CA . Mastered at Sterling Sound, New York City.\n\nIn 2006, the album was nominated for a Dove Award for Rock/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 37th GMA Dove Awards. The song \"Stars\" was also nominated for two Dove Awards.\n\n"}
{"id": "1978685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978685", "title": "Buffalo Bayou", "text": "Buffalo Bayou\n\nBuffalo Bayou is a slow-moving river which flows through Houston in Harris County, Texas. Formed 18,000 years ago, it has its source in the prairie surrounding Katy, Fort Bend County, and flows approximately east through the Houston Ship Channel into Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to drainage water impounded and released by the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, the bayou is fed by natural springs, surface runoff, and several significant tributary bayous, including White Oak Bayou, Greens Bayou, and Brays Bayou. Additionally, Buffalo Bayou is considered a tidal river downstream of a point west of the Shepherd Drive bridge in west-central Houston.\n\nAs the principal river of Greater Houston, the Buffalo Bayou watershed is heavily urbanized. Its direct drainage area contains a population of over 440,000. Including tributaries, the bayou has a watershed area of approximately .\n\nThe upper watershed of Buffalo Bayou is impounded by the Addicks and Barker reservoirs, which comprise a major flood control system for the region. The reservoir system plays a crucial role in delaying and attenuating the peak outflow of the river during large rainfall events. Moving eastward, the Buffalo flows under State Highway 6 and into Terry Hershey Park, a linear park which follows the bayou for approximately , culminating at Beltway 8.\n\nThe bayou meanders around the Memorial Villages between Beltway 8 and Loop 610. The banks along this reach are mostly private property, however there is a public access point and official Texas Parks and Wildlife paddling trail canoe launch at Briarbend Park, which is located in a quiet neighborhood south of San Felipe and west of Voss Road. There is another official canoe launch and access point just outside of 610 on Woodway. Additionally, it is legal to access the bayou at all public roadway bridges, but legal parking spots may not exist near these bridges.\n\nOn the east side of Loop 610, Buffalo Bayou passes along the south side of Memorial Park and the north side of River Oaks Country Club, and is accessible to the public along the entire Memorial Park frontage. Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, the former estate of Houston philanthropist Ima Hogg, is located on the north bank of the bayou just east of Memorial Park. After passing under Shepherd Drive, the waterway enters Buffalo Bayou Park, which is bordered on the north by Memorial Drive and the south by Allen Parkway. The park continues for to Interstate 45, where it enters Downtown Houston. The bayou flows past Allen's Landing and joins White Oak Bayou before exiting the central business district at Interstate 69. The bayou widens considerably as it travels through the East End, culminating at the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nAlong with Galveston Island and Galveston Bay itself, Buffalo Bayou was one of the focal points for early Anglo-American settlement in early Texas, first part of the Spanish Empire and then part of Mexico. Early communities began to appear at the beginning of the 19th century, including Lynchburg, Harrisburg, and Rightor's Point (modern Morgan's Point) in the 1820s. The bayou became important in Texas history when the final battle for Texas Independence was fought along its banks where it merges with the San Jacinto River.\n\nIn the 1830s, new communities such as Houston were established along the shoreline. A local entrepreneur named Samuel Allen (unrelated to the founders of Houston) established a large ranch, later known as the Allen Ranch, between Harrisburg and Galveston Bay. Docks at Harrisburg, Houston, and the Allen Ranch gradually became the foundations of what would become the modern Port of Houston. Harrisburg served as the region's major trade center until the 1870s, when a large fire destroyed its railroad facilities, which were subsequently rebuilt in Houston.\n\nHouston's original docks, today known as Allen's Landing, were established at the foot of Main Street at the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou. The first wharves were opened in 1840, and the Port of Houston was established in 1841. This was the most westerly location a small trading schooner could turn around; without extensive dredging, only small vessels could access the city. This site is now a public park adjacent to the University of Houston–Downtown.\n\nAfter the Civil War, which bolstered the local economy, dredging became a more viable option. The Bayou Ship Channel Company began major dredging operations in 1870, and the city began receiving federal aid to complete the project. This first dredging of the Buffalo Bayou was completed in 1876.\nBy the mid-20th century, the Port of Houston had established itself as the leading port in Texas, eclipsing the natural harbors at Galveston and Texas City. The Turning Basin terminal in Harrisburg (now part of Houston) became the port's largest shipping point. The Texas oil boom of the early 20th century spurred further industrial development.\n\nExtreme floods in the first half of the 20th century, especially in 1929 and 1935, devastated Downtown Houston and resulted in a number of federally-funded flood control projects in the upper reaches of the watershed. The Texas Legislature created the Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) in 1937, and by the end of the 1930s, over $35 million ($ million in 2016 dollars) of federal, state, and county funds had been earmarked for an extensive drainage program. In then-rural western Harris County, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed Barker Reservoir, completed in 1945, and Addicks Reservoir, completed in 1948. Combined, these reservoirs provide 410,000 acre-feet of runoff storage, which has largely prevented downstream flood events. Six miles of Buffalo Bayou between present-day Highway 6 and Beltway 8 was channelized during the construction of the reservoirs. Later, between 1953 and 1958, the stretch between Shepherd Drive and Sabine Street west of Downtown was also straightened. The length of bayou between these two channelized sections, which largely runs through the Memorial Villages, has remained in its natural, meandering state.\n\nIn the 1960s, local resident and conservationist Terry Hershey, working with local congressman (and eventual President) George H.W. Bush, prevented the federal government from lining the straightened sections of the bayou with concrete. In 1966, Hershey and a number of other homeowners in the Memorial area formed the Buffalo Bayou Preservation Association, which later expanded its mission and became the Bayou Preservation Association. In 1989, Terry Hershey Park, which runs parallel to the bayou between Beltway 8 and Highway 6, was dedicated to her efforts. The bayou is one of the only bayous in Houston to retain its natural riparian ecosystem.\n\nFollowing the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, Houston sought to address the untreated sewage that was being discharged into the bayous. The city has invested over $3 billion into new sewers, pumping stations, and sewage treatment plants across the metropolitan area, which has significantly improved water quality in the region.\n\nIn 1977, Barbours Cut Terminal was opened at Morgan's Point, shifting shipping traffic away from the Turning Basin.\n\nIn 1986, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, a nonprofit organization, was founded to leverage public and private financing towards renovating and expanding park space along the river. The Partnership's 2002 Buffalo Bayou Master Plan established a 20-year, $5.6 billion vision for the bayou centered on a series of linear parks through central Houston. The project goals include the rehabilitation of formerly industrial land, habitat restoration, canoeing and kayaking facilities, hike-and-bike trails, cultural programming, flood control management, and mixed-use urban development.\n\nThe Partnership has leveraged over $150 million to implement these projects. The Buffalo Bayou Promenade, opened in 2006, is a recreation area with of hiking and biking trails extending from Sabine Street west of Downtown to Bagby Street in the Theater District. In 2015, the Partnership completed Buffalo Bayou Park immediately to the west of the Promenade, adding another of renovated parkland along a stretch. Buffalo Bayou Park, labeled a \"signature, verdant downtown gateway\" by the \"Houston Chronicle\", includes a dog park, broad lawns, gardens, restaurants, and an art space inside a historic disused cistern. In 2006 the Houston Cistern, managed by the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, started offering historical tours and immersive art exhibits.\n\nIn August 2017, extensive rainfall from Hurricane Harvey brought the bayou to record high levels, shattering previous flood crests by several feet. Addicks and Barker reservoirs were filled to capacity, forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to initiate controlled releases of to prevent catastrophic uncontrolled releases and protect the structural integrity of the dams. Despite these efforts, uncontrolled releases did occur around the spillway at the northern end of Addicks Reservoir for the first time in the structure's history.\n\nThe reservoir releases caused extensive flooding of neighborhoods and roadways along the western stretch of Buffalo Bayou between Barker Reservoir and Downtown; the Memorial area was heavily damaged. The bayou was projected to remain at a major flood stage for up to two weeks after the storm in order to drain the reservoirs as much as possible.\n\nThe Buffalo Bayou watershed is central to the drainage of Houston and Harris County. Lying over relatively impervious soils and very flat topography, the bayou has extensive natural floodplains, as do most Gulf coastal rivers and streams. Urbanization of the watershed has placed thousands of people in vulnerable areas and has affected the frequency and intensity of flood events.\n\nIn response to the disastrous flood of 1935, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in association with the Harris County Flood Control District, began an extensive program of reservoir construction, removal of stream-bank vegetation, and channelization to reduce Houston's flooding risk. The two most prominent flood control features in the Buffalo Bayou watershed are the Addicks and Barker reservoirs in western Harris County, which provide a combined of open land for runoff storage. In recent years, extensive suburban development upstream of the reservoirs has stressed this flood control infrastructure.\n\nSince 2015, Buffalo Bayou has experienced three major flooding events, including Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the Tax Day floods of 2016 and a flood on May 26, 2015.\n\nBuffalo Bayou is home to numerous urban parks, including George Bush Park (located entirely within Barker Reservoir), Terry Hershey Park, Memorial Park, Buffalo Bayou Park, and Marron Park in the East End. San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site, the site of the Battle of San Jacinto which ended the Texas Revolution, includes the USS Texas, a museum ship permanently moored near the mouth of the bayou.\n\nThe bayou supports a significant population of catfish, sunfish, gars, and bass for recreational fishing. It includes a population of birds and hosts the popular Waugh Bat Bridge. Alligators have also been spotted along the bayou.\n\nBuffalo Bayou is legally navigable by paddle craft from its source in Katy to the western end of the Ship Channel upstream of Wayside Drive. A majority of paddle trips generally take place between Highway 6 and Shepherd Drive section, with main focus on the section from Briarbend Park to Woodway and to Downtown Houston, generally because of ease of access and length of the trail.\n\nThe section from Highway 6 to Beltway 8 is known for downed trees, which require frequent portages. The section from Beltway 8 to Briarbend Park is generally kept clear of blockages by the Harris County Flood Control District; however, there are several gravel bar hazards to negotiate during normal water flows. The section from Briarbend Park to Woodway is similarly kept clear, although there may be trees across the waterway immediately after storms.\n\nAs an urban waterway, Buffalo Bayou is especially vulnerable to low water quality. The condition of the bayou's waters has long been a topic of concern in Houston. During the 19th century, the river essentially functioned as both an open sanitary sewer and a source of drinking water. Industrial and agricultural discharge into the water was a common practice, and the bayou took on a reputation as a \"cesspool\" with an \"unbearable stench.\" It was not until the early 20th century that the city had the resources to construct sewerage and sewage treatment plants. However, environmental progress was slow, and Buffalo Bayou was still heavily polluted through the late 1940s.\n\nToday, the bayou still faces significant environmental challenges, including elevated levels of indicator bacteria, low oxygen saturation, and heavy nutrient pollution.\n\nIn February 2019, it was reported that 64,000 gallons of jet fuel leaked into the bayou via the nearby Hobby Airport.\n\n\n\nPreservation websites\n"}

It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nThe film tells the story of an old-fashioned conservative lawyer who falls in love with a daughter from a family of fitness fanatics.\n\nConservative lawyer Adam Calhorn Shaw (Edmund Purdom) hopes to be elected to office, like his father, and his father's father. He is engaged to a sophisticated society lady, Beth Hallson (Linda Christian).\n\nArriving at a nursery to complain about the peach trees he had previously purchased, Adam meets the energetic and eccentric Athena Mulvain (Jane Powell), the oldest of seven sisters in a family of anti-smoking, vegetarian, teetotallers who follow astrology and numerology.\n\nAthena offers to give him advice on how to mulch the peach trees, however, Adam is uneasy, and leaves. Later, at a party, Athena arrives, mulches Adam's peach trees, kisses him, and announces her intention to marry him. She also decides, after a numerological calculation, that Adam's friend Johnny Nyle (Vic Damone) would be perfect for her sister, Minerva (Debbie Reynolds).\n\nAthena returns to Adam's house the next morning, to the shock of Adam's fiancée. Adam promises to tell Athena that he has no romantic interest in her, but finds she has left. He asks his legal secretary Miss Seely to search for her but to no avail. Eventually Johnny returns and tells Adam that Athena's family owns a health food store, and that he can find her there.\n\nThat night when Adam goes to the house, he meets the meditating Grandma Salome, Minerva and Athena's 5 other beautiful, singing and dancing sisters: Niobe, Aphrodite, Calliope, Medea and Ceres. He also meets the bodybuilders that the girls' grandfather Louis Calhern) has been training for the Mr. Universe competition, Ed Perkins and Bill Nichols.\n\nDespite the bizarre ways of the family, and although Adam initially tries to resist Athena, he eventually succumbs to her charms, and breaks up with Beth. Just when all is looking rosy, Grandma foresees difficult times ahead. Athena's sisters advise Athena to break up with Adam, however Athena chooses to push ahead with the relationship, knowing that \"love can change the stars\".\n\nThe sisters visit Adam's house while he is out and perform a makeover, removing rugs and screens and installing large urns and fresh flowers. Adam's influential family friend, Mr. Grenville, Adam's law firm partner, Mr. Griswalde, and Adam's campaign manager for election to the United States Congress, Mr. Tremaine, phone Adam's house and reach Athena on the phone. Curious, they visit Adam's house only to find Grandma there in place of the girls.\n\nAdam invites Athena to a formal reception at Mr. Grenville's home. Athena at first charms the party with her pleasant nature and an off-the-cuff rendition of an aria from a Donizetti opera. However she loses her temper when Beth presents Athena with a buffet dinner where all of the vegetables are stuffed with meat.\n\nMore difficulties arise when Adam humiliates Ed Perkins and Grandpa on television at the \"Mr. Universe\" final. Grandpa had hoped that Ed would marry Athena to produce perfect children. Adam verbally attacks Grandpa over the hypocrisy of many of his beliefs. Ed threatens Adam by putting him in a hold that Adam gets out of by throwing Ed in a jiu jitsu throw with both events appearing on nationwide television. Adam is told by his minders that his political career is over because he embarrassed the belief system of Athena's people, alienating voters with those sympathies, whilst those opposed to their beliefs would associate Adam with holding their beliefs by merely being with them.\n\nDespite requisite further conflict, harmony is restored and all of the main players gather around for a Mulvain-style feast.\n\nThe film features several songs by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane including\n\n\nThe film was an original story. It was originally meant to star Elizabeth Taylor then Jane Powell. Esther Williams then became attached. In 1953 Williams left for maternity leave. Before her departure, she had assumed she would appear in \"Athena\", when she returned, as she claimed had helped create the premise with writers Leo Pogostin and Charles Walters.\n\nMGM initially announced that Williams' appearance in \"Athena\" would be postponed to enable her to make another musical \"Bermuda\" for Joe Pasternak. However, the studio decided to cast Williams in \"Jupiter's Darling\" and replaced her with Jane Powell, who was taken off \"Love Me or Leave Me\". They changed the main character from a swimmer to a singer, to accommodate Powell. Janet Leigh and Vera-Ellen were also cast in the film, but dropped out.\n\nThe male lead was given to Edmund Purdom who had become a leading man in \"The Student Prince\" (1954). MGM head of production Dore Schary was keen to build up Purdom as a star. Filming was pushed back so Purdom could replace Marlon Brando in \"The Egyptian\".\n\nChiquita and Johnson from the Moulin Rouge were meant to appear in the film.\n\nDirector Dick Thorpe was less than enthusiastic about the picture. After a scene was finished, he would toss the pages of the script over his shoulder and walk away. In her autobiography, Jane Powell said that it really discouraged the cast. Powell also said that the film would have been better received had it been made twenty years later.\n\nEdmund Purdom and Linda Christian had an affair during filming and later married.\n\nAccording to MGM records the film made $1,222,000 in the US and Canada and $658,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $511,000.\n\nSteve Reeves' appearance in the film led to his casting in \"Hercules\" (1958). The 13-year-old daughter of that film's director, Pietro Francisci, saw Reeves in \"Athena\" and recommended him to her father. This was one of two films where Reeve's actual voice was heard; \"Jail Bait\" (1954) is the other. His European films were all dubbed by voice actors.\n\n"}

Its policy has been developed by ICANN and Fundació puntCAT. It was approved in September 2005.\n\nBefore .cat was available, and given the reluctance of certain Catalan institutions, companies, and people, to use .es, .ad, .fr, .it domains (depending on the state respectively) for their domains, alternatives emerged. An example of this was the website for the city of Girona in Catalonia, which preferred to use a .gi domain (\"ajuntament.gi\", the word \"ajuntament\" meaning both \"city council\" and \"town hall\"), even though .gi is the country code for Gibraltar, instead of the corresponding .es as a Spanish local authority.\n\nTo solve this matter, in September 2005 the .cat TLD was approved, designed to meet the wishes and needs of the Catalan linguistic and cultural community on the Internet. This community is made up of those who use Catalan for their online communications, and/or promote the different aspects of Catalan culture online and prefer it to any other domain. The initial registration period went from February 13, 2006, to April 21, 2006. The registry was open to everybody starting April 23, 2006.\n\nIn September 2017 a Spanish court ordered that all .cat domain names that were being used to promote the Catalan independence referendum shall be taken down. On September 20 the Spanish police raided the offices of puntCAT and arrested CTO Pep Masoliver for sedition. Following this, puntCAT released several tweets and a press statement on their website that condemned this action, calling it \"shameful and degrading, unworthy of a civilized country [and] immensely disproportionate\".\n\nOn October 31, 2017 several Catalan Government websites including \"president.cat\", \"govern.cat\" and \"catalangovernment.eu\" were taken down due to the political crisis in Catalonia and due to the take over of authority by the Government of Spain.\n\nThe .cat domain is not territorial, but applies to the whole Catalan-speaking community, whether or not a site is based in Catalonia. In order to be granted a .cat domain, one needs to belong to the Catalan linguistic and cultural community on the Internet. A person, organization or company is considered to belong if they either:\n\n\nDespite the restrictions, the domain has been exploited for feline-related domain hacks, such as nyan.cat. In September 2017, with the domain's filters weakened after the raid by Spanish police, American neo-Nazi website \"The Daily Stormer\" was briefly hosted on a .cat address.\n\nFollowing the success of the .cat domain, other language and culture-based domain names have emerged, such as .eus and .gal for the Basque language and culture (Euskadi) and the Galician language and culture (Galicia), respectively, as well as the .bzh domain-name dedicated to the Breton language and culture in Brittany.\n\n"}

Basu invented simple examples that displayed some difficulties of likelihood-based statistics and frequentist statistics; Basu's paradoxes were especially important in the development of survey sampling. In statistical theory, Basu's theorem established the independence of a complete sufficient statistic and an ancillary statistic.\n\nBasu was associated with the Indian Statistical Institute in India, and Florida State University in the United States.\n\nDebabrata Basu was born in Dacca, Bengal, unpartitioned India, now Dhaka, Bangladesh. His father, N. M. Basu, was a mathematician specialising in number theory. Young Basu studied mathematics at Dacca University. He took a course in statistics as part of the under-graduate honours programme in Mathematics but his ambition was to become a pure mathematician. After getting his master's degree from Dacca University, Basu taught there from 1947 to 1948.\n\nFollowing the partition of India in 1947, Basu made several trips to India. In 1948, he moved to Calcutta, where he worked for some time as an actuary in an insurance company. In 1950, he joined the Indian Statistical Institute as a research scholar under C.R. Rao.\n\nIn 1950, the Indian Statistical Institute was visited by Abraham Wald, who was giving a lecture tour sponsored by the International Statistical Institute. Wald greatly impressed Basu. Wald had developed a decision-theoretic foundations for statistics in which Bayesian statistics was a central part, because of Wald's theorem characterising admissible decision rules as Bayesian decision rules (or limits of Bayesian decision rules). Wald also showed the power of using measure-theoretic probability theory in statistics.\n\nHe married Kalyani Ray in 1952 and subsequently had two children, Monimala (Moni) Basu and Shantanu Basu. Moni is a journalism professor at the University of Florida and former CNN reporter, and Shantanu is an astrophysicist at the University of Western Ontario.\n\nIn 1953, after submitting his thesis to the University of Calcutta, Basu went as a Fulbright scholar to the University of California, Berkeley. There Basu had intensive discussions with Jerzy Neyman and \"his brilliant younger colleagues\" like Erich Leo Lehmann. Basu's theorem comes from this time. Basu thus had a good understanding of the decision-theoretic approach to statistics of Neyman, Pearson and Wald. In fact, Basu is described as having returned from Berkeley to India as a \"complete Neyman Pearsonian\" by J. K. Ghosh.\n\nBasu met Ronald Fisher in the winter of 1954–1955; he wrote in 1988, \"With his reference set argument, Sir Ronald was trying to find a via media between the two poles of Statistics – Berkeley and Bayes. My efforts to understand this Fisher compromise led me to the likelihood principle\". In their festschrift for Basu, the editors Malay Ghosh and Patak write that\n\n[Basu's] critical examination of both the Neyman–Pearsonian and the Fisherian modes of inference eventually forced him to a Bayesian point of view, via the likelihood route. The final conversion to Bayesianism came in January 1968, when Basu was invited to speak at a Bayesian Session in the Statistics Section of the Indian Science Congress. He confesses that, while preparing for these lectures, he became convinced that Bayesian inference did indeed provide one with a logical resolution of the underlying inconsistencies of both the Neyman–Pearson and the Fisherian theories. Since then, Dr. Basu became an ardent Bayesian and, in many of his foundation papers, pointed out the deficiencies of both the Neyman–Pearsonian and the Fisherian methods. \n\nAfter 1968, Basu began writing polemical essays, which provided paradoxes to frequentist statistics, and which produced great discussion in statistical journals and at statistical meetings. Particularly stimulating papers were Basu's papers on the foundations of survey sampling. There is an extensive literature discussing Basu's problem of estimating the weight of the elephants at a circus with an enormous bull elephant named Jumbo, which Basu used to illustrate his objections to the Horvitz–Thompson estimator and to Fisher's randomisation test.\n\nBasu taught at the Indian Statistical Institute and various universities around the world. He moved to the United States and taught statistics at Florida State University from 1975 to 1990 when he was made an emeritus professor; he has supervised six PhD students. In 1979 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.\n\nBasu's main articles are reprinted with his comments in Also \n\n"}

This self-directed learning is part of the constructivist model of student-centered learning advocated by member schools of the Canadian Coalition of Self-Directed Learning. \n\nThe school is a member of the Action for Bright Children Society.\n\nOpened in 1971, Bishop Carroll High School was the first school in Canada to offer a program based on the CCSDL fundamental practices of personalized programming, flexible scheduling, continuous progress, mastery learning and a Teacher Advisory Program. In 2011, Mount Royal University signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Bishop Carroll High School to build on a history of cooperation between the two institutions in order to enhance a working relationship that will increase educational opportunities for students. The MOU allows discussions to commence between the parties to offer specific courses at the high school (dual credit courses). Bishop Carroll High School students beginning in 2013 got a head start on their University studies with the successful completion of Critical Reading and Writing, a university-level credit course offered jointly by Mount Royal University and Bishop Carroll High School. This course was the first of its kind, and is part of a plan of continuing cooperation between the University and Bishop Carroll High School in many disciplines.
