{"id": "2228434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228434", "title": "Fictional universe of Harry Potter", "text": "Fictional universe of Harry Potter\n\nThe fictional universe of British author J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series of fantasy novels comprises two distinct societies: the Wizarding World and the Muggle world. In the novels, the Muggle world is the world inhabited by the non-magical majority, with which the Wizarding world exists coextensively, albeit mostly remaining hidden from the non-magical humans. The plot of the series is set in 1990s Britain, but in a veiled and separate shadow society wherein magic is commonly used and practised, and those who can use it live in self-enforced seclusion, hiding their abilities from the rest of the world. The term \"Wizarding World\" refers to the global wizard community that lives hidden in parallel with the Muggle world; the different terms refer to different communities within the same area rather than separate planets or worlds. Any new works taking place in this universe are released under the \"J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World\" brand.\n\nThe entire \"Harry Potter\" series is set from 1991 to 1998 aside from the opening chapter of the first book, which takes place on 1 November 1981, and the epilogue of the seventh book, which takes place on 1 September 2017. At various points throughout the Harry Potter timeline, flashbacks and flash-forwards depict the 1920s, the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1970s, the 1980s, the 2010s, and the 2020s. The depiction of the Wizarding World is centred on magic, which not only imbues objects such as wands, but is portrayed as an inborn ability. It is also centred on the separation of the wizarding world from the non-wizarding (Muggle) world. Despite being an inherent talent, magic is honed through study of various branches of magic and practical training into a skill.\n\nA great deal of effort is expended in keeping the Muggles unaware of magic. Originally the two worlds co-existed; however, persecution of those with magic meant laws have been put in place over the centuries, designed to keep the existence of the magical world hidden from Muggles. The first and most important statute is the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692. Enchantment of Muggle artefacts is forbidden; under-age wizards are restricted from using magic outside school, and any deliberate revelation of magical ability to the Muggle community is punishable. However, allowances are made for the use of magic in the presence of a Muggle in case of a life-threatening situation (for the wizard or the Muggle). These laws are enforced by the Ministry of Magic, while a special arm of it, the Obliviators, has the job of making certain that Muggles who have seen magic in action will be left with no \"inconvenient\" memories. Exceptions to the statute of secrecy include wizards' Muggle relatives and high-ranking political leaders; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for instance.\n\nAs seen in the first chapter of \"Philosopher's Stone\", jubilation and euphoria at Voldemort's first downfall in 1981 led to these rules being momentarily ignored and wizards exposing themselves gratuitously to muggles, who were greatly puzzled.\n\nSome aspects of the Wizarding World are depicted as being less-than-modern in comparison to the Muggle world, sometimes even old-fashioned or quaint. The technological development of the Wizarding World is substantially behind that of its Muggle counterpart — for instance, candles are used for illumination instead of electrical or gas bulbs/tubes – and owls, a more cumbersome and slower mode of communication, are used to send messages instead of simple phone calls. On the other hand, an owl can be sent to deliver a message without the sender needing to know the recipient's exact location or phone number.\n\nHowever, a large number of technologically complex devices do exist, and most of these devices exist in the Muggle world. From a certain perspective, it can be seen that Magic and electricity are the equivalents of each other in their respective worlds, but electronic equipment doesn't work around magic-filled areas, such as Hogwarts, and Muggle devices used by wizards (such as cameras and radios) can be made to function using magic instead of electricity. Such examples are rare, however; wizards rarely make use of Muggle technology, nor do they have much interest in doing so, even when such technology might make their lives much easier. Pure-blood Wizards are baffled by how Muggle technology works and most have no interest in understanding it (with occasional exceptions, such as Muggle aficionado Arthur Weasley, whose dearest ambition is \"to find out how an aeroplane stays up\"). \"Muggle Studies\" classes are offered at Hogwarts for those students with an interest. On several occasions, Harry Potter is tasked with having to explain the workings of commonplace Muggle technology, such as introducing the telephone to Mr Weasley in \"Chamber of Secrets\"; at the beginning of \"Prisoner of Azkaban\", Ron Weasley makes his first telephone call – with disastrous results for Harry.\n\nThe Wizarding World has also not embraced modern Muggle modes of information collection and transfer. For instance, instead of pen/pencil, paper and electronic equipment like computers, Hogwarts students use ink-dipped quills and parchment to take notes and do their homework. Wizarding money is also old-fashioned; whilst Muggle Britain was decimalised in 1971, Magical Britons continued with their system of 17 silver Sickles to a gold Galleon, and 29 bronze Knuts to a Sickle. Also, magical currency is all metal coins, and there is no paper money.\n\nThe magical world does have at least one train - the Hogwarts Express - pulled by a steam locomotive. There is radio but no television is shown. Magical brooms are mass-produced, with new models coming out regularly, similar to muggle cars. On the other hand, magical wands are hand made by skilled artisans, each individual wand taking long and painstaking labor. Printing is carried out by mechanical printing presses, rather than by magic (at least, the Quibbler is so produced).\n\nMany aspects of the British Wizarding World have Muggle equivalents. For example, after reaching age of 17 wizards can be licensed to apparate, while Muggles can learn and be licensed to drive cars. In the fifth and seventh years of Hogwarts or Muggle secondary school, external examinations take place. Some aspects of Muggle pop culture are also mirrored in the Wizarding World such as rock music, posters, and tabloids. A few young wizards embrace Muggle culture whole-heartedly: as a teenager, Sirius Black filled his room with pictures of Muggle pin-up girls, motorcycles and rock bands in rebellion against his prejudiced, Muggle-hating parents. Muggle music is heard in the film adaptation of \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" - music by The Ordinary Boys is heard playing in the background of the Gryffindor common room.\n\nWizards and witches who are Muggle-born, or are half-bloods (of mixed Muggle and magical parentage) find it easier (or even commonplace) to integrate into Muggle society and take on Muggle trends, as they are predisposed to Muggle ways growing up. Gryffindor student Dean Thomas has frequent references to the adorning of his part of the dormitory with posters of West Ham United Football Club. Albus Dumbledore has expressed interest in Muggle knitting patterns and ten-pin bowling.\n\nThere is no separate \"magical land\" in the \"Harry Potter\" universe; the wizarding world not only coexists alongside the world of Muggles, but also is embedded within it. Only one settlement in Britain, the village of Hogsmeade, is home to an entirely magical population. The vast majority of witches' and wizards' locations are integrated within the wider non-magical area. Wizards will often live in small communities of several families within Muggle villages such as Godric's Hollow in the West Country (home of the Dumbledores and the Potters) or Tinworth in Cornwall. The all-wizard Weasley, Diggory, Lovegood, and Fawcett families live near the Muggle village of Ottery St Catchpole, in Devon. Many wizarding houses in the \"Harry Potter\" books are depicted as being on the outskirts of towns, usually isolated from most of the town.\n\nSimilarly, the wizarding high street Diagon Alley lies in central London, just off Charing Cross Road. A train called the Hogwarts Express departs from the real King's Cross station, albeit from Platform 9¾. These locations are hidden by a combination of Muggle-repelling charms, illusions, and other magical protections. Many magical locations, such as the Isle of Drear off the coast of Scotland, or the Quidditch World Cup Stadium, and the wizarding prison, Azkaban, are rendered \"unplottable\", or impossible to locate on a map. This is further banked by the natural tendency of non-magical people to ignore anything they cannot explain or understand. Hogwarts Castle appears as abandoned ruins to any Muggles close enough to see. Although wizarding society lives for the most part directly alongside Muggles, interaction between the two communities is virtually non-existent since the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was introduced in 1692. Few wizards are aware of basic Muggle culture (for instance, most wizards do not understand Muggle clothing customs). On the odd occasions when it may be necessary for a wizard or witch to dress in Muggle clothing, the result is usually comical. While the series is set in Great Britain, there is evidence that the wizarding world has locations throughout the globe. This is shown in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", when it describes many people at the Quidditch World Cup speaking foreign languages. The number of Irish wizards working for the Ministry and attending Hogwarts, as well as the various nationalities attending Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, suggest the wizarding world's borders differ from the geopolitical divisions of the Muggle world. However, countries such as Bulgaria and Ireland have national teams representing them at the Quidditch World Cup - even though the muggles of these countries have no idea that the competition is taking place.\n\nIt is also suggested in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" that wizards played a part in ancient Egyptian history, and possibly are behind many historical wonders in the modern world such as the Egyptian pyramids and tombs.\n\nThe Wizarding World is home to many magical creatures and plants, some of which are familiar from folklore and myth. Giants, dragons, unicorns, boggarts, and goblins all have roles in the series, while many plants long believed to have magical properties, such as mandrake root, aconite, asphodel and wormwood, also make appearances. Within the stories, the conceit is that these creatures and their magical powers are real, but have been hidden for centuries from the non-magical world by the efforts of wizards, to the point where they have faded into folklore. In Hogwarts, some types of pets are allowed: cats, owls, rats, and toads. J.K. Rowling wrote a spin-off book about magical creatures to complement the main \"Harry Potter\" novels, titled \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\".\n\nIn both the book \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" and the movie of the same name, laws governing magical creatures are often referenced. Like any laws, these are changed over time, and vary from country to country.\n\nThere are three distinct definitions for all magical creatures given in the \"Fantastic Beasts\" book, which are \"Beasts\", \"Beings\" and \"Spirits\" (spirits being for ghosts) which were defined in 1811 by the British Minister for Magic. \"Beings\" are defined as \"any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws\".\n\nLaws have been created surrounding the management of magical creatures, largely for the purposes of their protection, but also to protect wizards from dangerous creatures, govern ownership of certain creatures, and also to hide them from the Muggle world. In the \"Fantastic Beasts\" movie the political climate of the wizarding community at the time saw a blanket ban on possessing all magical creatures.\n\nThe longstanding separation between the wizarding and Muggle worlds in the \"Harry Potter\" universe has led many wizards to advocate keeping the two apart. This view has, in turn, led to a minority of British wizards seeing Muggles (and wizards of pure Muggle parentage) as untrustworthy, foolish, or, in extreme cases, racially inferior. The common practice of wizards marrying Muggles is viewed by such extremists as miscegenation, and they instead advocate maintaining a so-called \"purity of blood\". This was part of Lord Voldemort's ideology, and the Black family disowned anyone who married a half-blood or muggle. However, in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\", Hagrid and Ron both state there is probably no such factor as \"blood purity\", with all wizards (given sufficient research) likely to find in their family history some marriages to Muggles.\n\nPure-blood is the term applied to wizards and witches who have no Muggle blood, Muggle-borns, or half-bloods at all in their family tree. They are the rarest of the three blood statuses, with J.K. Rowling saying 10% of the Wizarding community is made up of pure-bloods. Although technically pure-bloods have no Muggle ancestors, the small wizarding population means that \"true\" pure-bloods are rare, with some just ignoring or disowning the few Muggles in their family. Identified pure-blood families include the Blacks, the Crouches, the Fudges, the Gaunts (though that line died out before the beginning of \"Philosopher's Stone\"), the Lestranges, the Longbottoms, the Malfoys, and the Weasleys (but the most recent generation has had half-blood members). To maintain their blood purity, some supremacist families have been known to inbreed into their own families by marrying their cousins, resulting sometimes in mental instability and violent natures. The Gaunt family displayed both tendencies by the time of the sixth book.\n\nPure-blood supremacists believe blood purity is a measure of a wizard's magical ability – notwithstanding examples of skilled Muggle-born witches and wizards such as Hermione Granger and Lily Potter – and less skilled pure-bloods such as Neville Longbottom (whose skills developed in \"Deathly Hallows\" due to his heroism) – and Muggles to be low-life, having no magic in them. Supremacists apply the term \"blood traitor\" to pure-bloods who married and had children with non-pure-bloods.\n\nThe pure-blood wizards and witches in the \"Harry Potter\" books are almost all supremacists, while there are some of them who don't advocate ancestral superiority; the Weasleys, Potters, and Longbottoms are old pure-blood families, but no known members of these families are sympathetic to supremacist aims. The Black family, traditionally pure-blood supremacists, also seem to have produced one or two such \"black sheep\" in every generation, namely Sirius and Andromeda (Bellatrix and Narcissa's sister who married the Muggle-born Ted Tonks).\n\nSeveral wizards question the notion of blood purity altogether. In his copy of \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" (later bequeathed to Hermione Granger), Dumbledore has made annotations that he thinks the much-vaunted blood purity does not exist, and is only a fiction maintained by the deceptions of supremacist wizards.\n\nHalf-blood refers to those wizards and witches who have magical and Muggle ancestors in their family trees. Half-bloods are the most common wizard blood, far outnumbering pure-bloods and Muggle-borns. Rowling has stated that, of the Hogwarts annual intake, 50% are half-bloods. Pure-blood supremacists view half-bloods as inferior to them, although superior to Muggles and Muggle-borns. The Malfoy family, a family of wealthy Wizards who showed disdain to Muggles, attempted to maintain blood purity, but found it acceptable to marry half-bloods if there was a dearth of marriageable pure-bloods.\n\nVoldemort is a half-blood, and his most guarded secret which few Wizards know is that his father was Tom Riddle, a Muggle. Severus Snape is also a half-blood (he gave himself the nickname \"The Half-Blood Prince\"), as his father Tobias Snape was a Muggle. Harry himself is a half-blood, since his pure-blood father, James, married a Muggle-born woman named Lily, and his maternal grandparents were Muggles.\n\nMuggle-born is the term applied to wizards and witches whose parents were Muggles. J.K. Rowling has said they are second-most common of the three types of blood status wizards, numbering about 25% in the Wizarding community. They are often believed to be descended from Squibs who married Muggles, and the dormant magical gene may resurface after a couple of generations. Harry Potter's mother, Lily Evans, was a Muggle-born. Unlike children of Wizarding families who get a Hogwarts acceptance letter from an owl, a Hogwarts employee will usually hand-deliver the letter to Muggle-borns in order to meet the Muggle parents and explain.\n\nSupremacists typically believe Muggle-borns to be magically deficient, despite examples to the contrary, such as Hermione and Lily, who are exceptionally skilled in their abilities.\n\nPureblood supremacists refer to Muggle-borns with the offensive derogatory term Mudblood. Hagrid was shocked to find out that Draco Malfoy uttered the term to Hermione in order to insult and provoke her, since the slur is never used in proper conversations. Hermione, after being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange, due to her blood status, decided to reclaim use of the term \"Mudblood\" with pride instead of shame in an effort to defuse its \nvalue as a slur.\n\nDuring Voldemort's rule, Muggle-borns were legally required to register with the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, headed by Dolores Umbridge. During this time, the Department of Mysteries claimed that Muggle-borns acquired their magic by stealing magic and wands from \"real\" wizards. Other wizards and witches rejected this notion, such as Ron Weasley, who asks how such an accusation can be proven. After the fall of Voldemort, Dolores Umbridge is imprisoned in Azkaban, with the other members of the commission either imprisoned or becoming fugitives.\n\nSquib is the term applied to a child who is born of magical parents, but who develops no magical abilities. They are considered to be the opposite of Muggle-born wizards/witches. Squib births are rare: the only Squibs noted as such in the books are Argus Filch, Arabella Figg, and Molly Weasley's second cousin, who was an accountant. The Ministry does not require them to be registered as part of the community. Squibs share some things with wizards and they are aware of and comprehend the wizarding World. They can also see Hogwarts and Dementors, which ordinary Muggles cannot. However, according to Ron's Aunt Muriel, the custom with Squibs has been to send them to Muggle schools and encourage them to integrate into the Muggle world, which is \"much kinder\" than keeping them in the wizarding world where they will always be \"second-class\". In contrast to most of the wizarding world's acceptance and even respect for Muggles and Muggle-born wizards and witches, it is often considered embarrassing to have a Squib in the family. Neville once said that his family originally thought he was a Squib, until his great-uncle Algie dropped him out of a second-story window and Neville bounced down the road. Albus Dumbledore's sister, Ariana, was inaccurately rumored to be a squib.\n\nSome wizards are the products of unions between humans and magical creatures of more-or-less human intelligence, such as Fleur Delacour and her sister Gabrielle (both quarter veela), Professor Flitwick (a quarter goblin), and Madame Maxime and Hagrid (both half giant). Prejudiced wizards (such as Umbridge) often use the insulting term half-breed to refer to mixed-species wizards and werewolves, or to other beings such as house elves, merpeople and centaurs (who are separate species). The centaurs within the series prefer to exist amongst themselves, with little interaction with humans.\n\nThe Ministry of Magic is the government for the magical community of Britain. The government is first mentioned in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\". The Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, is the first minister to make an appearance in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\". The Ministry itself is not shown until \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\". As the books progress, the Ministry becomes more corrupt and blind to happenings in the Wizard world, reaching a nadir of corruption during Voldemort's uprising.\n\nKnown Ministers for Magic include Millicent Bagnold (before the books begin), Cornelius Fudge, Rufus Scrimgeour, Pius Thicknesse (under the Imperius Curse, controlled indirectly by Lord Voldemort), Kingsley Shacklebolt (at first temporarily, but later known to be permanent) and Hermione Granger.\n\nThe Muggles remain, for the most part, oblivious to the wizarding world. This situation is considered preferable to the alternative by wizards. Most things of magical nature are hidden or otherwise obscured from Muggles; others, such as Dementors, are invisible to them, although they experience the same depression and sense of manifest darkness and despair while near a Dementor. It is commented that Muggles generally dismiss anything they cannot explain. Likewise, to many magical people, many functional aspects of the Muggle world are rarely glimpsed and mysterious. Wizards and witches' attempts to disguise themselves as Muggles, as when they have to venture out onto \"normal\" streets, often have humorous results. When magic is seen in the muggle world, the Ministry of Magic is often tasked with clean-up. The mispronunciation of common Muggle terms like \"telephone\", \"escalator\", \"plumber\", \"firearms\" or \"policeman\", as \"fellytone\", \"escapator\", \"pumble\", \"firelegs\", and \"please-men\", respectively, is a running gag in the series. Arthur Weasley is known for being fascinated with the muggle world and has a vast collection of muggle objects.\n\nMuggle Studies is an option of study at Hogwarts. However, while some professions require its study, to others it is often considered a \"soft option\". Hermione surprised Harry by taking the course, as her parents are Muggles. She explained that she thought it would be \"fascinating\" to study Muggles from the wizarding point of view.\n\nThe only official relations described with the Muggle world are between the Minister for Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister. In \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" it is revealed that the Minister for Magic privately introduces himself to each new Prime Minister. There is a magical painting in the Prime Minister's office that notifies him of such visits, and a fireplace that is connected to the Floo Network, which is how the Minister for Magic travels to the Prime Minister's office. Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge informed the Prime Minister of the escape of Sirius Black. Fudge also informed the Prime Minister that several problems he was facing were rooted in the war against Voldemort, and that the Prime Minister's new secretary Kingsley Shacklebolt was an Auror. Fudge treats the Muggle Prime Minister with condescension, and the Muggle Prime Minister is often frustrated by the Minister for Magic.\n\nThe exact extent to which the secrecy and isolation of the wizarding world is maintained varies. Many references are made to the Ministry of Magic performing memory charms to preserve secrecy; however, some Muggles have necessary interactions with the wizarding world. Hermione's parents are Muggles, but have been seen in Diagon Alley. They are fully aware that magic exists, but they forbade Hermione to use magic to fix her teeth (as dentists, they felt that this was cheating). The Dursleys are also aware of the Wizarding World; Petunia Dursley indicates that she learned of it when her sister, Lily, was accepted for Hogwarts. She shared this information with her husband, who is shown to be contemptuous of the wizarding world even before Harry shows up at their doorstep. There is no indication that Dudley was aware of this until Harry is told about Hogwarts.\n\nAlong with the families of Muggle-born wizards, there are mixed marriages. Seamus Finnigan reports that his mother was a witch who did not inform his Muggle father of her magical abilities until after they were married.\n\nThere is also some unspecified financial relationship between the two worlds, as it is possible to exchange Muggle money into wizard money. Hermione's parents are shown doing this in the second book.\n\nIn \"Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban\", Harry writes an essay on medieval witch burning, which was cited as the reason behind the introduction of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, and wizards going into hiding from the Muggle world.\n\nThis is further explored in other novels, and is notably covered in some depth in \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\", where Albus Dumbledore writes notes after each story that often concern Wizard-Muggle relationships. Part of these 'observations' note how The Tales were modified in the face of anti-Muggle sentiments, in order to remove any pro-Muggle messages for wizards who did not want their children exposed to those messages. This included Lucius Malfoy, who demanded that the Tales be removed from the Hogwarts syllabus.\n\n\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" shows that different wizarding governments around the world may have different levels of relationships with Muggles depending on their social and political climate, and that these relationships may even change over time like other political policies. In the movie, Newt Scamander describes American wizarding law in regard to Muggles as \"rather backward\", and further explains that American wizards are forbidden from having any contact or relationships with Muggles.\n\nSince a person's most important capability – magical aptitude – does not depend on sex, sexual equality is highly advanced in the Wizarding World, and the \"battle of the sexes\" never became much of an issue (for example, Quidditch teams have both male and female players – except for a known example, the Holyhead Harpies, which are an all-female team).\n\nThe most obvious example of wizard prejudice is a longstanding disdain, even a genocidal hatred, toward Muggles and wizards and witches of Muggle parentage (Muggle-borns, half-bloods) among certain wizards. This has led to a eugenic philosophy among some of the older wizarding families, leading to a practice of \"pure-blood\" intermarriage that has exposed many of them (such as the Gaunt family) to the risks of mental instability.\n\nOther internal tensions include the slavery of house elves and the suspicion or disregard for some species of near-human intelligence (\"beings\" in Wizard parlance). Voldemort and his allies frequently exploit these divisions to bring non-human magical creatures, particularly werewolves and giants, over to their cause.\n\nThe magical governments of the world are to some degree united in the International Confederation of Wizards. This organisation has many responsibilities, mostly to enforce the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.\n\nThere is a reference to the Ministry of Magic's Department of International Magical Cooperation\nand to various international bodies such as the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, the International Confederation of Wizards and the International Quidditch Association.\n\nAs noted in the depiction of the Quidditch World Championship in \"Goblet of Fire\", Irish and Bulgarian wizards (and presumably, also those from other countries) can feel a strong national pride and be intensely eager for their country to win – even though Irish and Bulgarian Muggles, who form most of the population in the two countries, are not aware that the Championship is taking place.\n\nThe books do not refer to the degree to which wars and tensions between Muggle governments (e.g., the World Wars or the Cold War) influence the relations between the respective wizarding governments. However, Rowling has strongly implied that the rise of the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald and his defeat by Dumbledore in 1945 were related to the rise and fall of the Third Reich.\n\nThere appears to be no official precursor to a magical education; apparently, wizard parents home-school their children in basic non-magical topics, such as literacy and arithmetic. Muggle-born wizards (or Muggle-raised wizards), however, clearly experience an ordinary Muggle primary education before enrolling at Hogwarts, something that could be viewed as either a cognitive edge or a disadvantage. There are also no compulsory educational laws that exist in the British Wizarding World. Parents may continue to home-school their children, send them to Hogwarts, or send them abroad to other wizarding schools. However, during the time Voldemort had overthrown the Ministry of Magic, attendance at Hogwarts was compulsory, so that his followers could have complete control over the wizarding youth.\n\nFollowing completion of a Hogwarts education, there is no standard tertiary education, and there are no wizard universities. Successful Hogwarts students are considered ready to function as adults, though some wizarding professions do require special, years-long training programmes after finishing Hogwarts. These include the professions of the Auror and the Healer (the wizard physician). Sometimes, the young travel the world to \"observe foreign witches and wizards\" after graduation to complete their education. In the \"Deathly Hallows\", Elphias Doge describes how his plans to travel the world with his friend Dumbledore were disrupted by the death of the latter's mother. Similarly, Professor Quirrell took time off to gain first-hand experience after a celebrated academic career.\n\nThe Wizarding Examinations Authority is an organisation responsible for examining students in their fifth and seventh years taking their O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. exams. These relate to the Muggle world's GCSE and A-Level examinations in English, Welsh and Northern Irish schools (National 5 and Higher in Scottish schools) in the UK. The head of the authority, Griselda Marchbanks, is an elderly witch who examined a school-aged Dumbledore in his N.E.W.T.s.\n\nOrdinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.s) are wizarding examinations taken in the fifth year. O.W.Ls affect what jobs a witch or wizard is eligible for after school, and are presided over by the Wizarding Examinations Authority (see above).\n\nNastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests(N.E.W.T.s) are wizarding examinations taken in the seventh year. N.E.W.T.s are the final tests to see what jobs a witch or wizard is eligible for. While Hermione goes back to Hogwarts to take her exams in the aftermath of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", Harry and Ron never take their N.E.W.T.s. In spite of this, Harry manages to become the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at some point in the future.\n\n\nA fictional system of currency is used by the wizards of the United Kingdom. The currency uses only coins as the units of account. It is based on three types of coin; in order of decreasing value, the gold Galleon, the silver Sickle, and the bronze Knut. Wizarding banks provide money-changing services for those with Muggle currency. The only bank seen in the \"Harry Potter\" series is Gringotts, which is located in Diagon Alley in London and has hundreds of vaults. Account-holders may use these vaults to store anything they wish. Hagrid indicates that wizards have \"just the one\" bank, and considers Gringotts to be the most secure place to store valuable or sensitive items aside from Hogwarts.\n\nSome Gringotts employees are stationed in countries other than England and tasked with recovering treasure for use by the bank. Bill Weasley is introduced as one such employee, working in Egypt as a Charm-Breaker to extract riches from ancient tombs.\n\nThe Galleon is the largest and most valuable coin in the British wizard currency. It is gold, round and larger than the other coins in use.\n\nAround the rim of the Galleon is inscribed at least one serial number, which identifies the goblin who was responsible for minting the coin. In \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", Hermione enchants fake Galleons to show the time and date of the next Dumbledore's Army meeting instead of the serial number.\n\nAs explained in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" there are 17 silver Sickles to a gold Galleon, and 29 bronze Knuts to a Sickle.\n\nAccording to Pottermore, the wizards never changed their units of measurement (i.e. feet to metres, ounces to grams, pounds to kilograms, etc.) because they can do the calculations with magic, so strange number conversions do not bother them.\n\nIn a 2001 interview, J. K. Rowling said a Galleon was approximately five pounds (at the time of the interview approximately US$7.50 or €5.50), although \"the exchange rate varies.\"\n\nIn the book \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", it is said that the £174 million raised for charity is equivalent to 34,000,872 Galleons, 14 Sickles, and 7 Knuts (the figure is truncated to \"over thirty-four million Galleons\" in \"Quidditch Through the Ages\"). This means that £5.12 = 1 galleon. However, the book's cover price is £2.50 ($3.99 US), or \"14 Sickles and 3 Knuts,\" which implies either an exchange rate of £3.01 = 1 galleon or a 41% discount to Muggle purchasers.\n\nSports, specifically Quidditch, play an important role in the Wizarding world, and in the \"Harry Potter\" series. Quidditch is a team sport played up in the air on brooms. Wizards all around the globe fanatically follow it in a similar manner to football, and the Quidditch World Cup is a major event on the wizard calendar.\n\nNot long into his first year at Hogwarts, Harry proves himself a talented Quidditch player and is named to the Gryffindor team as its Seeker, with the role of finding and catching the Golden Snitch. His activities on the Quidditch pitch feature prominently in several of the books. Lee Jordan, two years older than Harry, serves as the commentator for the Quidditch matches at Hogwarts until he graduates. The sport appears in every book except the seventh; school matches are canceled in the fourth due to the need to use the pitch for the Triwizard Tournament, but Harry attends the Quidditch World Cup as a guest of the Weasley family.\n\nOther wizard games and sports include Gobstones (a version of marbles in which the stones squirt foul-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a point), Exploding Snap (a card game in which the cards explode), and Wizard Chess (in which the pieces are sentient and under the command of the player). The wizarding world is also home to a number of other wizard spectator sports, such as Creaothceann (a now-banned broom game from Scotland in which players try to catch rocks with cauldrons strapped to their heads), Quodpot (a popular game in the United States involving a Quaffle that explodes), and broom racing.\n\nSeveral magical communication methods are available to the wizarding world.\n\nBy far the most popular method of communication is via owls. Owls are used for conveying packages, with multiple owls acting in concert to deliver heavier packages. Owls also deliver mail and newspapers, acting as a replacement for the postal service of the Muggle world. If an owl delivers something for which payment is expected, such as a newspaper, the recipient places the money in a small pouch attached to the owl's leg. Not only owls may be used; Sirius Black makes use of a tropical bird, likely a macaw, on one occasion. The Ministry of Magic regulates Owl Mail.\n\nHow the owls find the recipients of the letters they carry is not specifically stated. In some circumstances, letters have extremely explicit addresses on them (specifying rooms or locations inside of a building). Other times, there is no mention of an address, and the owl is simply told to whom to deliver. The Ministry of Magic used to use owls to deliver inter-office mail within the ministry building, but according to Mr. Weasley, the mess was incredible. Now the ministry uses enchanted memos, which fly throughout the building as paper aeroplanes, rather than owls.\n\nIn addition, though owls are portrayed as flying directly to the recipient of their package, it is implied that owl traffic can be monitored and even interrupted. There are several references to \"the owls being watched\" and Harry uses different owls to communicate with Sirius (his godfather) since his snowy owl, Hedwig, would supposedly attract too much attention. On one occasion Hedwig is injured after being intercepted and searched (supposedly by Umbridge).\n\nA Patronus is primarily used to repel Dementors. They can also be used for communication by accomplished witches and wizards. Albus Dumbledore devised a method of using Patronuses to deliver vocal messages, putting this to the exclusive use of the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Arthur Weasley all deliver messages via Patronus in the course of the series. McGonagall is also the only character in the series to have shown the ability to project multiple Patronuses to send multiple messages. Patronuses are also the only known way of repelling Lethifolds.\n\nSeverus Snape used his Patronus to lead Harry Potter to the forest pool wherein Gryffindor's sword was hidden in \"The Deathly Hallows\".\n\nWhile the Floo Network (a play on the word 'flue') is intended for use as a method of transport, it also occasionally serves as a method of communication. A wizard can throw a pinch of Floo Powder into a lit fireplace connected to the Network and put his/her head into the flames, causing it to appear in the fireplace of the wizard with whom he/she intends to speak. This use of the Network is first seen in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" when Harry sees Amos Diggory's head in the Weasleys' fireplace at The Burrow, talking to Molly Weasley. Harry also uses this method to communicate with Sirius Black on several occasions during the series.\n\nThe etiquette surrounding using the fireplace for communication is not explicitly addressed in the series. Dumbledore tells Harry it is not polite for a wizard to apparate (appear out of thin air) directly into another wizard's house. However, at one point Harry uses Floo Powder to contact Grimmauld Place unannounced. Severus Snape uses a fireplace to contact Remus Lupin and tell him he wants a word, before speaking to him in person in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\".\n\nLord Voldemort uses a method of communication called the Dark Mark, which is like a brand on the inner forearms of the Death Eaters. When the mark is pressed, contact is made with other Death Eaters and Voldemort himself. Pressing one's Dark Mark causes every other Death Eater's mark to burn, signalling them to Disapparate from wherever they were and immediately Apparate to Voldemort's side.\n\nThose who follow Voldemort consider the Dark Mark to be of great importance, and while some people are 'lucky' enough to have one, the privilege is restricted to those of 'pure' blood. It is stated that Fenrir Greyback (a vicious werewolf) is not allowed the Dark Mark, which is likely because he is a werewolf.\n\nHermione uses the principle of the Dark Mark in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\". Instead of burning/engraving the message into the members of Dumbledore's Army's skin, she uses fake Galleons which all mimic each other and have messages on the rim. Later Malfoy and Madam Rosmerta, who was under the Imperius Curse, used Galleons to contact each other.\n\nApart from the fake Galleons enchanted by Hermione for Dumbledore's Army, there are a few other methods of closed-channel communications used in the books and films. Subjects painted into wizarding portraits are frequently used to carry messages between locations where their portraits hang. Phineas Nigellus (former Hogwarts headmaster and member of the Black Family) is used to send messages between Dumbledore's office and his other portrait in Grimmauld Place. Hermione takes Phineas from Grimmauld Place during \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" and uses Phineas to obtain information about events at Hogwarts. Dumbledore also uses two other former headmasters in a similar fashion when Arthur Weasley is attacked by Nagini in the Ministry of Magic. A portrait is also seen carrying messages between the Minister for Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister in the opening of \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\".\n\nAnother form of closed communication used in the books and movies is a set of mirrors which belonged to Sirius Black. Sirius gives Harry one mirror in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", with a note explaining to Harry that Sirius and James Potter used to use the mirrors to talk to each other when they were put in separate detentions. In \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", Harry uses a shard of his broken mirror to call for help from the Malfoy's cellar, and later finds out that Aberforth Dumbledore had been watching over Harry using Sirius' mirror, which he obtained from Mundungus Fletcher.\n\nFlying paper aeroplanes (referred to as \"interdepartmental memos\") are used within the Ministry of Magic. In \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" when Arthur Weasley takes Harry to the Ministry of Magic, Mr. Weasley explains that these took the place of the owls to minimise the mess. They are pale violet with MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of the wings. A variation on this method of communication is shown in the movie version of \"Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban\", when Draco Malfoy sends Harry a note in class in the form of a flying paper crane.\n\nWizards and witches often Apparate to their destinations, which is quite similar to teleportation. It is quite difficult to Apparate; therefore underage wizards and witches are forbidden to do it. There are many examples of failed Apparition attempts made by people who have not passed their \"Apparition test\", which is like a Muggle driving test. If not Apparating correctly, a person may lose a body part in the process, referred to as \"splinching\". In \"Deathly Hallows\", Ron gets splinched after being grabbed by Yaxley, a Death Eater. Hermione heals him with a liquid – essence of dittany – that she carried in her bag, a process which takes several days. Bob Ogden, once the head of Magical Law Enforcement, after being attacked by Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt, apparated back to his headquarters, returning with several more policemen to subdue the lawbreakers.\n\nCharacters in the series make use of several magical devices and artefacts to transport themselves within the Wizarding World and to the Muggle world. Among the most common of these objects are broomsticks, the Floo Network (a network of fireplaces magically connected to one another), the Knight Bus, and the Hogwarts Express. Some characters have been known to enchant Muggle vehicles to have magical features, such as Arthur Weasley's Ford Anglia or Sirius Black's Flying Motorbike. In \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", a discussion is held around the politics of importing flying carpets.\n\nPortkeys are used if witches or wizards are unable to Apparate, whether that be because they are unable to or because they have an underage witch or wizard in their company. Portkeys can be almost anything, usually a mundane, everyday object that would easily be overlooked by a muggle. Using the charm \"Portus,\" they are able to carry the user to their destination, so long as the user has hold of the object upon leaving. Portkeys are able to carry multiple people at once, an example being in \"The Goblet of Fire\" when Harry, Hermione Granger, the Weasleys and the Diggorys travel to the Quidditch World Cup. Portkeys are usually disguised as rubbish such as a tin can or old sock so Muggles won't notice them.\n\nThestrals are skeletal, winged horses, black in colour, which can only be seen by those who have witnessed death firsthand. They pull the Hogwarts school coaches and can also be tamed and ridden. This method of transportation was used in \"Order of the Phoenix\", when members of the Dumbledore's Army needed to go to the Ministry of Magic to rescue Sirius Black, and also used when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' house to The Burrow in \"Deathly Hallows\". Other magical birds have also been known to be flown; for instance Fawkes the phoenix by Harry, Ron, Ginny and Lockhart in \"Chamber of Secrets\" and Buckbeak the hippogriff by Harry, Hermione and Sirius in \"Prisoner of Azkaban.\"\n\nThe Daily Prophet is the most widely read daily newspaper in Britain's wizard community. The articles include moving pictures. Its journalistic integrity is lacking; it has been known to be more concerned about sales than about factual accuracy and is often a mouthpiece for the Ministry of Magic; as described by Rita Skeeter, \"\"The Prophet\" exists to sell itself!\"\n\nThe \"Prophet\" remains respectable for the first three books, but by \"Goblet of Fire\", it has hired Rita Skeeter, an unscrupulous journalist who supplies several thrilling and blatantly false articles. These include an article that, while correctly asserting that Hagrid is part giant, also makes numerous scurrilous accusations about his personal character, and declares Harry \"disturbed and dangerous\" based on remarks by Draco Malfoy. When Minister Fudge takes the stance of firmly denying Voldemort's return, the \"Prophet\" initiates a smear campaign against Dumbledore and Harry, the most influential proponents of the opposing view. After Fudge is forced to admit that Voldemort has returned, the \"Prophet\" changes its stance overnight, calling Harry \"a lone voice of truth\". The newspaper even buys, from \"The Quibbler\", Harry's interview on Voldemort's return and claims it to be exclusive.\n\nThe editor of \"The Daily Prophet\" is Barnabas Cuffe, a former pupil of the Potions master Horace Slughorn. It is unclear how long he has been editor of \"The Daily Prophet\". According to J. K. Rowling, in the events after the book series, Ginny Weasley becomes Senior Quidditch correspondent at \"The Daily Prophet\", after her retirement from the Holyhead Harpies. \"The Daily Prophet\" has a late edition named \"The Evening Prophet\", and a weekend edition named \"The Sunday Prophet\".\n\nThe Warner Bros. \"Harry Potter\" website's news and events page has been named after the paper.\n\nThe Quibbler is a magazine first mentioned in \"Order of the Phoenix\".\n\nThe magazine's editor is Xenophilius Lovegood. \"The Quibbler\" mainstays are conspiracy theories and cryptozoology. Articles in \"The Quibbler\" have claimed that Fudge has had goblins cooked in pies, and uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he supposedly feeds to people who disagree with him, and that he has a secret army of fire-demons called \"heliopaths\". Numerous (presumably imaginary) beasts are mentioned in \"The Quibbler\", such as Crumple-Horned Snorkacks (which supposedly live in Sweden and cannot fly), the Blibbering Humdinger and Nargles (which are supposed to infest mistletoe).\n\nIn \"Order of the Phoenix\", Hermione blackmails Rita Skeeter into writing an article about Harry's encounter with Voldemort. The interview is published by Xenophilius, and he later sells it to the \"Daily Prophet\" for a good price (enough to finance an expedition to Sweden to hunt for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack). In \"Deathly Hallows\", Xenophilius continues to support Harry in his magazine until his daughter Luna gets kidnapped to silence him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Xenophilius for information but discover that the latest issue features an anti-Harry story on the cover. Following Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the \"Quibbler\" goes back to its condition of advanced lunacy and becomes popular, still being appreciated for its unintentional humour.\n\nThe most popular radio station is the \"Wizarding Wireless Network\". Harry learns about the popular wizarding band \"The Weird Sisters\" from his peers that listen to the WWN. Over Christmas with the Weasley family during \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", the Weasley family listens to Celestina Warbeck on the network.\n\nIn \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\", Ron introduces Harry and Hermione to \"Potterwatch. Potterwatch\" is an underground anti-Voldemort radio program which is only accessible with a secret password. The \"Potterwatch\" episode that the trio listen to features various members of the Order of the Phoenix and is hosted by Lee Jordan.\n\nThe following are food and beverages unique to the wizarding world:\n\nMultitudes of sweets are referred to in the stories; many have a violent or bizarre side effect, especially those created by Fred and George Weasley. Most sweets can be found in the sweetshop Honeydukes. Dumbledore seems to be partial to these as he often uses their names as passwords.\n\nChocolate Frogs are, as the name suggests, frogs made of chocolate, and are very popular wizarding sweets. They are each packaged with a collectible card displaying a magical picture and brief biography of a famous witch or wizard of medieval to modern times. Cards named in the \"Harry Potter\" series include wizards such as Merlin, Dumbledore, Nicholas Flamel and the four founders of Hogwarts. According to a web chat with the author, Harry and his friends are eventually featured on a series of Chocolate Frog cards; Ron calling it \"his finest hour\".\n\nSome of the most notable magical sweets such as Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans, Skiving Snackboxes and Cockroach Clusters have been manufactured in real life, mainly by the Jelly Belly candy company. They have produced real versions of Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans odd flavours in and out of the market since 2001. Apart from some \"regular\" flavours, the company also produces several \"unusual\" flavours mentioned in the books. Other flavours include bacon, dirt, earthworm, earwax, vomit, rotten egg, sausage, pickle, toast, grass and soap.\n\nA description of Honeydukes in the third book says that the store sells candies called Coconut Ice, Ice Mice (which make your teeth chatter and squeak), Fizzing Whizbees, Pepper Imps (which allow you to breathe fire on your friends), Sugar Quills, Cockroach Clusters, self-flossing mints, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum (which make a room fill up with bluebell-coloured bubbles which wouldn't pop for days), Peppermint Creams shaped like toads (which hop in your stomach), Exploding Bonbons, Jelly Slugs, Acid Pops, and blood-flavoured lollipops.\n\nButterbeer is the drink of choice for younger wizards. Harry is first presented with the beverage in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\". Although house-elves can become intoxicated on Butterbeer, the amount of alcohol contained in Butterbeer has a negligible effect on Witches and Wizards. J.K. Rowling said in her interview to \"Bon Appétit\" magazine that she imagines it \"to taste a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch\". Butterbeer can be served cold or hot, but either way it has a warming effect.\n\nThe earliest reference to buttered beer is from \"The Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchin\", published in London in 1588. It was made from beer, sugar, eggs, nutmeg, cloves and butter. Another old recipe for buttered beer, published by Robert May in 1664 from his recipe book \"The Accomplisht Cook\", calls for liquorice root and aniseed to be added. British celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal recreated the drink for his show \"Heston's Tudor Feast\".\n\nIt was announced in April 2010 that a drink named after butterbeer would be sold in the theme park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando. The beverage is also sold at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London. It has a sweet taste and is a non-alcoholic beverage. It was taste-tested by J. K. Rowling herself. According to Neil Genzlinger, a staff editor on the culture desk of \"The New York Times\", the beverage \"is indistinguishable from a good quality cream soda\".\n\nFirewhisky is a type of alcohol that wizards under the age of seventeen are not allowed to drink; however, this rule is not always followed. Firewhisky is described as burning the drinkers' throats as they consume it.\n\nIt can be seen as a very strong whisky, and by all intents is used as such. The characters drink it in the last book when Mad-Eye Moody dies in flight, to numb the shock and toast to his life. Hagrid also drinks it, although in much larger quantities.\n\nPumpkin juice is a cold drink favoured by the Wizarding world, and among the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is drunk at any occasion, such as breakfast, lunch, at feasts or on other occasions. It seems to have taken on the same role that orange juice has to Muggles.\n\nPumpkin juice is readily available, and can be purchased on the Hogwarts Express. Severus Snape threatened to Harry in his fourth year that he might slip Veritaserum in his morning pumpkin juice while believing that Harry had stolen some of Snape's potion ingredients. Prior to a Quidditch match in his sixth year, Ron Weasley believed that Harry had slipped Felix Felicis into his morning juice to help him play perfectly.\n\nPumpkin juice is one of several speciality beverages developed for Universal's Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park (along with butterbeer, see above). According to a preview by \"The New York Times\"' Neil Genzlinger, \"Pumpkin juice (in a cute, pumpkin-topped bottle) is far more interesting [than the park's butterbeer], perhaps because the actual pumpkin content seems minimal – it’s more like a feisty apple cider with a little pumpkin thrown in.\"\n\nGillywater is a beverage sold in the \"Harry Potter\" universe. Professor McGonagall drinks this in \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2228439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228439", "title": "Genetic redundancy", "text": "Genetic redundancy\n\nGenetic redundancy is a term typically used to describe situations where a given biochemical function is redundantly encoded by two or more genes. In these cases, mutations (or defects) in one of these genes will have a smaller effect on the fitness of the organism than expected from the genes’ function. Characteristic examples of genetic redundancy include (Enns, Kanaoka et al. 2005) and (Pearce, Senis et al. 2004). Many more examples are thoroughly discussed in (Kafri, Levy & Pilpel. 2006).\n\nThe main source of genetic redundancy is the process of gene duplication which generates multiplicity in gene copy number. A second and less frequent source of genetic redundancy are convergent evolutionary processes leading to genes that are close in function but unrelated in sequence (Galperin, Walker & Koonin 1998). Genetic redundancy is typically associated with signaling networks, in which many proteins act together to accomplish teleological functions. In contrast to expectations, genetic redundancy is not associated with gene duplications [Wagner, 2007], neither do redundant genes mutate faster than essential genes [Hurst 1999]. Therefore, genetic redundancy has classically aroused much debate in the context of evolutionary biology (Nowak et al., 1997; Kafri, Springer & Pilpel . 2009).\n\nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, genes with overlapping functions implies minimal, if any, selective pressures acting on these genes. One therefore expects that the genes participating in such buffering of mutations will be subject to severe mutational drift diverging their functions and/or expression patterns with considerably high rates. Indeed it has been shown that the functional divergence of paralogous pairs in both yeast and human is an extremely rapid process. Taking these notions into account, the very existence of genetic buffering, and the functional redundancies required for it, presents a paradox in light of the evolutionary concepts. On one hand, for genetic buffering to take place there is a necessity for redundancies of gene function, on the other hand such redundancies are clearly unstable in face of natural selection and are therefore unlikely to be found in evolved genomes.\n\nDuplicated genes that diverge in function may undergo subfunctionalization or can become degenerate. When two protein coding genes are degenerate there will be conditions where the gene products appear functionally redundant and also conditions where the gene products take on unique functions. \n\n"}

It was released as the lead single from the band's 13th studio album, \"Around the Sun\" (2004). Although it was not as heavily promoted as earlier singles, it reached as high as number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. However, the song failed to chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the only lead US single from an R.E.M. studio album not to chart on the US Hot 100 besides \"Cant Get There from Here\" from \"Fables of the Reconstruction\" in 1985.\n\nIn early live performances of the song (September 2004), the band would play Michael Stipe's \"\"It's pulling me apart. Change.\"\" album backing vocal during the chorus and bridge of live performances. As early as February 2005, however, as evidenced on the \"R.E.M. Live\" disc, the band worked up an alternative whereby the backing vocals would be shared amongst Mike Mills, Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow in order to make the song flow more smoothly.\n\nAs Stipe stated in interviews, the tune is a love song to the city. Stipe regards New York as his second hometown. Stipe stated that once, flying out of the city and seeing it from above, he was overwhelmed by its beauty and wrote the song right there on the plane.\n\nThe music video was shot with real friends of the band members, throwing a party, and snapshots of Stipe in different places of the city, giving the video a spontaneous and private atmosphere.\n\nAll tracks by Peter Buck, Mike Mills, and Michael Stipe unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1948 it was transformed into the Rural University of Minas Gerais. It was federalized in 1969 with its present name.\n\nThis institution is a prestigious university in Brazil. UFV offers 47 different undergrad courses in many areas, including engineering, agronomy, medicine, veterinary medicine, animal husbandry, and other areas related to science. The university has a highly regarded Graduate School as well, offering 36 Master's degree programs and 24 for at PhD level.\n\nViçosa has had a longstanding relationship with Purdue University (USA) and its College of Agriculture, which continues to this day. In the 1950s and 1960s, numerous members of Purdue's faculty stayed in Brazil for several years to help build and strengthen the program at Viçosa. Those that went include Ellsworth Christmas (former Purdue Professor of Agronomy), Jules Janick (Purdue Professor of Horticulture), Doug Knudson (Purdue Professor of Forestry), and D. Woods Thomas, former Associate Dean and Director of International Programs in Agriculture at Purdue University. \nIn recent years, the university has had multiple exchange programs with universities in several countries, especially Latin America and African countries that speak Portuguese. There have also been exchange agreements with universities in the United States and Canada, through which UFV sends a Brazilian student to the University of Florida or the University of Georgia for each U.S. student sent to the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, for example. There is also an exchange program with the Netherlands \"Living Lab Biobased Brazil\" which is an exchange program between universities of applied science in the Netherlands and multiple universities in Brazil.

{"id": "2228465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228465", "title": "Arno Breker", "text": "Arno Breker\n\nArno Breker (19 July 1900 – 13 February 1991) was a German architect and sculptor who is best known for his public works in Nazi Germany, where they were endorsed by the authorities as the antithesis of degenerate art. One of his better known statues is \"Die Partei\", representing the spirit of the Nazi Party that flanked one side of the carriage entrance to Albert Speer's new Reich Chancellery.\n\nBreker was born in Elberfeld, in the west of Germany, the son of stonemason Arnold Breker. He began to study architecture, along with stone-carving and anatomy. At age 20 he entered the Düsseldorf Academy of Arts where he concentrated on sculpture, studying under Hubert Netzer and Wilhelm Kreis. He first visited Paris in 1924, shortly before finishing his studies. There he met with Jean Cocteau, Jean Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and Alfred Flechtheim. In 1927 he moved to Paris, which he thereafter considered to be his home, in the same year he had an exhibition with Alf Bayrle. Breker was quickly accepted by the art dealer Alfred Flechtheim. He also established close relationships with important figures in the art world, including Charles Despiau, Isamu Noguchi, Maurice de Vlaminck and André Dunoyer de Segonzac, all of whom he later portrayed. He travelled to North Africa, producing lithographs which he published under the title \"Tunisian Journey\". He also visited Aristide Maillol, who was later to describe Breker as \"Germany's Michelangelo\".\n\nIn 1932, he was awarded a prize by the Prussian Ministry of Culture, which allowed him to stay in Rome for a year. In 1934 he returned to Germany on the advice of Max Liebermann. At this time Alfred Rosenberg, editor of the Nazi newspaper \"Völkischer Beobachter\", actually denounced some of Breker's work as degenerate art. However, Breker was supported by many Nazi leaders, especially Adolf Hitler. Even Rosenberg later hailed his sculptures as expressions of the \"mighty momentum and will power” (“Wucht und Willenhaftigkeit”) of Nazi Germany. He took commissions from the Nazis from 1933 through 1942, for example participating in a show of his work in occupied Paris in 1942, where he met Jean Cocteau, who appreciated his work. He maintained personal relationships with Albert Speer and with Hitler. In 1936 he won the commission for two sculptures representing athletic prowess, intended for the 1936 Olympic games, one representing a Decathlete (“Zehnkämpfer”) and the other The Victress (“Die Siegerin”). In 1937 he married Demetra Messala (Δήμητρα Μεσσάλα), a Greek model. The same year, Breker joined the Nazi Party and was made \"official state sculptor\" by Hitler, given a large property and provided a studio with forty-three assistants. Hitler also exempted him from military service. His twin sculptures \"The Party\" and \"The Army\" held a prominent position at the entrance to Albert Speer's new Reich Chancellery.\n\nThe neoclassical nature of his work, with titles like \"Comradeship\", \"Torchbearer\", and \"Sacrifice\", typified Nazi ideals, and suited the characteristics of Nazi architecture. On closer inspection, though, the proportions of his figures, the highly colouristic treatment of his surfaces (the strong contrasts between dark and light accents), and the melodramatic tension of their musculatures perhaps invites comparison with the Italian Mannerist sculptors of the 16th century. This Mannerist tendency to Breker's neoclassicism may suggest closer affinities to concurrent expressionist tendencies in German Modernism than is acknowledged.\n\nUntil the fall of the Third Reich, Breker was a professor of visual arts in Berlin. While nearly all of his sculptures survived World War II, more than 90% of his public work was destroyed by the allies after the war. In 1946, Breker was offered a commission by Joseph Stalin but he refused and stated \"One dictatorship is sufficient for me\". In 1948 Breker was designated as a \"fellow traveller\" of the Nazis and fined, upon which he returned to Düsseldorf. The latter city remained his base, with periods of residence in Paris. During this time he worked as an architect. However, he continued to receive commissions for sculptures, producing a number of works in his familiar classical style, working for businesses and individual patrons. He also produced many portrait sculptures. In 1970 he was commissioned by the king of Morocco to produce work for the United Nations Building in Casablanca, but the work was destroyed. Many other works followed, including portraits of Anwar Sadat and Konrad Adenauer. Breker's rehabilitation continued, culminating in plans for the creation of a Breker museum, funded by the Bodenstein family, who set aside Schloss Nörvenich (between Aachen and Cologne) for the purpose. The Arno Breker Museum was inaugurated in 1985.\n\nBreker's rehabilitation led to backlashes from anti-Nazi activists, including controversy in Paris when some of his works were exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1981. In the same year anti-Breker demonstrations accompanied an exhibition in Berlin. Breker's admirers insisted that he had never been a supporter of Nazi ideology (despite being a member of the Nazi Party), but had simply accepted their patronage.\n\nBreker's last major work was a monumental sculpture of Alexander the Great intended to be located in Greece.\n\nArno Breker was married twice. His first wife, Demetra Messala, was a Greek model. She died in 1956 in a car accident. He remarried in 1958 to Charlotte Kluge. They had two children, Gerhart (1959) and Carola (1962). Breker remained married to Kluge until his death in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Moorcroft travelled extensively throughout the Himalayas, Tibet and Central Asia, eventually reaching Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan.\n\nMoorcroft was born in Ormskirk, Lancashire, the illegitimate son of Ann Moorcroft, daughter of a local farmer. He was baptised in 1767 in St Peter & St Paul, the Parish Church of Ormskirk, where there is a commemorative plaque to his life. His family had sufficient means to secure an apprenticeship with a surgeon in Liverpool but during this time an unknown disease decimated cattle herds in Lancashire and young William was recruited to treat stricken animals. His proficiency so impressed the county landowners they offered to underwrite his education if he would abandon surgery to attend a veterinarian college in Lyon, France. He arrived in France in the revolutionary year of 1789 and became the first Englishman to qualify as a veterinary surgeon. On completing his course he began practice in London, established a \"hospital for horses\" on Oxford Street, helped found the first British veterinary college, proposed new surgical methods for curing lameness in horses, and acquired four patents on machines to manufacture horseshoes. In 1795, Moorcroft published a pamphlet of directions for the medical treatment of horses, with special reference to India, and in 1800 a \"Cursory Account of the Methods of Shoeing Horses\".\n\nIn 1803 a citizen army was mobilised to defend Britain against a threatened Napoleonic invasion. Moorcroft joined the Westminster Volunteer Cavalry. His activities with the volunteers brought him to the attention of Edward Parry, a director of the East India Company (EIC). Parry recruited Moorcroft to manage the Company stud in Bengal. In 1808 \nMoorcroft left the comforts of his home and the security of his thriving practice for Calcutta, India, the seat of British rule.\n\nEverywhere the new Superintendent of Stud looked upon his arrival he found depressing signs of laxness, neglect and ignorance. Often undersized mares were bred with local stallions, the best colts were kept back and stud books falsified. Nevertheless, under his care the stud rapidly improved. He took brisk charge of his staff and weeded out deficient horses. Moorcroft became the first to cultivate oats on a large scale in India and set aside at Pusa for its production.\n\nIn 1811 Moorcroft travelled extensively in the northern sub-continent in search of better breeding stock. Despite travelling to Lucknow, the capital of Oudh, and to Benares, then still part of Maratha territory, Moorcorft failed to acquire the ideal breeding horses that he sought. In Benares he learned that Bukhara was rumoured to have \"the greatest horse market in the world.\" Moorcroft recruited a Persian named Mir Izzat-Allah to make a scouting trip to Bukhara and map out the route. He also learned that fine breeding horses might be found in Tibet.\n\nDisguised as \"gosains\" (Hindu trading pilgrims), Moorcroft and Captain William Hearsey, carrying a stock of merchandise for the purpose of establishing trade relations between India and Central Asia, travelled the upper Ganges through the foothills of the Himalayas. They left Joshimath, well within the mountains, on 26May 1812.\n\nProceeding along the valley of the Dauli, a tributary of the Ganges, they reached the summit of the frontier pass of Niti on 1July. Here they were met by Rawats who were under strict orders from Tibet to repel the foreigners. \nWith his charm, the promise of gain, and proficient use of his medical kit, Moorcroft gained the friendship of two influential Rawats, Deb Singh and his brother Bir Singh. \nThe orders from Tibet were ignored and Amer Singh, the son of Bir Singh, was recruited to serve as a guide through the Niti pass and over the Tibetan plateau. \nArriving at the town of Daba they awaited permission to proceed to Gartok seat of the Garpon, (Governor of western Tibet). \nThe Garpon agreed to sell them \"cashmir\" shawl wool, and granted permission for them to travel to the sacred lake of Manasarowar. \nMoorcroft struck the main upper branch of the Indus near its source, and on 5August arrived at Lake Manasarovar, which they explored extensively. \nReturning via the Sutlej valley, he was detained for some time by the Gorkhas in Nepal, but eventually reached Calcutta in November, only to be chastised severely by the EIC for his failure to find horses—they were not interested in shawl wool or Tibetan lakes.\n\nThe journey to Tibet only served to whet Moorcroft's appetite for more extensive travel. But when he broached the idea of a new horse buying expedition to Bukhara in 1816, a searing reply from the EIC Board of Managers warned Moorcroft to keep \"steady\" at his stud duties and not \"waste his time\" on \"wild and romantick (\"sic\") excursions to the banks of the Amoo (Oxus) and the plains of Chinese Tartary.\" What Moorcroft coveted most were the Turkoman horses, with their pale golden coats, narrow chests, long necks and sturdy legs. The \"good Turcoman horses\" that Marco Polo had described some 500 years earlier could travel a day for weeks on end. Their descendants, the Akhal-Teke, are bred to this day in Turkmenistan and Russia. Moorcroft persisted in his quest and his seven-year campaign was finally rewarded in May 1819 when Charles Metcalfe, head of the EIC's Political and Secret Department, granted him leave to proceed. Metcalfe's goal was to use his friend as an intelligence scout on his epic journey.\n\nMoorcroft's preparations took nearly a year. His roster of recruits included the Persian, Mir Izzat Khan, who had already made the trip alone some years before and an Afghan, Gulam Hyder Khan from his previous expedition to Tibet. Nineteen-year-old George Trebeck, a recent arrival in Calcutta was selected as second in command. The total expedition totalled 300 persons, including an escort of 12 Gurkas, sixteen horses and mules along with £4,000 of trading goods as well as medical supplies and equipment.\n\nLeaving the main caravan at the border of the Punjab on the Sutlej River, Moorcroft travelled separately to Lahore to obtain permission from Maharaja Ranjit Singh to traverse his territory. This was finally granted in mid May 1820. He then met up with Trebeck and the rest of his party at Sultanpur in the Kulu valley in August. From there the caravan trekked up the Beas River, crossed the Rohtang Pass and descended into the Lahul valley and the city of Leh, capital of the Buddhist kingdom of Ladakh. Leh was reached on 24September where several months were spent exploring the surrounding country. A commercial treaty was concluded with the government of Ladakh, by which the whole of Central Asia was virtually opened to British trade in exchange for British protection. Unfortunately, this treaty would have required the Ladakhi's to break relations with Ranjit Singh, the Maharajah of the Sikh Empire. The EIC placed a high value on its alliance with Ranjit Singh so once again Moorcroft had overstepped his authority. His engagement with Ladakh was repudiated and his salary suspended. In all nearly two years were spent in Ladakh, awaiting permission from the Chinese in Yarkand to proceed.\n\nWhile exploring Ladakh he had a chance encounter with another European, Alexander Csoma de Kőrös a penniless Hungarian philologist from Transylvania. \nCsoma was searching for the ancient Asian roots of the Hungarian language in the Tibetan tongue. Moorcroft shared his own Tibetan dictionary with the traveller and although Csoma failed to prove his thesis he is now widely seen as the founder of Tibetology. It was Moorcroft who steered Csoma towards the compilation of the first Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar book for the EIC.\n\nMoorcroft continued his journey, reaching Kashmir on 3November 1822, Jalalabad on 4June 1824, and Kabul on 20 June. He and his companions were the first Europeans to see the Buddhas of Bamiyan and the first Englishmen to see the upper Oxus. They reached Bokhara on 25 February 1825, but found none of the rumored horses and also learned that a Russian mission had reached Bokhara four years before.\n\nReturning, at Andkhoy, in Afghan Turkestan, Moorcroft was seized with fever, of which he died on 27August 1825, with Trebeck surviving him by only a few days. \nHowever, according to the Abbé Huc, Moorcroft reached Lhasa in 1826, and lived there twelve years, being assassinated on his way back to India in 1838, although this story of Moorcroft's \"second life\" has been explained as unlikely.\n\nIn 1841, Moorcroft's papers were obtained by the Asiatic Society, and published under the editorship of H. H. Wilson as \"Travels in the Himalayan Provinces of Hinduslan and the Punjab, in Ladakh and Kashnair, in Peshawur, Kabul, Kunduz and Bokhara, from 1819 to 1825\".\n\n\n"}

He first came to prominence with his 1896 submission for the Völkerschlachtdenkmal in Leipzig, although the commission went to Bruno Schmitz. Around the turn of the century, Kreis designed 58 of the Bismarck Towers, a number of civic projects in Dresden, the 1924 William Marx house, and other significant projects. The 1926 \"Rheinhalle\" (today:Tonhalle Düsseldorf) in Düsseldorf was his first major cultural project, followed by the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden. As opposed to the modernist movement then emerging, Kreis was among those architects like Heinrich Tessenow and Paul Bonatz who continued to work in a historical, conservative style.\n\nKreis was dismissed from the presidency of the League of German Architects (BDA) in 1933 and he saw his commissions dry up as a result. But within two years he was again working, under the direction of Albert Speer, for war projects in Dresden and the gigantic plans for Berlin, notably the design for the massive Soldiers Hall. Employing the respected Kreis brought Speer some legitimacy; Kreis responded by becoming an active supporter of National Socialism. He was named as one of the Reich's most important artists in the Gottbegnadeten list of September 1944. \n\nIn the postwar period, Kreis continued to receive commissions despite his advanced age.\n\nGeorge L.

It is the longest runic inscription in Uppland and the second longest one in Sweden after the Rök Runestone.\n\nThe inscription on the Hillersjö stone, which is 2.8 by 1.0 meters, consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on an intertwined serpent. The main text is written on the serpent with extraneous information, such as the fact that \"Þorbjôrn Skald carved the runes,\" carved outside of the serpent. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks.\n\nThe runic text indicates that Gerlög married with Germund when she was very young, and they had a son who is not named. Germund drowned and the son died. Then Gerlög remarried with Gudrik and they had several children, but only one survived, who was named Inga. Inga married Ragnfast of Snottsta and they had a son who is not named. Both Ragnfast and the son died and so Inga inherited the estate Snottsta. Inga then married Eric, but both soon died without leaving any children. This meant that Gerlög inherited her daughter's property. It has been noted that the chain of inheritance documented on the Hillersjö stone, including how property passed to women through their children, is consistent with the inheritance rules later codified in the 1296 Uppland Law.\n\nThis text is completed with information from runestone U 20/U 21, where it is said that both Gudrik (Gerlög's second husband and Inga's father) and Eric (Inga's second husband) had died.\n\nThe estate Snottsta (also spelled Snåttsta) still exists. At Snottsta and the neighboring Vreta there are several other runestones that complete the saga of Inga that are called the Snottsta and Vreta stones.\n\nThe runic text begins with the imperitive \"Rað þu!\" which is translated as \"Interpret!\" Other runestones with similar imperitive exclamations in their runic texts include U 328 in Stora Lundby and Sö 158 in Österberga. On the Hillersjö stone, \"Rað þu!\" is carved on the eye of the serpent, perhaps indicating that the stone as a record of inheritance was intended for the public.\n\nThe inscription is signed by the runemaster Þorbjôrn Skald, who also signed the runestone U 532 at Roslags-Bro. Other inscriptions have been attributed to him, including several stones signed only with \"Þorbjôrn.\" He was likely selected as the runemaster for his composition of the Hillersjö stone's text in alliterative verse known as \"höjningar\", a traditional style which uses half-lines characterized by two stressed and accented or rising syllables.\n\nThe Stockholm County Museum presents the story of Gerlög and Inga as a dramatic real life family saga which was documented for posterity on this runestone sometime between 1060 and 1100. Local theater associations nearby have conducted plays which recreate the rather dramatic tale of Gerlög.\n\n"}

Along with the Social Party of National Unity, or \"Party of the U\" (the largest party in the lower house and the second-largest in the upper house) and the Conservative Party, it was president Álvaro Uribe's main ally in Congress and formed part of his majority.\n\nThe party is regularly troubled by criminal or corruption cases.\n\nAfter the tenure of president Ernesto Samper (1994-1998), a faction of the Liberal Party was not happy with the new social democratic route the party was moving towards. As such, a more right-wing faction of the party split away and formed Radical Change. However, it did not run for either parliamentary or presidential elections during the 1990s.\n\nIn the 2002 elections, the party won two seats in the Senate and seven in the chamber of representatives. The party joined a coalition with the government of Álvaro Uribe, and voted in favor of the re-electionist project; this involved changing sections of the constitution that prevent a president from running for a second term.\n\n2006 was their best electoral year. They became the 4th largest political group in Congress with 15 senators and 18 representatives. They remained in coalition with the Uribe administration and supported his candidacy for re-election. German Vargas Lleras, then leader of the party and senator, became one of the Senate's most active voices.\n\nThe biggest party in Congress (and Uribe's new U Party) proposed to change the constitution, yet again, to allow the president to run for a third term. The party was divided between those who wanted a second direct re-election for a third term and those who were against it. Vargas Lleras was among those opposed.\n\nAlthough a third term was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, the damage was done and those who still supported Uribe quit the party to run for Congress in the 2010 parliamentary elections with the newly-formed U party.\n\nThe party suffered big blows in 2010, losing votes and members in both chambers: seven Senators and two Representatives. Vargas Lleras then ran as the candidate in the 2010 presidential election, finishing in third place in the first round. The party then joined the first-round winner, Juan Manuel Santos, along with the Liberal Party and the Conservative party to form the \"National Unity Pact\" that would work together for the next four years.\n\nThe party assisted the government with most of their agenda in Congress.\n\nWhen the peace talks with the FARC began, the party offered their approval and criticized then ex-President Álvaro Uribe for opposing dialogue.\n\nIn 2014, the party participated in the parliamentary elections and joined in a coalition with Santos for his reelection. Vargas Lleras was named the vice-presidential candidate. Although the party received fewer votes than in 2010, they added one senator, but lost one seat in the lower chamber. Santos won the second round of the presidential elections that year, making the vice-presidential position the highest the party had ever achieved.\n\n"}

{"id": "2228602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228602", "title": "Maccabiah Games", "text": "Maccabiah Games\n\nThe Maccabiah Games (a.k.a. the World Maccabiah Games; , or משחקי המכביה העולמית; often referred to as the \"Jewish Olympics\"), first held in 1932, are an international Jewish and Israeli multi-sport event now held quadrennially in Israel. It is the third-largest sporting event in the world, with 10,000 athletes competing. The Maccabiah Games were declared a \"Regional Sports Event\" by, and under the auspices and supervision of, the International Olympic Committee in 1961.\n\nThe 2017 Maccabiah Games, also known as the 20th Maccabiah Games, were held in July 2017. They brought together 10,000 athletes, making it the third-largest international sporting event in the world by number of competitors (after the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup). The athletes competed on behalf of 85 countries, in 45 sports.\n\nOriginally, the Maccabiah was held every three years. Since the 4th Maccabiah, the event has been held every four years, in the year following the Olympic Games. Competitions at the Maccabiah are organized into four divisions – Open, Juniors, Masters, and Disabled. The Games are organized by the Maccabi World Union.\n\nThe Maccabiah Games are open to Jewish athletes from around the world, as well as to all Israeli athletes regardless of ethnicity or religion. Arab Israelis have also competed in it.\n\nThe name \"Maccabiah\" was chosen after Judah Maccabee, a Jewish leader who defended his country from King Antiochus. Modi'in, Judah's birthplace, is also the starting location of the torch that's used to light the flames at the opening ceremony, a tradition that started at the 4th Maccabiah.\n\nThe Maccabiah Games were the result of a proposal put forward by Yosef Yekutieli in 1929 at the \"Maccabi World Congress\". Yekutieli, who heard about the Stockholm Olympics, wanted to form a representation for Eretz Yisrael. Following the appointment of the new British Palestine High Commissioner, Sir Arthur Grenfell Wauchope, the Maccabiah got the go-ahead.\n\nThe 1st Maccabiah opened on March 28, 1932. The Maccabiah Stadium in Tel Aviv, which was built with donations, was filled to capacity. Roughly 400 athletes from 18 countries took part in everything from swimming, football, and handball, to various athletics. In the first Games, the Polish delegation took first place.\n\nFollowing the success of the first Games, the 2nd Maccabiah was held from April 2 to 10, 1935, despite official opposition by the British Mandatory government. Over 1,300 athletes from 28 nations participated. The 3rd Maccabiah, which was originally scheduled for spring of 1938, was postponed until 1950 due to British concerns of large-scale illegal immigration, World War II, and the Independence War. It became the first Maccabiah to be held after the establishment of the State of Israel.\nStarting from the 4th Maccabiah, the games were changed to take place every four years in the year following the Olympics. The 15th edition was marred by what became known as the Maccabiah bridge disaster, when a temporary bridge built for the march of athletes at the opening ceremony collapsed, plunging about 100 members of the Australian delegation into the waters of the Yarkon River. Four athletes were killed, and 63 injured. More than 5,000 participants from over 50 countries competed in those Games.\n\nOver the last two decades, the number of participants grew to 9,000 athletes in the 19th Maccabiah, from 78 countries, making it the 3rd-largest sporting event in the world and the largest sporting event in 2013, behind the Pan-Am Games and the Olympics. It is a forum for Jewish athletes to meet and convene, and provides the athletes with opportunities to explore Israel and Jewish history.\n\nPrior to World War II there was an attempt to organize a winter Maccabiah. Due to the relatively warm temperatures in Palestine, the winter Maccabiot were organized in European nations. The 1st Winter Maccabiah was held in Zakopane, Poland, February 2 to 5, 1933. The games were met with great opposition; the \"Gazeta Warszawska\" newspaper encouraged Polish youth to intervene during the games to prevent the \"Jewification of Polish winter sports venues\".\n\nA second attempt at the winter games was relatively more successful. The 2nd Winter Maccabiah took place February 18 to 22, 1936, in Banská Bystrica (then Czechoslovakia). In the games, 2,000 athletes from 12 nations participated. This was the last time a winter Maccabiah was ever held, and the only two Maccabiot to not take place in the Land of Israel; although Maccabi still runs smaller regional winter games to date.\n\nThe Maccabiah ceremonies are two ceremonial events that take place during the first and last days of the Maccabiah games. The ceremonies are an important part of the Jewish culture in Israel and the Zionist movement. The ceremonies of the Maccabiah trace their roots to the early Olympic Games of the 20th century. As such, they share many similarities.\n\nThe Maccabiah opening ceremony, which is organized by the Maccabi World Union, has recently been presented in English, Hebrew, and Spanish.\n\nThe opening ceremonies represent the official commencement of the Maccabiah. Some sports however, such as golf and rugby, might start prior to the opening ceremonies in order to finish on time.\n\nThe opening ceremony for the first Games was held at the new Maccabiah Stadium. The Stadium, which is located next to the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, was finished just the night before. The Stadium also hosted the 2nd Maccabiah in 1935. For the 3rd Maccabiah, the opening ceremony took place in a new stadium in Ramat Gan. The stadium has been hosting the opening ceremonies of the Maccabiah ever since, with the exception of the 16th, 19th, and 20th Maccabiah Games which were held in Teddy Stadium, Jerusalem.\nThe ceremonies often start with the introduction of the active participants of the Maccabi youth movement. After the parade of nations, the opening ceremony continues on with a presentation of artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theater representative of the Jewish culture. In recent games, Jewish singers from around the world participated in the opening ceremony. For example, in 2013, Grammy Award-winner Miri Ben-Ari and \"X Factor\" USA finalist Carly Rose Sonenclar performed at the opening ceremony.\n\nJust like at the Olympics, the Maccabiah starts out with a \"Parade of Nations\", during which most participating athletes march into the stadium, country by country. The countries enter the stadium in accordance with the Hebrew alphabet. The parade of nations, in contrast to some other games, include junior and disabled athletes who also partake in the competitions. In accordance with the Maccabiah's tradition, the Israeli delegation always enters last.\n\nThe closing ceremony of the Maccabiah Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Typically, a member of Maccabi or some other well-known figure makes the closing speech and the Games officially close. The ceremony includes large artistic displays of music, singing, and dance. Various Jewish singers perform during the closing ceremony. In recent years, the closing ceremonies included popular musicians and live music and dancing.\n\nA medal ceremony is held after each Maccabiah event is concluded. The winner, second, and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. Medals are awarded by an official Maccabi member.\n\nThe Maccabiah Games recognize all 28 current Olympic sports, plus a number of other sports such as chess, cricket, and netball. In contrast with the Olympic Games and other major international sporting events, the Maccabiah rules regarding accepting new sports are very lenient. New sports are accepted to the Maccabiah Games provided that competitions will only take place if at least four delegations bring competitors for that sport (three in the case of female sports, as well as the junior divisions). As a result, the Maccabiah has held various unique competitions such as duplicate bridge.\n\nKarate, not yet on the Olympic schedule, made its debut in 1977 at the 10th Maccabiah Games. The requisite number of initial countries signed on and agreed to send delegations. Since 1977, karate has participated uninterrupted. Although at the beginning karate was only contested in the fighting or kumite category, forms or kata was included in 1981. In 1985, women's karate was added. Junior and youth categories made their debut in 2009. The World Karate Federation, a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), oversees and supervises the rules of karate competition at the Maccabiah.\n\nThe Maccabiah Games are organized into four divisions: Open, Junior, Masters, and Paralympics.\n\n\nIn recent Maccabiot there has been a renewed interest in introducing new sports to the Maccabiah. In the 15th Maccabiah Games, ice hockey was first introduced. Ice hockey was not included in immediately subsequent games, but returned in the 19th Maccabiah. Squash became an official sport in the 10th Maccabiah Games in 1977. The 19th Maccabiah was also granted provisional approval for dressage and jumping competitions from the FEI.\n\nAthletes who have competed in the Maccabiah Games include many Olympic gold medalists, world champions, and world record holders. Among them have been Mark Spitz, Lenny Krayzelburg, Jason Lezak, Marilyn Ramenofsky, and Anthony Ervin (swimming); Mitch Gaylord, Abie Grossfeld, Ágnes Keleti, Valery Belenky, and Kerri Strug (gymnastics); Ernie Grunfeld, Danny Schayes, (coaches); Larry Brown, Nat Holman, and Dolph Schayes (basketball); Carina Benninga (field hockey); Lillian Copeland, Gerry Ashworth, and Gary Gubner (track and field); Angela Buxton, Brad Gilbert, Julie Heldman, Allen Fox, Nicolás Massú, and Dick Savitt (tennis); Dave Blackburn (softball); Angelica Rozeanu (table tennis); Sergey Sharikov, Vadim Gutzeit, and Mariya Mazina (fencing); Isaac Berger and Frank Spellman (weightlifting); and Lindsey Durlacher, Jason Goldman, Fred Oberlander and Henry Wittenberg (wrestling); Madison Gordon-Lavaee (volleyball); Donald Spero and Michael Oren (rowing); Bruce Fleisher (golf); and Adam Bacher, Dennis Gamsy, Neil Rosendorff, Marshall Rosen, Bob Herman (cricket); Boris Gelfand and Judit Polgár (chess); Elizabeth Foody (interpretive dance); Adam Rubin (soccer); Aaron R. Schwid (bowling); Jessica Schulman (soccer); Irwin Cotler (ping pong); Marcelo Lipatin, Jeff Agoos, and Jonathan Bornstein (association football), and Steve March Tormé (fast-pitch softball); Shawn Lipman (rugby), Dov Sternberg and Ilyse Sternberg (Karate); and Ori Sasson (judo).\n\nThe Maccabiah Games have grown into one of the world's largest sporting events, with 85 participating countries in the current edition of the Maccabiah. Below is a list of countries that participated in the most recent games in 2017. Scroll down for participating nations from the 2014 edition and other games\n\n\nEarly games featured many delegations from the Arab nations. Iran, a Muslim, but not Arab country, which debuted at the 7th Maccabiah, stopped participating following the Iranian Revolution. Some of these countries have participated under multiple flags. Countries that previously participated but did not in the most recent Maccabiah are:\n\n\n"}

The anchors are Macy's, Macy's Men's & Home, JCPenney, and Nordstrom with one vacant anchor last occupied by Sears that has yet to be redeveloped into Life Time Fitness, retail, entertainment, and apartments.\n\nThe mall opened in 1977. Originally, the mall was anchored by Sears and May Company California. Later, The Broadway was added, and Nordstrom opened their second California store. J. W. Robinson's and a larger Nordstrom were then constructed along with a Y-shaped addition to the main mall in the early 1990s. In 1993, The May Department Stores Company merged J. W. Robinson's and May Company California to form Robinsons-May. As a result, the J. W. Robinson's store was sold to JCPenney, and the May Company California location was renamed and expanded. The Broadway was converted to Macy's after Federated Department Stores, Inc.'s purchase of The Broadway's parent company Carter Hawley Hale Stores in 1996. In 2006, due to the merger between Federated Department Stores and The May Department Stores Company, the Robinsons-May location was converted to a Macy's furniture store. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Brea Mall also had an ice skating rink that was later removed to expand the food court.\n\nThe Brea Mall has also been host to recording artists such as Ashlee Simpson, Mýa, Ryan Cabrera, and The Summer Obsession.\n\nOn January 4, 2018, Sears announced that its Brea store would be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide. The store closed on April 8, 2018, making it the last original anchor store to close.

{"id": "2228629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228629", "title": "Argentine literature", "text": "Argentine literature\n\nArgentine literature, i.e. the set of literary works produced by writers who originated from Argentina, is one of the most prolific, relevant and influential in the whole Spanish speaking world, with renowned writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar, Leopoldo Lugones and Ernesto Sábato.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the name of the country itself comes from a Latinism which first appeared in a literary source: Martin del Barco Centenera's epic poem \"La Argentina\" (1602). This composition runs 10.000 verses and describes the landscape as well as the conquest of the territory. The word was reintroduced in \"Argentina manuscrita\", a prose chronicle by Ruy Díaz de Guzmán.\n\nArgentine literature began around 1550 with the work of Matías Rojas de Oquendo and Pedro González de Prado (from Santiago del Estero, the first important urban settlement in Argentina), who wrote prose and poetry. They were partly inspired by oral aboriginal poetry—in particular, according to Carlos Abregú Virreyra, by the \"lules\", \"juríes\", \"diaguitas\" and \"tonocotés\". A symbiosis emerged between the aboriginal and Spanish traditions, creating a distinct literature, geographically limited (well into the 18th century) to the Argentine north and central regions, with the province of Córdoba as its center, due to the foundation of the National University of Córdoba. Two names stand out from this period: Gaspar Juárez Baviano, and Antonia de la Paz y Figueroa, also known as \"Beata Antula\".\n\nGradually, with the economic prosperity of the port, the cultural axis moved eastward. The letters of the colonial age (Viceroyalty-neoclassicism, baroque and epic) grew under the protection of the independentist fervor: Vicente López y Planes, Pantaleón Rivarola and Esteban de Luca.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Argentine baroque literature was poor in comparison with that from Europe and some other parts of the New World. The only remarkable poet of this period was fray José Luis de Tejeda who wrote \"Coronas líricas\" and \"El peregrino de Babilonia\"\n\nAs in the rest of the continent, strong feelings of emancipation from Spain were present in Argentina. Before independence, some neoclassical authors such as Juan Cruz Varela produced numerous works related with this revolutionary spirit but still under the paradoxical Spanish domain.\n\nArgentina's true break with Spanish tradition was manifested in literature through the adoption of French romanticism as a model, postulating the return to popular sources and to the medieval. This aesthetic and intellectual was brought by Esteban Echeverría who wrote the first local and realistic story, \"El Matadero\" (\"The slaughterhouse\"), as well as the nativist poem \"La Cautiva\" (\"The Captive\"), with the Pampas as its background. His barbed wit and opposition to powerful Buenos Aires governor Juan Manuel de Rosas forced him into exile.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century José Mármol published the first Argentine novel, \"Amalia\" (1851–1852), a historical novel set during the dark year of 1840 which mixed fictional characters (Amalia, Daniel Bello, Eduardo Belgrano) with actual historical characters like Juan Manuel de Rosas.\n\nAs Rosas' power increased, more literary works from the opposition were produced, such as Juan Bautista Alberdi's play \"El Gigante Amapolas\", a good example of local sainete. In the genre of essay, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento published his \"Facundo\", a particular (re)vision of Facundo Quiroga's life from a deterministic point of view. Sarmiento conveyed aspects of sociology and semiotics in this analysis.\n\nEcheverría, Mármol and Sarmiento are among the group of writers known as Generación del 37, who are considered the first generation of local intellectuals.\n\nPoetry lessened in combative spirit and turned towards the anecdotal and sentimental: Carlos Guido y Spano and Ricardo Gutiérrez, the chronicle writers of folk literature. Lucio V. Mansilla published in 1870 \"Una excursión a los indios ranqueles\", a sort of chronicle of a voluntary expedition to sign a peace treaty with the Indians. His work (enrolled in a realistic aesthetic) anticipated Generación del '80, which would be deeply influenced by modernism. Juana Manuela Gorriti was one of the first popular female writers, mainly due to her melodramatic narrative works like the novel \"La hija del mazorquero\" and the foundation of \"La alborada\", a cultural magazine.\n\nEuropean-oriented, indeed Euro-centric, themes and styles would remain the norm in Argentine letters, especially from Buenos Aires, during this century. The (romantic) poetry as \"La cautiva\" or the latter \"Santos Vega\" by Rafael Obligado gave a lot of importance to the nature of the \"pampa\", sharing some elements with a picturesque, imitation-gaucho literature, purporting to use the language of the gauchos and to reflect their mentality. The first current is known as \"poesía nativista\" (nativist poetry) and became a literary tradition. The second (known as \"poesía gauchesca\") developed in parallel as a part of that generation's understanding of national identity. Although it also is a product of literary authors, this writing takes the voice of the gaucho as protagonist from the beginning. \"Gauchesca\" is related to \"payador's singing\", a payador being a modern equivalent of the illiterate medieval singers. A payador's work, in opposition to \"gauchesca\", is sung spontaneously.\n\nThe first \"gauchesco\" author was Bartolomé Hidalgo who wrote during the war of independence and therefore his works had a strong political ideology. His compositions were mainly \"cielitos\" (\"payadoresque\" songs but with provocative political messages) and \"diálogos patrióticos\" (conversations between two characters about current affairs).\n\nIn a second period, \"gauchesca\" was influenced by political-faction fights. Estanislao del Campo, and Hilario Ascasubi are the most representative writers of this period. Del Campo wrote \"Fausto\", a poem which has been read both as a parody of gauchesca and an intelligent joke towards city people. In the poem, Anastasio El Pollo meets a friend and tells him his impressions on particular event: he has seen the Devil. What El Pollo doesn't know (or pretends he doesn't) is that all he saw was actually an opera performance at Teatro Colón.\n\nThe last author of gauchesca is José Hernández, the author of Martín Fierro. Gauchesca leaves its political influences and becomes social in the sense that gauchos are disappearing, mainly due to Sarmiento and the new economic model. Hernández is considered the responsible for consolidating the gauchesco style.\n\nThe generation of 1880 emphasized the European color and cultural supremacy of Buenos Aires. The migratory current of mixed ethnicity accentuated the change of the \"big village\" for the \"cosmopolitan metropolis\". The poetry of this period is lyric: Leopoldo Díaz y Almafuerte. The latter usually depicts the worker's life in passionate attacks against the contradictions of contemporary society. Almafuerte (pseudonym of Pedro Bonifacio Palacios) was also a teacher and a journalist whose opinions and articles gave him a lot of problems.\n\nEssay is a recent genre that developed in the late 19th century: José Manuel Estrada, Pedro Goyena and Joaquín V. González.\n\nNarrative works oscillated between social issues and folk literature. The predominant tendency was Realism, best represented by Miguel Cané in his autobiographical novel \"Juvenilia\". Other writers influenced by realism were Lucio V. Mansilla, Francisco Sicardi, Benito Lynch and Carlos María Ocantos. Naturalism was also an important tendency towards the end of the century. Argentine Naturalism was commanded by Eugenio Cambaceres in his novels \"Sin rumbo\" and \"Música sentimental\", almost forgotten today. Cambaceres was inspired by Émile Zola's theory about the naturalistic approach to literary work, but its ideology suffered considerable alterations. Julián Martel and Antonio Argerich with added a highly loaded moral touch to Argentine naturalism.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, led by the Nicaraguan Rubén Darío, modernism appears in Latin American literature. Preciosity of manner and a strong influence from Symbolism sum up the new genre, which inspires the clearest voice in poetry, Leopoldo Lugones, who was the author of the first Argentine science fiction story. The first truly modern generation in Argentine literature is the Martinfierristas (c. 1922). The movement contributes an intellectual doctrine in which a number of current trends come together: the trend represented by the Florida group, adscript to ultraísmo, with Oliverio Girondo, Jorge Luis Borges, Leopoldo Marechal and Macedonio Fernández; and the trend of Boedo, impressed by Russian realism, with Raúl González Tuñón, César Tiempo y Elías Catelnuovo. Ricardo Güiraldes, however, remains classical in style, giving a whole new freshness to \"gauchesca\" poetry and writing what is perhaps the novel, \"Don Segundo Sombra\".\n\nBenito Lynch (1885–1951), an eccentric short-story writer who, like Güiraldes, does not easily fit into any \"generation\", wrote his quirky tales in an enchanted neo-\"gauchoesque\" manner about this time.\nBetween the end of this decade and the beginning of the following one emerged the \"Novísimos\" (\"Newest\"), a generation of poets (Arturo Cambours Ocampo, Carlos Carlino and José Portogalo), fiction writers (Arturo Cerretani, Roberto Arlt, Luis Maria Albamonte and Luis Horacio Velázquez) and playwrights (Roberto Valenti, Juan Oscar Ponferrada and Javier Villafañe). The group promoted philosophical reflection and a new essence for \"Argentinidad\". Leopoldo Marechal's novel Adán Buenosayres, published in 1948 and praised by Julio Cortázar in 1949.\n\nAlso worthy of note is the literary work of Leonardo Castellani (1899–1981), a Jesuit priest who left a considerable bulk of essays, novels, tales and poetry. Expelled from the Company of Jesus, the outspoken Castellani was also widely ignored – like his contemporary Marechal – by the literary \"intelligentsia\" of his time due to his nationalist ideology.\n\nThe \"Generation of 1937\" centers on poetry, where it developed the descriptive, nostalgic and meditative in the work of Ricardo E. Molinari, Vicente Barbieri, Olga Orozco, León Benarós and Alfonso Sola Gonzáles. Fiction writers subscribed to idealism and magic realism, María Granata, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Julio Cortázar, Silvina Ocampo) or to a subtler form of realism Manuel Mujica Laínez, Ernesto L. Castro, Ernesto Sabato and Abelardo Arias) with some urban touches, as well as folk literature (Joaquín Gómez Bas and Roger Plá).\n\nEssayists do not abound. Antonio Pagés Larraya, Emilio Carilla, Luis Soler Cañas are some of the few who stand out, although the greatest Argentine essayist after Sarmiento – Ezequiel Martínez Estrada – also belonged to the Generation of '37. Many of these writers and a number of European ones contributed extensively to \"Sur\", a literary journal published by Victoria Ocampo, a noted commentator on the day's culture.\n\nIn 1950, another milestone arose: the New Humanism, a response to World War II and its aftermath. On one level are avant-gardists like Raúl Gustavo Aguirre, Edgar Bayley and Julio Llinás; on another, existentialists: José Isaacson, Julio Arístides and Miguel Ángel Viola. Further away are those who reconcile both tendencies with a regionalist tendency: Alfredo Veiravé, Jaime Dávalos and Alejandro Nicotra. Other fiction writers left a highly charged testimony of the times: Beatriz Guido, David Viñas, Marco Denevi and Silvina Bullrich. In a majority of the writers, a strong influence of Anglo-Saxon and Italian poetry can be perceived. Of particular interest are the poetic works of two of Marechal's disciples, the poets Rafael Squirru and Fernando Demaría.\n\nA new trend started in 1960, continuing until about 1990. Its influences are heterogeneous: Sartre, Camus, Eluard; some Spanish writers, like Camilo José Cela; and previous Argentine writers like Borges, Arlt, Cortázar and Marechal. Two trends were in evidence: the tracing of metaphysical time and historicity (Horacio Salas, Alejandra Pizarnik, Ramón Plaza) and the examination of urban and social disarray: (Abelardo Castillo, Marta Lynch, Manuel Puig, Alicia Steinberg).\n\nThe 1970s were a dark period for intellectual creation in Argentina. The epoch is characterised by the exile (Juan Gelman, Antonio Di Benedetto) or death (Roberto Santoro, Haroldo Conti, and Rodolfo Walsh) of major writers. The remaining literary journalists, like Liliana Heker, veiled their opinions in their work. Some journalists (Rodolfo Walsh), poets (Agustín Tavitián and Antonio Aliberti), fiction writers (Osvaldo Soriano, Fernando Sorrentino), and essayists (Ricardo Herrera, María Rosa Lojo) stood out among the vicissitudes and renewed the field of ethical and aesthetic ideas.\n\nThe 1990s are marked by reunion among survivors of different generations, in an intellectual coalition for the review of values and texts as Argentina faced the end of the century. Some examples are Alan Pauls, Mario Areca, Aníbal Cristobo, Ernesto de Sanctis, Marco Denevi, Edgar Brau and some more.\n\n\n\n"}

The Irish Department of Public Expenditure and Reform defines the Irish public service as consisting of:\n\n\nTwo-thirds of the public service is in the health and education sectors (doctors, nurses, consultants, teachers, classroom assistants, etc).\n\nThe Civil Service of Ireland is the collective term for the permanent staff of the departments of state and certain state agencies who advise and work for the Government of Ireland. It consists of two broad components, the Civil Service of the Government and the Civil Service of the State. Whilst these two components are largely theoretical they do have some fundamental operational differences. \n\nThe Civil Service of the Government advises and carries out the work of the Government, through the various Departments of State, of which there are fifteen; one for each Minister of the Government. Each department is led by a senior civil servant known as the Secretary General (often referred to as \"departmental head\" in the media), a title equivalent to that of Permanent Secretary in the British Civil Service. The most senior civil servant and head of the civil service is the Secretary General to the Government, currently Martin Fraser. The Secretary General to the Government is a dual-hatted position as they also head up the Department of the Taoiseach, a government department analogous to a cabinet office in other countries.\n\nThe Civil Service of the State however is a relatively small component of the overall civil service, and its members are expected to be absolutely independent of the government, in addition to normal political independence which is expected. The Civil Service of the State typically comprises specialised agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, Central Statistics Office, Office of Public Works, Comptroller and Auditor-General of Ireland, Courts Service of Ireland, Director of Public Prosecutions, Legal Aid Board and Prisons Service are all considered to be part of the Civil Service of the State, as opposed to being non-commercial semi-state bodies like Fáilte Ireland and IDA Ireland. Other offices are also prescribed under the Civil Service of the State.\n\nThe largest reform of the civil service occurred in 1984 when the abolition of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs led to the halving of civil service numbers. The affected personnel, mainly postal and telecommunications workers, were transferred to An Post and Telecom Éireann respectively. Today there are approximately 37,523 people employed in the national civil service. \n\nThe defence sector refers to the total number of personnel of the Irish Defence Forces, which consists of the Irish Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. Personnel numbers for each of the three services is as follows: \n\n\nState spending on defence totalled €895 million for 2016. \n\nThe education sector represents the second largest sector of the Irish public service, with 96,432 employees working in primary, post-primary and third level institutes. A break-down of numbers is as follows:\n\n\nPublic spending in 2016 on education totalled just over €8.3 billion. \n\nThe health sector in Ireland makes up the largest part of the Irish public service, with a total staff of 105,885. Health makes up 35% of the total number of workers in the national public service. The Health Service Executive is the largest component of Ireland's health sector, with 67,145 employed as part of it. \n\n\nSpending in the health sector totalled just over €13.6 billion in 2016. \n\nThe justice sector refers to policing in Ireland, specifically the Garda Síochána, which has a workforce, not counting civilian staff of 13,261. Spending on policing amounted to €1.4 billion in 2016. \n\nLocal government in Ireland is undertaken by 31 local authorities, each one corresponding to a city or county. Employees of local authorities are considered to be part of the Irish public service, with funding for local government provided mainly by central government, as well the local property tax. There are approximately 27,188 employed for the 31 local authorities across Ireland, with Dublin City Council with the largest employee count of all the councils with 5,330 staff. \n\nNon-commercial state agencies, or government agencies are autonomously run state agencies assigned with a specific task, and typically free to carry out their responsibilities free of government or ministerial interference. State agencies are, for the most part, established through legislation by the Dail and overseen by the relevant committee of the Oireachtas. Examples of such state agencies include the Arts Council, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Health Information and Quality Authority, Higher Education Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland\n\nIn 2016 there were 12,616 employed in various Non-commercial state agencies, with the largest by employee being the Child and Family Agency with 3,554 staff. \n\n\n"}

The team is currently a member of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association.\n\nManual students first organized a football team in 1892. The team won the Kentucky State Championship six times; in 1925, 1936, 1938, 1948, 1959, and 1966. The 1925 and 1938 teams claimed National Champions status due to their undefeated records and defeats of other top national teams, but the 1925 claim is considered a mythical national championship because there was no tournament. The National Sports News Service gave the 1938 High School Football National Championship to Manual. That year, Manual defeated New Britain, Connecticut in a national championship game in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The game was sponsored by the Louisiana Sports Association, which was affiliated with the Sugar Bowl.\n\nManual's rivalry with the Male Bulldogs, dubbed \"The Old Rivalry,\" dates directly to 1893 and is the oldest high school rivalry in Kentucky. The most recent winning team holds a trophy referred to as \"The Barrel.\" The rivalry was fueled in its early years by class differences between college-bound Male students and \"blue collar\" Manual students. The \"Louisville Post\" wrote in 1897 that \"[Male's school colors] have always waved triumphant over the Red of the 'blacksmiths' as their more cultured opponents are wont to dub them\". The game, traditionally played on Thanksgiving Day, was hotly contested and widely attended, with 10,000 spectators attending as early as 1909. The rivalry paused when the schools (and football teams) were consolidated from 1915 to 1918 but was renewed in 1919 after Manual reformed and built its own stadium. Attendance averaged 14,000 from the 1920s through 1957, when crowds were so large that the schools began holding the game at Cardinal Stadium, with a capacity of over 20,000. The record attendance was 22,000 in 1966. Due to changes in the state athletics schedules the Thanksgiving Day game tradition ended in 1980 amid protests from fans, and the game was moved to late October.\n\n"}

It refers to residential buildings erected by a municipality, usually to provide public housing.\n\nApartments in the building can be rented from the respective municipality.\n\n\"Gemeindebauten\" have become an important part of the architecture and culture of Vienna since the 1920s. Up to 1918, the housing conditions of Vienna's growing working class were appalling by modern standards. City investigators routinely discovered unsanitary living conditions during inspections, with issues of overcrowding, excessive moisture, and a complete lack of light and air being among the most frequently cited problems. By 1877, the municipal health authority of the city (the \"Stadtfysikat\") reported 1,113 instances of unfit dwellings, over two-thirds of which were cited for excess moisture. Overcrowding was also a perennial issue, and one case documented in the municipal health report of 1871 found that\n\nWhen the Social Democratic Party of Austria gained control of the municipal administration during Austria's First Republic (1918-1934) (so called \"Red Vienna\"), it began the project of improving living conditions for workers. A large number of Gemeindebauten, usually large residential estates, were built during that time. Including those buildings that were finished after the events of February 1934, 64,000 apartments where completed, which created housing space for about 220,000 people. Apartments were assigned on the basis of a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens.\n\nThe classic interwar Gemeindebauten typically have a main entrance with a large gate, through which one enters into a yard. Inside, there are trees and some greenery, where children can play without having to go out on the street. Apartments are accessed from the inside.\n\nThis fortress-like structure made the buildings adaptable to military use. Several Gemeindebauten in Vienna, most notably the Karl-Marx-Hof, were sites of fighting during the Austrian Civil War of February 1934, when they were defended as Social Democratic Party strongholds.\n\n\"Gemeindebauten\" continued to be built after 1945, but the style of architecture changed over the decades. During the 1960s and 1970s, the municipality began to build extensive residential blocks consisting of high-rise buildings such as Großfeldsiedlung.\n\n\"Gemeindebauten\" in Vienna can be recognized by the following text (or similar) which can usually be found in large red letters above the main entrance:\n\n\"Wohnhausanlage der Gemeinde Wien errichtet in den Jahren 1925 bis 1927 aus den Mitteln der Wohnbausteuer\"\n<br>(Residential estate of the Municipality of Vienna built from 1925 to 1927 financed from the revenues of the Residential Construction Tax).\n\nLarger \"Gemeindebauten\" are identified by their name. The names sometimes derive from the building's geographic location, but usually they are named after a person, sometimes after a famous freedom fighter (e.g., George Washington), but much more often after a famous socialist (e.g., Olof Palme) or a Viennese Social Democratic Party functionary.\n\nToday, about 600,000 people (not necessarily poor ones), about a third of the population of Vienna, live in apartments owned by the city. As the Social Democratic Party has been firmly in control of the municipal administration since World War II, opposition politicians sometimes claim that party members are more likely to be assigned an apartment.\n\nThe most famous \"Gemeindebau\" in Vienna is the Karl-Marx-Hof, built between 1927-33. Other notable buildings are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2228717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228717", "title": "Wormshill", "text": "Wormshill\n\nWormshill ( ), historically Wormsell, is a small village and civil parish within the Borough of Maidstone, Kent, England. The parish is approximately south of the Swale and east of Maidstone. The village of Frinsted lies to the east and Bicknor to the north-west; while Hollingbourne is to the south-west. The village lies on an exposed high point of the North Downs, within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\n\nArchaeological and toponymic evidence of Wormshill's existence predates its appearance in the Domesday survey of 1086. The village contains a number of heritage-listed buildings, which include a Norman church, a public house and one of the oldest surviving post office buildings in the United Kingdom. The fields and woodland surrounding Wormshill have changed little in the past 500 years, and the village itself remains rural with a low population density compared to the national average. The population of 200 is a mixture of agricultural workers employed by local farms and professional residents who commute to nearby towns.\n\nWormshill was listed under the name \"Godeselle\" in the Domesday Book of 1086. The village is thought to be much older, its name deriving from the Anglo-Saxon god Wōden (a cognate with the Norse god, Odin) and meaning \"Woden's Hill\". The area was also described in a paper in \"Archaeologia Cantiana\", 1961, as \"Wormshill, an ancient possession of the Kings of Kent, the hill where they worshipped the heathen Woden\". The University of Nottingham's Institute for Name-Studies has offered the suggestion that the name means \"shelter for a herd of pigs\".\n\nThe Latinised form, \"Wornesell\", appears in the Kent Hundred Rolls of 1274–75 and in a mediaeval will recorded in September 1409. A corruption of the name, \"Wormsell\", is mentioned as the birthplace of a Cistercian Abbot at the nearby Boxley Abbey in 1474; a further variant, \"Wormysell\", is found in a will of 1487, and court papers concerning a land dispute in 1534 use the name \"Wormeshell\".\n\nA 1994 landscape survey identified woodland to the north of the village as having contained ancient flint tools and what appeared to be flint boundary markers, the latter apparently gathered from loose-lying surface flints. The area around the village features ancient deneholes, or agricultural chalk mines, some of which are pre-Roman. These holes, which may be up to deep, were often dug at the edges of fields, onto which the chalk marl would be spread. A Lower Palaeolithic (Acheulian) hand axe was unearthed in the garden of \"Blacksmiths cottage\" in the village. In 1966, the remains of a U-shaped mediaeval pastoral enclosure for controlling the\nmovement of stock were recorded in woodland to the north of the village. The extensive woodland in the parish also meant that it was one of several sources of wooden planking for the piers of Rochester Bridge ( away) from the early 11th century (and theoretically was still liable to do so until the passing of the Rochester Bridge Act in 1908).\n\nThe parish of Wormshill was originally appended to the village and parish of Boughton Malherbe, since both had the same patron; the patron of a parish was the land-owner who often built the church on the estate and who had the right (known as advowson) to appoint the parish priest. The first recorded patron of Wormshill was Robert de Gatton, who owned the Manor of Wormsell during the reign of Henry III (1207–72). From the Gatton family, the village passed by marriage in the 13th century to Sir Simon de Northwood, whose coat of arms appears in the stained glass of St Giles, the village's only church, and whose name (\"Norwood\") is given to the farm at the north of the village.\n\nPatronage of the parish subsequently transferred through a number of landholding families, vesting by the 17th century with the prominent Kent family of Sir Charles Sedley, which at times held the barony of Aylesford. During this period the Tylden (or Tilden) family, believed to have had links to the Crusades of Richard I, were also significant landholders in the area in the early 17th century; a memorial to William Tylden, who died in 1613, rests in the north chancel of St Giles church. Around the same time in the late 16th century, recruits of Sir Francis Drake's navy may have used a track, now known as \"Drake Lane\", in the south west of the parish or camped nearby as they marched from the Weald of Kent to the dockyards at Sheerness.\n\nPatronage is believed to have lapsed from the Sedley family to the Archbishop of Canterbury and then to Sir Joseph Aylosse before being conveyed by gift from a Mr. Serjeant Moses to the charity of the president and governors of Christ's Hospital in London in gratitude for a University of Cambridge scholarship he had received. As late as 1798 the parish was still paying its traditional castle-guard rent to Dover Castle and retained a court baron; this fee was a substitute for a feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle.\n\nLittle (if any) information exists about the village's population or demographics before 1801; however evidence from the first census indicates that the village grew steadily, reaching a peak in 1871. A possible indication of the growth in the agricultural output of the village is the construction of two windmills (possibly used for the production of oil from linseed or rapeseed) marked at \"Beddington\" (present-day Bedmonton) on Ordnance Survey drawings dated 1797 and an Ordnance Survey map published between 1819 and 1843. The mills stood north and south of each other and were approximately to the north-west of the church. House building continued during the mid-to-late 19th century, together with a post office and school. Like much of rural Kent during the time of the Swing Riots (1830), Wormshill experienced a degree of civil unrest and Home Office records indicate that \"a large body of men, numbering 50-100\" assembled at Wormshill with the purpose of \"intimidation and to enforce demands on farmers ... inducing other labourers to join them\".\n\nRecords indicate that at least one former resident of the village fought as part of the Australian contingent in the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. Private Frederick George Kite, born at Wormshill on 16 February 1894, and educated at Wormshill and Milstead, enlisted on 8 September 1915. Originally employed as a fireman, after training at Blackboy and Broadmeadows camps in Victoria, he sailed from Melbourne as part of the Australian Imperial Force, 16th Infantry Battalion aboard HMAT Ceramic A40 on 23 December 1914. He participated in the landing at Gallipoli and was wounded in the left arm and shoulder, ending his active service.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Wormshill joined a number of similar settlements in the region to form part of the anti-invasion network. On the outskirts of the village, near the hamlet of Ringlestone, there are the remains of a \"zero station\" (or \"Operational Base\"), a secret underground communications relay post operated by Auxiliary Units of the British Home Guard. In the event of a German invasion the zero station was to be used by defending forces to receive and transmit coded messages between a series of similar stations in the area as well as to the operational command headquarters at Hannington Hall in Wiltshire. A concealed underground concrete bunker, it was designed to be invisible from the surface and is located in woodland about from the road. Although its primary purpose was a communications post, the zero station was also designed to hold ammunition and explosives and provide living quarters for the radio equipment operators. Anecdotal evidence also indicates that anti-aircraft guns were sited near the village and that a Bren gun emplacement was installed in the valley between Wormshill and Frinsted. A Diver Battery was located to the south west of the village. Forming part of the Kentish Gun Belt, designed to provide a defence to attacks by V-1 flying bombs or \"doodlebugs\", it was armed with eight mobile 3.7-inch guns, and manned by 424 Battery of 138 Regiment of the 40th Anti Aircraft Brigade. It was initially equipped with Predictor AA No.10 and No.3 Mark V radar, and was manned by 57 Brigade in July 1944. There are records of a V-1 being shot down by a Supermarine Spitfire to the west of the village. Flt Lt A. R. Cruikshank is reported as having \"Sited a Diver north of Ashford and attacked from astern at 100 yards range. Saw strikes and Diver fell and exploded in a field\". Villagers resident during the war also recall a V-1 being shot down in orchards near \"Norwood Farm\" and a fighter aircraft crashing in fields to the south of \"Yew Tree Farm\". Roadside checkpoints were set up on the main routes into the village to the north and south and allied forces moving through the region camped overnight in the area, including a detachment of New Zealand troops in fields near \"Home Farm\".\n\nFollowing an initial decline in the population at the turn of the 20th century, more houses were constructed between the Great War and the Second World War and again in the 1950s and 1960s, adding to the cluster of cottages from the 19th century and earlier.\n\nAt the time of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a regional sub-division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within the lathe of Aylesford, the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary for the purposes of the law courts' Quarter Sessions. According to Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): \"northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, is in that of West Kent\". This differs from the traditional distinction between \"Men of Kent\" and \"Kentish Men\", which are separated by the River Medway, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be \"Men of Kent\".\n\nSince 1975, Wormshill has been administered within the North Downs ward and, together with surrounding communities, elects a representative councillor for the ward in the Borough of Maidstone. The incumbent councillor for the North Downs ward is Patrik Garten. The village forms the central focus of the civil and church parishes of Wormshill. The parish chairman is Simon Bass. Wormshill is part of the parliamentary constituency of Faversham and Mid Kent, whose Member of Parliament is Helen Whately of the Conservative Party. It is also in the South East England constituency in the European Parliament.\n\nAt , the village is in central Kent, approximately south-east of London. The nearest town is Sittingbourne, to the north. Wormshill is surrounded by villages and hamlets of a similar size, including Frinsted, Bicknor, Bedmonton and Hucking.\n\nThe village is on a high point of the North Downs. The nearby road intersection of \"Black Post\" is recorded on the Ordnance Survey maps at above sea level. The landscape is primarily characterised by undulating calcareous grassland and ancient deciduous woodland over chalk downland. The settlement itself (as opposed to the wider parish) is on a downland ridge between two shallow dip slope valleys that separate it from Bicknor to the north-west and Frinsted to the east.\nWormshill's elevated and exposed position on the North Downs means it occasionally experiences extreme weather conditions such as the heavy snowfalls of 11–14 January 1987, March 2005, February 2009 and January 2010. In the late 18th century Hasted commented: \"Being exposed to the northern aspect, it lies very bleak and cold.\"\n\nMuch of the local woodland was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A significant part of the exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after replanting, has only recently shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long-standing trees. However, some 25 years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage.\n\nThe countryside around the village has been described as \"an area where the whole landscape is a piece of history—a valley where time has stood still and the pattern of woods and fields is much as it was 500 years ago\". A designated ancient woodland lies to the north-west of the village. Predominantly centred on \"Barrows Wood\" but also including \"High Wood\" and \"Trundle Wood\", this is likely a remnant of the woodland described by Hasted: \"... at the northern boundary of the parish there is a considerable quantity of wood, consisting mostly of hazel and oak, with numbers of trees of the latter, interspersed among them, which are but small, never here growing to any size.\" An ancient track that passes through the remnants of this woodland has been damaged by the use of off-road vehicles leading to attempts by local landowners to block \"Drake Lane\", a byway that runs through \"Drake Lane Wood\" in the south-west of the parish and which may have been used by recruits of Sir Francis Drake's navy. Deep water-logged ruts in the track have resulted in the partial resurfacing of the route.\n\nThe village stretches primarily along a single carriageway road known as \"The Street\". The north-eastern end of \"The Street\" is a designated Conservation Area. The lack of development stems from its position within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to a high level of scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted, and large-scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential cul-de-sac \"Draysfield\".\n\nThe record in the Domesday Book does not give the population in 1086, though several people are named. By the late 19th century the village and parish were described as:\nWORMSHILL, a parish in Hollingbourn\" <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> \"district, Kent; 5 miles S by W of Sittingbourne r. station. It has a post-office under Sittingbourne. Acres, 1,467. Real property, £1,295. Pop., 253. Houses, 46. The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Canterbury. Value, £260.* Patron, Christ's Hospital, London. The church is plain. Charities, £12.\nWormshill's location remains rural. Because of geography and restrictions on development, building in the village has been scant since the 1960s and 1970s. In 1821, the parish contained only 26 dwellings: by 2001, the total number of houses had risen to 82.\n\nThe rural nature of the area is indicated by a population density of approximately 0.4 persons per hectare (1 person for every 6.9 acres), compared to the average for the south-east of England of 4.2 persons per hectare (1 person for every 0.6 acres).\n\nThe village has been recorded as a distinct parish unit for the purpose of census statistics since the first United Kingdom census in 1801. The majority of the official population of 198 (per United Kingdom Census 2001) is aged 45 or over and lives in homes comprising married family units. The total population has increased by around 40 people since 1801 however, during the past 200 years, it has fluctuated more widely within that range. In 1801 the population was 157 before peaking at 253 in 1861. In 1901 census records indicate a parish population of either 163 or 169.\nData for the ethnicity of the wider Maidstone area show that the population is around 97 percent white and that the remainder is of mixed, black, and Asian descent. Specific figures for Wormshill held by Kent County Council indicated in 2001 that all the villagers were of white ethnicity.\n\nWormshill includes two farms: \"Yew Tree Farm\" (dairy farming) at the south end of the village, and \"Norwood Farm\" (fruit and other crops) at the north end. A third farm, \"Home Farm\" appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. This farm is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898. According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid-to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100 years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as \"labourers and servants\". The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The socio-economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were \"lower managerial and professional occupations\" (21.9 percent) and \"small employers and own account workers\" (15.2 percent).\n\nUntil the end of the 20th century, the village had a post office and general stores along with a public house, \"The Blacksmiths Arms\", a Grade II listed building, in part of 17th century origin.\n\nThe original post office opened in 1847 and was run by church warden Tom Clements from a building next to the rectory. The building, which now forms part of a Grade II* listed private dwelling, is thought to be the second-oldest surviving post office building in England with a service dating from 1847. The post office briefly moved to another location in \"The Street\" under the stewardship of local schoolmistress Fanny Harris (who operated the service from 1926); however, it returned to the original site in 1946 under the new sub-postmistress Irene Bugden and was run as a small general stores until it closed in 1976. Fanny Harris (then 92 years old and the village's oldest inhabitant) and Robin Leigh-Pemberton were passengers on the first postbus service on 4 March 1974. A new post office and stores operated at a different property in the village for a further 20 years until it was closed in the 1990s. Today, the village retains only the \"Blacksmiths Arms\" and a traditional red post box.\n\nIn the 19th century, an additional public house existed at the northern edge of the village near \"Norwood Farm\" and was known as \"The Woodman's Arms\" (and possibly also as \"The Norwood Arms\"). The pub was recorded on Ordnance Survey maps of the village between 1870 and 1946, but as of May 2012, the building is a Grade II listed private dwelling. Other listed buildings in the village include the timber-framed houses \"Norwood Manor\" and \"Blacksmiths Cottage\". A large country house now known as \"Wormshill Court\" and bordered to the north and east by a brick wall includes the outbuildings of \"Manor Farm\". The property is part of a large estate which has for several generations belonged to the Nightingale family. The house and farm is also shown on a map of 1636 and at that time appears to represent the only building in the village other than the church and the rectory. In 1858 a further map of the manor named the property \"Court Lodge Farm\" and included an inset plan showing the exchange of land between the governors of Christ's Hospital and a Mr. Henry Hudson.\n\nWormshill retained its own telephone exchange until the 1990s, when it became part of the Maidstone exchange. A red telephone box remains in the village after residents insisted that it not be replaced with a modern design however the telephony was disconnected (and the box sealed) in November 2009 as a result of lack of use. An informal village noticeboard is on the side of an old flint and wood barn that was part of the former \"Home Farm\". The post box and telephone box are at the same location. The telephone box is a listed building.\n\nThe Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway attracts tourists and railway enthusiasts throughout the summer season. The railway is a narrow gauge light railway run between two small stations on about of track built in woodland between Bredgar and Wormshill.\n\nA number of ancient trackways including the Pilgrims' Way and the North Downs Way (now designated as footpaths or byways) pass within a few miles of the village. Wormshill is not on any major roadways and has no rail service. No standard public transport facilities or taxicab operations exist in the village. A daily Postbus service, incorporated into the village postal delivery and collection timetable and which ran for 35 years, stopped on 14 November 2009. It was one of the last remaining postbus services in the United Kingdom. The service, run by the Royal Mail and subsidised by the county council, began in March 1974 and collected residents from Wormshill and other villages en route to Sittingbourne. The closure of the only means of public transport to and from the village was controversial and, following a campaign by local councillors and journalists, the postbus was replaced by a temporary minibus service, funded by the county council. Royal Mail postal deliveries continue to be made to the village. The village lies between the M2 and M20 motorways, and the nearest railway station is at Harrietsham on the Maidstone Line, to the south by road.\n\nA small one-roomed National school (a school established by the National Society for Promoting Religious Education) was built in the village in 1872 for about 30 children. However some evidence exists that it had \"accommodation for forty-two children and an average attendance of twenty-eight\". The school was recorded on maps of the village until 1909, although it was dissolved in 1930 (school mistresses Miss Fanny Harris and Miss Pepper later ran the post office and general store from an outhouse at Flint Cottage). The building that housed the school has since been converted to a private dwelling. The school's small playground was lined by lime trees planted in memory of a general at the end of the Boer Wars. As of November 2011 the lime trees are still there.\nThe nearest primary school to the village is the Milstead and Frinsted Church of England School at Milstead. Secondary school pupils are educated in the towns of Sittingbourne or Maidstone.\n\nThe church, parts of which date back to the Norman era, is dedicated to Saint Giles and forms part of the united benefice of Tunstall and Bredgar, along with the villages of Rodmersham, Milstead, Bicknor and Frinsted. The ecclesiastical parish of Wormshill is in the Diocese of Canterbury and the Sittingbourne deanery (within the archdeaconry of Maidstone). As of March 2018, the rector was the Reverend Alan Pinnegar.\nIn 1995, the church received a new ring of six bells after a campaign by villagers begun in 1944 by Michael Nightingale of Cromarty, who at age 16 opened a savings account with 10 shillings for the restoration of the church's bells. Fifty years later, he completed the full ring of six bells: one of the six was original, and the other five were rescued from abandoned churches. The last major renovations of the church occurred in 1789 and 1901.\nOf note within the church are a Norman font and Tudor pulpit. The church also contains a 13th century chest, first discovered in the early 20th century. The former rectory is now a private dwelling.\n\nA vicar at the Rectory of Wormshill in the 19th century, Reverend Josiah Disturnell, was the subject of a debate about exceptional human longevity; it was claimed that he lived to age 107. References to the rector's memorial stone in the church ultimately provided evidence that his actual age of death was \"either 91 or 93\". Sir Henry Rew, a leading authority on agricultural economics, a former assistant secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and president of the Royal Statistical Society (1920–1922) died at his home in the village on 7 April 1929.\n\nIn January 2007, the church and its surroundings were used as locations in the filming of an episode of \"EastEnders\", broadcast in the United Kingdom over the Easter 2007 holiday season. The production crew added mock gravestones and a temporary Victorian-style street lamp to the churchyard. Also featured were other locations in and near the village, including exterior shots of the \"Blacksmiths Arms\" combined with interior views of the nearby \"Ringlestone Inn\".\n\nThe village holds typical English rural festivals during the year. The spring and harvest festivals are horticultural shows that include the surrounding villages. The country fair (or fête) in the summer previously included traditional country games, stalls and attractions such as hay bale throwing, tug of war and a coconut shy, although the village has not held a fête since 2009. Wormshill contains a community village hall and recreation ground, including a small playground. The 9th Sittingbourne (Tunstall and Wormshill) Scout Group are associated with the village and group meetings are occasionally held at the village hall. Wormshill, together with the united benefice villages of Bredgar, Milstead, Bicknor and Frinsted, also produces a free monthly \"Parish Magazine\" including village news, announcements and occasional articles. In common with a number of rural communities in the county, Wormshill also receives a weekly mobile library service run by Kent County Council.\n\n"}

{"id": "2228726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228726", "title": "Surface charge", "text": "Surface charge\n\nSurface charge is a two-dimensional surface with non-zero electric charge. These electric charges are constrained on this 2-D surface, and surface charge density, measured in coulombs per square meter (C•m), is used to describe the charge distribution on the surface. The electric potential is continuous across a surface charge and the electric field is discontinuous, but not infinite; this is unless the surface charge consists of a dipole layer. In comparison, the potential and electric field both diverge at any Point Charge or Linear Charge.\n\nIn physics, at equilibrium, an ideal conductor has no charge on its interior; Instead, the entirety of the charge of the conductor resides on the surface. However, this only applies to the ideal case of infinite electrical conductivity; The majority of the charge of an actual conductor resides within the skin depth of the conductor's surface. For dielectric materials, upon the application of an external electric field, the positive charges and negative charges in the material will slightly move in opposite directions, resulting in polarization density in the bulk body and bound charge at the surface.\n\nIn chemistry, there are many different processes which can lead to a surface being charged, including adsorption of ions, protonation/deprotonation, and, as discussed above, the application of an external electric field. Surface charge emits an electric field, which causes particle repulsion and attraction, affecting many colloidal properties.\n\nSurface charge practically always appears on the particle surface when it is placed into a fluid. Most fluids contain ions, positive (cations) and negative (anions). These ions interact with the object surface. This interaction might lead to the adsorption of some of them onto the surface. If the number of adsorbed cations exceeds the number of adsorbed anions, the surface would have a net positive electric charge.\n\nDissociation of the surface chemical group is another possible mechanism leading to surface charge.\n\nSurface charge density is defined as the amount of electric charge, q, that is present on a surface of given area, A:\n\nformula_1\n\nAccording to Gauss’s law, a conductor at equilibrium carrying an applied current has no charge on its interior. Instead, the entirety of the charge of the conductor resides on the surface, and can be expressed by the equation:\n\nformula_2\n\nwhere E is the electric field caused by the charge on the conductor and formula_3 is the permittivity of the free space. This equation is only strictly accurate for conductors with infinitely large area, but it provides a good approximation if E is measured at the surface of the conductor.\n\nWhen a surface is immersed in a solution containing electrolytes, it develops a net surface charge. This is often because of ionic adsorption. Aqueous solutions universally contain positive and negative ions (cations and anions, respectively), which interact with partial charges on the surface, adsorbing to and thus ionizing the surface and creating a net surface charge. This net charge results in a surface potential [L], which causes the surface to be surrounded by a cloud of counter-ions, which extends from the surface into the solution, and also generally results in repulsion between particles. The larger the partial charges in the material, the more ions are adsorbed to the surface, and the larger the cloud of counter-ions. A solution with a higher concentration of electrolytes also increases the size of the counter-ion cloud. This ion/counterion layer is known as the electric double layer.\n\nA solution's pH can also greatly affect surface charge because functional groups present on the surface of particles can often contain oxygen or nitrogen, two atoms which can be protonated or deprotonated to become charged. Thus, as the concentration of hydrogen ions changes, so does the surface charge of the particles. At a certain pH, the average surface charge will be equal to zero; this is known as the point of zero charge (PZC). A list of common substances and their associated PZCs is shown to the right.\n\nAn interface is defined as the common boundary formed between two different phases, such as between a solid and gas. Electric potential, or charge, is the result of an object's capacity to be moved in an electric field. An interfacial potential is thus defined as a charge located at the common boundary between two phases (for example, an amino acid such as glutamate on the surface of a protein can have its side chain carboxylic acid deprotonated in environments with pH greater than 4.1 to produce a charged amino acid at the surface, which would create an interfacial potential). Interfacial potential is responsible for the formation of the electric double layer, which has a broad range of applications in what is termed electrokinetic phenomena. The development of the theory of the electric double layer is described below.\n\nThe model dubbed the 'electric double layer' was first introduced by Hermann von Helmholtz. It assumes that a solution is only composed of electrolytes, no reactions occur near the electrode which could transfer electrons, and that the only Van der Waals interactions are present between the ions in solution and the electrode. These interactions arise only due to the charge density associated with the electrode which arises from either an excess or deficiency of electrons at the electrode's surface. To maintain electrical neutrality the charge of the electrode will be balanced by a redistribution of ions close to its surface. The attracted ions thus form a layer balancing the electrode's charge. The closest distance an ion can come to the electrode will be limited to the radius of the ion plus a single solvation sphere around an individual ion. Overall, two layers of charge and a potential drop from the electrode to the edge of the outer layer (outer Helmholtz Plane) are observed.\nGiven the above description, the Helmholtz model is equivalent in nature to an electrical capacitor with two separated plates of charge, for which a linear potential drop is observed at increasing distance from the plates. \nThe Helmholtz model, while a good foundation for the description of the interface does not take into account several important factors: diffusion/mixing in solution, the possibility of adsorption on to the surface and the interaction between solvent dipole moments and the electrode.\n\nGouy-Chapman theory describes the effect of a static surface charge on a surface's potential. \"Gouy suggested that interfacial potential at the charged surface could be attributed to the presence of a number of ions of given charge attached to its surface, and to an equal number of ions of opposite charge in the solution.\" A positive surface charge will form a double layer, since negative ions in solution tend to balance the positive surface charge. Counter ions are not rigidly held, but tend to diffuse into the liquid phase until the counter potential set up by their departure restricts this tendency. The kinetic energy of the counter ions will, in part, affect the thickness of the resulting diffuse double layer. The relation between C, the counter ion concentration at the surface, and formula_4, the counter ion concentration in the external solution, is the Boltzmann factor:\n\nformula_5\n\nWhere z is the charge on the ion, e is the charge of a proton, k is the Boltzmann constant and ψ is the potential of the charged surface.\n\nThis however is inaccurate close to the surface, because it assumes that molar concentration is equal to activity. It also assumes that ions were modeled as point charges and was later modified. An improvement of this theory, known as the modified Gouy-Chapman theory, included the finite size of the ions with respect to their interaction with the surface in the form of a plane of closest approach.\n\nThe relation between surface charge and surface potential can be expressed by the Grahame equation, derived from the Gouy-Chapman theory by assuming the electroneutrality condition, which states that the total charge of the double layer must be equal to the negative of the surface charge. Using the one-dimensional Poisson equation and assuming that, at an infinitely great distance, the potential gradient is equal to 0, the Grahame equation is obtained:\n\nformula_6\n\nFor the case of lower potentials, formula_7 can be expanded to formula_7 = formula_9 formula_10 formula_11, and formula_12 is defined as the Debye length. Which leads to the simple expression:\n\nformula_13\n\nThe Otto Stern model of the double layer is essentially a combination of Helmholtz and Gouy-Chapman theories. His theory states that ions do have finite size, so cannot approach the surface closer than a few nanometers. Through a distance known as the Stern Layer, ions can be adsorbed onto the surface up to a point referred to as the slipping plane, where the ions adsorbed meet the bulk liquid. At the slipping plane the potential Ψ has decreased to what is known as the zeta potential. Although zeta potential is an intermediate value, it is sometimes considered to be more significant than surface potential as far as electrostatic repulsion is concerned.\n\nCharged surfaces are extremely important and are used in many applications. For example, solutions of large colloidal particles depend almost entirely on repulsion due to surface charge in order to stay dispersed. If these repulsive forces were to be disrupted, perhaps by the addition of a salt or a polymer, the colloidal particles would no longer be able to sustain suspension and would subsequently flocculate.\n\nElectrokinetic phenomena refers to a variety of effects resulting from an electrical double layer. A noteworthy example is electrophoresis, where a charged particle suspended in a media will move as a result of an applied electrical field. Electrophoresis is widely used in biochemistry to distinguish molecules, such as proteins, based on size and charge. Other examples include electro-osmosis, sedimentation potential, and streaming potential.\n\nProteins often have groups present on their surfaces that can be ionized or deionized depending on pH, making it relatively easy to change the surface charge of a protein. This has particularly important ramifications on the activity of proteins that function as enzymes or membrane channels, mainly, that the protein's active site must have the right surface charge in order to be able to bind a specific substrate.\n\nCharged surfaces are often useful in creating surfaces that will not adsorb certain molecules (for example, in order to prevent the adsorption of basic proteins, a positively charged surface should be used). Polymers are very useful in this respect in that they can be functionalized so that they contain ionizable groups, which serve to provide a surface charge when submerged in an aqueous solution.\n"}

He was born in the northern Honduran department of Santa Bárbara on 3 June 1849 to Saturnino Bográn Bonilla and Gertrudis Barahona Leiva. He was a member of a prominent and wealthy political family. The last name \"Bográn\" derives from the French surname \"Beaugrand\". Luis Bográn was half-brother and first cousin of future president Francisco Bográn (5 October 1919 - 1 February 1920) and first cousin of future president Miguel Paz Barahona (1 February 1925 - 1 February 1929).\n\nAfter successfully completing his secondary school studies in his home town, a young Luis Bográn pursued a law degree at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, and later pursued a career in the military. Bográn reached the rank of General within a few years, after successful military campaigns against Salvadoran military adversaries attempting to infiltrate national territory. He married Teresa Morejon Ferrera in 1878.

He founded the Escuela de Artes y Oficios (National School of Arts), the Academia Científico-Literario (Literary-Scientific Academy), and the Tipografia Nacional (National Typography/Press). He also attracted substantial foreign investment, especially into the agricultural arena, which resulted in job creation and economic development of the northern coast. He improved the infrastructure of the capital city, Tegucigalpa. President Luis Bográn also initiated the process of research and investigation in the ruins of the ancient Mayan city of Copan by inviting foreign universities to study the artifacts and architecture left behind by the Mayans.

It consists of a six or seven letter \"stem\" (often, but not always, an acceptable word itself), paired with a phrase in which each letter can be added to the stem and rearranged (anagrammed) to form a new word. Typical stems are sets of six or seven letters, as such anamonics aid in learning and in finding valuable seven- and eight-letter bingo (UK: \"bonus\") plays. Just as importantly, a player can quickly verify that he or she should not waste valuable time looking for a word in a set of letters that is ruled out by an anamonic.\n\nA successful anamonic will typically have some memorable semantic relationship to the stem. It will usually avoid unnecessary or easily confused words, which might lead to a misconception of just which letters combine with the stem.\n\nWhen no vowel combines with the stem, an anamonic phrase will typically make use of multiple vowels that are meant to be ignored. A skilled Scrabble player will typically be able to verify that at least one of these vowels does not form an acceptable word with the stem, thereby avoiding confusion.\n\nAuthorship of particularly noteworthy anamonics is often acknowledged, although this is not necessarily expected by the Scrabble community. \n\nTSUNAMI: COASTAL HARM\n\n\nThe term \"anamonics\" was coined in a private letter to Nick Ballard in 1993. The coiner was Bob Lipton, who was probably the first or second player in history to make extensive use of anamonics before they even had a name. Lipton's first anamonics were constructed in the summer of 1987. It was Ballard who first popularized the technique in a series of articles published in the now-defunct newsletter \"Medleys.\"\n\n"}

This saves the trouble and expenses of constructing a second, new set, though they face the difficulty of doing it so the average viewer does not notice the same set is reused. Also there could be logistical problems, such as conflicting shooting schedules, continuity if the set is not quite the same as it was (if it should be the same) or different (if it should be). The latter problem arises because the set dresser may be unaware of changes created by the action.\n\nA good example of a successful redress occurred in the film \"\" where the bridges of the \"Enterprise\" and the \"Reliant\" were filmed on the same set. Some of the reasons for its success are as follows:\n\nHowever, such perfect circumstances are rare and any Trekkie will be quick to point out that the schematics seen on \"Reliant\" are clearly those of the \"Enterprise\".\n\nDuring Hollywood's studio era, the disparate studios often maintained standing sets (interior and exterior) which were intended for long-term use over multiple productions, with only minimal re-dressing. This often led to audience members recognising sets which had appeared in previous films. A double feature of two Twentieth Century-Fox films of the mid-1950s, \"O. Henry's Full House\" and \"We're Not Married\", caused unintended laughter when two different street scenes from the respective films—a street in Manhattan circa 1900, and a street in New Orleans in the present—were very obviously the same exterior set.\n\n"}

It is a Grade I listed building.\n\nGladstone's Library is Britain's only Prime Ministerial Library and the national memorial to the Victorian statesman, and four times Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone (1809–98).\n\nIt is home to a collection of more than 250,000 printed items, including theological, historical, cultural and political materials.\n\nThe library was founded by William Gladstone in 1894. He was eager to share his personal library with others, especially those who faced financial constraint. He would allow bright children and young adults of the village of Hawarden to use his collection. His desire, his daughter Mary Gladstone said, was to \"bring together books who had no readers with readers who had no books\".\n\nIn 1895, at the age of 85, William Gladstone gave £40,000 and much of his own library. Armed with only his valet and one of his daughters, William Gladstone wheeled 32,000 books three quarters of a mile between his home at Hawarden Castle and the library. He unpacked them and put them onto shelves using his own catalogue system.\n\nIn a diary entry (dated 23 December 1895) he concisely described the library's founding thus: \n\"I have this day constituted my trust at St Deiniol's. The cost of the work has been I think £41 to £42000, including some charges of maintenance to Dec. 31. 95. May God of His mercy prosper it.\" \n\nFollowing his death in 1898, a public appeal was launched for funds to provide a permanent building to house the collection and to replace the temporary structure. The £9,000 raised provided an imposing building, designed by John Douglas, which was officially opened by Earl Spencer on 14 October 1902 as the National Memorial to W.E. Gladstone. The Gladstone family were themselves to fulfill the founder's vision by funding the residential wing, which welcomed its first resident on 29 June 1906.\n\nToday the library has 26 bedrooms, a restaurant called Food For Thought, a chapel and conference facilities. It hosts a year long programme of events based around William Gladstone's core interest areas of religion and theology, history and politics, and 19th-century literary culture.\n\nThe library's reading rooms are open to visitors on short guided tours only at 12pm, 2pm and 4pm each weekday.\n\nIn March 2018, Gladstone's Library and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) announced a £4.5 million Living Heritage Project to build a new building and refurbish the existing grade I listed historical library. In June 2018 four architectural companies were shortlisted—AOC Architecture, Caruso St John Architects, Hopkins Architects, and Simpson & Brown—each receiving £4,000 to develop a proposal.\n\nIn July 2018 the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) announced that Caruso St John had won the competition to design the new building for Gladstone's Library.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2228766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228766", "title": "XBAND", "text": "XBAND\n\nXBAND (stylized as XBⱯND) was the first competitive online console gaming network, and was available for Super NES and Genesis systems. It was produced by Catapult Entertainment, a Cupertino, California-based software company. It is the only modem released in America to have been officially licensed by Nintendo. It debuted in various areas of the United States in late 1994 and 1995. Online console gaming networks were eventually stabilized in the sixth and later generations of video games, such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo Switch Online.\n\nThe Genesis version of the XBAND was released in November 1994, with the Super NES version following in June 1995. The Genesis version also works with the Genesis Nomad.\n\nIn 1995, Catapult Entertainment signed a deal with General Instrument, producers of the Sega Channel, which stipulated that the XBand modem would henceforth be built into new Sega Channel adapters, and that the top 5 to 10 games offered by Sega Channel each month would be wired for play over XBand.\n\nInitially, Catapult Entertainment had a limited staff and virtually no advertising. By January 1996, XBAND network playability had reached practically every metropolitan area and several rural areas in the U.S. The actual XBAND modems were carried by a handful of software and video rental chains across the United States. Internationally, the XBAND saw some limited expansion in the Japanese market, and Catapult was working on PC- and Sega Saturn-based versions of the platform, though they merged with Mpath Interactive, and the focus shifted to the online PC gaming service, Mplayer.com.\n\nThe concept of playing online was fairly new at the time. Arcades were still quite popular, and online gaming was not yet a household idea.\n\nThe XBAND modem was widely available at Blockbuster Video branches during its time. It retailed for $19.99, with additional charges based on usage. Two pricing plans were available. One had a monthly fee of $4.95 and allowed the user to connect to the service up to 50 times a month with each additional connection costing 15 cents. The other had a monthly fee of $9.95 and granted the subscriber an unlimited number of connections per month. Activities that consumed a player's monthly allowance of connections included dialing into the XBAND service for matchmaking, downloading mail (called \"XMAIL\"), and downloading the daily edition of the two XBAND newsletters, one containing generic news and the other containing platform-specific information such as leaderboards and contest announcements. Players were also assessed a fee of $3.95/hour for connecting to opponents outside their local calling area; player-to-player connections inside their local calling area were free.\n\nThe modem features built-in storage for up to four users (\"codenames\"). It stores user friend lists, which can contain the codenames of up to ten of the user's friends; the users' XMAIL boxes, storing up to ten incoming and ten outgoing messages for each user; the users' rankings, win/loss records, and accumulated scores; a short profile section; and the user's avatar (chosen from 40 preset avatars). Text entry is done either through an on-screen keyboard or an optional XBAND keyboard add-on released later in the network's lifespan.\n\nThe client-side system worked by manipulating the game's memory in a way similar to Game Genie and third-party computer game modifications such as Multi Theft Auto.\n\nA problem of most online services of the time was that the connection would be lost whenever a phone on the same line was picked up. The XBand operating system was designed to ensure that connections are not lost due to phone activity; in the case of call waiting, the system would alert the user to the call and allow the game to be resumed.\n\nXBAND had an official website where a member could check any other player's statistics, along with other information and updates that were not available to view on consoles.\n\nAt its height, XBAND had 15,000 subscribed members.\n\nA 1995 article in \"Next Generation\" stated that the XBAND modem's \"ultra-low latency is the key to its successful handling of realtime videogaming\". The modem's data transfer rate was 2,400 bits per second, which, while low compared to PC modems of the time, was sufficient to handle the simple one-on-one games which XBAND was used with.\n\nWhen connecting to play, unless a player specified a particular user from their friend list, players would be matched with a random player elsewhere in the country (or the player's local area code depending on their preference settings) who was also connecting to play the same game. The server would attempt to match players of like skill levels, using the Elo rating system. When the network matched two players up, the newly-connected player's XBAND modem would disconnect from the server and dial the other player, whose own XBAND modem would answer when the phone rang. At that point the players would see the XBAND logo slide together, followed by the matchup screen, which displayed each player's codenames, avatars, locations, and a pre-typed \"taunt\".\n\nIn December 1995 XBAND launched its first national tournament. This is the first modem to modem tournament ever to be held over a console. The grand prize winner received a special Genghis Khan icon for their XBAND profile and a $200 cash prize from Catapult. Peter Kappes aka \"SphiNX\" of Orlando, FL became the first person in history to win a modem to modem national tournament over a console.\n\nDuring the last few months of service, several users discovered a way to use a Game Genie to hack the icons of XBAND players. This enabled players to use icons that were otherwise restricted, such as unreleased icons or icons reserved for matches between XBAND team members. Icon hacking resulted in complaints from other users. Rumors about XBAND icon hackers often claimed they were part of elite hacking organizations or members of Catapult Entertainment. Eventually, the method used by the hackers was leaked and inevitably spread throughout the community. \n\nBy March 16, 1997, people could only play within their local area code. On April 30, 1997, the entire network was removed, with Mpath citing a lack of new games for the Genesis and Super NES.\n\nXBAND had announced in their previous monthly newsletter that they were shutting down. According to \"Next Generation\", XBAND \"never turned a significant profit\". During XBAND's existence, only a handful of advertisements were ever made, and only one game, \"Weaponlord\", had the XBAND logo on its box. XBAND stated in their newsletter that players were their best form of advertising, and offered the \"XBAND 6 pack\", where members could order six modems at a discounted rate and receive a month of free gaming in exchange for signing up a certain number of people to the service.\n\nHeavy contributors to XBAND's demise were the lack of support from game developers and limited internal resources. With the exception of \"Weaponlord\", Catapult had to individually reverse engineer each game's code, then develop a hack to intercept two-player activity so the game could be shared over a low-latency (fast response time), 2400-baud modem connection.\n\nCatapult's second generation attempts were blocked by the hardware manufacturers. The XBAND was launched in Japan on April 1, 1996 for the Sega Saturn. Unlike the SNES and Genesis versions of XBAND, it did not require an XBAND-specific modem, instead utilizing Sega's own Sega NetLink device (which included a 14,400 baud modem in Japan and a 28,800 baud modem in North America). Despite this, neither the Saturn XBAND nor an expansion into the PC market panned out, as developers frequently opted to include their own network linking rather than deal with Catapult's subscription-based service.\n\nA major issue for the XBAND service was free long-distance phone calls. It was discovered that a user could record the tones sent from an XBAND modem and then receive the long-distance service number, the authentication code, and phone number of the player you were connecting to. This information allowed anyone to access long-distance phone calls that were charged to Catapult.\n\nPaging company SkyTel faced similar problems from both XBAND users and their own customers. XBAND users performed brute-force attacks against SkyTel's mobile paging system in order to discover voicemail boxes using the same number as the login and password, using these to extend their communication with each other. Most messages consisted simply of shout-outs with music playing in the background.\n\nA common complaint was that if a player was losing a match, they could simply pull their phone cord out or reset their system. This tactic, known as \"cord-pulling\" among XBAND users, prevented the XBAND service from crediting either player with the win or loss. In response to complaints, the company developed a program which would detect such forced disconnections and assign a loss to the perpetrator and a win to the victim. However, this led to a flood of calls from users claiming that their reset button had been pushed by accident and demanding that the loss be erased from their record; facing unsustainable customer service costs, Catapult changed the program so that while victims of cord-pulling were awarded a win, perpetrators were no longer penalized in any way.\n\nDespite poor marketing success, the XBAND team did manage some publicity gains when they joined forces with a number of gaming magazines, starting on the web with Game Zero magazine and later in Tips & Tricks Magazine. Daily stats were accessible via 'XBAND News' on the modem, although they were not visible to the general public. Publishing stats added a \"cool\" factor to brag about in the early forefronts of online gaming. The top-ranked gamers of the previous month were published starting in January 1996 in Game Zero and, starting in early 1996, in Tips & Tricks magazine as well.\n\nThe following games have been analyzed, and online compatibility provided, by XBAND. Additionally, a hidden maze game could be unlocked in the SNES version by inserting a \"\" cartridge.\n\n\n"}

An aqueduct existed, the remains of which were incorporated into a latter medieval renovation. Locations for the theater and amphitheater were also proposed, but still unconfirmed by archeology. A triumphal arch is documented, but was destroyed in 1778. Also a necropolis was located to the east of the city.\n\nThe Suebi razed the nearby township of Conímbriga in 468. Its inhabitants, who had meanwhile fled to Aeminium, kept the original name of their town.\n\nIn modern Coimbra there are few remains from ancient Aeminium.

Original members included Cub Koda (guitarist/vocalist), Mike Lutz (guitarist/vocalist), T.J. Cronley (drummer), and Tony Driggins (bassist/vocals). Later members included Henry \"H-Bomb\" Weck (drummer) and Bruce Nazarian (guitarist/vocalist).\n\nThey are remembered for the top-10 hit single \"Smokin' in the Boys Room\" (1973).\n\nBrownsville Station was formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1969. Brownsville Station's early albums included song covers from bands which had inspired them. In 1970, they released their debut studio album, \"No BS\", on a Warners Bros. label. Their biggest hit, \"Smokin' in the Boys Room\", written by Michael Lutz & Cub Koda, from their 1973 album \"Yeah!\", reached No. 3 on U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart. The track sold over two million copies and was awarded a gold disc status by the RIAA on 15 January 1974.\n\nIn 1977, Brownsville Station recorded \"Martian Boogie\", one of their seven singles to chart on the Hot 100. The song was also a feature on Dr. Demento's radio show. \"(Lady) Put The Light On\", their penultimate single, also charted in the Hot 100, at 46.\n\nAfter drummer Cronley left the band, Van Wert, Ohio native Henry \"H-Bomb\" Weck was called on to fill the position left by Cronley.\n\nThe band's second-highest Billboard charting single was \"Kings of the Party\" which topped out at No. 31 in 1974.\n\nOriginal members of Brownsville Station disbanded in 1979 and their final studio album together, \"Air Special\", was released by Epic in 1978.\n\nCub Koda was the most visible Brownsville Station member after their break up. He recorded a number of solo albums and toured with his own group The Points as well as blues man Hound Dog Taylor's backing band The Houserockers. His solo repertoire included the albums \"Cub Koda and the Points\", \"It's the Blues\", \"Box Lunch\" and the career spanning compilation \"Welcome to My Job\". In addition, Koda, a rabid collector of rockabilly, doo wop and blues, wrote liner notes for numerous retro releases (including Jimmy Reed, Freddy Cannon and The Kingsmen) and countless music reviews for the All Music Guide series of books and website. He also wrote a popular column (\"The Vinyl Junkie\") for Goldmine magazine and co-authored the book \"Blues For Dummies\". In addition, he hosted \"The Cub Koda Crazy Show\" for Massachusetts radio station WCGY during a period in the early 80s. Koda died of kidney disease in July 2000 at the age of 51.\n\nMike Lutz went on to produce many bands, including Ted Nugent's \"Spirit of the Wild\" album, and toured in the 1990s with Nugent. Lutz still resides in Ann Arbor, teaches guitar and bass at a local music store called Oz's Music, writes and produces many acts.\n\nWhile still in Brownsville Station, Henry Weck engineered and co-produced the \"Strikes\" album for Blackfoot, which produced two hit singles, Highway Song and Train Train (on which Koda played harmonica). Weck continues to record and produce in Memphis, in Ann Arbor at Lutz's Tazmania Studios and is the co-driving force of the re-united Brownsville Station.\n\nAfter T. J. Cronley left Brownsville Station, he spent a career in the U.S. Marine Corps as a Marine aviator, and retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1992. He is currently a pilot for FedEx and resides in Yuma, Arizona. He is also an artist.\n\nBruce Nazarian went on to produce, engineer and perform with his band \"The Automatix\", who released their debut LP on MCA in 1983. He was the CEO of Digital Media Consulting Group and ran a popular digital media website \"TheDigitalGuy.com\". Nazarian also produced and hosted The Digital Guy radio show in addition to being a music producer, concert impresario and artist manager. His last band, \"The Brotherhood\" is slated to release their debut CD \"(It's) All About The Groove\" in early 2016. Nazarian died in October 2015.\n\nIn 2008, Brownsville Station was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.\n\nThrough the band's early days, Weck captured over 500 hours of Brownsville demos, rehearsals, live shows and even some special events. In 2012, Lutz and Weck began sorting through the recordings in Lutz's Tazmania Studio. The result is Still Smokin', featuring new songs and updated versions of the band's \"My Friend Jack\" and “Smokin’ In The Boys Room”.\n\nAugmented by new players Billy Craig, Arlen Viecelli and Brad Johnson, Brownsville Station returned to the road in 2013.\n\nIn the television series \"King of the Hill\", Brownsville Station is part of the subplot in Episode 10 Season 10 entitled \"Hank Fixes Everything\", reuniting for the \"Still Smokin' In The Boys Room\" tour (incidentally, when the band reunited for real in 2012, their subsequent album would be titled \"Still Smokin\"').

It is also known as \"FC Saturn Moscow Region\" (\"FC Saturn Moskovskaya Oblast\").\n\nThe club was founded in 1946. Although the club is based in Ramenskoye, the club represents all Moscow Oblast. Due to huge debts it was dissolved in January 2011, but was recreated on the base of their former farm club FC Saturn-2 Moscow Region. It returned to the professional level in Russian Professional Football League in the 2013-14 season. Before the 2015–16 season, the club didn't receive the professional license and moved back to amateur levels. It returned to the third-tier once again for the 2016–17 season.\n\nTheir nickname “Aliens” (Russian инопланетяне) comes from the name 'Saturn'.\nAlso, nicknamed \"Extraterrestrials.\"\n\nIt was previously called Krylya Sovetov (1946–1957), Trud (1958–1959) and Saturn-REN TV (February 2002 to January 2004).\nIn 2006 the club beat the record of drawn matches played in the Russian Premier League during one season - 16 times.\n\nSaturn's reserve squad played professionally as FC Saturn-2 Ramenskoye in the Russian Second Division in 1999 and 2000. A separate farm club called FC Saturn-2 Moscow Oblast played in the Russian Second Division from 2009 to 2012.\n\nAs of 21 February 2020, according to the PFL website.\n\nThe football club Saturn Ramenskoye (FCSR) supporters movement was born in the second part of the 1980s when the team started playing on the professional level. The organised group of fans at that time consisted of not more than 20 people; however the first trips (Russian: выезда) to Tula, Kaluga, Pskov and other cities were already done by them in 1986.\n\nThe new age for FCSR supportive movement is connected with the year 1995. Then the famous supporter Andrey Egorishev (nicknamed \"Arsenal\") had begun to unite fans of Saturn. It is believed that the team played in black and blue colors because of him. In 1996 Saturn had played in red and white colors. Fans who disliked these colors (because of ideological views) had many discussions – and finally chose black and blue colors. Some time after that the team changed colors too.\n\nThe first union of FCSR fans – \"Dorf Menschen\" (the bumpkins; the German translates literally as \"Village People\") – was organised in January 1996. At that moment it consisted from about 15 people, but its size (as the size of FCSR fans in common) has been increasing. Many groups of fans were formed (mainly according to geographical location). Because a large number of these groups became uncontrollable, it was decided to unite them around a \"Dorf Menschen\". The South-East Confederation (Russian: «Юго-Восточная Конфедерация») was formed in this way. It was able to gather about one thousand supporters at the home game. At the moment the main FCSR band is \"BBS firm\" whose name means \"Black Blue Supporters\".\n\nAfter beginning to play in the highest Russian league, the structure of the FCSR supportive movement has been changed a lot. There are some different unions at the moment, both hooligans and ultras, which are united by the 46 km. The main enemies of Saturn fans are fans of FC Lokomotiv Moscow, FC Shinnik Yaroslavl and FC Khimki. There is the friendship between FCSR fans and fans of Torpedo Moscow and Spartak Moscow.\n\nMany FCSR fans' nicknames are connected with the aliens' club name. The black and blue fans themselves mostly use the nickname \"gumy\" (\"гумы\") (short form of Russian \"гуманоид\" – \"humanoid\").\n\nHad international caps for their respective countries.

The newspaper is owned by Lee Enterprises, which is also located in Davenport.\n\nThe \"Quad-City Times\" grew from several predecessors, including the \"Democratic Banner\" and \"Blue Ribbon News\".\n\nThe \"Democratic Banner\" was founded in 1848, was sold in 1855 to a group of businessmen and rechristened the \"Iowa State Democrat\". The \"Iowa State Democrat\" published its first edition on October 15 of that year, with E. T. Eagel its first publisher. The newspaper underwent many changes through its early history, and by 1899, its circulation was 1,300 daily and 2,500 weekly. By 1903, it was known as the \"Davenport Democrat,\" and in 1905, after purchasing its rival newspaper, \"The Davenport Leader\", the name became \"The Davenport Democrat & Leader\", under the city editorship of Ralph W. Cram. The newspaper was sold to Lee Enterprises in 1915; thereafter Cram become editor and publisher, until 1940.\n\nThe \"Blue Ribbon News\" began publication in 1878; by 1886, it was known as the \"Davenport Daily Times\". The newspaper, which struggled for many years, was sold in 1899 to A. W. Lee (founder of Lee Enterprises) for $120,000.\n\nBoth newspapers continued to grow in circulation, before combining operations in 1964. The formerly separate newspapers became known as the \"Times-Democrat\". By 1974, with circulation expanding throughout eastern Iowa and western Illinois, the newspaper was given its current name.\n\nIn December 1989, the \"Quad-City Times\" moved into its current building at 500 E. Third St., Davenport. The facility, completed at a cost of $23.8 million, includes a five-story press room, mail room, warehouse and editorial offices. The facility also houses Trico, the newspaper's commercial printing business.\n\nThe \"Quad-City Times\" has been on the leading edge of technology, becoming the first all-electronic newspaper in 1973. Electronic pagination began in 1988, with all-digital photography taking root by 1994.\n\nCurrent \"Quad-City Times\" columnists include Roy Booker, Linda Cook, Matt Coss, Jennifer DeWitt, Don Doxsie, Alma Gaul, and Barb Ickes. The current editor is Matt Christensen. Deb Anselm is the publisher of the \"Quad-City Times\".\n\nThe newspaper receives Iowa political news from Lee Enterprises' Des Moines bureau, and Illinois political news from its Springfield bureau.\n\nPreviously, the \"Quad-City Times\" published these additional editions, which have since been discontinued:\n\n\nThe \"Quad-City Times\" is available on the Amazon Kindle book reader; however without ads, classifieds and most photos and tables.\n\nOn Thursdays, the \"Bettendorf News\" is published, and the tabloid-sized included in newsstand and subscriber copies in Bettendorf, Le Claire, Pleasant Valley and Riverdale. From 1927 through sometime in the 2000s decade, the \"Bettendorf News\" was a stand-alone weekly newspaper. Since 1975, the newspaper has been owned by Lee Enterprises, and during the 2000s decade, the newspaper became a weekly section comprising features, sports recaps and community news. In the past, special weekly sections were also published for the Clinton, and both the upper and lower Rock Island County markets, but these have since been discontinued.\n\nOther publications previously produced by the \"Quad-City Times\" included:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since the late 19th century, there have been two county championship competitions played at different levels: the County Championship, a first-class competition which currently involves eighteen first-class county clubs among which seventeen are English and one is from Wales; and the Minor Counties Championship, which currently involves nineteen English county clubs and one club that represents several Welsh counties.\n\nCounty cricket started in the eighteenth century, the earliest known inter-county match being played in 1709, though an official County Championship was not instituted until 1890. Having already been badly hit by the Seven Years' War, county cricket ceased altogether during the Napoleonic Wars and there was a period from 1797 to 1824 during which no inter-county matches took place.\n\nInter-county cricket was popular throughout the 18th century, although the best team, such as Kent in the 1740s or Hampshire in the days of the famous Hambledon Club, was usually acknowledged as such by being matched against All-England. The most successful county teams were Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. There was, however, often a crossover between town and county with some strong local clubs tending at times to represent a whole county. Examples are London, which often played against county teams and was in some respects almost a county club in itself; Slindon, which was for a few years in the 1740s effectively representative of Sussex as a county; Dartford, sometimes representative of Kent; and the Hambledon Club, certainly representative of Hampshire and also perhaps of Sussex. One of the best county teams in the late 18th century was Berkshire, which no longer has first-class status.\n\nAll matches prior to 1988 were scheduled for three days, normally of a nominal six hours each plus intervals, but often with the first two days lengthened by up to an hour and the final day shortened, so that teams with fixtures elsewhere on the following day could travel at sensible hours. The exception to this was the 1919 season, when there was an experiment with two-day matches played over longer hours, up to nine o'clock in the evening in mid-summer. This experiment was not repeated. From 1988 to 1992 some matches were played over four days. From 1993 onward, all matches have been scheduled for four days.\n\nThe eighteen first-class counties are the top league cricket teams. They are named after historic English counties and include one Welsh county, Glamorgan.\n\nThe English first-class counties are:\nThe full name of the cricket team is usually formed from the name of the county followed by the words County Cricket Club, which are often abbreviated as CCC.\n\nThe opening first-class game of an English county cricket season has traditionally been played at Lord's between the MCC and the Champion County (the club that won the County Championship the previous year). When the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) plays against one of the first-class counties, the game is granted first-class status.\n\nThe six MCC-sponsored University (MCCU) teams, are also afforded first-class status for some of their matches against a first-class county. They are:\n\n\nMost of the first-class counties play three-day games against university cricket teams in the early part of the English cricket season. This is partly because the start of the cricket season coincides with the end of the university academic year, and partly because the games act as pre-season warm-ups for the county clubs.\n\nThe minor counties are the cricketing counties of England that are not afforded first-class status. Present members are :\n\nEastern Division\n\nWestern Division\n\nSome teams outside of the English counties have been allowed to take part in some English county cricket one-day competitions. They include:\n\nAn important year was 1873, when player qualification rules came into force, requiring players to choose at the start of each season whether they would play for the county of their birth or their county of residence. Before this, it was quite common for a player to play for both counties during the course of a single season. Three meetings were held, and at the last of these, held at The Oval on 9 June 1873, the following rules were decided on:\n\n\nThe County Championship is the domestic first-class cricket competition in England and Wales. All of the first-class counties compete in a two-division league format.\n\nThe Royal London One-Day Cup is a 50 over one-day cricket competition in county cricket. The 18 English county sides are divided randomly into two groups of nine with each team playing each other once. The top four in each group reach the quarter-finals. The competition culminates at Lord's for the final. The Royal London One Day Cup replaced the Yorkshire Bank 40 over League. The first winners of the competition were Durham in 2014.\n\nThe NatWest t20 Blast is a Twenty20 cricket competition contested by the eighteen first-class counties. The game is limited to 20 overs per side, and the emphasis is on fast action. It replaced the Friends Life T20 in 2014.\n\nThe competitions of minor counties cricket are the Minor Counties Cricket Championship and the MCCA Knockout Trophy.\n\nThe Women's County Championship is played each year, in a similar manner to the men's, but the Women's county game focuses upon 50 over cricket. There is also the Women's Cricket Super League, a T20 competition. Some counties are involved, and feature in a divisional structure. Promotion and relegation is a feature throughout.\n"}
{"id": "2228850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2228850", "title": "Saints and Soldiers", "text": "Saints and Soldiers\n\nSaints and Soldiers is a 2003 war drama film directed by Ryan Little and produced by Little and Adam Abel. It is loosely based on events that took place after the Malmedy massacre during the Battle of the Bulge. The film stars Corbin Allred, Alexander Niver, Lawrence Bagby, and Peter Asle Holden as the four American soldiers trying to return Kirby Heyborne, a British soldier with vital intelligence, to the Allied lines.\n\nAfter conducting research on World War II and Battle of the Bulge, Little began shooting in January 2003 in Utah. Filming lasted 30 days. Little and Abel were able to save money on production by recruiting a group of World War II reenactors who volunteered their services, costumes, and props. Excel Entertainment released the film at festivals to garner publicity before it was released to the public. The movie won numerous Best Picture awards from over 15 film festivals.\n\nCritical reception was generally positive with praise towards the message, story, performances (particularly of Allred and Niver), production values and action sequences. Though the screenplay, pacing and ties to Mormonism were criticized by some reviewers, several film scholars argued that despite the LDS-related themes, the film appeals to a wide audience. The film generated two sequels: \"\" and \"\".\n\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, the Germans open fire on their American prisoners of war, in what is known as the Malmedy massacre, killing many troops as they try to run away. Medic Steven Gould (Alexander Niver) manages to escape with Corporal Nathan 'Deacon' Greer (Corbin Allred). Gould and Deacon are joined by two other survivors, Shirl Kendrick (Larry Bagby), a member in Gould's division, and Deacon's close friend Sergeant Gordon Gunderson (Peter Asle Holden). The four stumble on RAF pilot Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley (Kirby Heyborne). Winley explains he has important intelligence photographs he has to get back to the Allies and the group decide to try and reach the Allied lines some 20 miles away. The group fights against German troops, a winter storm, and personal conflict to return Winley to Allied territory.\n\nRyan Little's first project was short film \"The Last Good War\", which won a Student Emmy. Little wanted to produce a World War II themed feature film. In 2002, new director Ryan Little teamed up with film producer Adam Abel to create the film production company, Go Pictures. After finding a private investor in California, Little and Abel sought to produce the film on a budget of $780,000. The original title of the film was \"Saints and War\". Before the film had a script, the filmmakers scouted filming locations, determining the film's plot based on available locations and props. They researched World War II events and interviewed World War II veterans to develop the story and characters.\n\nLittle and Abel quickly cast Corbin Allred and Kirby Heyborne. However, because Heyborne has appeared in many other LDS Church related movie roles, they instructed Heyborne to grow a mustache, dye his hair, use a British accent, and smoke during the movie. Because Heyborne did not smoke, he smoked herbal cigarettes in the movie and practiced dragging daily for a few weeks before filming. Additionally, Heyborne did not have access to a dialect coach so he became familiar with British accents by watching other films. Heyborne was concerned that this would make him a target for film critics. To save on costs, Little and Abel used World War II reenactors as actors who volunteered to travel to Utah and bring their World War II prop equipment at their own expense.\n\nThe film was shot in early 2003 in 30 days in Utah, Wasatch, and Salt Lake counties in Utah. Camera angles were carefully positioned to avoid showing the Wasatch mountains on camera to create the illusion of being in the Ardennes. They shot the film in January to use the available snow for their set, but they had to use potato flakes when there was not enough snow. Moreover, tight filming budgets required actors to do their own film stunts. Snow and freezing temperatures were challenges to filming which was worsened by the period clothing costumes.\n\n\"Saints and Soldiers\" was originally rated \"R\" by the MPAA, solely for war violence and related images. The director, writers, and producer wanted a rating of \"PG-13\". Some criticism has been leveled against the MPAA rating board with regard to their rating independent films more harshly than those of the large studios. (See also \"LDS cinema and MPAA ratings\".) Producers edited the film to receive a \"PG-13\" rating for commercial distribution. The film was officially granted a PG-13 rating on March 30, 2004.\n\nSeveral members of the 101st Airborne Division are depicted as being present at the massacre. In reality, the 101st was held in strategic reserve by SHAEF at this point in time to recover from combat in Operation Market-Garden. The 101st did not reach the front until December 18 (the massacre was on the 17th), and was sent to Bastogne, far to the south of where Kampfgruppe Joachim Peiper operated. Most of the victims were from the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion. Furthermore, the events of the massacre are depicted as taking place in deep snow, while in fact it snowed heavily after the massacre.\n\nThe first screening of the film was at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to an audience of U.S. Naval officers and their wives. The film opened at film festivals nationwide. \"Saints and Soldiers\" represents the first LDS film produced after 2000 to be exhibited in film festivals before general release to gain publicity. It was the highest-grossing film released by Excel Entertainment, an entertainment section which targets an LDS Church audience. It grossed over $1 million. \"Saints and Soldiers\" was released on video and DVD in May 2005. \nThe reaction to \"Saints and Soldiers\" was generally positive. The \"Washington Times\" called the film, \"one of the sharpest and most compelling entries of the early 'Mormon cinema' era\". \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film's, \"impressive cast of largely unknown actors...[and] meticulously researched film tells its story with quiet conviction.\" However, \"Variety\" insisted that the script had \"letdowns\", including anachronisms in the dialogue and other story incongruities, yet they commended the production value considering the film's low budget.\n\n\"The Seattle Times\" added that \"the film is intended as a propaganda piece for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the messages are very subtle, and the movie does have a place in the new WWII genre,\" and is \"appropriate for mainstream audiences.\" Furthermore, scholar Travis T. Anderson, affirmed that films made by LDS filmmakers such as \"Saints and Soldiers\" and \"Napoleon Dynamite\" can still develop \"widespread attention\" or \"critical acclaim\". He continued by stating that neither appeals to an exclusively LDS audience nor alienates non-LDS audiences. Moreover, scholar Terryl Givens argued that \"Saints and Soldiers\" can be interpreted specifically or universally. Givens claimed that the screenwriting created a film which is authentically Mormon yet reaches to a myriad of audiences. Although ties to Mormonism in the film have been criticized by some, Gideon O. Burton called the film, \"among the most-praised films of the Fifth Wave [of Mormon cinema] to date\".\n\n\"Saints and Soldiers\" won the 2004 Jury Award for Best Feature at the Stony Brook Film Festival. Furthermore, the film won the award for best picture at 13 other film festivals. The film was nominated for Best First Feature at the 20th Film Independent's Spirit Awards in 2004, losing to Garden State.\n\nA second film, \"\", was released on August 17, 2012. A third film, \"\", was released on August 15, 2014.\n\n"}

Later he served as a President of one of the several competing governments of Nicaragua from October 30, 1855 to June 24, 1857. However, he was merely a puppet president; rule was held by William Walker. He belonged to the Democratic Party (Liberal Party).\n\nRivas provisionally occupied the Presidency of the Republic of this Central American country during the worst period of the National War of Nicaragua, between October 25, 1855 and June 24, 1857. He had to face the parallel governments of the entreguista Fermín Ferrer (legitimist) and the usurper William Walker (filibuster).\n\nHe briefly served as interim Supreme Director of the State of Nicaragua from June 30 to July 27, 1839, before being popularly elected as Supreme Director, a position he held from September 21, 1840 to March 4, 1841 .\n\nIn 1855, Patricio Rivas was appointed Provisional President as a result of an agreement signed in Granada between the Legitimist General Ponciano Corral and the filibuster William Walker, de facto head of the democratic side. This agreement was rejected by the legitimist José María Estrada who was the Acting President.\n\nRivas had the support of Walker at the beginning of his government. Due to the patriotic attitude of the government of the Costa Rican President Juan Rafael Mora Porras against the presence of the filibusters in Nicaragua, the government of Rivas declared war on Costa Rica in early 1856, invading Guanacaste. However, the Costa Ricans commanded by Juan Rafael Mora, defeated the filibusters in the battle of Santa Rosa and the Second Battle of Rivas (not to be confused with the First Battle of June 29, 1855, and in which Enmanuele Mongalo had a heroic role to burn the Mesón de Máximo Espinoza).\n\nThe candidacies of Rivas, Máximo Jerez, and Trinidad Salazar were presented at convened elections to elect a new President. None obtained an absolute majority and it seemed that Congress was going to choose Jerez. However, Walker wanted to be called new elections. Rivas, eager to get rid of the tutelage of the filibuster, moved from Granada to León, where Walker arrived in June 1856, still in apparent cordiality. But, when Walker left, Rivas moved the government to Chinandega and repealed his decree calling for elections. Walker then announced in Granada the deposition of Rivas and his replacement by the proxy government of Fermín Ferrer.\n\nRivas declared Walker a traitor in Nicaragua, and remained at the head of the government in the western region of the country, where the armies of Guatemala and El Salvador arrived shortly after, attacking the cities of Granada and Masaya. For its part, the Costa Rican army expelled the filibusters from the San Juan river basin.\n\nWalker capitulated on May 1, 1857. Shortly thereafter, on June 24, a triumvirate took office, composed of Máximo Jerez and Tomás Martínez Guerrero, which ended the turbulent government of Patricio Rivas.\n\nRivas was popularly known with the nickname of \"Patas Arribas.\"\n"}

There are different types of fileset though the context will usually give the defining characteristic. Sometimes it is necessary to explicitly state the fileset type to avoid ambiguity, am example is the emacs editor which explicitly mentions its \"Version Control\" (VC) fileset type to distinguish from its \"named files\" fileset type.\n\nWhile there is probably no classification of fileset types some common usage cases do emerge: \n\nFileset has several meanings and usages, depending on the context. Some examples are: \n\nIn the AIX operating system installation packaging system it is the smallest individually installable unit (a collection of files that provides a specific function).\n\nDCE/DFS uses the term fileset to define a tree containing directories, files, and mount points (links to other DFS filesets). A DFS fileset is also a unit of administrative control. Properties such as data location, storage quota, and replication are controlled at this level of granularity. The concept of a fileset in DFS is essentially identical to the concept of a volume in AFS. The glamor filesystem uses the same concept of filesets. Filesets are lightweight components compared to file systems, so management of a file set is easier. \n\nIn IBM GPFS represents a set of files within a file system which have an independent inode space.\n"}

Each state-sponsored body has a sponsor Minister who acts as shareholder, either independently, or in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, who may also be a shareholder. State-sponsored bodies are often popularly called \"semi-state companies\", a misnomer, since they are all (mostly) fully owned by the state, in addition not all of them are actually companies.\n\nState-sponsored bodies may be organised as statutory corporations, meaning that they are officially non-profit and do not formally have shareholders, but have a board or other authority appointed by the sponsor Minister. Corporations of this type include:\n\n\nStatutory corporations are governed under the particular statute that they are established under, and are not subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, though similar requirements are often stated in the statute. The statutory corporation form of governance has fallen out of favour recently, with it being seen as less transparent and less commercially free than the limited company (see below). It is planned that VHI will become a limited company in the near future. On 21 January 2006 \"The Irish Times\" reported that the ESB and BGE will also move to plc status, however, both companies remained in government hands and never went to plc status. Under the draft Broadcasting Bill 2006 RTÉ and Telefís na Gaeilge would have become companies limited by guarantee, however the final Broadcasting Act 2009 retained their statutory corporation status.\n\nOthers may be organised as public limited companies or private limited companies. These are incorporated with the Companies Registration Office (Ireland) as companies, but their sole (or sometimes majority) shareholder is their sponsor minister. Some of these are exempt from the requirement to carry \"limited\", \"teoranta\", \"plc\", or \"cpt\" as part of their company name. State-sponsored bodies incorporated in this fashion are, unlike their statutory corporation peers, subject to the provisions of the Companies' Acts. They have issued share capital, a board of directors, and all the other features of the type of company they are incorporated as.\n\nIn the case of bank shareholdings, these are the results of recapitalisation during the Irish banking crisis, and are all intended to be sold in time\n\nExamples include:\n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Food and the Marine\n\nDepartment of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources\n\nDepartment of Finance\n\nDepartment of Transport, Tourism and Sport\n\nCompanies which are subsidiaries of state-sponsored bodies, but which enjoy a separate identity and legal existence, include:\n\nSubsidiaries of Córas Iompair Éireann:\n\nSubsidiaries of Dublin Airport Authority:\n\nSubsidiaries of An Post\n\nSubsidiaries of Raidió Teilifís Éireann:\n\nSubsidiary of Horse Racing Ireland\n\nLike many countries with extensive state owned sectors, the Irish Government has embarked on a programme of privatisations in recent years. Privatisations have always been controversial in Ireland. In 1991 the chief executive of Greencore was forced to resign immediately prior to the company's flotation when it was discovered he was a shareholder in a company which had been purchased by Irish Sugar prior to its flotation. However it was after the drop in the Eircom share price following the company's flotation that many became opposed to future privatisations.\n\n\n"}

Ameriflight serves major financial institutions, freight forwarders, laboratories and overnight couriers in the US and provides feeder services for overnight express carriers nationwide and internationally. Ameriflight averages 525 daily departures with over 100,000 combined flight hours annually and a 99.5% on-time performance. Ameriflight employs over 700 people (225 pilots, 140 mechanics).\n\nAmeriflight was established in 1968 as California Air Charter. The company's first route, CalAir 103, was bank mail and cancelled checks flown in a Piper Cherokee Six (PA-32) from Hollywood-Burbank Airport to Riverside Municipal Airport, and then on to Blythe Airport near the Colorado River.\n\nThe company merged in 1971 with United Couriers (UCI), a wholly owned subsidiary of ATI Systems International (ATIS). In April 1993 the fixed-wing division of Wings Express (which was based at Van Nuys Airport) was purchased, and the outstanding shares of Sports Air Travel were acquired in mid-1997. In March 2007, when Canadian company Garda Security bought ATIS, Ameriflight was sold to a group of investors including the company's president, Gary Richards.\n\nIn May 2014 the airline announced it was moving its headquarters to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Maintenance operations and flight operations are scheduled to move to DFW.\n\nIn late 2014 Ameriflight reached agreement to acquire Wiggins Airways (48 aircraft and 100 employees), which would result in Ameriflight becoming the largest regional air cargo carrier in the world with 163 aircraft in its fleet.\n\nThe majority of Ameriflight's operations consists of air feeder service for major package express integrators such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL. Other significant customers include Lantheus Medical Imaging, ACS Products, and Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. On schedules set by the customers, cargo is received in the early morning from large jet freighters at hub airports and distributed by Ameriflight airplanes to smaller communities whose traffic (or airports) would not support the big airplanes. In the evening, the Ameriflight aircraft fly back to the hubs, in order to feed them with cargo from the smaller communities, which is carried onwards to the integrators' distribution centers for sorting and redistribution to the ultimate destinations.\n\nAlthough demand is decreasing as use of digital imaging and electronic data transfer increases, Ameriflight also transports high priority intercity financial documents. Pharmaceuticals, film for development, medical laboratory samples, and other miscellaneous cargo are also carried.\n\nAmeriflight is one of the few Part 135 cargo carriers in the U.S. with a special Department of Transportation permit to carry high Transport Index radioactive cargo, an important element in the company's time-critical radioactive medical raw materials business, which transports radioactive \"generator\" materials between points of manufacture and cities where it is used to produce materials used in diagnostics and cancer therapy.\n\nIn addition to scheduled flying (with contract schedules set by customers), all Ameriflight bases can respond to unscheduled on-demand cargo flights to destinations in Alaska, Canada, throughout the contiguous U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, and into South America. A single King Air 200 was used for on-demand passenger charter flights but has since been retired.\n\nAs of early 2016, Ameriflight's headquarters are at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, with large operations centers at the following 19 bases:\n\n\nThe Ameriflight fleet includes the following aircraft (as of August 2019):\n\nIn previous times, the airline operated the following aircraft types: Cessna 402, Cessna 208 Caravan, Dassault Falcon 20, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, Learjet 35A, Mitsubishi MU-2, Piper PA-31, Piper PA-32R, Piper PA-32, Piper PA-28R, Piper PA-23 and Piper PA-31T Cheyenne.\n\n\n"}

His father, Pedro José Chamorro Argüello, had come to Guatemala from Nicaragua for graduate studies. Fruto grew up in Guatemala and attended school there. His father returned to Nicaragua after completing his studies and married Josefa Margarita Alfaro Monterroso in 1814. They had six children, but Fruto was subsequently considered a member of this family, based on strategic needs related to administration of the family resources, for which the administrator was expected to be at least 25 years of age. He was acknowledged by his father shortly before the latter's death in 1824, and his stepmother insisted he use the name Fruto Chamorro Pérez.\n\nThe death of his father forced Fruto to leave his studies and go to Nicaragua to assume responsibility for the family and to manage the abundant inheritance of his father. His half brothers and sisters, Pedro Joaquín, Dionisio, Carmen, Mercedes and Fernando grew under his guardianship.\n\nFruto's father was one of the founders of the Conservative Party of Nicaragua, centered on the city of Granada. He was committed to the Conservative cause and became an activist of the Party. In 1836, he became a representative in the State Assembly. From 1839 to 1842, he was a Senator of the State of Nicaragua.\n\nIn 1842, an attempt was made to reestablish a union of Central American states as the Central American Confederation, in accord with the \"Pact of Chinandega\". It was to include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In 1843, Fruto Chamorro was appointed Supreme Director of the Confederation junta, and he took up residence in San Miguel, El Salvador. However, Guatemala withdrew, and Fruto was instrumental in preventing a war over the decision. The nascent Confederation collapsed in 1844.\n\nIn 1845, Fruto Chamorro was appointed Prefect and Military Governor of the Department of Granada, and Minister of the Treasury. In November 1851, during the administration of Supreme Director Laureano Pineda, he became Commander-in-chief of the Army.\n\nFruto Chamorro himself became Supreme Director of Nicaragua on 1 April 1853. Almost immediately and with support of the conservative oligarchy, he transferred the government headquarters to Granada, the Conservative stronghold. He then convened a Constituent Assembly on 20 January 1854, to promulgate a new Constitution during the absence of the majority of the western (Liberal Party) representatives, virtually expelled from the country by the government's move to Granada. In March, Fruto Chamorro relinquished his title as Supreme Director and with acquiescence of the Assembly, named himself President of Nicaragua.\n\nThe Liberals saw this as a restoration to power of the provincial oligarchy, continuation of a feudal economic system, and the diminished possibility of an alliance of all Central American reactionary forces as well. \nThey initiated a civil war by establishing their own government in León in May 1854, with the support of the governments of Honduras and El Salvador. A force under the command of General Máximo Jerez was sent to besiege Granada. \nIn preparation for the siege, President Chamorro placed himself at the headquarters of the Army and left executive authority with his deputy, José María Estrada. His defenses for Granada were successful and subsequent attacks failed to take the city.\n\nA victim of dysentery, Fruto Chamorro died at his hacienda outside Granada on 12 March 1855.

After studying practical agriculture with George Butler (the father of the writer Hubert Butler) at Maiden Hall in Bennetsbridge, County Kilkenny, Ireland, he joined the Colonial Service in 1936.\n\nAfter arriving at Banaba Island on 21 September 1937, Gallagher received additional training before being appointed deputy commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony on 3 June 1938. Sent to Tuvalu to learn Tuvaluan he became popular with the residents, who wanted him to stay. Nevertheless, after a bout with tropical ulcers he was assigned to the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme, as second-in-command to Harry Maude. In December 1938 they sailed with the first Gilbertese colonists to Manra in the Phoenix Islands, where Gallagher remained to supervise development of that island. When Maude fell ill in late 1939 and was assigned to Pitcairn Island, Gallagher was appointed officer in charge of the three atolls selected for development. He was assisted by Jack Kimo Petro, later characterized by archaeologist and historian Tom King as \"a half-Tuvaluan/half Portuguese engineer and artisan of considerable skill and energy.\"\n\nGallagher's supervising role in the colony's local government was shared with leaders chosen from among the colonists. The young British official skillfully settled an early, hotly disputed debate among them by suggesting that instead of using the traditional Gilbertese boti system, each household be given a place in the maneaba, or local meeting house. The Phoenix Islands maneaba was subsequently named \"tabuki ni Karaka\", or \"Gallagher's accomplishment\".\n\nBy late 1940 there were roughly 672 settlers on Manra and Orona, with coconuts being harvested and processed into copra. On Nikumaroro an area on the southwest side of the island had been cleared and planted, a 20,000 gallon water cistern had been installed and water wells were finally productive. Gallagher, who by now had been affectionately nicknamed \"Irish\" by some of the settlers, chose Nikumaroro as the colony's government centre and moved there in late September 1940.\n\nGallagher wished to establish Gardner Island, (later renamed Nikumaroro) as \"the model island of the Phoenix.\" Although the gathering war interfered with shipping Gallagher and the settlers were persistent, starting work on the government station and an official rest house by manually clearing away many rocks and tree roots. The end of 1940 saw severe north-westerly gales which damaged newly built houses, coconut plantings and other facilities.\n\nThe government station was later called \"Karaka\", after Gallagher. It featured a large, expertly levelled parade ground with a crushed white coral surface and flanked on three sides by wide roads with coral slab curbs. At the eastern side two buildings were constructed on concrete platforms with others along the north and west, including a school, village carpenter's shop, boat house, concrete dispensary and a wireless station nearby to the north (with line of sight to Ocean Island). The village was to the south, with typical homes made up of sleeping quarters and a cookhouse under thatched roofs, sometimes raised on coral blocks.\n\nThe most memorable building is said to have been the rest house, with its sweeping thatched roof and wide veranda, complete with a modern RCA console radio in a wooden cabinet (powered by large batteries). This was both Gallagher's residence and quarters for visiting officials along with other invited guests.\n\nBy early 1941 the Battle of Britain had distracted London's attention far from the tiny colony. Shipping was a constant challenge and Gallagher, now certified as fluent in the colonists' \"I Kiribati\" language, travelled on the few available ships, working day and night, personally loading and unloading supplies along with distributing coast-watching personnel and equipment throughout the colony, often in secret.\n\nOn 20 September 1941, Sir Harry Luke, High Commissioner of the western Pacific, sent Gallagher a coded telegram with word he was about to be promoted as secretary to government and reposted to Ocean Island, but Gallagher didn't reply to the polite query asking for his thoughts on this. That day he had fallen seriously ill at sea with tropical sprue, an infection sometimes aggravated by poor nutrition which interferes with the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients, resulting in symptoms related to malnutrition.\n\nHe arrived at Nikumaroro on the 24th. Gallagher's first night back on the atoll and in the rest house seemed to bring an improvement. However, according to a witness, when Gallagher learned of his promotion the news put him at \"the end of his tether.\" He had come to consider the Gilbertese colonists his own native people. Meanwhile, with Gallagher's permission a British doctor opened his abdomen and was shocked by the advanced state of damage he found. Gallagher's condition deteriorated rapidly and he died on 27 September 1941, at the age of 29\n\nNikumaroro, Manra and Orona were evacuated by Her Majesty's Government in 1963. At his mother's request, Gallagher's remains were moved to Tarawa for reburial and the memorial plaque was retrieved. Although reasons cited for giving up on the struggling colony included unstable water lenses and uncertain copra markets, observers familiar with the colony's history remarked that after Gallagher's death a \"will\" or \"nerve\" to succeed seemed to vanish from the settlements. In 2001 an American archaeological team put a replica of the plaque on his grave, quite unaware it had been empty for 38 years. They were on the island because during the height of the Battle of Britain in October 1940, Gallagher, a licensed pilot, had radioed his superiors in Fiji to inform them he believed a work party of Gilbertese colonists on Nikumaroro had found a sextant box along with the skeletal remains possibly belonging to Amelia Earhart, an aviator who disappeared in 1937.\n\nIn 2007 Gallagher's long-empty 1941 grave was still visible in the overgrown ruins of the colonial government station on Nikumaroro.\n\n\n"}

Literary agents most often represent novelists, screenwriters, and non-fiction writers. They are paid a fixed percentage (usually twenty percent on foreign sales and ten to fifteen percent for domestic sales) of the proceeds of sales they negotiate on behalf of their clients.\n\nLiterary agents perform various services for authors. They connect the author's work with appropriate publishers, negotiate contracts, ensure royalty payments, and mediate problems between author and publisher. Agents can help new authors get public recognition. Agents also help publishing houses and others expedite the process of review, publication, and distribution of authors' works. Many well-known, powerful, and lucrative publishing houses (such as the Big Five) are generally less open than smaller publishers to unrepresented submissions. A knowledgeable agent knows the market, and can be a source of valuable career advice and guidance. Being a publishable author doesn't automatically make someone an expert on modern publishing contracts and practices—especially where television, film, or foreign rights are involved. Many authors prefer to have an agent handle such matters. This prevents straining the author's working relationship with the editor with disputes about royalty statements or late checks. \n\nAn agent can also function as an adviser, showing an author the various aspects of how to make a living writing. Literary agents often transition from jobs in other aspects of the publishing industry. Though self-publishing is becoming much more popular, literary agents still fulfill a useful role as gatekeepers to publishing houses.\n\nLiterary agencies can range in size from a single agent who represents perhaps a dozen authors, to a substantial firm with senior partners, sub-agents, specialists in areas like foreign rights or licensed merchandise tie-ins, and clients numbering in the hundreds. Most agencies, especially smaller ones, specialize to some degree. They may represent—for example—authors of science fiction, mainstream thrillers and mysteries, children's books, romance, or highly topical nonfiction. Very few agents represent short stories or poetry.\n\nLegitimate agents and agencies in the book world are not required to be members of the Association of Authors' Representatives (AAR), but according to \"Writer's Market\" listings, many agents in the United States are. To qualify for AAR membership, agents must have sold a minimum number of books and pledge to abide by a Canon of Ethics. Effective professional agents often learn their trade while working for another agent, though some cross over to agenting after working as editors.\n\nLegitimate agents do not charge reading or other upfront fees (e.g., retainers), or bill authors for most operating expenses. They also do not offer to place work with a vanity or subsidy press.\n\nA client typically establishes a relationship with an agent through \"querying\", though the two may meet at a writers' conference, through a contest, or in other ways. A query is an unsolicited proposal for representation, either for a finished work or unfinished work. Various agents request different elements in a query packet, and most agencies list their specific submission requirement on their Website or in their listing in major directories. It typically begins with the author sending a query letter (1-2 pages) that explains the purpose of the work and any writing qualifications of the author. Some agencies want a synopsis or outline as part of the query. Often, the author sends the first three chapters (typically around 50 pages) of their work. For paper queries, the author must include a self-addressed stamped envelope to receive a response, though email submissions are increasingly common.\n\nIf an agency rejects a written query, they send the response—typically a form letter—in the self-addressed stamped envelope. A rejection that is not merely a form letter, or has hand-written comments (especially a message to the effect of \"query me for other projects\") is typically a good sign.\n\nThe first literary agents appeared around the year 1880 (Publishing).\n\n\n\n"}

The location for the \"Hortus Botanicus\"--part of the farm of S. Bento's College in the Ursulinas Valley--was chosen by the vice-chancellor of the University of Coimbra (Francisco de Lemos). Domingos Vandelli was the first supervisor for the orientation of the garden, followed in 1791 by Félix Avelar Brotero, professor of Botany and Agriculture. \n\nThe garden, considered one of the most beautiful of Europe, occupies 13 hectares and can be divided in two parts.\n\n\"The first part\", located at the top of the valley, constitutes the most formal area and it is divided in terraces. The lower terrace, known as the Quadrado Central (The Central Square), is the most primitive part of the garden and is decorated like European gardens of the 18th century. In this terrace, adorned with a fountain from the 1940s, some trees planted during the time of Brotero can still be seen, such as: \"Cryptomeria japonica\", \"Cunninghamia sinensis\" and \"Erythrina crista-galli\". On the other terraces are:\n\na) The Order Beds, where plants, taxonomically grouped, are cultivated for the use of botany students and for exchange with similar institutions all over the world (Index Seminum et Sporarum). \n\nb) The Greenhouses, where tropical and sub-tropical plants develop under different conditions of temperature and humidity, according to their various needs, among which Victoria cruziana is one of the best known and admired.\n\n\"The second part\" of the garden, including the valley where once a small stream flowed, is the arboretum, usually known as \"Mata\" of the Botanical Garden. The arboretum includes the Monocotyledoneae collection, a splendid bamboo forest and dense vegetation with exotic trees, a collection of 51 species of \"Eucalyptus\", and a notable specimen of \"Ficus macrophylla\".\n\nThe Department of Botany of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra (\"Instituto Botânico Dr. Júlio Henriques\"), of which the garden is a component, includes the library, the herbarium, the museum and the laboratories dating from the period of Prof. Júlio Henriques' direction (end of 19th century). Botany classes were first held at the natural history museum; they were later transferred, by Avelar Brotero's initiative, to a house built in the garden for that purpose but later demolished.\n\nThe Botanical Garden shelters several species of birds in their natural environment. The brown squirrel (\"Sciurus vulgaris\") has been part of the ecosystem since it was introduced in June 1994. The six couples of squirrels which were the initial population have adapted and bred successfully and are now an integral part of the environment.\n\n"}

Features of this agreement became models for the thousands of such agreements that were to follow, although in recent decades some of the traditional clauses in such agreements have been modified (or \"liberalized\") in accordance with \"open skies\" policies adopted by some governments, notably the United States.\n\nIn principle all ATAs should be registered by the International Civil Aviation Organization in DAGMAR, the ICAO's Database of Aeronautical Agreements and Arrangements, but this source is not absolutely comprehensive.\n\nAir service agreements (ASA) are formal treaties between countries – accompanying memoranda of understanding (MoU) and exchanges of formal diplomatic notes.

Feist, and later in a collection called \"Legends\". \n\nThe story established a basis for various elements of the novel \"A Hat Full of Sky\", but is not required to understand that novel.\n\nA coalition of witches, led by self-appointed organiser Lettice Earwig, asks Granny Weatherwax not to participate in the annual Lancre Witch Trials, on account of her always winning. She agrees, becoming disconcertingly nice. \n\nIt is revealed in later stories, most specifically the Tiffany Aching series, that this is because Granny has made it clear that she does not approve of Lettice Earwig's methods, and admitting that a rival is correct \"\"at the time of her own choosing\"\" is the greatest and most calculated insult Granny can possibly deliver to another witch, essentially having agreed with Lettice Earwig's own unwitting 'admission' that she cannot beat Granny.\n\nThe title has confused people; Pratchett has since explained that Granny is the sea, and the other witches are the fishes (at one point Nanny says that calling Granny 'full of pride' is like calling the sea 'full of water'; water is what the sea \"is\").\n\nIt is based on the \"ancient phrase\" \"The big sea does not care which way the little fishes swim\", which Pratchett made up at some point before the story, and finally used in \"Night Watch\".\n\n\n The witches appear as supporting characters in the Tiffany Aching stories starting with \"The Wee Free Men\". \"A Hat Full of Sky\" further develops the Witch Trials and the character of Mrs. Earwig.\n"}

Benda\n\nWładysław Teodor \"W.T.\" Benda (January 15, 1873, Poznań, Poland (Posen, German Empire) – November 30, 1948, Newark, New Jersey, United States) was a Polish painter, illustrator, and designer.\n\nThe son of musician Jan Szymon Benda, and a nephew of the actress Helena Modrzejewska (known in the United States as Helena Modjeska), W.T. Benda studied art at the Kraków College of Technology and Art in his native Poland and at the School of Fine Arts in Vienna, Austria. He came to the United States in 1899, to visit his Aunt Helena, who then lived in California. He stayed, and moved to New York City in 1902, where he attended the Art Students League of New York and the William Merritt Chase School. While there, Benda studied under Robert Henri and Edward Penfield.\n\nHe joined the Society of Illustrators in 1907, the Architectural League in 1916, and became a naturalized American in 1911. He was also a member of the National Society of Mural Painters.\n\nHe remained in NYC for the rest of his life. Benda married Romola Campfield, and they had two daughters, Eleonora and Basia, who were both artists.\n\nStarting in 1905, Benda was primarily a graphic artist. He illustrated books, short stories, advertising copy, and magazine covers for \"Collier's\", \"McCall's\", \"Ladies' Home Journal\", \"Good Housekeeping\", \"Theatre Magazine\" and many others. Many publishers regarded Benda as their go-to artist for his dependability and artistic abilities. In his time he was as well known as Norman Rockwell, N.C. Wyeth or Maxfield Parrish. During the 1920s/1930s every publication sought the look of \"the American Girl\", but Benda's beautiful women were often exotic and mysterious, not homespun pretty like the girls of Harrison Fisher or Howard Chandler Christy. Benda was fiercely proud of his Polish heritage and became closely associated with the Polish-American cultural institution, The Kosciuszko Foundation (see below). During the two World Wars, he designed many posters for both Poland and America. Many of these posters advocated for relief efforts. He was honored with the ‘Polonia Restituta’ decoration by the Polish government following World War I.\n\nBeginning in 1914, Benda was also an accomplished mask maker and costume designer. His sculpted, papier-mâché face masks were used in plays and dances and often in his own paintings and illustrations. They were used in masques or miracle plays in New York City at venues like the New York Coffee House. Benda also created the masks for stage productions in New York and London for such writers as Eugene O'Neill and Noël Coward. He became so well known as a mask maker that his name became synonymous for any lifelike mask, whether it was of his design or not. Benda also created \"grotesque\" masks, which were more fantasy or caricature in nature. Benda created the original mask design for the movie \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\", which was originally published as a twelve part serial in \"Collier's\" from May 7, 1932 through July 23, 1932. The cover of the May 7 issue presented a stunning portrait by Benda. In the latter stages of his career, Benda spent less time doing illustration and more time making masks.\n\nArticles by and about Benda and his masks appeared regularly in many of the same magazines and publications that carried his illustrations. In the 1930s, he authored the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" entry on masks. He also wrote a book, \"Masks\", a study of his own designs and unique construction techniques.\n\nThe Polish Museum of America and the Pritzker Military Museum & Library possess collections of Benda's posters for the relief effort in Poland.\n\n\n"}

Similar programs exist for immediate care providers such as paramedics. The program has been adopted worldwide in over 60 countries, sometimes under the name of Early Management of Severe Trauma, especially outside North America. Its goal is to teach a simplified and standardized approach to trauma patients. Originally designed for emergency situations where only one doctor and one nurse are present, ATLS is now widely accepted as the standard of care for initial assessment and treatment in trauma centers. The premise of the ATLS program is to treat the greatest threat to life first. It also advocates that the lack of a definitive diagnosis and a detailed history should not slow the application of indicated treatment for life-threatening injury, with the most time-critical interventions performed early. However, there is no high-quality evidence to show that ATLS improves patient outcomes as it has not been studied.\n\nThe first and key part of the assessment of patients presenting with trauma is called the primary survey. During this time, life-threatening injuries are identified and simultaneously resuscitation is begun. A simple mnemonic, ABCDE, is used as a mnemonic for the order in which problems should be addressed.\n\nThe first stage of the primary survey is to assess the airway. If the patient is able to talk, the airway is likely to be clear. If the patient is unconscious, he/she may not be able to maintain his/her own airway. The airway can be opened using a chin lift or jaw thrust. Airway adjuncts may be required. If the airway is blocked (e.g., by blood or vomit), the fluid must be cleaned out of the patient's mouth by the help of suctioning instruments. In case of obstruction, pass an endotracheal tube.\n\nThe chest must be examined by inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Subcutaneous emphysema and tracheal deviation must be identified if present. The aim is to identify and manage six life-threatening thoracic conditions as Airway Obstruction, Tension Pneumothorax, Massive Haemothorax, Open Pneumothorax, Flail chest segment with Pulmonary Contusion and Cardiac Tamponade. Flail chest, tracheal deviation, penetrating injuries and bruising can be recognized by inspection. Subcutaneous emphysema can be recognized by palpation. Tension Pneumothorax and Haemothorax can be recognized by percussion and auscultation.\n\nHemorrhage is the predominant cause of preventable post-injury deaths. Hypovolemic shock is caused by significant blood loss. Two large-bore intravenous lines are established and crystalloid solution may be given. If the person does not respond to this, type-specific blood, or O-negative if this is not available, should be given. External bleeding is controlled by direct pressure. Occult blood loss may be into the chest, abdomen, pelvis or from the long bones.\n\nAs of 2012, use of rFVIIa is not supported by evidence. While it may help control bleeding, there is a risk of arterial thrombosis, and other than in those with factor VII deficiency, its use should be limited to clinical trials.\n\nDuring the primary survey a basic neurological assessment is made, known by the mnemonic AVPU (alert, verbal stimuli response, painful stimuli response, or unresponsive). A more detailed and rapid neurological evaluation is performed at the end of the primary survey. This establishes the patient's level of consciousness, pupil size and reaction, lateralizing signs, and spinal cord injury level.\n\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale is a quick method to determine the level of consciousness, and is predictive of patient outcome. If not done in the primary survey, it should be performed as part of the more detailed neurologic examination in the secondary survey. An altered level of consciousness indicates the need for immediate reevaluation of the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and perfusion status. Hypoglycemia and drugs, including alcohol, may influence the level of consciousness. If these are excluded, changes in the level of consciousness should be considered to be due to traumatic brain injury until proven otherwise.\n\nThe patient should be completely undressed, usually by cutting off the garments. It is imperative to cover the patient with warm blankets to prevent hypothermia in the emergency department. Intravenous fluids should be warmed and a warm environment maintained. Patient privacy should be maintained.\n\nWhen the primary survey is completed, resuscitation efforts are well established, and the vital signs are normalizing, the secondary survey can begin. The secondary survey is a head-to-toe evaluation of the trauma patient, including a complete history and physical examination, including the reassessment of all vital signs. Each region of the body must be fully examined. X-rays indicated by examination are obtained. If at any time during the secondary survey the patient deteriorates, another primary survey is carried out as a potential life threat may be present. The person should be removed from the hard spine board and placed on a firm mattress as soon as reasonably feasible as the spine board can rapidly cause skin breakdown and pain while a firm mattress provides equivalent stability for potential spinal fractures.\n\nA careful and complete examination followed by serial assessments help recognize missed injuries and related problems, allowing a definitive care management. The rate of delayed diagnosis may be as high as 10%.\n\nMannequin surgical simulators are widely used in the United States as alternatives to the use of live animals in ATLS courses. In 2014, PETA announced that it was donating surgical simulators to ATLS training centers in 9 countries that agreed to switch from animal use to training on the simulators.\n\nAdditionally, Anaesthesia Trauma and Critical Care (ATACC) is an international trauma course based in the United Kingdom that teaches an advanced trauma course and represents the next level for trauma care and trauma patient management post ATLS certification. Accredited by two Royal Colleges and numerous emergency services, the course runs numerous times per year for candidates drawn from all areas of medicine and trauma care. Specific injuries, such as major burn injury, may be better managed by other more programs.\n\nIn military medicine, the ATLS protocol has been modified to the BATLS protocol. The treatment procedure is cABCDE. Added c = Catastrophic bleeding (massive external bleeding).\n\nATLS has its origins in the United States in 1976, when James K. Styner, an orthopedic surgeon piloting a light aircraft, crashed his plane into a field in Nebraska. His wife Charlene was killed instantly and three of his four children, Richard, Randy, and Kim sustained critical injuries. His son Chris suffered a broken arm. He carried out the initial triage of his children at the crash site. Dr. Styner had to flag down a car to transport him to the nearest hospital; upon arrival, he found it closed. Even once the hospital was opened and a doctor called in, he found that the emergency care provided at the small regional hospital where they were treated was inadequate and inappropriate. Upon returning to Lincoln, Dr. Styner declared: \"When I can provide better care in the field with limited resources than what my children and I received at the primary care facility, there is something wrong with the system and the system has to be changed”\n\nUpon returning to work, he set about developing a system for saving lives in medical trauma situations. Styner and his colleague Paul 'Skip' Collicott, with assistance from advanced cardiac life support personnel and the Lincoln Medical Education Foundation, produced the initial ATLS course which was held in 1978. In 1980, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma adopted ATLS and began US and international dissemination of the course. Styner himself recently recertified as an ATLS instructor, teaching his Instructor Candidate course in Nottingham in the UK, July 2007, and then in the Netherlands.\n\nSince its inception, ATLS has become the standard for trauma care in American emergency departments and advanced paramedical services. Since emergency physicians, paramedics and other advanced practitioners use ATLS as their model for trauma care it makes sense that programs for other providers caring for trauma would be designed to interface well with ATLS. The Society of Trauma Nurses has developed the Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses (ATCN) course for registered nurses. ATCN meets concurrently with ATLS and shares some of the lecture portions. This approach allows for medical and nursing care to be well coordinated with one another as both the medical and nursing care providers have been trained in essentially the same model of care. Similarly, the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians has developed the Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) course for basic Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT)s and a more advanced level class for Paramedics. The International Trauma Life Support committee publishes the ITLS-Basic and ITLS-Advanced courses for prehospital professionals as well. This course is based around ATLS and allows the PHTLS-trained EMTs to work alongside paramedics and to transition smoothly into the care provided by the ATLS and ATCN-trained providers in the hospital. On March 22, 2013 the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma renamed their annual Award for Meritorious Service in ATLS to the James K. Styner Award for Meritorious Service in honor of Dr. Styner's contributions to trauma care.\n\n\n"}

The route runs from U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in St. Albans in the west to the New Hampshire state line in Bloomfield in the east. The road continues across the state line as Bridge Street, a short unnumbered New Hampshire state route to US 3 in North Stratford, New Hampshire. As it is not a New Hampshire state highway, the connection is signed with Vermont state highway signage, similar to how connections to Vermont state routes are indicated elsewhere in New Hampshire.\n\nMoose are most often encountered on four roads in Vermont, of which this is one. They are seen from Island Pond to Bloomfield.\n\nVT 105 begins at a fork from US 7 (Swanton Road) in the Franklin County city of St. Albans. VT 105 runs northeast along Sheldon Road, a two-lane road paralleling nearby railroad tracks. The route turns east and merges into Seymour Road, which changes names to Sheldon. Running along the northern side of St. Albans, becoming a two-lane rural road in the town of St. Albans. After a straight stretch of eastbound roadway, VT 105 crosses under, but does not intersect with Interstate 89. Now running northeast, VT 105 reaches a junction with the northern terminus of VT 104 (Fisher Pond Road).\n\nAt this junction, VT 105 turns further to the northeast, retaining the Sheldon Road moniker as it crosses through rural St. Albans. Entering the town of Swanton, the route remains rural, crossing railroad tracks. The route soon crosses into the rural hamlet of Greens Corners, crossing into the town of Sheldon. At the junction with Bedard Road, VT 105 enters a small residential area in town, running north to the intersection with Woods Hill Road. At Woods Hill Road, VT 105 turns northeast again, crossing through woods and fields in Sheldon. VT 105 turns eastward, then bends southeast into the hamlet of Sheldon Springs.\n\nCrossing through Sheldon Springs, VT 105 crosses railroad tracks, paralleling with nearby Mill Street, which merges back in. The route runs southeast out of Sheldon Springs, paralleling the tracks, and crossing Missisquoi River. VT 105 reaches the hamlet of Sheldon Junction and an intersection with the eastern end of VT 78. Crossing through Sheldon Junction, the route makes a curve to the northeast again, paralleling the Missisquoi River. VT 105 becomes a rural roadway again, continuing near the river into a junction with VT 120 (Kane Road). VT 105 continues northeast along the riverside before beginning an eastbound wind through Sheldon. Passing an intersection with VT 236 (State Park Road).\n\nVT 105 soon crosses into Enosburg Falls runs southeast into the village, being main west–east road through the community. Soon, the route meets a junction with VT 108 (Main Street), which becomes concurrent at the junction with VT 105 turning northeast along Main Street. Now the main north–south road through Enosburg Falls, passing commercial roads through the city. VT 108 and VT 105 continue northeast until the junction with West Berkshire Road, where VT 108 turns off to the northwest and VT 105 turns northeast on Sampsonville Road. VT 105 soon leaves Enosburg Falls, entering the town of Enosburg.\n\nRetaining the name Sampsonville Road, VT 105 winds east along the river, reaching the hamlet of Sampsonville. Changing names to East Berkshire Road, crossing into the town of Berkshire and junction with VT 118 (Berkshire Center Road). VT 118 and VT 105 are concurrent for a short stretch, reaching Montgomery Road, where VT 118 turns off. The route bends north as East Berkshire Road, continuing through the town of Berkshire. Continuing along the riverside, VT 105 soon enters the town of Richford, where it is a two-lane residential street. At the junction with Troy Street, VT 139 begins as Main Street, while VT 105 turns off on Troy.\n\nVT 105 runs southeast through Richford, paralleling the riverside out of the hamlet as Jay Road. Fast approaching the Canada–United States border, the route turns northeast and into a junction with VT 105A (Glen-Sutton Road). VT 105A runs northeast to border while VT 105 runs through dense woods in Richford. Making a huge curve to the southeast, the route parallels the border, crossing into Orleans County. Now in the town of Troy, the route bends southeast and then makes a curve to the northeast, along some mountainsides in town. The dense woods start to break up as VT 105 reaches a junction with VT 101.\n\nVT 101 ends at the junction as VT 105 takes over the right-of-way, running north into village of North Troy. In North Troy, VT 105 turns eastward along North Pleasant Street after a junction with VT 243, which runs to the Quebec border and Route 243. Running along North Pleasant, VT 105 crosses the east branch of the Missisquoi River, changing names to East Main, and turning southeast along a parallel of nearby railroad tracks. The tracks soon divert to the northeast as VT 105 returns to the town of Troy, running southeast through the rural town and turning east once again.\n\nAfter crossing the railroad tracks again, VT 105 crosses into the town of Newport, paralleling a nearby creek. The route enters the hamlet of Newport, where it is the main northwest–southeast street through the community as a two-lane residential road. VT 105 soon leaves the hamlet, remaining in the town of Newport. Continuing southeast, the route reaches the northern terminus of VT 100, which trades its right-of-way to VT 105, running northeast. The route bends east, crossing into the town of Coventry. North of Walker Pond, the route bends northeast and turns east into the city of Newport.\n\nNow named Highland Avenue, VT 105 runs eastward along the hills around Newport, reaching a junction with US 5 (Pleasant Street). VT 105 and US 5 become concurrent along Pleasant Street, becoming the main street in the city. A block later, the route turns north on Third Street, heading toward Lake Memphremagog. Two blocks north of Pleasant Street, it turns east onto Main Street, paralleling the shoreline of the lake. At Railroad Square, VT 105 and US 5 turn north and crosses the lake. On the other side of the lake, the route parallels the Clyde River, reaching a junction with the western terminus of VT 191.\n\nNow known as Union Street, VT 105 and US 5 turn east onto East Main Street, paralleling north of VT 191. After the junction with Western Avenue, the route continues along East Main, passing north of Clyde Pond. Now in the town of Derby, it turns northeast and away from VT 191, entering an interchange with I-91 (exit 28). VT 105 and US 5 enter Derby Center as the main west–east street. At the eastern end of the community VT 105 turns south on the same right-of-way. At this junction, VT 5A becomes concurrent with VT 105, which south through the southern edges of Derby Center, intersecting with the western end of VT 111.\n\nVT 105 and VT 5A run southeast out of Derby Center and into the town of Derby, paralleling Lake Salem, which soon becomes another portion of the Clyde River. VT 105 and VT 5A continue along the Clyde, crossing into the town of Charleston. Now known as East Charleston Road, bending eastward into the hamlet of West Charleston. The route bends southward past Charleston Pond, where VT 5A forks to the southwest. Paralleling the Clyde River, reaching Pensioner Pond, which is surrounded by both routes on each shore, VT 105 turns further to the southeast, passing through the hamlet of East Charleston.\n\nCrossing the Pherrins River, VT 105 crosses into Essex County and the town of Brighton. Paralleling the Pherrins River, VT 105 continues southeast into a junction with VT 114 (East Haven Road). VT 105 and VT 114 run northeast through Brighton, reaching the hamlet of Island Pond. Now known as Derby Street, the routes reach the namesake pond, turning north onto Cross Street. One block north on Cross, VT  VT 105 turns east onto East Brighton Road. Paralleling railroad tracks and Island Pond, VT 105 runs southeast, leaving Island Pond hamlet for Brighton State Park.\n\nThe route continues southeast through woods, passing the John H. Boylan State Airport as it turns eastward, passing Nulhegan Pond. Now paralleling the Nulhegan River, VT 105 enters the town of Ferdinand, crossing through the hamlet of East Brighton. Continuing along the railroad tracks, VT 105 makes a long bend southeast and turns northeast again up a mountainside. Running along a mountainside, the route runs east paralleling the Nulhegan River, making a large bend southward into the town of Brunswick and soon into the village of Bloomfield. In Bloomfield, VT 105 runs northwest–southeast, crossing a junction with VT 102. After VT 102, VT 105 crosses the Connecticut River and enters the state of New Hampshire, marking the eastern end of VT 105. After the bridge, Bridge Street runs east for two blocks to a junction with US 3.\n\nVermont Route 105A is a long north–south state highway, entirely within Richford, Vermont. Its southern terminus VT 105. It runs parallel with the Missisquoi River to the Canadian border, terminating at the East Richford–Glen Sutton Border Crossing and the Missisquoi River Bridge.\n"}
{"id": "2229030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229030", "title": "AirTouch", "text": "AirTouch\n\nAirTouch Communications was a U.S.-based wireless telephone service provider, created as a spin-off on Pacific Telesis on April 1, 1994. Its headquarters were in One California in the Financial District, San Francisco, California. After a series of mergers, the company's vestiges are now part of Verizon Wireless.\n\nAt the time of the Bell System divestiture in 1984, each Regional Bell Operating Company (Baby Bell) was given a portion of the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) network corresponding to its service area. Pacific Telesis, the Baby Bell covering California and Nevada, spun off its wireless services as AirTouch Communications in 1994.\n\nU S West's U S West New Vector was also created from AMPS. In July 1994, U S West agreed to a joint venture with AirTouch as a prelude to merging the cellular unit into AirTouch. By 1996, all accounts were operated under the AirTouch name. Due to regulatory issues, the full merger was not completed until February 1998. As part of the merger, certain overlapping areas of coverage had to be sold to other wireless providers. Many of these went to GTE Wireless.\n\nOn June 30, 1999, AirTouch Communications merged with UK-based Vodafone Group Plc, becoming Vodafone AirTouch Plc, after rejecting overtures from Bell Atlantic Corporation. In September 1999, Vodafone AirTouch announced a $70-billion joint venture with Bell Atlantic to be called Verizon Wireless, which would be composed of the two companies' U.S. wireless assets, Bell Atlantic Mobile (another AMPS spinoff) and AirTouch Cellular. This wireless joint venture received regulatory approval in six months, and began operations as Verizon Wireless on April 4, 2000. On June 30, 2000, the addition of GTE Wireless' assets, in connection with the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE to form Verizon Communications, made Verizon Wireless the nation's largest wireless communications provider. For the joint venture, Verizon Communications owns 55% and Vodafone owns 45%. In 2014, Verizon Communications purchased the 45% owned by Vodafone. AirTouch Paging was re-branded as Verizon Wireless Messaging Services. In June, 2006, Verizon Wireless sold the paging division to American Messaging Services, effectively ending Verizon Wireless Messaging Services.\n\nVerizon Wireless still maintains a call center in some of the buildings that used to house AirTouch Cellular's call center and administrative offices.\n\nIn 1994, AirTouch was considered by some to be an innovative company in its approach to employee management. It invested in its employees in incentives, training, opportunities, and innovation. They focused on Total Quality Management (TQM) which encouraged all employees to submit process improvement ideas annually following the Quality Blue Print Advantage. Notable were Benjamin Franklin ($100 bill) distributions with customer growth milestones from the GM/VP's desk without it being taxable and Right Things Right (internal employee recognition program).\n\nFormer employees often plan reunions to reminisce fondly about their experiences with the company.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2229036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229036", "title": "Carvel (franchise)", "text": "Carvel (franchise)\n\nCarvel is an American ice cream franchise owned by Focus Brands. Carvel is best known for its soft-serve ice cream and ice cream cakes, which feature a layer of distinctive 'crunchies'. It also sells a variety of novelty ice cream bars and ice cream sandwiches.\n\nCarvel operates a chain of more than 500 franchised ice cream outlets. It has locations in 25 states mostly in northeastern part, Puerto Rico, and some Middle Eastern countries, found in high-traffic areas such as airports, malls, and sports arenas. The company also sells ice cream cakes in more than 8,500 supermarkets.\n\nSince 2001, the corporation has been owned by Roark Capital Group and operated as part of Focus Brands. As of 2020, the Carvel corporate website reports \"more than 400 franchise and foodservice locations in more than 20 states and over 10 countries.\"\n\nCarvel popularized various novelty ice cream items, such as the \"Flying Saucer\", a circular ice cream sandwich, the \"Icy Wycy\", a paper cone of sherbet on a stick, \"Brown Bonnet\" and \"Cherry Bonnet,\" frozen vanilla ice cream on a sugar cone dipped in a sweet, waxy confection, the \"Tortoni\", a cup of vanilla ice cream covered with toasted coconut and topped with a maraschino cherry, and the \"Lollapalooza\", cylindrical ice cream on a stick covered with colored sprinkles, as well as the \"Mamapalooza\" and \"Papapalooza\".\n\nThe mainstays of Carvel's line of ice cream cakes were 7- to 12-inch rounds, 10 x 14 and 12 x 17-inch sheet cakes, and the \"Carvelog\", a log-shaped cake made in a cylindrical mold. In addition to Cookie Puss, Fudgie the Whale and Hug-Me the Bear, there were special cakes for most major holidays, including a \"Flower Basket\" for Mother's Day, \"Hoot The Owl\" for June graduations, \"Dumpy the Pumpkin\" and \"Wicky The Witch\" for Halloween, \"Tom the Turkey\" for Thanksgiving, \"Seamus The Leprechaun\" or \"Cookie O'Puss\" for St. Patrick's Day, and Santa Claus or a \"Snow Man\" for Christmas. Most of these were made from one of a limited number of molds; the Santa Claus cake had a two-pointed hat because the mold was ordinarily inverted and used the rest of the year to make Fudgie the Whale, who had a tail. Their primary differences from products available year-round were the designs on the icing.\n\nCarvel introduced the Lil' Love ice cream cake on March 30, 1998. The commercials, which first appeared in its introduction, show small children in special situations, such as losing a baby tooth, starring in a class play, getting an A in a school class, and getting new glasses (sung to the tune of \"Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay\"). A mother presents the new cake to celebrate. All ads carry the tag line \"Surprise someone special tonight.\"\n\nCarvel was founded and operated by Tom Carvel for its first 60 years. In 1929, Carvel borrowed $15 ($ today) from his future wife Agnes and used it to buy and operate an ice cream truck. Over Memorial Day weekend of 1934, Carvel's truck had a flat tire in Hartsdale, New York. Carvel sold his custard at the site of the breakdown. Within two days Carvel had sold his entire stock, much of it partly melted. He realized that a fixed location and soft (as opposed to hard) frozen desserts were good business ideas. In his first year, he grossed over $3,500. By 1937 he had a custard stand at the Hartsdale site, with a freezer which allowed him to make his own frozen custard. By 1939, gross was over $6,000.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Tom Carvel traveled, selling custard at carnivals, while his wife Agnes ran the Hartsdale location. During World War II he ran the ice cream stands at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, gaining expertise in refrigeration technology. He invented and patented a freezer, the \"Custard King\", and in 1947 sold 71 freezers at $2,900 each. Some freezer purchasers defaulted on payments on the units. Upon investigation, Carvel found that they were running their businesses inefficiently, choosing poor locations and not always maintaining high health standards. Carvel decided that the best course was to participate in running the operations of his freezer customers. He later claimed this led him to develop the concept of franchising.\n\nIn 1949, Carvel began franchising under the name \"Carvel Dari-Freez\". By the early 1950s, the company had over 50 stores. New franchisees undertook an 18-day training program at the \"Carvel College of Ice Cream Knowledge\", and were sent an in-house magazine called \"The Shopper's Road\". In addition Carvel provided building plans for franchises, which were initially stand-alone glass fronted stores.\n\nIn 1955, Tom Carvel began to record his own radio commercials. An unsubstantiated anecdote relates that he was driving in New York City, and heard a commercial for a new Carvel's store which did not mention the new store's location. Convinced he could do better, he drove to the radio station and did the next commercial himself. True or not, from 1955 onwards, Carvel recorded nearly all of the chain's advertising, eventually maintaining an in-house production studio at the headquarters offices, and becoming something of a regional celebrity.\n\nCarvel's commercials stood out and raised brand awareness primarily through their lack of sophistication. Carvel had a distinctive \"gravelly\" voice, lacking the \"slick\" sound of most professional voice-over artists, and all his narration was unrehearsed. His wording was conversational, with commercials frequently ending with the words \"Thank You\". Television commercials, aired primarily in the \"tri-state area\" of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, began in 1971. Accompanied by the familiar Tom Carvel narration, footage showed the products, and employees in the stores; very few graphics or effects were used.\n\nPromotions were part of Carvel's practices from their earliest days. In 1936, they had a \"Buy One Get One Free\" promotion, and in later years had various contests. They were an early adopter of corporate sponsorship of various events and tie-in promotions, including a tie-in with the New York Yankees. A long-running and well-known campaign was the \"Wednesday is Sundae at Carvel!\" discount.\n\nIn 1956, Carvel transformed the Hartsdale location into their first \"Ice Cream Supermarket\" by adding freezer cases containing pre-made cakes and novelty items which customers could choose and purchase. In 1955, Carvel began its \"lease back land offer\" program, in which a potential investor could buy land, build a franchise, then lease it back to the corporation.\n\nCarvel experimented with various ice cream vehicle options for most of its early history. Vehicle concepts included a scooter (circa 1957) and a custom truck, the \"Carvehicle\", for which they applied for several patents (circa 1958).\n\nA dispute with franchisees came to a head in 1962. Independent owners attempted to buy products from outside the corporate supply chain (in conflict with their contracts), maintaining that the company was deliberately overcharging them. Carvel argued that the franchisees were trying to use inferior ingredients. As well as the immediate impact on corporate cash flow, this hurt the corporate image, reducing the chain to 175 stores. When the corporation tried to enforce this contract, the Federal Trade Commission sued them for restraint of trade. Legal proceedings reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1964, with the corporation emerging victorious.\n\nIn 1967, the corporation bought the Westchester Town House Motel, on Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers, New York and renamed it the Carvel Inn, converting it for use as corporate headquarters, while still operating it as a hotel, providing them with a conference center for the annual franchisee conventions.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Carvel attempted to distinguish itself from other purveyors of soft-serve ice cream by claiming that its ice cream machines did not infuse the product with air, unlike the competition. During the 1970s, when dieting and fitness became more popular, Carvel began offering a low-fat frozen dessert called Thinny-Thin (\"Thinny-Thin, for your fatty-fat friends\"), and a frozen yogurt product called Lo-Yo. From 1973 to 1975, Carvel published a promotional comic book.\n\nIn 1983, Saturday Night Live parodied Carvel's ad campaigns during its season 9 episode 7 show, with Joe Piscopo portraying Tom Carvel becoming increasingly troubled by a franchisee's line of X-rated Christmas cakes shaped like breasts, buttocks, testicles and penises. The same year, the Beastie Boys released their first single, \"Cooky Puss\", which included audio of the rap band making prank phone calls to a Carvel store.\n\nBy 1985, there were 865 stores with an income of over $300 million.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Howard Stern used a vocal harmonizer to imitate the \"outer space\" voice of Cookie Puss that was used in Carvel's TV advertisements. Stern also made frequent references to longtime co-worker Fred Norris's cluelessness and cheapness in having once given his mother a Cookie Puss cake as a Mother's Day gift.\n\nIn 1989, an aging Tom Carvel sold the corporation to Investcorp for $80 million. In 1991, its headquarters was moved to Farmington, Connecticut. On December 11, 2001, Roark Capital Group, a private equity firm, purchased a controlling interest in Carvel Corporation from Investcorp. Investcorp became a minority share holder. \nCarvel was for most of its history a regional business, most strongly based on the east coast of the United States. As the business climate has changed, so has some of the focus of the brand. There are, as of 2018, approximately 418 retail franchises and food service locations, far fewer than at its peak. Carvel branded products are available in approximately 9,500 supermarkets. Celebration Foods has pushed the brand's presence from 30 states in 2004 to 49 in 2008, allowing them to form merchandising partnerships with national brands, such as ice cream cakes featuring Mars's M&M's characters. Focus Brands is based in Atlanta, Georgia, Celebration Foods is based in New Britain, Connecticut. \n\nIn August 2007, the current owner of the original Carvel location in Hartsdale revealed that he had applied for permission to knock down the store and develop a retail strip on the property. The Hartsdale store was closed on October 5, 2008. In March 2009, the store was demolished to make way for a Japanese restaurant. \n\nIn 2015, Carvel started to open co-branded stores with Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon.\n\n\n"}

In an FLM, each word is viewed as a vector of \"k\" factors: formula_1 An FLM provides the probabilistic model formula_2 where the prediction of a factor formula_3 is based on formula_4 parents formula_5. For example, if formula_6 represents a word token and formula_7 represents a Part of speech tag for English, the expression formula_8 gives a model for predicting current word token based on a traditional Ngram model as well as the Part of speech tag of the previous word.\n\nA major advantage of factored language models is that they allow users to specify linguistic knowledge such as the relationship between word tokens and Part of speech in English, or morphological information (stems, root, etc.) in Arabic.\n\nLike N-gram models, smoothing techniques are necessary in parameter estimation. In particular, generalized back-off is used in training an FLM.\n"}
{"id": "2229041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229041", "title": "N400 (neuroscience)", "text": "N400 (neuroscience)\n\nThe N400 is a component of time-locked EEG signals known as event-related potentials (ERP). It is a negative-going deflection that peaks around 400 milliseconds post-stimulus onset, although it can extend from 250-500 ms, and is typically maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites. The N400 is part of the normal brain response to words and other meaningful (or potentially meaningful) stimuli, including visual and auditory words, sign language signs, pictures, faces, environmental sounds, and smells.\n\nThe N400 was first discovered by Marta Kutas and Steven Hillyard in 1980. They conducted the first experiment looking at the response to unexpected words in read sentences, expecting to elicit a P300 component. The P300 had previously been shown to be elicited by unexpected stimuli. Kutas and Hillyard therefore used sentences with anomalous endings (i.e.\"I take coffee with cream and dog), expecting to see a P300 to the unexpected sentence-final words. However, instead of eliciting a large positivity, these anomalous endings elicited a large negativity, relative to the sentences with expected endings (i.e. \"He returned the book to the library) In the same paper, they confirmed that the negativity was not just caused by any unexpected event at the end of a sentence, since a semantically expected but physically unexpected word (i.e. \"She put on her high-heeled SHOES\") elicited a P300 instead of negativity in the N400 window. This finding showed that the N400 is related to semantic processing, and is not just a response to unexpected words.\n\nThe N400 is characterized by a distinct pattern of electrical activity that can be observed at the scalp. As its name indicates, this waveform peaks around 400 ms post-stimulus onset, with negativity that can be observed in the time window ranging from 250-500 ms. This latency (delay between stimulus and response) is very stable across tasks—little else besides age affects the timing of its peak. The N400 is a negative component, relative to reference electrodes placed on the mastoid processes (the bony ridge behind the ear), and relative to a 100 ms pre-stimulus baseline. Its amplitude can range from -5 to 5 microvolts. However, it is important to note that in studies using the N400 as a dependent measure, the relative amplitude of the waveform compared to another experimental condition (the \"N400 effect\") is more important than its absolute amplitude. The N400 itself is not always negative—it is just a more negative-going deflection than that seen to other conditions. Its distribution is maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites, and is slightly larger over the left side of the head for visual words, although the distribution can change slightly depending on the eliciting stimulus.\n\nA typical experiment designed to study the N400 will usually involve the visual presentation of words, either in sentence or list contexts. In a typical visual N400 experiment, for example, subjects will be seated in front of a computer monitor while words are presented one-by-one at a central screen location. Stimuli must be presented centrally because eye movements will generate large amounts of electrical noise that will mask the relatively small N400 component. Subjects will often be given a behavioral task (e.g., making a word/nonword decision, answering a comprehension question, responding to a memory probe), either after each stimulus or at longer intervals, to ensure that subjects are paying attention. Note, however, that overt responses by the subject are not required to elicit the N400—passively viewing stimuli will still evoke this response.\n\nAn example of an experimental task used to study the N400 is a priming paradigm. Subjects are shown a list of words in which a prime word is either associatively related to a target word (e.g. bee and honey), semantically related (e.g. sugar and honey) or a direct repetition (e.g. honey and honey). The N400 amplitude seen to the target word (honey) will be reduced upon repetition due to semantic priming. The amount of reduction in amplitude can be used to measure the degree of relatedness between the words.\n\nAnother widely used experimental task used to study the N400 is sentence reading. In this kind of study, sentences are presented to subjects centrally, one word at a time, until the sentence is completed. Alternatively, subjects could listen to a sentence as natural auditory speech. Again, subjects may be asked to respond to comprehension questions periodically throughout the experiment, although this is not necessary. Experimenters can choose to manipulate various linguistic characteristics of the sentences, including contextual constraint or the cloze probability of the sentence-final word (see below for a definition of cloze probability) to observe how these changes affect the waveform's amplitude.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the N400 response is seen to all meaningful, or potentially meaningful, stimuli. As such, a wide range of paradigms can be used to study it. Experiments involving the presentation of spoken words, acronyms, pictures embedded at the end of sentences, music, words related to current context or orientation and videos of real-word events, have all been used to study the N400, just to name a few.\n\nExtensive research has been carried out to better understand what kinds of experimental manipulations do and do not affect the N400. General findings are discussed below.\n\nThe frequency of a word's usage is known to affect the amplitude of the N400. With all else being constant, highly frequent words elicit reduced N400s relative to infrequent words. As previously mentioned, N400 amplitude is also reduced by repetition, such that a word's second presentation exhibits a more positive response when repeated in context. These findings suggest that when a word is highly frequent or has recently appeared in context, it eases the semantic processing thought to be indexed by the N400, reducing its amplitude.\n\nN400 amplitude is also sensitive to a word's orthographic neighborhood size, or how many other words differ from it by only one letter (e.g. \"boot\" and \"boat\"). Words with large neighborhoods (that have many other physically similar items) elicit larger N400 amplitudes than do words with small neighborhoods. This finding also holds true for pseudowords, or pronounceable letter strings that are not real words (e.g. flom), which are not themselves meaningful but look like words. This has been taken as evidence that the N400 reflects general activation in the comprehension network, such that items that look like many words (regardless of whether it itself is a word) partially activate the representations of similar-looking words, producing a more negative N400.\n\nThe N400 is sensitive to priming: in other words, its amplitude is reduced when a target word is preceded by a word that is semantically, morphologically, or orthographically related to it.\n\nIn a sentence context, an important determinant of N400 amplitude elicited by a word is its cloze probability. Cloze probability is defined as the probability of the target word completing that particular sentence frame. Kutas and Hillyard (1984) found that a word's N400 amplitude has a nearly inverse linear relationship with its cloze probability. That is, as a word becomes less expected in context, its N400 amplitude is increased relative to more expected words. Words that are incongruent with a context (and thus have a cloze probability of 0) elicit large N400 amplitudes as well (although the amplitude of the N400 for incongruent words is also modulated by the cloze probability of the congruent word that would have been expected in its place Relatedly, the N400 amplitude elicited by open-class words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) is reduced for words appearing later in a sentence compared to earlier words. Taken together, these findings suggest that when the prior context builds up meaning, it makes the processing of upcoming words that fit with that context easier, reducing the N400 amplitude they elicit.\n\nWhile the N400 is larger to unexpected items at the end of a sentence, its amplitude is generally unaffected by negation that causes the last word to be untrue and thus anomalous. For example, in the sentence \"A sparrow is a building, the N400 response to \"building\" is more negative than the N400 response to bird in the sentence \"A sparrow is a bird. In this case, building has a lower cloze probability, and so it is less expected than \"bird\". However, if negation is added to both sentences in the form of the word \"not\" (i.e. \"A sparrow is not a building and \"A sparrow is not a bird), the N400 amplitude to \"building\" will still be more negative than that seen to \"bird\". This suggests that the N400 responds to the relationship between words in context, but is not necessarily sensitive to the sentence's truth value. More recent research, however, has demonstrated that the N400 can sometimes be modulated by quantifiers or adjectives that serve negation-like purposes, or by pragmatically licensed negation.\n\nAdditionally, grammatical violations do not elicit a large N400 response. Rather, these types of violations show a large positivity from about 500-1000 ms after stimulus onset, known as the P600.\n\nA striking feature of the N400 is the general invariance of its peak latency. Although many different experimental manipulations affect the amplitude of the N400, few factors (aging and disease states and language proficiency being rare examples) alter the time it takes for the N400 component to reach a peak amplitude.\n\nAlthough localization of the neural generators of an ERP signal is difficult due to the spreading of current from the source to the sensors, multiple techniques can be used to provide converging evidence about possible neural sources. Using methods such as recordings directly off the surface of the brain or from electrodes implanted in the brain, evidence from brain damaged patients, and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings (which measure magnetic activity at the scalp associated with the electrical signal measured by ERPs), the left temporal lobe has been highlighted as an important source for the N400, with additional contributions from the right temporal lobe. More generally, however, activity in a wide network of brain areas is elicited in the N400 time window, suggesting a highly distributed neural source (See Kutas & Federmeier, 2011, for a more complete discussion).\n\nThere is still much debate as to exactly what kind of neural and comprehension processes the N400 indexes. Some researchers believe that the underlying processes reflected in the N400 occur after a stimulus has been recognized. For example, Brown and Hagoort (1993) believe that the N400 occurs late in the processing stream, and reflects the integration of a word's meaning into the preceding context (see Kutas & Federmeier, in press, for a discussion). However, this account cannot explain why items that themselves have no meaning (e.g. pseudowords) also elicit the N400. Other researchers believe that the N400 occurs much earlier, before words are recognized, and represents orthographic or phonological analysis.\n\nMore recent accounts posit that the N400 represents a broader range of processes indexing access to semantic memory. According to this account, it represents the binding of information obtained from stimulus input with representations from short- and long-term memory (such as recent context, and accessing a word's meaning in long term memory) that work together to create meaning from the information available in the current context (Federmeier & Laszlo, 2009; see Kutas & Federmeier, in press). \n\nAnother account is that the N400 reflects prediction error or surprisal. Word-based surprisal was a strong predictor of N400 amplitude in an ERP corpus. In addition, connectionist models make use of prediction error for learning and linguistic adaptation, and these models can explain several N400/P600 results in terms of prediction error propagation for learning.\n\nAs research in the field of electrophysiology continues to progress, these theories will likely be refined to include a complete account of just what the N400 represents.\n\n"}
{"id": "2229053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229053", "title": "Groombridge", "text": "Groombridge\n\nGroombridge is a village of about 1,600 people. It straddles the border between Kent and East Sussex, in England. The nearest large town is Royal Tunbridge Wells, about away by road.\n\nThe main part of the village (\"New Groombridge\") lies in the Withyham civil parish, which forms part of Wealden District of East Sussex. Across the county boundary lies the much smaller and older part of the village (\"Old Groombridge\"). This is within the Speldhurst civil parish, which forms part of the Tunbridge Wells Borough of Kent. At the 2011 Census the population of the Kent portion of the village was included in the civil parish of Frant.\n\nNew Groombridge has a primary school associated with the church of St Thomas, part of the Diocese of Chichester. It has a general store, a bakery, a post office, a hairdresser, a car dealership and the \"Junction Inn\" public house. Old Groombridge has the church of St John, which is part of the Diocese of Rochester. It also has the \"Crown Inn\" public house and the \"Blooming Perfect\" florist.\n\nGroombridge Place is a popular visitor attraction, boasting an impressive 700-year history beginning in 1239. Groombridge Place has been owned by some of Kent's most distinguished families, including the de Cobhams and Sir Richard Waller, ancestor of the poet Edmund Waller as well as of Winston Churchill.\n\nThe first reference we have is from Saxon times, when there was a settlement on the north bank, the Kent side, of the stream which is now called The Grom. The head of the tribe was Groman and it was his responsibility to keep the bridge across the stream to ensure no unwanted types from the South got across. So it became known as Gromensbregge, which became corrupted over the years to Groombridge.\n\nMacKinnnon's History of Speldhurst records that Groman built a castle within a moat and that the Normans later destroyed it after the conquest.\n\nThe next firm evidence is of two Royal Charters. One was granted in 1239 to William Russell and his wife to build a Chantry Chapel to their house at Gromenbregge, endowed with a Priest. This Chapel was dedicated to St John the Evangelist. This indicates another house had been built on the site of the Saxon one. The second Royal Charter, granted to Henry de Gobham in 1286, was to hold a weekly market and a fair once a year on the eve, day and morrow of the feast of St John before the Latin Gate, which translates into 5, 6 and 7 May each year. Groombridge must have been important in the area to have been granted a market. Originally it was held on and around the Green but in Victorian times it moved over the stream to a site in Withyham Road opposite the garage and became a fortnightly cattle market until the 1950s when it closed for good. The fair had died out much earlier in the 1900s. According to legend the finale of each Fair was the rolling of a blazing tar barrel down the hill.\nThe Waller family bought the Manor in 1360 and owned it for about 240 years. In 1604 the estate was sold to Thomas 1st Earl of Dorset. He owned the Buckhurst estate at Withyham and his land, including Pollies Hall, run up to the stream on the Sussex side. In 1610, for Pollies Hall Nicholas Pennyale paid £10 and 2 fat capon alive each year on 1 November.\n\nThomas 1st Earl Dorset died suddenly in 1608 and his grandson Richard 3rd Earl inherited the manor. Richard was profligate and by 1618 he had sold the manor to John Packer. It may have been that sale that brought the lands on the Sussex side, closer to the river, into the manor. Certainly at some time they became part of the estate and some still belong to Groombridge Place today.\n\nThe new owner, John Packer, was a wealthy man, owner of 3 other manors, and a Clerk to the Privy Seal. He would have been familiar with the intrigues of the day and made it clear he did not approve of Prince Charles' somewhat harebrained scheme, encouraged by his father James 1, to go to Spain, in disguise in 1623, in an attempt to woo and wed the Spanish Infanta. John Packer said if Charles failed he would build a chapel on his land at Groombridge as a thank-offering to God for escaping a union with a Catholic country. Charles' plan did fail because the Princess had entered a convent and refused to have anything to do with him. True to his word John Packer built his chapel in 1625. At first it was known as St. Charles' chapel then Groombridge chapel and finally, after 1872, it was dedicated to St John the Evangelist.\n\n\"Burrswood Health and Wellbeing\", situated on land that was once part of the Groombridge Place, was operated as an independent non-surgical hospital, \"\"treating the whole person in a Christian environment\"\". Specialities included palliative and respite care, post-surgical care, rehabilitation, counselling, hydrotherapy and physiotherapy. Burrswood was founded in 1948 when Dorothy Kerin established her healing ministry and was run under a charity, The Dorothy Kerin Trust, also providing healing services, guest house, tea room, gift shop and Christian book shop on the site. In 2016 the trust announced the closure of the hospital however it continued to operate until April 2019 when it closed without advance notice, the charity ceased operations and went into administration and, according to the BBC the staff were not paid their final wages.\n\nGroombridge stood on the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line. Other stations included: Three Bridges, Rowfant, Grange Road, East Grinstead, Forest Row, Withyham, High Rocks, Tunbridge Wells West and Tunbridge Wells Central. The line was operated by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, then Southern, and later British Rail. Groombridge station was finally closed on 6 July 1985.\n\nGroombridge is now on the Spa Valley Railway and is at present the southern terminus of that line. The current Groombridge station is on the east side of Station Road, and a joint ticket for the railway and Groombridge Place is available. A canopy has been erected on both sides of the station, using the former canopy supports from Gravesend West station. A brand new signal box has been constructed on the site and signalling is being installed in conjunction with the extension to Eridge which opened in 2013.\n\nIn 2014 two rooms in the Old Station were leased from Withyham Parish Council and reopen as the ticket office in April 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "2229082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229082", "title": "KSPN (AM)", "text": "KSPN (AM)\n\nKSPN (710 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Los Angeles, California, and serving the Greater Los Angeles Area. The station airs an all-sports radio format. KSPN is owned by The Walt Disney Company and operated through ESPN Radio. The KSPN broadcast license is held by ABC Radio Los Angeles Assets, LLC.\n\nOn weekdays, morning drive time is hosted by Keyshawn Johnson, Travis Rodgers and LZ Granderson. The nationally syndicated Stephen A. Smith Show is heard in late mornings. Mason & Ireland (Steve Mason and John Ireland) host early afternoons, followed by Jorge Sedano in PM drive time. Nights and weekends, most programming comes from the ESPN Radio Network. KSPN is one of two ESPN Radio affiliates in the Los Angeles radio market, the other being KLAA.\n\nKSPN is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to broadcast in the HD Radio (hybrid) format. The transmitter is on Burbank Boulevard at Bellaire Avenue.\n\nThe station first signed on as KRLO on February 19, 1927, broadcasting from Beverly Hills. It was heard on several frequencies in radio's early days, including 1170 kilocycles. It switched to 710 when it was sold to new owners in November 1929, as KEJK.\n\nIn March 1930, it took the call sign that it would hold for 67 years, KMPC. The station was then owned by the MacMillan Petroleum Company, for which the station's call letters were chosen. The studios and offices were on 3651 Wilshire Boulevard, now part of the property of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple. Later, George A. Richards of Detroit acquired the station. KMPC became part of the Goodwill Station group that included WJR in Detroit and WGAR in Cleveland, both also owned by Richards. KMPC soon became Southern California's destination for sports programming, as it carried Pacific Coast League baseball, UCLA Bruins sports and, beginning in 1946, the Los Angeles Rams football team.\n\nLegendary singer and actor Gene Autry bought KMPC in 1952, making it the centerpiece of his broadcasting company, Golden West Broadcasters. Autry eventually owned TV, AM and FM stations around the Western United States. During Autry's ownership, KMPC was a full service middle of the road station, featuring popular music, news and sports. Dick Whittinghill, Geoff Edwards, Wink Martindale, Gary Owens, Bob Arbogast and Roger Carroll formed a powerhouse lineup of disc jockeys during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nDuring 1958 and 1959 baseball seasons, KMPC was also the flagship station for the Los Angeles Dodgers radio network. In 1961, it became the flagship of the new baseball team, the Los Angeles Angels. KMPC and the Angels were both owned by Autry. KMPC remained the Angels' radio voice until 2008 (except for 1997 to 2002). In November 1963, Autry acquired Channel 5 KTLA, LA's top independent television station. The TV station's operations were at 5800 Sunset Boulevard, while KMPC Radio had its studios at 5939 Sunset Boulevard. KTLA was sold to investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1983, while KMPC remained under Autry's ownership.\n\nIn the 1980s, KMPC adopted an adult standards format which featured big bands and vocalists. During this time, the legendary DJ Robert W. Morgan began a long stint as morning host. KMPC also aired a weekday evening sports call-in show hosted by Scott St. James, who was also a TV soap opera actor on the side.\n\nIn the early 1980s, KMPC changed to talk radio and fired its DJs. Whittinghill, Owens, Johnny Magnus and Pete Smith went over to KPRZ and played standards as part of \"The Music of Your Life\" format. A few years later, KMPC returned to standards as \"The Station of the Stars.\"\n\nIn April 1992, KMPC became one of the first all sports stations on the West Coast, billing itself as \"All Sports, All Hours.\" Jim Lampley and Todd Christensen were co-hosts of one program, Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian began their run as a popular local duo \"McDonnell & Douglas.\" Jim Healy, one of the most famous voices in L.A. sports, returned to KMPC after a few years at KLAC.\n\nOther show hosts included Brian Golden and Paola Boivin, Chris Roberts and Jack Snow, Fred Wallin and Tony Femino.\n\nIn 1994, the Autry family sold KMPC to ABC, which already owned the successful talk station KABC. The price tag for KMPC was $17.5 million. On May 2 of that year, KMPC began a general talk format to complement KABC. Hosts such as Tom Leykis, Stephanie Miller, Peter Tilden, and Joe Crummey headlined this new format.\n\nOn February 24, 1997, ABC Radio changed KMPC's call letters to KTZN, and flipped to a women's talk format. The station hired multiple new hosts, including humor writer and David Letterman Show co-creator Merrill Markoe, psychologist Dr. Toni Grant and comedienne (and former KMPC host) Stephanie Miller. Under this format, the station failed to make the top 30 in Los Angeles Arbitron ratings. The women's talk format lasted less than six months.\n\nOn August 26, 1997, Radio Disney was launched on the station with the KDIS call letters, becoming the network's fifth affiliate; the station carried the Disney children's radio service until 2003.\n\nAs an ESPN Radio outlet, KSPN began on the former KRLA (1110 AM) in December 2000, after ABC purchased that station from Infinity Broadcasting. On January 1, 2003, ABC swapped its Radio Disney and ESPN Radio stations in Los Angeles, with 1110 taking Radio Disney and the KDIS call sign, while 710 became L.A.'s ESPN Radio outlet. KSPN was led by the sports talk team of Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian.\n\nThe KMPC call letters were retired until acquired them in 2000. (The KMPC on 1540 kHz also had an all-sports format, using programming from the co-owned Sporting News Radio Network. On May 1, 2007, that station switched to Korean language programming.)\n\nWith ESPN affiliate XEPE in Tijuana-San Diego switching from sports to another format in April 2019, KSPN is serving as the de facto ESPN outlet for San Diego County.\n\n\n\nWhen the all-sports format premiered on KSPN in January 2003, the station was locally focused, bringing in popular local sports talk duo Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian and their \"McDonnell-Douglas Show\" to afternoon drive. Steve Mason & John Ireland, football player D'Marco Farr and longtime ESPN personality Gary Miller were among the hosts who rotated through the midday slot from 2004-2007.\n\nOn November 26, 2007, KSPN introduced yet another local lineup. Mason, sans Ireland, moved into the 1-4 p.m. time slot, followed in afternoon drive by a new show hosted by Dave Dameshek, a member of the Jimmy Kimmel-Adam Carolla comedy connection. Unique to Dameshek's show was a house band similar to those found on late-night television shows. New-to-Los Angeles Brian Long was hired for the evening show. In the programming shakeup, Kevin Kiley, who had served as an on-air foil to Farr, was let go, and, inexplicably, the popular Ireland also was let go. Ireland was rehired in April 2008 and reunited with Mason in the early afternoon time slot.\n\nJust seven months later, on June 23, 2008, another new local lineup was introduced. Mason and Ireland went on from 1-4 while Dameshek was forced to share his show with Long and Dave Denholm, a three-man pairing. Dameshek eventually began a podcast-only show that has become among the parent network's more popular Web offerings, while Denholm and Long continued in afternoon drive.\n\nAfter KSPN got the Lakers rights, the station started morphing their already Trojan- and Laker-heavy talk programming to be even more Laker-centric. On July 10, 2009, unofficially known as \"710 Day,\" \"L.A. Sports Live\" with Andrew Siciliano and Mychal Thompson premiered from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mason and Ireland returned to their old drive time slot (3-7 p.m.), replacing Denholm and Long.\n\nMore time slot changes were made on April 5, 2010: With ESPN having reduced \"The Herd with Colin Cowherd\" to three hours (7-10 a.m. PT), L.A. Sports Live and Mason and Ireland each moved up by one hour but are still on for four hours each. Martinez and Long received a new time slot, 6 to 9 p.m. The local shows originated from ESPN studios at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nKSPN carried two other shows from the network: \"Mike and Mike in the Morning\" and \"All Night with Jason Smith\", the latter of which originated from the KSPN studios. The Scott Van Pelt and Dan Le Batard shows moved over to secondary ESPN affiliate KLAA.\n\nIn December 2010, Mike Thompson was hired as new Programming Director. Thompson reportedly fired Joe McDonnell outside a sandwich shop in Westwood. Thompson also introduced Arnie Spanier and Karl Malone to L.A. radio. Thompson's first move at KSPN was to replace Siciliano with a new show hosted by New Yorker Max Kellerman and former NFL player Marcellus Wiley. Mychal Thompson remained as a Lakers analyst and became a morning show host with Mark Willard, who was let go from the station on August 29, 2014. Thompson continued to broadcast in late mornings with Mike Trudell on \"Thompson & Trudell\" in the 10 a.m. to noon time slot. Long left the station in December to become program director of KIRO, the ESPN Network affiliate in Seattle.\n\nKSPN later added another New Yorker, Stephen A. Smith, to its weeknight lineup, followed by Martinez' \"In the Zone\" talk show. These shows were later dropped and KSPN began carrying ESPN Radio's “The Freddy Coleman Show” in the evenings (when live sports or a team-focused hour is not airing).\n\nIn June 2018, the morning show became \"Keyshawn, Jorge, and LZ\" (Keyshawn Johnson, Jorge Sedano and LZ Granderson). That was followed by the ESPN Network's Stephen A. Smith, hosting the late morning show, followed by \"Mason and Ireland\" in the early afternoon. From 3 to 7 p.m., Marcellus Wiley and Travis Rodgers hosted PM drive time.\n\n"}
{"id": "2229095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229095", "title": "Dimension stone", "text": "Dimension stone\n\nDimension stone is natural stone or rock that has been selected and finished (e.g., trimmed, cut, drilled, ground, or other) to specific sizes or shapes. Color, texture and pattern, and surface finish of the stone are also normal requirements. Another important selection criterion is durability: the time measure of the ability of dimension stone to endure and to maintain its essential and distinctive characteristics of strength, resistance to decay, and appearance.\n\nQuarries that produce dimension stone or crushed stone (used as construction aggregate) are interconvertible. Since most quarries can produce either one, a crushed stone quarry can be converted to dimension stone production. However, first the stone shattered by heavy and indiscriminate blasting must be removed. Dimension stone is separated by more precise and delicate techniques, such as diamond wire saws, diamond belt saws, burners (jet-piercers), or light and selective blasting with Primacord, a weak explosive.\n\nA variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks are used as structural and decorative dimension stone. These rock types are more commonly known as granite, limestone, marble, travertine, quartz-based stone (sandstone, quartzite) and slate. Other varieties of dimension stone that are normally considered to be special minor types include alabaster (massive gypsum), soapstone (massive talc), serpentine and various products fashioned from natural stone.\n\nA variety of finishes can be applied to dimension stone to achieve diverse architectural and aesthetic effects. These finishes include, but are not limited to, the following. A polished finish gives the surface a high luster and strong reflection of incident light (almost mirror-like). A honed finish provides a smooth, satin-like (\"eggshell\"), nonreflective surface. More textured finishes include brush-hammered, sandblasted, and thermal. A brush-hammered finish, similar to a houndstooth pattern, creates a rough, but uniformly patterned surface with impact tools varying in coarseness. A sandblasted surface provides an irregular pitted surface by impacting sand or metal particles at high velocity against a stone surface. A thermal (or flamed) finish produces a textured, nonreflective surface with only a few reflections from cleavage faces, by applying a high-temperature flame. This finish may change the natural color of the stone depending on mineralogical composition, particularly with stones containing higher levels of iron.\n\nThe most easily accessible general (non-graphic) references are the latest Minerals Yearbook Chapter (production and foreign trade, with statistics), and the latest (Issue 31) Dimension Stone Advocate News (new \"building green\" developments and demand statistics); see below. The most comprehensive, graphic references are Natural Stone Database by Abraxas Verlag (www.natural-stone-database.com), \"Dimension Stones of the World, Volumes I & II\" (Marble Institute of America) and \"Natural Stones Worldwide CD\" .\n\nWhile common colors used in some of the major applications are listed below, there is an extraordinarily wide range of colours, available in thousands of patterns. These patterns are created by geological phenomena such as mineral grains, inclusions, veins, cavity fillings, blebs, and streaks. In addition, rocks and stones not normally classed as dimension stone are sometimes selected for these applications. These can include jade, agate, and jasper.\n\nStone (usually granite) countertops and bathroom vanities both involve a finished slab of stone, usually polished but sometimes with another finish (such as honed or sandblasted). Industry standard thicknesses in the United States are 3/4\" (2 cm) and 1.25\" (3 cm). Often 2 cm slabs will be laminated at the edge to create the appearance of a thicker edge profile. The slabs are cut to fit the top of the kitchen or bathroom cabinet, by measuring, templating or digital templating. Countertop slabs are commonly sawn from rough blocks of stone by reciprocating gangsaws using steel shot as abrasive. More modern technology utilizes diamond wire saws which use less water and energy. Multi-wire saws with as many as 60 wires can slab a block in less than two hours. The slabs are finished (i.e., polished, honed), then sealed with resin to fill micro-fissures and surface imperfections typically due to the loss of poorly bonded elements such as biotite. The fabricators shop cuts these slabs down to final size and finishes the edges with equipment such as hand-held routers, grinders, CNC equipment, or polishers. In 2008, concerns were raised regarding radon emissions from granite countertops; the National Safety Council states that the contributions of radon to inside air come from the soil and rock around the residence (69%), the outdoor air and the water supply (28%), and only 2.5% from all building materials-including granite countertops. A concerned homeowner can employ ASTM radon mitigation and removal techniques. The stone for countertops or vanities is usually granite, but often is marble (especially for vanity tops), and is sometimes limestone or slate. The majority of the stone for this application is produced in Brazil, Italy, and China.\nTile is a thin modular stone unit, commonly 12 in. square (30.5 cm) and 3/8 in. (10 mm) deep. Other popular sizes are 15 in. square (38 cm), 18 in. square (46 cm), and 24 in. square (61 cm); these will usually be deeper than the 12 in. square. The majority of tile has a polished finish, but other finishes such as honed are becoming more common. Almost all stone tile is mass-produced by automated tile lines to identical size, finish, and close tolerances. Exceptions include slate flooring tile and special orders: tile with odd sizes or shapes, unusual finishes, or inlay work. In summary, the automated tile line is a complicated complex of cutting and calibrating machines, honing-polishing machines, edging machines that put on flat or rounded edges, and interconnecting conveyors to move the stone from the slab input to the final tile product. The stone for tiles is most commonly marble, but often is granite, and sometimes limestone, slate, or quartz-based stone. Common colors are white and light earth colors. Much of the stone for this application is produced in Italy and China.\n\nStone monuments include tombstones, grave markers or as mausoleums. After being gangsawed into big deep (up to wide and over 6 inches deep) slabs, smaller saws or guillotines (they break the granite and make the rough edges commonly seen on monuments) shape the monuments. The fronts and backs are usually polished. The individual monuments are then carved, shaped, and further defined by hand tools and sandblasting equipment. At this time, the stone for monuments is most commonly granite, sometimes marble (as in military cemeteries), and rarely others. Granite and quartz both demonstrate good durability, especially because rain is naturally acidic. (This is a natural consequence of the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere, which generates a weak solution of carbonic acid in rainfall; further acidification of rainfall arises from oxides of sulphur and nitrogen due to anthropogenic emissions). (Limestone and sandstone were commonly chosen for monuments in the nineteenth century, but they are no widely longer used because of the rapid erosion rates due to dissolution of acid-vulnerable carbonates by acidic rainfall.) The most common monument colors for granite are gray, black, and mahogany; for marble, white is most popular. Today, the majority of the stone used in North America in this application is imported from countries such as India and China. This has depressed traditional North American monument centers such as Georgia and Quebec.\nThere are a number of smaller applications for buildings and traffic-related uses. Building components include stone used as veneer, a non load-bearing facing of stone attached to a backing of an ornamental nature, although it also protects and insulates; and ashlar, a squared block of stone, often brick-sized, for facing of walls (primarily exterior). Other shapes include rectangular blocks used for stair treads, sills, and coping (coping is sometimes nonrectangular). The shapes subject to foot traffic will usually have an abrasive finish such as honed or sandblasted. The stone is mostly limestone, but often is quartz-based stone (sandstone), or even marble or granite. Roofing slate is a thin-split shingle-sized piece of slate, and when in place forms the most permanent kind of roof; slate is also used as countertops and flooring tile. Traffic-related stone is that which is used for curbing (vehicular) and flagstone (pedestrian). Curbing is thin stone slabs used along streets or highways to maintain the integrity of sidewalks and borders. Flagstone is a shallow naturally irregular-edged slab of stone, sometimes sawed into a rectangular shape, used as paving (almost always pedestrian). For curbing, the stone is almost always granite, and for flagstone the stone is almost always quartz-based stone (sandstone or quartzite).\n\nThere are several other applications resembling flagstone in using rough dimension (or crushed) stone, usually as quarried, sometimes made smaller (i.e. by a jackhammer), often simply put in place: dry stone and riprap.\n\nThe stone used in these applications usually has to have certain properties, or meet a standard specification. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has such specifications for granite, marble, limestone, quartz-based dimension stone (C616), slate (C629), travertine (C1527), and serpentine (C1526).\n\nThe major producers of dimension stone include Brazil, China, India, Italy, and Spain, and each have annual production levels of nine to over twenty-two million tons. Portugal produces 3 million tons of dimension stone each year.\n\nAccording to the USGS, 2007 U.S. dimension stone production was 1.39 million tons valued at $275 million, compared to 1.33 million tons (revised) valued at $265 million in 2006. Of these, granite production was 453,000 tons valued at $106 million in 2007 and 428,000 tons valued at $105 million in 2006, and limestone was 493,000 tons valued at $93.3 million in 2007 and 559,000 tons valued at $96.1 million in 2006. The United States is at best a mid-level dimension stone producer on the world scene; Portugal produces twice as much dimension stone annually.\n\nWorld comparison for dimension stone demand: The DSAN World Demand Index for (finished) Granite was 227 in 2006, 247 in 2007, and 249 in 2008, and the World Demand Index for (finished) Marble was 200 in 2006, 248 in 2007, and 272 in 2008. The DSAN World Demand for (finished) Granite Index showed a growth of 12% annually for the 2000-2008 period, compared to 14% annually for the 2000-2007 period, and compared to 15% annually for the 2000-2006 period. The DSAN World Demand for (finished) Marble Index showed a growth of 13.5% annually for the 2000-2008 period, compared to 14.0% annually for the 2000-2007 period, and compared to 12.5% annually for the 2000-2006 period. The indexes show world demand for granite has clearly been weakening since 2006, while the world demand for marble only weakened from 2007 to 2008. Other DSAN indexes for 2008 indicate that the 2000-2008 growth was down from the 2000-2007 growth.\n\nThe DSAN U.S. Ceramic Tile Demand Index shows a drop of 4.8% annually for the 2000-2007 period, compared to growth of 5.0% annually for the 2000-2006 period. The \"traditional\" major ceramic tile suppliers, Italy and Spain, have been losing markets to new entrants Brazil and China. The same thing has been happening with dimension stone with increasing supplies from Brazil, China and India.\n\nIn 2008, Chinese exports of granite countertops and marble tile increased from 2007, while those of Italy and Spain did not (see above, world demand) In early 2009, the Chinese Government has a hands-off policy towards its dimension stone industry.\n\nGreen building or environmentally friendly construction with natural materials, is an idea that has been around for several decades. Energy price increases and the need for energy conservation when heating or cooling buildings have recently brought it to the fore. This resulted in the formation in 1993 of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), which has developed a building rating system called Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Educational institutions (colleges, universities, grade, and high schools) are often requiring new buildings to be green, and a few jurisdictions (i.e., some cities) have some rules promoting green building. When \"building green\", dimension stone has a big advantage over steel, concrete, glazed glass and laminated plastics, whose productions are all energy intensive and create significant air and water pollution. As an entirely natural product, dimension stone also has an advantage over synthetic/artificial stone products, as well as composite and space-age materials.\nOne LEED requirement provides that the dimension stone used in a green building be quarried within a radius of the building being constructed. This gives a clear advantage to domestic dimension stone, plus some quarried near the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico. A current problem is how to consider stone quarried domestically, sent to China or Italy for finishing, and shipped back to be used in a project. \n\nWhen demolishing a structure, dimension stone is 100% reusable and can be salvaged for new construction, used as paving or crushed for use as aggregates. There are also \"green\" methods of stone cleaning either in development or already in use, such as removing the black gypsum crusts that form on marble and limestone by applying sulfate-reducing bacteria to the crust to gasify it, breaking up the crust for easy removal. See DSAN for updates on \"building green\" and dimension stone recycling.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in America is re-examining and will most likely update its \"Green Guides\" used to regulate green advertising claims. The updating will emphasize green building, including the products it involves, such as dimension stone. When the new requirements are finalized, the FTC will go after firms that violate the new requirements, in order to establish legal precedents.\n\nThe Natural Stone Council has a library of information on building green with dimension stone, including life-cycle inventory data for each major dimension stone, giving the amount of energy, water, other inputs, and processing emissions, plus some best practice studies (see below). In addition, it has shown ways that dimension stone can contribute LEED points, such as using a light-colored dimension stone to reduce heat-island effects, using dimension stone's thermal mass to impact indoor ambient air temperature thereby increasing energy efficiency, and especially by reusing dimension stone rather sending it to the landfill.\n\nDimension stone is one of the most sustainable of the industrial minerals since it is created by separating it from the natural bedrock underlying all land on every continent. Dimension stone rates very well in terms of the criteria on the ASTM checklist for sustainability of building products: there are no toxic materials used in its processing, there are no direct greenhouse gas emissions during processing, the dust created is controlled, the water used is almost completely recycled (per OSHA/MSHA regulation), and it is a perpetual resource (virtually inexhaustible in a human time scale). Dimension stone in use can last many generations, even centuries, so the dimension stone manufacturers have not needed a product recycling program. However, there are practical qualifications to and constraints on that sustainability. The dimension stone color and pattern can be changed by weathering when it is very near the surface. The color and pattern can also be changed by proximity to an igneous rock body or by the presence of circulating groundwater charged with carbon dioxide (i.e., limestone, travertine, marble). On the other hand, changes in color and/or pattern can be positive. For example, there are at least 14 separately trade-named varieties of Carrara Marble with many patterns (or no patterns) ranging in shade from white to gray. The presence of faults or closely spaced joints can render the stone unusable. These faults and joints do not have to be at odd angles in the stone mass. Closely spaced, wrongly spaced, or nonparallel bedding planes can make the stone unusable, particularly if the bedding planes are planes of weakness. If part of the stone in one area is unusable, there will be another usable part of the stone elsewhere in the formation. A quarry is not a short-term project unless it encounters one of these constraints. Examples of big, old quarries operating for more than a century include the Barre (VT) granite quarry, the Georgia Marble quarry at Tate, several of the Carrara (Italy) marble quarries, and the Penrhyn (Wales) slate quarry. A quarry will produce dust, noise, and some water pollution, but these can be remedied without too much trouble. The landscape may also have to be restored if quarry waste is temporarily or permanently placed on adjacent land.\n\nRecycling dimension stone can occur when structures are demolished, along with recycling timber and recycling construction aggregate in the form of concrete. The material most likely to be recycled is concrete, and this represents the largest volume of recycled construction material. Not too many structures incorporate dimension stone, and even fewer of them have dimension stone worth saving. Stone recycling is usually done by specialists that monitor local demolition activity, looking for stone-containing houses, buildings, bridge abutments, and other dimension stone structures scheduled for demolition. Particularly treasured are old hand-carved stone pieces with the chisel marks still on them, local stones no longer quarried or that are quarried in a different shade of color or appearance. There is no national or regional trade in reclaimed stone, so a large storage yard is required, since the recovered stone may not be quickly sold and reused. The recycled dimension stone is used in old stone buildings being renovated (to replace deteriorated stone pieces), in fireplace mantels, benches, veneer, or for landscaping (like for retaining walls).\nRelated to stone recycling and stone reuse is the deconstruction and reconstruction of a stone building. The building is taken apart stone block by stone block and the location and orientation of each block is carefully noted. Any roofing slate and interior stone in place is catalogued and moved in the same fashion. After the blocks, slate, and other stone used have been transported to the new location, they are put back in place where and how they were originally, thus reassembling the building. This is typically very expensive and rare but valuable in terms of historic preservation.\n\nDimension stone is also reused. Buildings immediately spring to mind, but such things as the ornate stone walls, arches, stairways and balustrades alongside a boulevard can also be renovated and reused. Sometimes the old interior of the building is kept as is, after repair. Sometimes the old building is gutted, leaving only a shell or facade and the space inside reconfigured and modernized. The stone work will usually need attention too.\n\nThe old stone work may only need cleaning or sandblasting, but it may need more. Firstly, the building exterior (facade) needs to be inspected for unsafe conditions. Next, the building walls need to be inspected for water leakages. The most likely needs are mortar restoration (repointing), applying consolidants to the old stone, or replacing pieces of stone that are deteriorated (damaged) beyond the point of any repair. The repointing is the removal of existing damaged mortar from the outer portion of the joint between stone units and its replacement by new mortar matching the appearance of the old. The consolidants re-establish the original natural bonding between the stone particles that weathering has removed. Deteriorated pieces of stone work are replaced with pieces of stone that match the original as much as possible. Exterior dimension stone will often change color after exposure to weather over time. For example, Indiana Limestone will weather from a tan to an attractive light yellow. Interior dimension stone can sometimes change its shade a little over time too. For both, it may not be possible to find an exact match, even from the original quarry. Stone will often change its appearance from location to location in the same quarry. If the dimension stone renovationist is truly fortunate, the original builder put aside some spare pieces of the stone for future need.\n\nAs in every economic sector, the construction industry's purchases of materials and services creates a whole chain of processes from raw material selecting in situ, removal from the earth, usually proceeding to cutting, finishing, or processing/manufacturing, then transport, and retailing. All of these activities have significant upstream (off-site) environmental impacts, whether in terms of energy and raw resource use or emissions to air, land, or water impacting living organisms or the Earth's surface (non-organic). Life cycle assessment is a method for estimating and comparing a range of environmental performance measures (e.g. global warming, acidification potential, toxicity, ozone depletion potentials) over the full life cycle of a product, a building assembly, or a whole building. As such, it provides a comprehensive means for evaluating and comparing products rather than prescriptive measures of individual product characteristics.\n\nThe ASTM has some relevant standards, particularly a guide on environmental life cycle assessment of building materials/products (E1991) that shows how to minimize the subjectivity that commonly mars and confuses environmental decision making. In particular, this guide describes the inventory analysis phase that requires data that is suitable for its intended purpose, thus covering data quality (such as completeness, reliability, accuracy, and credibility) as well as the allocation of the data (for multiple inputs and outputs), among other things. Results have to be on a common basis to allow a statistically significant comparison of alternative building product differences in the interpretation.\n\nThe Natural Stone Council (NSC) has commissioned some life-cycle inventory data for use in life cycle assessments. Almost 90% of the effort in doing a life cycle assessment involves getting reliable data. For example, the NSC has data that the Global warming potential for granite quarrying is 100 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents and for granite processing is 500 (same units); and the Global Warming Potential for limestone quarrying is 20 kg carbon dioxide equivalents while for limestone processing it is 80 (same units). The data on energy and water use include everything back to removal of overburden in the dimension stone quarry and upstream production of energy and fuels, and forward to packaging of finished dimension stone product or slabs for shipment and transport, or to moving scrap stone to storage or reclamation and to capturing and treatment of dust and waste water. The data is then placed in an impact category (i.e. changes to air, changes to water), characterized as to the contribution of the item to the impact compared to other items, and then the impact categories are assigned weights among themselves to show their relative importance.\n\nThe Natural Stone Council has also commissioned four Best Practices. One is on water consumption, treatment, and reuse while extracting and processing dimension stone, including dust mitigation, sludge management, and maximizing water recycling. Another is on site maintenance and quarry closure, including minimizing dust, noise, vibration and keeping the operation clean and tidy, both of which help in restoring the surface upon quarry closure. A third one is on solid waste management, including overburden, damaged stone unsaleable as product, sludge deposited from waste water, spent or spilled petroleum products, or metal scrap. The fourth one is on efficiently transporting stone to be finished as products, then transporting the products to consumers by centralizing freight management, consolidating small loads, choosing appropriate trucks, balancing and securing the load, and packaging with sustainable materials.\n\nThe selector of dimension stone begins by considering stone color and appearance, and how the stone will match its surroundings. In addition to many hundreds of different stones with different colors and patterns, each stone can change radically in color and appearance when a different finish is put on it. A polished finish accentuates the color and makes any pattern more vivid, and the rougher finishes (i.e. honed, thermal) lighten the color and make the patterns more subdued. \n\nIn addition to selecting a stone color and pattern, the suitability of its properties for the intended use must be considered. Stone being chosen for countertops or vanities should be nonabsorptive, resist stains, and be heat and impact resistant. Stone being used in tiles should be sealed in order to resist staining by spilled liquids. Stone being used for flooring, paving, or surfaces subject to foot or vehicular traffic ought to have a semiabrasive finish for slip resistance, such as bush-hammered or thermal. A glossy polished finish will be slick. Most flagstone surfaces are rough enough to be naturally slip-resistant.\n\nDimension stone requires some specialized methods for cleaning and maintenance. Abrasive cleaners should not be used on a polished stone finish because it will wear the polish off. Acidic cleaners can not be used on marble or limestone because it will remove (i.e. dissolve) the finish. Textured finishes (thermal, bush-hammered) can be treated with some mildly abrasive cleaners but not bleach or an acidic cleaner (if marble or limestone). Stains are another consideration; stains can be organic (food, grease, or oil) or metallic (iron, copper). Stains require some special removal techniques, such as the poultice method. A new method of cleaning stone on ancient buildings (medieval and renaissance) has been developed in Europe: sulfur-reducing bacteria are used on the black gypsum-containing crusts that form on such buildings to convert the sulfur to a gas that dissipates, thus destroying the crust while leaving the patina produced by aging on the underlying stone. This method is still in development and not yet commercially available.\n\nThe surface of a stone may be finished in a variety of ways. Below are some typical terms:\n\nCategories:\n\n"}

Didrich Jansen Fasmer (1706-1770) improved it and built another gun mill in the 1760s. Towards the end of the 1700s, Alvøen became an industrial site with working houses attached to the factories. Later it started production of saltpeter, linseed oil and paper. Hendrik Jansen Fasmer (1766-1836) founded the paper mill during 1797.

It was started in 2004 and features teams from Major League Soccer and the United Soccer Leagues. The Columbus Crew edged out D.C. United on goal differential to win the 2004 competition, while the San Jose Earthquakes won the 2005 competition. San Jose's second iteration (although a separate team), the Houston Dynamo, won the 2006 and 2007 versions. The San Jose Earthquakes again won the tournament on their return to the MLS in 2008 while Real Salt Lake claimed the title in their debut in 2009.\n\nOver the first few years of the tournament, the champion had gone on to win one of the two year-end MLS trophies, the Supporters' Shield or MLS Cup. This streak ended in 2008 as San Jose Earthquakes failed to make the playoffs, consequently missing out on both titles. Between 2008 and 2010 it either predicted the MLS Cup winner or the team with the worst record in the league. San Jose and D.C United had the worst records in 2008 and 2010 respectively, while Real Salt Lake won the 2009 MLS Cup.\n\nThe tournament has always featured four clubs in a round-robin format, with each club playing three games over the span of a week.\n\nThe cup competition was established in 2004 by the Charleston Battery, who invited teams from Major League Soccer to participate.

The Carolina Challenge Cup resumed in 2017.\n\nA highlight of the competitions that have been held so far is the Coffee Pot Cup, a game between D.C. United and the host Charleston Battery, making it a rare example of an MLS-USL team rivalry.

A news report from then:\n\n\"D.C. United apparently used the visitors' locker room to vent its frustration over losing to the Charleston Battery in last Wednesday's US Open Cup match at Blackbaud Stadium here. Members of the Major League Soccer team smashed two coffee pots and pulled off some showerheads, according to Battery officials. 'I think a bill will be sent to them,' Battery general manager Buckley Andrews said earlier this week. The US Soccer Federation website's match report on Charleston's 4-3 overtime win over the two-time MLS champion called it 'one of the biggest upsets ever seen in American soccer history ... It will surely go down as an Open Cup classic.'\"\n\nAfter a few years, supporters of both sides in the name of spirited competition decided to have an actual Coffee Pot played for between the sides as a friendly wager. The winner has the other team's supporters fill the Cup with beer for the winning team's supporters to enjoy. Supporters of both sides say that whenever the two sides play, they are playing for the Coffee Pot Cup (the two sides could meet in the U.S. Open Cup if drawn together, or in an arranged friendly). The inaugural winners of the Cup in 2004 were D.C. United after winning 2-1. In 2005 and 2006, the two teams played to a tie (2-2, 1-1), meaning no one had to pay for the beer to fill the Cup, but D.C. maintained possession. \n\nMainly due to their commitment to play in the CONCACAF Champions League, D.C. United were unable to play in the 2007 and 2008 versions of the tournament.\n\nMost recently the teams competed in the final of the 2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, as D.C. United defeated Charleston 2-1 on September 3, 2008 at RFK Stadium.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2229186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229186", "title": "Sheeda", "text": "Sheeda\n\nThe Sheeda is a fictional race created in comics published by DC Comics. They first appear in \"Seven Soldiers\" #0 (April 2005), and were created by Grant Morrison and J.H. Williams III. Their first DC Universe appearance was in Morrison's introductory run on the \"\" series in 2004.\n\nThe Sheeda are a blue-skinned race from the future. Sheeda are either capable of changing size or existing in a wide variety of sizes. The smallest are a little larger than mosquitoes. These Sheeda can take control of a sentient being by attaching themselves to the back of the creature's neck. They are also somehow related to both spiders and scorpions. In addition, they are capable of inter-breeding with regular humans. They are masters of both science and magic. As such, they have created creatures such as the Mood 7 Mind Destroyer (Guilt) and the Submissionary Constructs.\n\nAccording to comical fiction, the Sheeda are tied to Seven Imperishable Treasures, based on the Four Treasures of Celtic myth. Thus far, we have seen the Foundation Stone of Manhattan (based on the Lia Fáil), the hammer of Bors (possibly based on Mjolnir) the Cauldron of Rebirth, the Gwydion (a homunculus made of 'living language', based on Merlin) and the sword Excalibur (possibly the counterpart of the sword of Nuada). \"Seven Soldiers of Victory\" #1 lists the seven treasures as Gwydion the Merlin, The Undry Cauldron (Dagda's Cauldron), Pegazeus the flying horse, Excalibur, the all-knowing Fatherbox, the Hammer, and the Spear whose name is both love and vengeance (possibly a reference to the Gáe Bulg, but eventually revealed to be the progeny of Aurakles, the first superhero).\n\nOnce a civilization reaches a certain level of development, the Sheeda arrive to 'harvest' it; to destroy its monuments and defeat its champions. Over the course of the story, they accomplish this task with Arthurian Camelot (according to the story, Arthurian Camelot is a recurring motif in history: the particular Camelot destroyed by the Sheeda existed in the 81st century B.C.).\n\nMore recently, the Sheeda have returned, first via the Miracle Mesa in the American Southwest which, according to local Native American legend, rotates through other worlds. The Sheeda, as a preparation for the defeat of the era's champions (such as the Justice League), lure a team of superheroes (the reformed Seven Soldiers of Victory, who ominously number only six) to the area and defeat them in an event known as the Harrowing. The Sheeda are deeply superstitious about teams of seven members, and seek to destroy all such teams.\n\nThe Sheeda traditionally attack humanity in a period of utopia. This time, however, they have been drawn out by Zor, the \"Terrible Time Tailor\", a renegade member of the Seven Unknown Men of Slaughter Swamp.\n\nThe first three issues of \"JLA: Classified\" were published before any part of \"Seven Soldiers of Victory\", and appear to be a prelude to that series. In \"JLA: Classified\", the Sheeda arrange for the disappearance of the Justice League and subsequently enslave the Ultramarine Corps superteam that responds in the League's absence to an emergency instigated by the Sheeda and Gorilla Grodd. The Sheeda are defeated, but the scale of their threat is not fully understood, let alone halted.\n\nThe Sheeda \"ambassador\" Neh-Buh-Loh promises an upcoming \"Harrowing\" and claims that the incursion was merely a test of the Earth's superheroes; the next time the Sheeda attack, Neh-Buh-Loh claims, they will be more stealthy about it. It is likely that \"Seven Soldiers\" depicts this latter, more stealthy approach.\n\nThe Sheeda are not extra-dimensional, inhuman, or diabolical. They are from the future: roughly one billion years from now. They are either a mutated or genegineered form of humanity, or they are the race that replaced humanity. Whichever, the Earth now orbits a dying sun, and mismanagement of the planet by the Sheeda has reduced it to a wasteland. The black flowers of Slaughter Swamp now cover the Earth, the seas are reduced to mist.\n\nIn this world live the Sheeda. Their culture is horrific - described as 'a grim parody of civilization' by one character. Its arts, sciences and ecology are at a standstill. However, they have discovered time travel technology. Using this, they travel back through time, come to a certain era, and lay waste to the planet, taking almost everything of value and taking most of the populace as slaves. First, it provides for their world, since it has fallen into shambles, and second, it gives the populace something to do besides plot an uprising.\n\nIn an interview Grant Morrison explained that:\n\"\"[These soldiers] are recruited into an apocalyptic battle with some ancient Enemies of Humanity, a race of beings called the Sheeda, who are familiar to us from folk tale and legend as 'the Unseelie Court', or the people of 'Faerie' among many other names,\" Morrison said. \"Periodically, these Sheeda arrive like locusts in their millions in huge floating 'Castles' they use to 'harvest' civilizations which have reached their peak. The Sheeda ransack these cultures and take away their treasures, their achievements, their learning to enrich their own burned-out culture.\"\"\n\"The name is from the Irish Sidhe, pronounced 'Shee', as in banshee. The Sidhe were the Fairy Folk, the strange ones from the hills who haunt the old legends of so many cultures. I had a wild idea about what these legends might REALLY be describing and realised I'd found the perfect villains for this story. I based my portrayal of the Sheeda civilization itself on a dark, inverted Goth image of Queen Elizabeth 1's England. They're very evil, decadent and corrupt but as I say we don't reveal their TRUE nature and who they really are until later in the series. In FRANKENSTEIN! issue 4 in fact, 'Frankenstein vs. Fairyland'.\"\"\n\nIn the representation of Sheeda's language depicted in Shining Knight #4 Morrison used the Ogham alphabet.\n\n\n\n"}

His principal commercial activities involve importing apparel, toys and other goods into Australia from China and share market investments, principally in retail companies.\nHe was formerly a director then Chairman of the board for Coles Myer (now known as the Coles Group) until voted out by shareholders after a series of controversies related to his private dealings with the company. He was also involved in an unsuccessful attempt to resurrect Ansett airlines with Lindsay Fox following its collapse in September 2001. In 2008 he returned to the board of his public company vehicle Premier Investments and became its chairman.\n\nWhile Chairman of Coles Myer, Lew involved Coles Myer in a deal with a private company Yannon Pty Ltd which ultimately lost Coles Myer 18 million. The money was used to help fund a company of Lew's called Premier Investments which in turn owned shares in Coles Myer. The money was used to help meet Lew's debt servicing obligations to banks, which were high due to his high level of indebtedness and high interest rates at the time. An internal Coles investigation endorsed Lew's claim that he knew nothing of the deal, and a subsequent four-year investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) ended with no charges being pursued.\n\nAlan Cameron, ASIC chairman at the time, acknowledged during the press conference to announce the outcome of the investigation that: \"It is worth saying that the original loss suffered by Coles Myer was about 18 million, and the recovery made by Coles Myer was in excess of 12 million.\" Lew contributed to this 1996 settlement with Coles-Myer. Cameron also said that it was \"clearly true\" that Lew was not guilty of any breaches of the law. When asked if he believed Lew was innocent, Cameron replied: \"of course.\"\n\nABC Radio's \"PM\" program described the transaction:\nWhen Coles Myer's chief financial officer, Philip Bowman, resigned and revealed the details of the transaction it brought a great deal of unwanted public attention to Lew. Bowman's revelations prompted an investigation into whether the Yannon transaction broke the Corporations Law or other laws that lasted five years and gathered a quarter of a million pages of documents and twelve thousand pages of evidence. The ASIC recommended criminal prosecution against Lew in its brief, although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, who had the final decision, decided not to proceed with criminal charges against Lew, Lew's advisers, or those working within Coles Myer. The Chairman of ASIC told the ABC:\nAnother controversial business transaction involving Lew related to a single purpose trust called Etiket. The beneficiaries were Lew's family. The trust was used to acquire 2% of Coles Myer in 1989, at a time of high interest rates. Lew offered competing explanations for what happened next. But the end result was that the Coles Myer shares were assigned to Premier Investments for an 8 million profit. A Queen's Counsel who investigated the transaction said:\nLew and Lindsay Fox formed a consortium to acquire Ansett Airlines after it had an Administrator appointed. They sought and obtained the exclusive right to negotiate to purchase the airline. They obtained the agreement of various stakeholders in the airline, including trade union members and their representatives. Greg Combet, the secretary of the ACTU said Lew had breached 'repeated commitments'. During this time spent negotiating, the administrators had been persuaded to continue to operate the airline despite heavy losses which reduced the amount ultimately available to creditors, which included employees owed entitlements. Lew and Fox had committed to take on 183 million of these entitlement obligations if they acquired the company. These commitments and their statements that they could and would proceed with the acquisition led the trade unions with members involved in the business to support the bid. The consequence of Lew's withdrawal was much embarrassment for the ACTU, which had strongly supported the Lew-Fox bid. Lew's withdrawal also cost 2,800 people their jobs.\n\nIn September 2002, a resolution to remove Lew from the Board of Coles Myer was successful after Stan Wallis, the Chairman of the company, campaigned for Lew's removal. Wallis successfully lobbied major institutional shareholders, including insurance companies, banks and large investment firms to take the rare action of voting against an incumbent director. Prior to the vote, Lew campaigned heavily spending an estimated 10 million campaigning for his re-election focusing mainly on smaller shareholders. He was successful in obtaining millions of proxies but they were ultimately insufficient.\n\nIn March 2008, Lew returned to the public company stage, rejoining the board of the listed company Premier Investments, as its chairman. At the same time, Premier announced a takeover offer for Just Group, one of Australia's largest retailers which owns Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jay Jays, Smiggle and Jacqui E. Analysts criticised the offer for being too low and comprising less than half in cash. In publicly explaining his offer, Lew said Just Group was trading worse than had been disclosed to the investment community. Just Group's Dr Pollard disputed this claim and threatened to report Lew for breaching the Corporations Law and rules relating to takeovers for making claims of this kind outside the formal documentation associated with his bid. Media commentators were strongly critical of Lew's tactics, with one describing him as \"stunningly gauche\".\n\nLew is Jewish and is a member of the Chabad House synagogue in Malvern, Victoria. He is separated from his wife Rosie. They have three children who are active in the Lews' business empire:\n\nIn 1999, each of his children was gifted 170 million from the \"Lew Custodian Trust\" established to minimise taxes. The trust has become the main subject of the acrimonious divorces of two of his children.\n\nIn May 2019 \"The Australian Financial Review\" estimated Lew's net worth as 2.83 billion as published in the \"Financial Review Rich List\"; and in January 2019 his net worth was estimated by \"Forbes Asia\" as 1.90 billion as published in the list of Australia's 50 richest people. Lew is one of thirteen living Australians who have appeared in every \"Financial Review Rich List\", or its predecessor, the \"BRW Rich 200\", since it was first published in 1984.\n\n\n"}

ASA took over the Guinea Airways existing fleet of five DC-3s and an Auster, and added a 52-seat Convair 440 VH-BZH.\n\nFrom inception, ASA provided services from Adelaide to Port Lincoln, Minnipa, Ceduna, Cowell, Cleve, Kimba, Radium Hill, Broken Hill, Kangaroo Island, Port Pirie, Whyalla, Renmark, Mildura and Woomera.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, services were briefly added to Naracoorte, Millicent and tours to Hayman Island, Queensland from Adelaide while several initial services were progressively discontinued. A Piaggio P166 and a Fokker F-27 Friendship (the first of several) replaced older aircraft.\n\nIn November 1968 \"Airlines of South Australia\" was renamed \"Ansett Airlines of SA\" (AASA). By 1973, the fleet had reduced to three Fokker F-27s. In the mid-1970s, AASA trialled special interest weekend flights and began services to Mount Gambier. In 1979, charter flights to the gas fields at Moomba began. In 1980, a route sharing agreement was commenced with Rossair, and in 1981 Ansett reverted AASA back to the original name \"Airlines of South Australia\". However, ASA faced increasing competition through the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1985, Ansett announced that another subsidiary Kendell Airlines would progressively move onto South Australian routes. In February 1986, Ansett announced that ASA would cease operations by July. The last passenger flight was made to Whyalla in June 1986.\n\nAirlines of South Australia (ASA) was reborn in 1987 as a small regional airline]. It operated scheduled between Adelaide, Port Lincoln, Port Augusta, and Kingscote all in South Australia, as well as charter flights. It was part of the RegionalLink Airlines group which also included Airnorth and Emu Airways. Its main base was Adelaide International Airport (ADL). Both ASA and Emu Airways ceased operations on 9 November 2005.\n\nThe airline was established in 1987 as Lincoln Airlines (based in Port Lincoln). It merged with Augusta Airways (based in Port Augusta) and was renamed Airlines of South Australia (ASA) in 1997.\n\nIn October 2003, Airnorth (based in Darwin, Northern Territory) purchased both Airlines of South Australia and Emu Airways (another small regional airline, based in Adelaide, operating from Adelaide to Kingscote) and merged the three companies into a single business entity called RegionalLink owned by aviation services company Capiteq Group. The participating airlines continued to trade in their local markets under their own names, the logos of which were featured on the fuselages of aircraft within the group.\n\nOn Monday 31 October 2005 Capiteq Limited, the parent company of Airlines of South Australia and Emu Airways, announced its intention that both airlines would cease operations effective Wednesday 9 November 2005, citing the entry of QantasLink (soon to start flying to Port Lincoln and Kingscote) and other factors in their decision.

Founded in 1897, Piedmont's Demorest campus includes 300 acres in a traditional residential-college setting located in the foothills of the northeast Georgia Blue Ridge mountains. Total enrollment is approximately 2,571 students and the campus includes ten dormitories housing more than 720 students.\n\nPiedmont College offers more than 50 undergraduate academic programs in the Schools of Arts & Sciences, Business, Education, and Nursing & Health Sciences. Students may earn Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Science (BS), or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees. Graduate programs include Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Education Specialist (EdS), and Doctor of Education (EdD).\n\nThe college opened as the J.S. Green Collegiate Institute in 1897, founded by residents of Habersham County, Georgia. The first president was Reverend Charles C. Spence. The American Mission Board of the New England Congregational Churches operated the college from 1901 to 1948 and changed the name to Piedmont College to represent the geographic region. In 1948, under president James Walter, the college became an independent institution, although it maintains an affiliation with the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the related National Association of Congregational Christian Churches (NACCC). Congregationalists took over the school from the Methodists in the early 20th century.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1990s, Piedmont grew slowly and developed a reputation as a small college with high academic standards. The college graduated a large number of teachers who went on to distinguished careers in education across the state. In 1994 the college began to expand, adding schools for Business and Nursing & Health Sciences to its existing programs in the Arts and Sciences and Education. The college also opened a campus in Athens, Georgia, and began offering off-campus graduate education courses across the state. The Demorest campus grew substantially with the addition of the Arrendale Library; Stewart Center for Mathematics, Science and Technology; Swanson Center for Communications and the Performing Arts, Mize Athletic Center, the Smith-Williams Art Studios, and in 2015 the Student Commons. The college also added five new dormitories and 48 apartment-style residences.\n\nToday Piedmont is one of the most dynamic small colleges in the Southeast, known equally for its academic programs in education, business, nursing and health sciences, and the arts and sciences. As a member of the USA South Conference of the NCAA Division III, Piedmont competes in 17 men’s and women’s sports.\n\nPiedmont has two campuses, the original one in Demorest and the newer expansion in Athens. Piedmont's Demorest campus is located on roughly in Habersham County. The Athens campus is located on Prince Avenue near downtown Athens, on the site of the original Prince Avenue Baptist Church.\n\nThe Demorest campus is primarily a residential campus, with ten dormitories, including Getman-Babcock, Purcell, Wallace, Swanson, Johnson, Mayflower, New Bedford, Plymouth and Ipswich halls that together house about 600 students. The Piedmont Village (apartment-style living which opened in 2015) houses an additional 180 students.\n\nThe academic buildings include Daniel Hall, which houses the R.H. Daniel School of Nursing, the Humanities Department, and administrative offices. Stewart Hall houses the Science and Math Departments. The School of Education is located in the Arrendale Library. The Walker School of Business is located in Camp Hall, which is adjacent to the President’s Home. The Music department is located in the Center for Worship and Music, which includes classroom and performance space, as well as the Sewell Pipe Organ, a 3,675-pipe organ built by the Casavant Frères company of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.\n\nThe Art Department is located in the Smith-Williams Studios and adjacent Martens Hall. The Mason-Scharfenstein Museum of Art is located in downtown Demorest. It features a large permanent collection and hosts numerous exhibits throughout the year.\n\nThe Mass Communications and Theatre Departments are located in the Swanson Center for Performing Arts and Communication, a $14-million building which features two theaters and editing rooms for print, video and web productions. Next door is the Arrendale Amphitheater, a 500-seat outdoor venue. WPCZ, the student-run radio station, is housed in the Swanson Center, along with the student-run TV station, PC60.\n\nThe campus also includes Walker Fields for softball, soccer and lacrosse, as well as Loudermilk Baseball Stadium for baseball. The Johnny Mize Athletic Center houses the O’Neal Cave Arena for basketball and volleyball. The Mize Center includes a museum featuring displays of Mize’s baseball memorabilia collected during his career at Piedmont and as a Hall of Fame player in the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants (New York Giants) and New York Yankees.\nThere are also a few general purpose buildings. Lane Hall, which faces the quad, is the remodeled old gym, which houses the Student Success Center. There is also the President's House, the Admissions building and the pedestrian bridge which crosses Historic U.S. 441. The bridge was assembled off-site and lowered into place by crane, and was modeled after the Vanderbilt University 21st Avenue Pedestrian Bridge. The installation of the bridge was a joint project of the Georgia Department of Transportation, Piedmont College and the city of Demorest.\n\nMuch of Piedmont's Demorest property is now wetlands. The wetlands area was once the site of Lake Demorest from 1890-2008. The lake was drained due to an irreparable dam, and the property was turned into a wetlands for students and faculty to use in their studies.\n\nThe heart of student life at Piedmont is the new Student Commons, which opened in the fall of 2015. The 58,000 square foot commons features the campus dining hall, fitness center (complete with a full-size basketball court with a walking track, a rock-climbing wall and a racquetball court), the official Piedmont College bookstore and a Starbucks cafe. The commons also is home to Student Services and has a state-of-the-art conference room and study rooms as well as staff offices.\n\nThe college opened a small outreach facility in 1996 and now occupies seven buildings near the heart of downtown Athens on Prince Avenue. The campus offers four-year undergraduate programs designed for both traditional and non-traditional students. For graduate students, there are programs in business (MBA), nursing (BSN and MSN), and education (MA, MAT, EDS, and EDD).\n\nThe Athens campus includes Commons Hall, which houses the majority of classrooms and faculty offices, as well as a large assembly room and dining hall. The School of Business is located in Rogers Hall, and there is a large recreation center for intramural and fitness activities. Lane Hall on North Milledge Avenue houses the library and facilities for the School of Nursing and Health Sciences.\n\nPiedmont is accredited by the following organizations: Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS); National League of Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC); and the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).\n\nPiedmont College is composed of four schools: the School of Arts & Sciences, the School of Education, the Harry W. Walker School of Business, and the R.H. Daniel School of Nursing & Health Sciences.\n\nStudents can take courses in nine departments that comprise the School of Arts and Sciences. These departments include: Art, Humanities, Interdisciplinary Studies, Mass Communications, Mathematics & Physics, Music, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Theatre. Through these departments, students can earn Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, and Bachelor of Science degrees.\n\nThe Harry W. Walker School of Business received national accreditation in November 2007 from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) for the undergraduate and graduate business programs at both Piedmont’s Demorest and Athens Campuses. Through the School of Business, students can earn a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Business Administration or a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. The BA program includes concentrations in accounting, finance, general business, management, and marketing. The MBA program is a lock-step 12-course program that offers the convenience of evening courses and can be completed in as little as 18 months.\n\nThe School of Education offers bachelor's degree programs in fields including Early Childhood, Middle Grades, Drama, Secondary, and Spanish education. Students can also earn Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) or Master of Arts (MA) degrees in a variety of areas. Beyond the master's degree, the school offers Education Specialist (EdS) and Doctor of Education (EdD) degree programs.\n\nThe R.H. Daniel School of Nursing & Health Sciences offers the BSN degree for students preparing for initial licensure. Separate BSN tracks are also available for students who already hold RN or LPN degrees.\n\nIn addition to clubs and service organizations, Piedmont offers creative outlets for singers, musicians, and actors. All students can be part of the 100-voice Piedmont Chorale, which performs several concerts each year. The Piedmont Singers is a 50-member ensemble of selected students that performs on campus and each year tours in the U.S. or abroad. Performance groups also include the 10-member Cantabile a cappella singers, Piedmont Camerata chamber ensemble, Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and String Ensemble.\n\nStudents interested in theatre may join the Piedmont College Theatre and the Alpha Psi Omega theatre honor society, which together perform a succession of plays each year ranging from Shakespeare to children's theatre.\n\nStudents interested in writing, photography, radio, television, and web production can also participate in a number of student-run organizations including the student newspaper and media channel, \"The Roar\" [formerly The Navigator]; the Yonahian yearbook, and student radio and TV stations.\n\nThe first publication for the college was \"The Mountain Lantern\", which was named for a common firefly in the surrounding area. \"The Lantern\" started out as a monthly magazine in 1912. In 1913, \"The Lantern\" became the college's yearbook. There would not be a magazine again until the spring semester of 2006, when a mass communications major published \"PC Magazine\" as her senior capstone project. In the fall of 2007, the magazine was renamed \"Pause\", which came out twice each semester; two print and two online. \"Pause\" has since been out of production.\n\n\"The Mountain Lantern\" lasted for only a short period until 1915. A yearbook was again issued in 1920, and the name was changed to the \"Yonahian\". The odd-sounding name was derived from nearby Mount Yonah. Since 1920, the \"Yonahian\" has been published every year and provides a general record of students and faculty.\n\nThe first newspaper of Piedmont was \"The Hustler,\" which lasted from 1908 to 1909. There was no newspaper until 1917, when a bi-weekly newspaper named \"The Padded Hammer\" appeared in September. Later in 1917, after a vote on the name of the paper, it was changed to \"The Piedmont Owl\". The name was chosen as a reference to the concept of wisdom. This became the name of Piedmont's athletic teams as well, until 1921, when the Student Association adopted the name Mountain Lions, later shortened to Lions.\n\nThe \"Piedmont Owl\" lasted for 67 years until the name was changed to match Piedmont's newer mascot. The paper became \"The Lion's Roar\" for 21 years until 2005, when it was changed to \"The Navigator\". The name is a reference to the \"Mayflower\" ship of the Pilgrims, honoring Piedmont's relationship to American Congregationalism. In the fall of 2015, all the college's media outlets were consolidated under the umbrella name of \"The Roar\".\n\nThe Office of the Chaplain provides a variety of opportunities for religious expression among students. As a church-related college, Piedmont recognizes that faith and learning are frequently intertwined. In keeping with Congregationalism, the college acknowledges that each individual understands and relates to God in a unique way, and that the student body will always represent a breadth of religious backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences. Spiritual life at Piedmont exists to nurture and nourish the spiritual health and well-being of the students, faculty, and staff.

{"id": "2229218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229218", "title": "Come Taste the Band", "text": "Come Taste the Band\n\nCome Taste The Band is the tenth studio album by the English rock band Deep Purple, originally released in October 1975. It was co-produced and engineered by the band and longtime associate Martin Birch. It was the final Deep Purple studio record prior to the band's initial disbandment in 1976, therefore making it the only album to feature Tommy Bolin, who replaced Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, and the final of three albums to feature David Coverdale on lead vocals and Glenn Hughes on bass, as none of the three would be involved with the reactivated Deep Purple in 1984.\n\nIt is also notable for being the only Deep Purple studio album where Blackmore and vocalist Ian Gillan are both absent from the lineup (with every prior and subsequent album featuring at least one of the two).\n\nWhen Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple in 1975, there was uncertainty over whether the band would continue, as they did when Ian Gillan and Roger Glover left in 1973. It was David Coverdale who asked Jon Lord to keep the band together, and Coverdale was also a major factor in recruiting Tommy Bolin to take the guitar slot after hearing Bolin's work on the Billy Cobham solo album \"Spectrum\".\n\nRehearsals for the album were recorded by Robert Simon, who was originally engineering the album. But after a dispute with the band over scheduling, the band left Simon's Pirate Sound Studios in favour of Martin Birch.\n\nAccording to Glenn Hughes, Lord and Bolin's personal reel to reel tapes, at least six songs were written well in advance of the album's recording. \"You Keep on Moving\" had been written in 1973 by Hughes and Coverdale, but was rejected for inclusion on the \"Burn\" album by Blackmore. \"Lady Luck\" was written by Bolin's friend and songwriting partner, Jeff Cook (who was also the vocalist in Bolin's band Energy), around late 1972, but Bolin couldn't remember all the lyrics when the band hit the studio and the group couldn't get hold of Cook. So Coverdale rewrote much of the lyrics, and the song was included with Cook's blessing. The main riff for \"Gettin Tighter\" was written by Bolin sometime in 1974 while working on \"Teaser\"; Hughes later wrote the lyrics in the studio. \"Owed To G\" was written by Bolin in late 1974, while Bolin was in \"The Gassers\". The song \"Dealer\" was originally written as \"Poker Chips\" by Bolin sometime in 1975, while the main chord progression for \"Love Child\" was written by Bolin in Fall 1974 when he was playing with Alphonse Mouzon.\n\nThe remainder of the album was mostly written in Los Angeles, then recorded in Munich, with the exception of \"Comin' Home\" which was written in the studio. According to Ian Paice, the song was the result of a jam session between he and Bolin while waiting for the others to arrive; an out-take was released. Hughes had gone back to England before the completion of the record so he could deal with his then-rampant cocaine addiction, and he cites this as the reason for Bolin playing the bass and singing the lower-register backing vocals on \"Comin' Home\". Bolin's vocal also replaces Hughes' vocals on the last verse of the song \"Dealer\". Hughes did not find out until after the album was released. The album shows the strong funk influence from Hughes at this point, now working with the equally funk and jazz influenced Bolin, but the direction tended to be more like 1974's \"Burn\", with a heavier focus on rock guitar. The recording with Bolin also allowed the band to take many creative liberties, as Blackmore had been somewhat difficult to work with on the band's two previous albums due to creative differences with Hughes and Coverdale.\n\nGenerally the record is considered one of Deep Purple's lesser efforts, although it did sell reasonably well on release (#19 in the UK charts, and #43 in the US) and received a rave review in the leading British music paper \"New Musical Express\". The album was certified Silver on 1 November 1975 by the BPI, selling 60,000 copies in the UK.\n\nIn recent years the album has received some critical reassessment \"on its own merits\", in part due to Bolin's contributions to the album. Gillan (who left the band just over two years prior), on the other hand, has stated that he does not view the album as a real Deep Purple album. Lord praised the quality of the album years later in interviews, stating that \"listening to it now, it's a surprisingly good album,\" while acknowledging, \"the worst thing you can say about it is that, in most people's opinion, it's not a Deep Purple album.\"\n\nIn 1990, the album was remastered and re-released in the US by Metal Blade Records and distributed by Warner Bros. It was re-released again on the Friday Music label on 31 July 2007, along with \"Made in Europe\" and \"Stormbringer\". While the label's website claims that the album has been digitally remastered, it is unclear which tapes were used as a source for this remastering, but it is unlikely the original master tapes were used, as EMI had repeatedly claimed over the years that the master tapes of this album were missing.\n\nIn December 2009, the Deep Purple Appreciation Society (DPAS) reported the original multi-track masters had recently surfaced and that an official remastered version with bonus tracks (including remixes by Glenn Hughes and Kevin Shirley) would see a release in 2010.\n\nReleased on 25 October 2010, the 2-CD Deluxe 35th Anniversary edition includes the original album in remastered form plus a rare US single edit of \"You Keep On Moving\" on the first disc, and a full album remix and two unissued tracks on the second disc: \"Same in LA\" a three-minute out-take from the final release in 1975, and \"Bolin/Paice Jam\" a five-minute instrumental jam with Bolin and Ian Paice.\n\nThe tour to support this album started strong, according to Lord in the documentary video \"Deep Purple – Getting Tighter, The Story of MK-IV\" (2011), in Hawaii, Australia and New Zealand. However, according to Lord and Hughes on the same documentary, in Jakarta, Indonesia, the band was 'set up' for murder. Specifically the two affirmed that Hughes and two others were \"framed\" for the death of the band's highly trained security worker, Patsy Collins, who died under 'suspicious circumstances'. Hughes and the two others were placed in jail. The promoter also sold a second night's show, and forced the band to play for only the original fee for one night. Hughes was taken from jail at gunpoint to the second show, and returned to jail promptly afterwards. During this time, Bolin was given morphine by the promoter, which caused problems on the band's next stop in Japan. In order for the band to be allowed out of the country with the \"charges\", Deep Purple's management had to forfeit their entire fee as well as pay thousands more out of their pocket to the Army and Airport Security to fly out of the airport in Jakarta.\n\nTheir next stop was Japan, immediately afterwards. Bolin had taken the drugs given to him and fell asleep for an excess of 8 hours on his arm, causing a pinched nerve that rendered his left (fretting) hand virtually useless. According to Hughes, many of Bolin's guitar parts were covered by Lord on his organ and other keyboards. Lord (and in other interviews, Ian Paice) stated that to carry on with the concert, Bolin had several guitars tuned to open keys, minor and major, depending upon the song being played. He would make \"a bar position\" with his fingers, and play a basic rhythm while Lord played the melodies. Unfortunately, the show was filmed. In the opening song, \"Burn\", it's Lord's organ playing the opening riff that should have been played on Bolin's guitar (as was done by Blackmore in the original recording). The later dates on the Japan tour, with Bolin having recovered, and some of the American shows were much better received.\n\nOn touring with Bolin, Paice stated: \"Tommy could be an absolute genius, but that happened one show in twenty. If Tommy got his hit and it was good, and he slept well, and the sound was right, and his equipment didn't break, and the audience was nice, and the sun shone between 1 pm and 2 pm, then yeah, he could be great. But chances of that happening on a regular basis were very remote. It could go from the sublime to the absolute worst end of ridiculous.\"\n\nAfter tours for this album concluded in March 1976, Deep Purple broke up for eight years. Tommy Bolin formed his own band that toured in support of Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck, but it was short-lived as he died of multiple drug intoxication in December, 1976. Morphine, cocaine, lidocaine and alcohol were all found in his system.\n\n\n"}

Greg Raelson, media officer for U.S. Navy, said in an e-mailed statement.

The song is about a dilemma between settling down or trying to become a rock star. The song was written by Adams and Jim Vallance, a long-time writing partner of Adams. \"Summer of '69\" was produced by Adams and Bob Clearmountain. It was released in June 1985 under A&M Records as the fourth single from \"Reckless\". \"Summer of '69\" is an up-tempo rock song.\n\nThe song was released with two B-side tracks; \"Kids Wanna Rock\" and \"The Best Was Yet to Come\", which had previously appeared on the albums \"Reckless\" and \"Cuts Like a Knife\" respectively. \"Summer of '69\" received favourable reviews from music critics. The single had a strong effect on music charts internationally, with its highest peak being number four in the Netherlands, and its least successful charting country being Germany. The track was promoted with a music video, which was filmed by Steve Barron. The video features Adams and his backing band in a variety of settings, including running from the police.\n\nAfter a tour supporting his album \"Cuts Like a Knife\", Adams immediately started the recording sessions for the new album, \"Reckless\". \"Summer of '69\" was finished on January 25, 1984, co-written with Jim Vallance in his basement studio. The song went through a number of changes because neither Adams nor Vallance was convinced it was a strong enough song to be featured on the album. In their first draft, the lyric \"summer of '69\" appeared only once. At that time the two were planning to title it \"Best Days of My Life\" instead. While the lyric \"Best days of my life\" appeared seven times in the first draft, on the final draft it had been replaced by \"summer of '69\" and appeared only two times throughout the song.\n\nWhen writing the lyrics \"Jimmy quit, Jody got married\", Vallance suggested using \"Woody quit and Gordy got married\", referring to members of his high school band, but Adams liked his version better. Adams mentioned once in an interview that \"Jimmy\" was one of his early drummers. \"Jody\" is a reference to Adams' sound manager, Jody Perpick, who got married during the album's recording session.\n\nOn the song's very first demo, it started with a 12-string riff, just like the breakdown section in the middle of the song, but they replaced it with a chunky 6-string intro on the second demo. The song was recorded three to four times, in different ways, with both Adams and Vallance still not convinced that it was finished.\n\nWhen Adams appeared on \"The Early Show\" in 2008, he was asked about \"Summer of '69\" and its lyrical meaning. Adams said the song was about sex and making love in the summertime. \"69\" is a reference to the sexual position, 69. Vallance however has gone for the more conventional interpretation of the title being a reference to a year. He notes Jackson Browne's \"Running on Empty\", which contains references to 1965 and 1969, as his own influence, and recalls Adams citing the film \"Summer of '42\" as his.\n\"That song is 25 years old now so it's had that many years to incubate. A lot of songs, like that one, hit big in America but really not anywhere else. It didn't chart anywhere in Europe until at least 10 years after it was released. [...] I think songs can have a life of their own regardless of the promotion.\"\nIn 1985 the song won the BMI (Broadcast Music Inc.) Citation of Achievement for US radio airplay, the following year 1986 – Procan Award (Performing Rights Organization of Canada) for Canadian radio airplay and in 2000 it won a Socan Classics Award for more than 100,000 Canadian radio performances. In a poll conducted by Decima Research in 2006, \"Summer of '69\" was voted the best driving song among Canadians who sing in their cars. The song topped the survey with both sexes, and with French and English-speaking Canadians. In 2010, the song was voted the \"hottest summer song\" in Germany. In another poll, this time by Canadian magazine \"Chart\", \"Summer of '69\" was voted the fourth best song of all-time in 2000; four years earlier it had been voted the twenty-fourth best song of all-time. The song was ranked #17 on CBC Radio's \"\". In 2008, the song was voted the 87th best-song of all-time by radio listeners in Norway, becoming the second highest Adams song ranked, the highest being \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" from 1991. It was voted the fourth best-song ever on Radio 2, a Belgian radio station, in 2008.\n\n\"Summer of '69\" remains popular to this day in many countries around the world. Adams sang \"Summer of '69\" during the 2011 Cricket World Cup opening ceremony in Bangladesh. More recently Adams performed a duet version of \"Summer of '69\" with Taylor Swift during her Reputation Tour in Toronto, Canada.\n\nIn its 2005 list \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\", \"Blender\" ranked the song 70th and commented that the song \"made people who hadn't yet had either a first love or a first band nostalgic for the experience.\"\n\n\"Summer of '69\" has found itself in several \"best of\" lists compiled by various music publications and critics, including the following:\n\nUpon the release of the album \"Reckless\" in November 1984, \"Summer of '69\" received some airplay on album-oriented rock radio stations but was mostly overshadowed by the tracks \"Run to You\" and \"It's Only Love\", only managing to reach number 40 on \"Billboard\"'s Top Rock Tracks chart. After it was released as a single in June 1985, \"Summer of '69\" climbed to number 5 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and helped push \"Reckless\" to the number one position on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart in August 1985. Like the previous single released from \"Reckless\", \"Heaven\", \"Summer of '69\" was a commercial success worldwide. On the UK Singles Chart, \"Summer of '69\" debuted at number fifty-nine, and managed to climb up the chart, and two weeks later reached its peak position of 42, on August 24, 1985. The single remained on the country's chart for four consecutive weeks from August to September 1985, before falling out of the top 100. The track debuted at number twenty-two on September 22, and peaked at number seven in the fifth week on the New Zealand Singles Chart. The song debuted at 95 on the Canadian \"RPM\" Singles Chart on June 29, 1985, jumping to fifty in its second week and peaking at eleven on September 14, 1985 after spending seven weeks on the chart.\n\nThe song debuted at its peak position, number 9, on August 10, on the Norwegian Singles Chart and stayed there for another four weeks before falling off the charts. \"Summer of '69\" charted on the Swedish Singles Chart for five consecutive weeks. Having debuted at number twenty on December 13, and peaked at number thirteen two weeks later. The single spent another three weeks on the chart before falling off. The track peaked at number seventeen on the Austrian Singles Chart, and remained on the country's chart for five weeks. The single's most commercially successful charting territory was the Netherlands, where it peaked at number 4 on September 22, 1990. The single's least successful chart territory was Germany. Having peaked on the country's singles chart at number sixty-two, the single spent the next five weeks fluctuating down the chart.\n\nThe music video, released in 1985, was directed by Irish director Steve Barron. In 1985 the music video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category for Best Male Video. While the song did not win the award, it was one of the four nominated songs from Adams' fourth studio album \"Reckless\". The video includes appearances by Lysette Anthony and Garwin Sanford.\n\n"}

Amalner is the birthplace of the Wipro company, which started business by producing vanaspati ghee from sunflower seeds there. Amalner is a tehsil in Jalgaon district. Prominent villages under Amalner's administration include Sarbete, Chaubari, Shirsale, Chandani kurhe, Nagaon BK, Eklahare, Pimpali, Dahiwad, Amalgaon, Gandhali, Pilode Mehergaon, Javkhede, Padlsare, Vavade, Fapore, Patonde and Mangrul.\n\nAmalner lies on the Western Railway between Surat and Bhusawal. Amalner is well connected to the Central Railway through Jalgaon / Bhusaval as well as the Western through Surat.\n\nAmalner has a historical importance in the fields of education, industrialisation and independence movements. It is host to one of the oldest philosophical centres in India, the Pratap Tatwadnyan Mandir, formerly the Indian Institute of Philosophy.\n\nPandurang Sadashiv Sane, popularly known as Sane Guruji, was one of the famous teachers at Pratap high school. He fought for the independence of India, was a teacher, poet and writer, and wrote many books, including \"Shyamchi Aai\" and \"Bhartiya Sanskriti\".\n\nIn 1945, Azim Premji's father started the first dalda factory at Amalner, which is now known as a mother plant of the giant Wipro company. Amalner city is still densely populated with Wipro shareholders. Azim Premji visited Amalner's Wipro plant on 12 February 2013, to address the employees of the company.\n\nThere is a historical gate for the entrance in Amalner called \"DAGDI DARWAJA\".\n\nThe famous philosopher and Vedic-Pandit \"Nyayacharya Shriram Shastri Shankar Guru Upasani\" was resident of Amalner. He was a gold medalist student of Varanasi Sangveda Vidyalaya. He had eminent knowledge of astrology, Sanskrit, philosophy, Vedanta, Brahmana, and Ayurveda, along with other subjects. Shri Shriram Shastri Upasani not only taught astrology and Sanskrit to academic students but also to many Jain Sadhus (from them many are now well known Sanskrit-astrology experts and book writers). The eminent knowledge of astrology is now continued by his son Pt. Vishweshwar Shastri Upasani.\n\nThe northern part of Amalner is called \"Pratapnagar\", after Srimant Pratap Shethji, for whom the institutes Pratap College and Pratap high school are also named.\n\nAmalner is as regarded as 'Prati Pandharpur' in the Khandesh region, meaning \"as holy as Pandharpur\". Centuries ago, Saint Muktai resided in the district and made it a holy place. The great Shri Sant Sakharam Maharaj is from Amalner. Shri Sakharam Maharaj travels to Pandharpur every year in a procession called \"Paai wari\". This procession takes place in the month of Ashadh (Indian calendar). The honour of organising the first procession (dindi) to visit Lord Vitthal in Pandharpur goes to Amalner. In every Vaishakh month, there is a huge funfair, the biggest in the region, at the Bori river. At that time there is a Rath-Yatra at Vaishakh Ekadashi as well as a Palakhi at Pornima. As a mark of solidarity among communities, the first mogari (a wooden log used as a break for stopping Rath) is always placed by Muslims, and before Rath reaches its destination, Rath stops at a Mosque for Aarati and Dohe. Amalner is second to Pandharpur, in Maharashtra. Two visits to Amalner is as beneficial as one visit to Pandharpur.\n\nSaint Shree Sakharam Maharaj of Amalner was a devotee of Lord Vithal. To commemorate him, the Ashadhi Ekadashi celebrations take place at Amalner parallel to the celebrations at the magnificent temple of Lord Viththal in Pandharpur.\n\nIt is famous for the Jain Temple of \"Lord Chandraprabhu\" who was 8th Thirthankar of Jain's and temple of \"Kshetrapal Maharaj\". It is believed that a visit to the temple on the day of Amavsya will lead to the fulfillment of all wishes. Another emerging place, Ratnapimpri, 11 km from Amalner and 7 km from Parola tahsil, is situated on the bank of the Gopi river where a famous Shivdham temple is located. And, 2 km away, Tapovan is situated, where farmers are experimenting with organic farming. It is emerging as a tourist and religious place for devotees as it is calm and peaceful, being located away from busy city life. There is a myth stating that people used to find pearls (Ratnna) at Ratnapimpri. Therefore, the town is known as 'Ratnapimpri'. Amalner hosts a weekly market on every Monday, and people from the surrounding area come for shopping. Amalner is also famous for handmade household equipment called ghamelas, made from brass and copper.\n\nMandal, the biggest village in Amalner taluka, is situated on the bank of the Panzara river. It is located around 20 km from Amalner. Shirsale is the smallest village in Amalner taluka. It is located around 9 km from Amalner. It is famous for the Jain temple of \"Lord Mahavir\". Chandani kurhe is a small village in Amalner taluka. Kurhe khurd & Kurhe budruk are situated on each bank of the river Chikhali.

Thousands of people visit this temple every day, and it is believed that it fulfills all wishes, having the power of the great Swami Samarth Maharaj.The temple of Swami Samarth Maharaj is situated near the Bus Stand of Amalner. There is a big gate for entering in the temple.\n\nThe history of the name of Amalner is interesting and provides some important information. In 11th century Rishi Ambarishi prayed to the god Varun (the god of rain). Varun then built the temple of the god Shiv, called \"Varuneshwar\", which became famous in the area. Amabarishi then named the village Amalnir, which means \"the village with pure water\" or \"where there is no mal (impurity) in water is Amalnir\". Over time, the name changed to Amalner. The hill close to Amalner is called \"Ambarishi Tekdi\" where there is Fun fare in every monsoon. It is said that Ambarishi fulfills wishes of all who pray. Apart from Varuneshwar, there are two more shiv temples famous in Amalner, named Khaleshwar and Khateshwar Mahadev mandir, which is on the bank of the Bori River.\n\nAmalner is also famous for the industrial area (MIDC).\n\nAmalner is also famous for Mangal Grah Temple. There are very few such temples in world. It is the only 1 temple in maharashtra.\n\nAmalner is located at 18°56′N 75°20′E / 18.93°N 75.33°E / 18.93; 75.33[1]. It has an average elevation of 188 metres. It is 36 km from Dhule.\n\nAs of the Indian census of 2001, Amalner had a population of 91,456. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. The average literacy rate is 73%, higher than the national average of 59.5%, with 57% of the males and 43% of females being literate. Some 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nAmalner has seen ups and downs in the educational field, just as in the industrial field.\n\nPratap Shethji founded a well-known school and a college in Amalner, both of which were named after him: Pratap High School and Pratap College. Shri Sane Guruji served in Pratap High School as teacher.\n\nPratap College once had the largest library in Maharashtra and hosted thousands of books. Pratap college has CGPA 3.52 Grade A+. The Pratap college campus area is about 40Acres.\n\nPratap Shethji founded \"तत्वद्न्यान मंदिर\" (Philosophy Hall) in 1966, which hosted books on the subject of philosophy. Earlier in India, the study of philosophy was based on western philosophy only. This hall gave an opportunity to bring traditional books based on Dharmashastra under one roof.\n\nPratap College, Amalner now affiliated to North Maharashtra University, earlier was part of University of Pune and has produced many rank holders, scientist.\n\nThe Khandesh Education Society manages the day-to-day operations of these institutes, as well as Khandesh Education Society's College of Pharmacy (For D-Pharmacy).\n"}

Wilson planned to destroy after capturing Montgomery, Alabama. Dividing his army, he detailed Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange to attack West Point, while he himself moved downriver to the manufacturing centre of Columbus.\n\nWest Point was fortified by the earthwork of Fort Tyler, commanded by Confederate Brig. Gen. Robert C. Tyler, for whom it was named. Union artillery and dismounted cavalry, armed with Spencer repeater-carbines, soon forced the garrison to surrender, Tyler being shot dead by a sniper, and becoming the last Confederate General killed. On hearing of the victory at Columbus, Union troops were free to burn the bridge and the railroad stock. It was one of the last battles of the war.\n\nAfter defeating Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's defenders at Selma on April 2, 1865, and capturing Montgomery, Alabama, on April 12, U.S. Brig. Gen. Wilson turned his raiders' attentions toward the Chattahoochee River to the east. He telegraphed Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas:\n\nIf I can now destroy arsenals and supplies at Columbus and divide their army in the southwest, they must disintegrate for lack of munitions. There is no force to resist me, and I see no reasonable ground for fearing failures. My command is in magnificent condition.\n\nThe river was swollen by rains, so capturing a bridge would be required to make swift progress. Wilson determined that either one of two locations with bridges would suit this purpose: the one at West Point or the more heavily defended one at Columbus. The two towns were only 35 miles apart and Wilson divided his force to attack both, in order to increase the chances of one being taken intact. Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange's brigade was detailed to attack West Point.\n\nWest Point did not have mills or foundries, but it was a critical rail center. As the connecting point for two railroads of different gauges, West Point had an extensive rail yard with many locomotives and rail cars.\n\nThe railway bridges were commanded by Fort Tyler, a 35-yard square earthwork upon a hill on the Alabama side of the river. It had walls four-and-a-half feet high, surrounded by a ditch six to ten feet deep and seven to twelve feet across. The fort was equipped with a 32-pounder siege gun and two 12-pounder field pieces.\n\nOn the morning of April 16, La Grange's brigade approached West Point. The brigade consisted of the 2nd and 4th Indiana Cavalry, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, the 7th Kentucky Cavalry, and the 18th Indiana Battery of light artillery. The cavalry troopers were armed primarily with Spencer carbines.\n\nAwaiting them at Fort Tyler was a small group of Confederates, somewhere between 120 and 265 men, under the command of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Tyler. In addition to the three cannon of the fort, the convalescents and militia were armed with smoothbore muskets.\n\nSkirmishing began at 10 a.m., as the fort's pickets were driven in. The Federal battery set up half a mile away on Ward's Hill and began shelling the redoubt while cavalrymen dismounted to serve as skirmishers and invest the fort. Shelling continued until 1:30 p.m. when La Grange arrived with the remainder of the brigade. The dismounted cavalry pressed the fort and exchanged fire with the defenders, closing within 50 yards and sniping at the defending artillerists. The Federals also removed long planks from nearby structures in preparation to span the ditch.\n\nAs the Federals sniped at the Confederate artillerists attempting to man their pieces, Col. La Grange hoped to use the distraction to secure his primary objective, the bridge span, before it could be burned by the rebels. He led the 4th Indiana Cavalry on a mad dash for the bridge. Seeing this the defenders in the fort turned their cannon to halt the foray, but as the cavalry approached the bridge they soon exceeded the effective range of the cannon. An exploding shell from the 32-pounder did succeed in killing the colonel's horse, two pack animals and resulting in the colonel being stunned and sprawled on the ground. Charging across the bridge the riders encountered a gap where planks had been removed, but were able to spur their horses over and overcome the Confederate defenders on the east side of the Chattahoochee River. Here they dispersed a small defensive force that had incendiaries for burning the structure.\n\nWith the defenders pinned inside their fort, Federal artillery and sniper fire suppressed the counter fire of the defenders who lacked protection from headlogs. As a result, many of the Confederate killed and wounded suffered head wounds.\n\nThe garrison commander's attention was drawn to fire from nearby structures, which Tyler had been urged to burn before the engagement, but had spared because he did not believe the owners could withstand the loss. According to a participant Tyler bravely exposed himself to examine the battlefield and was quickly shot dead by a sniper who was operating from a nearby cottage. Shortly thereafter, his second-in-command, Captain Celestino Gonzalez was also killed and Col. James H. Fannin assumed command.\n\nTo end the stalemate the dismounted troopers crossed the ditch using their planks. Running low on ammunition, some defenders threw rocks and lit shells over the parapet. A cavalry bugle sounded a final charge as the Union soldiers stormed over the embankment, and the fort immediately surrendered.\n\nUnion casualties were seven men killed and twenty-nine wounded. The Confederates' losses were nineteen killed, twenty-eight wounded, and two hundred eighteen captured. The death of Brigadier General Tyler is noted as the last Confederate general to die in a battle. The Confederates who died were buried in what is now known as the Fort Tyler Cemetery in town on the east side of the river. It is believed but not confirmed that the Union dead were buried there as well. In addition, at least 50 other unknown Civil War soldiers are interred there.\n\nThe rolling stock of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad, along with commissary stores had been sent to West Point before Montgomery fell. Because of their narrow gauge, these trains were trapped. After the fort surrendered, Federal cavalry took control of the town of West Point and the vital bridges over the river. The raiders then proceeded to burn the entire rolling stock of the railroad, 19–20 locomotives and 340–350 cars. Before the cars were fired, some foodstuffs were removed and given to the mayor of West Point to feed the wounded of both sides as well as destitute citizens. The bridges were spared only briefly, as La Grange awaited word of the attack on Columbus to know if they would be needed.\n\n"}

His parents were Ferdinando Carlo, nobleman of Poreč and Vis, and Giovanna Parich (\"Parić\", \"Perić\"), noble of Republic of Dubrovnik. Because of his mixed Italian-Croatian ancestry, his family was at different times also known as Vukić, a Croatianized variant of the name Lupis (both meaning \"wolf\"), and he himself is occasionally referred to as Ivan Vukić, especially by Croatians.\n\nIn the city of Fiume, Giovanni Luppis's family has been powerful shipowners. Luppis attended a gymnasium in Fiume and the Collegio di marina, the Austrian naval academy in Venice. Then he married a noblewoman, the Baroness Elisa de Zotti.\n\nHe served in the Venezianisch-Österreichische Kriegsmarine (after 1849 K.u.K Kriegsmarine ) and rose up the ranks to the position of \"Frigate Captain\" (\"Fregattenkapitan\"). In 1848/1849 he was an officer on the ships that blockaded Venice.\n\nAbout the middle in the 18th century, an officer of the Austrian Marine Artillery conceived the idea of employing a small boat carrying a large charge of explosives, powered by a steam or an air engine and remotely steered by cable to be used against enemy ships. Upon his death, before he had perfected his invention or made it public, the papers of this anonymous officer came into the possession of Capt. Giovanni Luppis.\n\nThe second model was built with a clock mechanism as the engine for the propeller. The explosives were in the stern and were ignited through a pistol-like control, which in turn was activated through the bow, the sides or the mast. It had two rudders: one turned to the right, the other to the left, that were moved by ropes/wires from land. After numerous experiments, this design, marked '6 m', finally performed but not well enough. He nicknamed it 'Salvacoste', Italian for \"Coastsaver\".\n\nIn 1860, after Luppis had retired from the Navy, he managed to demonstrate the '6 m' design to the Emperor Franz Joseph, but the naval commission refused to accept it without better propulsion and control systems.\n\nIn Fiume in 1864, the future mayor Giovanni de Ciotta introduced Luppis to the British machine engineer Robert Whitehead, manager of the local factory \"Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano\", with whom he signed a contract to develop the 'salvacoste' further.\n\nAfter looking at Luppis's previous efforts Whitehead built a model but decided that the idea was not viable. Whitehead then significantly altered the previous designs and started to think about the problem of setting off explosive charges remotely below a ship's waterline, this being far more effective than above-water bombardment. Whitehead then made a device running under water and installed an engine running on compressed air, as well as automatic guidances for the depth and direction.\n\nOn 21 December 1866 the first automobile torpedo, now named \"Minenschiff\", was officially demonstrated in front of the Austro-Hungarian State Naval Commission for evaluation. This model was 355 mm in diameter and 3.35 m in length, weighing 136 kg with 8 kg of explosives. The naval commission accepted it, and subsequently on 6 March 1867 the government contracted the inventors for a test production and agreed to pay all the production costs.\n\nWhitehead retained the copyrights and even negotiated a new contract with Luppis. This however gave Whitehead full control of all future sales.\n\nOn 27 May 1867, the navy paid 200,000 forints in royalties to the inventor (Fiume being located in the Hungarian part of the Empire). The invention was generally regarded as a promising one, but in the first years of production there were not enough orders, so \"Stabilimento\" went through a crisis and went bankrupt in 1873. Whitehead then took it over and at the beginning of 1875 transformed it into a private company called 'Torpedo-Fabrik von Robert Whitehead'.\n\nGiovanni Luppis was given the noble title of Baron von Rammer ('the sinker') by Kaiser Franz Josef on 1 August 1869. He died in the borough (\"frazione\") of \"Torriggia\", in the municipality of Laglio, near Como on 11 January 1875.\n\n\n\n"}

In particular, the Stirling numbers of the first kind count permutations according to their number of cycles (counting fixed points as cycles of length one).\n\nThe original definition of Stirling numbers of the first kind was algebraic: they are the coefficients \"s\"(\"n\", \"k\") in the expansion of the falling factorial\n\ninto powers of the variable \"x\":\n\nFor example, formula_3, leading to the values formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6.\n\nSubsequently, it was discovered that the absolute values |\"s\"(\"n\", \"k\")| of these numbers are equal to the number of permutations of certain kinds. These absolute values, which are known as unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, are often denoted formula_7 or formula_8. They may be defined directly to be the number of permutations of \"n\" elements with \"k\" disjoint cycles. For example, of the formula_9 permutations of three elements, there is one permutation with three cycles (the identity permutation, given in one-line notation by formula_10 or in cycle notation by formula_11), three permutations with two cycles (formula_12, formula_13, and formula_14) and two permutations with one cycle (formula_15 and formula_16). Thus, formula_17, formula_18 and formula_19. These can be seen to agree with the previous calculation of formula_20 for formula_21.\n\nThe unsigned Stirling numbers may also be defined algebraically, as the coefficients of the rising factorial:\n\nThe notations used on this page for Stirling numbers are not universal, and may conflict with notations in other sources. (The square bracket notation formula_8 is also common notation for the Gaussian coefficients.)\n\nThe image at right shows that formula_24: the symmetric group on 4 objects has 3 permutations of the form\n\nand 8 permutations of the form\n\nThe signs of the (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind are predictable and depend on the parity of . In particular, \n\nThe unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind can be calculated by the recurrence relation\n\nfor formula_29, with the initial conditions\n\nfor \"n\" > 0.\n\nIt follows immediately that the (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind satisfy the recurrence\n\nThe coefficient of \"x\" on the left-hand side of this equation is formula_32. The coefficient of \"x\" in formula_33 is formula_34, while the coefficient of \"x\" in formula_35 is formula_36. Since the two sides are equal as polynomials, the coefficients of \"x\" on both sides must be equal, and the result follows.\n\n.</math>\n\nTo form a new permutation of \"n\" + 1 objects and \"k\" cycles one must insert the new object into this array. There are \"n\" ways to perform this insertion, inserting the new object immediately following any of the \"n\" already present. This explains the formula_37 term of the recurrence relation. These two cases include all possibilities, so the recurrence relation follows.\n\nBelow is a triangular array of unsigned values for the Stirling numbers of the first kind, similar in form to Pascal's triangle. These values are easy to generate using the recurrence relation in the previous section.\n\nNote that although\n\nand\n\nAlso\n\nand\n\nSimilar relationships involving the Stirling numbers hold for the Bernoulli polynomials. Many relations for the Stirling numbers shadow similar relations on the binomial coefficients. The study of these 'shadow relationships' is termed umbral calculus and culminates in the theory of Sheffer sequences. Generalizations of the Stirling numbers of both kinds to arbitrary complex-valued inputs may be extended through the relations of these triangles to the Stirling convolution polynomials.\n\nSince the Stirling numbers are the coefficients of a polynomial with roots 0, 1, ..., , one has by Vieta's formulas that\n\nformula_44\n\nIn other words, the Stirling numbers of the first kind are given by elementary symmetric polynomials evaluated at 0, 1, ..., . In this form, the simple identities given above take the form\n\nformula_45\nformula_46formula_47\nand so on.\n\nOne may produce alternative forms for the Stirling numbers of the first kind with a similar approach preceded by some algebraic manipulation: since\n\nit follows from Newton's formulas that one can expand the Stirling numbers of the first kind in terms of generalized harmonic numbers. This yields identities like\n\nwhere \"H\" is the harmonic number formula_52 and \"H\" is the generalized harmonic number\nformula_53\n\nThese relations can be generalized to give\nwhere \"w\"(\"n\", \"m\") is defined recursively in terms of the generalized harmonic numbers by\n\nFor fixed formula_57 these weighted harmonic number expansions are generated by the generating function\n\nwhere the notation formula_59 means extraction of the coefficient of formula_60 from the following formal power series (see the non-exponential Bell polynomials and section 3 of ).\n\nMore generally, sums related to these weighted harmonic number expansions of the Stirling numbers of the first kind can be defined through generalized zeta series transforms of generating functions.\n\nOne can also \"invert\" the relations for these Stirling numbers given in terms of the formula_61-order harmonic numbers to write the integer-order generalized harmonic numbers in terms of weighted sums of terms involving the Stirling numbers of the first kind.

Several particular finite sums relevant to this article include\n\nOther finite sum identities involving the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind found, for example, in the \"NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions\" (Section 26.8) include the following sums:\n\nAdditionally, if we define the \"second-order\" Eulerian numbers by the triangular recurrence relation \n\nwe arrive at the following identity related to the form of the Stirling convolution polynomials which can be employed to generalize both Stirling number triangles to arbitrary real, or complex-valued, values of the input formula_86:\n\nParticular expansions of the previous identity lead to the following identities expanding the Stirling numbers of the first kind for the first few small values of formula_140:\n\nSoftware tools for working with finite sums involving Stirling numbers and Eulerian numbers are provided by the RISC Stirling.m package utilities in \"Mathematica\". Other software packages for \"guessing\" formulas for sequences (and polynomial sequence sums) involving Stirling numbers and other special triangles is available for both Mathematica and Sage here and here, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, infinite series involving the finite sums with the Stirling numbers often lead to the special functions. For example\n\nformula_142\n\nor\n\nformula_143\n\nand\n\nformula_144\n\nor even\n\nformula_145\n\nwhere \"γ\" are the Stieltjes constants and \"δ\" represents the Kronecker delta function.\n\nThe Stirling number \"s(n,n-p)\" can be found from the formula\nwhere formula_147 The sum is a sum over all partitions of \"p\".\n\nAnother exact nested sum expansion for these Stirling numbers is computed by elementary symmetric polynomials corresponding to the coefficients in formula_86 of a product of the form formula_149. In particular, we see that\n\nNewton's identities combined with the above expansions may be used to give an alternate proof of the weighted expansions involving the generalized harmonic numbers already noted above.\n\nAnother explicit formula for reciprocal powers of \"n\" is given by the following identity for integers formula_151:\n\nNotice that this last identity immediately implies relations between the polylogarithm functions, the Stirling number exponential generating functions given above, and the Stirling-number-based power series for the generalized Nielsen polylogarithm functions.\n\nThe \"n\"th derivative of the \"μ\"th power of the natural logarithm involves the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind:\n\nformula_153\n\nwhere formula_154is the falling factorial, and formula_155is the signed Stirling number.\n\nIt can be proved by using mathematical induction.\n\nThere are many notions of \"generalized Stirling numbers\" that may be defined (depending on application) in a number of differing combinatorial contexts. In so much as the Stirling numbers of the first kind correspond to the coefficients of the distinct polynomial expansions of the single factorial function, formula_156, we may extend this notion to define triangular recurrence relations for more general classes of products.\n\nIn particular, for any fixed arithmetic function formula_157 and symbolic parameters formula_158, related generalized factorial products of the form\n\nmay be studied from the point of view of the classes of generalized Stirling numbers of the first kind defined by the following coefficients of the powers of formula_86 in the expansions of formula_161 and then by the next corresponding triangular recurrence relation:\n\nThese coefficients satisfy a number of analogous properties to those for the Stirling numbers of the first kind as well as recurrence relations and functional equations related to the \"f-harmonic numbers\", formula_163.\n\nOne special case of these bracketed coefficients corresponding to formula_164 allows us to expand the multiple factorial, or multifactorial functions as polynomials in formula_99 (see generalizations of the double factorial).\n\nThe Stirling numbers of both kinds, the binomial coefficients, and the first and second-order Eulerian numbers are all defined by special cases of a triangular \"super-recurrence\" of the form\n\nfor integers formula_167 and where formula_168 whenever formula_169 or formula_170.

Two towns have existed in Union Grove township: 1) the unincorporated community Union Grove, established in 1857 and 2) the former town of Williamsburg established in 1812. The Union Grove Post Office was established in 1857. In 2019, within the unincorporated town of Union Grove is the Union Grove Milling Company, Union Grove School (formerly Union Grove elementary through high school), Union Grove Volunteer Fire House, and two Methodist churches. In the later half of the 20th century, Union Grove was famous for the Fiddler's Convention which was held in Union Grove from the 1920s to 1970s. The Fiddler's Convention was originally established to benefit the Union Grove school. \n\nUnion Grove Township is located on a scenic spot with a view of the Blue Ridge, Brushy Mountains, and the pinnacle of Pilot Mountain some 60 miles away. The center of the town of Union Grove is located at (36.024400, -80.86639). The center of Union Grove township is located at 36.00867730, -80.85436970. Union Grove Township is in the north-central area of Iredell County. It is bordered by Eagle Mills Township to the east, New Hope Township to the west, Olin Township and Turnersburg Township to the south, and Yadkin County and Wilkes County to the north.\n\nInterstate 77 runs north south and North Carolina Highway 901 runs east–west through the township.\n\nBodies of water flowing through Union Grove Township include Hunting Creek, Rocky Creek, Owens Branch, Camel Branch, and Brushy Creek.\n\nThe area that is now Union Grove Township was first settled in the late 1700s. Early settlers included Campbell, Mullis, Morgan, Howard, and Tutterow families. The first town in the area was Williamsburg, which had a post office from 18121827 and from 18321905 with the name Williamsburgh.\nPost offices were used to designate persons in the 1860 U.S. Federal Census. The area that became Union Grove Township in 1868 included the census districts north and south of Hunting Creek in Iredell County. This area included the following post offices: Williamsburg, Union Grove, Houstonville, and Eagle Mills post offices. Houstonville and Eagle Mills would become part of Eagle Mills Township. Before the U.S. Civil War, Union Grove was the largest town in this area. The Union Grove post office was called Craters Mills until December 21, 1857. John Templeton was postmaster of Craters Mills from September 17, 1851 until December 21, 1857. The following table shows the breakout of the population of these towns in June 1860: \n\nThe inhabitants of the area that became Union Grove in the early 1800s and Union Grove Township in 1868 were farmers and some also ran mills. By 1850, some farms grew larger, as evidence by the number of slaves and size of the families. In 1850, Perciphull Campbell owned 21 slaves. In 1860, Hosea Redman on Rocky Creek owned 30 slaves. After the Civil War, the 1870 Census shows that there were only 70 \"colored\" men and women out of a total population of 1,034 in Union Grove Township. There was only one foreign born resident in 1870, a farmer's wife from England named Sophia Low. There were 281 inhabitants in the U.S. Census of 1860, including 242 in district North of Rocky Creek-Union Grove post office area and 39 in the Williamsburg district-Williamsburg post office area. \nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,069 people, 775 households, and 579 families residing in the Union Grove township. There were 849 housing units at an average density of 57/sq mi (147.6/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 92.2% White, 3.2% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.5% Asian, <1% Pacific Islander, 3.4% from other races, and 0.5% from two or more races. 5.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\n\nThere were 775 households out of which 74.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.8% were married couples living together, 8.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.3% were non-families. 36.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.02.\n\nIn the township the population was spread out with 24.2% under the age of 18, 7.6% from 18 to 24, 30% from 25 to 44, 24.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38.0 years. For every 100 females, there were 104 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 101 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $43,284, and the median income for a family was $46,134. Males had a median income of $31,906 versus $24,340 for females. The per capita income for the town was $18,321. About 4.8% of families and 8.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.2% of those under age 18 and 22.2% of those age 65 or over.\n\nThe area that is now Union Grove Township was a favorite spot with the Indians before early settlers. Many Indian artifacts have been found in the area, especially a site near Jennings mill known as Indian Hill.\n\nSeveral mills were built on the Hunting Creek in the south and Rocky Creek in the north, the two main streams in Union Grove Township. The mills were used as both a grist mill and saw mill. Mills in the area included the following:\nSevere flooding in the area in 1848 left only three mills in operation in North Iredell County, the Campbell mill on Rocky Creek, the Jennings mill, and the Diffy mill.\n\nThe community churches grew up around the mills, two towns, and concentration of inhabitants. The following churches are within Union Grove township:\nThe earliest known store in the area was operated on the John Howard farm, two miles north of Union Grove, by Jacob Fraley. Prior to the Civil War, Mr Fraley moved his store to Union Grove. Jesse E. Fraley and John A. Fraley operated a store in Union Grove around 1844. Jacob Fraley was Postmaster of the Union Grove Post Office on December 21, 1857.\n\nBy the requirements of the North Carolina Constitution of 1868, the county was divided into townships. Previous to that time, the subdivisions were Captain's Districts. While the Captain's Districts referred primarily to the militia, it served also for the election precinct, the tax listing and tax collecting district. Union Grove Township was named after the Union Grove postoffice in the center of that township. Union Grove Township has been used since 1870 as a census district.\n\nThe longest operating commercial activity in the area is the Jenning store, which is located one and one-half miles south of Union Grove. This store was originally operated by Rev. Quentin Holton about 1850. In 1886, Mr. John Myers and the Rev. T.L. Jennings founded a mercantile business on this site. Rev. Jennings son, J.T. Jennings, purchased the store from his father.\n\nIn the later 1800s or early 1900s, Union Grove citizens founded the Union Grove School. The earliest records show that in 1905 the average attendance was 50. There was only one teacher and the salary for one month was thirty dollars. The first schoolhouse was a one-room frame building. For the first time, the Union Grove school opened on September 14, 1925 with 67 high school students. The high school continued until 1966 when high schools in Iredell County where consolidated. The elementary and junior high students remained at Union Grove School, until 1991, when a consolidated middle school opened.\n\nThe Union Grove Old Time Fiddlers' Convention founded in 1924 by H. P. VanHoy and friends, as a fund raiser for the school. Held annually on the school grounds every Easter weekend, the Fiddlers' Convention was a popular community event that brought many area old-time fiddlers into the small unincorporated town of Union Grove to compete. With the folk music revival in the 1950s and 1960s, however, this small-town community event became increasingly popular with young people who would travel great distances to attend. The unconventional lifestyles of some of these young people disturbed many residents of the conservative farming community. The \"Woodstock generation\" generated huge crowds to Union Grove, thus overwhelming the community's resources. After the 1969 Convention (and after Woodstock) the county school board asked that the event be moved off school grounds. Thus the decision on where to relocate the Fiddlers' Convention came down to the two sons of H. P. VanHoy. Pierce VanHoy was the oldest son and program director of the Convention. Harper VanHoy (younger brother) was the Secretary and Treasurer. They disagreed on how to proceed and thus, went their separate ways creating two distinct \"Fiddlers' Conventions.\"\n\nFiddler's Grove, an old-time-music and family-oriented campground, was developed on land purchased near the school by Harper Van Hoy and his wife, Wanona, in 1970. From the beginning, Fiddler's Grove was envisioned as the site for the annual fiddling competition. Central entertainment events at Fiddler's Grove have been the Old Time Fiddler's & Bluegrass Festival, a spring fiddling competition held annually since 1970, and the Square-Up, a fall clogging dance competition held until 1982.\n\nPierce Van Hoy was the program director and the main promoter of the Convention. He felt that it should be promoted as their father, the founder, intended. He held his event on his farm and retained the original name of \"World's Championship Old-Time Fiddlers' Convention,\" with the blessings and support of their father. Financially committed to Fiddler's Grove, Harper Van Hoy felt it was important to focus on the music and the community by creating a family atmosphere and enforcing a ban on alcohol and illegal drugs. He called his event the Old Time Fiddler's & Bluegrass Festival and received early support from Doc Watson, Lee and Jean Shilling, Alan Jabbour, and Allein Stanley, JP Fraley, and Fred Coon, among others. While the World's Championship Old-Time Fiddlers Convention attracted large crowds and was immediately financially successful, Harper Van Hoy's Ole Time Fiddler's & Bluegrass Festival deliberately stayed small, despite early financial losses, by implementing an invitation-only attendance policy in 1973. Both fiddling events were held simultaneously in Union Grove over Easter weekends. After newspaper accounts erroneously reported drug-related incidents and other problems occurring at the Old Time Fiddler's & Bluegrass Festival instead of the World's Championship Old-Time Fiddlers Convention, Harper Van Hoy moved his festival to Memorial Day weekend in 1974 to distance it from his brother's festival.\n\nFiddler's Grove continued to host the Old Time Fiddler's & Bluegrass Festival on Memorial Day weekend along with a number of other events. The Festival's commitment to the preservation and perpetuation of old-time music is particularly reflected in its special competition categories of Certified Old-Time Fiddler (fiddlers 55 years and older who play strictly by ear with no formal violin training) and Heritage Tune (in which the fiddler must not only perform but tell the origin and story of an old tune). The Square-Up, an annual dance competition, held over Labor Day weekend was an institution at Fiddler's Grove until 1982. This dance competition featured traditional mountain, precision, and smooth clogging teams as well as individual buck and flatfoot dancers. Fiddler's Grove and the Old Time Fiddler's & Bluegrass Festival were nominated in the Local Legacy category by Senator Jesse Helms as part of the Library of Congress Bicentennial in 2000.\n\nThe Pierce VanHoy farm was acquired by Casey VanHoy (the late Pierce VanHoy's youngest son) and converted into an entertainment facility and RV Park - The VanHoy Farms Family Campground. In 2012, Casey decided to restart the World's Championship Old-Time Fiddlers' Convention, under the name Union Grove Fiddlers' Convention. The convention was a success - thus returning to its pre - \"Woodstock generation\" days, with a much smaller family oriented setting.\n\n"}
{"id": "2229306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229306", "title": "Reginald Hall", "text": "Reginald Hall\n\nAdmiral Sir William Reginald Hall (28 June 1870 – 22 October 1943), known as Blinker Hall, was the British Director of Naval Intelligence (DNI) from 1914 to 1919. Together with Sir Alfred Ewing he was responsible for the establishment of the Royal Navy's codebreaking operation, Room 40, which decoded the Zimmermann telegram, a major factor in the entry of the United States in World War I.\n\nReginald Hall was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, eldest son of Captain William Henry Hall, the first head of Naval Intelligence, who married the daughter of the reverend George Armfield from Armley, Leeds. Hall decided on a naval career for himself when taken on a cruise on board by his father. He joined the training ship HMS \"Britannia\" in 1884 and two years later was appointed to the armoured cruiser \"Northampton\". After a year he was transferred to the ironclad battleship \"Bellerophon\" which was part of the North American Station. In 1889 he became acting sub-lieutenant before attending courses for his Lieutenants examinations at Greenwich, the gunnery school and torpedo school where he achieved first class grades in all five of the subjects. Now as Lieutenant he was posted to the China Station where he served on the flagship, the armoured cruiser \"Imperieuse\". In 1892 he was recommended to train as a gunnery officer, which involved a course in mathematics at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, followed by a year's course at the gunnery school at HMS \"Excellent\", a shore establishment at Whale Island, Portsmouth. Having qualified, he remained for a year on the staff.\n\nIn 1894 Hall married Ethel Wootton de Wiveslie Abney, daughter of Sir William. The engagement had begun when he was aged 19, five years before, but at the time this was still considered a young age for a naval officer to get married. In 1895 he was appointed as gunnery lieutenant on the cruiser \"Australia\" where he served for two years before being appointed to the senior staff at Whale Island. He was promoted to commander 1 January 1901, in recognition of services with naval forces in South Africa, and later served on the battleship \"Magnificent\", flagship of the second in command of the Channel Fleet.\n\nIn 1904 he became commander of the predreadnought battleship \"Cornwallis\" which was commissioning with a new crew to operate in the Mediterranean. Hall had a reputation as a strict disciplinarian with an ability to get the best out of a crew, so he was given some of the worst sailors to bring up to scratch. A trick of disaffected sailors was to remove gunsights and throw them overboard, and indeed this happened. Hall instructed the master at arms to look out for two sailors who had previously been friends but who now avoided each other. He took one, told him that the other had confessed they had removed the sights, and the sailor duly confessed. Behaviour on board improved. Although Hall imposed discipline strictly, he also showed concern for the men he commanded and for their welfare, which was unusual for that time. He took particular care for the boys and junior seamen.\n\nIn December 1905 he was promoted to Captain and appointed by the First Sea Lord, Sir John Fisher as Inspecting Captain of the new Mechanical Training Establishments, which Fisher had established to give engineering training to ordinary sailors (1906-7). He was next appointed captain of the cadet training ship HMS \"Cornwall\". Although not a conventional warship, this now involved Hall in intelligence work. The ship visited foreign ports, particularly in Germany which was now seen as the navy's greatest potential enemy, and Hall started the tour with a long list of places to investigate. In Kiel he was tasked with discovering how many slips had been constructed for building large vessels. To do this he devised a ruse with the help of the Duke of Westminster, who was visiting the port and agreed to lend his motor boat for the task. Hall and a couple of officers dressed down as sailors and took the yacht on a full speed circuit of the harbour, pretending to break down by the naval dockyard. A concealed camera was then used to take photographs of the installations. More information was discovered by careful questions ashore.\n\nIn 1910 two officers, Lieutenant Brandon and Captain Trench, who had been part of Hall's crew gathering intelligence were sent on a 'holiday' in Germany to collect information about coastal defences by Captain Regnart of the intelligence division. The two were captured and served two and a half years of a four-year sentence, before being pardoned in May 1913 as part of a visit by King George V to Germany. The admiralty then denied any responsibility for what had happened to the pair and their considerable financial loss as a result. When appointed director of intelligence, Hall arranged for them to be compensated.\n\nHall was appointed to the armoured cruiser \"Natal\" following the death of her captain, F.C.A. Ogilvy. Ogilvy had obtained a high reputation for his ship which had beaten all records at gunnery but Hall managed to step into Ogilvy's place, retaining the confidence of the crew and bettering the gunnery record the following year. His reputation for unorthodox treatment of his men continued to grow, making it his business to reform recalcitrant sailors rather than simply punishing them. He had the knack of threatening men with punishments he could not deliver (such as dismissal from the service) if they did not reform, and succeeded. \"Natal\" was called upon to assist a sailing ship, the \"Celtic Race\", which had lost most of her sails in a storm and was in danger of sinking. Despite the risk to his own ship, he escorted \"Celtic Race\" into Milford Haven. He was rewarded by the owners and underwriters, being presented with a silver table centrepiece by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool on their behalf.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1913 he served as assistant to the Controller of the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1913 he became captain of the battle cruiser \"Queen Mary\". When he took over he was asked to take part in an experiment by the admiralty to dispense with ships police, transferring their duties to petty officers. He also introduced an innovation of his own, to divide the ship's crew into three watches rather than the customary two. Hall believed that in the war with Germany which he expected, it would be impossible to run a ship continuously with just two watches. The change attracted much ridicule but when war came it was adopted on all large ships. A religious man, he arranged that a chapel was provided on board the ship, and this innovation too was adopted generally. He felt it important that the authority of petty officers should be boosted, and he did this by improving their quarters. He arranged for washing machines on board, for the convenience of the officers who no longer had to pay for laundry ashore, and to the benefit of sailors who were 'tipped' to carry out the washing. He introduced a bookstore on board, and the navy's first shipboard cinema. Inadequacies in the water supply meant that it took an hour for all the stokers to finish washing after duty. Hall insisted that his engineers find a solution to provide enough hot water that they could all wash in 15 minutes, giving them more free time. These changes too became standard. Hall was criticised for being too soft with his crews, but his requirements for discipline were not relaxed. Rather, he believed that reward was necessary as well as punishment. Living conditions in society were improving generally and he believed the navy must keep pace with standards ashore.\n\n\"Queen Mary\" took part in the battlecruiser squadron's visit to Cronstadt, where the fleet officers and sailors were entertained by the Russian royal family, and a lavish ball was held on board ship as the culmination of the visit. It was the last such visit before World War I commenced and the battlecruisers transferred to their initial wartime base at Scapa Flow. Ships spent large amounts of time at sea, before the strategic situation became clearer and the fear of immediate German raids diminished. \"Queen Mary\" took part in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, where the battlecruisers were called upon to support a raid by destroyers and cruisers against German patrol ships operating off Heligoland. The raid was hailed as a British success, although behind the scenes it was marred by poor communications between the British forces involved.\n\nHall's health had deteriorated under the stress of continuous sea service, and after three months matters had reached the point where he was obliged to request posting away from the ship.\n\nHis seagoing career cut short by ill-health, Hall was appointed Director of the Intelligence Division (DID) by the Admiralty in October 1914, replacing Captain Henry Oliver. According to Oliver, Hall's wife wrote to him on behalf of her husband requesting that he replace Oliver in the Intelligence Division. Hall served as DID (the title eventually reverted to the pre-1911 \"DNI\") until January 1919 when he retired from active duty. It turned out to be a fortunate appointment, for he was responsible for building up the naval intelligence organization during the war, encouraged codebreaking and radio-intercept efforts and provided the fleet with good intelligence, making the NID the pre-eminent British intelligence agency during the war. He also encouraged cooperation with other British intelligence organizations, such as MI5 (under Vernon Kell), MI6 (under Mansfield Smith-Cumming) and the Special Branch of Scotland Yard (under Basil Thomson).\n\nThanks to intercepts from Room 40, Hall was instrumental in the interception of the steamer \"Aud\" on 21 April 1916 by HMS \"Bluebell\", which was carrying German arms to Ireland. That morning the man who had organised the arms shipment, Sir Roger Casement, was arrested in Tralee Bay after disembarking from a German U-Boat. Hall was aware of the upcoming Easter Rising in Dublin, but refused to reveal his sources, so that when information of the rising did reach the government, its authenticity was questioned. Hall interrogated Casement and allegedly refused Casement the opportunity of making a public demand for the cancellation of the uprising.\n\nWhen the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Germany, intercepted traffic between the US German legation and Berlin dried up as a key source of British intelligence. Less reliable information was used by intelligence chiefs including Admiral Hall, such as 'spy-obsessed loyalist residents in Ireland.' The mass arrests of known Sinn Féin activists, following the discovery of a spurious 'German Plot' in Ireland has been interpreted as:\n\na striking illustration of the apparent manipulation of intelligence in order to prod the Irish authorities into more forceful action...when the British Government was unable to provide convincing evidence of a 'German Plot', nationalist Ireland concluded that it had been invented as retribution for the defeat of conscription.'\n\nIn this analysis Irish public opinion was wrong. Based on the faulty intelligence information made available to them, 'British ministers sincerely believed the threat was real'.\n\nRoom 40's decryptions also led to the capture of Captain Franz von Rintelen, a German Naval Intelligence officer who had firebombed munitions ships and factories in the neutral United States.\n\nIn 1917, Hall was awarded the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, which represents the second highest of eight classes associated with the award. In that same year, he was promoted to rear-admiral. He was knighted in 1918 and was promoted to vice-admiral in 1922 and to full admiral in 1926, both on the retired list.\n\nUpon retirement Hall served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool West Derby from 1919 to 1923, then for Eastbourne 1925–1929. As an MP, in 1919 he and a group of industrialists founded a group to counter subversive actions against free enterprise known as National Propaganda, which was later renamed the Economic League. Even in the House of Commons he was still said to be involved in the Zinoviev letter affair in 1924, which led to the victory of the Conservatives in the general election of that year. In the 1920s and 1930s he travelled extensively in the United States to give lectures on intelligence gathering matters. Too old to return to active service on the outbreak of World War II, Hall nevertheless served in the British Home Guard until his death.\n\nDespite his retirement from military on political life Hall by the late 1930s had been identified as an important target person by the National Socialist police apparatus: In early 1940 the Reichssicherheitshauptamt in Berlin, the headquarters of the intelligence service of the SS, added his name to the Sonderfahndungsliste G.B., a list of people residing in the UK, whom the Nazi leadership and/or its intelligence service regarded as particularly important or (from their point of view) dangerous and who for that reason were slated to be tracked down and apprehended with heightened priority by special task forces of the SS, that were to follow on the heels of the occupying forces in case of a successful invasion of the British islands by the Wehrmacht.\n\nHall was described by the U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James's Walter Page as a \"clear case of genius\", while American attaché Edward Bell described him as \"a perfectly marvelous person but the coldest-hearted proposition that ever was – he'd eat a man's heart and hand it back to him.\"\n\nHe was known as \"Blinker\" on account of a chronic facial twitch, which caused one of his eyes to \"flash like a Navy signal lamp\". His daughter attributed this to childhood malnutrition. (He had attended a military boarding school in which the boys had to fill their bellies by stealing turnips from neighbouring farms). Today, such a twitch is also thought to be symptomatic of a mild form of Dyspraxia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2229320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229320", "title": "Saint Alphonsa", "text": "Saint Alphonsa\n\nSaint Alphonsa, F.C.C., (born Anna Muttathupadathu; 19 August 1910 – 28 July 1946) was an Indian religious sister and educator. She was the first woman of Indian origin to be canonised as a saint by the Catholic Church, and the first canonised saint of the Syro-Malabar Church, an Eastern Catholic Church based in Kerala. Her feast day is observed on 28 July.\n\nSt Alphonsa was born as Anna Muttathupadathu in a Syro-Malabar Nasrani family to Cherian Ouseph and Mary Muttathupadathu in Kudamalloor, near Kottayam, on 19 August 1910. She was baptised on 27 August. \"Alphonsamma\", as she was locally known, was born in Arpookara, a village in the princely state of Travancore within Kerala, India. This lies within the Archdiocese of Changanassery.\n\nHer parents nicknamed her \"Annakkutty\" (little Anna). She had a difficult childhood and experienced loss and suffering early on in life. Anna's mother died when she was young, so her maternal aunt raised her. Hagiographies describe her early life as one of suffering at the hands of her stern foster mother and the teasing of schoolchildren. Anna was educated by her great-uncle, Father Joseph Muttathupadathu. When Anna was three-years-old, she contracted eczema and suffered for over a year.\n\nIn 1916 Anna started school in Arpookara. She received her First Communion on 27 November 1917. When the first school cycle ended in 1920, the time had come to transfer to Muttuchira, to the house of her aunt Anna Murickan, to whom her mother, before she died, had entrusted her as her adoptive mother. She was raised in murickan family, which was an ancient and prominent family. Anna received many marriage proposals from reputed families. During that period Theresa of Lisieux appeared and told her that she will become a saint. There are many similarities in the life of Anna and Theresa, and she was Anna's all-time favorite person and role model.\n\nAnna sacrificed her material fortune and wanted to dedicate her life to Jesus Christ. In 1923, Anna's feet were burnt when she fell into a pit of burning chaff; local hagiographies describe this as a self-inflicted injury in order to avoid her foster mother's attempt to arrange a marriage for her and thereby to fulfill her desire for becoming a Religious Sister instead. This accident left her partially disabled for the rest of her life.\n\nWhen it became possible, Anna joined the Franciscan Clarist Congregation, a religious congregation of the Third Order of St. Francis, and through them, completed her schooling.\n\nAnna arrived at the Clarist convent at Bharananganam, Kottayam district, on Pentecost Sunday 1927. She received the postulant's veil on 2 August 1928 and took the name Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception in honour of St. Alphonsus Ligouri, whose feast day it was. In May 1929 Sister Alphonsa was assigned to teach at Malayalam High School at Vazhappally. Her foster mother died in 1930. She resumed her studies at Changanacherry, while working as a temporary teacher at a school at Vakakkad. On 19 May 1930 Alphonsa entered the novitiate of the congregation at Bharananganam. On 11 August 1931 she completed the novitiate and took her first vows. And became a religious in the catholic church.\n\nThe period 1930–1935 was characterised by grave illness. Sister Alphonsa took her permanent vows on 12 August 1936. Two days later she returned to Bharananganam from Changanacherry. She then taught high school at St. Alphonsa Girl's High School, but was often sick and unable to teach. For most of her years as a Clarist Sister she endured serious illness.\n\nIn December 1936, it is claimed that she was cured from her ailments through the intervention of the Kuriakose Elias Chavara (who was beatified at the same ceremony as she), but on 14 June 1939 she was struck by a severe attack of pneumonia which left her weakened. On 18 October 1940, a thief entered her room in the middle of the night. This traumatic event caused her to suffer amnesia and weakened her again.\n\nHer health continued to deteriorate over a period of months. She received extreme unction on 29 September 1941. The next day it is believed that she regained her memory, though not complete health. Her health improved over the next few years, until in July 1945 she developed gastroenteritis and liver problems that caused violent convulsions and vomiting. During the last year of her life she came to know Father Sebastian Valopilly (later Bishop of Kerala) who frequently brought her communion. This bishop became famous in Kerala for championing the cause of poor people from all religious backgrounds who had come to live in Thalassery as a result of shortages elsewhere.\n\nAfter a series of serious health problems, she died on 28 July 1946, at a young age of 35. She was buried at St. Mary's Catholic Church, Bharananganam, Travancore (present day (Kottayam) in the Diocese of Palai.\n\nClaims of her miraculous intervention began almost immediately upon her death and often involved the children of the convent school where she used to teach. On 2 December 1953, Cardinal Eugène Tisserant inaugurated the diocesan process for her beatification and Alphonsa was declared a Servant of God.\n\nIn 1985, Pope John Paul II formally approved a miracle attributed to her intercession and on 9 July she became \"Venerable Sister Alphonsa\".\n\nVenerable Sister Alphonsa was beatified along with Father Kuriakose Elias Chavara, T.O.C.D., at Kottayam, on 8 February 1986 by Pope John Paul II during his Apostolic Pilgrimage to India.\n\nDuring his speech at Nehru Stadium, the Pope said:\n\nHundreds of miraculous cures are claimed from her intervention, many of them involving straightening of clubbed feet, possibly because of her having lived with deformed feet herself. Two of these cases were submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints as proof of her miraculous intervention. The continuing cures are chronicled in the magazine \"PassionFlower\".\n\nBishop Sebastian reported: About ten years ago, when I was in a small village in Wayanad outside Manatavady, I saw a boy walking with some difficulty, using a stick. As he approached me I noted that both of his feet were turned upside down. I had a stack of holy cards in my pocket with Alphonsa's picture on them, so I pulled one of them out and gave it to the boy. When I told the boy that he should pray to this woman for the cure of his feet, the boy – he was quite smart for a ten-year-old boy – replied: \"But I'm a Muslim, and, besides, I was born this way.\" I replied that God is very powerful, so let's pray. A few months later, a boy and a gentleman appeared at the house here. I didn't recognize them at first but soon learned that it was the Muslim boy with his father, here to tell me that his feet had been cured through their prayers to Sister Alphonsa. They showed me the calluses on the tops of his feet, and you could see the marks which had been made from the years of his walking with his feet turned under. Before they left, the three of us had our pictures taken.\n\nThe boy had reportedly taken Alphonsa's picture card and asked Alphonsa to help fix his feet. Several days afterwards one of his feet supposedly turned around. He and the other members of his family then prayed for the cure of the second foot, which also supposedly turned around later.\n\nOn Sunday, 12 October 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced her canonization at a ceremony at Saint Peter's Square. Indians from across the world, especially people from Kerala, gathered at the ceremony in Rome. Among them was a 10-year-old Kerala boy Jinil Joseph whose clubfoot – a birth defect – was, in the judgment of Vatican officials, miraculously healed after prayers to Alphonsa in 1999.\n\nThe final ceremony for the canonization began with the holy relics of Alphonsa being presented to the Pope by Sister Celia, Mother General of the Franciscan Clarist Congregation, the congregation to which Sister Alphonsa belonged. Sister Celia was accompanied by Vice Postulator Father Francis Vadakkel and former Kerala minister K. M. Mani, all holding lit candles. Speaking in English, the Pope declared Sister Alphonsa a saint, after reading excerpts from the Bible. The Pope himself read out the biography of Alphonsa after the ceremony.\n\nIn the homily, Pope Benedict XVI recalled Saint Alphonsa's life as one of \"extreme physical and spiritual suffering\".\n\n\"(Her) heroic virtues of patience, fortitude and perseverance in the midst of deep suffering remind us that God always provides the strength we need to overcome every trial,\" the pope stated before the ceremony ended.\n\nThe canonization was greeted with the bursting of firecrackers and the toll of church bells. St Mary's Forane church at Kudmaloor, her home parish, also celebrated a special Mass. The grave at St Mary's Forane Church in Bharananganam where the Franciscan Clarist Sister was buried had a chapel built there, which houses her mortal remains.\n\nReserve bank of India Issued a 5 Rupees Commemorative Coin in 2009 marking the birth centenary of Saint Alphonsa.\n\nHer tomb at St. Mary's Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Bharananganam, has become a pilgrimage site as miracles have been reported by some of the faithful.\n\nSt. Alphonsa Church Valiyakolly is known as the \"Bharanaganam of North Kerala\" (unofficial). This church is under the diocese of Thamarassery. Valiyakolly church is the first church named after St. Alphonsa in the diocese. And hence this church is one of the main pilgrimage centres of St. Alphonsa in North Kerala. Novena on the name of St. Alphonsa is being conducted here on every Friday evening\n\nThousands of people converge on the small town of Bharananganam when they celebrate the feast of Saint Alphonsa from 19 to 28 July each year; her tomb has been designated as a pilgrimage site with numerous miracles being reported by pious devotees.\n\n\n"}

It was shot in Technicolor and was released on May 20, 1953. This film tells the story of two engineers drilling for oil in the Louisiana gulf while dealing with hostility of the local shrimp fishermen fearing for their livelihood and features the first non-western collaboration between Stewart and Mann.\n\nPenniless but full of ideas, Steve Martin (James Stewart) and Johnny Gambi (Dan Duryea), engineers who served in the Navy during World War II, walk down a quiet road on the gulf coast of Louisiana. Teche Bossier (Gilbert Roland), owner of the Port Felicity Fish Co., agrees to drive them into the shrimping town Port Felicity for five dollars. Upon reaching their destination, Gambi rents a shrimp boat from Dominique Rigaud (Antonio Moreno), although the fisherman's daughter Stella (Joanne Dru) distrusts them immediately.\n\nGambi and Steve use the boat to show potential investor Kermit MacDonough (Jay C. Flippen) the location in which they plan to drill for offshore oil. Claiming that he has designed a drilling platform that can withstand any storm, Steve estimates that by investing one million dollars now, they will soon tap an oil reserve worth two billion. His enthusiasm is so infectious that MacDonough agrees to fund the project against the advice of his secretary, Rawlins. However, MacDonough warns Steve that he must discover oil within three months, or his company, due to huge investments made in an offshore oil lease, will put them both out of work.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Gambi meets and falls for Stella's younger sister Francesca (Marcia Henderson), but according to custom, she has been betrothed since childhood to Philippe Bayard. After singing a love song in the local gathering place Bon Chance, Philippe is upset to see Francesca enter with Gambi. Teche, who good-naturedly calls the oilmen \"foreigners,\" agrees to help Steve and Gambi, but Stella refuses to accept Steve's statement that oil will be good for the town, claiming that she learned about \"their kind\" during her stay in Chicago. Nevertheless, the outsiders hire a crew and begin their search for oil.\n\nWhen Teche sees dynamite charges being dropped into the gulf, he begs them to stop, believing that the explosions will kill the shrimp and worsen an already dismal shrimping season. Steve maintains that the charges are safe, but Teche returns to town and incites the fishermen to form an angry mob. He scares the mob away by exploding sticks of dynamite behind them and he placates Stella by warning Gambi to stay away from Francesca. Steve gently advises Francesca to \"go back to [her] people.\"\n\nWith one month gone, Steve drives the building crew relentlessly and the platform and rig are completed on-schedule. He immediately orders the drilling crew to get started and the exhausted Gambi is relieved when a hurricane warning gives the men an excuse to take the night off. Gambi and his men enter the Bon Chance with Francesca, and Philippe furiously punches his rival and starts a brawl. The sheriff arrests the oilmen and Francesca angrily denounces all the men.\n\nDuring the storm, Stella visits Steve at the rig, determined to have Gambi fired so he stops seeing her sister. Steve explains to Stella that if he could pull up a resource that has been in the earth for millions of years, then he will truly have accomplished something. Stella finally abandons her suspicion and kisses Steve, but back in town, Philippe persuades Teche to help him destroy the oil rig. With the hurricane winds rising, Philippe climbs onto the platform and lights a bundle of dynamite, but Steve sees him and the two men fight. Philippe trips and disappears under the waves, and Steve, horrified, assumes that Stella was involved in Philippe's plot.\n\nThe rig survives the storm, and in the morning, drilling begins. However, eight days before the deadline, MacDonough visits Steve and sadly delivers the news that the board of his company has voted to stop the drilling operation on the following day, fearing a penalty for non-payment on their lease. MacDonough has already spent all of his own money and the crew is unable to work for no pay. Gambi soon returns from town, announcing that he has just married Francesca. Steve punches Gambi, who in retort loudly chastises Steve for having driven him and the men too hard. Steve tells them all to leave, intending to do the drilling himself, whereupon Gambi hesitates and then persuades the crew to remain. While the men are drilling, they discover that the troublesome shrimp that have been clogging the valves are actually the huge golden shrimp that have so long eluded the local fishermen.\n\nSteve later takes Francesca to the rig, infuriating Dominique, who inflames the fisherman by declaring that the oilmen will steal their daughters and destroy the town. At Stella's request, Teche go to warn Steve about the impending mob on its way to the rig. There, Steve feigns ignorance about the golden shrimp and asks Teche if he can help him get rid of the creatures. He then addresses the furious mob to assure the men on their concerns: Francesca's marriage is a happy one and moreover, oil will bring progress to Port Felicity. Despite these words, the mob decides to destroy the structure, but at that moment, oil explodes through the rig and onto the platform. Later on, the fishermen discover that the golden shrimp bed is huge, and consequently, the conflict between the oilmen and the fishermen is resolved. Teche then convinces Steve that Stella was not involved in Philippe's plot and the lovers finally come together.\n\n\nProduction for this film started from late September to mid-November 1952. It was filmed in 1.37:1 full frame aspect ratio while it was released in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen.\n\nThe film was Universal-International's first with stereophonic sound. It was also originally planned to be photographed in 3-D, but those plans were scrapped sometime during production.\n\nThe film was shot in Morgan City, Louisiana with some scenes shot in New Orleans and on an oil-drilling barge in the Gulf of Mexico. While filming the scenes on-location in Louisiana, Dan Duryea slipped and fell from the roof of a tugboat (which appears throughout the film). He suffered a broken rib, contusion, and bruises but was able to continue filming after a day or two of rest.\n\nThe film premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on Tuesday, May 19, 1953 demonstrating Universal-International's widescreen process and stereophonic sound. It began its release the following day.\n\nThe film received favourable reviews although some complained that the sound from the film's stereophonic presentation, with its use of three speakers, was loud and distracting.\n\nIt opened with a gross of $42,000, the best opening for a Universal film at Loew's State.\n\nUniversal first released this film on VHS on March 1, 1992. Then, on June 12, 2007, it was released on DVD as part of the \"James Stewart Screen Legend Collection\", a 3-disc set featuring four other films (\"Next Time We Love\", \"You Gotta Stay Happy\", \"The Glenn Miller Story\", and \"Shenandoah\"). This film was re-released on August 30, 2013 as a stand-alone DVD as part of the \"Universal Vault Series\". (The DVD releases of the movie are not in presented in the film's original 1.33:1 aspect ratio.)\n\n"}

Hanna\n\nJohn Griffin Hanna (1889–1948) was a sailboat designer, famous for designing the Tahiti ketch. \n\nHanna was born in Galveston, Texas, on October 12, 1889. During his childhood he was afflicted with deafness following scarlet fever, and lost a foot in a traffic accident. Around 1917, he settled in Dunedin, Florida, and was greatly influenced by the Greek double-ended sponge boats found in nearby Tarpon Springs, Florida. Shortly after his move to Dunedin, Hanna purchased a double-ended ketch-rigged sponge boat that had been built in Apalachicola, Florida by a Greek-American shipwright named Demo George. This vessel, and others that Hanna studied, would inspire the design of Hanna's famous Tahiti ketch. Hanna died in 1948.\n\nHanna originally wrote of his Tahiti ketch as a 30-foot deep-sea auxiliary cruiser. The design is described and illustrated in detail in the 1935 new edition of \"How to build 20 boats\", pp. 118–133.\n\nHannah designed a seventy-foot research vessel, \"Iorano\", for amphibian tractor inventor Donald Roebling, which was constructed on Roebling's own property, and which took part in a Smithsonian-connected scientific expedition led by Paul Bartsch in 1937. His 1926 Story-built ketch \"Faith\" was later purchased by director John Ford and renamed \"Araner\". Ford, a naval reservist, used the boat both for personal recreation, and for naval intelligence. The boat was later taken into US Navy service directly as USS Araner (IX-57) during World War II.\n\nAt least two boats of Hanna's design have circumnavigated the world twice. Jean Gau in the Atom; and Tom Steele in the Adios. (Don Holm, The Circumnavigators page 355).\n\nHannah was a gifted small vessel designer, but perhaps his greatest strength -and weakness- was as a writer and critic of other's designs. He was let go by the \"Rudder\" after a drawn-out feud with L. Francis Herreshoff, who was also a columnist there, and debated acerbically with Thomas C. Gillmer over \"Tahiti's\" design antecedents, as well as with Philip Rhodes, and Howard Chapelle.\n"}

While it is not an official requirement, it avoids any financial loss that a club might face in having to postpone any matches due to bad weather. The first ground in England to have under-soil heating installed was Goodison Park in 1958. The pitch at Old Trafford has of under-soil heating and at Elland Road there is an under-soil heating system installed beneath the surface, consisting of 59 miles (95 km) of piping.\n\nIn Germany under-soil heating is mandatory for division 1 and 2 Bundesliga clubs. The first ground to have it installed was the Olympic Stadium of Munich in 1972.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, despite the league having a winter break, the Czech First League requires all participating teams to play on surfaces with under-soil heating.\n\nSeveral American football teams in the National Football League also have such a system installed. With American football, it is more a matter of player safety, since NFL games are never postponed on account of cold weather.\n\nThere have been numerous occasions where under-soil heating's effectiveness has been questioned. One notable incident happened on December 27, 2005 when three stadia in the FA Premier League, supposedly equipped with under-soil heating, failed to stop their pitches being covered in thick snow - this led to the matches being postponed. Subsequently, on January 1, 2006, the Premier League investigated as to why the pitches at Macron Stadium (Bolton Wanderers), Ewood Park (Blackburn Rovers) and St. James' Park (Newcastle United) were not able to repel the snow. In the U.S., a notable example of the failure of an under-soil heating system occurred in 1967, when a newly installed system at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin failed before the NFL Championship game. The game would go on to be remembered as the \"Ice Bowl\".\n"}

Created by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley, the character appears in the pages of \"Ultimate Spider-Man\". Kenny McFarlane is one of the few characters not based on a counterpart from Marvel's main continuity, being an original Ultimate Marvel invention to the comics. However, his personality is based on Flash Thompson of the main continuity during his high school years. A version of the character is later introduced in the main continuity. \n\nIn \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", despite his apparent lack of intelligence based on being a stereotypical high school bully, Kenny is actually an astute teenager and able to deduce Spider-Man's secret identity but keeps this knowledge to himself; he respects the hero's wishes of secrecy and covertly helps him maintaining it. Knowing that Peter Parker is Spider-Man inspires Kenny to be a better person and occasionally helping others in needs.\n\nObese yet strong, Kenny McFarlane is the best friend of Flash Thompson and Liz Allan. Kenny attends Midtown High School where he plays basketball for the school team. There, he can regularly be found cooperating with Flash bullying Peter Parker. However, without Flash in the vicinity, he shows a more likeable side and is often shown being friendly and open to Peter, even letting Peter stay at his house after Peter had a fight with Uncle Ben. When Peter is bitten by the genetically enhanced spider that gave the spider powers, Kenny crushes the spider under his sneakers, killing it. Later, noticing changes in Peter's physical strength and abilities and recalling the spider bite, he deduces that Peter is Spider-Man. Flash and Liz refuse to believe him and demand he prove it by kicking Peter from behind. Peter's spider sense warns that the kick is coming and willingly takes the abuse rather than reveal the abilities, which appears to dissuade Kenny. This confrontation is observed by the new-student Gwen Stacy sticking up for Peter by pulling a knife on Kong.\n\nKong's attitude toward's Peter softens after the latter joins the basketball team and demonstrates deep loyalty to his new teammate. Kong maintains a fascination with Spider-Man even to the point of hero worship. Overtime, Kenny becomes a better person, ceased bullying, and tries to improve academically. Upon hearing about the upcoming \"Spider-Man\" movie, Kong enters a casting call for extras. His only line was \"Look in the sky, it's Spider-Man!\". With the film's success, he achieved some fame in his school.\n\nWhen Kenny and Peter share detention, Peter tells Kenny that Flash only hangs out with the latter solely out of a sense of superiority and treats him badly. Whether or not Kenny takes Peter's words to heart, he later has a particularly violent confrontation with Flash after the latter begins ridiculing the new student Kitty Pryde for being a mutant; Kenny slams Flash into a locker and furiously forces his friend to apologize, claiming he is \"sick of [Flash's] racist crap\", ending their friendship in the process. Frightened, Flash leaves the scene and Peter and MJ introduce Kitty to Kenny, and the pair walk away in conversation. He is later seen at Kitty's house, and Kitty later tells Peter of dating Kenny.\n\nLater, when Liz's mutant abilities manifest at a party, Kenny tells Peter to go help her; he still knew that Peter was Spider-Man all along but had kept the knowledge to himself. When Kitty was singled out by federal troops for being a mutant after the events of \"Ultimatum\", Kenny was one of the few classmates to stick up for Kitty, physically assaulting an agent to buy her time to escape. Kitty phased herself and Kenny through the floor and into the sewers, and they resume their relationship. Later, Kitty tells Peter that Kenny's mother took him out of the state.\n\nKong later shows up at an event hosted by May Parker to honor Peter and has a private conversation with Kitty.\n\nFollowing the \"Secret Wars\" events that seemingly destroyed Kenny's universe, he is revealed to have joined the U.S. army after finishing high school in the restored world.\n\nKenneth \"Kenny Kong\" McFarlane made his debut in the mainstream Marvel Universe in \"Starbrand & Nightmask\" #1 (February 2016). He is a student at Empire State University and meets Kevin Connor and Adam Blackveil. He discovers that they are actually Starbrand and Nightmask, but he keeps this information to himself.\n\nWriter Brian Michael Bendis did not name Kenny McFarlane consistently during his run on \"Ultimate Spider-Man\". In the first scenes, he is called by his nickname King Kong or simply Kong or even his real name. His last name was hinted to be Harlan in the first issue and his mother called him Clifford in issue #15. While in Ultimate Marvel Team-Up around the same time, in a story also written by Brian Michael Bendis, a teacher calls him Kenny. As a result of this information, in the \"Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe\", he was referred to as \"Kong Harlan, aka Clifford Kenneth Harlan\". However, in issue \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" #82, his name was finally revealed to be \"Kenny McFarlane\". He now refers to himself as Kenny McFarlane, and in an interview with Bendis, it is confirmed that this is his real name.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2229397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229397", "title": "Sir Douglas Quintet", "text": "Sir Douglas Quintet\n\nThe Sir Douglas Quintet was an American rock band, formed in San Antonio in 1964. With their first hits, they were acclaimed in their home state. When their career was established (subsequent to working with Texas record producer Huey Meaux), the band relocated to the West Coast. Their move coincided with the burgeoning San Francisco psychedelic rock scene of the mid 1960s to early 1970s. Overall, the quintet were exponents of good-times music with strong roots in blues and Texas-regional traditions.\n\nDoug Sahm, a veteran of the professional music scene who first sang on radio at the age of five, formed the Quintet (first called simply 'Sir Douglas') in 1964 with longtime friend Augie Meyers and the other original members, Jack Barber, Frank Morin, and Johnny Perez. Sahm had started in country music and had played (at age eleven) on-stage with Hank Williams, Sr. during the latter's final performance. Sahm went on to play in blues clubs in his teenage years and had gained experience as a band leader.\n\nThe initial success of the new group, the Quintet, on the airwaves and sales charts was achieved when they made records in conjunction with Houston music producer Huey P. Meaux. Houston's recording industry had become the center of Texas R&B music.\n\nThe Quintet was born in a cross-cultural south Texas musical melting pot that included the sounds and traditions of Mexico, Bohemia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and African-America. Aware of major trends, producer Huey Meaux advised connecting the new group with the English pop-music trend. As a consequence, the Texas-local R&B, Tex-Mex, and other veins the musicians were familiar with initially went through a period of influence by the British pop bands of the early and mid 1960s. For a short while, the youthful members of the group emulated Beatles-like \"mop-top\" demeanor and antics on stage. However, they soon outgrew these trappings.\n\nThe Quintet is perhaps best known for the 1965 hit single \"She's About a Mover\" written by Doug Sahm. The song, which has a 12-bar blues structure, was once named the number one 'Texas' song by \"Texas Monthly\". With an infectious Vox Continental organ riff provided by Augie Meyers and soulful vocals from Sahm, the track has a Tex-Mex sound. The regional smash became a breakaway hit, and the recording was used in the soundtracks of the films \"Echo Park\" (1986), \"American Boyfriends\" (1989), \"The Doors\" (1991), \"Riding in Cars with Boys\" (2001), \"Sorority Boys\" (2002), and \"Beautiful Darling: (2010). The Quintet's recordings were used as well in the soundtracks of other films, such as \"Cisco Pike\" and \"An Officer and a Gentleman\".\n\nIn addition to \"She's About a Mover,\" the band is known for its songs \"The Rains Came\" (1966), \"Mendocino\" (1968), \"It Didn't Even Bring Me Down\" (1969), and \"Dynamite Woman\" (1969). \"Mendocino\" was released in December 1968 and reached No. 27 in the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 by early 1969, spending 15 weeks in the chart. It was more successful in Europe, selling over three million copies there. The track was featured in the generally highly regarded film \"High Fidelity\", starring John Cusack and Jack Black. Having made considerable musical impact, the Quintet at one point went on to share the same European bill as the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones.\n\nThe Quintet played varied styles with an instrumental line-up that was typical of blues bands: one guitarist, keyboardist, bassist, and drummer, and a member who could play either trumpet or saxophone. Despite the blues band line-up and a musical influence from the blues, the Quintet's live sets didn't overemphasize misery or tension in the lyrical content or musical feeling of the songs. In their sets and on record, the Quintet included such blues classics as \"I Don't Believe\" (originally by Bobby Blue Bland) along with the upbeat \"Hey Little Girl\" (originally by Texas blues man Frankie Lee Sims) and \"T-Bone Shuffle\" (originally by blues giant T-Bone Walker).\n\nThe Sir Douglas Quintet is considered a pioneering influence in the history of rock and roll for incorporating Tex-Mex and Cajun styles into rock music. However, early influences on the band's emerging Texas style were of course broader than this, and included ethnic and pop music from the 1950s and 1960s, such as doo-wop, electric blues, soul music, and British Invasion.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the band relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and absorbed features of the nascent San Francisco Sound, including the loud and lush electric bass tone and freer percussion and guitar stylings. Band members also explored musical elements specific to modern jazz. For studio recordings, they sometimes added an extra session musician or two, often to flesh out the brass dimension of a track's sound. Good examples of what they produced by absorbing the new jazz and psychedelic elements into their music can be found on the album \"Sir Douglas Quintet + 2\". The lyrics in a Quintet song like \"The Song of Everything\" are plainly in the realm of the mystical, whimsical lyrics regarded as one of the characteristics of psychedelic music.\n\nIn live performances, blues, often with swing or shuffle beats, was usually a substantial component of the set. Besides doing their own original material, the Quintet revived several classics such as Jimmie Rodgers' \"In the Jailhouse Now\" and Freddy Fender's \"Wasted Days and Wasted Nights\" to be found on the albums \"Son of San Antonio\" (originally on \"The Best of The Sir Douglas Quintet,\" 1966) and \"Texas Fever\" (originally on \"The Return of Doug Saldana,\" 1971), respectively.\n\nIn 2005 they were among the new class of musicians chosen for the nominating ballot to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition to Sahm and Meyers, original Sir Douglas Quintet members included Jack Barber on bass; Frank Morin on saxophone, trumpet, and keyboards; and Johnny Perez, Ernie Durawa, or T.J. Ritterbach on drums. In 1969 Harvey Kagan joined the Quintet on bass, forming their most familiar line up - Kagan, Morin, Perez, Sahm, and Meyers. Bassist Jim Stallings also contributed to several albums during this period of shifting personnel which included, among others, guitarist Tom Nay of Sarasota, Florida (who played with the group for about a year) and John York, who later replaced Chris Hillman in The Byrds, and contributions from San Antonio crooner/saxophonist Danny Segovia. Sahm and Meyers were later also members of the Texas Tornados (with Freddy Fender and Flaco Jiménez) in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1972, the group split up when Sahm contracted to produce a solo album. Meyers, Perez, Morin, and Stallings briefly regrouped as The Quintet, with Sonny Farlow taking Sahm's place. In 1973, several Sir Douglas Quintet outtakes were released in their final album from the group's classic era, \"Rough Edges.\"\n\nSahm and Meyers continued to work together throughout the late 1970s, and rejoined with Perez in 1980 for a reunion tour and album. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the band was joined by Louie Ortega, formerly of the 1960s band Louie & the Lovers and currently of the Texas Tornados.\n\nFounder Doug Sahm died of a heart attack in his sleep in a motel room in Taos, New Mexico, on November 18, 1999, at the age of 58. \n\nJohnny Perez owned Topanga Skyline Studios, with \"the Vibe and the Magic of the '70's.\" Skyline's grand woodwork, welcoming business culture, and \"western fort\" dirt courtyard set the stage for drummer Perez to mentor and inspire generations of young artists - until his death on September 11, 2012 at the age of 69, in a California hospital, from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. \n\nHarvey Kagan performed with a San Antonio area wedding/event band, The Oh So Good! Band, best known for discovering American Idol contestant Haley Scarnato. Kagan died on July 5, 2019, aged 73.\n\nAugie Meyers continues to tour, and record on his own independent record labels, based in Bulverde, Texas. Frank Morin remains active in music, with teaching, production, and film soundtracks work. Jimmy Stallins lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico where he plays bass, guitar, and keyboards at local Pro-Jam sessions. He is also in the process of writing his autobiography with heavy emphasis on his time with the Sir Douglas Quintet and the effect that experience had on his life.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bach also used a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a choir of trombones, two oboes, strings and continuo. He set the first movement in \"archaic\" motet style, but the arias in \"modern\" \"concertante\" style, only occasionally reminiscent of the chorale tune.\n\nThe cantata was first published in 1851, as No. 2 in the first volume published by the Bach Gesellschaft.\nBach took office as Thomaskantor, music director in Leipzig, end of May 1723. It was part of his duties to supply music for the Sundays and feast days of the liturgical year at four churches of the town, and he decided to compose new cantatas for these occasions. He began with a cantata for the first Sunday after Trinity in 1723, performed on 30 May, and wrote a series of church cantatas until Trinity of the next year, which became known as his first cantata cycle. The following year, he composed new cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year, each based on one Lutheran chorale, an effort which became known later as his chorale cantata cycle. He wrote as the second cantata of this cycle, which he began a week before with .\n\nBach wrote the cantata for the Second Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the First Epistle of John, \"He that loveth not his brother abideth in death\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the great banquet (). The cantata is based on the chorale in sixth stanzas \"\", a paraphrase of Psalm 12 by Martin Luther, published in 1524 in the \"Achtliederbuch\", the first Lutheran hymnal. In the format of Bach's chorale cantata cycle, the words of the hymn are retained unchanged in the outer movements, here the first and the sixth, while an unknown contemporary librettist transcribed the ideas of the inner stanzas in poetry for recitatives and arias, which matched the style of Bach's cantatas of the first cycle. Bach first performed the cantata on 18 June 1724.\n\nBach structured the cantata in six movements. The first and last are set for choir as a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale. They frame alternating recitatives and arias with the text arranged by the librettist. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The duration of the piece has been stated as 20 minutes.\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book by Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbols for common time (4/4) and \"alla breve\" (2/2). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.\n\nThe first and last movements set Luther's original words and the original melody, both dating to 1524 and thus already 200 years old when Bach wrote his cantata. Bach used a style that has been called \"archaic\": the instruments include a choir of trombones doubling the voices.\n\nIn the opening chorale fantasia, \"\" (Ah God, look down from heaven), the melody of the chorale is sung by the alto in long notes as a cantus firmus, doubled by two oboes. Dürr calls it an exemplary cantus firmus motet, with each entrance of the chorale tune prepared by fugal entrances of the other voices on the same theme. The instruments double the voices, with the occasional exception of the continuo. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 and recorded at the Basilique Saint-Denis in Paris, assumes that the severe text caused Bach to return to the austere motet style which was already old-fashioned.\n\nThe second movement is a \"secco\" recitative, \"\" (They teach vain, false deceit, which is opposed to God and His truth), which changes to arioso for two lines that resemble the words of the chorale. These lines are marked \"adagio\", and in them the continuo plays in canon with the voice.\n\nThe alto aria, \"\" (O God, remove the teachings that pervert your word!), is written in more modern \"concertante\" style with a solo violin as the obbligato instrument, playing lively figuration. The last line of the text remains close to the original, and again Bach quotes the chorale tune.\n\nThe bass recitative, \"\" (The wretched are confused), is accompanied by the strings. It changes to \"arioso\" during the middle section, which lets God respond to the pleas of the sinners: \"Ich muss ihr Helfer sein\" (I must be their helper). Even in the outer sections, the string writing enforces a certain rigidity of the rhythm.\n\nThe tenor aria, \"\" (Through fire, silver is purified, through the cross the Word is verified.), is accompanied by a concerto of the oboes and strings. The instruments are first silent in the middle section, but return for its transition to the da capo with the words \"\" (be patient in cross-bearing and distress). Gardiner notes that the instrumental music suggests \"liquid movement or the flow of molten metal\", and reminds of Bach's interest in coins and precious metals, and of contemporary alchemists in Dresden trying to turn base metal to gold for August the Strong, but making porcelain instead.\n\nThe closing chorale, \"\" (This, God, you would keep pure before this wicked race; ), is a four-part setting, with all instruments reinforcing the voices.\n\nThe autograph score is held by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (Preußischer Kulturbesitz).\n\nThe cantata was originally published in 1851 as in the first volume of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA), edited by Moritz Hauptmann. The New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score in 1981, edited by George S. Bozarth, with the critical commentary published in 1984.\n\nRecordings of Bach's cantatas began in the first half of the 20th century. Series of recordings, often for broadcasting, were made from 1950. Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt were the first to begin recording the complete cantatas in a 20-year collaboration using period instruments, boys' choirs and boy soloists. Helmuth Rilling completed a recording of the sacred cantatas and oratorios on Bach's 300th birthday, 21 March 1985. Other projects to record all sacred cantatas in historically informed performance were completed by Ton Koopman, John Eliot Gardiner, Pieter Jan Leusink and Masaaki Suzuki. Sigiswald Kuijken began to record a cycle of cantatas for the \"Complete Liturgical Year\" with an OVPP choir and historic instruments, the ensemble La Petite Bande.\n\nIn the following table, green background indicates an ensemble playing period instruments in historically informed performance.

This organoaluminium compound was investigated originally as a co-catalyst for the polymerization of alkenes.\n\nLike most organoaluminum compounds, the compound’s structure is most probably more than that suggested by its empirical formula. A variety of techniques, not including X-ray crystallography, suggest that the compound exists as a dimer and a trimer, consisting of tetrahedral aluminium centers sharing bridging hydride ligands. Hydrides are small and, for aluminium derivatives, are highly basic, thus they bridge in preference to the alkyl groups.\n\nDIBAL can be prepared by heating triisobutylaluminium (itself a dimer) to induce beta-hydride elimination:\n\nAlthough DIBAL can be purchased commercially as a colorless liquid, it is more commonly purchased and dispensed as a solution in an organic solvent such as toluene or hexane.\n\nDIBAL is useful in organic synthesis for a variety of reductions, including converting carboxylic acids, their derivatives, and nitriles to aldehydes. DIBAL efficiently reduces α-β unsaturated esters to the corresponding allylic alcohol. By contrast, LiAlH reduces esters and acyl chlorides to primary alcohols, and nitriles to primary amines [use Feiser work-up procedure]. DIBAL reacts slowly with electron-poor compounds, and more quickly with electron-rich compounds. Thus, it is an electrophilic reducing agent whereas LiAlH can be thought of as a nucleophilic reducing agent.\n\nAlthough DIBAL reliably reduces nitriles to aldehydes, the reduction of esters to the same functional group is an infamously finicky reaction which looks useful on paper but often leads to mixtures of alcohol and aldehyde in practice. This problem has been addressed by careful control of the reaction conditions using continuous flow chemistry.\n\nDIBAL, like most alkylaluminium compounds, reacts violently with air and water, potentially leading to fires.\n\n"}

ZEEP first went critical at 15:45 on September 5, 1945. ZEEP's was the first operational nuclear reactor outside the United States.\n\nThe reactor was designed by Canadian, British and French scientists as a part of an effort to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons during World War II. It was developed while the Montreal Laboratory and Chalk River Laboratories research facility were under the supervision of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). ZEEP was instrumental in the development of the NRX and NRU reactors, which led to the development of the successful CANDU reactor. ZEEP was used to test reactivity effects and other physics parameters needed for reactor development at Chalk River Laboratories, including fuel lattices for the NRU reactor situated next door.\n\nZEEP was one of the world's first heavy water reactors, and it was also designed to use natural (unenriched) uranium; a feature carried through to the CANDU design. Uranium enrichment is a complex and expensive process; thus, the ability to use unenriched uranium gave ZEEP and its descendants a number of distinct advantages.\n\nZEEP continued to be used for basic research until 1970. It was decommissioned in 1973 and dismantled in 1997. In 1966 ZEEP was designated a historic site by Ontario, and commemorated with an historic plaque. Both this plaque and ZEEP itself are now on display at the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa, Canada.\n\n\n"}

Another hallmark of Shrovetide is the opportunity for a last round of merrymaking associated with Carnival before the start of the somber Lenten season. On the final day of the season, Shrove Tuesday, many traditional Christians, such as Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, \"make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with.\" During Shrovetide, many churches place a basket in the narthex to collect the previous year's Holy Week palm branches that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies; on Shrove Tuesday, churches burn these palms to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday.\n\nIn the Roman Rite (pre-1970 form, and today in the Ordinariate (Anglo-Catholic) Form and Extraordinary (Tridentine) Form), and in similar Anglican and Lutheran uses, a pre-Lenten season lasts from Septuagesima Sunday until Shrove Tuesday and has thus also been known as Shrovetide. The Extraordinary form of the Roman Rite that includes this special period of 17 days refers to it as the season of Septuagesima; the Ordinariate Form uses the term Pre-Lent. The liturgy of the period is characterized by violet vestments (except on feasts), the omission of the Alleluia before the Gospel, and a more penitential mood. Fasting does not commence until the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday. The earliest the Pre-Lenten season can begin is January 18 and the latest it can end is March 9. It is absent in the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite and more recent Anglican forms of all these traditions, but may be found in some Lutheran churches who use the One-Year Lectionary to organize the church year.\n\nIn Northern Germany, local tradition states that if \"sausages and sauerkraut are eaten at Shrovetide, good luck will follow\". On the last day of Shrovetide, in Bohemia, a man personifies \"Shrovetide\" in a procession of masqueraders and whoever is able to snatch straw from his hat and place it under a hen in the coming Spring is said to have eggs that surely will hatch.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the pre-Lenten season lasts three weeks, beginning on the Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee and continuing through the Sunday of Forgiveness (the day before the beginning of Great Lent). Since the liturgical day begins at sunset, and Great Lent begins on a Monday, the point at which Great Lent begins is at Vespers on the night of the Sunday of Forgiveness, with a \"Ceremony of Mutual Forgiveness\" (in some monasteries, this ceremony is performed at Compline instead of Vespers). Thus begins the first day of the Great Fast, which is known as Clean Monday. The weeks of pre-Lent and Great Lent are anticipatory by nature; they begin on Monday and end on Sunday, each week being named for the theme of the upcoming Sunday. The hymns used during the Pre-Lenten and Lenten seasons are taken from a book called the Triodion.\n\nThe weeks of the Pre-Lenten Season break are:\n\n"}

No Highway) is a 1951 British black-and-white aviation film from 20th Century Fox, produced by Louis D. Lighton, directed by Henry Koster, that stars James Stewart, Marlene Dietrich, Glynis Johns, Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott, and Jack Hawkins. The screenplay was written by Oscar Millard, with additional material provided by Alec Coppel.\n\nThe film is based on the novel \"No Highway\" by Nevil Shute and was one of the first films that depicted a potential aviation disaster involving metal fatigue. Although the film follows the plot of Shute's original 1948 novel in general, \"No Highway in the Sky\" notably omits references to the supernatural contained in the original novel, including the use of automatic writing to resolve a key element in the original novel's story. The role of Scott, the recently appointed administrator who narrates the novel, is curtailed in the film version, which means that one of the several touching features of the book, Scott's blind faith in his scientist, is also missing.\nTheodore Honey (James Stewart), an eccentric \"boffin\" with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, is working on solving a difficult aviation crash problem. A widower with a 12-year-old daughter, Elspeth (Janette Scott), Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a fatigue test is performed on the fin and tailplane (empennage) by vibrating it using a dynamic shaker at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles.\n\nIt is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale (Marlene Dietrich), a fellow passenger. \n\nAfter the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly and seriously damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory, and to save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press.\n\nTeasdale and an airline stewardess Marjorie Corder (Glynis Johns) both take a liking to Mr Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates. Teasdale speaks to Honey's superiors on his behalf, claiming she believes in him. Corder, meanwhile, has stayed on with Honey and his daughter as a nurse. Having now observed Honey's many qualities beyond his minor eccentricities, and after becoming very close to Elspeth, she decides to make the arrangement permanent by marrying the engineer.\n\nDuring a hearing in which his sanity is questioned, Honey angrily protests, refusing to be railroaded. He resigns and walks out, threatening to collapse other Rutland Reindeers until all the aircraft are grounded. He then goes back to his laboratory to prove his metal fatigue theory is sound, but the time he predicted for the structural failure soon passes without anything happening. Meanwhile the Reindeer airliner he disabled at Gander is repaired, and soon after it completes a test flight, the tail falls off while taxiing. Shortly thereafter, the same thing happens to the tail frame in the laboratory, and Honey discovers that he failed to include temperature as a variable factor in his fatigue calculations.\n\n\nThe first writer who worked on the script was R. C. Sherriff. The story was then assigned to producer Buddy Lighton who hired Oscar Millard to do the screenplay. Millard said he spent six months writing the script without ever looking at a Sheriff draft. In London, the producer Buddy Lighton hired Alec Coppel to rewrite some scenes that were based at the Farnborough Aircraft Establishment.\n\nThe actor Robert Donat was originally cast in the lead role, but when this deal fell through, James Stewart was cast. This would be the second pairing of Stewart with Marlene Dietrich, the first being 1939's \"Destry Rides Again\".\n\n\"No Highway in the Sky\", the film's working title, became the release title for English-speaking countries apart from the UK, where it retained the novel title \"No Highway\". As noted in contemporary sources, filming took place in 1950 at Denham Studios, with location shooting at the Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire, England, although the scene with a Gloster E.1/44 prototype was possibly staged at Boscombe Down.\n\nA November 1950 \"Hollywood Reporter\" news item noted that Stewart underwent an emergency appendectomy in London while the film was in production.\n\nDirector Koster called it \"one of my finest pictures. I thought it was a marvelous story and I had a marvelous script by very fine writers\".\n\nThe film was popular at the British box office.\n\nReviews of \"No Highway in the Sky\" were decidedly mixed. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" had a favourable review, noting the film's \"... sly construction of an unusual plot and wry suspense\". In a later appraisal, reviewer Dennis Schwartz opined: \"American military war hero pilot James Stewart plays the eccentric Yank scientist working for a British airline [Stewart's character was not actually working for an airline but rather the government RAE Farnborough.], and it gives one of his better and more pleasing performances as someone kindhearted but a bit daffy. ... The one-dimensional characters add no emotional depth, especially when the awkward romance is tossed onto the airplane drama, but Stewart plays a likable character that translates into a rather genial pic with much appeal\".\n\nThree years after the film, and six years after the publication of Nevil Shute's original novel (\"No Highway\"), there were two fatal crashes of the world's first jet passenger airliner, the de Havilland Comet. Investigation found that metal fatigue was the cause of both accidents, albeit in the main fuselage and not the tail section.\n\nOn 21 April 1952, before a live studio audience, Stewart and Dietrich, along with a full cast, reprised their roles in an adaptation of \"No Highway in the Sky\" on the CBS \"Lux Radio Theatre\".\n\n\"No Highway\", a BBC radio adaptation dramatised by Mike Walker with Paul Ritter as Honey, William Beck as Scott, and Fenella Woolgar as Teasdale was directed by Toby Swift for BBC Radio 4's Classic Serial in August 2010.\n\nAn earlier BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial, dramatised by Brian Gear in three episodes, and broadcast weekly from 11 May 1986, starred John Clegg as Theodore Honey, Norman Bowler as Scott, and Margaret Robertson as Monica Teasdale.\n\nThe central element of \"No Highway in the Sky\" (a concerned airline passenger having unique knowledge of an imminent danger, taking drastic action to eliminate it and then being regarded as crazy) is comparable to that of \"The Twilight Zone\" episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", starring William Shatner. A similar additional scene in the 1983 \"\" anthology feature film is that of the character played by John Lithgow, who like that of James Stewart, is portrayed as an engineering expert.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2229448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229448", "title": "Rockridge, Oakland, California", "text": "Rockridge, Oakland, California\n\nRockridge is a residential neighborhood and commercial district in Oakland, California. Rockridge is generally defined as the area east of Telegraph Avenue, south of the Berkeley city limits, west of the Oakland hills and north of the intersection of Pleasant Valley Avenue/51st Street and Broadway. Rockridge was listed by Money Magazine in 2002 as one of the \"best places to live\".\n\nIt lies at an elevation of 187 feet (57 m). Some residential portions of the neighborhood consist mainly of relatively large homes built between the 1920s and the 1950s, although some homes date even earlier to 1909–1912. Other portions of the neighborhood consist of small bungalows and cottages. In other sections, multi-family apartment buildings add density which supports nearby transit and retail. It is also home to Claremont Country Club.\n\nRockridge is named for the outcroppings of rock at the northern end of the long shutter ridge formed by the Hayward Fault which encloses the linear valley in which the Montclair district of Oakland is situated. An example of this rock can be seen at an abandoned quarry adjacent to the Rockridge Shopping Center on Pleasant Valley Road. This quarry was operated well into the 1950s and is now used as a reservoir for the Claremont Country Club. Prior to the construction of the shopping center in the late 1960s, the Broadway side of the shopping center had a used car lot.\n\nMuch of the buildout of Rockridge in the 1920s was powered by the desire of middle-class white Protestants to avoid 'undesirable' racial groups, powered by racial covenants that prohibited ownership of property by certain ethnic groups. This is reflected in the current racial makeup of the area—it, unlike most of Oakland, is mostly white.\n\nThe main thoroughfare in the area other than College Avenue is now Pleasant Valley Avenue. Originally Pleasant Valley Avenue did not cross over the hill from Piedmont Avenue to Broadway – instead it terminated at Piedmont Avenue while continuing along a large portion of what is now known as Grand Avenue. The main link between Piedmont Avenue and Broadway was the – still existing – Mather Street that would turn into 42nd by Oakland Technical High School. A short, small, street called McAdam existed at what is now the current Pleasant Valley and 51st junction but ended at Gilbert Street. The expansion of McAdam into Pleasant Valley and continuation over the hill did not happen until the 1960s.\n\nLike many neighborhoods, Rockridge has had its ups and downs. Prior to the completion of Highway 24 in 1964, Miles Avenue and several other streets were laid out differently. Residents living in the area at the time, once known as \"Little Italy\" because of a large number of Italian immigrants, saw the decline of the neighborhood's human scale into the 1970s due to the separation of the neighborhood caused by the SR-24 freeway. In the mid to late 1970s, some storefronts on College Avenue were boarded up. However, due to the success of a number of new businesses, who together formed a \"critical mass\" of commercial attraction, the Rockridge commercial district began to thrive again.\n\nUntil the 1950s, electric trolley trains ran along College Avenue on what is now AC Transit bus routes 51A and 51B. Additionally, as late as 1959, the railroad tracks of the Sacramento Northern Railway ran along Shafter Avenue, crossed College Ave. near where the Rockridge BART station is now and ran along the corridor of what is now state Highway 13 (the portion after Ashby Ave.), through Montclair Village and over into Contra Costa County. Film footage of this route has been broadcast over local PBS TV station KQED in a 1990s documentary on the development of the East Bay.\n\nThe Oakland Firestorm of 1991 came within 1/2 mile of College Avenue, destroying a large part of the Upper Rockridge area east of Broadway. A memorial wall was created under the Rockridge BART station, located on College Avenue, following the fire.\n\nThe main thoroughfare in Rockridge is College Avenue. The district is bounded by 51st Street on the southern end and Berkeley's Elmwood district on the northern end. The College Avenue strip running through Rockridge is home to more than 80 restaurants, cafes and upscale retail stores, including several bookstores specializing in used and rare books. Rockridge Market Hall, a collection of gourmet food establishments, is located there.\n\nDreyer's Ice Cream maintains its international corporate headquarters in Rockridge on College Avenue, and operates its only retail ice cream parlor on the premises, where it offers visitors the opportunity to test new flavors and products.\n\nThe Rockridge Branch of the Oakland Public Library is one of the most visited establishments in the neighborhood and is home to an extensive collection of children's books and audio/visual materials.\n\nRockridge is often mentioned in tourist guidebooks on Oakland and the East Bay.\n\nBART serves the neighborhood with the Rockridge Station. The area around the station provides transportation by train, bus, and casual carpool to all Bay Area airports, downtowns, and entertainment districts, while surrounded by open air markets, cafes, bars, shopping, and homes. The Rockridge BART station is located in the center of Rockridge, where College Avenue passes under the Grove Shafter Freeway (Highway 24). AC Transit bus lines 49, 51A, and 51B serve the center of the neighborhood, while line E runs along Claremont Avenue and lines 6, 12, CB, and V run along its edges.\n\nBART travel times from Rockridge to Montgomery Station near San Francisco's downtown financial district averages 22 minutes. Travel times to Downtown Oakland averages 8 minutes.\n\nMany Rockridge residents are involved in their neighborhood's political, educational and cultural life. Rockridge has several community organizations including the Rockridge District Association and the Rockridge Community Planning Council. The \"Rockridge News\" is published monthly and hand delivered to every resident's home.\n\nRockridge is home to the community-built Rockridge-Temescal Greenbelt Park, a linear park anchored at each end by two unique community-built play structures. It is commonly known as Frog Park, for the acronym of the organization which helped build the park, called FROG, the Friends of the Rockridge Temescal Greenbelt. FROG was organized in 2001 and raised more than $100,000 from the community to create the greenbelt park. It includes two play structures built entirely by volunteers, linked by a landscaped path which follows Temescal Creek, winding from Hudson Street to Redondo and Clarke. There are also basketball courts, a dog park, butterfly garden, public art by Mark Brest van Kempen, a Lily Pad Plaza, and a series of picnic tables and benches. The community group FROG is a project of the Rockridge Community Planning Council; a FROG steering committee organizes maintenance and community clean-up activities.\n\nThe Rockridge neighborhood is served by the Oakland Unified School District.\n\nChabot Elementary School in Rockridge, founded in 1927, serves grades kindergarten through 5th grade. Chabot consistently scores high in statewide assessments, and the Chabot PTA offers extensive after-school programs including language immersion classes and arts and music classes.\n\nClaremont Middle School (formerly Claremont Junior High School) has occupied its campus on College Avenue in the heart of Rockridge since 1913. The original building was demolished and rebuilt during the 1970s as part of a statewide program of retrofitting schools for earthquake safety. Claremont now serves more than 400 students in grades 6–8.\n\nRockridge students in grades 9 through 12 attend Oakland Technical High School.\n\nAn “alternative” public school, Far West High School, is a visual arts-focused campus for grades 7–12. It occupied the site of the former Rockridge Elementary School on Broadway Terrace, across the street from the California College of the Arts. The Oakland School Board made the decision in 1979 to close and demolish Rockridge Elementary School because of declining enrollment (less than 150 students) and fears for the earthquake safety of the original school building, a two-story structure built in 1923. The original auditorium was torn down in the 1950s, and the current one (still in use and doubling as the cafeteria) was constructed in 1959. It is now the upper campus to Oakland Technical High School.\n\nMentoring Academy is a private independent high school that offers individualized, self-paced, mentored instruction. Mentoring Academy, located at 5951 College Avenue, was founded by John Muster in 2012.\n\nPost-secondary education is offered by the California College of the Arts, formerly the California College of Arts and Crafts. The school was founded in 1907 and has been located at its present site, at the intersection of College and Broadway, since 1922.\n\nProfessional education for Roman Catholic priests and friars is offered at St. Albert's College, a Dominican institution located on Birch Court near Claremont Middle School.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2229454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229454", "title": "Mark Twain Tonight!", "text": "Mark Twain Tonight!\n\nMark Twain Tonight! is a one-man play devised by Hal Holbrook, in which he depicts Mark Twain giving a dramatic recitation selected from several of Twain's writings, with an emphasis on the comic ones.\n\nThe recitation's genesis was a show that Holbrook performed with his then-wife Ruby in which she would interview him portraying famous people in history, including Twain. Holbrook revised the concept into a one-man show in the 1950s, first performing it at the Lock Haven State Teachers College in Pennsylvania in 1954. He made his first New York City appearance as Twain in the Off-Broadway engagement in 1959 and premiered it on Broadway in 1966. Holbrook's performance was first noticed by New York producer John Lotas at The Lambs Club in Manhattan. Lotas presented the show at the Forty-First Street Theatre, where it ran for 174 performances. He won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for that appearance and an Emmy Award nomination for the 1967 television broadcast (which was produced by David Susskind) on CBS.\n\nThe last performance on Broadway was in 2006. Holbrook was known to alternate the material that he performed. The original program from the 1959 Off-Broadway engagement included the note, \"While Mr. Twain’s selections will come from the list below, we have been unable to pin him down as to which of them he will do. He claims this would cripple his inspiration. However, he has generously conceded to a printed program for those who are in distress and wish to fan themselves.\" This appeared on programs for the show until Holbrook abruptly announced his retirement from the show in September 2017. \n\nAt the time of his retirement, Holbrook noted that he had been performing under the name \"Mark Twain\" 13 years longer than its originator: Samuel Clemens had adopted the pseudonym at age 24 and died at the age of 74.\n\nIn an interview with William Goldman, Holbrook explained how he structured the show. \"Who wants to see an evening about a literary figure? I knew that in the first act I had to overcome that natural reluctance, so my biggest desire was to make them laugh their asses off at the start, so they'd go out at intermission and say, 'Hey, this guy's funny.' The second act became the social-comment act. I'd start with some funny material to get them again (but not too much of it, or they'd never stop laughing and take the show right away from you). In the last act I gave them the Twain they'd been expecting all along: warm, whimsical, memories of childhood.\"\n\nHolbrook adapted to concerns that presenting Mark Twain as on an 1890s lecture circuit would use racial slurs acceptable in that era, but unacceptable to modern audiences. Challenging the critics, Holbrook often chose to read a passage from \"Huckleberry Finn\" where the orphaned, pipe-smoking, uneducated youngster, Huck, faces a poignant moral dilemma. Holbrook altered the narration to use the dialectally milder \"Nigra\" as the young boy wrestles with his conscience over following the law or his heart concerning \"the widow's Nigra, Jim,\" a runaway slave. Audiences have embraced this presentation as the boy ultimately rejects the legal, societal and even religious ramifications in favor of helping the runaway on his quest for freedom. It is one of the more somber segments of a usually humorous presentation, which Holbrook has felt important to continue in the spirit of Twain's own message.\n\nOn the occasion of Clemens's 175th birthday (November 30, 2010), Holbrook performed \"Mark Twain Tonight!\" in Elmira, New York, at the Clemens Center in front of a sell-out crowd. April 21, 2010 was the 100th anniversary of his death. The evening began with the singing of happy birthday to Clemens followed by Holbrook's appearance on stage. 2014 marked the 60th consecutive year that Holbrook had performed \"Mark Twain Tonight!\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2229472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229472", "title": "Mitsubishi 380", "text": "Mitsubishi 380\n\nThe Mitsubishi 380 is a mid-size car that was produced between 2005 and 2008 by Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Available only as a sedan, it marked the end of Australian production by the Japanese manufacturer.\n\nThe 380, given the model designation \"DB\", was the successor to the Mitsubishi Magna/Verada line of vehicles first introduced in 1985 (and 1991 for the Verada) but was only available as a sedan. The company spent over A$600 million developing and producing the car, which is heavily based on the ninth generation Mitsubishi Galant designed in the United States. The 380 continued the Mitsubishi Australia tradition of producing front-wheel drive sedans for the Australian market, and along with the Toyota Aurion, competed against the rear-wheel drive Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore vehicles.\n\nEven before the car's launch in October 2005, the 380 was stigmatised as the \"make or break\" model for Mitsubishi Australia. After a slow sales start, the line-up was updated with the Series II in April 2006, with the entry level model receiving price discount of nearly 20 percent. To generate further interest in the car, a Series III revision came on 29 July 2007 with mainly cosmetic changes. These updates failed to lift sales, and with production still unprofitable, Mitsubishi ceased manufacturing of the 380 in March 2008 just short of two years in production. A total of 32,044 were produced over the three year production, of which 30,195 were sold in Australia.\n\nThe development of the 380 began in 2002, when company executives in Japan gave approval to Mitsubishi Australia to commence work on two closely related vehicles. The first of which was a right-hand drive variant of the ninth generation Mitsubishi Galant, designated the codename \"PS41\". This was to be the replacement for the Magna and Verada. The second, which was planned to be launched in 2007 was a long-wheelbase version known internally as \"PS41L\" to be produced in both left- and right-hand drive configurations. However, as Mitsubishi's financial woes worsened, and DaimlerChrysler pulled-out of the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi alliance, \"PS41L\" was abandoned in 2004 and the likelihood of \"PS41\" making it into production looked even more doubtful. Company research conducted in mid-2004 revealed that 84 percent of Australians believed that Mitsubishi would cease production in Australia. To reinstate consumer confidence in the brand, before the launch of the 380, a series of television commercials began airing in December 2004. Centralised around Mitsubishi Australia's then CEO Tom Phillips, the advertisements promoted the introduction of an industry-first five-year/ warranty. Mitsubishi reworked a slogan from former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, concluding their commercials with the tagline, \"if you can find a better-built, better-backed car anywhere, then buy it\".\n\nIn total, A$600 million was spent on developing the 380, including $250 million on upgrading the Adelaide production facility to manufacture the vehicle. This included the installation of a new body press, casting the body sides from an individual piece of steel. This has the effect of producing a size differentiation from body-to-body, compared to the industry standard of in 2005.\n\nThe name 380 was chosen as a fresh start to Mitsubishi's sale of its sole Australian-made vehicle, given that the Magna name was now synonymous of slow-selling vehicle that was long overdue for a replacement. Indeed, among the seven names short-listed from a total of 220, Magna was not one of them. According to then CEO, Tom Phillips, the chosen name polled the best and, at the official launch, he stated \"'380' conjured up images of high technology, European standards, sophistication and performance with consumers. All of those attributes correlate directly with the positioning of our new car, and when added to the build quality that we are renowned for and a large 3.8-litre engine, '380' was a natural choice for the name of the car\".\n\nFrom the very beginning of the project, Mitsubishi had always intended that the \"PS41\" would be set apart from the North American Galant in terms of exterior styling. The problem was that \"PS41\" had to share the same basic foundation and the side profile was to remain for the most part unchanged. A revamp of the Clovelly Park facility allowed for the use of more robust bodies. The consequence of this is the tooling required to produce the panels. This gave Mitsubishi the opportunity to make several low key variances to the design. These came in the form of larger front guards, a revised bonnet, new headlamps as well as grilles and bumpers.\n\nThe front-end of the \"PS41\" was originally penned by Mitsubishi's design chief, Olivier Boulay. Boulay was also responsible for the 2003 Magna/Verada facelift, but this update fared poorly with buyers. When DaimlerChrysler pulled out of their alliance with Mitsubishi in 2004, it put an end to Boulay-designed Mitsubishis. This allowed for one final chance to progress the exterior design. However, with little more than a year until production, the redesign was shared between Mitsubishi Australia and its parent in Japan. The basic design that was reserved for the base and mid-luxury models was devised by the Japanese studio, whereas the sports oriented design that was conceived locally was reserved for the sports and upper-luxury models within the 380 range.\n\nCompared to the Galant, there were changes to 70 percent of the car to create a car more suited to the Australian market. Roads, legislation and consumer preferences were all driving forces behind the changes. The rear of the floorpan had to be overhauled to accommodate a full-sized spare wheel, and superior rear side members were required to improve towing capabilities. Body rigidity was also improved to deal with Australian road conditions. The improved body stiffness resulted in better vehicle dynamics, which were also supported through the use of sophisticated suspension designs, new shock absorbers and stabiliser bars.\n\nThe 380 was a sedan only and its sole powerplant was an all-new 3.8-litre V6 engine codenamed \"6G75\", which was also compatible for LPG fuel. Notably, unlike the practice adopted with its predecessor, the 380 sports models (VRX and GT) did not feature a higher output engine relative to other models in the range. The five-speed manual 380 ES (a five-speed sequential automatic was optional on the ES) was actually the fastest vehicle in the range. The new and engine was capable of propelling the car from in 7.6 seconds. Because of the choice of gear ratios, the manual and automatic transmission equipped 380s had the same acceleration figures.\n\nBetween September 2005 and January 2008, the 380 was produced and marketed in three series, as listed below.\n\nThe 380 went on sale on 13 October 2005. The range consisted of a 380 base model, the LS, LX, VRX and GT models. Standard equipment included: twin front and side airbags, climate control air-conditioning, cruise control, power windows, trip computer, steering wheel audio controls, and Bosch 8.0 anti-lock braking system. There was also a Limited Edition sold from September 2005 and into 2006.\n\nOn 28 April 2006, Mitsubishi announced price reductions with the introduction of the Series II upgrade. The entry model, now called the ES, was reduced from A$34,490 to $27,990. An SX model was introduced, priced at $32,990, while the LS model was dropped. Prices on VRX, LX, and GT models were also reduced by amounts ranging from $1,500 to $3,000. Mitsubishi announced that up to 1,500 retail customers who paid the old price would be eligible for a factory rebate of up to $2,000. There were essentially no mechanical or visual changes.\n\nThe 380 received the 2005 \"Australia's Best Cars Large Car\" award, as well as Insurance Australia Group's rating as the most secure Australian family car, Safest Australian Car Built 2006 for its four-star ANCAP result, Best Fleet Car by Delivery Australia magazine, and Lowest Running Costs in the Australian Motoring Clubs Report. The 3.8-litre engine won an award for engineering excellence from the Society of Automotive Engineers.\n\nMid-July 2007 saw the release of the 380 Series III, with range and price alterations designed to attract further sales and increase private buyer interest. The price of the ES model rose by $1000 but was compensated for by the addition of alloy wheels, fog lights and traction control. A total of four models comprised this range: ES, SX, VRX, and GT.\n\nUnlike the Series II, the new series saw all models received subtle visual and trim changes.\n\nAvailable with either a five-speed manual or automatic transmission, standard features on the ES included traction control, front and side air bags, automatic climate control air conditioning, power mirrors, power windows, power driver's seat, steering wheel-mounted remote audio controls, and anti-lock brakes with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD). Also featured in the ES were alloy wheels and sports front bumper treatment with front fog lamps. Next in the range, the auto-only SX adds sports seats with a unique grey trim, leather steering wheel, six-disc CD stereo with multifunction colour LCD display, sports rear bumper, 17-inch alloy wheels and sports-tuned suspension. The VRX featured a more comprehensive sports styling package, adding charcoal accents on the front and rear bumpers, high-profile rear wing, polished and painted 17-inch alloy wheels. Inside the VRX, blue seat fabric was added, as well as \"VRX\" embroidery on the front seats. Embroidered, silver-stitched leather was available as an option. The VRX was available with a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. The range-topping and automatic-only GT model featured standard leather trim, painted and polished 17-inch alloy wheels, integrated boot spoiler and chrome boot garnish, and side rubbing strips. Mitsubishi offer a no-cost luxury option for the GT, aptly titled the GTL. The GTL sported a more conservative rear light treatment, silver-painted alloy wheels, sunroof and a beige-on-black interior treatment.\n\nAt the Series III launch, Mitsubishi released two special edition variants. The Sports Edition, based on the ES, added 17-inch alloy wheels, high-profile rear wing, sports-tuned suspension, black interior trim and sunroof, for no extra cost.\n\nThe 380 VRX \"Fusion Burst\" was based on the VRX and comes in a limited-edition orange hue. Apart from the colour, the Fusion Burst came with sunroof and matching seat fabric for no extra cost.\n\nTeam Mitsubishi Ralliart (TMR) is an independent motorsport outfit that has also been affiliated with Mitsubishi Motors Australia to market higher performance model variants of the standard Mitsubishi range (in the same mould as FPV, HSV and TRD for Ford, Holden and Toyota Australia, respectively). In 2008, TMR produced the TMR380, a performance-enhanced version of the Series III 380 VRX model on which it was based. It was powered by a supercharged version of the standard 3.8-litre V6 engine, now producing and . The car was claimed to take six seconds over the sprint and was sold exclusively painted in \"TMR Red\" with a full body kit, 19-inch chrome alloy wheels and twin chrome exhaust tips. Its retail price was A$56,990, lower than its direct rival, the TRD Aurion). In total, 15 units had already been assembled at TMR's Dandenong facilities with another five on the way from Adelaide for conversion, when Mitsubishi Motors Australia announced the end of local production. All 20 models are individually numbered.\nAs a consequence of the first \"DB\" series selling in fewer numbers than expected, on 20 January 2006, Mitsubishi Australia announced that voluntary redundancies would be offered to 250 production employees to bring production in line with customer demand. In March 2006 the manufacturing plant closed for three weeks. Apart from launching limited editions (essentially base models with greater equipment levels), Mitsubishi took the drastic steps of applying significant price reductions for both the Series II and Series III.\n\nWhile the 380 was exported to other countries in small numbers, in the interest of salvaging local production, Mitsubishi Australia had also entered into negotiations with Proton of Malaysia over the possibility for a large export program. Under this program, a rebadged 380 would have replaced the Proton Perdana executive model, however, this deal never succeeded.\n\nOn 5 February 2008 Mitsubishi Motors Australia announced that the Clovelly Park plant would be shut down on 31 March, and Mitsubishi would pursue a \"full import strategy\" for the Australian market due to unviable 380 sales. The last 380 sedan (a silver Platinum Limited Edition, body number 32044) left the production line on 27 March 2008. The car was auctioned in late April 2008, with the $100,000 final price being donated to charities chosen in consultation with the winning bidder, a car dealership based in Western Australia. The similar second to last vehicle is exhibited at the Birdwood Motor Museum.\n\nIn October 2009, the president of Mitsubishi Motors, Osama Masuko revealed in hindsight that it \"was good that we closed the plant in March 2008 because this was the time the economy was still good and employees could find reemployment.\"\n\nThe 380 was also sold in New Zealand.\n\n"}

An unknown librettist reworked the ideas of the 18 stanzas in six movements, retaining the words of stanzas 1, 2 and 18 as movements 1, 2 and 6. Similarly, Bach retained the choral melody in three movements, set as a chorale fantasia in the opening chorus with the bass singing the cantus firmus, as a four-part setting with interspersed recitatives in the second movement, and in the closing chorale. He scored the cantata for two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo, with an added trobone to support the bass in the first movement, and a horn to support the soprano in the last movement.\n\nBach composed the cantata in his second year as \"Thomaskantor\" in Leipzig as part of his second annual cycle, planned to consist only of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He wrote the cantata for the Second Sunday after Epiphany. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans (we have several gifts – ) and from the Gospel of John (the Marriage at Cana – ).\n\nThe cantata is a chorale cantata based on the hymn \"\" in 18 stanzas attributed to Martin Moller (1587). It is a paraphrase of the Latin \"\", a medieval hymn attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux, a meditation on Jesus as a comforter and helper in distress. The unknown librettist retained the words of stanzas 1, 2 and 18 as movements 1, 2 and 6. In movement 2, stanza 2 is expanded by paraphrases of stanzas 3–5, while movement 3 is a paraphrase of stanza 6; movement 4 incorporates ideas from stanzas 7–14, and movement 5 relies on stanzas 15 and 16.In movement 2, stanza 2 is expanded by paraphrases of stanzas 3–5. Movement 3 is a paraphrase of stanza 6. Movement 4 incorporates ideas from stanzas 7–14. Movement 5 relies on stanzas 15 and 16. The poet did not relate his text to the reading from John 1:2.\n\nBach led the first performance of the cantata on 14 January 1725.\n\nBach structured the cantata in six movements. An opening chorus and a closing chorale frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. The first recitative is unusual: the chorus sings one line of the hymn's four lines, continued each time by a soloist in words of the poet. The last aria is a duet. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of horn (Co) to double the cantus firmus in the closing chorale, trombone (Tb) to reinforce the bass in the opening chorus, two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. The autograph score bears the title: \"Dominica 2 post Epiphanias / Ach Gott! Wie manches Hertzeleyd. / à / 4 Voci. / 2 Hautb: d'Amour / 2 Violini / Viola. / e Continuo / di J. S. Bach\", which means \"Sunday 2 after Epiphany ... for four voices, 2 oboes d'amore, 2 violins, viola and continuo by J. S. Bach\".\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.\n\nBach uses a melody of \"\" which appeared first in the Lochamer-Liederbuch. The melody appears in the opening chorus, sung by the bass as a cantus firmus, in the second movement, as a four-part setting with interspersed recitatives, and in the closing chorale.\n\nIn the opening chorus, \"\" (Ah, God, how much heartache), the cantus firmus is in the bass, which is doubled by the trombone, as in . Its mood of lamentation is supported by \"elegiac sounds\" of the oboes d'amore, sighing motifs in the strings, and the upper voices reflecting the oboe motifs. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that Bach used a repeated motif of six notes in chromatic descent, which is often used in chaconnes of the Baroque opera to express grief. The motif is used for the instrumental opening, each entry of a voice, interludes and conclusion.\n\nThe recitative, \"\" (How difficult it is for flesh and blood), combines the hymn tune sung by the four-part choir, with interpolated text sung by the soloists in turn. The lines of the hymn are separated by a joyful ostinato motif derived from the chorale tune. The musicologist Julian Mincham writes that the \"hybrid recitative provides an excellent example of Bach's experiments of investing long texts with sustained musical interest\".\n\nThe bass aria, \"\" (Although I experience the fear and torment of Hell), is accompanied by the continuo. It expresses the contrast of (hell's anguish) and (heaven of joy), with inestimable sorrows () disappearing into light mist ().\n\nA tenor recitative, \"\" (My body and spirit might despair), expresses trust in Jesus to overcome despair.\n\nIn the duet for soprano and alto, \"\" (When cares press upon me), in \"bright E major\", as the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff writes, the voices are embedded in a \"dense quartet texture\". He concludes that the movement \"banishes human care by means of joyful singing\". The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the obbligato motif, which is later picked up by the voices, is played by the oboes d'amore and violin in unison, providing \"a new and remarkable tone colour\". Bach refers to the Cross, as mentioned in the text, by using a cross-motif in the melody and applying double sharp marked by a cross. The voices intensify words such as \"dringen\" (press) and \"singen\" (sing) by extended coloraturas.\n\nThe closing chorale, \"\" (If my heart remains pure in faith), is a four-part setting. The choral melody, now in the soprano, is reinforced by a horn.\n\nThe selection is taken from the listing on the Bach-Cantatas website.\n\n"}

The project also included the construction of a public square.\n\nThe bridge's name was chosen in May 2005, after a BBC Five Live poll. It is named after a grey (though appearing white in old black and white photographs and films) Metropolitan Police horse, named 'Billy', that was used to restore order after the huge numbers of spectators (estimated at between 200,000-300,000) who turned up to witness the 1923 FA Cup Final spilled onto the pitch before kick off.\n\nThat game, the first to be held at the old Wembley Stadium, was won by Bolton Wanderers, beating West Ham United 2–0.\n\nUnlike the old footbridge, the new structure was designed to cope with up to 12,000 people an hour, the estimated number of users during match days. The bridge and square opened in 2008. They now give easy access from the Chiltern Line to London Designer Outlet.\n\nIn May 2005, the naming decision took place in the form of an online poll hosted by BBC Five Live, in conjunction with the London Development Agency (who were building the bridge and who had conceived the idea of a public poll), and won from a shortlist of Live Aid bridge (in memory of the 1985 concert held at the stadium), Sir Alf Ramsey (being England's World Cup winning manager), Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst (two of Sir Alf's team).\n\nThe LDA received over 670,000 nominations from all over the world. The name with the most nominations, however, mainly coming from Germany, was Dietmar Hamann, who scored the last goal at the old Wembley Stadium. This was a qualification game in October 2000 for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, with a German 1–0 win against England (2000 England v Germany football match). The LDA decided to name the bridge White Horse Bridge instead.\n\n"}

This form of marriage is haram (forbidden) according to the hadith of Islamic prophet Muhammad. Nikah Halala is practiced by a small minority of Muslims, mainly in countries that recognise the triple talaq.\n\nIn classical Islamic law, a husband may divorce by simply announcing to his wife that he repudiates her (talaq). The initial declaration of talaq is a revocable repudiation (ṭalāq rajʿah) which does not terminate the marriage. The husband can revoke the divorce at any time during the waiting period (\"‘iddah\") which lasts three full menstrual cycles. Resumption of sexual relations automatically retracts the repudiation. The divorce becomes final when the waiting period expires. This is called a \"minor\" divorce (\"al-baynuna al-sughra\") and the couple can remarry. If the husband repudiates his wife for the third time, it triggers a \"major\" divorce (\"al-baynuna al-kubra\"), after which the couple cannot remarry without an intervening consummated marriage by the wife to another man. This is known as \"tahlil\" or \"nikah halala\". Making the third pronouncement irrevocable acts as a deterrent to rash repudiations.\n\nIt is not permissible to marry a woman if one's objective is to make her permissible for her first husband per classical Islamic law. There are hadith from that confirm that entering a tahleel marriage with the intention of divorcing so that the original spouses can be remarry is forbidden (haraam). Abu Dawood and Ibn Majah reported that both the first husband (muhallil) and the temporary husband (muhallil lahu) were cursed by God, and Ibn Majah calls the temporary husband \"a borrowed billy-goat\". Al-Hakim Nishapuri adds that marriage should be based on genuine intentions, and that in the time of Muhammad, tahleel spouses would have been consideded adulterers. \n\nA BBC report found that halala is practised in certain Pakistani Muslim communities in the UK. The report uncovered many instances where women were socially and sexually exploited by local religious figures.\n\nPetitions have been filed by many Muslim women in Indian Supreme Court against nikah halala. In March 2018, the Supreme Court issued notice to the Indian government on the issue of nikah halala and polygamy. The BJP-ruled government is in favor of criminalizing nikah halala as the government believes that the practice is against the principles of gender justice, and made its stand clear in the apex court on the issue. Muslim women's rights organizations have welcomed the attitude of the Government and stated that these initiatives should have been taken much earlier.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India will hear the petition against nikah halala and polygamy in Muslim communities from July 20, 2018.\nOn Sept 13, 2018, a Muslim woman named Shabnam Rani was attacked with acid. She was one of the petitioners against the practice of nikah halala. Islamic radicals are the main suspects. On Sept 18, 2018 the Supreme Court asked the government to provide adequate security to the lady.\n\n"}

He was a professional organist aged 22, employed from 1703 in Arnstadt as the organist of the New Church (which replaced the burned Bonifatiuskirche, today known as the Bach Church). At age 18, he had inspected the new organ built by Johann Friedrich Wender, was invited to play one Sunday, and was hired. The organ was built on the third tier of a theatre-like church. Bach's duties as a church musician involved some responsibility for choral music, but the exact year he began composing cantatas is unknown. is one of a small group of cantatas that survive from his early years. According to the musicologist Martin Geck, many details of the score reflect \"organistic practice\".\n\nIn Arnstadt, the \"Kantor\" (church musician) Heindorff was responsible for church music in the Upper Church (Liebfrauenkirche), and the New Church where Bach was the organist. He typically conducted music in the Upper Church and would appoint a choir prefect for vocal music in the New Church. Wolff notes that \"subjecting his works to the questionable leadership of a prefect\" was not what Bach would have done. Therefore, most cantatas of the period are not for Sunday occasions, but restricted to special occasions such as weddings and funerals. is the only exception, but was most likely composed not for Arnstadt but for an application to a more important post at the Divi Blasii church in Mühlhausen.\n\nBach's early cantatas are (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, , and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.\n\nThe texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court.\n\nBach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata , also known as . He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in and a bassoon in . The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes:\nThe Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones notes in \"The Creative Development of Johann Sebastian Bach\":\nThe prescribed readings for the feast day were from the First letter to the Corinthians (\"Christ is our Easter lamb\" – ) and from the Gospel of Mark (the Resurrection of Jesus – ).\n\nThe reformer Martin Luther wrote several hymns in German to be used in church services. His hymn \"\" was based on the Latin hymn \"\", and first published in 1524. It became a main Easter hymn in German Lutheranism. The hymn stresses the struggle between Life and Death. The third stanza refers to the \"sting of death\", as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15. The fifth stanza relates to the \"\", the Paschal Lamb. The sacrificial \"blood\" (\"Its blood marks our doors\") refers to the marking of the doors before the exodus from Egypt. The final stanza recalls the tradition of baking and eating Easter Bread, with the \"old leaven\" alluding again to the exodus, in contrast to the \"Word of Grace\", concluding \"Christ would ... alone nourish the soul.\" In contrast to most chorale cantatas that Bach composed later in Leipzig, the text of the chorale is retained unchanged, which he did again only in late chorale cantatas.\n\n survives in a version from the 1720s when Bach held the position of \"Thomaskantor\" (director of church music) in Leipzig. There is documentary evidence suggesting that this Easter Sunday cantata was premiered in 1707. It is known that Bach performed a cantata of his own composition at Easter in 1707 as a part of his application for the post of organist of Divi Blasii church in Mühlhausen, and this may have been . By this time, Bach was already demonstrating ingenuity in keyboard music, as known from the early works in the Neumeister Collection. is a significant milestone in his vocal music. It was completed seven years before his sequence of Weimar cantatas, begun in 1714 with , and 17 years before he started a complete annual cycle of chorale cantatas in Leipzig in the middle of 1724 with .\n\nBach would have been attracted to Mühlhausen for its status as a free imperial city and the tradition of vocal music in its churches. Wolff notes that Bach possibly sent two other cantata scores with his application, and once he knew the date of the audition may have composed in addition. A month after Easter, on 24 May 1707, an agreement was reached to hire Bach, who seems to have been the only candidate considered seriously.\n\nBach performed the cantata again while \"Thomaskantor\" in Leipzig, notably at his first Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. This early work fits the cycle in the sense that it is based on a chorale, but its style is different from the others.\n\nBach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.\n\nThe title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing \"colla parte\" with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.\n\nThe scoring of the cantata has been described as \"archaic\" and its style \"medieval\":\n\nIn the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4) and \"alla breve\" (2/2). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown.\n\nLuther's hymn is based on the 12th-century Easter hymn \"\" (Christ is risen), which relies both in text and melody on the sequence for Easter, . A new version was published by Luther in 1524 and adapted by Johann Walter in his Wittenberg hymnal for choir, (1524). A slightly modified version appeared in 1533 in a hymnal by Kluge. This chorale tune would have been familiar to Bach's congregations. Bach composed other arrangements during his career, including the two chorale preludes BWV 625 and BWV 718, and the \"Fantasia super \"Christ lag in Todes Banden\"\", BWV 695. Bach's organ works and the version in the cantata (see below) use the passing notes and regular rhythmic patterns of the 1533 version.\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\new Staff «\n»\n</score>\n\nUnlike in Bach's later cantatas, all movements are in the same key. The cantata begins with an instrumental sinfonia. The seven stanzas are treated in seven movements as chorale variations (for all stanzas), with the melody always present as a . All stanzas end on the word \"Halleluja\".\n\nThe symmetrical sequence of the seven stanzas is a feature more often found in Bach's mature compositions: chorus – duet – solo – chorus – solo – duet – chorus. The musicologist Carol Traupman-Carr notes the variety of treatment of the seven stanzas, while retaining the same key and melody:\nJohn Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, calls Bach's setting of Luther's hymn \"a bold, innovative piece of musical drama\", observing that Bach was \"drawing on medieval musical roots (the hymn tune derives from the eleventh-century plainsong )\", and noting Bach's \"total identification with the spirit and letter of Luther's fiery, dramatic hymn\". Bach could follow \"Luther's ideal in which music brings the text to life\".\n\nThe cantata begins with an instrumental sinfonia a work in the style of an overture to a contemporary Venetian opera, with chordal passages and occasional polyphony. It introduces the first line of the melody, The mood is sombre, recalling the \"Death's bonds\" of the first line of the hymn: Christ's death on the cross and burial.\n\nThe opening stanza, \"\" (Christ lay in death's bonds) is treated as a chorale fantasia. Without instrumental opening, the movement starts with the chorale tune sung by the soprano in very long notes, with all other parts entering soon after the soprano begins each choral statement. The alto line is derived from the chorale tune, while the viola parts principally reinforce the alto and tenor voices. The violin parts are independent and, as Traupman-Carr notes \"further activate the texture with a virtually continuous exchange of sixteenth-note snippets\". The figure in the violins known as (sigh) reflects \"Christ's suffering in the grip of death\".\n\nThe final Halleluja is faster, giving up the fantasia format for a four-part fugue and in motet style, with all instruments doubling the voices. The style of the movement recalls the 16th-century \"stile antico\", although the style is still unmistakably Bach's.\n\nThe second stanza, \"\" (No one could defeat death), is set as a soprano and alto duet, over an ostinato continuo. It deals with \"humanity helpless and paralysed as it awaits God's judgement against sin\". Bach has the music almost freeze on the first words \"\" (death), and the word \"\" (imprisoned) is marked by a sharp dissonance of the soprano and alto. In the Halleluja, the voices imitate each other on long notes in fast succession, creating a sequence of suspensions.\n\nThe third stanza, \"\" (Jesus Christ, God's Son), is a trio of the tenor, two obbligato violins and continuo. The tenor sings the chorale melody almost unchanged. The violins illustrate first how Christ slashes at the enemy. The music stops completely on the word \"nichts\" (nothing). The violins then present in four notes the outline of the cross, and finally the tenor sings a joyful \"Halleluja\" to a virtuoso violin accompaniment.\n\n\"\" (It was a strange battle, that death and life waged), is the center of the symmetrical structure. It is sung by the four voices, accompanied only by the continuo. The alto sings the cantus firmus, transposed by a fifth to B-Dorian, while the other voices follow each other in a fugal \"stretto\" with entries just a beat apart until they fall away one by one. In the final Halleluja in all four voices, the bass descends nearly two octaves.\n\nStanza five, \"\" (Here is the true Easter-lamb), is sung by the bass alone, accompanied at first by a descending chromatic line in the continuo which has been compared to the Crucifixus of the Mass in B minor, but changing to \"a dance-like passage of continuous eighth notes\" when the voice enters. For every line of the stanza, the bass sings a chorale tune, then repeats the words in counterpoint to the part of the tune repeated in the strings, sometimes transposed. Taruskin describes this: \"With its antiphonal exchanges between the singer and the massed strings ... this setting sounds like a parody of a passacaglia-style Venetian opera aria, vintage 1640\". The bass sings the final victorious Hallelujas, spanning two octaves.\n\n\"\" (So we celebrate the high festival), is a duet for soprano and tenor accompanied only by the ostinato continuo. The chorale is shared by the voices, with the soprano singing it in E minor, the tenor in B minor. The movement is a dance of joy: the word \"Wonne\" (joy) is rendered in figuration that Gardiner finds reminiscent of Purcell. Bach incorporates the solemn rhythms of the French overture into this verse, reflecting the presence of the word \"\" (celebrate) in the text. It may be the first time that Bach used these rhythms.\n\nBach's original setting of the final stanza, \"\" (We eat and live well), is lost; it may have been a repeat of the opening chorus. In Leipzig, he supplied a simple four-part setting.\n\nBach's original score is lost. A set of autograph parts has survived and is kept in the Bach-Archiv Leipzig. The parts were copied from the autograph score by six scribes, four of them known by name, including the composer.\n\nA manuscript score by Franz Hauser, dating from c. 1820–1839, is held by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz. It bears a comment on page 178: \"Nach den auf der Thomasschule befindlichen / Original / : Autograph: / Stimmen in Partitur gebracht. / Lp. d 16. Oct. 33. / fHauser\" (After the original autograph parts in the \"Thomasschule\", rendered in a score, Leipzig, 16 October 1833).\n\nThe cantata was first published in 1851 as in the first volume of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA), edited by Moritz Hauptmann. Half a century later a vocal score of the cantata appeared in Novello's Original Octavo Edition, under the title \"Christ Lay in Death's Dark Prison\". The piano reduction was by John E. West, and the translation of the cantata's text by Paul England. In 1905 this vocal score was republished in the United States by H. W. Gray. Henry S. Drinker's translation \"Christ lay by death enshrouded\" appeared in a score edited by Arnold Schering and published by Eulenburg in 1932. In 1967 Schering's score edition was republished by W. W. Norton with an extended introduction and bibliography by Gerhard Herz. Breitkopf & Härtel, the publisher of the BGA, produced various editions of the cantata separately, for instance in 1968 a vocal score with Arno Schönstedt's piano reduction and Charles Sanford Terry's translation (\"Christ lay in Death's grim prison\").\n\nThe New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score in 1985, edited by Alfred Dürr, with the critical commentary published the next year. In 1995 Carus produced a revised edition of Hänssler's 1981 , edited by Reinhold Kubik. Both the Hänssler and the Carus edition contained Jean Lunn's \"Christ lay in death's cold prison\" translation. Carus followed the NBA's \"... in Todes Banden\" spelling for the German title. In 2007 Carus republished their score edition with an introduction by Hans-Joachim Schulze. Bach-digital.de published high-resolution facsimile images of the manuscript parts from the first quarter of the 18th century (partly in Bach's handwriting), and of an early 19th-century score manuscript derived from these performance parts. Also in the 21st century, Serenissima Music published a vocal score of compatible with Kalmus' performance material based on the BGA.\n\nBach's cantatas fell into obscurity after his death and, in the context of their revival, stands out as being recorded early and having been recorded often; as of 2016, the Bach Cantatas Website lists 77 different complete recordings, the earliest dating from 1931. The first recording was a Catalan version arranged by Francesc Pujol with Lluís Millet conducting the Orfeó Català: this 1931 performance was released on three 78 rpm discs by the label \"La Voz de su Amo\" (His Master's Voice) in 1932. The cantata was recorded twice under the direction of Nadia Boulanger, a 1937 version recorded in Paris and a 1938 version recorded in Boston.\n\nThere are several recordings from the decades immediately after the war. Robert Shaw recorded the cantata in 1946 and again in 1959. Günther Ramin conducted the Thomanerchor in 1950, the anniversary of Bach's death. The same year, Fritz Lehmann conducted the choir of the Musikhochschule Frankfurt with soloists Helmut Krebs and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Karl Richter and his Münchener Bach-Chor first recorded it in 1958.\n\nNikolaus Harnoncourt recorded in 1971 in a historically informed performance with original instruments and male singers (the upper two parts are sung by boys and the countertenor Paul Esswood). This was at the start of the first project to record all Bach's sacred cantatas, \"J. S. Bach – Das Kantatenwerk\" on Teldec. has since been included in the other \"complete sets\", conducted by Rilling, Gardiner, Koopman, Leusink, and Suzuki (details of these recordings are given in the discography article).\n\nIn 1926 Walter Rummel published a piano arrangement of the cantata's fourth movement, \"Jesus Christus, Gottes Sohn\". George Copeland recorded this transcription in 1938 (re-issued on CD 2001), and Jonathan Plowright recorded it in 2005.\n\nAfter he had recorded his orchestration of the chorale prelude \"Christ lag in Todesbanden\", BWV 718, in 1931, Leopold Stokowski recorded his arrangement for symphonic orchestra of BWV 4's fourth movement in 1937. As \"Chorale from the Easter cantata Christ lag in Todesbanden\" the arrangement's score was copyrighted in 1950 and published by Broude Brothers. Later the arrangement was also recorded by José Serebrier and Robert Pikler.\n\nIn 2000 the cantata was performed at Eisenach, in the church where Bach was baptised, as part of the Monteverdi Choir's Bach Cantata Pilgrimage (the live recording was released in 2007). \n\nMusic from the cantata was performed as early as 1914 at the Proms (at that time held in the Queen's Hall), although the complete work was not heard in this concert series until 1978, when it was given at St Augustine's church, Kilburn.\n\nThe cantata was successfully staged by English Touring Opera in 2012. It was paired with the opera \"The Emperor of Atlantis\" and arranged by Iain Farrington for the same instrumental forces as the opera (chamber ensemble including instruments not available to Bach such as saxophone).\n\nThe Monteverdi Choir performed the cantata in 2013 in the Royal Albert Hall. This performance, which had audience participation, was part of a nine-hour \"Bach marathon\".\n\n\"General sources\"\n\n\"Editions in English\"\n\n\"Editions\"\n\n\"Books\"\n\n\"Online sources\"\n\n\"Newspapers\"\n\n"}

The series was produced by Belvision Studios and first aired in 1957. After two books were adapted in black and white, eight books were then adapted in colour, each serialised into a set of five-minute episodes, with 103 episodes produced (twelve in black and white and ninety-one in colour).\n\nMost stories in the television series varied widely from the original books, often changing whole plots.\n\nIn Black Island, Captain Haddock plays a leading part, while he was absent in the original book. Professor Calculus makes a cameo. Puschov accuses Tintin of robbing him, but in an airport. Tintin and Haddock hide in post office bags to get to Sussex, but Haddock gets in the wrong bag, and they are separated. Tintin later finds Haddock in England examining the plane. Dr. Müller is older and white-haired, and has a goatee. Ranko doesn't break his arm in this version, and even aids Tintin, Haddock and Snowy. This is the only story in the entire series that also exists in a black-and-white form, in animation mode.\n\nIn The Crab with the Golden Claws, Tintin sees Herbert Dawes being drowned and decides to investigate. In this version, Tintin and Haddock already know each other, whilst in the original book, it is their first meeting. Haddock is drugged with narcotics, rather than whiskey. Instead of opium, diamonds are smuggled in the tins. The main characters have slightly different exploits in the desert. They are attacked by a desert raider named Ahmed the Terrible, and later by the pilot of the seaplane. The ending has also been re-written.\n\nIn Star of Mystery (The Shooting Star), Professor Phostle is replaced with Professor Calculus. In line with this change, the phostlite is renamed \"calculite\". Professor Philippulus is Calculus' assistant, and he predicts the end of the world, but his predictions are wrong. Calculus accompanies Tintin on the meteorite, and the \"Peary\" captain and a crewman chase Tintin and Calculus on the meteorite, but are chased off by the giant spider. Captain Chester has been removed from the storyline, and Thomson and Thompson accompany them on the voyage, whereas in the book they only appeared in one panel.\n\nIn The Secret of the Unicorn, Barnaby and Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine are completely missing from the storyline. Marlinspike Hall has been renamed \"Hudson Manor\". Max Bird escapes in his car, but in this version, he is pursued by Tintin, Haddock, and Thomson and Thompson. They fight him on a pumpkin farmer's truck and pursue him with help from a pilot. Aristides Silk (the pickpocket) has been renamed \"Herbert Knill\".\n\nIn Red Rackham's Treasure, they already know Calculus, who is not hard of hearing. Max Bird follows them, and attacks Tintin underwater and is nearly killed by an octopus. Haddock is the one who meets a shark underwater instead of Tintin. There are natives on the desert island, who bear a strong resemblance to the Arumbayas from \"The Broken Ear\". Thomson and Thompson are saved from losing their heads when Haddock pretends he is the Idol of Sir Francis Haddock speaking, similar to The Broken Ear. The group is captured by natives, but escape when a volcanic eruption sinks the Island (similar to \"Flight 714 to Sydney\"). Max Bird meets them at the Marlinspike Hall after they find the treasure, but they overpower him.\n\nIn Objective Moon (Destination Moon & Explorers on the Moon), the trip to the moon was all about rescuing Snowy, who was trapped in the (now white) test rocket. Captain Haddock's whiskey is replaced with coffee, and when he is pulled into orbit, he is not drunk, but his feet are hurting, so he takes his metal boots off. The tank is replaced with a hovering car called \"the moon mobile\". Professor Calculus, Haddock, and Thomson and Thompson explore the dark side of the moon in it but get trapped by a cave-in caused by a meteor shower. Snowy rescues them by giving them dynamite. Colonel Jorgen and Frank Wolff survive, and at the end, the rocket crashes in the mountains.\n\nThe Calculus Case (The Calculus Affair) was the most altered series, the changes amounting to a completely different story altogether. Jolyon Wagg was entirely removed, and Calculus' ultrasound weapon is called \"Silly the Silent\" (or \"No-Sound Nellie\" in the US English version). Thomson and Thompson's roles have been expanded, and Haddock is captured with Calculus in \"Darkol Prison\". Alfredo Topolino and Colonel Sponsz have been renamed \"Professor Bretzel\" and \"Colonel Brutel\".\n\nMore generally, Tintin's home is located in New York, Captain Haddock does not have a penchant for whiskey (and prefers drinking coffee instead), Professor Calculus does not have hearing problems, Thomson and Thompson are brothers and their moustaches are identical, and Snowy has a red collar.\n\nThe first episode, \"Objective Moon\", makes reference to other earlier stories through Tintin reminiscing. It mentions \"Tintin in the Congo\", \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" and \"The Red Sea Sharks\".\n\n\n\n\nSeason 1: \"Objective Moon\" (22 episodes)\n\nSeason 2: \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" (17 episodes)\n\nSeason 3: \"The Secret of the Unicorn\" (10 episodes)\n\nSeason 4: \"Red Rackham's Treasure\" (17 episodes)\n\nSeason 5: \"The Star of Mystery\" (11 episodes)\n\nSeason 6: \"Black Island\" (12 episodes)\n\nSeason 7: \"The Calculus Case\" (13 episodes)\n\n\n"}

SR 28 has been part of the National Scenic Byway system since September 1996 and the state scenic byway system since June 1994. \n\nSR 28 begins at Spooner Junction, a T intersection with US 50 (also known as the Lincoln Highway) and SR 28 on the border between the Humboldt–Toiyabe National Forest and the Lake Tahoe – Nevada State Park in northwestern Douglas County, just south of Spooner Lake. (US 50 heads west toward Glenbrook, Zephyr Cove, and eventually Sacramento, California. US 50 heads west toward a junction with US 395, Carson City, and Fallon.)\n\nFrom its southern terminus SR 28 heads northwest, initially along the border between the national forest and the state park. After about the highway leaves Douglas County and enters Carson City (independent city) and fully enters the state park.

Founded in 1959, the lab is located in the Berkeley Hills above the university campus. It has developed and continues to develop many projects in the space sciences, including the search for extraterrestrial life (SETI@home).\n\nThe Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) at Berkeley, California was initiated in 1958 by a committee of faculty members who recognized that emerging rocket and satellite technology opened up new investigative realms for the physical, biological, and engineering sciences. The committee, chaired first by Professor Otto Struve of the Department of Astronomy and subsequently by Professor Edward Teller of the Department of Physics and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, explored with faculty members the opportunities associated with space research as well as the impact of rapidly escalating national space exploration programs (i.e. NASA) on graduate study and research. The committee proposed the formation of a Space Sciences Laboratory which, as a campus-wide multidisciplinary organization, would serve to integrate the space sciences on campus and stimulate new faculty-student research programs. The Regents, acting on the recommendation of Chancellor Glenn T. Seaborg and President Clark Kerr, authorized the formation of the Laboratory in 1959.\n\nThe Laboratory began its operations in January 1960 with the appointment of its first director, Professor Samuel Silver. Starting life in a corner of the old Leuschner Observatory on the main campus, the active interest of faculty members in the space sciences led to a rapid deployment of the physical and biological research programs. The modest quarters were soon inadequate for the group of research associates and graduate students. An especially large project on space physiology initiated by Professors Hardin B. Jones and Cornelius A. Tobias required much more space than available on campus, forcing the Laboratory to move to the Ford Assembly Building in Richmond, California, a property acquired by the University several years earlier.\n\nThe space physics program directed by Professor Kinsey A. Anderson and involving experiments carried by balloons, rockets, and satellites quickly outgrew its quarters requiring a move off campus as well. The Laboratory rented a store at 2119 University Avenue, just west of the University, and converted it into a figurative beehive of research activities. At the peak of its use, the \"Market\" (or the \"Shoe Store\") as this facility was known, housed electronic shops, the machine shop, the data processing equipment, environmental test equipment, and research projects on the moon and the planets, the interplanetary medium, and the upper atmosphere of the earth. Also housed here were social scientists who were studying the physical scientists and the problems of organization and administration of research.\n\nThe NASA Facilities Grant precipitated the construction of SSL's original buildings. The growth of multiple programs represented the fulfillment of one of the laboratory's goals, namely to stimulate faculty and student participation in space research. But the second major objective, that of developing the multidisciplinary substance and unique character of space research, could not be realized in a physically fragmented laboratory. With the construction of the new buildings, that goal was finally achieved. The building grant was awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1962 and the building dedicated on Thursday, October 27, 1966.\n\nThe Space Sciences Laboratory is an Organized Research Unit of the University of California, Berkeley. It is led by Berkeley faculty and Senior Fellows at the laboratory, and reports its activities to the Vice Chancellor for Research of UC Berkeley.\n\nIn its early years, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration followed the policy of funding university research on an individual project basis. It was not until 1961, when Mr. James E. Webb became the Administrator of NASA, that the agency formulated a broad and far-reaching program of space research and exploration. The Office of Grants and Research Contracts instituted two programs: the Sustaining Grant Program and the Facilities Program. The Berkeley campus was one of the first universities to receive grants under these two programs.\n\nThe Sustaining Grant, which provided the Space Sciences Laboratory with a core of funds for interdisciplinary research in the physical, biological, engineering, and social sciences, gave the Laboratory a foundation on which to build faculty programs and to generate new areas of graduate training through research. The grant was invaluable in developing the space sciences program on the Berkeley campus.\n\nThe Laboratory is located in a wooded site in the Berkeley Hills. The building is directly adjacent to the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute and slightly above the Lawrence Hall of Science. The architects designed the building to fit the setting with a view of the natural surroundings.\n\nSSL developed and maintains the SETI@home project which pioneered the application of distributed computing to the space sciences.\n\nIt created the related projects Stardust@home and BOINC.\n\nIt is home to the Space Physics Research Group, which does plasma physics research.\n\nIt has developed many satellite missions and serves as a ground station for those missions. Some of the satellites it has developed are:\n\n\nIt does science education outreach via the Center for Science Education (CSE).\n\n"}

In 2020, the holiday will be observed on Thursday, July 23, a one-time move that was made as a special accommodation to support the opening of the Tokyo Olympics. The purpose of the holiday is to give thanks to the ocean's bounty and to consider the importance of the ocean to Japan as an island nation.\n\nMany people take advantage of the holiday and summer weather to take a beach trip. Other ocean-related festivities are observed as well. The date roughly coincides with the end of the rainy season (梅雨 \"tsuyu\") in much of the Japan mainland. \n\nThe day was known as until 1996. Communications Minister Shozo Murata designated the day in 1941 to commemorate the Meiji Emperor and his 1876 voyage in the \"Meiji Maru\", an iron steamship constructed in Scotland in 1874. The voyage included a trip around the Tōhoku region, embarking on a lighthouse boat in Aomori, and a brief stop in Hakodate before returning to Yokohama on July 20 of that year. However, it was not designated a national holiday until 1995, when it became the first holiday in the summer months.\n\nFirst observed on July 20, 1996, the Happy Monday System legislation moved the date to the third Monday of July beginning in 2003.\n\nAs special arrangement for the 2020 Summer Olympics, the 2020 date for Marine Day was moved to July 23. With the Olympics and Paralympics postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government stated on 1 April 2020 that it would leave this change in place for 2020 and submit an amendment to the Olympic and Paralympic Special Measures Act to make a corresponding change to the holiday in 2021.\n\nOn this day, families visit the sea and swim, snorkel, surf, or dive. People may also participate in an event called ‘mud-ball throwing’. Mud-balls are composed of ‘Effective Micro-organisms\" (EMs), which help break-down and eliminate sea grime.

He was a founding member of The Equals, one of the United Kingdom's first racially integrated pop groups. His subsequent solo career included the platinum single \"Electric Avenue\". He also pioneered the genre ringbang.\n\nGrant was born in Plaisance, British Guiana, later moving to Linden. His father, Patrick, was a trumpeter who played in Nello and the Luckies. While at school, his parents lived and worked in the United Kingdom, sending back money for his education. In 1960, he emigrated to join his parents in London. He lived in Kentish Town and went to school at the Acland Burghley Secondary Modern at Tufnell Park, where he learned to read and write music. He became a big fan of Chuck Berry, and after seeing him play at the Finsbury Park Astoria decided on a career in music.\n\nIn 1965, Grant formed the Equals, playing guitar and singing background vocals, and the band had two hit albums and a minor hit with the single \"I Get So Excited\" before having a number one hit in 1968 with his song \"Baby Come Back\". The tune also topped the UK Singles Chart in 1994, when covered by Pato Banton featuring Robin and Ali Campbell of the reggae group UB40. The Equals had five further top 40 hits in the UK up to the end of 1970. The \"Baby Come Back\" album featured a song by Grant titled, \"Police on My Back\" which was recorded by the Clash for their 1980 album \"Sandinista!\". Willie Nile released his version of \"Police on My Back\" on his \"Streets of New York\" CD. The Equals' song \"Green Light\" co-written by Grant from their 1968 album \"Supreme\", was recorded by the Detroit Cobras, for their 2007 album, \"Tied & True\".\n\nIn this period he also worked as a songwriter and producer for other artists, including the Pyramids (producing their debut single \"Train Tour to Rainbow City\") and Prince Buster, for whom he wrote \"Rough Rider\", and started the Torpedo record label, releasing British-made reggae singles.\n\nOn 1 January 1971, Grant suffered a heart attack and collapsed lung, leading to his departure from the Equals to concentrate on production, opening his own Coach House Studios in the grounds of his Stamford Hill home in 1972, and starting Ice Records in 1974, initially distributed by Pye Records and later by Virgin Records. He produced the Pioneers' 1976 album \"Feel the Rhythm\", as well as early recordings by his younger brother Rudy, working under the name the Mexicano. During this time he also branched out of music, learning to tap dance, and subsequently trying his hand at acting at the behest of fellow Guyanese immigrant, actor Norman Beaton.\n\nA self-titled solo album released in 1975 made little impact, as did the proto-soca \"Message Man\", completed and released in 1977, on which Grant played all the instruments himself. His breakthrough as a solo artist came two years later with the album \"Walking on Sunshine\", which spawned the UK top 20 hit \"Living on the Frontline\". He returned to the charts in 1980 with the top 10 hit \"Do You Feel My Love\", the opening track of \"Can't Get Enough\", the 1981 album giving him his first entry in the UK Albums Chart. The album included two further hit singles, \"Can't Get Enough of You\" and \"I Love You, Yes I Love You\".\n\nGrant became based in Barbados from 1982 (where he opened his Blue Wave Studios), the same year releasing his most successful album, \"Killer on the Rampage\", which included his two biggest solo hits, \"I Don't Wanna Dance\", which spent three weeks at number one in the UK as well as selling well internationally, and \"Electric Avenue\", which reached no. 2 in both the UK and the US. He also began producing and promoting local artists such as David Rudder, Mighty Gabby, Tamu Hibbert, and Grynner. \n\nA lean period followed; his 1984 theme song for \"Romancing the Stone\" was cut from the film and stalled outside the UK top 50 when released as a single, although it fared better in the US. His albums \"Going for Broke\" (1984), \"Born Tuff\" (1987), and \"File Under Rock\" (1988) failed to chart and produced no further hit singles. \n\nHe returned to the charts in 1988 with the anti-apartheid single \"Gimme Hope Jo'anna\", a no. 7 hit in the UK. The song was banned by the South African government. In the late 1980s he pursued other business interests including music publishing, and a nightclub, and built up the success of his Blue Wave studio, which was used by the Rolling Stones, Sting, Cliff Richard, and Elvis Costello.\n\nHe continued releasing albums in the 1990s, including \"Barefoot Soldier\" (1990), \"Paintings of the Soul\" (1992), \"Soca Baptism\" (1993), and \"Hearts and Diamonds\" (1999). In 1994 he introduced a new genre, ringbang, at the Barbados Crop Over festival. Grant said of ringbang: \"What ringbang seeks to do is envelop all the rhythms that have originated from Africa so that they become one, defying all geographical boundaries.\" In 2000 he organised the Ringbang Celebration festival in Tobago. In 2001, a remix of \"Electric Avenue\" reached no. 5 in the UK and an attendant Greatest Hits album reached no. 3 in that country.\n\nIn 2006, he released the album \"Reparation\".\n\nIn 2008, Grant performed at Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday concert, and also played several dates in the UK, including the Glastonbury Festival.\n\nIn 2016, it was announced that Grant would receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the government of Guyana.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This white crystalline solid is the anhydride of phosphoric acid. It is a powerful desiccant and dehydrating agent.\n\nPhosphorus pentoxide crystallizes in at least four forms or polymorphs. The most familiar one, a metastable form, shown in the figure, comprises molecules of PO. Weak van der Waals forces hold these molecules together in a hexagonal lattice (However, in spite of the high symmetry of the molecules, the crystal packing is not a close packing). The structure of the PO cage is reminiscent of adamantane with \"T\" symmetry point group. It is closely related to the corresponding anhydride of phosphorous acid, PO. The latter lacks terminal oxo groups. Its density is 2.30 g/cm. It boils at 423 °C under atmospheric pressure; if heated more rapidly it can sublimate. This form can be made by condensing the vapor of phosphorus pentoxide rapidly, the result is an extremely hygroscopic solid.\n\nThe other polymorphs are polymeric, but in each case the phosphorus atoms are bound by a tetrahedron of oxygen atoms, one of which forms a terminal P=O bond involving the donation of the terminal oxygen p-orbital electrons to the antibonding phosphorus-oxygen single bonds. The macromolecular form can be made by heating the compound in a sealed tube for several hours, and maintaining the melt at a high temperature before cooling the melt to the solid. The metastable orthorhombic, \"O\"-form (density 2.72 g/cm, melting point 562 °C), adopts a layered structure consisting of interconnected PO rings, not unlike the structure adopted by certain polysilicates. The stable form is a higher density phase, also orthorhombic, the so-called O' form. It consists of a 3-dimensional framework, density 3.5 g/cm. The remaining polymorph is a glass or amorphous form; it can be made by fusing any of the others.\n\nPO is prepared by burning tetraphosphorus with sufficient supply of oxygen:\nFor most of the 20th century, phosphorus pentoxide was used to provide a supply of concentrated pure phosphoric acid. In the thermal process, the phosphorus pentoxide obtained by burning white phosphorus was dissolved in dilute phosphoric acid to produce concentrated acid. Improvements in filter technology is leading to the \"wet phosphoric acid process\" taking over from the thermal process, obviating the need to produce white phosphorus as a starting material. The dehydration of phosphoric acid to give phosphorus pentoxide is not possible as on heating metaphosphoric acid will boil without losing all its water.\n\nPhosphorus pentoxide is a potent dehydrating agent as indicated by the exothermic nature of its hydrolysis: \n\nHowever, its utility for drying is limited somewhat by its tendency to form a protective viscous coating that inhibits further dehydration by unspent material. A granular form of PO is used in desiccators.\n\nConsistent with its strong desiccating power, PO is used in organic synthesis for dehydration. The most important application is for the conversion of primary amides into nitriles:\nThe indicated coproduct PO(OH) is an idealized formula for undefined products resulting from the hydration of PO.\n\nAlternatively, when combined with a carboxylic acid, the result is the corresponding anhydride:\n\nThe \"Onodera reagent\", a solution of PO in DMSO, is employed for the oxidation of alcohols. This reaction is reminiscent of the Swern oxidation.\n\nThe desiccating power of PO is strong enough to convert many mineral acids to their anhydrides. Examples: HNO is converted to NO;  HSO is converted to SO;  HClO is converted to ClO;  CFSOH is converted to (CF)SO.\n\nBetween the commercially important PO and PO, phosphorus oxides are known with intermediate structures.\n\nPhosphorus pentoxide itself is not flammable. Just like sulfur trioxide, it reacts vigorously with water and water-containing substances like wood or cotton, liberates much heat and may even cause fire due to the highly exothermic nature of such reactions. It is corrosive to metal and is very irritating – it may cause severe burns to the eye, skin, mucous membrane, and respiratory tract even at concentrations as low as 1 mg/m.\n\n\n"}

By all accounts, the recording was rushed, with drummer Mikkey Dee quoted in the 2011 Motörhead book \"Overkill: The Untold Story of Motörhead\":\nLemmy was far kinder to the LP in his autobiography \"White Line Fever\", feeling it \"came out quite nicely\" but admits it was recorded \"all over the place.\" Lemmy recalls that the making of \"Snake Bite Love\" was quite normal for the band: \nHe points particularly to \"Desperate for You\" and \"Night Side\" in this respect and explains how the title track started as a completely different song; Dee recorded the drums tracks against a totally different set of chords, then it went back to Sweden where Campbell stated he was sick of the song and didn't like it. Lemmy agreed and Campbell came up with a new riff and changed the whole thing.

Campbell is jokingly credited in the album's liner notes as an unpronounceable glyph (\"The Artist Frequently Seen at the Liquor Store\"), mocking Prince.\nAgain, this album was not greeted with much fanfare. It continued the late 1990s ambivalence the general public had towards the band. Most of the tracks haven't been played in the live set, with few exceptions.\n\nReviewers have noted the album shows the less heavier side of Motörhead as there are \"one or two too many slower tracks, but it's still heavy for the most part\" and having a mixture of musical ideas, ranging from the true metal of \"Dogs of War\" and \"Assassin\" to rock and roll influenced songs like \"Snake Bite Love\" and \"Don't Lie to Me.\" \n\nAnother view is the album is not as cutting and consistent as the previous effort but sees \"Love for Sale\" as a \"grooving and flowing romp,\" \"Joy of Labour\" having \"plenty of nasty slow riffs,\" and \"Night Side\" as a traditional fast track which will please \"old school\" fans.\n\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls \"Snake Bite Love\":\nIn 2011, Motörhead biographer Joel McIver deemed it \"solid, reliable, and not hugely memorable.\"\n\nPer the \"Snake Bite Love\" liner notes.\n\n\n"}

Comics historian Jerry Bails wrote that Samachson worked as a research chemist for the American Molasses Company until 1938, leaving to become a \"freelance technical writer\".\n\nAs a writer, Samachson translated a number of scientific papers, and in addition to his scientific work, earned a well-deserved reputation as an author, writing books for young people such as \"Mel Oliver and Space Rover on Mars\", which was also published in a Dutch translation.\n\nHe wrote a number of science fiction works (under the pseudonym William Morrison), including two novels published in \"Startling Stories\", the 1937 pulp title \"Murder of a Professor\" and short stories for a number of magazines, including \"Money from Heaven\" (1942). He also penned a couple of \"Captain Future\" pulp novels c.1941–1942 (under the house name \"Brett Sterling\"), and had work appear in the science fiction magazine \"Galaxy\". His young adult novel \"Mel Oliver and Space Rover on Mars\" was published by Gnome Press in 1954.\n\nHe is believed to have begun working for DC Comics in late 1942, working on comics scripts for characters notably including Batman. He also wrote scripts for comics and characters including Sandman, Green Arrow, Airwave and Robotman, as well as \"a string of 17 science-fiction stories in 1955 and 1956\".\n\nIn 1955, he created (with artist Joe Certa) the Martian Manhunter in the pages of \"Detective Comics\" #225. Usually credited as author on the initial strip, some commentators believe that he may have produced the plot, but that writer Jack Miller (who most believe succeeded Samachson in writing the character with the next issue), may have produced the first script. Don Markstein's Toonopedia also suggests that Samachson wrote \"many subsequent\" appearances of J'Onn J'Onzz rather than just the first. Jerry Bails also lists Samachson as having co-created the historical DC character Tomahawk. In 1943 Samachson also created the character Two-Gun Percy, which first appeared under the DC Comics imprint All Funny Comics and was drawn by Bernard Baily.\n\nIn 1975, DC Comics adapted an unused story he wrote in the 1940's featuring the Seven Soldiers of Victory into a six-part serial in Adventure Comics #438-443.\n\nSamachson also wrote scripts for Captain Video and His Video Rangers.\n\nWith his wife Dorothy Samachson, he wrote about theater (\"Let's Meet the Theatre\" and \"The Dramatic Story of the Theatre\"), music (\"Masters of Music\" and \"The Fabulous World of Opera\"), ballet, archeology (\"Good Digging\") and a number of other titles, including \"Rome\", a Rand McNally \"Cities of the World\" title.\n\nIn addition, Samachson was a frequent contributor to scientific journals and the author of \"The Armor Within Us: The Story of Bone.\"\n\n"}

When satisfied, the Samuelson condition implies that further substituting public for private goods (or vice versa) would result in a decrease of social utility.\n\nFor an economy with \"n\" consumers the conditions reads as follows:\n\nMRS is individual \"i\" marginal rate of substitution and MRT is the economy's marginal rate of transformation between the public good and an arbitrarily chosen private good.\n\nIf the private good is a numeraire good then the Samuelson condition can be re-written as:\n\nwhere formula_3 is the marginal benefit to each person of consuming one more unit of the public good, and MC is the marginal cost of providing that good. In other words, the public good should be provided as long as the overall benefits to consumers from that good are at least as great as the cost of providing it. (Remember that public goods are non-rival, so can be enjoyed by many consumers simultaneously). \nWhen written this way, the Samuelson condition has a simple graphic interpretation. Each individual consumer's marginal benefit, formula_3, represents his or her demand for the public good, or willingness to pay. The sum of the marginal benefits represent the aggregate willingness to pay or aggregate demand. The marginal cost is, under competitive market conditions, the supply for public goods. \n\nHence the Samuelson condition can be thought of as a generalization of supply and demand concepts from private to public goods.\n\n\n"}

The film is based on the novel \"Mr. Hobbs' Vacation\"\nby Edward Streeter and features a popular singer of the time, Fabian.\n\nRoger Hobbs is an overworked banker whose wife Peggy plans a quiet seaside vacation with their family, including the grown daughters, teenage son, family cook, sons-in-law and grandchildren.\n\nWhat he finds upon reaching their vacation destination is a very dilapidated beach house.\n\nComplications mount up. His teenage son Danny only wants to watch television. His youngest daughter Katey, embarrassed by a new set of dental braces, refuses to leave the beach house; and his grandchildren do not want to have anything to do with him.\n\nFurthermore, one of his sons-in-law, Stan, is unemployed and Mr. Hobbs must entertain Stan's snooty potential employer on a boring bird-watching jaunt. An older daughter is married to the aloof professor Byron, who has unorthodox ideas about both disciplining children and the family dynamic.\n\nOne by one, Mr. Hobbs tries to solve each problem. After the television breaks, he finds time to take Danny on a boating trip, where they get very lost in the fog but bond as father and son. He also manages to take Katey to a dance, where he bribes a handsome young man named Joe to pay attention to her.\n\nThe bird-watcher and his prim wife don't turn out to be what they seem to be and chaos reigns for a while. But in time Mr. Hobbs and his wife sort out everybody's personal crisis, Joe turns out to be a suitable suitor for Katey, and the family is almost sad to leave the beach and return home.\n\n\nNunnally Johnson wrote the screenplay for \"Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation\" based on Edward Streeter's novel of the same name. Streeter had previously written the novel \"Father of the Bride\", which was filmed in 1950 and remade in 1991.\n\nJohnson had just finished directing a series of films and wanted to focus on writing. He agreed to do \"Hobbs\" because he liked the story \"and I knew something about it.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation\" was filmed in California at Laguna Beach and Dana Point. The film was shot using CinemaScope wide screen formatting, with color by DeLuxe. It marked the first time James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara starred together in a film. They would co-star again in the 1966 western \"The Rare Breed\". During the scene where Mr. Hobbs escorts his daughter Katey to a dance at the yacht club, Herb Alpert is the trumpet player in the band.\n\nThe movie was the first of two James Stewart made with Fabian. \"If anybody’s ever blessed, you have to be blessed to work with Jimmy Stewart,\" recalled Fabian. \"He was the most congenial, helpful person I ever worked with.\"\n\nThe film was relatively successful in the United States and Canada upon its release on June 15, 1962, earning $4 million with an estimated budget of $2 million, but found even greater success when released overseas.\n\nJames Stewart won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival for his performance, and director Henry Koster was nominated for Best Director. Stewart was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy. The screenplay by Nunnally Johnson was nominated for Best Written Comedy by the Writers Guild of America. Stewart and Maureen O'Hara were also nominated for their performances by the Laurel Awards.\n\n\"Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation's\" success inspired a series of light-hearted family comedies written by Johnson. Two of these also starred Stewart and were directed by Koster: \"Take Her, She's Mine\" (1963) and \"Dear Brigitte\" (1965).\n\nThis was the final feature film for actress Marie Wilson.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" writes in his review: \"EDWARD STREETER'S genial thesis that the family unit is perhaps the most anomalous and irritating social arrangement ever devised by so-called civilized man is given amusing illustration in Jerry Wald's film version of \"Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation,\" which arrived at the Paramount yesterday. Right off the bat it is suggested in this wacky domestic report that togetherness is strictly for the birds and that sensible parents, especially elders, should write it out of their books. The Mr. Hobbs of the title, played beguilingly by James Stewart, is very much of this opinion as far as his own brood is concerned.\"\n\n\n"}

Peter Ladefoged transcribes it with the IPA symbol that is normally associated with the retroflex flap, . Although the tongue starts out in a subapical retroflex position, trilling involves the tip of the tongue and causes it to move forward to the alveolar ridge. Thus, the retroflex trill gives a preceding vowel retroflex coloration, like other retroflex consonants, but the vibration itself is not much different from an alveolar trill. Thus, the narrower transcription is also appropriate.\n\nWahgi has a similar trilled allophone of its lateral flap, , but it is voiceless. \n\nWintu and Lardil are other languages with a reported (apico-)retroflex trill where the tongue apex \"approaches\" the hard palate, but it is not subapical, unlike in Toda. The trill has a retroflex flap allophone that occurs between vowels.\n\nSeveral languages have been reported to have trilled retroflex affricates such as and , including Mapudungun, Malagasy and Fijian. However, the exact articulation is seldom clear from descriptions.\n\nIn Fijian, for example, further investigation has revealed that the sound (written ) is seldom trilled but is usually realized as a postalveolar stop instead. In Mapudungun, the sound (written \"tr\") is strongly retroflex, causing and following the subsequent vowel to become retroflex as well.

He served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union between 1942 and 1946 and to the United States between 1946 and 1948.\n\nAn Australian-born Scot, Clark Kerr was born Archibald John Kerr Clark, the son of John Kerr Clark (1838-1910), originally from Lanarkshire, Scotland, and Kate Louisa (1846-1926), daughter of Sir John Struan Robertson, five times Premier of the Colony of New South Wales. His family emigrated to England in 1889. In 1911 he assumed the surname of Kerr in addition to that of Clark.\nHe attended Bath College from 1892 to 1900.\n\nClark Kerr entered the Foreign Service in 1906. Early on, he made the mistake of challenging the Foreign Office over its Egyptian policy. Consequently, he found himself posted to a series of capitals in Latin America. He was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to various Central American republics between 1925 and 1928, to Chile between 1928 and 1930, to Sweden between 1931 and 1934 and to Iraq between 1935 and 1938.\n\nHe distinguished himself enough in these posts to secure a prestigious appointment as Ambassador to China between 1938 and 1942 during the Japanese occupation.\nIn the ensuing years, he developed a close relationship with Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-Shek and spent most of his posting explaining why Britain could not offer him any substantive aid in his struggle against the Japanese invaders.\n\nHe argued for British aid to China based upon humanitarian concerns, the preservation of British economic influence, and the principle of national self-determination. Despite the lack of aid from Britain, he impressed the Chinese with his interest in Confucian philosophy. He also impressed the Chinese with his determination. After the British consulate in Chungking was almost completely destroyed by Japanese bombing in 1940, other diplomatic missions evacuated, but he kept the Union Jack flying close to Chinese government buildings. He regularly swam in the Yangtze River, and after meeting American writer Ernest Hemingway he dismissed him derisively: \"Tough? Why, I'm tougher than he is!\"\n\nHe was moved to Moscow in February 1942 where he forged a remarkable relationship with Stalin and facilitated a number of Anglo-Soviet diplomatic conferences. His work there and at the Big Three Conferences (such as Yalta and Potsdam) put him at the centre of international politics during the final, pivotal years of the Second World War. Throughout his posting in Moscow he sought clearer direction from the Foreign Office in London. Lacking it, he often fell back upon a directive received from Churchill in February 1943: \"You want a directive? All right. I don't mind kissing Stalin's bum, but I'm damned if I'll lick his arse!\"\n\nAs the war neared its end, Kerr became increasingly concerned about Soviet plans for the post-war world. He did not think that they planned to begin spreading world revolution, but he did think that they were preparing to exert their influence well beyond their pre-war sphere of influence. He voiced deep-seated concerns about Soviet expansionism for the first time in a lengthy memorandum on Soviet policy dated 31 August 1944. In the memo, he forecast three likely results of the war: the removal of any immediate threat to Soviet security, the consolidation of Stalin's dominant position, and the Soviet use of Communist Parties in other countries to serve interests of \"Russia as a state as distinct from Russia as a revolutionary notion.\" This closely resembled the conclusions that George F. Kennan included in a telegram to Washington a few months later.\n\nAfter the war Clerk Kerr was appointed Ambassador to the United States, a post he held until 1948. An acquaintance of Guy Burgess and Donald Duart Maclean's superior in Washington, he took their defection to the USSR badly. The affair cast a shadow over Inverchapel's career. He died in 1951.\n\nClark Kerr was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1935 New Year Honours and a Knight Grand Cross in 1942 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1944. In 1946 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Inverchapel, of Loch Eck in the County of Argyll.\n\nLord Inverchapel's personal life has been described as colourful: a close confidant of the Kaiser's sister in the years before the Great War, he was also a disappointed suitor of the Queen Mother before his marriage, divorce, and remarriage, to a Chilean lady 29 years his junior. Politically on the left, a noted wit and unconventional in manner, he was sometimes suspected of excessive understanding for the Soviet position. His biographer, Donald Gillies, considers rumoured pro-Soviet sympathies highly unlikely.\n\nInverchapel is best remembered in the public imagination for a much reproduced note he is said to have written in 1943 to Lord Pembroke while Ambassador to Moscow. A copy of the letter was published in \"The Spectator\" in 1978, with the comment that \"an acquaintance has been delving among the Foreign Office records for the war years\".\n\n\"\"My Dear Reggie,\"\n\n\"In these dark days man tends to look for little shafts of light that spill from Heaven. My days are probably darker than yours, and I need, my God I do, all the light I can get. But I am a decent fellow, and I do not want to be mean and selfish about what little brightness is shed upon me from time to time. So I propose to share with you a tiny flash that has illuminated my sombre life and tell you that God has given me a new Turkish colleague whose card tells me that he is called Mustapha Kunt.\"\n\n\"We all feel like that, Reggie, now and then, especially when Spring is upon us, but few of us would care to put it on our cards. It takes a Turk to do that.\"\n\n\"Sir Archibald Clerk Kerr, \"\n\"H.M.

He died in July 1951, aged 69. The barony died with him as he had no children.\n\n\n"}

He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede.\n\nIn 2009, Uribe signed with the Giants and was again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 2014. Uribe was traded to the Braves in late May of the 2015 season and again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start of spring training in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was injured by a ground ball on June 12, 2016 and was later diagnosed with a testicular contusion. The Indians designated him for assignment on August 1 and released him on August 5.\n\nUribe was born in Palenque, Dominican Republic. Growing up, he became interested in baseball partly due to José Uribe. José was Juan's second cousin, although Juan calls him his \"uncle\" because of their age difference. When Major League Baseball (MLB) was not in season, José would come home to the Dominican Republic and tell Juan about his time in the majors playing shortstop for the San Francisco Giants. Juan proved to have baseball ability too. In 1997, Colorado Rockies scout Jorge Posada, Sr., spotted Uribe while he was scouting pitcher Enemencio Pacheco. Posada offered him a $5,000 contract, but Uribe and his father tried to get a higher amount from agent Bob Michelin. Eventually, Uribe settled for $5,000.\n\nUribe started his professional career playing in the Dominican Summer League (DSL) for the DSL Rockies. In 1998 and 1999, he played for the rookie-level Arizona Rookie League and the Single-A Asheville Tourists in the South Atlantic League. While in Asheville, he batted .392 with 28 doubles, compiling a 15-game hitting streak at one point in the season. Uribe played for the Single-A advanced Salem Avalanche of the Carolina League in 2000, batting .256 with 13 home runs. Following the season, \"Baseball America\" named him the number two prospect in the Rockies' organization. In 2001, he was called up by the Rockies.\n\nUribe played 72 games for the Rockies in his rookie season of 2001. He batted .300, had eight home runs, and had 53 runs batted in (RBIs). He also had 11 triples, tying a club record held by Neifi Pérez and Juan Pierre. He made his major league debut on April 8, pinch-hitting and striking out against Jay Witasick in an 11–3 loss to the San Diego Padres. Three days later, he had his first major league hit against Matt Morris in a 3–1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. He was sent down to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific Coast League a few times during the season. However, after July 25 he took over the shortstop position for the Rockies when they traded Pérez. On August 2, he hit his first major league home run against Dave Coggin in a 4–2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. He tied three other franchise records with two hits, two extra base hits, and six total bases in a single inning during an October 7 game against the San Diego Padres.\n\nUribe played his first full season in the majors for the Rockies in 2002. He started 150 games at shortstop, posting a .240 average, six home runs, 49 RBIs, and 25 doubles. He had a 17-game hitting streak during the months of April and May, a career high. However, his offensive production slumped from May through August, and he also played poor defensive, leading the team with 27 errors. Uribe saw a little improvement offensively late in the season, though, as he tied a career high for hits in a game with four on September 17 in a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; he finished that game a home run short of the cycle.\n\nIn 2003, Uribe did not play until June 3 because of an injury suffered when he was rounding the bases during a spring training game on March 1. In his first game back, he homered twice against Ricardo Rodríguez of the Cleveland Indians. He began to play in the outfield for the Rockies, starting at center field on June 15. However, he returned to the shortstop position when José Hernández was traded. In 87 games, he batted .253 with 80 hits, 19 doubles, 10 home runs, and 33 RBIs. Uribe was traded to the Chicago White Sox on December 2, 2003, for Aaron Miles.\n\nAlthough Uribe did not have a starting role at the beginning of his tenure with the White Sox, he wound up appearing in 134 games for them in 2004, playing second base, shortstop, and third base. On June 19, he had seven RBIs (one short of the White Sox single-game record) in a 17–14 loss to the Montreal Expos. He set many career highs in batting categories, including batting average with the bases loaded (.556), RISP (.340), batting average (.283), home runs (23), RBIs (74), hits (142), and runs (82). He played much better at home, batting .315 with six home runs compared to .248 with seven home runs on the road. On December 16, he agreed to a contract extension through 2008 with the White Sox.\n\nIn 2005, Uribe spent the entire season playing shortstop after the White Sox did not re-sign José Valentín. In 146 games, a number that would have been higher had it not been for minor injuries, Uribe batted .252 with 121 hits, 23 doubles, 16 home runs, and 74 RBIs. In Game 1 of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Uribe hit a home run and had three RBIs as the White Sox defeated the Boston Red Sox 14–2. Uribe made two memorable defensive plays for the final two outs of the 2005 World Series, first catching a ball while crashing into the third base stands and then ranging over the middle and firing an off-balance throw on a slow grounder to beat Houston Astro Orlando Palmeiro to give the White Sox their first title in 88 years.\n\nOn July 2, 2006, Uribe had five RBIs in a 15–11 loss to the Chicago Cubs; two days later, he again had five RBIs in a 13–0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Uribe had one of his best power seasons in 2006, batting .235 with 21 home runs and 71 RBIs in 132 games. However, he had the lowest on-base percentage of his career, at .257. Injuries prevented him from appearing 10 games, and he also lost some starts at shortstop to Alex Cintrón because of his low on-base percentage. He led the White Sox in sacrifice hits and ranked fourth in the AL with a .977 fielding percentage. He also joined Derek Jeter, Miguel Tejada, Édgar Rentería, and Michael Young as the only shortstops to top 70 RBIs in 2004, 2005, and 2006.\n\nOn September 29, 2007, Uribe had a walkoff RBI single against Fernando Rodney to give the White Sox a 3–2 win over the Detroit Tigers. In 150 games in 2007, Uribe batted .234 with 120 hits, 18 doubles, 20 home runs, and 68 RBIs. He was second in the league in fielding percentage (.976), but he batted .198 with runners in scoring position. The White Sox declined Uribe's option, but on November 7, 2007, they signed him to a one-year, $4.5 million deal.\n\nThe White Sox acquired Orlando Cabrera to play shortstop in 2008, forcing Uribe to compete with Alexei Ramírez, Danny Richar, and Pablo Ozuna for the position in spring training. Uribe won the second base job, but after an injury in May, Uribe lost his spot in the White Sox starting lineup to Ramírez. However, Uribe took over third base from Josh Fields (who had spent a week filling in for an injured Joe Crede) on August 1. In 110 games (324 at-bats), Uribe had 80 hits, 22 doubles, seven home runs, and 40 RBIs. On October 30, Uribe filed for free agency.\n\nWhile with the White Sox, Uribe was always regarded as a talented player. He was especially adept at fielding and hitting home runs. However, Ozzie Guillén had issues with Uribe's low on-base percentage and his conditioning.\n\nOn January 29, 2009, Uribe signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. It was announced on April 4 that Uribe had made the Giants final roster as a utility player. Uribe wound up making a lot of starts at second base, shortstop, and third base throughout the season. On July 10, Uribe bobbled a ground ball with one out in the eighth inning of Jonathan Sánchez's no-hitter against San Diego, allowing Chase Headley to reach first base. The effort had been perfect up to that point, and Sánchez went on to retire each of the remaining five batters, meaning this error lost the first perfect game since Randy Johnson 's in 2004. This was the first no-hit, no-walk, no–hit batsman game that was not also a perfect game since Terry Mulholland's no-hitter in 1990. In 122 games (398 at-bats), Uribe batted .289 (his highest average since 2001) with 115 hits, 26 doubles, 16 home runs, and 55 RBIs.\n\nIn 2010, Uribe re-signed a one-year, $3.25 million contract with the Giants. He began 2010 as the Giants' second baseman because of an injury to Freddy Sanchez. At the beginning of May, he moved over to shortstop to replace the injured Rentería; for most of the remainder of the season, he was the Giants' starting shortstop. He hit a game-winning two-run home run on September 5 against Jonathan Broxton, turning a 4–3 deficit into a 5–4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 23, Uribe hit a grand slam against Ryan Dempster and a two-run home run in the second inning against the Cubs for a total of six RBIs, helping the Giants win 13–0.\n\nHe finished the season batting .256 with a career-high 24 home runs and a career-high 85 RBIs. He had 129 hits on the year in 521 at-bats, bringing his career hit total above the 1,000 mark. He had 24 doubles and 2 triples. In Game 4 of the National League Championship Series against the Phillies on October 20, Uribe had a walk-off sacrifice fly against Roy Oswalt in a 6–5 victory. In Game 6, on October 23, he hit a go-ahead solo home run against Ryan Madson in the top of the eighth, which gave the Giants a 3–2 victory, sending them to the World Series. In Game 1 of the World Series on October 27, he hit a three-run home run against Darren O'Day which proved decisive in the Giants' 11–7 victory over the Texas Rangers. He produced an RBI that made it 2–0 against C. J. Wilson in the seventh inning of Game 2; he added another RBI in the eighth as the Giants won 9–0. The Giants won the series in five games, and Uribe earned his second World Series championship.\n\nAfter the 2010 season, Uribe reached an agreement on a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. His first season with the Dodgers was one of his worst seasons as he made two trips to the disabled list and only managed to appear in 77 of 162 games, his fewest games since 2001. His production was the weakest of his career, as he hit a subpar .204 with four home runs and 28 RBIs. He was placed on the disabled list on July 30, with what was described as abdominal pain. He was expected to return after 15 days, but the injury didn't get better and was recharacterized as a sports hernia, which needed season-ending surgery.\n\nIn the 2012 season, Uribe mostly stayed healthy but his production remained similar to his 2011 totals. From May 14 to June 10, he was on the disabled list with a left wrist injury. After June, he lost his starting role and was relegated to pinch-hitting duties over the second half of the season. He played in just 66 games and hit only .191 (his lowest career total) with two home runs and 17 RBIs.\n\nUribe began 2013 as a utility player. However, he made frequent starts at third base, and by June, he had taken over the position. On July 5, Uribe had seven RBIs and was a single short of hitting for the cycle in a 10–2 victory over the Giants.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, Uribe went four for four and homered in each of his first three trips to the plate against the Arizona Diamondbacks. It was his first 3 home run game in the Major Leagues. He played in 132 games for the Dodgers in 2013, almost as many as his first two seasons with them combined (143). He hit .278 with 12 homers and 50 RBI. On October 7, during Game 4 of the NLDS, Uribe hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the 8th inning to put Los Angeles ahead of the Atlanta Braves 4–3. The Dodgers held on to defeat the Braves and took the series 3–1.\n\nOn December 14, 2013, Uribe agreed to a 2-year, $15 million contract extension with the Dodgers.\n\nUribe continued his resurgence in 2014, hitting .311 in 103 games. He also had 9 home runs and 54 RBIs. Uribe was well-liked by his teammates, and hailed as a key part of maintaining clubhouse chemistry. Don Mattingly let him manage the Dodgers for the final game of the regular season, a 10–5 Dodgers win.\n\nUribe started slowly in 2015 and wound up falling behind both Justin Turner and Alex Guerrero on the depth chart. In 29 games he hit .247 with one homer and six RBIs.\n\nOn May 27, 2015, Uribe was traded to the Atlanta Braves (with Chris Withrow) in exchange for Alberto Callaspo, Eric Stults, Ian Thomas and Juan Jaime. The trade was finalized during the Braves' three-game series at Dodger Stadium, and Uribe appeared in his new team's uniform in the third game, going 0 for 3 in the Atlanta win. When asked for an opinion on the trade, Uribe commented, \"I would've felt bad if they traded me to a soccer, basketball or football team. But it's another baseball team, so I'm happy\". Uribe's popularity as a Dodger extended past his trade, as a scheduled bobblehead night went ahead as planned after he had left the team for the Braves.\n\nOn July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Uribe and Kelly Johnson to the New York Mets for John Gant and Rob Whalen. During his second game with New York, Uribe hit the walk-off single in the tenth inning to win the game for the Mets, 3–2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Uribe missed the National League Division Series and National League Championship Series due to a chest contusion in September, but was added to the Mets' World Series roster and came off the bench in the sixth inning of Game 3 to deliver a pinch-hit single, driving in a run. The Mets would lose the series in 5 games to the Royals.\n\nJust before the start of spring training 2016, Uribe signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the Cleveland Indians. On June 12, 2016 in Anaheim, Uribe had to be carted off the field after being hit in the crotch by a ground ball which came off the bat of Mike Trout at . He was later diagnosed with a testicular contusion. He was designated for assignment on August 1, 2016 and released on August 5.\n\nUribe and his wife Ana have four children: Juan Luis, Juanny, Janny, and Johanny. He also has a brother named Elpidio. Uribe does not speak particularly good English, so he used a translator throughout his career when conducting interviews. He plays winter baseball in the Dominican Republic every year. He has done work for many different charity organizations. In 2004, he read to children on the Golden Apple Foundation Bus. He also helped with the United States military children's coloring contest.\n\nIn October 2006, Uribe was alleged to have been involved in a shooting in his native Dominican Republic. A farmer named Antonio Gonzalez Perez accused Uribe of wounding him with a pellet gun. Despite claims by the San Cristóbal Province District Attorney that there was no firm evidence that Uribe was involved in the incident, a judge decided to press forward with the case. Although a defense motion to bar him from leaving the country was rejected, it was ruled on January 5, 2007, that Uribe must appear before a court on the 15 and the 30 of every month until the case was resolved. Uribe, who denied any involvement in the case, suggested that he might not play baseball until the legal proceedings were concluded. He was confident that he would win in court, and the White Sox expected him to be free for spring training. In February, his name was cleared of any involvement with the shooting, and the court ruled he no longer had to appear on the 15 and 30 of every month. Uribe called the incident \"blackmail\", saying it was an attempt by Perez to get money from him.\n"}

A lay analyst and early follower of Carl Jung, Oppenheim was also the founder and editor of \"The Seven Arts\", an important early 20th-century literary magazine.\n\nHe was a well-known writer of short stories and novels. His poetry followed Walt Whitman's model of free verse ruminations on \"social and democratic aspects of life\". Oppenheim depicted labor troubles with Fabian and suffragist themes in his novel, \"The Nine-Tenths\" (1911) and in his famous poem \"Bread and Roses\",(1911), inspired by a speech given by Helen Todd.\nThe slogan \"Bread and Roses\" is now commonly associated with the pivotal 1912 textile workers' strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The poem was later set to music in 1976 by Mimi Fariña and again in 1990 by John Denver.\n\nOppenheim's published works include \"Monday Morning and Other Poems\" (1909); \"Pay Envelopes\" (1911); \"The Nine-Tenths\"(1911); \"The Olympian\" (1912); \"Idle Wives\" (1914); \"Songs For The New Age\" (1914); \"The Beloved\" (1915); \"War and Laughter\" (1916); \"The Book Of Self\" (1917); \"The Solitary\" (1919); \"The Mystic Warrior\" (1921); \"Golden Bird\" (1923); \"The Sea\" (collected poetry – 1924); \"Behind Your Front\" (1926); and \"American Types: A Preface To Analytic Psychology\" (1931). Additionally, he contributed short stories, articles, and poems to \"American Magazine\", \"American Mercury\", \"Century\", \"Collier's\", \"Freeman\", \"Harper's\", \"Hearst's\", \"New Republic\", and \"The Thinker\".\n\nAt \"The Seven Arts\" magazine he served as primary editor and worked with Waldo Frank, George Jean Nathan, Louis Untermeyer and Paul Rosenfeld from 1916–17, until he was blacklisted due to his opposition to US entry into World War I. James Oppenheim later wrote a reminiscence of his one tumultuous year as editor of the journal in which he observed that Randolph Bourne “was the real leader. . . of what brains and creativeness we had at the time and had he lived the ‘twenties might have sparkled much more than they did. Mind you, this young man not only was a cripple, but wheezed in breathing, and was mortally physically afraid most of the time. More than that, he had one fear greater than any other. That was the fear of prison. He could hardly bear the thought of it.” However, Bourne wrote six anti-war articles for the magazine in the teeth of these frailties and fears. Then “the air began to get hot, pro and con, mainly pro” but Oppenheim also found himself the object of surveillance. “The illusion of a ‘free country’ in which I had grown up simply exploded. It was something in those days to know one was shadowed, spied upon, trailed by snoopers, that one must whisper what one thought in a restaurant and even then be sure one's friend wasn't going to hand one over to the police. . . . The lying propaganda had something foul and degrading in it. The exultation of the timorous stay-at-homes was rotten and debased. “Enemies Within,” shrieked the old New York \"Tribune\" and spat snake's venom at Bourne and the rest of us.” The circulation was actually climbing when “the inevitable happened. The contract stipulated that there should be no interference from the business side. However, our backer, clerking still [i.e., the rich backer worked as a clerk to dispel her boredom], was mortally terrified not only by the danger we found ourselves in, but by the word treason. She was of good old American stock, and besides, relatives of hers owned a great food industry. They pressed her hard. She came to me and said we would have to lay off the war, or there would be no more subsidy. There was no more subsidy. . . . But I wouldn’t have missed that year for kingdom come.” \n\nNotable writers who contributed to the magazine under his guidance included Sherwood Anderson, Van Wyck Brooks, Max Eastman, Robert Frost, D.H. Lawrence, Vachel Lindsay and Amy Lowell.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nOppenheim was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 24, 1882, the son of Joseph and Matilda (Schloss) Oppenheim. His father died when he was six and his family's circumstances changed. He was educated in public schools and at Columbia University.\n\nOppenheim married Lucy Seckel and had two children, Ralph and James Jr. (alias Garrett). Seckel filed for divorce following the publication of his 1914 novel, \"Idle Wives\".\n\nOppenheim was assistant head worker at the Hudson Guild Settlement in New York from 1901-03. He then worked as a teacher and acting superintendent at the Hebrew Technical School For Girls in New York from 1905-07. After the collapse of \"The Seven Arts\", he studied and wrote about psychology, in particular the works of Carl Jung. Oppenheim died in New York City on August 4, 1932.\n\n\"Who Was Who,\" Volume I, (copyright 1943).\n"}

It is used in standard crossings for structural stability; and in traditional and contemporary Asian and Western landscape design across water gardens.\n\nWhen constructed of wood, each segment is formed from planks and is supported by posts. When constructed of stone, the bridge will use short or long rectilinear slabs set upon stone footings.\n\nA zig-zag bridge is often seen in the Chinese garden, Japanese garden, and Zen rock garden. It may be made of stone slabs or planks as part of a pond design and is frequently seen in rustic gardens. It is also used in \"high art\" modern fountain gardens, often in public urban park and botanic garden landscapes.\n\nThe objective in employing such a bridge, constructed according to Zen philosophy and teachings, is to focus the walker's attention to the mindfulness of the current place and time moment - \"\"being here, now\"\". As it often has no railings, it is quite possible for an inattentive walker to simply fall off an end into the water.\n\nThe zig-zag of paths and bridges also follows a principle of Chinese Feng Shui.\n\nThe post and plank version has an advantage when employed as a crossing of a muddy bottom or marsh: It is structurally stable, where a straight bridge might tend to tip due to the posts moving in the soft mud. Each segment of walkway mutually supports the next from twisting and tipping by being securely fastened to it. This is the same advantage possessed by a zig-zag split rail fence.\n\n\n"}

It was released on March 19, 1996 by Warner Bros. Records. The album is the soundtrack to the Spike Lee film of the same name. \"Girl 6\" consists of mostly previously released songs from Prince and related artists such as the Family, Vanity 6, and the New Power Generation. The three previously unreleased tracks are \"She Spoke 2 Me\" (recorded in 1991–1992), \"Don't Talk 2 Strangers\" (recorded in 1992, during sessions for the proposed \"I'll Do Anything\" soundtrack) and \"Girl 6\", which was newly recorded for the soundtrack.\n\nThe title track was released as a single, backed with \"Nasty Girl\" by Vanity 6.\n\n\"She Spoke 2 Me\" is a jazzy number, recorded with the NPG in 1991–1992, possibly for the \"Love Symbol Album\". The song is delivered in falsetto vocals and features The NPG horn section. The song was later released in an extended version on 1999's \"\" that extends the song with several minutes of jazzy instrumentations. \"Don't Talk 2 Strangers\" was recorded in 1992 for the proposed \"I'll Do Anything\" soundtrack. Prince was commissioned to write the soundtrack for the film (a musical comedy at that time) and the film's actors were to sing his songs. In an early screening, the film was heavily panned. As a result, the film was re-done as a non-musical and Prince's music was pulled. The track is a gentle number, originally set for a mother to be sung to her daughter. The ballad features little more than piano, and was delivered in falsetto. \"Don't Talk 2 Strangers\" was later covered by Chaka Khan on her 1998 Prince collaboration \"Come 2 My House\". The newly written \"Girl 6\" is a poppy number with elements of hip-hop such as scratching and sampling (bits from the film, as well as Prince hits).

At two months of age, she moved with her mother to the United States. She lived with her grandmother in Cleveland, Ohio, and Palm Beach, Florida, for the first four years of her life while her mother attended Columbia University in New York City. When her mother married Douglas McKee, King went to live with them in Forest Hills, Queens.\n\nAs a teenager, King attended the progressive Edgewood School in Greenwich, Connecticut, a northern campus of Marietta Johnson's Organic School of Education. Playing Juliet in a school production when she was 14, she was asked to audition for a role in a Lee Shubert play, which led to other stage work.\n\nAndrea King appeared in Broadway plays and other theater work. Her Broadway credits included \"Fly Away Home\" (1935) and \"Growing Pains\" (1933). She also appeared as Mary Skinner in \"Life with Father\". Her film debut was in a docudrama, The March of Time's first feature-length film titled \"The Ramparts We Watch\" (1940). In 1944, she signed with Warner Bros. and changed her stage name to King (some of her early movies have her credited as \"Georgette McKee\", her stepfather's name). King appeared uncredited in the Bette Davis film \"Mr. Skeffington\" (1944), followed by another ten movies in the next three years. The Warner Bros. studio photographers voted King the most photogenic actress for the year 1945.\n\nShe co-starred in the mystery-horror film, \"The Beast with Five Fingers\" (1946), and a drama, \"The Man I Love\" (1947), both opposite Robert Alda. King was originally cast to play Dr. Lilith Ritter in \"Nightmare Alley\", a film noir directed by Edmund Goulding, but she chose instead the role of the sophisticated Marjorie Lundeen in \"Ride the Pink Horse\" (1947).\n\nIn the 1950s, King had leading roles in the film noirs \"Dial 1119\" and \"Southside 1-1000\" (both 1950) and a science-fiction story, \"Red Planet Mars\" (1952). She later played supporting roles in Hollywood feature films like \"The World in His Arms\" (1952) with Gregory Peck and \"Band of Angels\" (1957) with Clark Gable.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, most of her acting work was on television, including the ABC/Warner Brothers Television western series \"Maverick\" episode \"Two Tickets to Ten Strike\" opposite James Garner. In 1959–1960, King appeared twice as \"Duchess\" in the episodes \"The Blizzard\" and \"The Devil Made Fire\" of another ABC/WB western series, \"The Alaskans\", starring Roger Moore, Jeff York, Ray Danton, and Dorothy Provine, as well as in multiple episodes of the ABC/WB private-eye series \"77 Sunset Strip\" and \"Hawaiian Eye\".\n\nShe made four guest appearances on \"Perry Mason\" between 1959–1963, including the role of murderer Barbara Heywood in the 1959 episode, \"The Case of the Bedeviled Doctor\". King continued to act on television until 1990 when she played her final role on the \"Murder, She Wrote\" episode, \"The Fixer-Upper\". She appeared twice more as herself on the A&E series, \"Biography\", recalling her work with Peter Lorre and Montgomery Clift.\n\nFor her contribution to television she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 1960.\n\nAccording to her \"Los Angeles Times\" obituary, King was married to lawyer Nat Willis from 1940 until his death in 1970. In her later life, she authored children's books and was active in Democratic politics. During the 1952 presidential election, she supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson. She was an Episcopalian.\n\nOn April 22, 2003, King died in hospice care while in residence at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by a daughter and three grandchildren.\n\n"}

Ewen Edward Samuel Montagu, CBE, QC, DL, RNR (19 March 1901 – 19 July 1985) was a British judge, writer and Naval intelligence officer. He is well known for his leading role in Operation Mincemeat, a critical military deception operation which misdirected German forces' attention away from the Allied Invasion of Sicily in Operation Husky.\n\nMontagu was born in 1901, the second son of Gladys Helen Rachel (Goldsmid) and Louis Montagu, 2nd Baron Swaythling. His family was Jewish. He was educated at Westminster School before becoming a machine gun instructor during the First World War at a United States Naval Air Station. After the war he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge and at Harvard University before he was called to the bar in 1924. One of his more celebrated cases as a junior barrister was the defence of Alma Rattenbury in \n\n1935 against a charge of murdering her elderly husband at the Villa Madeira in Bournemouth.\n\nMontagu was a keen yachtsman, and enlisted in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1938. Because of his legal background he was reassigned to specialized study. From there he was assigned to the Royal Navy's Humberside headquarters at Hull as an assistant staff officer in intelligence. Montagu served in the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander RNVR. He was the Naval Representative on the XX Committee, which oversaw the running of double agents. While Commanding Officer of NID 17M, he and Squadron Leader Charles Cholmondely RAFVR conceived Operation Mincemeat, a major deception operation. Montagu had the idea of having a corpse dressed as a British officer wash ashore in Spain, carrying faked papers revealing plans for invasion of Greece (the real target was Sicily). The location chosen was where pro-German Spanish officials would show the papers to German agents. Montagu also manufactured an entire false identity for the corpse to have in his pockets: military ID, theatre ticket stubs, love letters and a photo of his fiancée, bills from a tailor and jeweller.\n\nThe Germans were fooled completely. German documents found after the war showed that the false information went all the way to Hitler's headquarters, and led to German forces being diverted to Greece. The invasion of Sicily was a success. Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper called it the best deception in the history of military deception. For his role in Operation Mincemeat, Montagu was appointed to the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1973 he held the position of Judge Advocate of the Fleet. He wrote \"The Man Who Never Was\" (1953), an account of Operation Mincemeat, which was made into a movie three years later. Montagu himself appeared in the film adaptation of \"The Man Who Never Was\", playing an Air-Vice Marshal who had in real life disparaged his own character (played by Clifton Webb) in a briefing. Montagu also wrote \"Beyond Top Secret Ultra\", which focused more on the information technology and espionage tactics used in World War II.\n\nHe was a governor of a public health project, the Peckham Experiment, in 1949.\n\nMontagu was president of the United Synagogue, 1954–62, and President of the Anglo-Jewish Association from December 1949.\n\nBefore the Courts Act 1971 he was Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for the Middlesex area of Greater London and recorder in the County of Hampshire. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Southampton.\n\nMontagu's youngest brother Ivor Montagu was a film maker and Communist.\n\nEwen Montagu married Iris, the daughter of the painter Solomon J. Solomon, in 1923. They had a son, Jeremy, who became an authority on musical instruments, and a daughter, Jennifer, who became an art historian.\n\n"}

{"id": "2229866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229866", "title": "Walking Liberty half dollar", "text": "Walking Liberty half dollar\n\nThe Walking Liberty half dollar is a silver 50-cent piece or half dollar coin that was issued by the United States Mint from 1916 to 1947; it was designed by Adolph A. Weinman, a well-known sculptor and engraver.\n\nIn 1915, the new Mint Director, Robert W. Woolley, came to believe that he was not only allowed but required by law to replace coin designs that had been in use for 25 years. He therefore began the process of replacing the Barber coinage: dimes, quarters, and half dollars, all bearing similar designs by long-time Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber, and first struck in 1892. Woolley had the Commission of Fine Arts conduct a competition, as a result of which Weinman was selected to design the dime and half dollar.\n\nWeinman's design of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the half dollar proved difficult to perfect, and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo, whose department included the Mint, considered having Barber create his own design. Mint officials were successful in getting Weinman's design into production, although it never struck very well, which may have been a factor in its replacement by the Franklin half dollar beginning in 1948. Nevertheless, art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the piece to be among the most beautiful US coins. Since 1986, a modification of Weinman's obverse design has been used for the American Silver Eagle, and the half dollar was issued in gold for its centennial in 2016.\n\nOn , the United States Congress passed an act providing:\n\nThe Barber coinage was introduced in 1892; dimes, quarter dollars, and half dollars with similar designs by Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber. The new pieces attracted considerable public dissatisfaction. Beginning in 1905, successive presidential administrations had attempted to bring modern, beautiful designs to United States coins. Following the redesign of the double eagle, eagle, half eagle and quarter eagle in 1907 and 1908, as well as the cent and nickel redesigns of 1909 and 1913 respectively, advocates of replacing the Barber coins began to push for the change when the coins' minimum term expired in 1916. As early as 1914, Victor David Brenner, designer of the Lincoln cent, submitted unsolicited designs for the silver coins. He was told in response that Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo was completely occupied with other matters.\n\nOn , an interview with Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce appeared in the \"Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record\":\n\nIn January 1915, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury William P. Malburn sent McAdoo a memorandum about the silver subsidiary coinage, noting that \"the present silver half dollar, quarter, and dime were changed in 1892, and a new design may, therefore, be adopted in 1916. This can be done any time in the year.\" In reply, McAdoo wrote \"let the mint submit designs before we try anyone else\" on the memorandum.\n\nIn April 1915, Robert W. Woolley took office as Mint Director. On , he asked Joyce to request Engraver Barber, then in his 36th year in office, to prepare new designs. The same day, Malburn requested the opinion of the Treasury Department's Solicitor concerning the Mint view that it could strike new designs for the three denominations in 1916. On , the Solicitor's Office responded that the Mint could change the designs. At the time, the Mint was intensely busy producing the Panama-Pacific commemorative coin issue, and immediate action was not taken. In October, Barber was summoned to Washington to discuss coin designs with Woolley, although it is uncertain whether or not he had by then prepared sketches for the new coinage.\n\nOn , Woolley met with the Commission of Fine Arts. Woolley asked the Commission to view sketches produced by the Mint's engraving department. Barber was present to explain the coinage process to the Commission members. Woolley suggested to the members that if they did not like the Mint's work, they should select sculptors to submit designs for the new pieces. It was Woolley's intent to have distinct designs for the dime, quarter and half dollar—previously, the three pieces had been near-identical. The director informed the Commission that as the existing coinage had been in use for 25 years, it would have to be changed—which numismatic historian David Lange calls a \"misinterpretation of the coinage laws\".\n\nThe Commission disliked the sketches from the Mint (submitted by Barber) and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman, Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek to submit proposals for the new coins. The sculptors could submit multiple sketches. Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor, the designs were not fully interchangeable—by statute, an eagle had to appear on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime. Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece.\nThe three sculptors submitted design sketches in mid-February, and on met with Woolley in New York City to make presentations of their work and answer his questions. After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo, Weinman was notified on that five of his sketches had been selected—for the dime and half dollar, and the reverse of the quarter. The same day, Woolley wrote to MacNeil to tell him he would sculpt the quarter's obverse, and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success. Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist, and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter, subject to the sculptor producing a design satisfactory to Woolley.\n\nOn , the new coins were publicly announced, with the Treasury noting, \"[d]esigns of these coins must be changed by law every 25 years and the present 25-year period ends with 1916.\" The press release indicated that the Treasury hoped production of the new coins would begin in about two months, once the designs were finalized. The same day, Woolley wrote to Mint Engraver Barber, telling him that his sketches were rejected and that models from Weinman and MacNeil would arrive at the Philadelphia Mint no later than . According to numismatic historian Walter Breen, Barber became \"sullen and totally uncooperative\". Lange notes that \"numerous delays were encountered as the artists fine-tuned their models while simultaneously avoiding obstacles thrown in their path by Barber. While his observations regarding many aspects of practical coinage were quite accurate, they clearly could have been presented in a more constructive manner.\" In his book on Mercury dimes, Lange notes that Barber, by then aged 75, had been \"compelled over the past ten years to participate in the systematic undoing of a lifetime's achievements\"; he had to participate in the process which resulted in coins designed by others replacing ones designed by him.\n\nWith the new pieces, all American coins would have had a recent change of design (the Morgan dollar was not then being struck). According to a column in \"The Art World\" magazine later in 1916,\n\nAccording to Secretary McAdoo in his 1916 annual report,\n\nWeinman's obverse bears a resemblance to Oscar Roty's \"Sower\" design for French coins; according to numismatic historian Roger Burdette \"Weinman has taken the ideal of a nineteenth century provincial figure and turned it into an American icon\". Burdette ties both the appearance of the head of Liberty and of the branches which she carries to Baltimore's \"Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument\", designed by Weinman. The sculptor may also have drawn inspiration from a 1913 bust he did of his tenant, Elsie Stevens, wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens. Elsie Stevens is generally believed to have been a model for Weinman's Mercury dime; her daughter Holly wrote in 1966 that her mother had been the model for both coins. The reverse is similar to Weinman's medal for the American Institute of Architects, although the sculptor replaced the laurel on the medal with a pine sapling. Weinman's work on the medal had been widely admired for the power of the depicted eagle.\nBreen, in his comprehensive volume on US coins, said of the half dollar \"Ms. Liberty wears the American flag, anticipating a rebellious counterculture by half a century\". Though admiring the piece generally, he noted that Liberty is striding towards the east, that is towards war-torn Europe, and wrote \"she points into the sky at nothing visible (perhaps aiming a warning at German warplanes?)\" Breen objects to the use of the mountain pine on the reverse, calling it not particularly American nor especially notable except for an ability to thrive near the tree line.\n\nArt historian Cornelius Vermeule wrote that the Walking Liberty half dollar \"really treat[s] the obverse and reverse as a surface sculptural ensemble. The 'Walking Liberty' design particularly gives the true feeling of breath and sculptural services on the scale of a coin.\" Vermeule noted the resemblance of the half dollar to Roty's \"Sower\" but states that Weinman's piece \"is an original creation, not a slavish copy\". On the reverse, Vermeule admired the eagle, which dominates but does not overwhelm the design, and stated that the bird's feathers are \"a marvelous \"tour de force\"\", showing the influence of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, under whom Weinman studied. Vermeule characterized the Walking Liberty half dollar to be \"one of the greatest coins of the United States—if not of the world\".\n\nThe three sculptors met with Woolley on at the New York Assay Office to be formally told of the outcome of the competition, including the change in the outcome for the quarter, and to receive back rejected models and sketches. Polasek, who received his participation fee of $300 on , never again had any connection with the Mint or coinage design. Until a plaster model of one of his submissions was discovered at the Polasek Museum (formerly his house) in 2002, his participation was known only through the Mint's records.\n\nAfter Weinman's success in the competition, he visited the Mint to discuss the conversion of his models to finished dies. On his first visit, he found Barber absent but had a productive talk with long-time Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan. Other visits followed, and on , Woolley wrote to Superintendent Joyce \"confidentially, the sculptors designing the new coins felt that on their last trip Mr. Morgan was much more cordial and cooperative than Mr. Barber was. I realize I am dealing with artistic temperaments at both ends.\" Woolley came to New York twice in April to examine MacNeil's evolving reverse design for the quarter, on he also visited Weinman's studio and viewed progress on the models of his designs. A severe case of tonsillitis delayed Weinman's work, and caused him to request an extension of the deadline. On , Woolley wrote Weinman that the designs, both for the dime and half dollar, were accepted by the Mint.\n\nDuring June, the Mint's engraving department, headed by Barber, reduced the models to coin-sized hubs and prepared dies for experimental pattern coins, which were subsequently struck. Woolley hoped to begin production of the new coins of all three denominations by , but the grant of time to Weinman required the Mint to act with greater speed. Burdette suggests the haste with which the dies were prepared caused coins struck with them to appear worn and without sharp detail.\nBy , Weinman had viewed the first patterns, as he wrote to Woolley stating that he did not like the way the word \"Liberty\" on the obverse had turned out, and asking for the loan of two patterns so he could redo the lettering. On , Woolley wrote to Joyce, informing him of the loan and stating of the new pieces,\n\nWith Woolley's permission to redo the obverse, Weinman decided to remove the word \"Liberty\" from above the figure and place it above \"In God We Trust\" to the right of it. This permitted him to extend Liberty's head almost to the top of the coin, maximizing the size of the depiction. The letter \"L\" was placed in the concavity formed by the flag as it drapes under the figure's left elbow, and the rest of the word extended to the right from there, with the letter T in larger print, actually saving room as the larger size allowed the crossbar of the \"T\" to extend above the capitalized letters \"R\" and \"Y\". This allowed the letters to be squeezed closer together. When Woolley resigned on to become director of publicity for Woodrow Wilson's reelection campaign (a function he also fulfilled for Democratic nominees in 1912 and 1920), he mentioned in his resignation letter to Secretary McAdoo (Wilson's son-in-law), \"in working over the model for the obverse side of the half dollar Mr. Weinman is making a slight rearrangement of the word 'Liberty', and will have it ready for your inspection in a few days. I like it and believe you will.\" Weinman wrote to the former director on that increasing the size of the figure of Liberty improved its appearance.\n\nMcAdoo accepted Weinman's revised design on ; at that time Fred H. Chaffin, Adjuster of the Bureau of the Mint, was serving as Acting Mint Director until President Wilson could nominate a replacement for Woolley and have him confirmed by the Senate. Weinman decided, on his own initiative, to rearrange the legends on the reverse. On the original pattern, \"United States of America\" is at the top of the reverse, with \"Half Dollar\" directly below and \"E Pluribus Unum\" at the bottom of the coin. Weinman's revision has the legends in the places they would occupy on the circulation strikes and was approved by McAdoo on . On , Wilson nominated Woolley's successor, Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken, who was promptly confirmed by the Senate. Von Engelken was supposed to be sworn in on ; his swearing in was delayed until by President Wilson's failure to sign his commission.\n\nWhen von Engelken took office as Mint Director on , the half dollar had been approved, and pattern coins had been struck. Actual production of the 50-cent piece was delayed as the Mint struggled to finalize Weinman's Mercury dime. On , production of the dime was halted as companies testing the new 10-cent piece found that the new pieces would not work in vending machines. The defect was found to be a \"fin\", excess metal at the edge of the coin, making it seem too thick when inserted in machines. The fin could also break off, leaving the silver coins underweight. The problem was found on the pattern half dollars as well. On , von Engelken wrote to Assistant Secretary Malburn, using information that Burdette suggests came from Barber:\n\nVon Engelken's letter caused concern in the Secretary's office—McAdoo feared that if the Mint proved unable to successfully issue new coins, the Republicans might exploit the failure as an issue in the presidential race. The Secretary enquired how long it would take \"our Mr. Barber\" to produce new designs; after consultation with officials at the Philadelphia Mint, von Engelken replied that it would take six to eight months. The two officials decided that Weinman must be asked to modify his design for the half dollar—it was hoped that if Weinman shrank the figure of Liberty, and lowered the relief, the piece would prove coinable.\n\nWeinman arrived at the Mint on . He left with two pattern half dollars and instructions to reduce the size of the figure of Liberty. Barber appealed to Joyce for permission to make major changes to Weinman's design, but this was initially refused. However, when an additional change by Weinman failed to eliminate the fin problem, Joyce gave in and allowed Barber a free hand. Engraver Barber shrank the design, moving the design further from the edge, and creating a wide space between design and rim. Barber insisted that this was the only way to prevent a fin and uneven edge. A beaded border was added within the rim. According to Burdette, patterns struck from the new dies were dull and uninteresting, as the size of the figures had lent them strength.\n\nOn , Weinman wrote to Joyce, asking how the Mint was getting on with the dies for the half dollar and dime, and expressing his willingness to come to Philadelphia. Joyce replied two days later, informing him that the design of the half dollar was being reduced in size to prevent recurrence of the edge difficulties, and informing him of the beaded border. Weinman responded hoping that Joyce would prevent the figure of Liberty from being unduly reduced and rendering his account. As the sculptor and superintendent corresponded, the Mint began the work of converting the Barber-modified designs to working dies from which circulation coins could be struck, but Joyce interceded before coining could begin. The Philadelphia Mint superintendent, who had the support of von Engelken, felt that Barber's modifications were unnecessary. Joyce believed that coins closer to Weinman's concept could be struck by lowering the relief slightly, adjusting the force with which the Mint's presses struck the planchets or blanks, and better preparing the planchets for striking. Joyce's position prevailed, and Barber and his department prepared working dies for striking of circulation pieces, omitting Barber's beaded border and wide space between rim and design. Working dies were at the Denver and San Francisco Mints on , and production began at all three mints soon after.\n\nIn late December Weinman, who had received no update from the Mint since being told of the Barber modifications, but who had read in the newspapers that the half dollars were being struck, sent a $10 money order to Joyce with a request for 20 of the new coins. On , Weinman wrote to Joyce again, telling him the new pieces had been received in time to be given as New Year's gifts, and wishing the superintendent \"every good wish to you for every day of the New Year and with thanks to the Almighty and yourself that the beads are not on the border of the Half Dollar\".\n\nAlthough the dime's debut on had seen considerable publicity, the Mint had little comment on the release of the half dollar and Standing Liberty quarter the following January. There were few newspaper mentions of the new half dollar; the United States was moving towards war with Germany, and the dime release had exhausted much of the public interest in the novelty of new coins. The quarter dominated what public attention there was with an argument over whether the eagle on its reverse was portrayed accurately. Despite the minimal publicity, according to a January 1917 report from Mint Adjuster Chaffin, all three mints initially had trouble keeping up with public demand for the new half dollars.\n\n\"The New York Times\" noted on that the new pieces had been received by the Sub-Treasury and would be released two to a customer, starting on . It stated that the Mint was working as hard as possible to keep up with demand, but that initially, quantities would be limited. \"Banking\", the journal of the American Bankers Association, stated that \"The designs of the new coins have been highly praised by those having expert knowledge of such matters\". Connecticut's \"Meriden Daily Journal\" predicted readers would like the new half dollar five times as much as the new dime.\n\nThe Huntsville (Alabama) \"Mercury\", however, expressed its dislike of the new half dollar. In a piece entitled \"New half dollar is sick\", it stated:\n\nThe mint marks had initially been placed on the obverse, the first time that had been done for a regular issue US half dollar since 1839. On , von Engelken ordered that the mint mark be moved from the obverse to the reverse, stating that the obverse placement had the appearance of a die defect. At that time, Von Engelken had resigned pending appointment to the post of president of the Federal Land Bank for the Third District; once he left to take that position, he was succeeded by Raymond T. Baker. In April Joyce asked Baker for written confirmation of von Engelken's order, and after he obliged, the mint mark was duly moved. The majority of the 1917 half dollars struck at Denver (1917-D) and San Francisco (1917-S) bear the mint mark on the reverse.\n\nThroughout the time in which the Mint struck the Walking Liberty half dollar, it had difficulty bringing out the design fully. According to Breen,\n\nThe San Francisco Mint especially had difficulty with the coins; many pieces struck there are noticeably weak. In 1918 Morgan, who had succeeded Barber as Engraver after the latter's death the previous year, modified the design, incising some of the details at Liberty's neck. According to Breen \"The attempt was a failure\". Morgan's successor, John R. Sinnock, made additional attempts in 1937 and 1938, with little better results. Breen suggested that the difficulties in striking the piece contributed to the willingness to replace it after World War II.\n\nNo Walking Liberty half dollar is especially rare, but many dates are scarce in mint state condition, particularly the 1921 and 1921-D. The Mint struck proof coins in 1916–1917 and 1936–1942, all at Philadelphia. The 1916 pieces were struck in very small numbers—Breen stated that he had seen only four—and only three 1917 proof coins are confirmed, most likely struck for VIPs at a time when proof coins were not sold to the public. A number of the later proof coins lack Weinman's monogram, apparently lost through overpolishing of dies. This is most common with the 1941 proof pieces—much of the year's production lacks the monogram—but is known for other years. A total of 74,400 proof coins were struck for the series.\n\nThere are few varieties in the series, and they are relatively minor. They principally involve the mint mark: several repunchings, one overpunching of a D over an S in 1942, and some changes in letter size. One oddity is the 1943/1942, which is not a true overdate but was formed by a working die struck once from a 1942-dated master die, and once from one dated 1943. Some 1946 half dollars show a doubled die on the reverse.\n\nIn 1947, Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross asked Engraver Sinnock to produce a design for a half dollar featuring Founding Father Benjamin Franklin. Ross had long been an admirer of Franklin, and wanted to see him on a coin. Mint officials had considered putting Franklin on the dime in 1941, but the project was shelved owing to heavy demands on the Mint for coins as the United States entered World War II. During the war, the Mint contemplated adding one or more new denominations of coinage; Sinnock prepared a Franklin design in anticipation of a new issue, which did not occur. In 1946, the Treasury replaced the Mercury dime with a piece depicting the recently deceased president, Franklin Roosevelt, who had been closely associated with the March of Dimes. With the Lincoln cent popular and politically inexpedient to replace, the half dollar was the only piece being struck which was available for redesign without congressional permission. The Treasury approved the new design. Although Sinnock died before the coin was issued, the Franklin half dollar went into production at the start of 1948, ending the Walking Liberty series. A total of 485,320,340 Walking Liberty half dollars were struck.\n\nSince 1986, Weinman's obverse design has been used as the obverse design for the American Silver Eagle bullion coin. In adapting the design, Mint Sculptor-Engraver John Mercanti and other members of the engraving staff strengthened many of the details. Mercanti noted that Weinman's original plaster was only in diameter, and was softly modeled. Mercanti increased the detail so that the design, struck on a larger coin, would be bolder and would have a more even metal flow when struck than Weinman's original coin. Treasury Secretary James Baker chose a heraldic eagle design, by Mercanti, as the reverse of the American Silver Eagle.\n\nIn December 2010, President Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing bullion coins made of palladium. The obverse would be taken from the Mercury dime; the reverse would follow Weinman's architectural award medal on which he based the half dollar's reverse. The Mint was directed to obtain an independent study of whether there would be enough market demand to justify the issuance of the piece; it voided its first contract for such a study on learning that the contracted firm had ties to the palladium industry. The contract was re-awarded to New York-based CPM Group, which conducted the necessary research between May and July 2012. On , the Mint submitted a report to Congress based on the study, finding that demand would most likely not be sufficient to sustain a market in palladium bullion coins.\n\nThe United States Mint in 2015 announced plans to restrike for collectors, in gold, the three silver coins first issued in 1916. This coin has the weight and finesse of gold, thus technically making it a bullion coin. The gold version of the Walking Liberty half dollar, containing a half ounce of gold and struck at the West Point Mint, went on sale to the public on November 17, 2016. A maximum of 75,000 were minted at the West Point Mint (mint mark \"W\" appears at the same place as on regular issues of this coin).\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

It was Saddam Hussein's preferred place to meet visiting heads of state. The United States spared the palace during its shock and awe raid during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, in the belief that it might hold valuable documents. The Green Zone developed around it. The palace itself served as the MNF-I Headquarters of coalition troops during the Occupation of Iraq as well as the primary base of operations for the American diplomatic mission in Iraq until the opening of the new US Embassy in Baghdad in 2009.\n\nThe palace was officially commissioned by King Faisal II of Iraq in the 1950s as the new principal Royal residence following his planned wedding to Egyptian Princess Sabiha Fazila Khanim Sultan. The architect was J. Brian Cooper of Birmingham, renowned for his modernist designs. The architect's watercolour, drawn by Lawrence Wright, shows that the then Royal Palace was originally designed to be only the central section under the dome with two wings. The rest of the building, extending out from these three sections, was added under Saddam Hussein, including large bronze portrait heads on the roof. The fountain in front of the Royal Palace was part of the original design. The young King would never live in the palace, as he was assassinated before his wedding in the 1958 coup. The palace was thus renamed the Republican Palace.\nIn the early 1990s, Saddam sponsored a competition for original works of art for his palaces. Nahla, an Iraqi artist, architect, and member of the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra, submitted a work on paper for a mural. She won first prize in the competition and her work was realized as shown, in the north wing of the Republican Palace, in stone, by other craftsman. She was allowed no part in the development of the mural and in fact, to this day, she has not seen it in person. Her first view of the completed mural was a photograph on a website. Nahla is currently living in exile in Paris, France.\n\nNahla's title of the piece, included in Arabic across the face of the mural, is \"Baghdad My Beloved\".\n\nBefore the new denizens moved in, the Palace was completely vacant and somewhat emptied by looters as some of the heavy brass gilded doors had been taken. This building in particular wasn't the reason that 4/64 Armor (3rd Infantry Division) and 1/6 Infantry (1st Armored Division) were securing this area. This entire area was home and office to all of the key Ba'ath Party officials and most of the documents and items being sought by the coalition forces. When the coalition forces rolled into this area on April 9, 2003, most of the occupants simply fled as fast as they could, taking only what they could carry.\n\nAs early as April 2003, some of the first tenants had started to occupy office space in the Palace, such as Andrew Goledzinowski (ORHA), of the Australian Foreign Affairs Council, charged with the task of setting up the new Iraqi Ministry of Justice. However, in May 2003, the Republican Palace was still mostly vacant as, until then, no one had realized that it was uncontrolled and space was available on a first-come, first-served basis. Charlie company 3/124 infantry of the Florida Army National Guard settled among the orange groves behind the palace and successfully provided security for the palace and a large portion of the sector from April 2003 to Feb 2004.\n\nThe influx of civilians to the Palace was immediate beginning with ORHA, US Department of Defense personnel, US State Department, and their respective contractors including the civilian life-support/logistics contracting company. In about a week, the Palace filled to absolute capacity with people commandeering any and every niche they could find to work in. Because there wasn't yet any central control of the building itself there were cases where people laid claim to the broom and supply closets. Work spaces doubled as sleeping space, except when the office was already filled. It was a frequent sight when walking the hallways to see someone sleeping on the floor. Because of the heat, it became common to see men and women in various states of undress as they slept while others worked only feet away.\n\nDuring the time that the ORHA was reorganized into the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), new housing areas were assembled in the Palace grounds. People readily moved their sleeping areas out of the offices and halls and into small two-person units at the back of the Palace towards the river. When the changeover of power occurred in June 2004, the CPA went away and the US State Department assumed administrative control of what was now seen as a US asset. The palace now became the temporary US Embassy in Baghdad while the new embassy was being constructed down the road.\n\nIn addition to housing office space for the US Embassy staff, the palace also served as headquarters for the Army's Program Management Office (PMO), later Project and Contracting Office (PCO), while the PCO's off-site location was under construction. This lasted for quite some time as there were problems getting their own compound built. For this reason, the relatively new annex on the south wing of the Palace was dubbed the \"PCO Annex.\" This was the same annex that a rocket struck on the night before the first elections in January 2005. The rocket fatally wounded two PCO members even though it did not explode. The PCO moved to their own compound elsewhere in the Green Zone in October 2005.\n\nUp until mid-2005, there were many organizations using the Palace for office space but it was not for reasons of centralization at all - far from it. The place was crammed with people and information flow was inefficient at best. The main reason is that it was the only large hard-structure building that provided better protection from incoming mortars and at the same time was on a compound that is relatively easy to secure at a respectable distance from the building itself.\n\nUntil July 2005, there was a central dining facility inside one of the ballrooms. This caused many problems as the Palace was not designed for the foot-traffic flows in excess of 10,000 people a day. There was rarely a meal served where the central-south wing of the first floor was not crammed with people, as this was the only dining facility (DFAC) that the coalition forces had set up for a long time. This was not a ballroom; it was the Republican Congress meeting room. It had a round table encompassing the entire room. This was removed and converted into a mess hall in the fall of 2003.\n\nBehind the Palace is a semi-kidney-shaped swimming pool with a multi-level diving platform and a stone cabana/pool house on the side.\n\nWhile still a highly secured area, most of the organizations have long since found other, less cramped, working conditions on other locations in the International Zone (Green Zone). In the past, there were days of jockeying through one particularly notorious doorway in the middle of the long corridor called \"Choke-Point Charlie\".\n"}
{"id": "2229884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229884", "title": "Serratus anterior muscle", "text": "Serratus anterior muscle\n\nThe serratus anterior is a muscle that originates on the surface of the 1st to 8th ribs at the side of the chest and inserts along the entire anterior length of the medial border of the scapula. The serratus anterior acts to pull the scapula forward around the thorax. The muscle is named from Latin: \"serrare\" = to saw, referring to the shape, \"anterior\" = on the front side of the body.\n\nSerratus anterior normally originates by nine or ten slips (muscle branches) from either the first to ninth ribs or the first to eighth ribs. Because two slips usually arise from the second rib, the number of slips is greater than the number of ribs from which they originate.\n\nThe muscle is inserted along the medial border of the scapula between the superior and inferior angles along with being inserted along the thoracic vertebrae. The muscle is divided into three named parts depending on their points of insertions:\n\nThe serratus anterior lies deep to the subscapularis, from which it is separated by the subscapularis (supraserratus) bursa. It is separated from the rib by the scapulothoracic (infraserratus) bursa.\n\nThe serratus anterior is innervated by the long thoracic nerve (Nerve of Bell), a branch of the brachial plexus. The long thoracic nerve travels inferiorly on the surface of the serratus. The nerve is especially vulnerable during certain types of surgery (for example, during lymph node clearance from the axilla (e.g., in case of axillary dissection in a surgery for breast cancer)). Damage to this nerve is the most common cause of winged scapula.\n\nAll three parts described above pull the scapula forward around the thorax, which is essential for anteversion of the arm. As such, the muscle is an antagonist to the rhomboids. However, when the inferior and superior parts act together, they keep the scapula pressed against the thorax \"together\" with the rhomboids and therefore these parts also act as synergists to the rhomboids. The inferior part can pull the lower end of the scapula laterally and forward and thus rotates the scapula to make elevation of the arm possible. Additionally, all three parts can lift the ribs when the shoulder girdle is fixed, and thus assist in respiration.\n\nThe serratus anterior is occasionally called the \"big swing muscle\" or \"boxer's muscle\" because it is largely responsible for the protraction of the scapula — that is, the pulling of the scapula forward and around the rib cage that occurs when someone throws a punch.\n\nThe serratus anterior also plays an important role in the upward rotation of the scapula, such as when lifting a weight overhead. It performs this in sync with the upper and lower fibers of the trapezius.\n\nThe muscles of the shoulder can be categorized into three topographic units: the scapulohumeral, axiohumeral, and axioscapular groups. Serratus anterior forms part of the latter group together with rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, levator scapulae, and trapezius. The trapezius evolved separately, but the other three muscles in this group evolved from the first eight or ten ribs and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (homologous to the ribs).\n\nFunctional demands have resulted in the evolution of individual muscles from the basal unit formed by the serratus anterior. In primitive life forms, the main function of the axioscapular group is to control the movements of the vertebral border of the scapula: fibers concerned with the dorsal movement of scapula evolved into the rhomboids, those with ventral motion into serratus anterior, and those with cranial movements into levator scapulae. The evolution of the serratus anterior itself has resulted in (1) grouping of its distal and proximal fibers, (2) size reduction of its intermediate fibers, and (3) the insertion of its dominant superior and inferior parts onto the superior and inferior angles of the scapula.\n\nIn primates, the thoracic cage is wide and the scapula is rotated onto its posterior side to have the glenoid cavity face laterally. Additionally, the clavicle takes care of medial forces. In cursorial mammals (for example the horse and other quadrupeds), the scapula is hanging vertically on the side of the thorax and the clavicle is absent. Therefore, in climbing animals, the serratus anterior supports the scapula against the reaction forces of the free limb and exerts high bending forces on the ribs. To sustain these forces, the ribs have a pronounced curvature and are supported by the clavicle. In cursorial animals, the thorax is hanging between the scapulae at the serratus anterior and pectoralis muscles.\n\n\n\n"}

It was erected in 1902-06 for financier, philanthropist, and sportsman Payne Whitney and his wife Helen, a poet and patron of the arts. Whitney had been given the land by his uncle Oliver Payne, who was an officer in the Civil War and the benefactor instrumental in establishing the Cornell University Medical College. Commissioned in 1902 by Payne Whitney's uncle Colonel Oliver Hazard Payne as a wedding gift for his nephew and his bride, Helen Hay, the Colonel had put up $625,000 to build the five-storey mansion, the construction of which was still under White's supervision when he was murdered in 1906.\n\nStanford White designed and oversaw the construction of the exterior and interiors of the house. \n\nWhite purchased a marble statue sculpted by Michelangelo c. 1490 and installed it on a fountain at the Fifth Avenue mansion of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney.

{"id": "2229899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229899", "title": "Content validity", "text": "Content validity\n\nIn psychometrics, content validity (also known as logical validity) refers to the extent to which a measure represents all facets of a given construct. For example, a depression scale may lack content validity if it only assesses the affective dimension of depression but fails to take into account the behavioral dimension. An element of subjectivity exists in relation to determining content validity, which requires a degree of agreement about what a particular personality trait such as extraversion represents. A disagreement about a personality trait will prevent the gain of a high content validity.\n\nContent validity is different from face validity, which refers not to what the test actually measures, but to what it superficially appears to measure. Face validity assesses whether the test \"looks valid\" to the examinees who take it, the administrative personnel who decide on its use, and other technically untrained observers. Content validity requires the use of recognized subject matter experts to evaluate whether test items assess defined content and more rigorous statistical tests than does the assessment of face validity. Content validity is most often addressed in academic and vocational testing, where test items need to reflect the knowledge actually required for a given topic area (e.g., history) or job skill (e.g., accounting). In clinical settings, content validity refers to the correspondence between test items and the symptom content of a syndrome.\n\nOne widely used method of measuring content validity was developed by C. H. Lawshe. It is essentially a method for gauging agreement among raters or judges regarding how essential a particular item is. Lawshe (1975) proposed that each of the subject matter expert raters (SMEs) on the judging panel respond to the following question for each item: \"Is the skill or knowledge measured by this item 'essential,' 'useful, but not essential,' or 'not necessary' to the performance of the construct?\" According to Lawshe, if more than half the panelists indicate that an item is essential, that item has at least some content validity. Greater levels of content validity exist as larger numbers of panelists agree that a particular item is essential. Using these assumptions, Lawshe developed a formula termed the content validity ratio:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 content validity ratio, formula_3 number of SME panelists indicating \"essential\", formula_4 total number of SME panelists. This formula yields values which range from +1 to -1; positive values indicate that at least half the SMEs rated the item as essential. The mean CVR across items may be used as an indicator of overall test content validity.\n\nLawshe (1975) provided a table of critical values for the CVR by which a test evaluator could determine, for a pool of SMEs of a given size, the size of a calculated CVR necessary to exceed chance expectation. This table had been calculated for Lawshe by his friend, Lowell Schipper. Close examination of this published table revealed an anomaly. In Schipper's table, the critical value for the CVR increases monotonically from the case of 40 SMEs (minimum value = .29) to the case of 9 SMEs (minimum value = .78) only to unexpectedly drop at the case of 8 SMEs (minimum value = .75) before hitting its ceiling value at the case of 7 SMEs (minimum value = .99). However, it is important to understand when applying the formula to 8 raters, the result from 7 Essential and 1 other rating yields a CVR of .75. If .75 was not the critical value, then you would need 8 of 8 raters of Essential that would yield a CVR of 1.00. In that case, to be consistent with the ascending order of CVRs the value for 8 raters would have to be 1.00. That would violate the same principle because you would have the \"perfect\" value required for 8 raters, but not for ratings at other numbers of raters at either higher or lower than 8 raters. Whether this departure from the table's otherwise monotonic progression was due to a calculation error on Schipper's part or an error in typing or type setting is unclear. Wilson, Pan, and Schumsky (2012), seeking to correct the error, found no explanation in Lawshe's writings nor any publications by Schipper describing how the table of critical values was computed. Wilson and colleagues determined that the Schipper values were close approximations to the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. By comparing Schipper's values to the newly calculated binomial values, they also found that Lawshe and Schipper had erroneously labeled their published table as representing a one-tailed test when in fact the values mirrored the binomial values for a two-tailed test. Wilson and colleagues published a recalculation of critical values for the content validity ratio providing critical values in unit steps at multiple alpha levels.\n\nThe table of values is the following one:\n\nN° of panelists Min.

It is the sole species in the monotypic genus \"Lamprocapnos\", but is still widely referenced under its old name Dicentra spectabilis (now listed as a synonym). It is valued in gardens and in floristry for its heart-shaped pink and white flowers, borne in spring.\n\nOther common names include lyre flower, heart flower and lady-in-a-bath.\n\nThe Asian bleeding-heart grows to 120 cm (47 in) tall by 45 cm (18 in) wide. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial with 3-lobed compound leaves on fleshy green to pink stems. The arching horizontal racemes of up to 20 pendent flowers are borne in spring and early summer. The outer petals are bright fuchsia-pink, while the inner ones are white. The flowers strikingly resemble the conventional heart shape, with a droplet beneath – hence the common name. \n\nThe plant sometimes behaves as a spring ephemeral, going dormant in summer.\n\nThe first specimens were introduced to England from Asia in the 1840s by the Scottish botanist and plant hunter Robert Fortune.\n\nIn a moist and cool climate, it will grow in full sun, but in warmer and drier climates it requires some shade.\n\nAphids, slugs and snails sometimes feed on the leaves.\n\nClumps remain compact for many years and do not need dividing. They have brittle roots which are easily damaged when disturbed. Root cuttings should be taken in spring.\n\nSeeds with whitish elaiosomes are borne in long pods. They must be sown while fresh. Division should be done in the late fall (autumn) or early spring.\n\nSeveral cultivars have been selected. 'Alba' has white flowers, and 'Gold Heart', introduced from Hadspen Garden, England, in 1997, has yellow leaves.\n\nThe species, the cultivar 'Alba' and the red-and-white cultivar 'Valentine' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nContact with the plant can cause skin irritation in some people from isoquinoline-like alkaloids.\n"}

He worked in many styles, but most often in a simplified neo-Romanesque, and designed important public buildings both in the Weimar Republic and under the Third Reich, including major bridges for the new autobahns. In 1943 he designed several buildings in Turkey, returning to Stuttgart in 1954.\n\nBonatz was born in Solgne, Alsace-Lorraine, then German Empire. In 1900, he finished his studies of architecture at the Technical University of Munich. He trained under Theodor Fischer, but unlike Fischer, did not join the Nazi party, and had actually briefly belonged to the SPD. After building several major buildings during the Weimar Republic, notably the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (main station, 1913–1927), after the Nazis came to power he became architectural expert and advisor to Fritz Todt, the general inspector for German road building, and in this position built major bridges for the new Reichsautobahn system and with Hermann Giesler worked on the design for a planned new main station for Munich.\n\nThe government tried to make good use of Bonatz's talents and name, but found him politically unreliable. He disliked Paul Troost's renovation of the Königsplatz in Munich and said so, a political mistake. In February 1935 he gave a speech inveighing against architecture which made \"the act of representing an end in itself\" rather than form coinciding with function in which he called Albert Speer's New Reich Chancellery \"patently inadequate\". Because of his vocal opinions, Bonatz was investigated twice by the police, who accused him of aiding Jews and being openly critical of Hitler.\n\nAlthough he won the competition to execute the gigantic glass dome for the new main station in Munich, he soon became disenchanted with Hitler's requiring the dome and critical of the entire design. This led him to leave Germany for Turkey in 1943. He was a faculty member at the Istanbul Technical University from 1946 to 1954 and oversaw renovation of the university's Taşkışla campus. While in Turkey he built many projects in Ankara, including a residential area with over 400 units and the reconfiguration of the Ankara Exhibition Hall into the Ankara Opera House, before returning to Germany in 1954 to participate in the reconstruction of Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. He was a professor at the University of Stuttgart from 1954 until his death in 1956.\n\nIn 1902 he married Helene Fröhlich (1879 – 1965); their daughter Susanne, born in 1906, married the architect Kurt Dübbers. His younger brother, Karl Bonatz, was also an architect and was chief planner of (West) Berlin succeeding Hans Scharoun.\n\nBonatz believed passionately in form expressing function, but opposed the modernist tradition exemplified by \"Neues Bauen\" and the Bauhaus, which he considered shallow, fashionable, and neglectful of local traditions. He was a founder and an important exponent of the Stuttgart School, which sought modern architectural solutions based on tradition. He thus worked in a number of styles depending on purpose, although he was influenced by Fischer's movement toward a simplified masonry-based style based on German heritage and often used a simplified neo-Romanesque vocabulary, as in his 1927 Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, his 1936 Kunstmuseum Basel (art museum), and the viaducts at the Drackensteiner Hang. The Stuttgart station, which was influential, has been seen as a transformation of historicism: the building itself was modern, the historical decor purely stylistic accents. Like Fischer, Heinrich Tessenow and German Bestelmeyer, he appealed to the Nazis because many of his works bore a clear relationship to traditional styles; Paul Schultze-Naumburg expressed the völkisch school's approval of the Stuttgart station as \"a modern technical building in the best sense of the word.\" However, his autobahn bridge across the Rhine at Rodenkirchen (1939–1941) was an ultra-modern suspension bridge, he designed a number of dams and factories in addition to bridges, and at Kornwestheim he coupled a reinforced concrete water tower with offices on the lower floor with a hipped-roof town hall.\n\nBonatz's most famous building in Stuttgart is the Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof (main station), built 1913–1927. On 25 November 2009 the station complex was nominated by UNESCO for possible inclusion in their World Cultural Heritage list.\n\nBonatz also designed the library building of the University of Tübingen (built 1910–1912) and was involved in the final stages of the architectural design of the Sofia University Faculty of Biology building in Sofia, Bulgaria. The brick edifice was constructed in 1924-30 and was mostly designed by the Bulgarian architect Georgi Ovcharov, who worked the project out at Bonatz's office in Stuttgart.\n\nAmong his technical buildings, he built bridges from the start of his career, beginning at Ulm in 1907 and including a slender bridge over the Neckar at Heidelberg in 1927. For the autobahns, he oversaw all bridge design and himself designed many of the innumerable small bridges required. In the 1920s he was responsible for ten dams on the Neckar; he used different construction materials to reflect the local geology.\n\nIn 1952, he was awarded the Pour le Mérite for Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 1958/59, the city of Stuttgart instituted the Paul Bonatz Prize for architectural services in his memory.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2229944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2229944", "title": "Pound–Rebka experiment", "text": "Pound–Rebka experiment\n\nThe Pound–Rebka experiment was an experiment in which gamma rays were emitted from the top of a tower and measured by a receiver at the bottom of the tower. The purpose of the experiment was to test Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity by showing that photons gain energy when traveling toward a gravitational source (the Earth). It was proposed by Robert Pound and his graduate student Glen A. Rebka Jr. in 1959, and was the last of the classical tests of general relativity to be verified (in the same year). It is a gravitational redshift experiment, which measures the change of frequency of light moving in a gravitational field. In this experiment, the frequency shift was a blueshift toward a higher frequency. Equivalently, the test demonstrated the general relativity prediction that clocks should run at different rates in different places of a gravitational field. It is considered to be the experiment that ushered in an era of precision tests of general relativity.\n\nConsider an electron bound to an atom in an excited state. As the electron undergoes a transition from the excited state to a lower energy state it will emit a photon with a frequency corresponding to the difference in energy between the excited state and the lower energy state. The reverse process will also occur: if the electron is in the lower energy state then it can undergo a transition to the excited state by absorbing a photon at the resonant frequency for this transition. In practice the photon frequency is not required to be at exactly the resonant frequency, but must be in a narrow range of frequencies centred on the resonant frequency: a photon with a frequency outside this region cannot excite the electron to a higher energy state.\n\nNow consider two copies of this electron-atom system, one in the excited state (the emitter), the other in the lower energy state (the receiver). If the two systems are stationary relative to one another and the space between them is flat (i.e. we neglect gravitational fields) then the photon emitted by the emitter can be absorbed by the electron in the receiver. However, if the two systems are in a gravitational field then the photon may undergo gravitational redshift as it travels from the first system to the second, causing the photon frequency observed by the receiver to be different to the frequency observed by the emitter when it was originally emitted. Another possible source of redshift is the Doppler effect: if the two systems are not stationary relative to one another then the photon frequency will be modified by the relative speed between them.\n\nIn the Pound–Rebka experiment, the emitter was placed at the top of a tower with the receiver at the bottom. General relativity predicts that the gravitational field of the Earth will cause a photon emitted downwards (towards the Earth) to be blueshifted (i.e. its frequency will increase) according to the formula:\n\nwhere \"formula_2\" (\"formula_3\") is the frequency of the receiver (emitter), \"h\" is the distance between the receiver and emitter, \"M\" is the Earth's mass, \"R\" is the radius of the Earth, \"G\" is Newton's constant and \"c\" is the speed of light. To counteract the effect of gravitational blueshift, the emitter was moved upwards (away from the receiver) causing the photon frequency to be redshifted, according to the Doppler shift formula:\n\nwhere \"v\" is the relative speed between the emitter and receiver. Pound and Rebka varied the relative speed \"v\" so that the Doppler redshift exactly cancelled the gravitational blueshift:\n\nIn the case of the Pound–Rebka experiment formula_6. Therefore:\n\nIn the more general case when \"h\" ≈ \"R\" the above is no longer true.\nThe energy associated with gravitational redshift over a distance of 22.5 meters is very small. The fractional change in energy is given by\nδ\"E\"/\"E\", is equal to \"gh\"/\"c\" = 2.5×10. Therefore, short wavelength high energy photons are required to detect such minute differences. The 14 keV gamma rays emitted by iron-57 when it transitions to its base state proved to be sufficient for this experiment.\n\nNormally, when an atom emits or absorbs a photon, it also moves (recoils) a little, which takes away some energy from the photon due to the principle of conservation of momentum.\n\nThe Doppler shift required to compensate for this recoil effect would be much larger (about 5 orders of magnitude) than the Doppler shift required to offset the gravitational redshift. But in 1958 Rudolf Mössbauer reported that all atoms in a solid lattice absorb the recoil energy when a single atom in the lattice emits a gamma ray. Therefore, the emitting atom will move very little (just as a cannon will not produce a large recoil when it is braced, e.g. with sandbags). This allowed Pound and Rebka to set up their experiment as a variation of Mössbauer spectroscopy.\n\nThe test was carried out at Harvard University's Jefferson laboratory. A solid sample containing iron (Fe) emitting gamma rays was placed in the center of a loudspeaker cone which was placed near the roof of the building. Another sample containing Fe was placed in the basement. The distance between this source and absorber was 22.5 meters (73.8 ft). The gamma rays traveled through a Mylar bag filled with helium to minimize scattering of the gamma rays. A scintillation counter was placed below the receiving Fe sample to detect the gamma rays that were not absorbed by the receiving sample. By vibrating the speaker cone the gamma ray source moved with varying speed, thus creating varying Doppler shifts. When the Doppler shift canceled out the gravitational blueshift, the receiving sample absorbed gamma rays and the number of gamma rays detected by the scintillation counter dropped accordingly. The variation in absorption could be correlated with the phase of the speaker vibration, hence with the speed of the emitting sample and therefore the Doppler shift. To compensate for possible systematic errors, Pound and Rebka varied the speaker frequency between 10 Hz and 50 Hz, interchanged the source and absorber-detector, and used different speakers (ferroelectric and moving coil magnetic transducer). The reason for exchanging the positions of the absorber and the detector is doubling the effect. Pound subtracted two experimental results:\n\n\nThe frequency shift for the two cases has the same magnitude but opposing signs. When subtracting the results, Pound and Rebka obtained a result twice as big as for the one-way experiment.\n\nThe result confirmed that the predictions of general relativity were borne out at the 10% level. This was later improved to better than the 1% level by Pound and Snider.\n\nAnother test, Gravity Probe A, involving a space-borne hydrogen maser increased the accuracy of the measurement to about (0.01%).\n\n"}

Set in the future, a giant fighting machine called the Aquarion is humanity's only effective weapon in the fight against the technologically advanced species called the Shadow Angels.\n\n\"Aquarion\" aired from April 4, 2005, to September 26, 2005, on TV Tokyo. An alternate retelling of the television series, the \"Genesis of Aquarion\" OVA, premiered on May 25, 2007. The television series is licensed in North America by Funimation. On February 14, 2006, it aired on MTV Italia.\n\nOn April 27, 2009, the series made its North American television debut on the Funimation Channel.\n\nA sequel to the series titled was announced on February 25, 2011, and aired in 2012.\n\nTwelve thousand years in the past, mankind was at mercy of the mythical creatures known as , immortal winged beings with overwhelming powers and technology. That is, until one of their kind, Apollonius, fell in love with a female human warrior, Seliane. Apollonius joins forces with the humans to free mankind from oppression, by using the legendary giant fighting robot .\n\nEleven years prior to the story, in a disaster referred to as the \"Great Catastrophe\" Earth's magnetic field shifted devastating significant parts of the world and killing off many of its inhabitants. Along with the disaster came the return of the Shadow Angels who had been in slumber in their city of since their battle with Apolonius. The Shadow Angels began invading human cites to harvest human beings, dubbing them \"the wingless ones,\" like cattle, to extract from the captured humans. Their prana serves as energy and nutrition not only to the Shadow Angels, but also to the legendary . The Shadow Angels facilitate their harvesting via giant, floating harvesting machines called which are guarded by giant mecha called . They are sentient machines, yet there are times when they are piloted by Shadow Angels.\n\nOrdinary weapons prove ineffective against the Cherubim, and rings of projectors around the remaining cities, tapping into Earth's strata to project a quantum shield to keep Shadow Angels from entering or materializing in them, provide only limited protection. However a human expedition under the leadership of Gen Fudo excavates three very technologically advanced fighter planes, and an organization called takes over the research of these planes, called , trying to identify how to use them. The three Vectors, colored mostly in white, are identified as the green , the blue , and the red . DEAVA discovers only people with special powers, called , can use the Vectors and the three Vectors are in fact the pieces of Aquarion, the same robot used to fight the Shadow Angels twelve millennia before. They also discover the Elements can ultimately unite the Vectors into one of three formations of the giant robot in battle, and can use it to fight and defeat the Cherubim.\n\nDuring the Elements' first sortie against the Cherubim by uniting the Vectors into a formation of Aquarion, they stumble on 13-year-old Apollo, who seems to be the reincarnation of Apollonius. They become convinced of this when he single-handedly takes control of the Vector Sol, unites the Vectors into the Solar Aquarion formation and defeats the enemy, thus causing him to be recruited by DEAVA to join their ranks.\n\nAge of Aquarius, also known as the Aquarian Age, was a concept popularized by Carl Gustav Jung. The Age of Aquarius was seen in contraposition with current the Age of Pisces: whereas the Age of Pisces represents duality and antithesis (thus, conflict), the Age of Aquarius is an age of synthesis and spiritualism (in some ways, a new golden age). In the New Age, because of the implications of love, comprehension and one-ness, it can be associated with the fourth chakra. Aquarion as a name is a reference to this concept, but the show digs deeper in symbolism in using the Aquarion as an instrument for a \"new era of holy genesis,\" managing to resolve conflict between the opposing parties of humans and Shadow Angels and showing a not-so-metaphorical process of oneness with the Earth.\n\nAquarion's main theme references Indian lore. The word yoga is translated as \"unite\" and means \"union with the divine through the integration of body, mind and spirit\" (in Japanese, the word \"kokoro\" refers to both heart or mind, but is more often translated as just the heart). During Unification, the Elements merge their bodies, minds and spirits, but a real Unification of the Aquarion can only be obtained with a Shadow Angel on board, fitting the scheme of the divine element necessary into order to achieve true Unification and completing Aquarion's power.\n\nYogis are said to develop special powers called siddhis. One of them is called prapti (acquisition) and with this siddhi, the perfect mystic yogi can not only touch the moon, but he can extend his hand anywhere and take whatever he likes. In the series, the Solar Aquarion's Infinity Punch manages to reach the moon, although the real prapti should not involve greatly elongated arms, but rather the ability to cancel distances between objects (resulting in the idea of omnipresence). In this sense, the real prapti in the show is perhaps used by Gen Fudo, who makes things appear out of nothing from his hand. It is worth noting another siddhi called Mahima is the ability to become incredibly big; this may be referenced to the Aquarion's ability to expand itself in size during particular battles with the Cherubim.\n\nThe character Apollonius is a passing nod to Greek mythology, seemingly inspired by Apollo, the Greek god of light and Prometheus, who gave fire to humans and was punished by Zeus by having an eagle feast on his liver. Similarly, Apollonius is a Shadow Angel who seems to have light-like powers and gives the humans a fighting chance against the Shadow Angels with the Aquarion, but loses his wings as punishment from the other Shadow Angels. Like Apollonius of Tyana, Aquarion's Apollonius dies and is believed to be reincarnated as the protagonist Apollo, while the Greek god Apollo is stated to have been born in the bank of a lake, Aquarion's Apollo is given his name after he swims in a lake.\n\nAtlandia's Tree of Life took on two roles throughout the series. It is basically a large pile of multicolored flowers. The arrangement of the flowers at the end of the top central flowering portion can be easily seen forming the ten interconnecting nodes of the Sephirot from Hebrew Bible/Christianity, only that the flower at the top middle center of this arrangement, the spot that is supposed to symbolize the unity of the nodes, is absent. The tree's first role was made by the Shadow Angels to use it to restart the Shadow Angel race. The second role was its original role and was a similar function to its name, it literally contained the entire planet's life force. Because of this, if that force was unleashed as a power such as to give birth to a race of species, the planet would become lifeless and the tree would die, causing its remains to fall to the Earth's core and make the planet fall apart.

They were influential in the Southern California hardcore scene during the mid-to-late 1990s. The band chose the name Unbroken because they wanted to emphasize their dedication to the straight edge philosophy of drug abstinence. However, most of the members have since given up this belief.\n\nIn 2008, \"Alternative Press\" named Unbroken a band of significant interest in its cover story \"23 Bands Who Shaped Punk\", citing them as an influence on later groups such as The Hope Conspiracy, Throwdown, Suicide File, Planes Mistaken for Stars, Modern Life Is War, and Bleeding Through.\n\nThe band's members were also in the groups Struggle, Swing Kids, Kill Holiday, Julia, Some Girls, Smooth Man Automatic, Johnny Angel, Stabbed By Words, and Over My Dead Body before, during, and after Unbroken's existence.\n\nGuitarist Eric Allen committed suicide 3 years after the breakup of the band. The band reformed soon after Eric's death for 1 show as a benefit to Eric's family.\n\nRob Moran until recently played in the hardcore group Some Girls and now resides back in San Diego. He has more recently started a band with John Pettibone (former member of Undertow, Nineironspitfire and Himsa), Ryan Murphy (former member of Undertow, Ten Yard Fight, Ensign) and Aram Arslanian (guitarist of Champion, The First Step and vocalist for Betrayed). The band, The Vows, is a straight-edge band that is musically influenced by the old-school hardcore band Judge. The Vows released a CD on Indecision Records in 2006. Rob Moran is in a new band called Narrows with Dave Verellen of Botch and Ryan Frederiksen of These Arms Are Snakes. They have released a S/T 7\", an album called New Distances, as well a split 7\" with Seattle band Heiress. All releases are on Deathwish Inc.\nHe is also working on other musical projects with friends in San Diego. One of which is a goth band with Gabe Serbian from The Locust.\n\nDave Claibourne sings for the band Stabbed By Words (who have a full length out on Hawthorne Street Records), and is a drum & bass dj with Dedication Crew in St. Louis, MO. He is trying to get Round 2 back together for a European reunion tour in 2011.\n\nSteven Andrew Miller moved away from San Diego and now resides in Orange County. He now plays in Crushed On You who are set to release an EP later in 2008 on an unnamed label.\n\nTodd Beattie now lives in Los Angeles, and is married to acclaimed furniture designer Tanya Aguiniga.\n\nDespite talk that these would be their only reunion shows, as of 2010, Unbroken are also scheduled to play the annual FYF Fest (formerly F Yeah Fest and Fuck Yeah Fest) in Los Angeles, California on September 4, and at ULU in London, England on October 16.\n\nUnbroken played a reunion show in New York City at Santos Party House on April 10, 2011 with Indecision, Jesuit, Damnation A.D., Unrestrained and Psychic Limb.\n\nIn September 2011 they toured Argentina, Chile, and other Latin American countries.\n\nUnbroken also scheduled to play Mexico for the first time in 2012 as well as a small tour of Europe.\n\nUnbroken decided to play shows in various regions around the world after their shows in the states sold out and left fans from outside the US without a chance to see them.\nThrough their reunion shows, the band has raised over $30,000 for various charities and causes all over the world.\n\nUnbroken played on 11/02/2014 at the Ukrainian Cultural Center in Los Angeles for the 20 year mark of \"Life.Love.Regret.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Defeated in a duel of magic by the prophet Moses, the magician is exiled into the desert for his failure. The title \"Nova\" recounts in flashback how Anath-Na discovers the alien Ka Stone, which grants him immortality and a host of other powers. Using the alias the Sphinx, Anath-Na wanders the Earth for thousands of years, and eventually becomes bored with his immortality. After learning the origins of the hero Nova, a human empowered by the aliens of the planet Xandar and possessing the subconscious knowledge of Xandar's Living Computer, the Sphinx theorized that the machine may be able to find a way to end his immortal life.\n\nIn a \"Fantastic Four\" annual, the Sphinx empowers a pawn called Thraxon to help subdue the Inhumans, as he plans to use the power of ruler Black Bolt to amplify a scanning device and read the minds of all mankind for knowledge of how to finally die. Superhero team the Fantastic Four defeat Thraxon and, in a final confrontation, Black Bolt blasts the Sphinx into deep space. The character reappears in the title \"Nova\", taking mental control of Nova and with his temporary allies (Comet, Crimebuster, Diamondhead, Powerhouse, and Doctor Sun), they travel back to Xandar to join a war against the invading Skrulls.\n\nThe story continues in the title \"Fantastic Four\", where this proves to be a ruse as, once on Xandar, the Sphinx takes advantage of the war to find and absorb the knowledge of the Living Computer of Xandar. Evolving into a god, the Sphinx decides to destroy Earth. The Fantastic Four witness this and, knowing that they are outmatched, Mister Fantastic contacts the cosmic entity Galactus and presents a proposal — if Galactus will defeat the Sphinx, then Mister Fantastic will release him from his vow to never threaten the Earth again. Galactus accepts, and after the Fantastic Four find Galactus a new Herald (Terrax), the group travel to Earth. Galactus defeats the Sphinx, and after crushing his Ka Stone sends him back in human form to ancient Egypt. The character is trapped in a time loop, forcing Anath-Na to constantly relive his life to this point.\n\nAn issue of the title \"Marvel Two-In-One\" continues the story, as Anath-Na relives his life several times until due to a chronal flaw he is able to meet himself, and so warns the younger Anath-Na as to his future. The two then build a machine to reconstruct the Ka Stone, and after hypnotizing the younger version of Anath-Na so he would not remember, the future version enters suspended animation. The future version of the Sphinx awakens after Galactus departs, and begins to rebuild the Ka Stone. The hero the Thing, however, battles the Sphinx to a standstill and destroys the machine, leaving the Sphinx with an incomplete Stone. The Sphinx departs, but on learning that the incomplete Ka Stone is losing all power seeks revenge of the Thing. The villain Puppet Master assists the Thing and forces the Sphinx to crush the Ka Stone; as a result Anath-Na immediately ages five thousand years and crumbles to dust.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event, Sphinx obtained Nadeen Hassan's brother Navid as an apprentice where he helped Sphinx retrieve numerous Egyptian artifacts from the San Francisco Museum of Egyptian Culture.\n\nMeryet Karim is a desert nomad who finds an unconscious Anath-Na Mut soon after he finds the Ka Stone. In nursing him back to health, Karim absorbs residual energies from the Ka Stone which grant her a fraction of its power. Karim found that after death she was being perpetually reincarnated into new bodies and retains the knowledge of her previous lives with each rebirth. In the modern era, Karim finds the remnants of the Ka Stone and reconstructs it to become the new Sphinx. Karim then alters history so that Anath-Na Mut kills Moses which leads to Egypt eventually conquering the world and leading to the \"Forever Yesterday\" storyline. Karim is thwarted by the superhero team the New Warriors and she resurrects Anath-Na in a bid to reclaim his love. The newly empowered Anath-Na battles the New Warriors. But when forced to face his feelings for Karim, he decides to merge with her into a composite entity which goes back in time to live a normal life.\n\nThe gestalt entity has a final appearance in the title the \"New Warriors\" before reappearing as the male Sphinx in the third volume of the title \"Nova\". The character discovers that Galactus' curse is still in effect and battles Nova once again, intent on having access to Xandarian knowledge. The Sphinx appears in an issue of the fourth volume of the title \"Nova\".\n\nThe Sphinx is an ancient mutant, who has gained additional abilities through use of the Ka Stone, and other sources. The character possesses superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes, and virtual immortality. Courtesy of the Ka stone, the Sphinx also possess a range of metaphysical abilities including energy projection; telepathy; teleportation and flight. The Sphinx also possesses knowledge of ancient Egyptian sorcery.\n\n"}

Such policies are often mandated to be described in detail in specific sections of a company's annual or quarterly reports. Adopting specific accounting policies and procedures (such as Sarbanes Oxley) is one method organization's use to ensure adequate controls and transparency in financial reporting, to minimize the risk of fraud.\n\nMany accounting policies necessarily involve the subjective valuation of different items in order to give observers the best possible \"snapshot\" of a company's finances by looking at a single balance sheet or profit and loss statement. For example, a bank that has just made a lot of new loans would look good on one report, but if many of those borrowers later failed to repay then a subsequent report would look very bad. So generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) would require the bank management (and not the accountants) to estimate how many borrowers would fail to repay, and to include those losses alongside the new loans. While there are many situations common to almost all companies where management must make subjective accounting entries, \"critical accounting policies\" are often those particular to an industry or company, and are judged to be even more subjective then normal.\n\nOne of the key reasons many investors and analysts pay attention to critical accounting policies is that their subjective nature is believed to be riper for abuse through creative accounting, especially \"slush fund accounting\". In slush fund accounting, excess earnings from a good quarter or year are hidden by changing the subjective element of a critical accounting policy. The \"hidden funds\" can then be put back into the reported profit in a bad quarter. Companies do this because of a general belief that the ideal company is one that is always consistently and smoothly increasing earnings. For example, a clothing store does not show the profit on all the sales it made in the current quarter because it knows that some of those clothes will be returned later and it will have to give back the money. To smooth earnings, in a good quarter managers can say that they believe that the amount of returns will be high. Then when they have a bad quarter, they can say that they had overestimated the value of returns and add the surplus back into that quarter's profit.\n\nSome examples of critical accounting policies are:\n\n\nUS Securities and Exchange Commission statement: \n"}

As he grew up, Carlo Mollino became interested in a variety of topics that were as outrageous as his art, such as design, architecture, the occult, and race cars.\n\nHe was once credited as saying, \"Everything is permissible as long as it is fantastic.\" That credo was certainly reflected throughout his body of work. Mollino's architecture and furniture are famous for their ability to enable occupants to manipulate volumes at a whim.\n\nCarlo Mollino died in 1973, while still working.\n\nIn 1930, Carlo Mollino started his career as an architect designing a house in Forte dei Marmi and receiving the G. Pistono prize for architecture. Between 1933 and 1948, he worked in his father's office, and took part in several architecture competitions (e.g. the Farmers Association Building in Cuneo, the Fascist House in Voghera, and, after World War II, the Monument to the Partisan, which was created in collaboration with the sculptor Umberto Mastroianni. The Monument to the Partisan was placed in the Generale cemetery of Turin after winning the competition.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1939, Mollino designs, in collaboration with Vittorio Baudi di Selve, the Società Ippica Torinese building in Turin, considered his masterpiece. However, this building was destroyed in 1960. This work breaks with the past and the regime, refusing the rationalist school and taking inspiration from Alvar Aalto and Erich Mendelsohn.\n\nCarlo Mollino loved the mountains and was a ski enthusiast; he wrote the book \"Trattato sul Discesismo\" where he explained his personal skiing technique with many illustrations. He designed some mountain houses like the Casa del Sole in Cervinia, Aosta Valley and the Slittovia of Lago Nero in Sauze d'Oulx, in Piedmont. In this work, all the art of Mollino is shown: a large, modern terrace protruding from the main volume contrasts with the traditional materials of the building. This building, placed on the ski runs and reachable during the winter only by ski, has been restored in 2001 and now contains temporary expositions.\n\nIn 1952, Mollino designed the RAI Auditorium in Turin, which was radically restored bringing big changes to the original structure in 2006.\n\nIn the first half of the sixties, he directed the team of architects responsible for the design of the INA-Casa district in Turin and he is placed second in the competition for the design of the Palazzo del Lavoro building in Turin, won by Pier Luigi Nervi, for the 100th anniversary celebration of the unification of Italy (1961).\n\nIn the last years of his life (between 1965 and 1973) he designed the two buildings that made him famous: the Camera di Commercio building and the Teatro Regio Torino (Regio Theater), both in Turin. Before his death he completed the projects for the FIAT Directional Centre in Candiolo, the AEM building in Turin, and the Club Mediterranèe in Sestriere.\n\n\n\nA world record price for a piece of 20th Century Furniture was set in June 2005 when a piece designed by Carlo Mollino was auctioned by Christie's New York: An oak and glass table for \"Casa Orengo\" from 1949 sold for $3,824,000.\n\nHis work was included in the exhibition \"Italy at Work\" 1950-54 which brought him and other Italian industrial designers to the attention of Americans.\n\nA huge collection of erotic polaroids taken by Mollino were discovered after his death. Each image was carefully composed with costumes, furniture and backdrops reflecting Mollino's refined aesthetic.\n\n"}

These elements are created within the cell and then assembled on its surface in a more or less regular arrangement, giving the test a textured appearance. There is a single opening for the long slender pseudopods, which capture food and pull the cell across the substrate.\n\nEuglyphids are common in soils, marshes, and other organic-rich environments, feeding on tiny organisms such as bacteria. The test is generally 30-100 μm in length, although the cell only occupies part of this space. During reproduction a second shell is formed opposite the opening, so both daughter cells remain protected. Different genera and species are distinguished primarily by the form of the test. \"Euglypha\" and \"Trinema\" are the most common.\n\nThe euglyphids are traditionally grouped with other amoebae. However, genetic studies instead place them with various amoeboid and flagellate groups, forming an assemblage called the Cercozoa.

In the naming of inorganic compounds, it is a suffix that indicates a polyatomic anion with a central aluminum atom.\n\nAluminium oxide (alumina) is amphoteric: it dissolves in both bases and acids. When dissolved in bases it forms hydroxyaluminate ions in the same way as aluminium hydroxide or aluminium salts. The hydroxyaluminate or hydrated aluminate can be precipitated and then calcined to produce anhydrous aluminates. Aluminates are often formulated as a combination of basic oxide and aluminium oxide, for example the formula of anhydrous sodium aluminate NaAlO would be shown as NaO·AlO. \nA number of aluminate oxyanions are known:\n\nThere are many mixed oxides containing aluminium where there are no discrete or polymeric aluminate ions. The spinels with a generic formula that contain aluminium as Al, such as the mineral spinel itself, MgAlO are mixed oxides with cubic close packed O atoms and aluminium Al in octahedral positions.\n\nBeAlO, chrysoberyl, isomorphous with olivine, has hexagonal close-packed oxygen atoms with aluminium in octahedral positions and beryllium in tetrahedral positions.\n\nSome oxides with the general formula of MAlO sometimes called aluminates or orthoaluminates such as YAlO, Yttrium ortho-aluminate are mixed oxides and have the perovskite structure.\nSome oxides such as YAlO, usually called YAG, have the garnet structure.\n\nThe anion is known in high pH solutions of Al(OH).\n\nAlumina on its own cannot easily be made glassy with current techniques, however with the addition of a second compound many types of aluminate glasses can be formed. The glasses produced display a range of interesting and useful properties, such as high refractive index, good infrared transparency, and high melting point, as well as the ability to host laser active and fluorescent ions. Aerodynamic levitation is a key method used to study and produce many aluminate glasses. Levitation allows high purity to be maintained in the melt at temperatures in excess of .\n\nSome materials that are known to form glass in binary combination with aluminum oxide are: rare earth oxides, alkaline earth oxides (CaO, SrO, BaO)\nlead oxide, and silicon dioxide.\n\nAlso, the AlO (aluminate) system has been discovered to form sapphire-like glass ceramics. Often, this ability is based upon compositions in which interplay between glass forming ability and glass stability is approximately balanced.\n\nSodium aluminate, NaAlO, is used industrially in dyeing to form a mordant and the hydrated forms are used in water purification, sizing of paper and in the manufacture of zeolites, ceramics and catalysts in the petrochemical industry. In the isomerization process of alkenes and amines Calcium aluminates are important ingredients of cements.\n\nLiAlO is used in the nuclear power industry.\n\nExamples are:\n\nA many recent research studies have focused on an effective solution for waste treatment. This has led some residues to be made into new raw materials for many industries. Such an achievement ensures a reduction in energy and natural resource usage, decreasing of the negative environmental impact and creating new fields of work.\n\nA good example comes from the metals industry, particularly the aluminum industry. Aluminum recycling is a beneficial activity for the environment, since it recovers resources from both manufacturing and consumer waste. Slag and scrap which were previously considered as waste, are now the raw material for some highly profitable new industries. There is added-value in materials made using an aluminum residue which is currently considered as a hazardous waste. Current research is investigating the use of this waste to manufacture glass, glass-ceramic, boehmite and calcium aluminate.\n"}

The band consisted of singer and bassist Mark Burgess, guitarists Reg Smithies and Dave Fielding, and drummer John Lever. They were called the Chameleons UK in North America because an American band had claim to \"the Chameleons\" name.\n\nThe band released their debut album, \"Script of the Bridge\", in 1983. They followed it with \"What Does Anything Mean? Basically\" and \"Strange Times\" in 1985 and 1986, respectively, before abruptly disbanding in 1987 due to the sudden death of the band's manager. After the split, Burgess and Lever formed the Sun and the Moon, while Fielding and Smithies formed the Reegs. Burgess also had a short solo career with backing band the Sons of God. \n\nThe Chameleons reformed in 2000, releasing the albums \"Strip\" (2000), \"Why Call It Anything\" (2001), and \"This Never Ending Now\" (2002). Renewed tensions caused the group to separate again in 2003. Burgess alone continues to play Chameleons songs live under the name ChameleonsVox. Lever died in 2017.\n\nKnown for their atmospheric, guitar-based sound, the Chameleons are regarded as one of the most underrated Manchester bands of the 1980s. They did not attain the commercial success of other groups from the Manchester scene but developed a cult following. \n\nThe Chameleons were formed in Middleton, Greater Manchester, England in 1981 by Mark Burgess, Reg Smithies and Dave Fielding. Burgess previously played with the Cliches, while Smithies and Fielding had performed with Years. They started as a trio—Burgess as vocalist and bassist, Smithies and Fielding both on guitar—without a drummer. They later recruited fellow Middletonian Brian Schofield, who was soon replaced by Dukinfield-based John Lever, previously of the Politicians. Former Magazine drummer Martin Jackson briefly replaced Lever during 1982–83 while the latter was on sabbatical.\n\nAfter performing several radio sessions for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, the band were signed to Epic Records, then a subsidiary of CBS Records International, and in March 1982 released their debut single, \"In Shreds\", which was produced by Steve Lillywhite. The single's cover – a harrowing painting by Smithies, who created the artwork for all of their releases – mirrored the band's tense, atmospheric sound. During this time, the Chameleons' independent style clashed with their label's visions for the band. Wary of the loss of credibilty Altered Images had suffered due to buckling to CBS' demands on packaging, the Chameleons were protective of their image and consequently were dropped by the label soon after the release of \"In Shreds\".\n\nThe Chameleons subsequently signed to UK label Statik Records, a subsidiary of Virgin Records, on which they released their debut studio album, \"Script of the Bridge\", in 1983. \"Script of the Bridge\", featuring the singles \"Up the Down Escalator\", \"As High as You Can Go\" and \"A Person Isn't Safe Anywhere These Days\", showcased Burgess's strong vocals and the band's guitar-based sound, with careful use of synthesisers. Statik's status as a subsidiary of Virgin prevented the band from qualifying for the independent charts, which resulted in reduced coverage by the British music press. MCA Records released the album in the United States in an abridged form, minus four songs, which angered the band. However, the US release and a 1984 American tour did earn them significant college radio airplay and a loyal fanbase.\n\nTheir second studio album, \"What Does Anything Mean? Basically\", was released in 1985 by Statik, which also reissued \"In Shreds\" and its B-side \"Less Than Human\" as the 12\" \"Nostalgia\" EP, adding the previously unreleased track \"Nostalgia\". \"Basically\" established the band as a promising, guitar-based group.\n\nRegular touring after the release of \"Basically\", along with efforts by the band's manager, Tony Fletcher, persuaded David Geffen to sign the band to Geffen Records, which released their third studio album, \"Strange Times\", in 1986. A dark, complex work, it contained the singles \"Tears\" and \"Swamp Thing\", but proved to be their final record of the period. A rift existed within the band, particularly between Burgess and Fielding, and Fletcher's sudden death in 1987 due to cardiac arrest led to the group disbanding.\n\nAfter the breakup, numerous spin-off bands emerged, none of which achieved much success. Burgess and Lever formed the Sun and the Moon, recruiting Andy Whitaker and Andy Clegg to replace Smithies and Fielding. They released an eponymous studio album on Geffen in 1988, but separated the next year. Burgess then embarked on a solo career, while the remaining members briefly continued on as Weaveworld. Smithies and Fielding formed the Reegs with the help of vocalist Gary Lavery and a drum machine, and released two albums, \"Return of the Sea Monkeys\" (1991) and \"Rock the Magic Rock\" (1992), on the independent label Imaginary Records.\n\nBurgess released his debut solo album, \"Zima Junction\", in 1993, and toured America the following year with his backing band the Sons of God. He released another studio album, \"Spring Blooms Tra-La\" (1994), as well as a live album, \"Manchester 93\" (1994), before partnering with Yves Altana in 1995, releasing \"Paradyning\" the same year. Afterwards, he founded Invincible with Altana and drummer Geoff Walker. They self-released their debut album, \"Venus\", in 1999, with most sales being digital. He also worked with Bird, the Messengers and Black Swan Lane. Lever later joined Bushart, who released the album \"Yesterday Is History\" (2008).\n\nIn 1990, the Chameleons posthumously released an EP, \"Tony Fletcher Walked on Water... La La La La La-La La-La-La\", with the title paying tribute to their former manager. They also issued numerous live albums and compilations.\n\nThe Chameleons reconvened in January 2000 to prepare for a series of concerts in The Witchwood, Ashton-under-Lyne, one of the band's favourite venues, in May. May 2000 also saw the release of the album \"Strip\", which featured old material in an acoustic format. The concerts were a success, and they expanded the reunion tour to include European dates in the summer and two California dates that fall. They released a new studio album, \"Why Call It Anything\", in 2001, followed by another unplugged album, \"This Never Ending Now\", in 2002 and a full American tour. Renewed tensions led to the band dissolving once again in early 2003.\n\nIn 2009, Burgess and Lever reformed to play Chameleons back catalogue material, under the name ChameleonsVox. They issued an EP, \"M+D=1(8)\", in November 2013. In addition to Burgess and Lever, ChameleonsVox line-ups have included guitarists Roger Lavallee,</small> Justin Lomery, Andrew Abernathy, Neil Dwerryhouse and Chris Oliver; bassists Frank Deserto and Jessica Espeleta; and drummers Glenn Maryansky, Yves Altana and Stephen Rice. Lever later went on to leave the band.\n\nIn 2014, Lever and Fielding reunited to record an album, \"Endless Sea\", as Red-Sided Garter Snakes. The album, featuring contributions from vocalist James Mudriczki of Puressence and Clegg, was released in July 2015.\n\nLever died on 13 March 2017, following a short illness, at the age of 55.\n\nDuring the Chameleons' early career, the British music press often used terms such as \"sonic architects\" and \"sonic cathedrals\" when describing the band, due to their atmospheric sound. Smithies and Fielding provided shimmering guitar riffs, while Lever and Burgess on drums and bass, respectively, gave the band a solid, rhythmic foundation.\n\nThe Chameleons emerged as Thatcherism was beginning to have its effect on England's former industrial towns, and their music was imbued with a sense of anxiety and a longing for the security of innocence. Burgess's impassioned vocal delivery complemented his lyrics, which touched on the alienation created in many British communities by the decline of manufacturing and industry, and the consequent disruption of social order. Despite the bleak landscapes they were surrounded by, the band were not weighed down by their environment, but attempted to triumph over it. Burgess said in 2013 that, though growing up in a post-industrial, northern town must have some influence on one's music, he felt the Chameleons would have sounded similar regardless of where they originated from.\n\n\n\nThe core quartet were augmented by keyboardists Alistair Lewthwaite and Andy Clegg for live shows in the 1980s, and by percussionist-vocalist Kwasi Asante during their reunion period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2230037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2230037", "title": "Kennedy half dollar", "text": "Kennedy half dollar\n\nThe Kennedy half dollar, first minted in 1964, is a fifty-cent coin currently issued by the United States Mint. Intended as a memorial to the assassinated 35th President of the United States John F. Kennedy, it was authorized by Congress just over a month after his death. Use of existing works by Mint sculptors Gilroy Roberts and Frank Gasparro allowed dies to be prepared quickly, and striking of the new coins began in January 1964.\n\nThe silver coins were hoarded upon their release in March 1964 by collectors and those interested in a memento of the late president. Although the Mint greatly increased production, the denomination was seldom seen in circulation. Continued rises in the price of silver increased the hoarding—many early Kennedy half dollars have been melted for their silver content. Starting with 1965-dated pieces, the percentage of fine silver was reduced from 90% to 40% (silver clad), but even with this change the coin saw little circulation.\n\nIn 1971, silver was eliminated entirely from the coins and production increased, but the half dollar still saw only a modest increase in usage. A special design for the reverse of the half dollar was issued for the United States Bicentennial and was struck in 1975 and 1976. In addition to business strikes, special collector coins were struck for the Bicentennial in silver clad; silver proof sets in which the dime, quarter and half dollar were struck in 90% silver were first minted in 1992. In 2014, a special edition of the Kennedy half dollar was also struck in 99.99% gold.\n\nEven though ample supplies of circulating half dollars are readily available from most banks, their circulation is still limited. Since 2002, Kennedy half dollars have only been struck to satisfy the demand from collectors, and are available at a premium through the Mint.\n\nWithin hours of the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Mint Director Eva Adams called Chief Engraver Gilroy Roberts, informing him that serious consideration was already being given to depicting Kennedy on one of the larger silver coins: either the silver dollar, half dollar, or quarter dollar. Adams called Roberts again on November 27 and authorized the project, stating that the late president's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy preferred that he be depicted on the half dollar, replacing the previous design of Benjamin Franklin. Mrs. Kennedy's reasoning was that she did not want to replace George Washington on the quarter.\n\nIn the interest of time (the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal. Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy. Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction, Roberts decided to make some changes after meeting him. After the Mint produced trial strikes, Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them. Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly. It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted that there was not enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.\nFrank Gasparro's reverse design of the Kennedy half dollar was also influenced by the experience he gained from designing the President John. F. Kennedy appreciation medal. In 1962, President Kennedy had three hundred appreciation medals struck by the United States Mint in Philadelphia that were later presented during his June 23, 1963 through July 2, 1963 trip to the nations of Federal Republic of Germany, Germany (West Berlin), Ireland, United Kingdom, Italy, and the Vatican City State. The reverse design of the Kennedy appreciation medal depicts a larger and more detailed Presidential Seal than the one he designed on the Mint's Presidential series (Bureau of the Mint Presidential series stock medal #135 known as the John F. Kennedy Presidential inauguration medal). Gasparro's placement of his initials FG is also similarly located (under the right leg of the eagle) on both the Kennedy appreciation medal and Kennedy half dollar.\n\nCongressional approval was required for any design change within 25 years of the last. In early December, Representative Henry Gonzalez (Democrat-Texas) introduced a bill for Kennedy to appear on the half dollar. On December 10, the new President, Lyndon Johnson, endorsed the call for a Kennedy half dollar, asking Congress to pass the legislation promptly to allow striking of the new piece to begin early in 1964. President Johnson stated that he had been moved by letters from many members of the public to agree with the plan. The bill to authorize the Kennedy half dollar passed on December 30, 1963. Work was already underway on coinage dies; the use of the already-available designs allowed for the completion of the first dies on January 2, 1964. Only proof coins were initially struck. The first Kennedy half dollars intended for circulation were struck at the Denver Mint on January 30, 1964, followed by the Philadelphia Mint the next week. A ceremonial first strike was held at both Philadelphia and Denver on February 11, 1964.\n\nThe Treasury Department made the coins available to the public beginning on March 24, 1964. A line a block long formed at the department's windows in Washington to purchase the 70,000 coins initially allocated for public sale. Although the department limited sales to 40 per customer, by the end of the day, the coins were gone, but the line had not shortened. Banks in Boston and Philadelphia quickly rationed supplies, but still sold out by noon. Sales in New York did not begin until the following day, and rationing was imposed there as well, to the disgruntlement of the head of the coin department at Gimbels, the largest dealer in the city, which had hoped to sell the coins at a premium.\n\nThe coins were popular overseas as well. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs G. Mennen Williams distributed plastic-encased specimens to presidents and foreign ministers of African nations and to the U.S. ambassadors serving there \"to win friends for the United States in Africa\". Shortly after the coin's release, the Denver Mint began receiving complaints that the new coin depicted a hammer and sickle on the bottom of Kennedy's truncated bust. In response, Roberts stated that the portion of the design in question was actually his monogram, a stylized \"\".\n\nThe Mint struck Kennedy half dollars in large numbers in an attempt to meet the overwhelming demand. The Treasury had initially planned to issue 91 million half dollars for 1964, but raised the number to 141 million. However, a public announcement of the increase failed to cause more coins to actually circulate or to decrease the prices on the secondary market. By late November, the Mint had struck approximately 160 million pieces, yet the coin was almost never seen in circulation. Silver prices were rising, and the majority of the coins were being hoarded. Hopeful that issuing more 1964-dated coins would counter the speculation in them, the Treasury requested and received Congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965. Eventually, almost 430 million half dollars dated 1964 were struck, a sum greater than the total struck for circulation in the sixteen years of the Franklin half dollar series.\n\nThese minting operations were rapidly depleting the Treasury's stock of silver. Prices for the metal were rising to such an extent that, by early June, a dime contained 9.33 cents' worth of silver at market prices. On June 3, 1965, President Johnson announced plans to eliminate silver from the dime and quarter in favor of a clad sandwich with layers of copper-nickel on each side of a layer of pure copper. The half dollar was changed from 90% silver to 40%. Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1965 in July. The new half dollars retained their silvery appearance, due to the outer layer being 80% silver and 20% copper. The coin was also minted with an inner layer of 21% silver and 79% copper. The first clad half dollars were struck at the Denver Mint on December 30, 1965. They bore the date 1965; the date would not be changed for US coins until the coin shortage was eased. Beginning on August 1, 1966, the Mint began to strike 1966-dated pieces, and thereafter it resumed the normal practice of striking the current year's date on each piece. Despite the proclaimed end to the coin shortage, Kennedy half dollars circulated little, a scarcity caused by continued hoarding and a dip in production, with the Treasury reluctant to expend more of the nation's silver holdings on a coin which did not circulate. According to coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers,\n\nIn May 1969, the Treasury sought authorization to eliminate the half dollar's silver content, changing it to the same copper-nickel clad composition as the dime and quarter. The Treasury also sought approval to strike copper-nickel clad one dollar coins, which would fill a need for gaming tokens in Western casinos. Former president Dwight D. Eisenhower had died recently, and there was discussion of placing Eisenhower's likeness on the new dollar. The Treasury hoped that with the removal of the silver content, the dollar coin would cease to be hoarded and again circulate. Despite the support of President Richard Nixon, some Republicans in the House of Representatives initially scuttled the legislation, disliking the idea of depicting Eisenhower on a base metal coin. The dispute dragged on for over a year before President Nixon signed a bill on December 31, 1970 which authorized production of the Eisenhower dollar and eliminated the remaining 40% silver content from the half dollar. As a result of the delay, in 1970 uncirculated (non-proof) half dollars were struck only at the Denver mint and were available solely in mint sets. With a mintage of 2.1 million, the 1970-D Kennedy half is considered the \"key\" coin in the series, although enough were produced to keep prices modest. To avoid hoarding and a potential shortage of the sets, the Mint did not announce that no 1970 half dollars would be struck for circulation until after ordering for the mint sets had closed.\n\nBy the time silver was eliminated from the half dollar and the base metal coins were issued in 1971, it had rarely been seen in circulation for so long that some banks had eliminated the slot for the denomination from machines. The Mint had anticipated a dramatic comeback for the denomination, but only a moderate increase in the usage of half dollars was noted after the 1971 clad coins were issued. In July 1971, Mint Director Mary Brooks disclosed that the Treasury was holding 200 million of the new base metal half dollars, as commercial banks expressed little interest in ordering them. \"I can't understand the population. They're not using them\", Brooks said. Also according to Brooks, most of the over one billion silver Kennedy half dollars had been hoarded by the public. Brooks theorized that because the silver Kennedy half dollar never circulated much and few halves were struck in 1970 in anticipation of the authorization of the new clad coins, the public had become accustomed to not seeing the half dollar in trade. Brooks suggested, \"If the country knew there were plenty of them around, they'd probably start hoarding them, too.\"\n\nOn March 5 1973, Brooks announced that the Mint would be soliciting new reverse designs for the half dollar and dollar to commemorate the 1976 United States Bicentennial. On October 18, President Nixon signed Public Law 93-127, which provided for new reverse designs for the quarter, half dollar, and dollar. The designs were to be emblematic of the Bicentennial era. The Mint announced a competition open to all American sculptors. Seth G. Huntington's design depicting Independence Hall was selected for the half dollar. All half dollars struck in 1975 and 1976 bore the double date 1776–1976 on the obverse and Huntington's design on the reverse. Over 521 million Bicentennial half dollars were struck for circulation.\n\nFollowing the high mintage of the Bicentennial coins, the number of half dollars struck per year declined. However, in 1979, Mint Director Stella B. Hackel indicated that the Mint would continue to strike them. \"We really don't think many half dollars are being used in commerce. They do go somewhere, though, so someone must want them.\" By then, more than 2.5 billion Kennedy half dollars had been struck since 1964, more than all previously struck US half dollars combined. \"The New York Times\" numismatic columnist Ed Reiter suggested that hoarding had continued even into the base-metal era, accounting for the shortage of halves in commerce. The silver boom of 1979–80 saw a large increase in the amount of sales and destruction of many hoarded 1964–69 silver Kennedy half dollars. Record high silver prices caused extensive melting of silver coins, especially half dollars and silver dollars for their metal content.\n\nThe coin continued to be struck through the remainder of the twentieth century, and mintage numbers remained relatively steady in both the Philadelphia and Denver mints until 1987, a year in which no half dollars were struck for circulation; the Treasury had accumulated a two-year supply of the pieces, making further production unnecessary. Demand for half dollars dropped, and casinos (where they were commonly used) increasingly began producing fifty cent chips to use in place of the coins. With mintage numbers remaining low, beginning in 2002, the Kennedy half dollar ceased to be struck for general circulation. Rolls and bags of the current year's pieces may be purchased from the Mint, at a premium above face value.\nIn 1991, subtle changes to the design of the half dollar were made. Most noticeable was the more prominent part in Kennedy's hair, as well as sharper detail to the hair in general; Kennedy's cheek bones were also made sharper and the entire bust of Kennedy was fractionally smaller. Beginning with the 2014 commemorative Kennedy half dollar issues, the mint reverted to the original 1964 design, which has been used every year since. In January 2014, a private firm on behalf of the Mint, began surveying customers on possible options for a special issue of the half dollar in commemoration of its 50th anniversary. In June, the Mint announced plans to issue seven special 2014 Kennedy half dollars in commemoration of the series' fiftieth anniversary: two in clad, from Philadelphia and Denver, four in silver from Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and the West Point Mint, and one in .9999 gold, from West Point. The clad and silver versions bear the normal date; the gold coin has the double date 1964–2014. All have higher relief than the usual issues. The gold coins were released in conjunction with the American Numismatic Association convention in Rosemont, Illinois on August 5, 2014.\n\nWith the exception of 1965 through 1967, proofs have been struck each year in the same metallic composition as regular issue pieces. The first Kennedy half dollar proofs were struck in early January 1964. Early strikes depicted Kennedy with heavily accented hair; an estimated 100,000 coins were struck with this feature. This was altered for the remainder of the mintage of nearly four million proof coins. Due to the coin shortage, the Treasury Department announced that no proof sets would be struck in 1965. Instead, Special Mint Sets would be struck to satisfy collector demand. Coins for these sets, minted at the San Francisco Assay Office, were struck with no mint marks early in 1966 with heavily polished dies dated 1965. Similar sets bearing the dates 1966 and 1967 were also struck. A few of the 1966 halves from the Special Mint Sets are known with Gasparro's initials \"\" missing from the reverse, apparently because of an overpolished die. The first year's production was sold in soft plastic packaging; the 1966 and 1967 issues were sonically sealed in hard plastic cases. In 1968, regular proof coinage was resumed, although production of proof coins was shifted to San Francisco, the \"S\" mintmark added and sets were encapsulated in hard plastic.\n\nIn 1973, Congress authorized silver-clad collector versions of the Bicentennial coins; in April 1975, the Mint began to strike them. The coins were issued in both proof and uncirculated quality. Copper-nickel clad Bicentennial coins were placed in both the 1975 and 1976 proof sets, while their silver clad counterparts were sold in three coin sets. Since 1992, the Mint has struck Kennedy half dollars in 90% silver for inclusion in special silver proof sets. 1964 proofs were struck in Philadelphia, and since 1968, proof coins have been struck in San Francisco only. In 1998, some silver proof pieces were struck to a matte finish for inclusion in a set along with a Robert Kennedy commemorative silver dollar. From 2005–2010, uncirculated pieces included in mint sets received a matte finish, which differentiates them from the pieces sold in bags and rolls.\n\nIn addition to the Accented Hair variety, one variety of the Kennedy half which receives significant interest due to its rarity is the 1964 Special Mint Set ('SMS') half dollar; Approximately 'a dozen or so' examples have been located over the course of the 2000s to the present day, and feature a 'satin finish' with well-defined strikes and die polishing lines. It is the rarest non-error variety of the Kennedy half known to date.\nExamples of this variety typically sell for significant amounts of money; a 1964 Special Mint Set half dollar sold for $47,000 in 2016. \n\n\n"}

The picture of the band in Santa outfits used on the cover was taken at the Aylesbury Fair, while the band were on tour.\n\nBronze also issued German and Spanish 7\" vinyl versions which had a different sleeves, as well as a Japanese release, with a colour picture insert with song lyrics in English and Japanese. One sided test pressings (not mis-presses, but used in the trade) escaped the pressing plant and are on the market.\n\nThe song opens with an overdriven bass intro played by Lemmy. For the lyrics, he said he \"used gambling metaphors, mostly cards and dice—when it comes to that sort of thing, I'm more into the one-arm bandits actually, but you can't really sing about spinning fruit, and the wheels coming down\".\n\nOn 6 September 1980, Lemmy was interviewed by Graham Neale on BBC Radio 1's \"Rock on Saturday\" show, \"Bomber\", \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Love Me Like a Reptile\" were played. The following month, on 6 and 20 October, the band played the song on BBC TV show \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nThe song spent 13 weeks in the UK Singles Chart, and originally peaked at number 15 upon its initial release. At the midweek point in January 2016 it reached No. 9 and in the official Friday chart they reached number 13, following the death of frontman Lemmy in December 2015 and subsequent dissolution of the band. It has sold 208,830 digital copies as of January 2016. It reached the top of the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts on 9 January 2016.\n\nThe song – which \"put a choke on the British music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed\" – is considered the definitive Motörhead anthem, albeit not by Lemmy. \"I don't see the song that way at all,\" he said in 2000. \"I believe we've done our best work since Eddie left the band in 1982.\"\n\nIn March 2005, \"Q\" placed it at No. 27 in a list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks, stating, \"This song has an intro which wouldn't be out of place ushering in the end of the world.\" In 2009, it was named the tenth greatest hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n\nIn 2014, \"NME\" ranked it number 155 in a list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nIn May 2019, \"Ace of Spades\" was named the favorite poker-themed song in a survey of 1,000 customers of online poker site PokerStars. The song reportedly \"not only won, but crushed\" the other finalist, \"Poker Face\" by Lady Gaga.\n\n\n\n\"Ace of Spades (live)\" is a 1988 7-inch vinyl release of the song by Motörhead. The single has no picture sleeve; it was issued (and withdrawn) in a plain white paper cover. All three songs on the single appeared on the band's \"No Sleep at All\" live album, which was recorded at the Giants of Rock Festival in Hämeenlinna, Finland on 2 July 1988.\n\nThe band had wanted \"Traitor\" as the A-side, but \"Ace of Spades\" was chosen instead, when the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops. So despite the popularity the song had achieved, this single was not as successful as the original version, which reached No. 15 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980, as it became only available at gigs and through the Motörheadbangers fan club.\n\nThe song became a staple of the band's live set, with Lemmy acknowledging that despite becoming \"sick\" of performing it, they \"can't ditch Ace of Spades, it wouldn't be right. If I go to see Little Richard, I expect to hear \"Good Golly Miss Molly\", or I'd be pissed off\". However, Lemmy softened his view on performing Ace of Spades live later on, saying \"I used to have that thought occasionally, but I killed it. \"Ace of Spades\" has been really good to us, and it's one of the best songs that I ever wrote. So I suppose you have to put up with it, because everybody wants to hear it, every night.\" Live versions have appeared on the albums \"No Sleep 'til Hammersmith\" (1981), \"Nö Sleep at All\" (1988), \"Everything Louder than Everyone Else\" (1999), \"Live at Brixton Academy\" (2003), \"\" (2007), \"\" (2011), \"\" (2012), and \"Clean Your Clock\" (2016).\n\nIt was the first song that Phil Campbell and Würzel played with the band – on the \"Bambi\" episode of \"The Young Ones\". The lineup is particularly rare until 1987: Lemmy, Campbell, Würzel and Taylor. Taylor had already left the band by the time the filming started, but kept to his promise of making the performance.\n\nIn September 1993, WGAF Records re-released the original 1980s track on CD-single, cassette single, 12\" vinyl picture sleeve and picture disc versions, the song was coupled with \"Louie Louie\", \"Dirty Love\", and \"Ace of Spades (The CCN Remix)\", and although the band were not too pleased with the CCN Remix version, this single peaked at No. 23 in the UK chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The species is native to the Mediterranean region, and while it is commonly sold in garden stores, it is considered an invasive plant in most places where it has been introduced.\n\nFrench broom, \"Genista monspessulana\", grows to tall, with slender green branches. The leaves are evergreen, trifoliate with three narrow obovate leaflets, long. The flowers are yellow, grouped 3-9 together in short racemes. Like other legumes, it develops its seeds within a pod. The pods are 2–3 cm long, tough and hard, and are transported easily by flowing water and animals. They burst open with force, dispersing the seeds several metres. The plant begins seed production once it reaches a height of approximately , and each plant can live for 10–20 years. One mature plant can produce 10,000 seeds per season. The generous seed production and the plant's ability to re-sprout after cutting or burning help it to invade new habitat vigorously when introduced.\nIt is related to the common broom and Spanish broom. This suite of plants is common in European shrublands. French broom was originally distributed throughout Mediterranean Europe and northwest Africa, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. Due to its lower tolerance for frost than other broom species, it is common in warmer, lower elevation areas. It is found on coastal strips and in sunny inland areas, and does best with plentiful rainfall and sandy soils.\n\nWhen introduced to a new area, French broom can become an invasive plant. Its reproductive vigour and preference for Mediterranean climates make it a very successful species in California and the Pacific Northwest, where it is considered a severe noxious weed, covering over 40,000 hectares. It is even more widespread in Australia, where it covers 600,000 hectares and is also considered a noxious weed.\n\nThe plant often outcompetes native vegetation, forming dense fields where other species are almost completely crowded out. Stands of French broom can be so thick that they make meadows and pastures useless for wild and domestic animals. Other harmful effects include its ability to shade out tree seedlings in reforested areas, its tendency to catch fire, and the toxicity of its leaves and seeds, which contain alkaloids poisonous to many large domestic animals.\n\n\n"}

The station is located in the Whalley / City Centre district of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, just east of the North Surrey Recreation Centre. The station is within walking distance of the Central City shopping centre, Surrey City Hall, and SFU Surrey, the Surrey campus of Simon Fraser University.\n\nSurrey Central station was opened in 1994 along with two other stations when the Expo Line was extended from Scott Road station farther into Whalley, to the \"Surrey City Centre\" district. Prior to the opening of the station, there was a bus loop on the site known as \"Whalley Exchange\", which opened in 1975. The station was briefly known as \"Whalley Central\" during planning; however, the name \"Surrey Central\" was chosen after an ad was placed in the local paper calling on residents to propose an appropriate name.\n\nOver the years, the station has earned a reputation for being unsafe and a magnet for crime, including violence and drug trafficking. In 2009, it had the second-highest number of violent crimes in the SkyTrain system (with Commercial–Broadway station having the highest).\n\nIn an effort to combat the station's rundown image, and to show off experimental urban design, the City of Surrey and TransLink agreed to have Surrey Central station participate in the GVTA's Urban Transit Village program. The Transit Villages were defined by TransLink as \"a new approach to station design and access.\" While the original schedule called for construction to be completed by the second quarter of 2007, nothing beyond design plans were completed. The Surrey Central plan specifically called for improvements in four areas: station access, street design, King George Boulevard, and land use.\n\nOfficers from the Metro Vancouver Transit Police can be found patrolling the bus loop and SkyTrain platform in an effort to reduce crime and disorder, with supplemental volunteers patrolling the area and reporting any suspicious or dangerous behaviour. By the mid-2010s, with extensive police patrols and redevelopment of the area, violent crimes shifted from Whalley south to Newton, which has taken over the area's reputation of being the most dangerous part of Surrey.\n\nIn March 2017, station upgrades started on Surrey Central station to create two new entrances on the north side of the station at Central Avenue and City Parkway to reduce congestion. Accessibility and lighting was also improved with three additional escalators and an elevator. Construction work was completed in February 2019, and the new stationhouse opened to the public in March 2019.\n\nSurrey Central station is a transfer point for twenty-one TransLink bus routes that serve Surrey, White Rock, North Delta, Ladner, Tsawwassen, and Langley, the highest number of bus route connections at any station in the SkyTrain network, although that record became shared with Coquitlam Central station with the opening of the Evergreen Extension.\n\n\nBus bay assignments are as follows:\n!

It is a perennial plant that grows in wet places such as marshes, stream banks, slough margins, ditches, meadows, and wet pastures. The roots are thick and tuberous, with many smaller tubers on the main tuber, allowing survival in wet conditions. Water hemlock is most abundant in British Columbia, and is indigenous to North America, where it grows primarily from the base of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast, stretching from Alaska all the way to California. Water requirements limit this plant from inhabiting open rangelands.\n\nCharacteristics of water hemlock include its stem, which is 0.5–2 meters tall with purplish spots, thick roots, and alternate leaves that are compound pinnate. The leaflets are usually 5–8 cm long and 1–2 cm wide, with jagged edges. Its inflorescences are compound umbellate with many small, white flowers. There are two seeds per flower. Seed dispersal is by means of wind, water, machinery, clothing, and through transported soil. The seeds germinate in spring, and flowers mature near the end of June and beginning of July. In addition to sprouting new plants from seeds, rootstocks can also produce new plants in the fall from the basal meristem. When these detach the following spring, they may form a new plant.\n\nThe main distinguishing characteristic of western water hemlock is its toxicity. Cicutoxin is the toxin that is produced, making water hemlock the most poisonous plant in North America. Cicutoxin is a yellowish liquid that is prevalent in the roots. This unsaturated alcohol has a major impact on the central nervous system of animals. Early symptoms of cicutoxin poisoning include excessive salivation, frothing at the mouth, nervousness, and incoordination. These symptoms can progress to tremors, muscular weakness, seizures and respiratory failure. Ingestion of green materials of western water hemlock in amounts equivalent to about 0.1% of a person's body weight can even lead to death. In addition to being extremely hazardous to humans, this plant has an enormous impact on animals. As little as 0.2–0.5% body weight for sheep, 0.1% body weight for cattle, 0.5% body weight for horses, and 0.3% body weight for swine can be lethal. Death can occur within fifteen minutes of ingesting the toxin. It is one of the first plants to emerge in springtime, and has a very appealing odor. These characteristics, along with the fact that it grows in moist areas, make the plant very attractive, but deadly, to grazing animals.\n\n"}

It was the first C compiler for CP/M. It was written by Leor Zolman and first released in 1979 when he was 20 years old. \"BDS\" stands for \"Brain Damage Software.\"\n\nBDS C was popular and influential among CP/M users and developers in the 8-bit microcomputer era. It ran much faster and was more convenient to use than other Z80-hosted compilers of the time. It was possible to run BDS C on single-floppy machines with as little as 30K of RAM in comparison to most other commercial compilers which required many passes and the writing of intermediate files to disk. Around 75,000 copies were sold, including a stripped down Japanese incarnation.\n\nA number of important commercial CP/M products were written in the BDS C subset (no long integer, no floating-point arithmetic) of the C language, including PeachText from PeachTree Software, MINCE and Scribble from Mark of the Unicorn, and most of the software in the Perfect Software suite including Perfect Writer, PerfectCalc, PerfectSpeller and PerfectFiler (which suite was bundled with the Kaypro).\n\nWeak points of BDS C were that the floating point math routines and the file access functions were incompatible with the Unix C compiler's and its relocatable object files were not compatible with the Microsoft assembler, making it more difficult to integrate C code with assembly language.\n\nBDS C was bundled with a subset of the Unix system written in about 1980, called MARC (Machine Assisted Resource Coordinator). This effort in some ways resembled GNU, though MARC was to be able to run CP/M software through emulation. Unfortunately MARC's author, Ed Ziemba, perished in a snorkeling accident before he could complete the project.\n\nIn 2002, Leor Zolman released the 8080 assembly language source code for BDS C into the public domain.\n\n\n"}

He studied architecture from 1893 to 1897 at the Technical University of Munich under Friedrich von Thiersch and at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Friedrich von Schmidt. He then worked as a building inspector and planner in Nuremberg, Regensburg, and at the University of Munich, where he designed an extension to the main building that was built in 1906–10.\n\nIn 1910 he was appointed to a professorship at the Technical University of Dresden; the following year he transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1915 to the Academy of Fine Arts Berlin. In 1919 he also became a professor at the Technical University of Berlin-Charlottenburg. In 1922 he returned to Munich as a professor at the Technical University, and from 1934 until his death in 1942 he was President of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nBestelmeyer was an outspoken advocate of traditionalist, \"völkisch\" architecture. He was a member of the Munich School to which Paul Troost also belonged. In 1928, with Paul Schultze-Naumburg, Paul Schmitthenner and others, he founded \"The Block\", a group of architects in opposition to the modernist group The Ring. He was singled out for praise in 1931 by Schultze-Naumburg and in 1934, after the Nazis came to power, wrote an article in which he endorsed Alexander von Senger's criticism of Le Corbusier, described 1920s architecture as having become \"soulless\", and rejected flat roofs as unsuited to the climate in Germany. He was a member of both the Werkbund and the antisemitic Militant League for German Culture. He became a Reich Cultural Senator in 1935. He brought von Senger to the Bavarian Academy and designed buildings such as the Luftwaffe office building on the Prinzregentenstraße, which were much praised at the time. However, he also designed a number of mostly Protestant churches, some of which met with official approval, and Hitler chose his design for the Mangfall Bridge, a girder bridge on two massive concrete pylons carrying one of the new autobahns, which was influential in its simple modernity and size.\n\nBestelmeyer died in 1942 at the resort of Bad Wiessee. On Hitler's orders, his body was brought back to Munich and after lying in state in the Academy of Fine Arts, transferred for the state funeral to the light-court of the University of Munich which he had designed, with 300 members of the Hitler Youth in attendance.\n\n\n\n"}

It is accessible by Forest Road 151, a 13-mile dirt road off of US route 84.\n\nThe monastery was founded in 1964 by Aelred Wall, O.S.B., a monk of Mount Savior Monastery in Pine City, New York.\n\nThe original monastery was designed by George Nakashima. The chapel was praised by Thomas Merton as the most perfect monastic chapel he had ever visited.\n\nChrist in the Desert follows the Benedictine life without an external apostolate. It has a guesthouse in which men and women can stay and join the monks in the chapel to share in the monastic Divine Office and in the Mass.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the guesthouse, the monks manage a gift shop of books and religious items, which is accessible online and by mail order. The monks also work in agriculture, crafts, computer work and maintenance of the grounds and facilities.\n\nChrist in the Desert has three dependent monasteries. Two are in Mexico (Nuestra Senora de la Soledad and Monasterio Benedictino De Santa María y Todos Los Santos) and the other is in Kerens, Texas (Benedictine Monastery of Thien Tam). These monasteries also observe the Benedictine life with no apostolate other than a guesthouse.\n\nThe monastery maintains one of the largest private solar power systems in the US, which provides its only source of electricity.\n\nThe monastery comprises men from many nations. English is the common language of the house.\n\nIn 2006 the monastery was the setting for a TLC documentary program entitled \"The Monastery\". The documentary was produced by Tiger Aspect of the UK for the TLC cable network in the US.\n\nThe series followed the experiences of five laymen who lived in the monastery and observed the monastic way of life for forty days. The series was filmed in early 2006 and was originally broadcast in five episodes in the US on the TLC network in Oct-Nov 2006.\n\nIn 1995 the monastery published a website, \"www.christdesert.org\", that became one of the world's most visited websites in the years 1995-1997.

He joined the NSDAP in 1930 and was an important advocate of Nazi architecture and a leading critic of modern architecture.\n\nSchultze-Naumburg was born in Almrich (now part of Naumburg) in the current federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, and by 1900 was a well-known painter and architect, first emerging as a more-conservative member of the group of artists who established the Jugendstil and the Arts and Crafts workshops in Munich. His series of books the \"Kulturarbeiten\" (\"Works of Culture\"), nine volumes published 1900–1917, were extremely popular and established him as a major tastemaker for the German middle class. By the First World War, he had become a major proponent of traditional architecture, an originator of the \"Circa 1800\" movement, and an important voice in both the Deutscher Werkbund and the nationalist German architecture and landscape preservation movement. A well-known example of his architecture from this time is the Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam, built by order of Wilhelm II for his son, crown prince Wilhelm in 1914–1917.\n\nOn 5 January 1922 Paul Schultze-Naumburg married in Saaleck Margarete Karolina Berta Dörr (1896–1960). They were childless and divorced nastily on 7 February 1934. A couple of weeks later Margarete married the Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick.\n\nIn response to the defeat of the First World War and of his own marginalization in the interwar architectural discourse, Schultze-Naumburg's articles and books began to take on a far harsher and less progressive character, condemning modern art and architecture in racial terms, thereby providing much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's theories in which classical Greece and the Middle Ages were the true sources of Aryan art. Schultze-Naumburg wrote such books as \"Die Kunst der Deutschen. Ihr Wesen und ihre Werke\" (\"The Art of the Germans. Its Nature and Its Works\") and \"Kunst und Rasse\" (\"Art and Race\"), the latter published in 1928, in which he argued that only \"racially pure\" artists could produce a healthy art which upheld timeless ideals of classical beauty, while racially \"mixed\" modern artists showed their inferiority and corruption by producing distorted artwork. As evidence of this, he reproduced examples of modern art next to photographs of people with deformities and diseases, graphically reinforcing the idea of modernism as a sickness.\n\nAlong with Alexander von Senger, Eugen Honig, Konrad Nonn, and German Bestelmeyer, Schultze-Naumburg was a member of a National Socialist para-governmental propaganda unit called the Kampfbund deutscher Architekten und Ingenieure (KDAI).\n\nIn September 1944, he was named as one of the first rank of artists and writers important to Nazi culture in the Gottbegnadeten list.\n\nSchultze-Naumburg died in Jena in 1949.

Generally, authentication can be shown in one of two ways. First, a witness can testify as to the chain of custody through which the evidence passed from the time of the discovery up until the trial. Second, the evidence can be authenticated by the opinion of an expert witness examining the evidence to determine if it has all of the properties that it would be expected to have if it were authentic.\n\nFor handwritten documents, any person who has become familiar with the purported author's handwriting prior to the cause of action from which the trial arose can testify that a document is in that handwriting.\n\nThere are several kinds of documents which have generally been deemed to be self-authenticating documents. These include commercial labels, newspapers and other periodicals, and official publications of an arm of the government.\n\nA special category of evidence called an ancient document will be deemed authentic if it can be shown to be more than twenty years old, and found in a place and condition that a document of that age would likely be found.\n"}
