{"id": "2195653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195653", "title": "Lady Triệu", "text": "Lady Triệu\n\nLady Triệu (Vietnamese: \"Bà Triệu\", Sino-Vietnamese: 趙嫗 \"Triệu Ẩu\"; 225–248) was a female warrior in 3rd century Vietnam who managed, for a time, to resist the Chinese state of Eastern Wu during its occupation of Vietnam. She is also called Triệu Thị Trinh, although her actual given name is unknown. She is quoted as saying, \"\"I'd like to ride storms, kill sharks in the open sea, drive out the aggressors, reconquer the country, undo the ties of serfdom, and never bend my back to be the concubine of whatever man.\"\"\n\nIn Vietnam, Lady Trieu is most commonly called Bà Triệu, but also Triệu Ẩu (趙嫗), Triệu Trinh Nương (趙貞娘), and Triệu Thị Trinh (趙氏貞). Chinese records do not mention Lady Trieu, the only mention comes in Vietnamese sources. There are two late Vietnamese compilations that mention her by name. One is the official Lê dynasty history, \"Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư\" (1479), and other is the official Nguyễn dynasty history, \"Khâm định Việt sử Thông giám cương mục\" (1871). Both sources give her name as \"Triệu Ẩu\" (). This translates to \"Bà Triệu\" in modern Vietnamese, and to \"Lady Trieu\" in English. The given name \"Thị Trinh\" first appears only in \"Việt Nam sử lược\" (\"Outline History of Vietnam\") (1920) by Trần Trọng Kim. Many cities in Vietnam have a street named \"Bà Triệu\" in her honor.\n\n\"Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư\" (大越史記全書 \"Complete annals of Great Viet\"), written during the Lê dynasty, said the following about Lady Trieu:\n\n\"The Mậu Thìn year, [248], (11th year of Hán Diên Hy (Han Yanxi 漢延熙); 11th year of Xích Ô (Chiwu 赤烏)). The people of Cửu Chân (Jiuzhen 九真) again attacked citadels, the prefecture was in rebellion. The Wu king appointed the “Hành Dương” Imperial Secretist Lục Dận [Lu Yin] (some books say Lục Thương) to Inspector of Jiaozhou. Dận arrived, used the people's respect for him to call them to lay down arms, people surrendered, numbering more than 30,000 households, and the prefecture was once again peaceful. Afterwards, a woman from the Cửu Chân commandery named Triệu Ẩu assembled people and attacked several commanderies (Ẩu has breasts 3 thước [1.2 m] long, tied them behind her back, often rides elephants to fight). Dận was able to subdue [her]. (Giao Chỉ records only write: In the mountains of Cửu Chân commandery there is a woman with the surname Triệu, with breasts 3 thước long, unmarried, assembled people and robbed the commanderies, usually wearing yellow tunics, feet wearing shoes with curved fronts, and fights while sitting on an elephant's head, becoming an immortal after she dies). \n\n\"Viet Nam sử lược\" (\"A Brief history of Vietnam\"), a history book that was written in the early 20th century by Vietnamese historian Trần Trọng Kim, said the following about Lady Trieu:\n\"In this year on Cửu Chân prefecture, there was a woman named Triệu Thị Chinh who organized a revolt against the Ngô [Wu].\"\n\n\"Our [Vietnamese] history recorded that lady Trieu was a people of Nông Cống district. Her parents were dead all when she was a child, she lived with her older brother Trieu Quoc Dat. At the age of 20, while she was living with her sister-in-law who was a cruel woman, she [Trieu Thi Trinh] killed her [sister-in-law] and went to the mountain. She was a strong, brave and smart person. On the mountain, she gathered a band of 1.000 followers.\" \"Her brother tried to persuade her from rebelling, she told him: \"\"I only want to ride the wind and walk the waves, slay the big whales of the Eastern sea, clean up frontiers, and save the people from drowning. Why should I imitate others, bow my head, stoop over and be a slave? Why resign myself to menial housework?\"\".\n\n\"The Mậu Thìn year, [248], because of the cruelty of Ngô [Wu] mandarins and misery of people, Trieu Quoc Dang revolted in Cửu Chân prefecture. Lady Trieu led her troops joined her brother's rebellion, soldiers of Trieu Quoc Dat made her leader because of her braveness. When she went to battles, she usually wore yellow tunics and rode a war-elephant. She proclaimed herself Nhụy Kiều Tướng quân (The Lady General clad in Golden Robe).\"\n\n\"Giao Châu Inspector Lục Dận sent troops to fight [her], she [Trieu Thi Trinh] had managed to fight back the Ngô [Wu] forces for 5 or 6 months. Because of the lack of troops and fighting alone, she [Trieu Thi Trinh] could not manage to fight a long war and was defeated. She fled to Bồ Điền commune (present-day Phú Điền commune, Mỹ Hóa district) and then committed suicide.\"\n\n\"Later, the Nam Đế (Southern Emperor) of Early Lý dynasty praised her as a brave and loyal person and ordered [his followers] build her a temple, and gave her the title of \"\"Bật chính anh hùng tài trinh nhất phu nhân\"\" (Most Noble, Heroic and Virgin Lady). Present day in Phú Điền commune, in the Thanh Hóa province there is a temple [for her].\"\n\nIn the book \"Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945\" written by David G. Marr, an American Professor, told the story of Trieu Thi Trinh as follow: Trieu Thi Trinh was a woman who had breasts. She also had a voice which sounded like a temple bell, and she could eat many rice pecks and walk 500 leagues per day. Moreover, Trinh had a beauty that could shake any man's soul. Because of repeated altercations, she killed her sister and went to a forest in which she gathered a small army and attacked the Chinese. When her brother tried to persuade her from rebelling, she told him:\n\nI only want to ride the wind and walk the waves, slay the big whales of the Eastern sea, clean up frontiers, and save the people from drowning. Why should I imitate others, bow my head, stoop over and be a slave? Why resign myself to menial housework?\n\nAfter hearing Trinh's words, her brother decided to join her. At first the Chinese underestimated Trinh for her being a female leader but after some encounters, they feared her because of her gaze. Three centuries later, she still offered spiritual support for male Vietnamese opponent of the Chinese. In the Lý dynasty she was honored by the court with a lot of posthumous titles. During the Lê dynasty, Neo-Confucianism became Vietnam's national ideology and many scholars aggressively tried to bring the practices of Trieu Thi Trinh into conformity with Neo-Confucianism. Nevertheless, she survived all their manipulations.\n\nChinese records make no mention of Trieu Thi Trinh. All available information comes solely from Vietnamese sources that were written during or after the late Ming dynasty. However, the \"Sanguozhi\" (Records of the Three Kingdoms), a classical Chinese historical account, does mention a rebellion at this time in the commanderies of Jiaozhi (交趾; Vietnamese: Giao Chỉ) and Jiuzhen (九真, Vietnamese: Cửu Chân):\n\n\"“In the 11th year of Chiwu (赤烏) [248] in Jiaozhi (交趾), Jiuzhen (九真) rebels attacked walled cities which caused a great uproar. Lu Yin (陸胤) [of Hengyang (衡陽) ] was given rank of the Inspector of Jiaozhou by the Sovereign of Wu. He took his troops and entered the southern border and sent word to the rebels. He used his craftiness to convince them to accept his terms. [In] Gaoliang (高涼), the commander Huang Wu (黄吳) with 3,000 households came out to surrender. Lu Yin now led the army south to that region. He announced his sincerity [to the aborigines] and distributed gifts. The [remaining] 100 rebel leaders and 50,000 households, who had been unruly and unapproachable, kowtowed [to Lu Yin]. Thus the territory was handed over peacefully. At once Lu Yin was given the rank of General who Tranquilizes the South. Again he was sent on a punitive expedition against the rebels in Cangwu (蒼梧). He defeated them quickly. From start to finish Lu Yin's military troops totaled 8,000. (Later commentaries also cited that Lu Yin then helped to plant crops and kept the people fed.)”\"\n\nKeith W. Taylor, an American professor, explained these differences as following:\n\n\"“Chinese records do not mention Lady Trieu; our knowledge of her comes only from Vietnamese sources. From this it is evident that the events of 248 were remembered differently by the two sides. The Chinese only recorded their success in buying off certain rebel leaders with bribes and promises. The resistance led by Lady Trieu was for them simply a kind of stubborn barbarism that was wiped out as a matter of course and was of no historical interest. On the other hand, the Vietnamese remembered Lady Trieu's uprising as the most important event of the time. Her leadership appealed to strong popular instincts. The traditional image of her as a remarkable yet human leader, throwing her yard-long breasts over her shoulders when going into battle astride an elephant, has been handed down from generation to generation. After Lady Trieu's death, her spirit was worshipped by the Vietnamese. We owe our knowledge of her to the fact that she was remembered by the people.”\"\n\nTriệu Thị Trinh is a greatly celebrated hero and many streets are named after her in Vietnamese cities (there are Bà Triệu streets in Huế, Hà Nội, Ho Chi Minh City, and several other cities).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195701", "title": "Burt Shotton", "text": "Burt Shotton\n\nBurton Edwin Shotton (October 18, 1884 – July 29, 1962) was an American player, manager, coach and scout in Major League Baseball. As manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers (1947; 1948–50), he won two National League pennants and served as Jackie Robinson's first permanent Major League manager.\n\nShotton was born in Brownhelm, a township in Lorain County, Ohio. In his playing days, he was a speedy outfielder — he was nicknamed \"Barney\" after race car driver Barney Oldfield — who batted left-handed and threw right-handed. The , Shotton compiled a .271 batting average with 1,338 hits in 1,387 Major League games played for the St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators and St. Louis Cardinals (1909; 1911–23).\n\nAlthough he stole over 40 bases in four consecutive seasons (1913–16), he was also caught stealing over 26 times in each of those seasons. In an American League dominated by speedsters such as Ty Cobb and Clyde Milan, Shotton was never among the top five base stealers in the league, and he had a high rate of being caught stealing, but he pilfered 294 bases during his MLB career. His real talent, however, may be shown in his on-base percentage, in which he finished in the top ten in the league four times in his career. He twice (in 1913 and 1916) led AL batters in walks, and finished in the top ten six seasons.\n\nIn the early 1920s, as a player and coach, he was the Cardinals' \"Sunday manager\", relieving skipper Branch Rickey, who always observed the Christian Sabbath. Rickey and Shotton had formed a longstanding friendship and professional relationship dating back to their years together (1913–15) with the Browns, when Rickey was his manager. After Shotton retired as a player, he was on the Cardinals' coaching staff from 1923–25 until he took over as manager of their top farm club, the Syracuse Stars of the International League, in 1926–27.\n\nShotton's first formal Major League managing opportunity came with the NL's then-habitual tailending team, the Philadelphia Phillies. He lasted six seasons (1928–33) with the Phils, who twice lost more than 100 games during his tenure. The Shotton-era Phillies included two notable teams. The 1930 edition compiled a team batting average of .315 (paced by Chuck Klein's .386 and Lefty O'Doul's .380) and scored 944 runs; but the Phillie pitching staff allowed 1,199 runs and posted a horrendous 6.71 earned run average as the team finished last, at 52–102. Then, only two years later, the 1932 club compiled a 78–76 record, good enough for fourth place in the National League. It would be the Phillies' only winning season and first-division finish between 1917 and . Altogether, Shotton's win-loss mark in Philadelphia was 370–549 (.403).\n\nShotton then coached for the Cincinnati Reds in 1934. On July 28, he had a one-game stint as interim manager after the firing of Bob O'Farrell and before new skipper Chuck Dressen arrived from Nashville to take command of the last-place Reds; in that game, Cincinnati defeated the Chicago Cubs, 11–2. Then Shotton returned to the Cardinals for a seven-year term (1935–41) managing their top-level Rochester Red Wings and Columbus Red Birds farm clubs, and spent four years (1942–45) on the coaching staff of player-manager Lou Boudreau of the Cleveland Indians.\n\nBut prior to the season, Shotton hung up his uniform and settled into a scouting role for the Brooklyn Dodgers, for whom Rickey was now part-owner, president and general manager.\n\nOn the eve of the 1947 season, Shotton received a telegram from Rickey; it read: \"Be in Brooklyn in the morning. Call nobody, see no one\". Flying immediately from his Florida home to New York, not knowing what to expect, Shotton was ushered into Rickey's presence. Leo Durocher, the Dodgers' manager since 1939, had been suspended for the entire 1947 campaign by Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler for \"conduct detrimental to baseball.\" In his search for a temporary replacement, Rickey had been rebuffed by former New York Yankees manager Joe McCarthy, then in retirement, and two of Durocher's coaches, Clyde Sukeforth (who managed the first two games of the season on an emergency basis) and Ray Blades.\n\nRickey pleaded with Shotton to take over the Dodgers for the remainder of the season. Then 62, and convinced that his on-field career was over, Shotton reluctantly took the reins on April 18, still in street clothes. (Shotton was one of the last baseball managers to wear everyday apparel rather than the club uniform. Unlike Connie Mack, however, he did usually add his team's cap and jacket.)\n\nHe inherited a contending Brooklyn team that had finished in a flatfooted tie for the National League pennant before losing a playoff series to the Cardinals. He also inherited what historian Jules Tygiel called \"Baseball's Great Experiment\" — the Dodgers' breaking of the infamous color line by bringing up Jackie Robinson from their Triple-A Montreal Royals farm club at the start of the 1947 season to end over sixty years of racial segregation in baseball. The rookie was facing withering insults from opposing players, and a petition by Dodger players protesting Robinson's presence had only recently been quashed by Durocher.\n\nShotton's calm demeanor, however, provided the quiet leadership the Dodgers needed. They won the National League pennant by five games, and took the New York Yankees to seven games in the 1947 World Series. In Game 4, Shotton helped to thwart Bill Bevens' no-hit bid in the ninth inning, sending into the game two pinch hitters and two pinch runners in an attempt to overcome a 2–1 deficit. The gambit worked, as Dodger pinch hitter Cookie Lavagetto drove home both pinch runners, Al Gionfriddo and Eddie Miksis, with his opposite-field double — Brooklyn's only hit — for a 3–2 victory.\n\nWith Durocher's suspension over, Shotton retired again, this time to a front office post as \"managerial consultant\" in the Dodgers' vast farm system. But the 1948 Dodgers did not respond to Durocher's return; they even (briefly, on May 24) fell into the NL cellar. Durocher was still under siege by the Catholic Youth Organization because of his extramarital relationship with, and then quick marriage to, actress Laraine Day.\n\nWith the New York Giants also floundering, owner Horace Stoneham decided to replace his manager, Mel Ott, with Shotton. He called Rickey to ask permission to speak with Shotton about the Giants' job, and was stunned when Rickey offered him the opportunity to hire Durocher instead. On July 16, 1948, Durocher moved from Brooklyn to Upper Manhattan to take over the Giants. The following day, Shotton was back in the Dodger dugout — still in street clothes. On that day, Brooklyn was 37–37 and in fourth place, 8 games behind the Boston Braves.\n\nAfter his return, the Dodgers rallied to take the lead in the 1948 NL standings by the end of August, before they faltered in September to finish third, 7 games behind Boston. Then, in , Shotton won his second pennant, with Brooklyn capturing 97 regular-season victories to finish a game ahead of the Cardinals. Robinson won the National League's Most Valuable Player award and batting championship. But Brooklyn again bowed to the Yankees in the World Series, this time in only five games. Despite Shotton's two pennants in three seasons, he continually faced criticism from Durocher loyalists on the Dodgers, who claimed that Shotton was a poor game strategist and lacked Durocher's competitive intensity. Because he eschewed wearing a uniform, Shotton was prohibited from stepping onto the field of play during games to argue with umpires and make pitching changes; those tasks fell to one of his uniformed coaches.\n\nShotton also had severe critics within the press, notably \"New York Daily News\" baseball writer Dick Young, who came to refer to him in print only by the derisive acronym \"KOBS\", short for \"Kindly Old Burt Shotton.\" Shotton's poor relationship with the New York media partly was self-inflicted: according to author Roger Kahn, he attempted to ban Young from the Brooklyn clubhouse, and alienated and infuriated the \"New York Herald-Tribune\"s Harold Rosenthal by repeatedly addressing him as \"Rosenberg\" and \"Rosenbloom.\"\n\nIn 1950, despite chronic pitching woes, Shotton guided the Dodgers to within a game of first place on the final day of the season. But Dick Sisler's tenth-inning home run off Don Newcombe won the pennant for the Phillies' \"Whiz Kids\", and ended both the Dodger season and Shotton's managerial career. Rickey was forced from the Brooklyn front office by new majority owner Walter O'Malley at the end of October. At his home in Bartow, Florida, Shotton ignored O'Malley's repeated suggestions that he fly to Brooklyn to \"discuss [his] future\", declaring, \"I don't intend to go all the way up there just to be fired.\" Indeed, O'Malley had already decided on Chuck Dressen as his new manager; his hiring was formally announced November 28. In contrast to Shotton, the fiery Dressen would be conspicuous on the field wearing uniform No. 7 and doubling as Brooklyn's third-base coach.\n\nShotton's last connection with baseball was as a consultant for Rickey's Continental League, the planned \"third major league\" that ultimately forced expansion of MLB in 1961–62. In 1960, Rickey, the CL president, engaged Shotton to assist and supervise the managers in the Western Carolinas League, a Class D minor league originally set up to groom talent for the CL.\n\nShotton died in Lake Wales, Florida, from a heart attack at age 77 during the second All-Star break in 1962. Although his career win-loss record as a big league manager was 697–764 (.477), his mark with the Dodgers was 326–215 (.603).\n\nAccording to an informal study by researchers at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the last manager to wear street clothes is believed to be Shotton, who last managed a game on Sunday, October 1, 1950. (Connie Mack, who famously wore a full suit during his 50 years as manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, also retired on October 1, 1950, but his game that day ended earlier.)\n\nIn the 2013 film \"42\", Shotton is played by Max Gail.\n\n\n"}

At the time of recording, Sarah Cracknell was not fully part of the group, and as a result she does not sing on \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\", which is sung by Moira Lambert.\n\n\"Foxbase Alpha\" was on the short list of nominees for the 1992 Mercury Prize. It was accompanied by several successful singles, including \"Nothing Can Stop Us.\"\n\nThe album includes one of the group's best-known songs: a cover of Neil Young's \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\". The cover quite differs from the original in that the original's mostly major chord progression is turned here into mostly minor, which emphasises a more melancholic feel. It is also arranged in 4/4 (as opposed to the original's waltz time), with a driving piano-bass-drum section. Andrew Weatherall later remixed the song to further emphasise the dub bassline; this remix was featured on both releases of the single and on the compilation \"Casino Classics\" (on American and European versions of the single, a Flowered Up remix is erroneously featured instead of the Andrew Weatherall mix). The follow-up single \"Kiss and Make Up\" is also a cover version of a (comparatively obscure) song written and originally recorded by The Field Mice. Ian Catt was the engineer/co-producer on both versions.\n\n\"Carnt Sleep\" is based on the \"Youthman riddim\", a backing track that reggae producer Glen Brown has used on dozens of records since the late nineteen-seventies. \"Wilson\" is based on a loop of the intro to Wilson Pickett's version of \"Hey Jude\" and spoken samples from a decimalisation training record. \"Nothing Can Stop Us\", one of the group's most famous singles, features a very prominent sample of Dusty Springfield's track, \"I Can't Wait Until I See My Baby's Face\" (from her 1967 album \"Where Am I Going?.\") Saint Etienne later recorded a version of \"Nothing Can Stop Us\" with vocals by Kylie Minogue.\n\nThe dialogue heard in the track \"Etienne Gonna Die\" is from the movie \"House of Games\".\n\nSaint Etienne members have named OMD's \"Dazzle Ships\" as a prominent influence on the album.\n\nThe young woman on the cover of \"Foxbase Alpha\", Celina Nash, was a member of the group Golden alongside Lucy Gillie and Candida Richardson; they released two singles (\"Anglo American/ Don't Destroy Me\" in 1992, and \"Wishful Thinking\", written by Jarvis Cocker, in 1993) on Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs's Icerink Records label. Nash also appears in Saint Etienne's 1993 album \"So Tough\"; she is the waitress who can be heard on \"Chicken Soup\". She is also in the video for the Pulp song \"Babies\".\n\nThe US version of the album, released in January 1992, adds two bonus tracks: a new version of \"Kiss and Make Up\", rerecorded with Cracknell, and a unique version of \"People Get Real\", which was released as a double 'A' side single with \"Join Our Club\" later the same year.\n\nThe album was re-released in May 2009 as part of the Universal Music Deluxe Edition re-issue program. The album has been remastered, and is accompanied by a second disc featuring B-sides, mixes and five previously unreleased tracks. The CD booklet features new sleeve notes by Jon Savage and Tom Ewing, images and memorabilia.\n\nAlso released was a boxed-set version, which was limited to 1000 copies. In addition to the two CDs this package also included a 6\" Subbuteo figure and a replica \"Foxbase Alpha\" poster, as well as a set of four badges.\n\nIn 2009, \"Foxbase Alpha\" was 're-produced' and remixed from the original multi-tracks by Richard X. This new version was called \"Foxbase Beta\", and formed the basis of much of what was played during the band's May 2009 tour, which saw \"Foxbase Alpha\" played live in its entirety for the first time. \"Foxbase Beta\" was packaged with an additional CD titled \"Foxbase Extra\", featuring a commentary on the album by Bob Stanley, Pete Wiggs and Richard X, and additional out-takes.

{"id": "2195817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195817", "title": "Contentious politics", "text": "Contentious politics\n\nContentious politics is the use of disruptive techniques to make a political point, or to change government policy. Examples of such techniques are actions that disturb the normal activities of society such as demonstrations, general strike action, riot, terrorism, civil disobedience, and even revolution or insurrection. Social movements often engage in contentious politics. The concept distinguishes these forms of contention from the everyday acts of resistance explored by James C. Scott, interstate warfare, and forms of contention employed entirely within institutional settings, such as elections or sports. Historical sociologist Charles Tilly defines contentious politics as \"interactions in which actors make claims bearing on someone else's interest, in which governments appear either as targets, initiators of claims, or third parties.\"\n\nContentious politics has existed forever, but its form varies over time and space. For example, Tilly argues that the nature of contentious politics changed fairly dramatically with the birth of social movements in 18th-century Europe. \n\nThe concept of contentious politics was developed throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century by its most prominent scholars in the United States: Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly, and Doug McAdam. Until its development, the study of contentious politics was divided among a number of traditions each of which were concerned with the description and explanation of different contentious political phenomena, especially the social movement, the strike, and revolution. One of the primary goals of these three authors was to advance the explanation of these phenomena and other contentious politics under a single research agenda. There remains a significant plurality of agendas in addition to the one these three propose.\n\n\n\n\n"}

MacLaine plays a fictional former First Lady protected by an entourage of Secret Service agents led by one she continually exasperates (Cage).\n\nThe film is set in Somersville, Ohio (played by Parkton, Maryland) and was nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1995 (Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy/Musical: Shirley MacLaine).\n\nDoug Chesnic is a Secret Service agent who takes great pride in his job, performing his duties with the utmost professionalism. His assignment for the last three years has been a severe test of his patience. Doug is in charge of a team stationed in Ohio to protect Tess Carlisle, the widow of a former U.S. President.\n\nTess is well known for her diplomatic and philanthropic work, but seems to regard Doug less as a security officer and more as a domestic servant—not unlike her chauffeur, Earl, or her nurse, Frederick.\n\nDoug regards it as beneath his professional dignity to perform little chores around the house or bring Tess her breakfast in bed. Tess orders him to do so, even to fetch her ball during a round of golf. When Doug defies her, Tess contacts a close friend - the current President of the United States – to express her displeasure. The annoyed President - under the impression Doug is substandard - chastises him by phone.\n\nDoug's assignment with Tess comes to an end, so he is eager to be given a more exciting and challenging assignment. Tess decides that she wants him to stay, and Doug's assignment is extended.\n\nThe bickering between Doug and Tess continues, even in the car. While alone with Earl, Tess orders him to drive off, stranding her bodyguards. A humiliated Doug must phone the local sheriff—not for the first time—to be on the lookout for her. He fires Earl when they return, but Tess countermands that decision.\n\nAfter returning from a hospital checkup, Tess watches old television footage of her husband's funeral, concentrating on a momentary glimpse of Doug among the mourners, overcome with grief. She makes an effort to get on his good side, sharing a drink and a late-night conversation. She explains that she is not close to her children, in part due to the awkward upbringing they had as political family. Morale for the agents improves when Tess tells them that the President will be visiting her late husband's presidential library, but his subsequent cancellation lowers her spirits.\n\nTess is kidnapped. While the FBI takes charge of the investigation, Doug and his security detail are informed that Mrs. Carlisle's recent dizzy spells are caused by an inoperable brain tumor. As the investigation begins without him, Doug finds evidence of Earl being involved. In Earl's hospital room, where the chauffeur was taken after claiming to be rendered unconscious by the abductors, Doug threatens to shoot off Earl's toes, one by one, until he confesses to an FBI agent where Mrs. Carlisle is being held. Doug goes so far as to shoot one toe. Earl admits that Mrs. Carlisle is being held captive by Earl's sister and her husband.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service raid the kidnappers' home and arrest them. When they find Mrs. Carlisle buried, but alive, beneath the floor of the farmhouse, Doug and his agents volunteer to do the digging. Tess then insists that her Secret Service detail accompany her to the hospital.\n\nUpon being released from the hospital, Tess refuses to obey the hospital rule that patients must be discharged in a wheelchair. Doug tells her, using her first name for the first time, \"Tess, get in the God damn chair.\" After a brief pause, Tess complies, pats Doug's hand and says, \"Very good, Douglas.\"\n\n\n\"Guarding Tess\" received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 57% rating based on 35 reviews. The \"Washington Post\" described it as derivative of other recent films \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989), \"The Bodyguard\" (1992), and \"In the Line of Fire\" (1993), and decries \"the melodramatic turnaround that sabotages the last section of the movie\", but describes \"the comic tension between MacLaine and Cage\" as being \"so well done, it doesn't matter how dumb things get\".\n\n"}

He had a humble family background, and was known for his courage and loyalty since he was young. He was recruited to serve as an Assistant Officer (從事) in the provincial office under Liu Zhang, the Governor of Yi Province.\n\nIn 212, the warlord Liu Bei launched a campaign to seize control of Yi Province from Liu Zhang. Liu Zhang ordered his officers Liu Gui (劉璝), Leng Bao (冷苞), Zhang Ren, Deng Xian (鄧賢) and others to lead troops to Fu (涪; in present-day Mianyang, Sichuan) to resist Liu Bei, but they were defeated and forced to retreat to Mianzhu (緜竹).\n\nZhang Ren and Liu Zhang's son, Liu Xun, moved to a garrison at Luo (雒; north of present-day Guanghan, Sichuan). When Liu Bei's forces showed up, Zhang Ren led his men to engage the enemy at Yan Bridge (鴈橋) but was defeated and captured alive. Liu Bei had heard of Zhang Ren's reputation for being brave and loyal so he asked Zhang to surrender. However, Zhang Ren replied sternly, \"I'll never serve two lords.\" He was then executed. Liu Bei felt it was a pity.\n\nZhang Ren's grave is located in Weigan Village (桅杆村), Beiwai District (北外鄉), Guanghan, Sichuan. During the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor in the Qing dynasty, the local government erected a tombstone for the grave with the words \"Tomb of the Han General Zhang Ren\" (漢將軍張公任之墓) inscribed on it. In 1954, a brick bearing the words \"Built in the 8th month of the 6th year of Yuankang\" was unearthed at the site of the tomb. The brick serves as evidence that the tomb was constructed in as early as 296 during the Yuankang era (291–300) of the reign of Emperor Hui in the Western Jin dynasty. In July 1990, the tomb became a Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the County Level under the Guanghan administration.\n\nZhang Ren appears in chapters 60–64 of the historical novel \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", which romanticises the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. Like his historical counterpart, Zhang Ren serves under Liu Zhang and is known for being very loyal to his lord. When Liu Bei first enters Yi Province in the name of helping Liu Zhang counter a rival warlord, Zhang Lu, Zhang Ren and others warn Liu Zhang to be wary of Liu Bei and take precautionary measures, but Liu Zhang ignores them. When Liu Zhang attends a banquet hosted by Liu Bei, Liu Bei's strategist Pang Tong instructs the general Wei Yan to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to assassinate Liu Zhang. Zhang Ren senses danger so he draws his sword and pretends to join the sword dance while secretly protecting Liu Zhang from Wei Yan's advances. When war breaks out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang, Zhang Ren sets up an ambush at the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix, where his archers kill Pang Tong. After Zhang Ren is captured alive, Liu Bei asks him to surrender but he firmly refuses and is executed. Liu Bei feels it was a pity so he has Zhang Ren buried with full honours.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195870", "title": "Ouranosaurus", "text": "Ouranosaurus\n\nOuranosaurus is a genus of herbivorous iguanodont dinosaur that lived during the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous of modern-day Niger. \"Ouranosaurus\" measured about long. Two rather complete fossils were found in the Elrhaz Formation, Gadoufaoua deposits, Agadez, Niger, in 1965 and 1970. The animal was named in 1976 by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet; the type species being Ouranosaurus nigeriensis. The name is a combination of the Arabic word for \"courage\" and the country of discovery, although \"ourane\" is also the Tuareg name for the desert monitor.\n\nFive French palaeontological expeditions were undertaken in the Gadoufaoua region of the Sahara Desert in Niger between 1965 and 1972 and led by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet. These deposits come from GAD 5, a layer in the upper Elrhaz Formation of the Tégama Group, which was deposited during the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous. On the first expedition, lasting from January–February 1965, eight iguanodontian specimens were discovered at the \"niveau des Innocents\" site, east of the Emechedoui wells. An additional two skeletons were discovered southeast of Elrhaz in the \"Camp des deux Arbres\" locality, which were given the field numbers GDF 300 and GDI 381. Both were collected in the February–April 1996 expedition, the former including a nearly complete but scattered skeleton, and the latter a skeleton what was two-thirds preserved. The skeletons then in 1967 were brought to the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle of Paris, where they were prepared. GDF 381 was recategorized with the number MNHN GDF 1700 and then later described in 1999 as the holotype of the new taxon \"Lurdusaurus arenatus\". While the third expedition did not turn up additional iguanodontian material, the fourth in January–March 1970 uncovered a nearly complete and partially articulated skeleton lacking the skull, south of the \"niveau des Innocents\" site, and was also given the field number GDF 381. This specimen was collected and taken to the MNHN by the fifth expedition in 1972. Following a subsequent Italian-French expedition led by Taquet and Italian palaeontologist Giancarlo Ligabue that turned up a potential additional iguanodontian specimen, Ligabue offered to donate the nearly complete specimen and a skull of \"Sarcosuchus\" to the Municipality of Venice, which accepted the offer and subsequently mounted the skeleton in 1975 at the Museo di Storia Naturale di Venezia.\n\nTaquet formally described the two mostly-complete specimens MNHN GDF 300 and MNHN GDF 381 from the first and fourth expeditions as \"Ouranosaurus nigeriensis\" in 1976, along with a referred coracoid and femur that bore the numbers MNHN GDF 301 and MNHN GDF 302 respectively. MNHN GDF 300 was made the holotype, and was the primary specimen described, including a semi-articulated skull lacking the left , right and the , almost the entire vertebral column, forelimbs lacking a few hand bones, and most of the right hindlimb and a few bones of the left. Additional description for bones unpreserved in the holotype was based on Taquet's MNHN GDF 381, which was not mentioned as having been sent to Venice and renumbered as MSNVE 3714, although this was confirmed by Belgian palaeontologist Filippo Bertozzo and colleagues in 2017. The holotype itself was returned to Niger after being described and having its bones casted and mounted, and is now on display at the Musée National Boubou Hama in Niamey. The generic name \"Ouranosaurus\" carries a double meaning, it is both taken from Arabic meaning \"valour\", \"courage\" or \"recklessness\" and also from the local Tuareg language of Niger where is it the name they call the desert monitor. The specific name refers to Niger, the country of discovery. Taquet had used the name \"Ouranosaurus nigeriensis\" previously, first in a public presentation of the skeleton MNHN GDF 300 in July 1972, then later in September 1972 in a news article and again in December 1972 in a book; only the book bore any images associated with the name, and none of the earlier mentions had a diagnosis to make the name valid.\n\n\"Ouranosaurus\" was a relatively large iguanodontian, estimated by Taquet in 1976 to have a body length of and a weight of . A lighter weight of was suggested by American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul in 2010 due to the although a longer length of was given. The holotype and paratype specimens were suggested to belong to subadults by Bertozzo \"et al.\" in 2017, although they would have been close to adult size. MSNVE 3714 is long as mounted, although a few caudals are missing, and is roughly 90% the length of the holotype, which would be long. The variation between the sizes fits within the range of variation between adult individuals of \"Iguanodon\", so there is a chance that the larger holotype and smaller paratype were same ontogenetic stage.\n\nThe skull of \"Ouranosaurus\" is long. It was rather low, being wide and only tall. The top of the skull was flat, the highest point being just in front of the orbits and sloping down towards both the read of the skull and the tip of the snout. This makes \"Ouranosaurus\" have the most elongate skull of any non-hadrosaurid, the length being 3.8 times the maximum height, although the skull is proportionally wider than related \"Mantellisaurus\".\n\nBones of the snout are more loosely articulated with each other than the bones of the posterior skull. The are long, with very deep as in other iguanodontians. Anteriorly, the premaxillae flare gently laterally into a rugose surface for a beak, like other iguanodontians, although dissimilar from \"Iguanodon\" and similar to hadrosaurids the nares are entirely visible from above. Neither premaxilla bears any teeth, although the very anterior tip has \"pseudo-teeth\" formed by multiple denticles on the margin of the bone. Only the right maxilla of \"Ouranosaurus\" is known. although it is well preserved forming a triangle long and tall, much taller proportionally than \"Iguanodon\". The maxilla bears faces for articulation with the premaxilla in front, above, , , and possibly internally, and to the rear. The lacrimal process is the highest point of the maxilla, and behind this process is a smooth and curved margin for the , which is bounded by the maxilla in front and below, lacrimal above, and jugal behind. The jugal overlaps only the posterior end of the maxilla, which is unlike hadrosaurids where there is more overlap. The dental edge of the maxilla is slightly arced, and above the toothrow is a shallow depression bearing , also known as the buccal emargination that is diagnostic of Ornithischia. 20 teeth are preserved in the maxilla, although the anterior end of the toothrow is broken and Taquet (1976) predicted the total number to be 22.\n\nMany of the central bones of the skull are the same form as those of hadrosaurids or related iguanodontians like \"Iguanodon\" and \"Mantellisaurus\". The jugal below and behind the orbit bears the same shape as in hadrosaurids, with a high rear process, and articulated with the quadratojugal and quadrate that are also very similar to more derived taxa. As in other ornithopods, the is a tri-radiate bone surrounding sides of the orbit, and . Contact between the postorbital and the excludes the flattened and wide from the supratemporal fenestra. In \"Ouranosaurus\" and related taxa the are small, and articulates with the broadened and textured lacrimal. Only a single was present in \"Ouranosaurus\", which projects into the orbit above the eye. The of \"Ouranosaurus\" are unique among ornithischians. The bones are unfused suggesting mobility, and at their ends on the top of the skull are rounded domes, which were described by Taquet (1976) as distinct and rugose \"nasal protuberances\".\n\nThe snout was toothless and covered in a horny sheath during life, forming a very wide beak together with a comparable sheath on the short predentary bone at the extreme front of the lower jaws. However, after a rather large diastema with the beak, there were large batteries of cheek teeth on the sides of the jaws: the gaps between the teeth crowns were filled by the points of a second generation of replacement teeth, the whole forming a continuous surface. Contrary to the situation with some related species, a third generation of erupted teeth was lacking. There were twenty-two tooth positions in both lower and upper jaw, for a total of eighty-eight.\n\nThe most conspicuous feature of \"Ouranosaurus\" is a large \"sail\" on its back, supported by long, wide, neural spines, that spanned its entire rump and tail, resembling that of \"Spinosaurus\", a well-known meat-eating dinosaur also known from northern Africa. These tall neural spines did not closely resemble those of sail-backs such as \"Dimetrodon\" of the Permian Period. The supporting spines in a sailback become thinner distally, whereas in \"Ouranosaurus\" the spines actually become thicker distally and flatten. The posterior spines were also bound together by ossified tendons, which stiffened the back. Finally, the spine length peaks over the forelimbs.\n\nThe first four dorsal vertebrae are unknown; the fifth already bears a that is pointed and slightly hooked; Taquet presumed it might have anchored a tendon to support the neck or skull. The tenth, eleventh and twelfth spines are the longest, at about . The last dorsal spine, the seventeenth, has a grooved posterior edge, in which the anterior corner of the lower spine of the first sacral vertebra is locked. The spines over the six sacral vertebrae are markedly lower, but those of the tail base again longer; towards the end of the tail the spines gradually shorten.\nThe dorsal \"sail\" is usually explained as either functioning as a system for thermoregulation or a display structure. An alternative hypothesis is that the back might have carried a hump consisting of muscle tissue or fat, resembling that of a bison or camel, rather than a sail. It could have been used for energy storage to survive a lean season.\n\nThe axial column consisted of eleven neck vertebrae, seventeen dorsal vertebrae, six sacral vertebrae and forty tail vertebrae. The tail was relatively short.\n\nThe front limbs were rather long with 55% of the length of the hind limbs. A quadrupedal stance would have been possible. The humerus was very straight. The hand was lightly built, short and broad. On each hand \"Ouranosaurus\" bore a thumb claw or spike that was much smaller than that of the earlier \"Iguanodon\". The second and third digits were broad and hoof-like, and anatomically were good for walking. To support the walking hypothesis, the wrist was large and its component bones fused together to prevent its dislocation. The last digit (number 5) was long. In related species the fifth finger is presumed to have been prehensile: used for picking food like leaves and twigs or to help lower the food by lowering branch to a manageable height. Taquet assumed that with \"Ouranosaurus\" this function had been lost because the fifth metacarpal, reduced to a spur, could no longer be directed sideways.\n\nThe hindlimbs were large and robust to accommodate the weight of the body and strong enough to allow a bipedal walk. The femur was slightly longer than the tibia. This may indicate that the legs were used as pillars, and not for sprinting. Taquet concluded that \"Ouranosaurus\" was not a good runner because the fourth trochanter, the attachment point for the large retractor muscles connected to the tail base, was weakly developed. The foot was narrow with only three toes and relatively long.\n\nIn the pelvis, the prepubis was very large, rounded and directed obliquely upwards.\n\nTaquet originally assigned \"Ouranosaurus\" to the Iguanodontidae, within the larger Iguanodontia. However, although it shares some similarities with \"Iguanodon\" (such as a thumb spike), \"Ouranosaurus\" is no longer usually placed in the iguanodontid family, a grouping that is now generally considered paraphyletic, a series of subsequent offshoots from the main stem-line of iguandontian evolution. It is instead placed in the clade Hadrosauriformes, closely related to the Hadrosauroidea, which contains the Hadrosauridae (also known as \"duck-billed dinosaurs\") and their closest relatives. \"Ouranosaurus\" appears to represent an early specialized branch in this group, showing in some traits independent convergence with the hadrosaurids. It is thus a basal hadrosauriform.\n\nThe simplified cladogram below follows an analysis by Andrew McDonald and colleagues, published in November 2010 with information from McDonald, 2011.\n\nThe jaws were apparently operated by relatively weak muscles. \"Ouranosaurus\" had only small temporal openings behind the eyes, from which the larger capiti-mandibularis muscle was attached to the coronoid process on the lower jaw bone. Small rounded horns in front of its eyes made \"Ouranosaurus\" the only known horned ornithopod. The back of the skull was rather narrow and could not compensate for the lack of a greater area of attachment for the jaw muscle, that the openings normally would provide, allowing for more power and a stronger bite. A lesser muscle, the musculus depressor mandibulae, used to open the lower jaws, was located at the back of the skull and was connected to a strongly projecting, broad and anteriorly oblique processus paroccipitalis. \"Ouranosaurus\" probably used its teeth to chew up tough plant food. A diet has been suggested of leaves, fruit, and seeds as the chewing would allow to free more energy from high quality food; the wide beak on the other hand indicates a specialisation in eating large amounts of low quality fodder. \"Ouranosaurus\" lived in a river delta.\n\n\"Ouranosaurus\" bears more similarities to other derived iguanodonts than more basal ornithopods. Remodeling is present in the subadult paratype, and high vascular density and circumferential arrangement of the microstructure suggests fast growth. Faster growth occurs in the same phylogenetic groups as higher body size, although their relationship is unclear. \"Ouranosaurus\" is a similar size to more basal \"Tenontosaurus\" which has slow growth, so either faster growth is caused by body size or \"Tenontosaurus\" is the maximum size of an ornithopod with a slow growth rate. \n\n\"Ouranosaurus\" is known from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located in Niger. Only two mostly complete skeletons and up to 3 additional individuals have been found. The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. \"Ouranosaurus\" is from the upper portion of the formation, probably Aptian in age. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone).\n\nAfter the iguanodontian \"Lurdusaurus\", \"Nigersaurus\" was the most numerous megaherbivore. Other herbivores from the same formation include \"Ouranosaurus\", \"Elrhazosaurus\", and an unnamed titanosaur. It also lived alongside the theropods \"Kryptops\", \"Suchomimus\", and \"Eocarcharia\", and a yet-unnamed noasaurid. Crocodylomorphs like \"Sarcosuchus\", \"Anatosuchus\", \"Araripesuchus\", and \"Stolokrosuchus\" also lived there. In addition, remains of a pterosaur, chelonians, fish, a hybodont shark, and freshwater bivalves have been found. Grass did not evolve until the late Cretaceous.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2195909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195909", "title": "Actor model and process calculi", "text": "Actor model and process calculi\n\nIn computer science, the Actor model and process calculi are two closely related approaches to the modelling of concurrent digital computation. See Actor model and process calculi history.\n\nThere are many similarities between the two approaches, but also several differences (some philosophical, some technical):\n\nThe publications on the Actor model and on process calculi have a fair number of cross-references, acknowledgments, and reciprocal citations (see Actor model and process calculi history).\n\nIndirect communication using channels (\"e.g.\" Gilles Kahn and David MacQueen [1977]) has been an important issue for communication in parallel and concurrent computation affecting both semantics and performance. Some process calculi differ from the Actor model in their use of channels as opposed to direct communication.\n\nSynchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel must wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel before the sender can proceed.\n\nA synchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives codice_1 and codice_2 communications. The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple synchronous channel:\n\nHowever, simple synchronous channels do not suffice for process calculi such as Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) [Hoare 1978 and 1985] because use of the \"guarded choice\" (after Dijkstra) command (called the \"alternative\" command in CSP). In a guarded choice command multiple offers (called guards) can be made concurrently on multiple channels to codice_1 and codice_2 messages; however at most one of the guards can be chosen for each execution of the guarded choice command. Because only one guard can be chosen, a guarded choice command in general effectively requires a kind of two-phase commit protocol or perhaps even a three-phase commit protocol if time-outs are allowed in guards (as in Occam 3 [1992]).\n\nConsider the following program written in CSP [Hoare 1978]:\nAccording to Clinger [1981], this program illustrates global nondeterminism, since the nondeterminism arises from incomplete specification of the timing of signals between the three processes codice_8, codice_9, and codice_10. The repetitive guarded command in the definition of codice_10 has two alternatives: \nIf codice_10 ever accepts the codice_12 message from codice_8, then codice_8 terminates. Accepting the codice_12 causes codice_9 to be sent false which when input as the value of its guard will cause codice_9 to terminate. When both codice_8 and codice_9 have terminated, codice_10 terminates because it no longer has live processes providing input.\n\nIn the above program, there are synchronous channels from codice_8 to codice_10, codice_9 to codice_10, and codice_10 to codice_9.\n\nAccording to Knabe [1992], Chandy and Misra [1988] characterized this as analogous to the committee coordination problem:\n\nThis section presents a simple distributed protocol for channels in synchronous process calculi. The protocol has some problems that are addressed in the sections below.\n\nThe behavior of a guarded choice command is as follows:\n\nThe behavior of a guard is as follows:\n\nThe behavior of a channel is as follows:\n\nAgain consider the program written in CSP (discussed in Synchronous channels in process calculi above):\n\nAs pointed out in Knabe [1992], a problem with the above protocol (A simple distributed protocol) is that the process codice_10 might never accept the codice_12 message from codice_8 (a phenomenon called starvation) and consequently the above program might never print anything.\n\nIn contrast consider, a simple Actor system that consists of Actors X, Y, Z, and print where\n\n\nBy the laws of Actor semantics, the above Actor system will always halt when the Actors X, Y, are Z are each sent a codice_90 message resulting in sending print a number that can be unbounded large.\n\nThe difference between the CSP program and the Actor system is that the Actor Z does not get messages using a guarded choice command from multiple channels. Instead it processes messages in arrival ordering, and by the laws for Actor systems, the codice_12 message is guaranteed to arrive.\n\nConsider the following program written in CSP [Hoare 1978]:\n\nAs pointed out in Knabe [1992], an issue with the above protocol (A simple distributed protocol) is that the process codice_104 might never accept a bid from codice_105 or codice_106 (a phenomenon called livelock) and consequently codice_107 might never be sent anything. In each attempt to accept a message, codice_104 is thwarted because the bid that was offered by codice_109 or codice_110 is snatched away by codice_111 because it turns out that codice_111 has much faster access than codice_104 to codice_109 and codice_110. Consequently, codice_111 can accept a bid, process it and accept another bid before codice_104 can commit to accepting a bid.\n\nAs pointed out in Knabe [1992], an issue with the above protocol (A simple distributed protocol) is the large number of communications that must be sent in order to perform the handshaking in order to send a message through a synchronous channel. Indeed, as shown in the previous section (Livelock), the number of communications can be unbounded.\n\nThe subsections above have articulated the following three issues concerned with the use of synchronous channels for process calculi:\n\nIt is notable that in all of the above, issues arise from the use of a guarded choice command to get messages from multiple channels.\n\nAsynchronous channels have the property that a sender putting a message in the channel need not wait for a receiver to get the message out of the channel.\n\nAn asynchronous channel can be modeled by an Actor that receives codice_1 and codice_2 communications. The following is the behavior of an Actor for a simple asynchronous channel:\n\nThe Join-calculus programming language (published in 1996) implemented local and distributed concurrent computations. It incorporated asynchronous channels as well as a kind of synchronous channel that is used for procedure calls. Agha's Aπ Actor calculus is based on a typed version of the asynchronous π-calculus.\n\nThe use of algebraic techniques was pioneered in the process calculi. Subsequently, several different process calculi intended to provide algebraic reasoning about Actor systems have been developed in , , \n\nWill Clinger (building on the work of Irene Greif [1975], Gordon Plotkin [1976], Henry Baker [1978], Michael Smyth [1978], and Francez, Hoare, Lehmann, and de Roever [1979]) published the first satisfactory mathematical denotational theory of the Actor model using domain theory in his dissertation in 1981. His semantics contrasted the unbounded nondeterminism of the Actor model with the bounded nondeterminism of CSP [Hoare 1978] and Concurrent Processes [Milne and Milner 1979] (see denotational semantics). Roscoe [2005] has developed a denotational semantics with unbounded nondeterminism for a subsequent version of Communicating Sequential Processes Hoare [1985]. More recently Carl Hewitt [2006b] developed a denotational semantics for Actors based on timed diagrams.\n\nUgo Montanari and Carolyn Talcott [1998] have contributed to attempting to reconcile Actors with process calculi.\n\n"}

Jocko), was an early Canadian fur trader, scout, and explorer associated with the North West Company. He built Spokane House and Kootanae House, two key fur-trading posts of the era, and helped David Thompson cross the Continental Divide and discover the Columbia River.\n\nFinlay was born in 1768 on the south bank of the Saskatchewan River. His mother came from the Chippewa tribe of Native Americans, but never married his father, James Finlay, a North West Company trader who had a family in Montreal.\n\nFinlay was recorded as a clerk of the North West Company as early as 1799; this was the highest office accorded to \"half-breeds\" in that era. Finlay was compensated, however, as much as David Thompson, the English-born explorer, probably reflecting his reputation as a scout.\n\nThompson accordingly engaged Finlay in 1806 to blaze a trail through the Rocky Mountains across the Continental Divide; Thompson followed in 1807, though he was markedly unhappy with the quality of the trail, which led at least as far as Howse Pass. Finlay also played a key advance role in Thompson's discovery (from the East) of the Columbia River, scouting, storing provisions, and building canoes.\n\nAfter Thompson returned east, Finlay found work with the Pacific Fur Company (a surviving receipt shows him to have been literate). He later returned to the employ of the North West Company when the latter purchased the assets of the former during the War of 1812, and remained an employee until 1816, along with three of his sons. He later took over a defunct Hudson's Bay Company post, where botanist David Douglas recorded a visit in 1826, as well as a recipe for bread made from local lichens.\nHe died in 1828, and was buried on the grounds of Spokane House. According to Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, who passed by the abandoned site in 1833, all the buildings had been burned for firewood but one, which was maintained out of respect for a dead clerk buried beneath it.

Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. Scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is also known for its snacks like Bikaneri bhujia, mirchi bada and pyaaj kachori.

Originating for the Marwar region of the state is the concept Marwari Bhojnalaya, or vegetarian restaurants, today found in many part of India, which offer vegetarian food of the Marwari people. The history also has its effect on the diet as the Rajputs preferred majorly a non-vegetarian diet while the Jains, Maheshwari, Vaishnavas, and other preferred a vegetarian diet. So, the state has a myriad of both types of delicacies.\n\nAccording to a 2014 survey released by the registrar general of India, Rajasthan has 74.9% vegetarians, which makes it the most vegetarian state in India.\n\nRajasthani cuisine is also influenced by the Rajputs, who are predominantly non-vegetarians.

W. Bush, and his wife, First Lady Barbara Bush. After she was born in California, her family soon relocated to Texas, where Robin lived most of her life.\n\nAt the age of 3, Robin was diagnosed with advanced leukemia. As she was given very little time to live, her parents flew her to New York City for treatment, where she spent the next six months. Despite doctors' efforts, she died two months before her fourth birthday. Her death prompted them to establish a foundation for leukemia research.\n\nThen an oil field equipment salesman for Dresser Industries, George H. W. Bush lived in various places around the United States with his wife, Barbara (née Pierce), and their young son, George W. In 1949, they moved to Compton, California; by then, Barbara was pregnant with the couple's second child. On September 23, 1949, Pauline Robinson Pierce, Barbara's mother, was killed in a car accident, which also injured her father, Marvin. Since she was very late into the pregnancy, Marvin advised Barbara not to make the journey to New York, so as not to hurt the baby.\n\nOn December 20, 1949, Barbara delivered a baby girl, whom she named Pauline Robinson Bush, after her late mother. Initially, the child's intended name was Pauline Pierce Bush, until George H. W.'s mother pointed out that her initials would be P. P. Bush, which \"would never do\". From birth, the little girl was referred to as Robin, so much so that, later in life, Barbara would comment that Robin's siblings probably do not even remember her real name.\n\nRobin was described as being calm and having a \"sweet soul\". She was \"quiet and gentle, and she had lovely little blond curls.\" Her father would later say of Robin: \"She'd fight and cry and play and make her way just like the rest, but there was about her a certain softness... Her peace made me feel strong, and so very important.\"\nIn 1950, shortly after Robin's birth, the family relocated again, this time to Midland, Texas; the family quickly became involved in their new town. In February 1953, after having moved to their third house in Midland, the Bushes had another child, John Ellis, nicknamed \"Jeb\".\n\nIn the spring of 1953, shortly after Jeb's birth, Robin awoke one morning, listless. She said she was unsure of what to do that particular morning, stating that she \"may go out and lie on the grass and watch the cars go by\", or just stay in bed. Barbara believed Robin had come down with what her mother had referred to as \"spring fever\", as, up until that point, she had been \"as rowdy and healthy\" as her brothers. The child was taken to the family's pediatrician, Dorothy Wyvell, who took a blood sample and told Barbara to return later that afternoon with George H. W.; Barbara had not yet noticed the bruises on Robin. Dr. Wyvell told George and Barbara that Robin had advanced stage leukemia. Her advice for them was to not tell anyone about the child's illness, and to take her home, \"make life as easy as possible for her, and in three weeks' time, she'll be gone.\" Neither parent had ever heard of leukemia, and, in the 1950s, not much was known of it; consequently, it was nearly always fatal.\nThe Bushes went against both parts of the doctor's advice. Almost immediately, their friends from the country club were discussing Robin's diagnosis, and George called his uncle, John M. Walker, president of Memorial Hospital in New York City. Walker urged them to take Robin to the adjacent Sloan Kettering Institute. He told George and Barbara that \"you could never live with yourselves unless you treat her.\" The very next day, leaving George W. and Jeb with different friends, they both flew to New York and had Robin admitted into Sloan Kettering. She was tested once again, and, after the diagnosis was confirmed, she was immediately put on medication. George W. was told that his sister was sick, but was never explained exactly how bad her condition was. For the next six months, Barbara largely remained in New York with Robin, while George traveled back and forth, due to his job. Their two sons were cared for either by family friends or by housekeepers.\n\nRobin was, by her mother's account, \"wonderful\", not questioning why she was sick. She disliked bone marrow tests, which were very painful, as were many of the blood transfusions she endured. At times, the medication was so effective that Robin did not even appear to be ill. However, she never went into complete remission. According to Charlotte Tan, who treated Robin in New York, she was mature and tolerated her treatments well. Barbara and George heard about a doctor in Kansas City who maintained he had found the cure for leukemia. However, their hopes were dashed when they found out the man was merely testing a new drug, and had not claimed to have the cure. Sometimes, her parents would take Robin to the Bush house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and she was once taken to Maine for a brief period. There, she got to see her brothers, whose pictures she had taped to the headboard of her hospital bed. During this visit, George W. was not allowed to wrestle with his sister like they used to; his mother focused most of her attention on Robin and would \"snap\" at him if he tried to \"horse around\" with his sister.\n\nBy fall, Robin's condition was worsening. She spent time in an oxygen tent, and her platelets were low enough that whenever she started bleeding, it was very difficult to ascertain when it would stop. Barbara allowed no crying around Robin, and made her husband leave the room if he felt like doing so. Prescott Bush, George's father, had purchased a plot for Robin to be buried in, as her situation was not improving. Eventually, due to her medication, Robin developed heavy bruising, which almost entirely covered one of her legs, and \"a hundred or so\" stomach ulcers. Barbara called George, and, by the time he arrived to his daughter's bedside, she had entered a coma. Robin died on October 11, 1953, after doctors' efforts to close the ulcers in her stomach. She was two months short of her fourth birthday. Two days later, on October 13, a memorial service was held for Robin, at the Bushes' home in Greenwich. Initially, her body was donated for research, in hopes that her death might help others survive. Several days later, when the hospital released her remains, Dorothy Walker Bush, her paternal grandmother, was among those who buried her. In 2000, her grave was exhumed and her remains were relocated and reburied at the George H.W. Bush Library.\n\nAfter Robin's death, Barbara cried herself to sleep many nights. She stated that she \"crumbled\" completely, and would later say that she \"fell totally apart and [George] took care of [her].\" George W. was told of his sister's death a few days after it happened, when his parents picked him up from school. He would later describe this as the only low point of his happy childhood, remembering the sadness he felt both for his parents and for the loss of his sister. He and his brother Jeb then became their mother's focal points, and she devoted her time to caring for them, as a means of overcoming her daughter's death.\n\nAfter overhearing George W. tell one of his friends that he could not go out and play, as he needed to play with his mother, Barbara decided that it was time to heal, for her family. After a few months, \"the grief and the awful aching hurt began to disappear.\" \"I like... to think of Robin as though she were a part, a living part, of our vital energetic and wonderful family of men and [Barbara],\" George H. W. Bush would later write. Barbara came to believe that she and her husband valued all people more because of the loss they suffered with Robin. Barbara also attributed the premature graying of her hair to Robin's extended illness and death.\n\nDorothy Walker Bush commissioned an oil painting of Robin, which hung in the Bushes' homes in Midland and, later, Houston. Eventually, Barbara and George H. W. had three more children: Neil, in 1955, Marvin in 1956, and another daughter, Dorothy, known as \"Doro\" and born in 1959. Doro was once described by her father as \"a wild dark version of Robin\", noting that the two looked so much alike, his parents mistakenly called her Robin once. In 2000, Robin's remains were transferred from Connecticut to the family's future burial plot at the George Bush Presidential Library in Texas. On this occasion, George H. W. stated: \"It seems funny after almost 50 years since her death how dear Robin is to our hearts.\"\n\nFollowing Robin's death, the Bush family created a charity to raise awareness and money for leukemia research called the Bright Star Foundation.\nThe impact of the Bright Star Foundation was acknowledged by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2004, when it opened the Robin Bush Child and Adolescent Clinic. Barbara later became honorary chairwoman of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and honorary national chairperson of Donor Awareness Week.\n\nFollowing Barbara's death in April 2018, a cartoon by Marshall Ramsey, of \"The Clarion-Ledger\", was widely circulated, showing Robin greeting Barbara upon the latter's entry to heaven. The cartoon was shared by various people and relatives of the family, including George W.'s daughter, Jenna Bush Hager. Following her father's death in November of that same year, Robin would be featured again in another Ramsey cartoon, where she and Barbara greeted George H. W. after the latter landing a TBM \"Avenger\" (the type of airplane he flew in the Navy during World War II) in heaven.\n\n"}

He was the son and successor of Šamši-Adad IV, and he ruled for 19 years during a troubled period of Assyrian history, marked by famine and war with nomads from the deserts to the west. He is best known for his penitential prayer to Ištar of Nineveh.\n\nAccording to a royal hymn composed in his honor, he was born “in the mountains that nobody knows,” suggesting he may have been born in exile, or perhaps a literary device, as it continues: “I was without understanding and I prayed not of your majesty.” It relates that, when Ištar appointed him to the kingship, he had restored her overthrown cult. Known from a single copy from the library of Ashurbanipal, it includes a plea to the goddess to restore him to health from the sickness that afflicted him, citing his temple-restoration, and devotions, to persuade her. It addresses Ištar of Nineveh, and Ištar of Arbil, as though they were separate deities. A second, fragmentary literary prayer thanks her for her favor.\n\nA single short brick-inscription comes from his palace in Assur, which was located between the south-west front of the ziggurat and the Anu-Adad temple. The \"White Obelisk\" is sometimes attributed to him by historians, but more usually to his later namesake, Aššur-nāṣir-apli II, because its internal content (hunting, military campaigns, etc.) better matches what is known about his reign. The \"Synchronistic Kinglist\" gives his Babylonian counterpart as Kaššu-nādin-aḫi (c. 1006–1004 BC), but probably only for stylistic purposes as there seems to have been no recorded contact between the kingdoms during this period.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son, Šalmanu-ašaredu II, who mentions him in one of his own inscriptions and later by another son, the long-reigning Aššur-rabi II.\n\n"}

The club's official colours were black and yellow.\n\nThe club was founded on 4 September 1894, which makes it one of the oldest professional Dutch football clubs. The club's first name was \"Look-Out\", which was changed to \"Prinses Juliana Veendam\" (Princess Juliana Veendam) in 1909, which soon became simply \"Veendam\". Veendam became professional in 1954, when the Dutch professional league was introduced. The professional branch of the club left the club in 1974, to form Sportclub Veendam. The amateur branch became Veendam 1894.

{"id": "2195977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2195977", "title": "Public intoxication", "text": "Public intoxication\n\nPublic intoxication, also known as \"drunk and disorderly\" and drunk in public, is a summary offense in some countries rated to public cases or displays of drunkenness. Public intoxication laws vary widely from jurisdiction, but usually require some obvious display of intoxicated incompetence or behavior disruptive/obnoxious to public order before the charge is levied.\n\nVictoria and Queensland are the only states in Australia that still have a specific offence of public drunkenness, a charge that a royal commission found disproportionately affected Aboriginal people. On 22 August 2019, Victoria announced plans to decriminalise public drunkenness and to treat alcohol abuse as a health issue. Police even in these states are relatively lenient about public intoxication, and generally transport an intoxicated person to his or her residence or temporary detention at a police station or other welfare establishment until the person is sober. Prosecution (charging) is generally only considered if the person is violent or other offenses have been committed.\n\nIn Victoria being \"drunk in a public place\" and \"drunk and disorderly in a public place\" are separate offences contained in the \"Summary Offences Act 1966\" which have their own power of arrest. Recent changes to legislation allow police to issue an infringement notice for these offences in addition to the traditional method of charging and bailing the offender to the Magistrates' Court. The current fine attached to the infringement notice is $590 for a first offence and $1,100 for a subsequent offence. A person arrested for being drunk or drunk and disorderly is held at the Melbourne Custody Centre or the cells at a police station or placed in the care of a friend or relative. \n\nPublic drunkenness was decriminalised in New South Wales (1979), and the Northern Territory, and in South Australia (1984). In New South Wales police have the discretion to issue \"on the spot\" fines or infringement notices for \"drunk in public\", a fine that costs the individual over $480 (4 penalty units). Community Legal Centres across the state complain about these fines and the impact it has had on various vulnerable members of the community, including young people, the homeless and minority groups. As an example, a \"drunk and disorderly\" fine in New South Wales starts at $550. As of February 2009, local councils in New South Wales are not allowed to charge people who drink in alcohol-free zones; they are only permitted to confiscate the alcohol of the intoxicated person.\n\nIn Canada, liquor laws are made by the provinces and not the federal government.\n\nIn British Columbia, drinking in public and public intoxication are offenses. If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit.\n\nIn Ontario, drinking in public and public intoxication are offenses. Having an open container in public garners a $125 fine. Public drunkenness garners a $65 fine and detainment until sober. If an event is to take place in public with alcohol it must have a permit.\n\nWhile liquor laws are similar from province to province, the laws in the territories tend to be substantially different. For instance, in the Northwest Territories public intoxication can result in imprisonment or detention in a medical facility for up to 24 hours (NWT Liquor Act).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are a number of offences dealing with intoxication, which vary between the constituent countries.\n\nIn a public place, it is an offence to be:\n\nIt is also an offence to be drunk:\n\nThe police will only get involved if the person is so drunk they are unable to act in a reasonable manner, such as passing out on the street. In that case typically the police will, depending on the circumstances, help the intoxicated person on their way or place the person in a police station cell until sober. Once fit to be dealt with the detained person will normally either be cautioned, be issued with a Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND – £90 fine in ticket form) or bailed to appear at the local court. The court in turn may issue a fine (up to level 1 or level 3 on the standard scale depending on the offence charged).\n\nThere are also many more specific offences, including driving a motor vehicle while drunk (or being found 'drunk in charge') and riding a cycle while unfit through drink. Furthermore, the police have the power (although not the obligation) to confiscate any alcohol which is being consumed in public by those under 18, and local authorities have the power to prohibit alcohol consumption in certain areas.\n\nIn New Zealand, drinking in public is not a crime and instead, local governments must specify that alcohol is banned in an area before it is considered a crime to drink in that location. Being drunk in public is not specifically an offense unless the person who is intoxicated is a public nuisance, in which case they may be dealt with for 'disturbing the peace'. This will usually result in being taken home, or otherwise taken to a police cell until sober.\n\nLaws in the United States regarding drunkenness vary widely from state to state.\n\nIn 1968, in the case of \"Powell v. Texas\", the Texas law against public intoxication was challenged in the Supreme Court of the United States for alleged violation of Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment. The court upheld the law, ruling that criminalizing public intoxication was neither cruel nor unusual.\n\n\n"}

She was the youngest surviving daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach.\n\nPrincess Louise was born as the fifth daughter and youngest child of the then Prince and Princess of Wales, on 7 December 1724, at Leicester House, London. She was baptised \"Louisa\" there on 22 December. Her godparents were her elder sister and two cousins: Princess Amelia of Great Britain, Princess Louisa Ulrika of Prussia (for whom Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox, stood proxy), and Frederick, Prince Royal of Prussia, later Frederick the Great (for whom Henry de Nassau d'Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham, stood proxy).\n\nOn 11 June 1727, when Louise was two years old, her grandfather, George I, died, and her father ascended the throne as George II. On 30 August, as a child of the sovereign, Louise was granted use of the arms of the realm, differenced by a \"label argent of three points, each bearing torteaux gules\".\n\nIn a dynastic marriage, Louise wed Prince Frederick of Denmark and Norway on 11 December 1743 in Copenhagen. A first ceremony was conducted on 10 November 1743 in Hanover with her brother, the Duke of Cumberland, as the representative of the groom. After this, the entourages of Louise and Frederick met at Altona, Holstein, where Louise exchanged her English retinue for a Danish one, headed by her new chamberlain Carl Juel and her head lady-in-waiting Christiane Henriette Louise Juel. Louise and Frederick then traveled together to Copenhagen, where they held their official entry into the capital, followed by a second ceremony with the groom present.\n\nThe marriage was proposed by Great Britain. At the time of the marriage, both France and Great Britain wished to make an alliance with Denmark, and Great Britain had the advantage of being able to make a marriage alliance. Frederick's father, King Christian VI, hoped the marriage would lead to British support for his or his son's claim to the throne of Sweden. On a more personal level, there were hopes that marriage would suppress the frequent drinking and debauched behavior of the Crown Prince.\n\nThe couple had five children, one of whom did not survive infancy. Although the marriage was arranged, the couple got along quite well, and at least during the first years, their relationship was described as happy. Although Frederick came to feel high regard for her and always treated her with kindness, he reportedly was not in love with her and continued to have affairs after their marriage. However Frederick was comfortable with her, and Louise pretended not to notice his adultery with multiple partners, notably with Else Hansen. She quickly made herself popular in the Danish court, and her father-in-law remarked that she seemed to him to be kind and agreeable.\n\nWhen her husband ascended the throne, on 6 August 1746, as Frederick V, Louise became Queen of Denmark and Queen of Norway.\n\nQueen Louise was very popular in Denmark, and the great popularity of the royal couple has been attributed to Louise. Interested in music, dance and theatre, the royal court acquired a more easy-going tone than under her strictly religious parents-in-law. Louise had a vivacious personality, allowing her to socialize easily with others. In 1747, she arranged for the Italian opera company of Pietro Mingotti, whose members included Christoph Willibald Gluck and Giuseppe Sarti, to play at the royal court theater, and in 1748, the French Du Londel Troupe was invited for dramatic performances.\n\nHer effort to speak the Danish language, including with her children, was much appreciated, as the royal Danish court spoke mostly German. She studied the Danish language under the court priest Erik Pontoppidan, and also hired teachers so that her children could learn to speak their country's language. She was described as well educated and good at conversation, not beautiful but very dignified and well suited to her role as queen. A Swedish diplomat stationed in Denmark described her as follows: \n\nQueen Louise unsuccessfully opposed the dynastic marriage between her daughter Sophia Magdalena and Crown Prince of Sweden in 1751. The reason was her fear that her daughter would not be well treated by the Queen of Sweden, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. Louisa Ulrika was known for her anti-Danish views and for being opposed to the match, and it was known that she was the real ruler at the Swedish court. Reportedly, Louise also disliked arranged marriages because of her own marriage.\n\nWhile pregnant with her sixth child, Louise died due to complications from a miscarriage on 19 December 1751, a day after her 27th birthday, at Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen, predeceasing her husband by fourteen years. She was buried at Roskilde Cathedral.\n\n"}

It was designed by a team of engineers led by Dean Sicking at the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It was developed from 1998–2002, and first installed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May 2002.\n\nThe SAFER barrier consists of structural steel tubes welded together in a flush mounting, strapped in place to the existing concrete retaining wall. Behind these tubes are bundles of closed-cell polystyrene foam, placed between the barrier and wall. The theory behind the design is that the barrier absorbs a portion of the kinetic energy released when a race car makes contact with the wall. This energy is dissipated along a longer portion of the wall. The impact energy to the car and driver are reduced, and the car is likewise not propelled back into traffic on the racing surface.\n\nThe SAFER barrier also lessens damage to the car itself, thereby reducing repair costs. After its introduction in 2002, nearly every oval track on the IndyCar and NASCAR circuits had the device installed by 2005. Road and street tracks apply SAFER barriers on high speed cornering sections where space is limited.\n\nThe SAFER Barrier and its developers have won several awards within the racing and engineering community, including the Louis Schwitzer Award, Pocono Raceway Bill France, Sr. Award of Excellence, NASCAR Bill France, Jr. Award of Excellence, R&D 100 Award, SEMA Motorsports Engineering Award, GM Racing Pioneer Award, Autosport Pioneering and Innovation Award. Sicking also received the National Science and Technology Medal from President George W. Bush, in part due to his work on the SAFER Barrier and on other roadside safety devices.\n\nThroughout the decades of organized professional automobile racing, track owners and sanctioning bodies were constantly developing and attempting to utilize various devices to protect drivers and spectators in the event of a crash. Tire barriers, water and sand barrels, Styrofoam blocks, gravel traps, guardrails, earth embankments, and other various low-cost devices were implemented, with a varying level of success and usefulness. In most cases, the devices were practical for road and street courses, but impractical, or particularly inappropriate for oval tracks. \n\nOval tracks typically were constructed with reinforced concrete walls around the entire perimeter of the track (and along all or parts of the inside perimeters). The high speeds of oval track racing required strong walls to prevent cars from leaving the racing surface and protect spectators alike, primarily due to centrifugal force. Early years saw metal guardrails on the outside perimeters at some oval tracks, but their limitations and troublesome results saw them completely phased out by the late 1980s. The concrete walls generally showed favorable protection for spectators, and even against large NASCAR stock cars, routinely held up nearly unscathed during crashes. However, the hard surface and unforgiving nature of the walls were prone to cause injury to the drivers in a crash. \n\nIn the later years of the 20th century, sharply increasing speeds and several high-profile fatal accidents accelerated the need and public outcry for safety improvements at the track level. The undesirable results or outright failures of existing safety devices required the need for a full-scale research and development of a new device.\n\nThroughout the 1970s–1990s, Indycar constructors, for instance, had attempted to address the issue of impact dissipation through car design. Pieces of the car (wheel assemblies, wings, bodywork, etc.) were designed to breakaway after impact, absorbing kinetic energy. Crumple zones were also created. While it typically yielded positive results, it also had drawbacks. The debris field created new hazards for cars approaching the crash scene, and if cars hit pieces of the debris, it could be propelled into the spectator areas. In two high-profile incidents multiple spectators were fatally injured when sheared off wheel assemblies were punted into the grandstands.\n\nThe precursor to the SAFER Barrier was developed in 1998. The Polyethylene Energy Dissipating System (or PEDS Barrier) was developed by the Indy Racing League and retired GM engineer John Pierce at Wayne State University. The device consisted of PE cylinders mounted upright along the concrete wall, covered with plates of the same material, overlapping each other in the direction of travel. The plates mounting pattern resembled scales on a fish.\n\nThe PEDS barrier was installed on a trial basis at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in time for the 1998 Indianapolis 500. It was installed along the inside wall near the entrance to the pits. However, it was not impacted during the race. About two months later, the barrier received its first full-scale test. During the 1998 IROC at Indy race, Arie Luyendyk spun and impacted the barrier broadside with his IROC stock car. The violent impact ripped many of the PEDS Barrier components from the wall, threw them high into the air, and littered the track with huge amounts of debris. Luyendyk's car bounced off the wall, across the track and back into oncoming traffic. The car was narrowly missed by another car approaching at high speed.\n\nThough the barrier was credited with saving Luyendyk from serious injury, it was deemed mostly a failure due to the flaws that were exposed with the design. A slightly updated version (PEDS-2) was installed for a trial basis for the 1999 Indianapolis 500, but after driver Hideshi Matsuda impacted it, another major flaw (the tendency to \"catch and pivot\") was exposed. The barrier was removed soon after.\n\nAfter the mixed results with the PEDS Barrier, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway contacted engineers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln starting in the fall of 1998, in order to spearhead development of a new barrier. Dean Sicking at the Midwest Roadside Safety Facility led the project, sponsored and bankrolled by the Indy Racing League, with some support from NASCAR.\n\nWith the primary goal of reducing driver impact, the project also had the following objectives:\n\nThe SAFER Barrier development was completed in the spring of 2002, and was first installed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in May 2002, in time for the 2002 Indianapolis 500. It was first \"tested\" by Robby McGehee in a crash during the first day of practice. \n\nAfter successful usage at Indianapolis, the system began to be installed at several other tracks nationwide. By 2006, every oval facility that hosted an IRL IndyCar Series or NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event included the SAFER barrier. In 2006, Iowa Speedway became the first racetrack to install a purpose-built, self-standing SAFER barrier that extends around the entire outer circumference of the track. All previous installations had been the retrofit style to an existing concrete wall only in the turns. Most oval speedways more than a mile in length in the United States have since installed the system. Several tracks that had SAFER barriers initially installed in the turns in the early/mid-2000s have extended their barriers to more than just the turns, some to the entire perimeter. Many have added additional barriers along the inside walls. \n\nAn interesting challenge was presented with Dover International Speedway. When officials came to install the barrier, they found the wall, which was made of steel and not concrete, would not support the system. Officials were able to install the system on the inside concrete wall successfully. After a re-design and further testing, the system was installed a year and a half later.\n\nThe barrier received its first road course usage when Watkins Glen International adopted the SAFER barrier for key sections of the circuit, most notably in the bus stop chicane and Turn 11 for 2010. International road and street track adoption for the SAFER barrier has progressed gradually. Typically they are installed on high speed cornering sections, where space for runoff areas or gravel traps is limited and side impacts are of concern. Notable uses include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2196042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196042", "title": "The Enchanted World", "text": "The Enchanted World\n\nThe Enchanted World was a series of twenty-one books published in the 1980s. Each book focused on different aspects of mythology or folklore, and all were released by Time Life Books. Their overall editor was Ellen Phillips and their primary consultant was Tristram Potter Coffin, a Guggenheim Fellowship Award-winning University of Pennsylvania Professor Emeritus of English.\n\nThe volumes in the series were known for their art and the extensive research used in their stories. The books often overlap; for example, while King Arthur and his knights only have one book completely devoted to them, \"Fall of Camelot,\" they often appear in other books. Half of \"Legends of Valor\" is about them, and they appear in \"Wizards and Witches,\" \"Fairies and Elves,\" \"Dwarfs,\" \"Spells and Bindings,\" and \"Giants and Ogres.\"\n\nA unique part of the series was that its books were written as stories, taking place from an \"in the universe\" perspective, presenting its subjects as real people, places, and things. Related to such things having once been real, a common thread through several of them was its documentation of the alleged decline of magical things from \"when the world was young\" to the modern day. The subjects—dragons, dwarfs, giants—are presented as being potent and strong at the dawn of time, but magical creatures grow weaker and eventually disappear as humans spread and demystify the world, though there is always the promise that the magic will return once again.\n\nChristendom is often related to the decline. Though \"The Enchanted World\" describes it as humankind's greatest shield against those magics and beings of magic that would prove hostile to it, it proved detrimental even to good magic as people ceased to believe in the old gods in favor of Christ. According to the series, this was because Christianity was centered around a god of reason and that it promised a clearly defined universe of order and stability, a universe where there could be only one god. Magic could hardly thrive under such circumstances. It continued to exist either in opposition to Christianity or, more often, in connection to in-between places and in-between things. The series states that magic had always had a strong connection to things that were neither one thing nor another because as neither one thing nor another, such things could escape definition and be more than what they appeared.\n\nThe popularity of the \"Enchanted World\" series was followed by the \"Mysteries of the Unknown\" series.\n\n\"In order of publication:\"\n\nBrendan Lehane's book opens stating that in the earliest days the world was not yet fully ordered and the process of creation not yet completed. Since reality was fluid, it was relatively easy for mighty wizards such as Finland's Väinämöinen, Taliesin, Manannán mac Lir, Math the Ancient and Gwydion to cast their magic. Magic in those days was almost instinctual and inborn; it was an art. Those days ended with Merlin, the last and greatest of the old wizards. Famous for his aiding King Arthur and the realm of Camelot when he withdrew from the world, magic itself began to withdraw and the wizards retreated from human sight.\n\nAs a result of Christianity clearly setting and defining the world, the use of magic became much more difficult and even dangerous. It was difficult because it was no longer an art to be understood instinctively but a science that required years of study. It was dangerous because to challenge the order of reality was to challenge God the author of that reality, and, more often than not, the only being willing to aid a wizard in such an effort was Satan himself. Some wizards earned their powers legitimately and used them responsibly; Roger Bacon is one example, as revealed in one tale. Others, such as Michael Scot, gambled their souls by attending the Scholomance, the school of black magic. Still others, such as Faustus, took the quick and easy way and made deals with the Devil, always with grisly results.\n\nConcurrent with the scholar wizards were their more humble cousins, the witches. Unlike their male counterparts, their magic retained links to the natural world. Some witches were good and were called white witches, cunning folk, and fairy doctors. They tended to be good Christians and they used their powers for good; their spells were often indistinguishable from prayers. The White Paternoster is just one example. They were needed to counterbalance and oppose their evil sisters who used their powers for the sake of greed, revenge, or even just cruel pleasure. They more often than not placed themselves in the service of the devil and served as his perfect followers. The Witches' Sabbath was their chief pleasure.\n\nLehane closes that as time marched on and witches retreated from humankind, their magic was forgotten and relegated to stories for scaring children. Even so, their ancestors, the sleeping wizards, are still alive and waiting for the time to awaken.\n\nThe book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following three chapters, which each contain sub-chapters and side bar stories.\n\n\n\"Dragons\" opens recounting the legends of Apep, Tiamat, Jörmungandr, Nidhoggr, and Typhon. Born before time began, these creatures were sons of chaos, and so the gods did battle with them, for only when they were beaten could order prevail and the universe be born. Across various cultures, the same told was told with Set and Ra, Marduk, Thor, and Zeus playing the same role. The gods ultimately did prevail and these cosmic dragons were destroyed but the fight was not yet over because they left descendants with whom mortals would do battle. Cadmus's dragon was one example.\n\nChinese dragons and other Asian dragons were an exception to all this; unlike their western cousins, they never lost their semi-divine status and, again unlike them, they were mostly benevolent. The creator goddess Nu Kua was herself partly dragon, and the Emperor of China sat on the Dragon Throne. The Dragon Kings governed wind and water and for the rain they sent the Chinese people loved them.\n\nNo such love was present for European dragons. While not always evil as seen with the Laidly Worm, dragons were nearly always a threat, and even when they were not, they guarded treasures that man sought, whether gold or water or something else. They had to be destroyed and Christianity, \"the hammer of the dragon race,\" proved one of the most powerful weapons against them because it promised a world in which dragons, creatures of appetite, could have no place. Some saints killed their dragons, such as Saint Margaret, while other saints, such as Carantoc, tamed theirs. Regardless of the good intentions of men like Carantoc, however, peaceful coexistence between man and dragon was almost impossible as the tale of Saint Martha and Tarasque shows. The dragonslayers rose up to destroy them as well. Saint George is the most famous example. A dragonslayer could expect to win gold, women, and everlasting glory, but it was usually a quest for survival. In the end, humans civilized the world and drove dragons to extinction.\n\nThe book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters and side bar stories.\n\n\nUnlike other books in the series, this text does not concentrate on the decline of magic, though it does state that in the beginning, beings of pure magic (not exactly gods but more than mortal) freely intermingled with mortals (the friendship of Arawn and Pwyll is one example) only to separate themselves later on. They were known to the Norse as the Alfar or elves in English and sometimes as fairies, a word that derives from the Latin fatum/fate and fatare/enchant. Fairie correctly refers to their lands or magic. In contrast to mortals, beings who sought order, these magical beings were said to be very fickle and unpredictable. Even members of the usually good Seelie Court were prone to mischief.\n\nThe chief classifications were the trooping and solitary fairies the aristocrats and peasants of their kind. Among the Trooping fairies are mentioned the Sidhe, the Tuatha Dé Danann and the children of the Dagda. Though friendly enough to their mortal counterparts, they eventually withdrew from their sight and were replaced in mortal interactions by their smaller cousins. Leshy, polevik, and other nature spirits continued to haunt the wilds of the world. They were all very unpredictable; some were friendly to humans and used their powers to help them with their household chores while others were cruel and delighted in tormenting mortals.\n\nInevitably, the fairies weakened in the wake of humanity. This was in changelings; a fairy mother would exchange her child with a human child, perhaps to add the vigor of humanity to a weakening race. Also, the friendly meetings which had characterized their relationship with mortals grew increasingly rare. Husbands of swan maidens often won their wives only through deceit. True love was possible between fairies and mortals but, as in the case of Melusine, the love failed when the mortal husband broke the wife's trust.\n\nThe book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.\n\n\nThis book about ghosts opens starting with one of the many ghost stories contained throughout the book. A short excerpt, \"Late one spring night in the last century, a certain Englishman found himself, to his astonishment, standing in the garden outside his house. It was quite bewildering. He remembered falling asleep in his bed, but he had no memory of waking and walking out the door. Yet here he was, shivering in the chill, his bare feet buried in rain-soaked grass. Another surprise awaited him: when he tried the door, it proved to be locked.\"\n\nThe book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.\n\n\nWritten by Brendan Lehane, \"Legends of Valor\" centers primarily on Cúchulainn and the world of the Ulster Cycle, and later on King Arthur and the Matter of Britain. Other heroes briefly mentioned are Perseus, Sigurd, and Roland from Greek myth, Volsunga saga, and the Matter of France/Song of Roland, respectively.\n\nIn detailing the life of Cuchulain, Lehane writes that in the early world, tribes needed champions to protect them and lead them in battle. The king could not risk his life, so in his place a hero fought and were the jewels in a king's crown. It emphasizes that heroes were often born to gods and mortal Queens—it was not given to peasants to sire or spawn heroes. Such men were warriors and were expected to be fierce and savage. Their lives were short, bound to vows of vengeance and the \"cruel demands of honor.\" The life of Irish hero Cuchulain is retold, and with it, how while there were other men of the Red Branch, he proved himself the greatest champion of Conchobar mac Nessa, King of Ulster. Cuchulain, the son of Lugh fought bravely for his king and became a warrior without peer, although he was killed by Maeve who tricked him into breaking his various vows or geis. After Cuculain's death, Ireland was plunged into chaos, though later, as the Fenian cycle told, order was restored. Leading men milder and more civilized, but just as valiant, High King Cormac Mac Art and his Fianna protected Ireland from invasion. Even there conflicting vows could spell doom as when Grianne betrayed her husband the king by sleeping with his champion Diarmuid.\n\nThe rest of the story centers on the \"Brotherhood of the Round Table.\" Heroes still lived but they were different from their forebears, most notably in the moralizing effects of chivalry. A knight was expected to be kind to women, to show mercy to defeated foes, and to refuse no plea for help. Horses also gave men greater mobility. Under the salvific influence of Christianity, Arthur and his men were the finest heroes in all Christendom and beyond. Despite the Christian kingdom of Camelot being at peace, such men were needed as giants, dragons, and witches made Britain a place of wonder and danger. Some magical beings, such as the Lady of the Lake, proved friends. However, those who would harm the innocent were kept at bay due to Arthur's Knights, chief among them Lancelot, the Lady's son. Unfortunately, Lancelot's love for Guinevere, Arthur's Queen, would bring down Camelot which was already grievously exhausted by the Grail Quest. In searching for the Holy Grail, the Knights of the Round Table did prove themselves the very best heroes of all times but the loss of so many good men in the quest crippled Camelot and left it vulnerable to decay from within. Arthur's bastard son Mordred, in the end, destroyed the perfect world his father tried to create, though it is promised that one day, Arthur will return.\n\nThe book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.\n\n\nThis book opens with one of many stories in the book about creatures of the night. The first story is an old Danish tale. Following is an excerpt, \"Within this hall, hearths and torches blazed warm and bright, and drinking horns passed freely among the warriors of the Scylding clan; bards intoned the praises of their chieftain, Hrothgar, the valorous King; harpists sang of warmth and light. Outside the hall, however, solitary in the cold and dark, another kind of being walked. Although manlike, that being was no man. Huge and hairy, it shambled through the night mists of fell and fen, its claws scrabbling from time to time in the dirt as it tore at its hapless prey - hares, ferrets and other small beasts.\"\n\nThe book contains 141 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.\n\n\n\"Water Spirits\" opens with the story of man who saved the life of a mermaid who promptly blessed him with the power to heal and to break witchcraft and cursed him so that every generation one man from his family would drown. This was done to illustrate people's fear of the sea as a mysterious and fickle place that could from one moment give life and in the other death. Water was hailed as the source of life; the Hindus worshipped the Ganges under the name of Ganga, Mimir's well gave Odin his wisdom, the Nile and the Jordan River built civilizations, and everywhere people sought the Fountain of Youth. \"Water Spirits\" then points out that the creation myths of many cultures imagine the universe coming out of the watery deep and that many cultures recalled a time when the world was washed clean of sinners by the Great Flood.\n\nHumans began taking the initiative in sea quests, however, as seen with Jason and his Argonauts. He was faithful to the gods and led a crew of heroes across the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Black Seas. Regardless of his initial faithfulness to the gods, those same gods destroyed Jason but turned the Argo into a constellation. That was a testimony to how fickle the gods could be, because sea gods were viewed in relation to their seas. Poseidon, for example, was as arbitrary as the enchanted seas and magic islands he ruled. On the contrary, the kinder Ea came from the calmer Persian Gulf to teach men civilization and agriculture whilst the consistently cruel Rán ruled the volatile North Sea. The gods would lose their strength, however.\n\nIn Christian times, sailors no longer worshipped the sea gods but still lived in fear of the sea's power. For example, ships were still launched on Woden's Day/Wednesday and not, for example, on Thor's Day for fear of storms and thunder. Figureheads replaced the \"oculi,\" or eyes, of Greek Triremes, but the function remained the same; keep a lookout for evil. Anointing a ship with wine replaced the pagan custom on smearing ships with animal and even human blood. There were limits, as seen with how Christian priests were rarely let on board for fear of angering the old gods.\n\nLakes and rivers held their powers too in the form of Nixes and Undines. The Japanese told of Urashima and Europeans of selkies and mermaids; daughters of foam-born Aphrodite, they were carved on churches as warning against lust.\n\nThe book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.\n\n\n\"Magical Beasts\" opens with a recounting of how early in humanity's existence the world was locked in an Ice Age. Humans feared the animals and worshipped the cave bear. Time passed and the cave bear perished, but other beast gods remained such as Cernunnos. The gods of Egypt were beast men and the Greeks spoke of their gods disguising themselves as animals. There are other examples such as Chiron; a centaur, he was hailed as the divine beast. There came the day, however, that Pan, the goat god, died and the beast gods's decline began. This was seen in how animalistic Fomorians of Ireland had lost their magic and were forced to ruling with brute force. They and Balor, their king, were routed by his grandson Lugh of the Long Hand, champion of the ascendant Tuatha de Danaan. Magic was dying as Europe was Christianized, but there were other places in the world such as Asia where magic yet held sway and dog men, monopods, and Blemmyes.\n\nIt also recounts that many flying animals, both mundane and magical, commanded respect for reason that they were able to escape the mundane world by flight. Pegasus, the roc, simurghs, firebirds, the phoenix, and even ordinary birds like the raven in mythology and the robin were revered. Other flying animals were also known such as griffins, harpies and tengus.\n\nOf all magical beasts, however, the unicorn was the most respected. It epitomised beauty and purity but courage as well because it would never let itself be taken alive. Its cousins included China's ki-lin and the Persian karkadann which, unlike their European counterpart, respectively embodied only gentility or ferocity. All, however, could be tamed by maidens. Unicorn horns also had the power to cure poison and disease; in their desire to obtain the horns, humans drove unicorns to extinction.\n\nThe text mentions other beasts such as the manticore, mermecolion, barometz, basilisk, and peryton.\n\nThe book contains 143 pages and is divided into the following three chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.\n\n\nDwarfs (actual spelling used in book - this is the traditional spelling - \"dwarves\" comes from \"The Hobbit\" author J.R.R. Tolkien and was an intentional change of spelling) opens with the \"Younger (\"Prose\") Edda,\" a narration of Norse mythology. It opens with Norse dwarves and tells how the race began soon after Odin and his Aesir killed Ymir, using his flesh to make the earth. The maggots that crawled from the flesh became dwarfs. Corpse grey and subterranean troglodytes, the gods tended to look down on them but the dwarfs, brash and brazen, knew that when Aesir needed weapons or wanted luxuries that the dwarfs by their magical craftsmanship alone could provide what was needed. While author Tim Appenzeller admits that such tales contain much fiction, they still contain a grain of truth.\n\nHowever, in time the dwarfs lost the ability, or the will, to stand as equals to the gods and walked among mortals. With the pagan gods dead and \"the\" God and His Church dominant, a new world had dawned. Even so, the dwarf kings such as Herla or Laurin of the Tyrol's Mountains were not afraid and outshone their cavedwelling ancestors in splendor. The dwarfs adapted well to Christian Europe, befriending mortals; Alberich, for example, was famous for befriending King Otnit of Lombardy and going with him to Syria to help him win an exotic pagan princess for a bride. The tale of Elidor is also recounted.\n\nThe dwarfs' decline is further explored with the dwarfish peasantry. They were friendly towards mortal peasants with whom they shared parallel lives and they often helped each other just as their respective kings did. However, as humans grew stronger, forming centralized states, large cities, roads, and factories, and as the dwarfs's own magic began to fail them, the fragile ties of friendship began to unravel and most dwarfs left the mortal world. Those that remained, abandoned by their fellows suffered a diaspora and placed themselves at mortals' mercy. They went on to become household spirits slavishly serving as domestic help of their particular mortals, though even there they would go into retreat. The last sightings of dwarfs concerned the Knockers, beings that lived in mines and watched over miners. While, the text says, miners would give them food and drink; these were offerings, not rewards. Tim Appenzeller goes on to speculate that knockers are just the most visible members of hidden dwarf kingdoms. While some of them might be recent dwarf refugees from the outside world, some of them might have always lived there, \"awaiting the day when their earth-shaping skills will once again dazzle mortals and gods alike.\"\n\nThe book contains 141 pages and is divided into the following four chapters, which each contain sub-chapters.\n\n\nOn magical spells.\n\n\n\"Giants and Ogres\" opens by stating that at the dawn of time, the giants were the mightiest of beings, creatures whom even the gods feared. It cites the legends of Og, Orion, Cronus, and Ymir, and shows that in those earliest of days, giants were indeed wielders of incredible size and strength. However, these \"princes of the cosmos\" were also superior to the gods (their children) in authority, wisdom, and magic. In fact, it was from the giants that the Greek and Norse gods had to wrest their dominion. Even after, as was seen in the Northlands where the giants held to their power the longest, the gods looked to the giants as equals, beings to whom they would turn in search of wisdom.\n\nHowever, as the \"first world\" ended and they lost their equality with the gods, giants assimilated into mortal society. Some, such as Bran the Blessed, went on to become kings and heroes, worthy heirs of their ancestors. Others befriended and watched over the peasantry; some giantesses even used their magic as midwives for their tiny neighbors. However, as the giants' decline accelerated, they grew increasingly hostile to humans. They became enemies of humanity, using their superior strength and their magic to attack the younger race that was taking over their world. Their cousins, the trolls and the ogres, became outright predators raping human women and eating human men. Examples such as the giant who had no heart in his body or of the giant who faced Jack atop the beanstalk (illustrated by the talented Barry Moser, and his company, Pennyroyal Press) are cited.\n\nBy the end of their existence, when men like King Arthur and Charlemagne ruled, the giants were totally defeated. While there remained a few wise and noble giants such as Ferragus, who battled Roland, they were the exceptions. Most had shrunk in size to the point that they were only slightly larger than humans. Worse, the giants—beings whose wisdom even the gods had once envied—became degenerate cretins, who could be bested by mere children's tricks. Though the giants disappeared, the common folk never forgot them, they remembered the great monuments they had built, such as Giant's Causeway, and the Long Man of Wilmington, as illustrated by Willi Glasauer.\n\n\nTales and beliefs about the adventures of explorers, heroes, and damsels.\n\n\nAbout Mythological places\n\n\nBrendan Lehane's \"Book of Christmas\" opens with a brief retelling of the Nativity story told in the Gospels of Luke and Mark. It recounts Mary and Joseph going to Bethlehem and the birth of Jesus Christ but states that the pattern was already set. The fact that the birth of Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness, is celebrated in December is no accident. There are many winter festivals. Most people worshipped the sun as a god and so were afraid when winter came and it seemed that the lifegiving sun grew weak; thus they celebrated the Solstice, the winter day when the weakening sun regained its strength. In fact, many Christmas traditions have their roots in pre-Christian traditions but it was the birth of Jesus that made a season of fear into a season of hope.\n\nSuch fears are mentioned in tales of animal and even human sacrifice meant to appease the pagan gods such as Odin in hopes of surviving winter. Christmas was also said to be the time of the dead; as it was the time when the whole world seemed to die and was an undefined in between time, it was only right the ghosts and monsters rise up against mortals. Similarly, the Wild Hunt and its various leaders are recounted, various heathen deities such as Berchta and Gwyn ap Nudd being cast out by their former worshippers in favor of the Christian God whose mortal birth those worshippers celebrated.\n\nHowever, while winter could be terrifying, Lehane asserts that most Christians were not afraid. They celebrated a topsy-turvy Christmastide with mummers and plays and feasts led by the Abbot of Misrule. Christmas was a time filled with old magic when animals could talk and nature spirits abounded, but followers of the new religion saw nothing strange in keeping their ancestors' pagan traditions alive. Their faith was not the abolition, but rather the fulfillment, of their old rituals because with Jesus, the rituals meant to hold back winter's darkness were vindicated. Lehane states, \"In the Child born at Bethlehem, they had the promise of spring in the heart of midwinter, the divine gift of a bright, cleansing flame to drive away the dark.\"\n\n\nThe book is 143 pages long. It is divided into seven chapters. Each chapter deals with a different person in the life of King Arthur.\n\n1. Arthur (pg.8)\n\nArthur's father, Uther Pendragon sees Igraine, the beautiful wife of Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall. He desires her and asks for help from the Wizard, Prophet and Enchanter Merlin. Merlin promises to do this in exchange for any child that may be conceived from the union. Merlin enchants Uther to look like Gorlois and Uther has his way with Igraine. Nine months later, Arthur is born and taken away by Merlin. He is raised in secret in Wales until the age of fifteen. During a tournament in London, Arthur, acting as a squire, while searching for a sword for the knight he serves, finds the Sword in the Stone in a church courtyard and pulls it out, thereby proving to the world that he is the rightful heir to the throne of England. Even with this heavenly mandate, Arthur still is forced to defeat many other armies in battle in order to win the throne.\n\n2. Morgause (pg.20)\n\nIgraine and Lord Gorlois had had three daughters before Lord Gorlois died. These daughters knew that Arthur was their half-brother. Arthur, though, was unaware. The eldest of the three daughters, Morgause, travelled to Camelot, where Arthur fell in love with her. Merlin prophesied that if Arthur slept with Morgause that the child that would come of it would destroy England and kill Arthur. Arthur ignored this counsel and took Morgause anyway. She then became pregnant and left before Arthur was aware of it. The child that he fathered that evening was Mordred.\n\n3. Guinevere (pg.36)\n\nGuinevere was the daughter of Lord Leodegrain. Arthur fell in love with her and married her. During the wedding feast, Guinevere asked Merlin to perform some magic for her and the guests as entertainment. At first he declined, but then later created an illusion that entertained, but also upset many. After the spell was complete, Merlin told all that his act of casting magic had alerted the Old Ones who were now looking at and paying attention to King Arthur and his court. Having the attention of the Old Ones is something that is not preferred. It can bring a lot of pain.\n\n4. Morgan (pg.56)\n\nAll of Gorlois and Igraine's three daughters hated Arthur, but Morgan, the youngest, hated him the most. But she hid her hate well. Arthur knew neither that she was his sister nor that she hated him. She and her husband came to live with Arthur in Camelot, where her husband worked as one of Arthur's knights. Morgan, though, was very beautiful, and many of the knights chose to be close to her. One day, Arthur was kidnapped by a knight who was having an affair with Morgan. Before the fight, Morgan had stolen Arthur's sword Caliburn and had given it to her lover. She then also gave Arthur a cursed copy of his own sword. During the fight, the cursed sword slowed Arthur down and took away enough of his strength that he was about to lose the fight. But the Lady of the Lake arrived, magically pulled the sword from the hand of his enemy, and returned it to Arthur. Arthur, who won the fight, also became aware of Morgan's hate for him. Nevertheless, Morgan tried to kill Arthur several other times, unsuccessfully.\n\n5. Lancelot (pg.74)\n\nAt birth, Lancelot's name was Galahad, but after his father was killed and his father's castle destroyed, he was taken and raised by the Lady of the Lake. This was where he received the name Lancelot. He is also sometimes referred to as the \"Fair Foundling\" and \"Lancelot du Lac.\" He was the greatest of all knights. No one was his equal.\n\nHe was presented to Arthur when he was eighteen by the faeries. Arthur took him in and trained him to be a knight. Lancelot and Guinevere though fell in love at first sight and they had a secret affair that lasted for years. Morgan, Arthur's half-sister, found out about this affair and informed the King about it.\n\nLancelot had a son with another woman and gave him the name Galahad, which had been his own birth name.\n\n6. Mordred (pg.90)\n\nMordred was unaware for a long time that his father was Arthur. He came with his mother Morgause and lived in Camelot, where he eventually became one of Arthur's knights. During one travel, Mordred and Lancelot met an old man who prophesied to Mordred that he would kill his own father, Arthur, destroy the knights of the round table, and kill the old man as well, but that his father, Arthur, would also kill him. This is how Mordred found out that Arthur was his father. Mordred grew so angry that he drew his sword and killed the old man instantly. Lancelot felt like killing Mordred for his cruelty, but chose not to.\n\nMordred eventually found out about the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere, and thus, he followed Lancelot and Guinevere and found a place where they were sleeping. In consequence, Mordred brought many knights there to act as witnesses of the affair. Lancelot fought his way out and left Camelot, but Guinevere was taken and arrested. Arthur was law-bound to punish his wife and the law demanded that she be burned at the stake.\n\nThe next day, many knights had left Camelot, as everyone had loved Guinevere, and her execution sentence seemed so unjust that the round table was broken. Many knights abandoned their brotherhood. The two knights who were ordered to tie her to the stake and burn her refused to wear their armor to do it. They did not agree with the sentence either, and refused to obey it as knights. But as the fires were lit, a band of rebel knights, led by Lancelot, burst into Camelot, killed the men who had been ordered to execute Guinevere, and took Guinevere away to safety.\n\n7. Gawain (pg.118)\n\nThe brother of the two knights slain by Lancelot was Gawain. He had been a knight to King Arthur for years and was one of Arthur's most trusted allies. Gawain's anger for Lancelot was deep and insatiable. Nothing would end his anger except the death of Lancelot. Arthur, who now controlled many fewer knights than before, could not risk losing his greatest ally, so, Arthur and his remaining troops camped around the stronghold where Lancelot now lived in France. Guinevere had long since been returned to Camelot after Lancelot vowed to all that no affair had ever taken place. Guinevere was safe because of Lancelot's lie, but Gawain's anger was still demanded that Lancelot die. The siege lasted weeks. During the siege, Arthur received a note that said that Mordred had told the people that Arthur had died in battle and that Mordred was now King. The note also said that Mordred had vowed to take Guinevere as his wife.\n\nArthur immediately returned to Camelot with all of his forces. There was a great battle in which Gawain, Arthur and Mordred were slain. Mordred killed Arthur and as he died, Arthur's stroke also killed his son Mordred.\n\n\n\n\nCreation myths and folklore.\n\n\n\n\n\"The Enchanted World\" was advertised with a series of commercials transmitted either in first-run syndication or during late-night television programming. The first of these known to be transmitted featured four people who described themselves as being in touch with the Enchanted World:\n1. Susan Hammett, who called herself an authentic witch. She began the first commercial by saying:\n\"People think that witches only exist in fairy tales. I'm living proof that we're real--and still around today! In fact...I'm from a \"long line\" of witches.\"\n2. Litany Burns, a self-styled clairvoyant. Her statement was:\n\"Ever since I was a child, I've been able to see things that aren't visible to ordinary senses. So ghosts are nothing new to me. I've seen them many times.\"\n3. Olga Hayes, a tarot card reader. According to her statement:\n\"The tarot cards are over five hundred years old. With them, I can tell a person's future. I can also tell what they were--in another life.\"\nAnd\n4. Wayne Weiseman, a self-styled psychic and the only male participant in the commercial. As he phrased his contacts with the Enchanted World:\n\"There are times when I find myself in another world. (He here faced the camera more directly.) I'm actually there. A lot of people have this power. They just have to develop it.\"\n\nAt least two of the later commercials featured actor Vincent Price, well known for his frequent roles in horror films.\nThe first of these, which featured a series of animals—first a rabbit, then a crow or a raven, then a frog, then a cat—transforming into each from the last through special photographic effects, had him, as the narrator, exhorting viewers, \"Enter 'The Enchanted World.'\" At the end of this commercial, the cat transformed—again, through special photographic effects—into a human; specifically, self-styled authentic witch Susan Hammett from the previous commercial, who pointed out, \"After all, how can you be \"sure\" witches don't exist--if you don't know what one \"looks\" like?\"\nIn the second, Price was shown on camera promoting the series and reading at least one of the books by candlelight. At one point, a gust of wind from an open window blew out the candle, which Price re-lit with a match. Then, through lighting trickery, his skin turned glowing green.\n\nAll the commercials ended with announcer Ted Alexander providing a toll-free telephone number for viewers to call, together with a mailing address where payment for each book in the series could be sent after a ten-day trial.\n"}

Its mission is to commemorate and educate about freedom of religion and conscience as proclaimed in Thomas Jefferson's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Located in the Shockoe Slip district of downtown Richmond, the Center sits on the site where Jefferson's statute was enacted into law by the Virginia General Assembly on January 16, 1786. Championed through the Virginia General Assembly by James Madison, the statute was the first law of absolute religious freedom enacted in the young nation and served as a template for the religion clauses of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would be ratified five years later (1791).\n\nThe Council for America’s First Freedom formed in Richmond in 1984 to prepare for the 1986 bicentennial of the Jan. 16, 1786, ratification of the Statute. The council registered the trademark for \"First Freedom Center\" with the US Patent office in 2003.\n\nThe First Freedom Center commemorates National Religious Freedom Day by an annual First Freedom Award presentation. The three annual awards include a Virginia First Freedom Award as well as national and international awards \n\nPast recipients of the award include: \n\nWhile educational and award activities happened for years, the Council pursued an actual \"bricks and mortar\" center for several years. In 2004, the center announced that groundbreaking for the center would occur in 2005 with doors to open in 2007. After some delays, the First Freedom Center opened in January 2015 with a commemoration featuring Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones. The FFC was taken over by The Valentine in July 2015.\n\nThe First Freedom Center is connected to the newly finished Courtyard and Residence Inns by Marriott (and owned by Apple Hospitality ) and features 2,200 square feet of installations that \"delve into America's experience with religious liberty from its European roots through today\" \n\nAccording to the Richmond Times Dispatch, \"The museum features statues of Jefferson and James Madison, along with exhibits and displays that trace and celebrate America’s experiment with religious liberty, from the 1600s through today. One wall will feature changing exhibits that highlight current events related to religious freedom. Outside is a 27-foot spire and a wall etched with a paragraph of the 1786 statute, which laid the foundation for the religious freedom guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.\" \n\n"}

It is their highest-charting album to date, reaching No. 7 on the UK Album Chart. The album takes its title from the Beach Boys album \"Carl and the Passions – \"So Tough\"\".\n\nThe album was indebted to sixties classics, \"The Who Sell Out\" by The Who, \"Smile\" by The Beach Boys and \"Head\" by The Monkees. The album was originally intended as a concept album which starts at \"Mario's Cafe\" in London then travels around the world, however it came to be viewed as a solely London album.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of the album is the use of samples between the songs. The band were keen to use linking dialogue, similar to that used in \"The Who Sell Out\" or on contemporary hip-hop albums. They are taken from a variety of sources including dialogue from film and television. The original sources include the films \"Peeping Tom\", \"Billy Liar\", \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", \"Lord of the Flies\" and \"That'll Be the Day\", as well as the television series \"The Family\" and the 1958 stereo demonstration album \"A Journey into Stereophonic Sound\". Additionally, the track \"Conchita Martinez\" features a recurring sample from the opening riff of Rush's 1980 hit \"The Spirit of Radio\". Martínez herself was a Spanish Grand Slam-winning tennis player in 1990s, who later went on to win the Wimbledon singles title.\n\nThe band had intended to use a number of samples from American films, but the cost of clearing these samples led them to using primarily British samples.\n\nThe song \"Mario's Cafe\" was inspired by a real Kentish Town restaurant of that name.\n\nThe album cover features a picture of lead singer Sarah Cracknell aged 6 taken by her father Derek Cracknell.\n\nThe album was reissued as a limited edition 2-CD set with \"You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone\".\n\nThe US release added \"Join Our Club\" (3:22), which had been a UK single in 1992. \"Who Do You Think You Are\" (3:49) is included on some US versions between \"Here Come Clown Feet\" and \"Junk the Morgue\". \"You're in a Bad Way\" (3:08), and \"Hobart Paving\" (4:57) are presented in their single versions, including extra instrumentation. The former is longer, while the latter features a drum pattern not present on the original version.\n\nThe album was reissued on 31 August 2009, as part of the ongoing Deluxe Editions of the band's recordings. The new release features B-sides, rare and unreleased tracks.\n\nThe liner notes list the album's personnel as follows:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2196050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196050", "title": "Castle Romeo", "text": "Castle Romeo\n\nCastle Romeo was the code name given to one of the tests in the Operation Castle series of American nuclear tests. It was the first test of the TX-17 thermonuclear weapon, the first deployed thermonuclear bomb.\n\nIt was detonated on March 27, 1954, at Bikini Atoll of the Marshall Islands, on a barge moored in the middle of the crater from the Castle Bravo test. It was the first such barge-based test, a necessity that had come about because the powerful thermonuclear devices completely obliterated the small islands following detonation.\n\nThe tested design became the first air-droppable thermonuclear device, initially the \"emergency capability\" EC-17, of which only five were made. The first deployable staged radiation implosion Teller-Ulam thermonuclear weapon evolved into the Mark 17, of which 200 were made. Both of those were huge devices, weighing and respectively. As a result, only the B-36 was capable of carrying that first generation of thermonuclear bombs. They were also some of the largest yield devices deployed by Strategic Air Command — the EC-17 producing around 10 megatonnes (Mt), and the Mk 17 between 11 and 15 Mt. They were all out of service by August 1957.\n\nThe \"Runt\" TX-15 device was a weaponized dry fusion bomb, using lithium deuteride fuel for the fusion stage of a staged fusion bomb, unlike the cryogenic liquid deuterium of the first-generation Ivy Mike fusion device.\n\nSimilar to the \"Shrimp\" TX-21 device tested before in the Castle Bravo test, it differed from that device in using lithium deuteride derived from natural lithium (a mixture of 7.5% lithium-6 and 92.5% lithium-7 isotopes) as the source of the tritium and deuterium fusion fuels, as opposed to the relative high enrichment level of lithium (approximately 40% lithium-6) deuteride used in Bravo.\n\nLike the Bravo test, it produced far more than its predicted yield, and for the same reason — an unexpected participation of the common lithium-7 isotope in fusion reactions. Although it had been predicted to produce a yield of 4 megatons with a range of 1.5 to 7 megatons (before the results of the Bravo test caused an upgrade in the estimates, it had originally been estimated to produce 3–5 megatons), it actually produced a yield of 11 megatons, the third-largest test ever conducted by the U.S.\n\nLike the Ivy Mike and Castle Bravo tests, a large percentage of the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium \"tamper\"; 7 megatons of the yield were from this source.\n\nOne particular image of the Castle Romeo fireball (at right) has been one of the most highly reprinted images of a nuclear explosion. It often serves as a stand-in for nuclear weapons in general for news stories, book covers, magazine articles, etc., likely because of its threatening appearance and extreme red, orange, and yellow hues. The fact that the explosion is of a US megaton-range weapon has not prevented it to be used to represent the arsenals of other states or weapons of far lower yields in many cases, which would have a very different appearance.\n\nOne prominent usage is as the backdrop for heavy metal band Megadeth's greatest hits compilation \"\". The image of Castle Romeo was also used on the cover of the New York hardcore music pioneers Cro-Mags debut album \"The Age of Quarrel\". It is also featured on the title screen of Team17's turn-based artillery game \"Worms Armageddon\".\n\nThe Castle Romeo photos are sometimes confused with that of Castle Bravo. The two nuclear blasts looked very similar, and they were both conducted in the same location, but much of Bravo's photographic record was destroyed because of its unexpectedly high yield.\n\n\n"}

Brown finished in the top-10 of European Tour Order of Merit in 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1983. His best season was 1978 when he finished fourth in the Order of Merit.\n\nBrown gained his PGA Tour card in late 1983, and played mainly on the PGA Tour from 1984 to early 1989, winning the Southern Open in 1987. Brown struggled in the early part of his first season, 1984, but from August he made the cut in his last 10 tournaments. Despite this he was 151st in the money list coming into the final event of the year, the Pensacola Open, and unlikely to retain his card by finishing in the top 125. Leading after three rounds, he eventually finished joint runner-up, lifting him to 112th in the money list. 1987 was his best season on the tour with six top-10 finishes. Brown had a poor start to the 1989 PGA Tour season and played the remainder of the season in Europe, losing his PGA Tour card. He continued to play on the European Tour but had relatively little success and retired in 1992.\n\nBrown played in five Ryder Cup matches, in 1977, 1979, 1983, 1985, and 1987. He had a 4-9-0 win-loss-tie record, including two wins and two losses in singles matches. He was vice-captain under Mark James in the 1999 matches. In 1977 Brown switched his allegiance from England to Scotland and later represented Scotland in a number of team competitions, including the World Cup on four occasions. Playing with Sandy Lyle they finished second in the 1979 World Cup. Brown played in the Open Championship 14 times. His best performance was in the 1980 Open at Muirfield where he was tied for second place after three rounds but a final round of 76 left him in a tie for sixth place.\n\nAfter retiring from playing, Brown has spent much of his time as a TV golf commentator and analyst, for the BBC and Fox Sports. He also worked as part of the commentary team for the international coverage of the European Tour on selected events. He started his TV work with Sky Sports, working on their PGA Tour and European Tour coverage in the early 1990s.\n\nBrown was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to sport and to broadcasting.\n\n\nEuropean Tour playoff record (0–2)\n\n\"Note: Brown never played in the U.S. Open.\"<br>\nCUT = missed the half-way cut<br>\n\"T\" = tied\n\n\n"}

The Continental Celtic languages were spoken by the people known to Roman and Greek writers as \"Keltoi\", \"Celtae\", \"Galli\" and \"Galatae\". These languages were spoken in an arc stretching across from Iberia in the west to the Balkans and Anatolia in the east.\n\nEven though Breton is spoken in continental Europe, and has been since at least the 6th century AD, it is not considered one of the Continental Celtic languages. It is a Brittonic language closely related to Cornish and Welsh. Whilst it has been suggested that there is a Gaulish substratum in the Vannetais dialect (Galliou and Jones 1991) the historical and linguistic evidence shows otherwise.\n\nAlthough it is likely that Celts spoke dozens of different languages and dialects across Europe in pre-Roman times, only a small number have been attested:\n\nThe modern term \"Continental Celtic\" is used in contrast to \"Insular Celtic\". While many researchers agree that Insular Celtic is a distinct branch of Celtic (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), having undergone common linguistic innovations, there is no evidence that the Continental Celtic languages can be similarly grouped. Instead, the group called \"Continental Celtic\" is paraphyletic and the term refers simply to non-Insular Celtic languages. Since little material has been preserved in any of the Continental Celtic languages, historical linguistic analysis based on the comparative method is difficult to perform. However, other researchers see the Brittonic languages and Gaulish as forming part of a sub-group of the Celtic languages known as P-Celtic. Continental languages are all P-Celtic except for Celtiberian, which is Q-Celtic, and have had a definite influence on all the Romance languages.\n\n\n"}

His father, Solomon Pollack, was a Jewish shop-owner who managed to avoid internment by the Nazi authorities and survived Nazi Germany. His mother, Bertha Pollack (née Diffring), was Christian. He studied acting in Berlin and Vienna, but there is conjecture about when he left Germany prior to the outbreak of World War II. The audio commentary for the \"Doctor Who\" series \"Silver Nemesis\" mentions that he left in 1936 to escape persecution due to his homosexuality. Other accounts point to him leaving in 1939 and going to Canada, where he was interned in 1940, which is unlikely as he appears in the Ealing Studios film \"Convoy\" (released in July 1940, as the officer of the U-37, in an uncredited role). His sister Jacqueline Diffring moved to England and became a sculptor. Although he made two fleeting uncredited appearances in films in 1940, it was not until 1950 that his acting career began to take off.\n\nWith numerous World War II dramatic productions in film and television being produced in England in the 1950s, Diffring's \"Germanic\" physical type of blond hair, pale blue eyes and chiselled features saw him often cast in roles as Nazi military officers in films such as \"Albert R.N. \" (1953) and \"The Colditz Story\" (1955). Some of his more notable roles as German characters were in \"The Heroes of Telemark\" (1965), \"The Blue Max\" (1966), \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968), as SS officer Reinhard Heydrich in \"Operation Daybreak\" (1975), and the football match commentator in \"Escape to Victory\" (1981), though he also played a Polish parachutist in \"The Red Beret\" (1953). He played Hitler's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in the American mini-series \"The Winds of War\" (1983). In the Italian war movie \"Uccidete Rommel\", shot in an Egyptian desert in 1969, he played the role of a British officer of the SAS. \n\nHe played an important part in the TV mini-series \"Flambards\", that of the aeronautical pioneer who assists William Russell (Alan Parnaby), second in line of inheritance to the Flambards Estate, who is obsessed with flying. Diffring's character was a German living in Britain shortly before the beginning of the Great War. \n\nDiffring starred in a number of horror films, such as \"The Man Who Could Cheat Death\" (1959) and \"Circus of Horrors\" (1960) and played the lead in the television pilot \"Tales of Frankenstein\" (1958). He also appeared in quite a number of international films, such as \"Fahrenheit 451\" (1966) directed by François Truffaut.\n\nHis final performance was again as a Nazi for the BBC in the 1988 \"Doctor Who\" serial \"Silver Nemesis\", in which he agreed to appear because the filming in England coincided with the Wimbledon Championships, which he wanted to attend.\n\nDiffring died on 19 May 1989 from cancer at his home in Châteauneuf-Grasse, in the South of France, at the age of 72. His body was buried in the graveyard of St. Andrew's Church, in the village of White Colne in Essex.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2196128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196128", "title": "Thomas of Bayeux", "text": "Thomas of Bayeux\n\nThomas of Bayeux (died 1100) was Archbishop of York from 1070 until 1100. He was educated at Liège and became a royal chaplain to Duke William of Normandy, who later became King William I of England. After the Norman Conquest, the king nominated Thomas to succeed Ealdred as Archbishop of York. After Thomas' election, Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, demanded an oath from Thomas to obey him and any future Archbishops of Canterbury; this was part of Lanfranc's claim that Canterbury was the primary bishopric, and its holder the head of the English Church. Thomas countered that York had never made such an oath. As a result, Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. The King eventually persuaded Thomas to submit, but Thomas and Lanfranc continued to clash over ecclesiastical issues, including the primacy of Canterbury, which dioceses belonged to the province of York, and the question of how York's obedience to Canterbury would be expressed.\n\nAfter King William I's death Thomas served his successor, William II, and helped to put down a rebellion led by Thomas' old mentor Odo of Bayeux. Thomas also attended the trial for rebellion of the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, Thomas' sole suffragan, or bishop subordinate to York. During William II's reign Thomas once more became involved in the dispute with Canterbury over the primacy when he refused to consecrate the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm, if Anselm was named the Primate of England in the consecration service. After William II's sudden death in 1100, Thomas arrived too late to crown King Henry I, and died soon after the coronation.\n\nThomas is sometimes referred to as Thomas I to distinguish him from his nephew Thomas, who was also an Archbishop of York. The elder Thomas' father was a priest named Osbert; his mother was named Muriel, but little else of them is known. He had a brother named Samson, who was Bishop of Worcester from 1086 until 1112. He was of Norman descent. Under the patronage of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, both boys were sent to Liège for their education. Thomas may also have studied with Lanfranc in Normandy while the latter was teaching at the Abbey of Bec, and some scholars contend that he also studied in Germany and Spain. Thomas then returned to Normandy to become one of Bishop Odo's officials and a chaplain, or secretary. He was a canon and the treasurer of Bayeux Cathedral as well as a member of Duke William's ducal clergy before the Norman Conquest of England. The new King named him a royal clerk after the Battle of Hastings.\n\nThomas succeeded Ealdred as Archbishop of York in 1070; he was nominated on 23 May and was probably consecrated on 25 December. The appointment of Thomas was a departure for the King, who had usually promoted Norman nobles or monks when he was still Duke of Normandy. The appointment was more consistent with English norms, as most of those appointed to the English episcopate before the Conquest had previously been royal clerks.\n\nShortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, pursuing a claim that Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined to make such a written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, it was the beginning of the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York.\n\nThe next year both archbishops travelled to Rome for their palliums, where Thomas took advantage of the opportunity to ask Pope Alexander II to decree that the sees of Canterbury and York were equal. Thomas also sought to have the pope declare that the midland sees of Worcester, Dorchester on Thames, and Lichfieldall south of the River Humberwere part of the Archdiocese of York rather than Canterbury. The 12th-century chronicler Eadmer, a monk at Canterbury, wrote much later that Thomas had resigned and surrendered his archiepiscopal symbols, but they were promptly returned to him by Lanfranc on the pope's orders. The story's partisan source casts some doubt on its accuracy.\n\nThe pope referred the dispute to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council decided that the Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics were taken from the province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England – such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.\n\nAll of these decisions were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or representative of the pope, as well as many bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to Alexander II, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope Gregory VII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.\n\nThomas reorganised the cathedral chapter during his archiepiscopate, establishing a group of secular canons with individual prebends to provide the clergy with income. The cathedral chapter at York had until then lived in a group, but Thomas' reforms allowed the clergy to live in their own houses. Thomas also set up a number of officials within the cathedral chapter, including a dean, treasurer, and precentor. He increased the number of clergy in the chapter, increasing it from the three he found at York when he took office, and reorganised the episcopal and chapter's estates, giving a number of estates to the chapter. He introduced the continental system of archdeacons to the Diocese of York, dividing the diocese into territorial units and appointing an archdeacon to each. Archdeacons were responsible for aiding the bishop or archbishop with his episcopal duties, collecting revenues, and presiding over some judicial courts.\n\nShortly before Thomas' appointment, York Minster, the cathedral of the archdiocese, was damaged in a fire that swept through York on 1069, and which also destroyed the refectory and dormitory for the canons. Soon after his consecration, Thomas had a new dormitory and refectory built and a new roof put on the cathedral; these appear to have been temporary measures however, as some time later, probably in about 1075, he ordered the construction of a new cathedral on a different site. The new building, much larger than the one it replaced, has not survived. It was excavated between 1966 and 1973, showing the plan of the cathedral to be different from most others built in England around that time. It was longer, had no aisles in the nave, and it had a rectangular ring crypt that had been long out of style in 1075. Because of the way the foundations were laid out, it appears likely that the entire building was planned and built in one design phase, with few modifications. It may have been that Thomas designed his cathedral to be as unlike Canterbury Cathedral as possible, perhaps because of the conflict between York and Canterbury over primacy. William of Malmesbury, a 12th-century writer, states that Thomas finished the cathedral, and this is corroborated by the fact that Thomas was buried in the minster in 1100. Some elements of Thomas' structure are still visible in the crypt of York Minster.\n\nAfter the death of the Conqueror, Thomas was loyal to the third son, William Rufus, who had inherited England instead of the eldest brother, Robert Curthose. Thomas supported Rufus despite a rebellion led by his old mentor Odo of Bayeux, and the Archbishop accompanied the King on his campaigns to put down the revolt. Thomas attended the subsequent trial for rebellion in 1088 of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham, who had sided with Odo. William was Thomas' sole suffragan bishop, but it was Thomas who pronounced the sentence of the court.\n\nIn 1092 and again in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced, when Thomas complained about what he felt were infringements of York's rights. The first of these occasions was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury. Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter was referred to as Primate of England. The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury. The medieval chronicler Eadmer, Anselm's biographer and a Canterbury partisan, says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate. Hugh the Chanter, who was a member of the York community, stated that the metropolitan title was used. Modern historical opinion is divided, with Frank Barlow, author of \"The English Church 1066–1154\" inclined towards the primatial title, but with Richard Southern, in his biography of Anselm, leaning towards the metropolitan title. The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty, with both sides presenting biased accounts.\n\nHerbert de Losinga was appointed a papal legate in 1093 by Pope Urban II to investigate the matter of Thomas' profession of obedience to Lanfranc. Herbert seems to have done nothing about investigating the issue. Also in 1093, King William II gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the Abbot of Selby Abbey in compensation for the loss of York's claim to the Diocese of Lincoln. While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097, Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich, Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester, and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor, an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury's province, and it was Anselm's right to consecrate the new bishops. In 1100 after the sudden death of King William II and the seizure of power by the King's younger brother Henry, Thomas arrived in London too late to crown Henry I, as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice, Bishop of London, in the absence of both archbishops. Anselm at this time was still in exile. Thomas was initially angry at the slight, until it was explained to him that the King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay. To mollify him, Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation.\n\nThomas died at York on 18 November 1100. He was considered to have been an excellent archbishop, and ensured his cathedral clergy were well cared for. He repaired the cathedral and did much to promote trade in the city of York. Thomas also helped to advance the careers of his family; one of his nephews, Thomas II of York, became Archbishop of York in 1108, and another, Richard, became Bishop of Bayeux in 1107.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Thomas was praised for his learning, his encouragement of education in his diocese, and his generosity. He was an excellent singer and composed hymns. In his youth, he was known for having a sturdy build, and in his old age he had a ruddy complexion and snow white hair.\n\nThomas composed the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror's tomb in St. Etienne in Caen, but the chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition. Thomas did not concern himself with the church–state issues surrounding the Investiture Crisis, but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert primacy over the whole of England. Later authors, including William of Malmesbury and Hugh the Chantor, praised Thomas for his generosity, chastity, elegance, and charm.\n\n"}

He was a royal chaplain, and then Provost of Beverley Minster in 1092, both appointments he owed to his uncle. He was raised in the cathedral chapter at York, and the clergy of York trusted him, and he proved himself devoted to York's cause against the primacy of Canterbury. Thomas' brother Richard became Bishop of Bayeux in about 1108 until Richard's death in 1133. Thomas and Richard's sister, Isabelle of Douvres, was the mistress of Robert of Gloucester, and their son Richard was Bishop of Bayeux from 1135 to 1142.\n\nThomas became archbishop in May 1108 at the request of the dean and cathedral chapter of York. Because he refused to profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, his consecration was delayed and formed part of the Canterbury-York dispute. Thomas said that the chapter would not allow him to make a written profession, and the chapter wrote as a body to Archbishop Anselm confirming this. Meanwhile, the dean of York went to Rome to procure the pallium for Thomas, which was sent with a papal legate. Anselm died in April 1109 without any resolution to the dispute between the two archbishops. Anselm had told the bishops before his death that he felt that Thomas must make a profession of obedience, and obediently the bishops appealed to the king's court to make Thomas do so. Henry I and his bishops finally decided against Thomas, who capitulated and was consecrated in London on 27 June 1109 by Richard de Beaumis, Bishop of London. He received his pallium from Cardinal Ulrich, the legate, on 1 August 1109.\n\nThomas worked to extend York's metropolitan authority over Scotland, and consecrated Michael of Glasgow as Bishop of Glasgow. Michael made a written profession of obedience to York before his consecration. Thomas also consecrated Thurgot as Bishop of St Andrews, although Thurgot seems to have managed to insert a reservation of his rights into his oath. Other Scottish bishops he consecrated were Radulf Novell as Bishop of Orkney and Wimund to as Bishop of Man and the Isles.\n\nIn the diocese of York, the archbishop founded the Hospital of St. John the Baptist at Ripon. He also created more prebends in his diocese, extending the work of his two predecessors in introducing the Norman system of ecclesiastical government. He is said have only been stopped from appropriating the relics of Saint Eata by a vision of the saint. He also endowed the Augustinian priory of Hexham with lands and books. He had helped found the priory at Hexham when he expelled the hereditary priest from the church and settled canons there from Huntingdon.\n\nThomas died at Beverley on 24 February 1114. He was noted for his chastity, but equally noted for his gluttony, and died of overeating. Thomas was buried in York Minster near his uncle. Hugh the Chantor relates the story that Thomas one time when ill was told by his doctors that he would only be cured by sexual intercourse with a young girl. Some of Thomas' friends then attempted to introduce a young woman into his household, but Thomas instead prayed to a saint, John of Beverley, and recovered.\n\n"}

There she met Nick Christian Sayer, who became her boyfriend and musical collaborator. Sayer and James moved to London, where they teamed up with friends Dave Parsons, Tex Axile and Pol Burton, with whom they formed the pop-punk band, Transvision Vamp. James was the lead singer and focal point of the group, and attracted media attention with her sexually charged and rebellious image.\n\nThe band was signed by MCA in December 1986 and released a cover version of the Holly and the Italians song \"Tell That Girl to Shut Up\" in late 1987. Months later the follow-up single \"I Want Your Love\", with its pop/punk crossover appeal, entered the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. The band went on to release the hit album \"Pop Art\" in October. 1989 was the band's most successful year, with the number 3 hit single \"Baby I Don't Care\" and hit album \"Velveteen\" which entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and was a hit worldwide. \n\nWhen the decision had been made for Transvision Vamp to split, James wrote to Elvis Costello asking for his guidance. In response Costello, collaborating with his then wife Cait O'Riordan on some songs, wrote a full album's worth of material for James. These songs made up the tracks on her 1993 solo album \"Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears\". Produced by Chris Kimsey, it reached No. 43 in the UK Albums Chart in March 1993. However the album failed to sell in significant numbers, and James \"dropped from the music scene\".

He successfully defended poor people, labor unions, and opposition groups in the 1980s. Garlawolu passed the Bar Examinations, and was admitted to the Supreme Court Bar in 1983.\n\nHe holds several awards including the Albent Award for the democratization of Liberian society. In 1984, Garlawolu served as a Deputy Trial Counsel of the Supreme Military Tribunal with the rank of Captain. \nIn 1990, when the Country was divided by the Civil war, Garlawolu founded a national movement for the protection of civilian rights. This organization was known as the concerned citizen movement of Liberia. He was its National Chairman.\n\nHe attended all the peace conferences from Africa to Europe, which led to the formation of a government of National Unity, in which he became the first Attorney General and Minister of Justice in 1996.\n\nIn 1997, he was elected as Senior Senator of Bong County and chaired the Senate Standing Committee on Judiciary & Human Rights. Following the dethroning of the Taylor-led-government, Garlawolu was unanimously elected as member of the National Transitional Legislative Assembly in 2003. \nGarlawolu was unanimously elected by his Colleagues to chair the Judiciary Committee - which Committee he still chairs.\n\nGarlawolu is a member of the International Criminal Law Network based in The Hague with the rights of a defense Counsel. He is accredited to practice before the International Criminal Court & International Court of Justice.\n\nIn 2003, Garlawolu filed a case on behalf of the Liberian Government against the Government of Sierra Leone before the International Court of Justice. He also represented ex-president Charles G. Taylor before the Special Court in Sierra Leone. He has represented Charles Taylor's wife in divorce proceedings.\n\nGarlawolu takes credit for building schools, a clinic, and a church in Bong County. He is married to Mrs. Serena F.

Mrs. Garlawolu, a Senior Student at the Louis Author Grimes School of Law, University of Liberia, is the Consul General for South Korea in Liberia.\n\nGarlawolu is the author of two books: \"The Liberian Civil War and Efforts for Peace\" and \"The Abandoned Child.\" The latter is used as literature for the 9th grade class of the Liberian School System.\n\nGarlawolu, as a Constitutional Lawyer, represented the Grand Coalition of political parties before the Supreme Court of Liberia in 1986. The Grand Coalition was founded by five political parties against the then ruling party, the National Democratic Party of Liberia. Upon hearing that the Coalition had scheduled a mass Rally at the Coconut Plantation Beach of Monrovia, the Government of Liberia filed a petition for a writ of prohibition against the holding of the rally.

{"id": "2196198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196198", "title": "Liver dialysis", "text": "Liver dialysis\n\nLiver dialysis is a detoxification treatment for liver failure and has shown promise for patients with hepatorenal syndrome. It is similar to hemodialysis and based on the same principles. Like a bioartificial liver device, it is a form of artificial extracorporeal liver support.\nA critical issue of the clinical syndrome in liver failure is the accumulation of toxins not cleared by the failing liver. Based on this hypothesis, the removal of lipophilic, albumin-bound substances such as bilirubin, bile acids, metabolites of aromatic amino acids, medium-chain fatty acids and cytokines should be beneficial to the clinical course of a patient in liver failure. This led to the development of artificial filtration and absorption devices.\n\nHemodialysis is used for kidney failure and primarily removes water-soluble toxins. However, it does not remove toxins bound to albumin that accumulate in liver failure.\n\nLiver dialysis is performed by physicians and surgeons and specialized nurses with training in gastroenterological medicine and surgery, namely, in hepatology, the study of the liver, alongside their colleagues in the intensive or critical care unit and the transplantation department, which is responsible for procuring and implanting a new liver, or a part (lobe) of one, if and when it becomes available in time and the patient is eligible. Because of the need for these experts, as well as the relative newness of the procedure in certain areas, it is usually available only in larger hospitals, such as level I trauma center teaching hospitals connected with medical schools.\n\nWhile the technique is in its infancy, the prognosis of patients with liver failure remains guarded. Liver dialysis, currently, is only considered to be a bridge to transplantation or liver regeneration (in the case of acute liver failure) and, unlike kidney dialysis (for kidney failure), cannot support a patient for an extended period of time (months to years).\n\nArtificial detoxification devices currently under clinical evaluation include the Single Pass Albumin Dialysis (SPAD), Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS)®, Prometheus system, and Dialive.\n\nSingle pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) is a simple method of albumin dialysis using standard renal replacement therapy machines without an additional perfusion pump system: The patient's blood flows through a circuit with a high-flux hollow fiber hemodiafilter, identical to that used in the MARS system. The other side of this membrane is cleansed with an albumin solution in counter-directional flow, which is discarded after passing the filter. Hemodialysis can be performed in the first circuit via the same high-flux hollow fibers.\n\nThe Molecular Adsorbents Recirculation System (MARS) is the best known extracorporal liver dialysis system and has existed for approximately fifteen years. It consists of two separate dialysis circuits. The first circuit consists of human serum albumin, is in contact with the patient's blood through a semipermeable membrane and has two filters to clean the albumin after it has absorbed toxins from the patient's blood. The second circuit consists of a hemodialysis machine and is used to clean the albumin in the first circuit, before it is recirculated to the semipermeable membrane in contact with the patient's blood.\n\nSPAD, MARS and continuous veno-venous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) were compared in vitro with regard to detoxification capacity. SPAD and CVVHDF showed a significantly greater reduction of ammonia compared with MARS. No significant differences could be observed between SPAD, MARS and CVVHDF concerning other water-soluble substances. However, SPAD enabled a significantly greater bilirubin reduction than MARS. Bilirubin serves as an important marker substance for albumin-bound (non-water-soluble) substances. Concerning the reduction of bile acids no significant differences between SPAD and MARS were seen. It was concluded that the detoxification capacity of SPAD is similar or even higher when compared with the more sophisticated, more complex and hence more expensive MARS.\n\nAs albumin dialysis is a costly procedure, financial aspects are important: For a seven-hour treatment with MARS, approximately €300 for 600 ml human serum albumin solution (20%), €1740 for a MARS treatment kit, and €125 for disposables used by the dialysis machine have to be spent. The cost of this therapy adds up to approximately €2165. Performing SPAD according to the protocol by Sauer et al., however, requires 1000 ml of human albumin solution (20%) at a cost of €500. A high-flux dialyzer costing approximately €40 and the tubings (€125) must also be purchased. The overall costs of a SPAD treatment is approximately €656—30% of the costs of an equally efficient MARS therapy session. The expenditure for the MARS monitor necessary to operate the MARS disposables is not included in this calculation.\n\nThe Prometheus system (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) is a device based on the combination of albumin adsorption with high-flux hemodialysis after selective filtration of the albumin fraction through a specific polysulfon filter (AlbuFlow). It has been studied in a group of eleven patients with hepatorenal syndrome (acute-on-chronic liver failure and accompanying kidney failure). The treatment for two consecutive days for more than four hours significantly improved serum levels of conjugated bilirubin, bile acids, ammonia, cholinesterase, creatinine, urea and blood pH. Prometheus was proven to be a safe supportive therapy for patients with liver failure.\n\nDialive (Yaqrit Limited, London, UK) incorporates albumin removal and replacement and, endotoxin removal. It is at \"Technology readiness level\" (TRL) 5, which means it is validated in the disease environment.\n\n\n"}

The name is Italian for \"donkey-inhabited\", but it is thought to derive from the Latin \"sinuaria\", and meaning sinus-shaped. The island is virtually uninhabited. The census of population of 2001 lists one man. The island is located off the north-western tip of Sardinia, and is mountainous in geography with steep, rocky coasts. Because fresh water is scarce, trees are sparse and low scrub is the predominant vegetation. Part of the national parks system of Italy, the island was recently converted to a wildlife and marine preserve. It is home to a population of wild Albino donkeys from which the island may take its name.\n\nAsinara is located at the north-western tip of Sardinia. It is a territory of with a length of and a width which ranges from at Cala di Sgombro to of the northern part, as well as of coast length. The highest point, at , is Punta della Scomunica. The territory is entirely state property. The island is formed by four mountainous sections linked by a narrow, flat coastal belt. The windswept west coast is steep and rocky with a very deep sea bottom. The west coast turns down towards the bay of Asinara.\n\nAs an extension of the larger island, Asinara is the second largest island after Sant'Antioco. The surface is hilly, covered by thick Mediterranean scrub and few trees, with the exception of a wooded area in the northern part of the island. In the other parts of the island only small trees survive, mostly junipers. The island has indented coast, as seen from Cape Falcone. The west side of the island is more rocky and steep, while the east has wide, flat areas with a maximum height of . There are only three sandy beaches, all on the eastern coast. , of the surrounding marine and underwater environment is a protected natural area. From a geological point of view, the Asinara is part of the Nurra of north-western Sardinia, made up by more than 80 percent of metamorphic rock. The rock characterizes the island landscape together with the woody vegetation. Among the metamorphic rocks, great interest is attached to rare black Hercynean amphibolites 950 million years old, the oldest rocks in Italy.\n\nHuman habitation on the island dates back to the Neolithic Age, with Domus de Janas (sprites' houses) near Campu Perdu. Carved into soft limestone, the constructions are unique to the island.\n\nBecause of its central position in the Mediterranean, Asinara was known and used by Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans. The Camaldolite monastery of Sant'Andrea and the Castellaccio on Punta Maestra, Fornelli, may date to the Middle Ages.\nThe island was also an object of pirate raids by the Saracens. Later, ownership of Asinara was contested between Pisa, the Republic of Genoa, and the kingdom of Aragon. From the 17th century, shepherds from Sardinia and Liguria colonized the island. In 1721, it became property of the Savoy Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\nIn 1885 the island became state property; a lazaretto, the Primario Lazzaretto del Regno d'Italia, was built at Cala Reale and an agricultural penal colony was established at Cala d'Oliva, by order of King Umberto I of Italy. About 100 families of Sardinian farmers and Genoese fishermen who lived on Asinara were obliged to move to Sardinia, where they founded the village of Stintino.\n\nDuring the First World War, the island was used as a prison camp for some 24,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers, 5,000 of whom died during their imprisonment. It was used as a place of detention for Ethiopian POWs during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Majority of the Ethiopians kept there were members of the Ethiopian nobility.\n\nIn the 1970s the prison facilities were refurbished as a maximum security prison. In past years was assigned mainly to detention of mafia members and terrorists, and has housed the likes of such as the mafia boss Totò Riina. Prisoners and warders were the only inhabitants of Asinara for about 110 years, until the closure of the prison in December 1997.\n\nConstruction on the island has been forbidden for the last century.\n\nIn 1997 Asinara was established as a National Park, and is now a nature reserve. Its natural beauty, unspoiled by the sparse human settlement, made it an ideal candidate.\n\nSince 1999, tourists have been able to visit Asinara Island, but only through organized and guided tours. Swimming is permitted only on three beaches and docking of private boats is forbidden.\n\nIn 2002, the waters offshore of the national park were zoned and designated as Italy's newest marine protected area, encompassing of coastline around the island and of its coastal waters. There are two no access, no fishing zones on Asinara Island.\n\nThere are many species of native and introduced mammals on the island, including horses, asses, goats, sheep, and pigs. The island's vegetation is a mix of plants native to Sardinia, plants common throughout the Mediterranean, or introduced plants found in other bioregions, including North America. The island also harbors several rarely seen species, including the white Asinara donkey.\n\nThere are many old facilities on the island, including the prison facilities, but also small cities built for and by the inhabitants of the quarantine camp, and for the staff that serviced the camp and the prison. All of these have been turned over to the national park, and in tandem the marine protected area, who sorted out what will be kept and with what restoration is needed.\n\nA Presidential Decree, on 3 October 2002, officially set both the Park and the Park body, which is a management body envisioned for national parks by a framework on protected areas. The park body will also manage the Protected Marine Area set by decree of the Minister of the environment and land protection on 13 August 2002. Both the park and the marine area are enclosed in the protected area \"international cetacean sanctuary\"(Act. 391/01). Asinara is furthermore a Site of Community importance.(on 3 April 2000).\nThere are strict regulations on the island put in place to guarantee the conservation of the marine and land habitats. Institutional decrees (M.D. 28.11.97, M.D. 13.8.02, Presidential Decree 3.10.02), with numerous clauses, include no permission to use own vehicles, prohibition of sport fishing, anchorage and navigation with the exception of authorized means.\n\nThe vegetation of Asinara is a typical Mediterranean macchia, with lentisk, \"Euphorbia\", tree heath (\"Erica arborea\"), \"Calicotome spinosa\", \"Phillyrea angustifolia\", Phoenician juniper and cistus. The flora consists of 678 species, 29 of which are endemic. Some, such as \"Centaurea horrida\", \"Limonium laetum\" and \"Limonium acutifolium\", are exclusive to northern Sardinia, while others are characteristic of the Sardinian – Corsican region. The fauna numbers around 80 wild species of terrestrial vertebrates, including mouflon, wild boar, horses, Sardinian donkeys and the white Asinara donkey, which was introduced onto the island at the beginning of the 1800s, and probably abandoned when the inhabitants were moved to Stintino. Birds include the rare Audouin's gull, cormorants, peregrine falcons and the Barbary partridge. Asinara is the only place in Sardinia where the magpie is present.\n\nThe marine setting is rocky in the eastern side, with steep slopes and ravines, but mainly sandy in the western area. The shallowest part of the coast is colonized by two rare species, the red alga \"Lithophyllum lichenoides\" and the endangered giant limpet \"Patella ferruginea\". The integrity of the ecosystem is due to the history of its settlement, or rather the lack of it, that is a characteristic of the island.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2196211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196211", "title": "French Americans", "text": "French Americans\n\nFrench Americans or Franco-Americans (French: \"Franco-Américains\") are citizens or nationals of the United States who identify themselves with having full or partial French or French Canadian heritage, ethnicity, and/or ancestral ties. On the French-Canadians see French Canadian Americans.\n\nThe state with the largest proportion of people identifying as having French ancestry is Maine, while the state with the largest number of people with French ancestry is California. Many U.S. cities have large French American populations. The city with the largest concentration of people of French extraction is Madawaska, Maine, while the largest French-speaking population by percentage of speakers in the U.S. is found in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana.\n\nCountry-wide, there are about 10.4 million U.S. residents who declare French ancestry or French Canadian descent, and about 1.32 million speak French at home as of 2010 census. An additional 750,000 U.S. residents speak a French-based creole language, according to the 2011 American Community Survey.\n\nWhile Americans of French descent make up a substantial percentage of the American population, Franco-Americans are less visible than other similarly sized ethnic groups. This is in part due to the tendency of Franco-American groups to identify more closely with North American regional identities such as French Canadian, Acadian, Brayon, Cajuns or Louisiana Creole than as a coherent group. This has inhibited the development of a unified French American identity as is the case with other European Americans ethnic groups.\n\nSome Franco-Americans arrived prior to the founding of the United States, settling in places like the Midwest, Louisiana or Northern New England. In these same areas, many cities and geographic features retain their names given by the first Franco-American inhabitants, and in sum, 23 of the Contiguous United States were colonized in part by French pioneers or French Canadians, including settlements such as Iowa (Des Moines), Missouri (St. Louis), Kentucky (Louisville) and Michigan (Detroit), among others.\nWhile found throughout the country, today Franco-Americans are most numerous in New England, northern New York, the Midwest and Louisiana. Often, Franco-Americans are identified more specifically as being of French Canadians, Cajuns or Louisiana Creole descent.\n\nA vital segment of Franco-American history involves the Quebec diaspora of the 1840s-1930s, in which nearly one million French Canadians moved to the United States, mainly relocating to New England mill towns, fleeing economic downturn in Québec and seeking manufacturing jobs in the United States.\nHistorically, French Canadians had among the highest birth rates in world history, explaining their relatively large population despite low immigration rates from France. These immigrants mainly settled in Québec and Acadia, although some eventually inhabited Ontario and Manitoba. Many of the first French-Canadian migrants to the U.S. worked in the New England lumber industry, and, to a lesser degree, in the burgeoning mining industry in the upper Great Lakes. This initial wave of seasonal migration was then followed by more permanent relocation in the United States by French-Canadian millworkers.\n\nLouisiana Creole people refers to those who are descended from the colonial settlers in Louisiana, especially those of French and Spanish descent. The term is now commonly applied to individuals of mixed-race heritage. Both groups have common European heritage and share cultural ties, such as the traditional use of the French language and the continuing practice of Catholicism; in most cases, the people are related to each other. Those of mixed race also sometimes have African and Native American ancestry. As a group, the mixed-race Creoles rapidly began to acquire education, skills (many in New Orleans worked as craftsmen and artisans), businesses and property. They were overwhelmingly Catholic, spoke Colonial French (although some also spoke Louisiana Creole French), and kept up many French social customs, modified by other parts of their ancestry and Louisiana culture. The free people of color married among themselves to maintain their class and social culture. The French-speaking mixed-race population came to be called \"Creoles of color\".\n\nThe Cajuns of Louisiana have a unique heritage. Their ancestors settled Acadia, in what is now the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and part of Maine in the 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1755, after capturing Fort Beauséjour in the region, the British Army forced the Acadians to either swear an oath of loyalty to the British Crown or face expulsion. Thousands refused to take the oath, causing them to be sent, penniless, to the 13 colonies to the south in what has become known as the Great Upheaval. Over the next generation, some four thousand managed to make the long trek to Louisiana, where they began a new life. The name \"Cajun\" is a corruption of the word \"Acadian\". Many still live in what is known as the Cajun Country, where much of their colonial culture survives. French Louisiana, when it was sold by Napoleon in 1803, covered all or part of fifteen current U.S. states and contained French and Canadian colonists dispersed across it, though they were most numerous in its southernmost portion.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Louisiana residents of French origin took part on the American side in the Battle of New Orleans (December 23, 1814, through January 8, 1815). Jean Lafitte and his Baratarians later were honored by US General Andrew Jackson for their contribution to the defense of New Orleans.\n\nIn Louisiana today, more than 15 percent of the population of the Cajun Country reported in the 2000 United States Census that French was spoken at home.\n\nAnother significant source of immigrants to Louisiana was Saint-Domingue, which gained its independence as the Republic of Haiti in 1804, following Haitian Revolution; much of its white population (along with some mulattoes) fled during this time, often to New Orleans.\n\nBiloxi in Mississippi, and Mobile in Alabama, still contain French American heritage since they were founded by the Canadian Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.\n\nThe Houma Tribe in Louisiana still speak the same French they had been taught 300 years ago.\n\nIn the 17th and early 18th centuries there was an influx of a few thousand Huguenots, who were Calvinist refugees fleeing religious persecution following the issuance of the 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau by Louis XIV of the Kingdom of France. For nearly a century they fostered a distinctive French Protestant identity that enabled them to remain aloof from American society, but by the time of the American Revolution they had generally intermarried and merged into the larger Presbyterian community. In 1700, they constituted 13 percent of the white population of the Province of Carolina and 5 percent of the white population of the Province of New York. The largest number settling in South Carolina, where the French comprised four percent of the white population in 1790. With the help of the well organized international Huguenot community, many also moved to Virginia. In the north, Paul Revere of Boston was a prominent figure.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 17th century, French Canadians explored and traveled to the region with their coureur de bois and explorers, such as Jean Nicolet, Robert de LaSalle, Jacques Marquette, Nicholas Perrot, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, Pierre Dugué de Boisbriant, Lucien Galtier, Pierre Laclède, René Auguste Chouteau, Julien Dubuque, Pierre de La Vérendrye and Pierre Parrant.\nThe French Canadians set up a number of villages along the waterways, including Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; La Baye, Wisconsin; Cahokia, Illinois; Kaskaskia, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan; Saint Ignace, Michigan; Vincennes, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; and Sainte Genevieve, Missouri. They also built a series of forts in the area, such as Fort de Chartres, Fort Crevecoeur, Fort Saint Louis, Fort Ouiatenon, Fort Miami (Michigan), Fort Miami (Indiana), Fort Saint Joseph, Fort La Baye, Fort de Buade, Fort Saint Antoine, Fort Crevecoeur, Fort Trempealeau, Fort Beauharnois, Fort Orleans, Fort St. Charles, Fort Kaministiquia, Fort Michilimackinac, Fort Rouillé, Fort Niagara, Fort Le Boeuf, Fort Venango and Fort Duquesne. The forts were serviced by soldiers and fur trappers who had long networks reaching through the Great Lakes back to Montreal. Sizable agricultural settlements were established in the \"Pays des Illinois.\"\n\nThe region was relinquished by France to the British in 1763 as a result of the Treaty of Paris. Three years of war by the Natives, called Pontiac's War, ensued. It became part of the Province of Quebec in 1774, and was seized by the United States during the Revolution.\n\nIn the late 19th century, many Francophones arrived in New England from Quebec and New Brunswick to work in textile mill cities in New England. In the same period, Francophones from Quebec soon became a majority of the workers in the saw mill and logging camps in the Adirondack Mountains and their foothills. Others sought opportunities for farming and other trades such as blacksmiths in Northern New York State. By the mid-20th century Franco-Americans comprised 30 percent of Maine's population. Some migrants became lumberjacks but most concentrated in industrialized areas and into enclaves known as \"Little Canadas\".\nFrench Canadian women saw New England as a place of opportunity and possibility where they could create economic alternatives for themselves distinct from the expectations of their farm families in Canada. By the early 20th century some saw temporary migration to the United States to work as a rite of passage and a time of self-discovery and self-reliance. Most moved permanently to the United States, using the inexpensive railroad system to visit Quebec from time to time. When these women did marry, they had fewer children with longer intervals between children than their Canadian counterparts. Some women never married, and oral accounts suggest that self-reliance and economic independence were important reasons for choosing work over marriage and motherhood. These women conformed to traditional gender ideals in order to retain their 'Canadienne' cultural identity, but they also redefined these roles in ways that provided them increased independence in their roles as wives and mothers.\nThe Franco-Americans became active in the Catholic Church where they tried with little success to challenge its domination by Irish clerics. They founded such newspapers as \"Le Messager\" and \"La Justice\". The first hospital in Lewiston, Maine, became a reality in 1889 when the Sisters of Charity of Montreal, the 'Grey Nuns,' opened the doors of the Asylum of Our Lady of Lourdes. This hospital was central to the Grey Nuns' mission of providing social services for Lewiston's predominately French Canadian mill workers. The Grey Nuns struggled to establish their institution despite meager financial resources, language barriers, and opposition from the established medical community. Immigration dwindled after World War I.\n\nThe French Canadian community in New England tried to preserve some of its cultural norms. This doctrine, like efforts to preserve francophone culture in Quebec, became known as \"la Survivance\". A product of the industrial economy of the regions at the time, by 1913, the French and French-Canadian populations of New York City, Fall River, Massachusetts and Manchester, New Hampshire were the largest in the country, and out of the top 20 largest Franco-American populations in the United States, only 4 were outside of New York and New England, with New Orleans ranking 18th largest in the nation. Because of this, a number of French institutions were established in New England, including the Société Historique Franco-américaine in Boston, and the Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste d’Amérique of Woonsocket, the largest French-Catholic cultural and benefit society in the United States in the early 20th century.\n\nPotvin (2003) has studied the evolution of French Catholic parishes in New England. The predominantly Irish hierarchy of the 19th century was slow to recognize the need for French-language parishes; several bishops even called for assimilation and English language-only parochial schools. By the 20th century, a number of parochial schools for Francophone students opened, though they gradually closed toward the end of the century and a large share of the French-speaking population left the Church. At the same time, the number of priests available to staff these parishes also diminished.\n\nBy the 21st century the emphasis was on retaining local reminders of French American culture rather than on retaining the language itself. With the decline of the state's textile industry during the 1950s, the French element experienced a period of upward mobility and assimilation. This pattern of assimilation increased during the 1970s and 1980s as many Catholic organizations switched to English names and parish children entered public schools; some parochial schools closed in the 1970s. Although some ties to its French Canadian origins remain, the community was largely anglicized by the 1990s, moving almost completely from 'Canadien' to 'American'.\n\nNoted American popular culture figures who maintained a close connection to their French roots include musician Rudy Vallée (1901–1986) who grew up in Westbrook, Maine, a child of a French-Canadian father and an Irish mother, and counter-culture author Jack Kerouac (1922-1969) who grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts. Kerouac was the child of two French-Canadian immigrants, and wrote in both English and French. Franco-American politicians from New England include U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R, New Hampshire) and Presidential adviser Jon Favreau, who was born and raised in Massachusetts.\n\nFranco-Americans in the Union forces were one of the most important Catholic groups present during the American Civil War. The exact number is unclear, but thousands of Franco-Americans appear to have served in this conflict. Union forces did not keep reliable statistics concerning foreign enlistments. However, historians have estimated anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000 Franco-Americans serving in this war. In addition to those born in the United States, many who served in the Union forces came from Canada or had resided there for several years. Canada's national anthem was written by such a soldier named Calixa Lavallée, who wrote this anthem while he served for the Union, attaining the rank of Lieutenant. Leading Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard was a noted French American from Louisiana.\n\nWalker (1962) examines the voting behavior in U.S. presidential elections from 1880 to 1960, using election returns from 30 Franco-American communities in New England, along with sample survey data for the 1948-60 elections. From 1896 to 1924, Franco-Americans typically supported the Republican Party because of its conservatism, emphasis on order, and advocacy of the tariff to protect the textile workers from foreign competition. In 1928, with Catholic Al Smith as the Democratic candidate, the Franco-Americans moved over to the Democratic column and stayed there for six presidential elections. They formed part of the New Deal Coalition. Unlike the Irish and German Catholics, very few Franco-Americans deserted the Democratic ranks because of the foreign policy and war issues of the 1940 and 1944 campaigns. In 1952 many Franco-Americans broke from the Democrats but returned heavily in 1960.\n\nAs the ancestors of most Franco-Americans had for the most part left France before the French Revolution, they usually prefer the Fleur-de-lis to the modern French tricolor.\n\nIn 2008, the state of Connecticut made June 24 Franco-American Day, recognizing French Canadians for their culture and influence on Connecticut. The states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, have now also held Franco-American Day festivals on June 24.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau of 2000, 5.3 percent of Americans are of French or French Canadian ancestry. In 2013 the number of people living in the US who were born in France was estimated at 129,520. Franco-Americans made up close to, or more than, 10 percent of the population of seven states, six in New England and Louisiana. Population wise, California has the greatest Franco population followed by Louisiana, while Maine has the highest by percentage (25 percent).\n\nBetween 1820 and 1920, 530,000 French people came to the United States\n\nMost Franco Americans have a Roman Catholic heritage (which includes most French Canadians and Cajuns). Protestants would arrive in two smaller waves, with the earliest arrivals being the Huguenots who fled from France in the colonial era, many of whom would settle in Boston, Charleston, New York, and Philadelphia. Huguenots and their descendants would immigrate to the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Provinces of Pennsylvania and Carolina due in large part to colonial anti-Catholic sentiment, during the period of the Edict of Fontainebleau. The 19th century would see the arrival of others from Switzerland. \n\nFrom the 1870s to the 1920s in particular, there was tension between the English-speaking Irish Catholics, who dominated the Church in New England, and the French immigrants, who wanted their language taught in the parochial schools. The Irish controlled all the Catholic colleges in New England, except for Assumption College in Massachusetts, controlled by the French, and one school in New Hampshire controlled by Germans. Tensions between these two groups bubbled up in Fall River in 1884-1886, in Danielson, Connecticut and North Brookfield, Massachusetts in the 1890s, and in Maine in the subsequent decades. A breaking point was reached during the Sentinelle affair of the 1920s, in which Franco-American Catholics of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, challenged their bishop over control of parish funds in an unsuccessful bid to wrest power from the Irish American episcopate. In a 1957 treatise on urban history, American historian Constance Green would attribute some disputes between French and Irish Catholics in Massachusetts, Holyoke in particular, as fomented by Yankee English Protestants, in the hopes that a split would diminish Catholic influence.\n\nMarie Rose Ferron was a mystic stigmatic; she was born in Quebec and lived in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Between about 1925 and 1936, she was a popular \"victim soul\" who suffered physically to redeem the sins of her community. Father Onésime Boyer promoted her cult.\n\nCurrently there are multiple French international schools in the United States operated in conjunction with the Agency for French Education Abroad (AEFE).\n\nAccording to the National Education Bureau, French is the second most commonly taught foreign language in American schools, behind Spanish. The percentage of people who learn French language in the United States is 12.3%. French was the most commonly taught foreign language until the 1980s; when the influx of Hispanic immigrants aided the growth of Spanish. According to the U.S. 2000 Census, French is the third most spoken language in the United States after English and Spanish, with 2,097,206 speakers, up from 1,930,404 in 1990. The language is also commonly spoken by Haitian immigrants in Florida and New York City.\n\nAs a result of French immigration to what is now the United States in the 17th and 18th centuries, the French language was once widely spoken in a few dozen scattered villages in the Midwest. Migrants from Quebec after 1860 brought the language to New England. French-language newspapers existed in many American cities; especially New Orleans and in certain cities in New England. Americans of French descent often lived in predominantly French neighborhoods; where they attended schools and churches that used their language. Before 1920 French Canadian neighborhoods were sometimes known as \"Little Canada\".\n\nAfter 1960, the \"Little Canadas\" faded away. There were few French-language institutions other than Catholic churches. There were some French newspapers, but they had a total of only 50,000 subscribers in 1935. The World War II generation avoided bilingual education for their children, and insisted they speak English. By 1976, nine in ten Franco Americans usually spoke English and scholars generally agreed that \"the younger generation of Franco-American youth had rejected their heritage.\"\n\n\n\nRichard (2002) examines the major trends in the historiography regarding the Franco-Americans who came to New England in 1860–1930. He identifies three categories of scholars: survivalists, who emphasized the common destiny of Franco-Americans and celebrated their survival; regionalists and social historians, who aimed to uncover the diversity of the Franco-American past in distinctive communities across New England; and pragmatists, who argued that the forces of acculturation were too strong for the Franco-American community to overcome. The 'pragmatists versus survivalists' debate over the fate of the Franco-American community may be the ultimate weakness of Franco-American historiography. Such teleological stances have impeded the progress of research by funneling scholarly energies in limited directions while many other avenues, for example, Franco-American politics, arts, and ties to Quebec, remain insufficiently explored.\n\nWhile a considerable number of pioneers of Franco-American history left the field or came to the end of their careers in the late 1990s, other scholars have moved the lines of debate in new directions in the last fifteen years. The \"Franco\" communities of New England have received less sustained scholarly attention in this period, but important work has no less appeared as historians have sought to assert the relevance of the French-Canadian diaspora to the larger narratives of American immigration, labor, and religious history.\n\nScholars have worked to expand the transnational perspective developed by Robert G. LeBlanc during the 1980s and 1990s. Yukari Takai has studied the impact of recurrent cross-border migration on family formation and gender roles among Franco-Americans. Florence Mae Waldron has expanded on older work by Tamara Hareven and Randolph Langenbach in her study of Franco-American women's work within prevalent American gender norms. Waldron's innovative work on the national aspirations and agency of women religious in New England also merits mention. Historians have pushed the lines of inquiry on Franco-Americans of New England in other directions as well. Recent studies have introduced a comparative perspective, considered the surprisingly understudied 1920s and 1930s, and reconsidered old debates on assimilation and religious conflict in light of new sources.\n\nAt the same time, there has been rapidly expanding research on the French presence in the middle and western part of the continent (the American Midwest, the Pacific coast, and the Great Lakes region) in the century following the collapse of New France.\n\n\n\n"}

Each was different, as they were intended as showcases for his patents rather than for serious production.\n\nThe cars incorporated such features as independent suspension, hydraulic brakes, a heater and all seating within the wheelbase. Ignition and other controls operated through flexible cables encased in copper tubing, which followed contemporary aircraft industry practice. The cars were rear-engined with twin radiators. The first car used an Alvis front-wheel-drive chassis effectively turned back-to-front but adapted so the new front wheels steered. Later cars used Beverley straight 8, Lycoming and Armstrong Siddeley engines.\n\nThe streamlined bodywork is very long at just under . The spare wheel was carried inside one of the rear doors which must have put an enormous strain on the hinges and door pillar. The equivalent space in the opposite door was occupied either by a second spare wheel or a cocktail cabinet. The car's unusual aerodynamic design was eye catching, with very little front overhang, but a long rear overhang (containing the engine). The underside was also covered in sheet metal to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The Streamline pointed to the future in terms of space efficiency, featuring a seven-seat interior and, even by the standards of the time, excellent headroom, which seems to have been a particular concern for the designer.\n\nEach car was priced at around £1,500. A blue one was bought by the Prince of Wales late in 1930, and another crossed the Atlantic to be exhibited at the Detroit Car Show. In total, 12 Streamlines were built between 1929 and 1931, but none appears to have survived. Crossley Motors took out a licence to build the Streamline, producing a further 25 vehicles, of which two survive.\n\nThe Straight eight Beverley-Barnes engines in the earlier cars proved to be unreliable, and in the final three cars were replaced by US-built 6-cylinder Lycoming or UK-built Armstrong Siddeley units.\n\nStreamline Cars finally closed in 1936.\n\nA contemporary report commended the lack of mechanical noise from the driver's seat and the excellence of the ride. The car's considerable weight – 38 cwt or about 1900 kg on the 1930 model – may have been one cause of the clutch-slip reported at 76 mph (about 122 km/h) which was close to the car's claimed maximum. The engine was mounted wholly behind the rear axle, and the car was therefore alarmingly unstable in wet or windy weather.\n\nA remarkable turning circle of was achieved in spite of the car's length. No two Streamlines were identical and the version tested was \"only\" 18 ft 7 in (approximately 5.6 meters) long with a 12 ft 5 in (3.8 m) wheelbase which made it unwieldy in restricted spaces. It was longer than the longest available Rolls-Royce and only about £350 cheaper.\n\nSome of the ideas (including the location of the spare wheel) were used by Crossley Motors in their \"Streamline\" but this also was not a production success. The Maidenhead factory was also used for car production by Marendaz and GWK.\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2196232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196232", "title": "Arvo Ojala", "text": "Arvo Ojala\n\nArvo Ojala (February 21, 1920 in Seattle, Washington – July 1, 2005 in Gresham, Oregon) was a Hollywood technical advisor on the subject of quick-draw with a revolver. He also worked as an actor; his most famous role was that of the unnamed man shot by Marshal Matt Dillon in the opening sequences of the long-running television series \"Gunsmoke\". As a joke on the producers, James Arness and Arvo actually did the opener once with Dillon falling to the ground.\n\nBorn to Finnish immigrant parents as a young man, Ojala taught himself marksmanship and how to quick-draw a handgun while living on his father's ranch near Yakima, Washington. He said he sharpened his marksmanship skill by shooting the heads off rattlesnakes.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Ojala was living in Los Angeles, and working for the Hollywood film studios. \"I watched these guys in Westerns,\" he told a reporter in 1957, \"and realized that they were slow on the draw because the cylinder of their guns got stuck in their holsters. I decided the trick was to keep the cylinder free. I began making holsters in my garage. I lined each one with metal so a man could draw without any impediment. Then I began practicing myself. After a year or two I got it down so pat that today I can double draw in one-sixth of a second.\"\n\nOjala was \"the genuine article\" to those he tutored. His speed was clocked and verified a number of times. He could draw, fire, and hit the target in one-sixth of a second, faster than the eye can blink. His technique of cocking \"in the holster\" as he drew revolutionized the western and was shown in detail both by Henry Fonda in the western film \"The Tin Star\" and by John Payne in his series \"The Restless Gun\". At the height of the TV Westerns, Ojala opened a \"quick-draw\" studio on the 8500 block of the Sunset Strip, next to the famous King's Cellar Liquor Store.\n\nFor further proof, Arvo would drop a silver dollar with his gun hand (right) from belt height, then draw and hit the coin before it could fall four inches. This was using \"live\", or full-power ammunition, not the wax bullets and quarter-loads used today in so-called \"fast draw\" competitions. In another exhibition, his opponent (using blanks) would face him with his pistol out of the holster and cocked, then nod as he simultaneously fired his revolver, while Arvo would draw and fire before the opponent could get a shot off. He never lost.\n\nIn August 1956, Ojala filed a patent application for his low-slung, metal-lined \"Quick Draw Holster\", and in April 1958, he was granted US Patent 2832519. His holster was publicly described in the \"New York Times\" on May 3, 1958. Disputes over similar holsters made by others resulted in a published court case—California Court of Appeals, OJALA v. BOHLIN, 178 Cal.App.2d 292 (1960) Docket No. 23844, February 24, 1960.\n\nAmong the TV and film stars that Ojala taught to shoot included James Arness, Robert Culp, James Garner, Kevin Kline, Paul Newman, Hugh O'Brian, Clint Walker, Marilyn Monroe and Thomas F. Wilson. He was a close personal friend to Audie Murphy with Murphy becoming Arvo's children's Godfather. He noted that most actors in westerns had, at best, a nodding acquaintance with handguns, especially the 1873 Colt .45s widely used in television and film because of their reliability. But, a gifted teacher, he said he could teach the necessary skills to anyone in two weeks. He also had speaking roles in many television series and films, to include the 1959 film \"The Oregon Trail\", in which his expertise as a gunhandler, fastdraw artist, and instructor were shown. Usually, it was Arvo's hand that was actually shown in close-up when real speed and spinning skills were needed.\n\nHis wife Doris Severson, preceded him in death (1951 - 1978). He is survived by his children Valerie, Jon, Erikk, Inga and Kym.\n\n"}
{"id": "2196240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196240", "title": "Dove Holes", "text": "Dove Holes\n\nDove Holes is a village in the High Peak district of Derbyshire, England. It has a population of about 1,200 (2001), shown in the 2011 Census as being included in the population of Chapel-en-le-Frith. It straddles the A6 road approximately three miles north of Buxton and three miles south of Chapel-en-le-Frith. Trains run from Dove Holes railway station into Manchester.\n\nResidents of the village live either in the village or on outlying farms. There are around six farms in the village and many more within the boundaries of the parish. There are also large limestone quarries that, over the years, have made an important contribution to the development and economy of the village. Additionally, there are several businesses. There are two public houses, one of which offers accommodation. There is a daily milk delivery service and a mobile library every fortnight. There is a church, Methodist chapel and a community centre. The village lies on the fringe of the Peak District National Park.\n\nEvidence of human occupation at Dove Holes can be traced back to the Neolithic Period (late Stone Age) because of the existence of a henge, known locally as The Bull Ring, and an adjoining tumulus. In medieval times the area was used as the royal hunting Forest of High Peak (now known as Peak Forest), an area set aside as a royal hunting forest. The village's name is believed to derive from the Celtic word \"dwfr\" (dŵr in modern Welsh), which means water, hence Water Holes or Dove Holes. The same word is the origin of the name 'Dover' for the famous Channel ferryport.\n\nIn 1650, a General Survey of the Manor of High Peak was made to assess the property of the late King Charles. This recorded that people were burning limestone around the village and that there were 14 kilns thereabouts, the burnt lime (quicklime) being slaked and used by farmers to condition the soil in their fields. At that time, lime kilns could be built and demolished without authority.\n\nWith the coming of the Industrial Revolution, and the opening of the Peak Forest Tramway in 1796, the limestone quarries were commercialised. The first of these was at nearby Loads Knowl and others quickly followed along Dove Holes Dale. Undoubtedly, the opening of the Peak Forest Tramway and the consequent expansion of commercial limestone quarries contributed greatly to the expansion of the village. For the first time, there was an outlet for limestone in Manchester via the Peak Forest Tramway, Bugsworth Basin, the Peak Forest Canal and the Ashton Canal.\n\nBuxton Mountain Rescue Team has been based in Dove Holes since the 1970s. Their present base in the village was opened in 1990 by HRH Diana Princess of Wales.\n\nThere is a High Peak bus company garage on the east side of the A6, replacing the one which used to be in Buxton.\n\nIn 2001, the village was voted the ugliest village in Britain in a Radio 5 Live poll. However Dove Holes railway station (the highest in England) was chosen in 2019 to feature in the music video for the chart-topping single \"Someone You Loved\" by singer Lewis Capaldi.\n\nCemex operate a quarry in Dove Holes.\n"}

His elder brothers included Freeman Frederick Thomas, a noted cricketer, who was the father of Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon, Viceroy of India; and Sir Charles Inigo Thomas.\n\nHe was born at Ratton Park, Sussex, and educated at Haileybury College. He was intended for the Civil Service, but delicate health interfered with his studies, and in 1873 he went to Paris to cultivate the musical talent he had displayed from an early age. Here he studied for two years with Émile Durand. In 1875, he returned to England, and in 1877 entered the Royal Academy of Music, where for three years he studied under Ebenezer Prout and Arthur Sullivan, twice winning the Lucas medal for composition. At a later period he received some instruction in orchestration from Max Bruch. His first published composition was a song, \"Le Roi Henri\", which appeared in 1871.\n\nAn early comic opera, \"Don Braggadocio\" (libretto by his brother, C. I. Thomas), was apparently unfinished; some of the music in it was afterwards used for \"The Golden Web\". A selection from his second opera, \"The Light of the Harem\" (libretto by Clifford Harrison), was performed at the Royal Academy of Music on 7 November 1879, with such success that Carl Rosa commissioned him to write \"Esmeralda\" (libretto by Theophile Marzials and Alberto Randegger), dedicated to Pauline Viardot, produced at Drury Lane on 26 March 1883. (Creator cast: Georgina Burns (Esmeralda): Barton McGuckin (Phoebus): William Ludwig (Frollo): Leslie Crotty (Quasimodo): Clara Perry (Fleur-de-Lys): Leah Don (Lois): J.H. Stilliard (Chevreuse): Ben Davies (Gringoire): G.H. Snazelle (Clopin).) This contained the very successful aria \"O, vision entrancing\". Two years later the opera was given (in German) at Cologne and Hamburg, and in 1890 (in French) at Covent Garden.\n\nOn 16 April 1885, at Drury Lane, Rosa produced Thomas's fourth and best opera, \"Nadeshda\" (libretto by Julian Sturgis); a German version of which was given at Breslau in 1890. A fifth opera, \"The Golden Web\" (libretto by Frederick Corder and B. C. Stephenson), an opéra bouffe slighter than its predecessors, was produced (after the composer's death) by the Carl Rosa Opera Company at Liverpool on 15 February, and at the Lyric Theatre, London on 11 March 1893. \nIn spite of some positive critical attention, interest in the opera was short-lived.\n\nBesides these dramatic works, Thomas's chief compositions were a psalm, \"Out of the Deep\", for soprano solo and chorus (London, 1878); a choral ode, \"The Sun Worshippers\" (Norwich, 1881), and a \"suite de ballet\" for orchestra (Cambridge, 1887). A cantata, \"The Swan and the Skylark\", was found in piano score among his manuscripts after his death: it was orchestrated by Charles Villiers Stanford, and produced at the Birmingham Festival of 1894. \n\nHis minor compositions include over 100 songs and duets. In 1891 Thomas became engaged to be married; shortly afterwards he showed signs of mental disease, and his career came to a tragic end on 20 March 1892 when he committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train. He was buried in Finchley Cemetery.\n\nGoring Thomas occupies a distinct place among English composers of the 19th century. His music, which shows traces of his early French training, reveals a great talent for dramatic composition and a real gift of refined and beautiful melody. Personally the most amiable of men, he was most critical of his own work, never attempting anything for which he felt he was unfitted, and constantly revising and rewriting his compositions.\n\n"}

In fact, they are the first confirmed users of the shield wall tactic later made famous as the classical Greek phalanx and the Roman \"testudo formation\". It is unknown who first developed this tactic, but it is thought to have been developed somewhere between 2500 B.C.E and 2000 B.C.E.\n\nAnother Mesopotamian tactic involved small, well-disciplined spearman formations. Armed with javelins, they were the first effective missile troops, as shown during their war against the Hittites in around 2000 BC. These missile units were later idealized in the famous epic poem \"The Sie.\" The Mesopotamian battle formation consisted of the shield wall and short-sword armed sliders in front, and the missile troops behind, with charioteers on the flanks. These formations served the Mesopotamians well for many years, but were eventually outclassed by slingers and archers. \n\nIn each race that thrived in Mesopotamia, military and defensive tactics differed. The Sumerians invented the horse-drawn chariot with lighter wheels, allowing quick maneuvering and evasion in the battlefield. The Akkadians and Babylonians focused on their military power because of constant threats from neighboring tribes and kingdoms. \n\nAmidst all this, however, the Assyrians were one of the most successful military kingdoms. They were one of the first to produce iron weapons, which, alongside their utter ruthlessness and the aforementioned tactics, helped them succeed with campaigns in Egypt, Asia Minor, and the Levant, arguably making the Assyrians one of the best ancient empires. In fact, the Assyrians were so advanced in strategies such as siege that Anglim Wrote:\n\nIn the end, however, the Assyrians were victims of their own success, the heir(s) to the throne eventually became too incompetent to micromanage the empire, and started a civil war for control that effectively ended the Assyrian project and allowed Medes, Babylonians, and Persia to take power. \n\n"}

The plot involves a supposed curse on the Dain family, said to inflict sudden and violent deaths upon those in their vicinity. Edgar Leggett's wife is a Dain, as is his daughter Gabrielle. The detective untangles a web of robberies, lies and murder. It is discovered that Gabrielle Leggett is under the influence of a mysterious religious cult and is also addicted to morphine.\n\nGabrielle escapes from the cult and marries her fiancé Eric Collinson, but bloodshed continues to follow her. The Continental Op, on behalf of four successive clients, investigates the reason behind all the mysterious, violent events surrounding Gabrielle Leggett, which he eventually uncovers. The concluding chapters of the novel contain a detailed description of how the Op weans her from her drug habit, and the novel ends on a hopeful note.\n\nThe novel was adapted into a CBS television miniseries in 1978, by director E.W. Swackhamer and producer Martin Poll, which starred James Coburn (as the Op, given the name \"Hamilton Nash\" for this film version), Hector Elizondo (as Ben Feeney), Jean Simmons (as Aaronia Haldorn), Jason Miller (as Owen Fitzstephan), Beatrice Straight (as Alice Leggett), Paul Stewart (as the old man), Nancy Addison (as Gabrielle Leggett), Tom Bower (as Sergeant O'Gar), David Canary (as Jack Santos), Beeson Carroll (as Marshall Cotton), Roland Winters (as Hubert Collinson) and a pre-\"Star Trek\" Brent Spiner (as Tom Fink).

(1999) recognized also the following species:\n\nJapanese Red List Data Book (2006) recognizes also the following additional species:\n\nThis genus has not yet become established in the USA, but it is considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore, it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA.\n\nAbout the origin and evolution history of \"Oncomelania\", Davis (1979) proposed a Gondwanan origin for the Pomatiopsidae, with rafting to mainland Asia via the Indian Craton after break-up of Gondwanan and colonization of South-East Asia and China. It is hypothesized that \"Oncomelania\" snails, arrived in southwestern China from Indian before the second (major) Tibetan orogeny (2.5 Ma), then evolved and spread down their respective river systems, to mainland of China, Indonesia and Philippines. Although mutation rate calibrations using fossil data is impossible here, many studies have demonstrated the confidence that molecular data can provide reasonable estimates of divergence time. Data by Zhao et al. (2010) suggested that the two subspecies of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" began to diverse as early about 2–6 Ma based on the invertebrate ITS substitution rate range. Zhao et al. (2010) did not find any strong molecular and fossil evidences about \"Oncomelania\" evolution, but the reported \"Oncomelania\" fossil found in Guangxi (1 Ma) by Nils Hjalmar Odhner in 1930 and geological movement make this diversification time reasonable. It provides a new insight into the \"Oncomelania\" evolution history although the substitution rate needs to be verified with new fossil and molecular data in future study.\n\nVarious \"Oncomelania\" species are significant medically, because they can serve as vectors for two serious human diseases: they can carry the schistosomiasis blood fluke parasite, and the paragonimus lung fluke parasites.\n\nThe miracidia reproduce asexually through sporocyst stages within these intermediate hosts, resulting in the production of many free-swimming cercariae.\n\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-2.0 text from the reference and CC-BY-2.5 text from the reference\n"}

It is owned by HMV.\n\nThe company was setup by Englishman Gordon Montgomery and began as a one-man stall in Glasgow, Scotland in 1981. The name \"Fopp\" comes from the title of a song by the Ohio Players on their 1975 album \"Honey\".\n\nBy 2007, Fopp had expanded to become a chain of over 100 branches in the UK. With the demise of rival chain Music Zone, Fopp became the third largest specialist music retailer in the UK in terms of shop numbers (after HMV and Virgin Megastores).\n\nHaving taken over rival chain Music Zone following its fall into administration, Fopp found itself with cash flow problems. The company cancelled book deliveries in June blaming a change in location of warehouse from Bristol to Stockport (the old Music Zone warehouse).\n\nOn 21 June 2007, the company began accepting only cash transactions, stating card authorisation problems as the cause. On 22 June 2007 the company closed all branches for 'stocktaking' and said it was in talks with its bank. A week later the company announced a temporary closure in all its outlets and its online venture, and staff were informed that they would not be receiving their monthly pay.\n\nOn 29 June 2007, Fopp called in receivers after a last-ditch deal that would have allowed Sir Richard Branson a way to devolve himself from the loss making Virgin Megastores without the negative PR of closing down multiple locations, but this deal failed to win support from Virgin's main supplier. The shops were closed, and staff were sent home with their monthly salaries unpaid.\n\nThe Fopp website was taken down shortly afterwards and replaced with the following message:\n\nErnst & Young was appointed as joint administrator of Fopp and Music Zone, and issued a press statement detailing shops closed and the numbers of jobs lost at each location.\n\nOn 31 July 2007, it was announced that HMV would take control of the Fopp brand and its shops in Cambridge, Edinburgh Rose Street (but not Cockburn Street), Glasgow, London Covent Garden, Manchester and Nottingham. On 12 February 2008, \"Bristol Evening Post\" reported that a further shop would open in Bristol (in a former HMV-owned Waterstone's store), a city in which three Fopp shops had traded prior to summer 2007.\n\nOn 24 August 2007, the Glasgow Union Street and Edinburgh stores reopened. The Cambridge shop reopened on 25 August 2007, and the Manchester shop was relaunched on the 27th. After a statement from HMV stating that it was unable to open the Covent Garden London branch, it finally gained the landlord's consent to take over the lease and the shop reopened on 5 October 2007. Only around 10% of the original 700 employees kept their jobs.\n\nIt was also announced that the Leamington Spa shop would be reopening as Head, a separate shop from Fopp, but retaining Fopp's stock and assets. The Head shop opened on 1 November 2007 and employed some of its predecessor's former employees. The shop intends to host regular performances from local bands, and hopes to allow musicians, artists and authors from Leamington and its surrounding areas to sell their work there. This was initially a single shop, but has more recently expanded into a chain of four sites.\n\nIn 2009 the HMV shop in Exeter, Devon, was rebranded as a new Fopp shop while HMV moved to a new building in the redeveloped Princesshay Shopping Centre. Also in August 2010, HMV opened a new Fopp store on the ground floor of the Waterstone's store in Gower Street, London. On 30 January 2011, HMV closed the Fopp shop in Exeter due to poor sales in the recent reform of HMV. It was the first Fopp shop to close under the HMV banner. In January 2014, Fopp announced it would be closing the London Gower Street branch within Waterstone's on 18 January 2014, with the remaining business transferring to the Covent Garden branch.\n\nAt their peak under HMV ownership, nine shops were trading as Fopp.\n\nOn 15 January 2013 Fopp, along with its parent company HMV went into administration. HMV was bought out of administration by Hilco UK on 5 April 2013 saving Fopp's nine remaining shops.\n\nOn 28 December 2018, HMV confirmed it had again been placed into administration, which Hilco UK cited the \"tsunami\" of retail competition as the reason for the move. On 5 February 2019, Canadian record shop chain Sunrise Records announced its acquisition of HMV Retail Ltd. from Hilco UK for an undisclosed amount, but at the cost of closing 26 locations, including 4 Fopp shops, leaving only 6 shops trading under the name.\n\nThe first Fopp shop was a market stall in Decourcey's Arcade near Byres Road in Glasgow opened 1981 by Gordon Montgomery. Fopp operated a \"keep-it-simple\" approach to the pricing of its merchandise, with most prices rounded to whole-pound figures. It built a reputation for reasonable prices on new releases, and competitive prices (often £5) on non-mainstream catalogue CDs, DVDs and books. The company also had a policy called \"suck it and see\", whereby any purchase could be returned to the shop within 28 days for a full refund as long as it was as new.\n\nUntil 2007 there were 50 Fopp shops and 37 outlets branded as Music Zone throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Fopp appeared in \"The Scotsman\"'s list of the 250 Biggest Scottish Companies of 2005. As of 2016, Fopp has nine shops across England and Scotland. London Covent Garden, Oxford, Cambridge, Bristol, Nottingham Broadmarsh Centre, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow Union Street, and Glasgow Byres Road. It was announced that the shops in Oxford, Bristol, Manchester and Byres Road will close. However on 8 February 2019 it was revealed that the Byres Road shop is to reopen after local pressure. The store in Manchester reopened in May 2019.\n\n"}

Adult worms are 7.5 mm to 12 mm long and 4 mm to 6 mm wide. The thickness ranges from 3.5 mm to 5 mm. The skin of the worm (tegument) is thickly covered with scalelike spines. The oral and ventral suckers are similar in size, with the latter placed slightly pre-equatorially. The excretory bladder extends from the posterior end to the pharynx. The lobed testes are adjacent from each other located at the posterior end, and the lobed ovaries are off-centered near the center of the worm (slightly postacetabular). The uterus is located in a tight coil to the right of the acetabulum, which is connected to the vas deferens. The vitelline glands, which produce the yolk for the eggs, are widespread in the lateral field from the pharynx to the posterior end. Inspection of the tegumental spines and shape of the metacercariae may distinguish between the 30-odd species of \"Paragonimus spp.\" but the distinction is sufficiently difficult to justify suspicion that many of the described species are synonyms.\n\n\n\"P. westermani\" was discovered in the lungs of a human by Ringer in 1879 and eggs in the sputum were recognized independently by Manson and Erwin von Baelz in 1880. Manson proposed the snail as an intermediate host and various Japanese workers detailed the whole life cycle in the snail between 1916 and 1922. The species name \"P. westermani\" was named after Pieter Westerman (1859–1925) a zookeeper who noted the trematode in a Bengal tiger in an Amsterdam Zoo[Artis].\n\nUnembryonated eggs are passed in the sputum of a human or feline. Two weeks later, miracidia develop in the egg and hatches. The miracidia penetrate its first intermediate host (snail). Within the snail mother sporocyst form and produce many mother rediae, which subsequently produce many daughter rediae which shed crawling cercariae into fresh water. The crawling cercariae penetrate fresh water crabs and encyst in its muscles becoming metacercaria. Humans or felines then eat the infected crabs raw. Once eaten, the metacercaria excysts and penetrates the gut, diaphragm and lung where it becomes an adult worm in pairs.\n\nThe first intermediate hosts of the \"Paragonimus westermani\" are freshwater snails:\n\nFor many years \"Tarebia granifera\" was believed to be an intermediate host for the \"Paragonimus westermani\", but Michelson showed in 1992 that this was erroneous.\n\n\"Paragonimus\" has a quite complex life-cycle that involves two intermediate hosts as well as humans. Eggs first develop in water after being expelled by coughing (unembryonated) or being passed in human feces. In the external environment, the eggs become embryonated. In the next stage, the parasite miracidia hatch and invades the first intermediate host such as a species of freshwater snail. Miracidia penetrate its soft tissues and go through several developmental stages inside the snail but mature into cercariae in 3 to 5 months. Cercariae next invade the second intermediate host such as crabs or crayfish and encyst to develop into metacercariae within 2 months. Infection of humans or other mammals (definitive hosts) occurs via consumption of raw or undercooked crustaceans. Human infection with \"P. westermani\" occurs by eating inadequately cooked or pickled crab or crayfish that harbor metacercariae of the parasite. The metacercariae excyst in the duodenum, penetrate through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, then through the abdominal wall and diaphragm into the lungs, where they become encapsulated and develop into adults. The worms can also reach other organs and tissues, such as the brain and striated muscles, respectively. However, when this takes place completion of the life cycles is not achieved, because the eggs laid cannot exit these sites.\n\nReservoir hosts of \"Paragonimus\" spp. include numerous species of carnivores including felids, canids, viverrids, mustelids, some rodents and pigs. Humans become infected after eating raw freshwater crabs or crayfish that have been encysted with the metacerciaria. Southeast Asia is more predominately more infected because of lifestyles. Raw seafood is popular in these countries. Crab collectors string raw crabs together and bring them miles inland to sell in Taiwan markets. These raw crabs are then marinated or pickled in vinegar or wine to coagulate the crustacean muscle. This method of preparation does not kill the metacercariae, consequently infecting the host. Smashing rice-eating crabs in rice paddies, splashing juices containing metacercariae, can also transmit the parasite, or using juices strained from fresh crabs for medicinal uses. This parasite is easily spread because it is able to infect other animals (zoonosis). An assortment of mammals and birds can be infected and act as paratenic hosts. Ingestion of the paratenic host can lead to infection of this parasite.\n\n\"Paragonimus westermani\" is distributed in southeast Asia and Japan. Other species of \"Paragonimus\" are common in parts of Asia, Africa and South and Central America. \"P. westermani\" has been increasingly recognized in the United States during the past 15 years because of the increase of immigrants from endemic areas such as Southeast Asia and is estimated to infect 22 million people worldwide.\n\nTransmission of the parasite \"P. westermani\" to humans and mammals primarily occurs through the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood. In Asia, an estimated 80% of freshwater crabs carry \"P. westermani\". In preparation, live crabs are crushed and metacercariae may contaminate the fingers/utensils of the person preparing the meal. Accidental transfer of infective cysts can occur via food preparers who handle raw seafood and subsequently contaminate cooking utensils and other foods. Consumption of animals which feed on crustaceans can also transmit the parasite, for cases have been cited in Japan where raw boar meat was the source of human infection.\nFood preparation techniques such as pickling and salting do not exterminate the causative agent. For example, in a Chinese study eating \"drunken crabs\" was shown to be particularly risky because the infection rate was 100% when crabs are immersed in wine for 3–5 minutes and fed to cats/dog.\n\nAnimals such as pigs, dogs, and a variety of feline species can also harbor \"P. westermani\".\n\nThere is no vector, but various snail and crab species serve as intermediate hosts. In Japan and Korea, the crab species \"Eriocheir\" is an important item of food as well as a notable second intermediate host of the parasite.\n\nTime from infection to oviposition (laying eggs) is 65 to 90 days. \nInfections may persist for 20 years in humans.\n\nOnce in the lung or ectopic site, the worm stimulates an inflammatory response that allows it to cover itself in granulation tissue forming a capsule. These capsules can ulcerate and heal over time. The eggs in the surrounding tissue become pseudotubercles. If the worm becomes disseminated and gets into the spinal cord, it can cause paralysis; capsules in the heart can cause death. The symptoms are localized in the pulmonary system, which include a bad cough, bronchitis, and blood in sputum (hemoptysis).\n\nDiagnosis is based on microscopic demonstration of eggs in stool or sputum, but these are not present until 2 to 3 months after infection. However, eggs are also occasionally encountered in effusion fluid or biopsy material. Furthermore, you can use morphologic comparisons with other intestinal parasites to diagnose potential causative agents. Finally, antibody detection is useful in light infections and in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary paragonimiasis. In the United States, detection of antibodies to \"Paragonimus westermani\" has helped physicians differentiate paragonimiasis from tuberculosis in Indochinese immigrants.\n\nAdditionally, radiological methods can be used to X-ray the chest cavity and look for worms. This method is easily misdiagnosed, because pulmonary infections look like tuberculosis, pneumonia, or spirochaetosis. A lung biopsy can also be used to diagnose this parasite.\n\nAccording to the CDC, praziquantel is the drug of choice to treat paragonimiasis. The recommended dosage of 75 mg/kg per day, divided into 3 doses over 3 days has proven to eliminate \"P. westermani\". Bithionol is an alternative drug for treatment of this disease but is associated with skin rashes and urticaria. For additional information, see the recommendations in \"The Medical Letter\" (Drugs for Parasitic Infections).\n\nCase study: \nAn 11½-year-old Hmong Laotian boy was brought into the emergency room by his parents with a 2- to 3-month history of decreasing stamina and increasing dyspnea [shortness of breath] on exertion. He described an intermittent nonproductive cough and decreased appetite and was thought to have lost weight. He denied fever, chills, night sweats, headache, palpitations, hemoptysis [coughing up blood], chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea or urticaria [skin rash notable for dark red, raised, itchy bumps]. There were no pets at home. At the time of immigration to the United States 16 months earlier, all family members had negative purified protein derivative intradermal tests except one brother, who was positive but had a normal chest radiograph and subsequently received isoniazid for 12 months... a left lateral thoracotomy was performed during which 1800 ml of an odorless, cloudy, pea soup-like fluid containing a pale yellow, cottage cheese-like, proteinaceous material was removed, along with a solitary, 6-mm-long, reddish brown fluke subsequently identified as \"Paragonimus westermani\"\nHuman infection with \"Paragonimus\" may cause acute or chronic symptoms, and manifestations may be either pulmonary or extrapulmonary.\n\nAcute symptoms: \nThe acute phase (invasion and migration) may be marked by diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, cough, urticaria, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary abnormalities, and eosinophilia. The acute stage corresponds to the period of invasion and migration of flukes and consists of abdominal pain, diarrhea and urticaria, followed roughly 1 to 2 weeks later by fever, pleuritic chest pain, cough and/or dyspnea.\nChronic Symptoms: \nDuring the chronic phase, pulmonary manifestations include cough, expectoration of discolored sputum, hemoptysis, and chest radiographic abnormalities. Chronic pulmonary paragonimiasis, the most common clinical pattern, is frequently mild, with chronic cough, brown-tinged sputum (the color being caused by expectorated clusters of reddish brown eggs rather than by blood) and true hemoptysis.\n\nPractitioners should always consider the possibility of tuberculosis in patients with fevers, cough, and weight loss. However, in endemic areas it is prudent to consider paragonimiasis as well. Flukes occasionally cause confusion when they invade the pleural space without entering the lung parenchyma.\n\n\"In contrast to tuberculosis, pulmonary paragonimiasis is only rarely accompanied by rales or other adventitious breath sounds. Many patients are asymptomatic, and symptomatic patients frequently look well despite a prolonged course.\"\nIn pleural paragonimiasis, symptoms may be minimal and diagnosis complicated, since ova are not coughed or spit out or swallowed and there is frequently no cough. Such patients may develop pleural effusions and, because of the coendemicity with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (and co-infection in some patients), such effusions are often misdiagnosed as isolated tuberculosis.\n\nExtra-pulmonary locations of the adult worms result in more severe manifestations, especially when the brain is involved. Extra-pulmonary paragonimiasis is rarely seen in humans, as the worms nearly exclusively migrate to the lungs. Despite this, cysts can develop in the brain and abdominal adhesions resulting from infection have been reported. Cysts may contain living or dead worms; a yellow-brownish thick fluid (occasionally hemorrhagic). When the worm dies or escapes, the cysts gradually shrink, leaving nodules of fibrous tissues and eggs which can calcify.\n\nWorldwide the most common cause of hemoptysis is paragonimiasis.\n\nOther case studies:\n\nPrevention programs should promote more hygienic food preparation by encouraging safer cooking techniques and more sanitary handling of potentially contaminated seafood. The elimination of the first intermediate host, the snail, is not tenable due to the nature of the organisms habits. A key component to prevention is research, more specifically the research of everyday behaviors. This recent study was conducted as a part of a broader effort to determine the status of \"Paragonimus\" species infection in Laos. An epidemiological survey was conducted on villagers and schoolchildren in Namback District between 2003 and 2005. Among 308 villagers and 633 primary and secondary schoolchildren, 156 villagers and 92 children had a positive reaction on a \"Paragonimus\" skin test. Consequently, several types of crabs were collected from markets and streams in a paragonimiasis endemic area for the inspection of metacercariae and were identified as the second intermediate host of the \"Paragonimus\" species. In this case study, we see how high prevalence of paragonimiasis is explained by dietary habits of the population. Amongst schoolchildren, many students reported numerous experiences of eating roast crabs in the field. Adult villagers reported frequent consumption of seasoned crabs (Tan Cheoy Koung) and papaya salad (Tammack Koung) with crushed raw crab. In addition to this characteristic feature of the villagers' food culture, the denizens of this area drink fresh crab juice as a traditional cure for measles, and this was also thought to constitute a route for infection.\n\n\nThis article incorporates CC-BY-3.0 text from the reference.\n\n"}

He first came to the territory in 1935, when he traveled to Unalakleet to visit his uncle, Charles Traeger, who ran a trading post there and spent 2 years developing a portfolio of Alaskan scenes. After leaving Alaska, he spent some time as an illustrator in New York, but longed to return to Alaska. He returned in 1942 after volunteering with the U.S. Navy and requesting a posting to the Aleutian Islands during World War II. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was responsible for intelligence for the North Pacific Command. After the war, he trained for a short time at the Art Students League in New York, studying lithography under Will Barnet, and then returned to Unalakleet in 1946.\n\nMachetanz married Sara Dunn, a writer, in 1947, and the two settled near Palmer, Alaska in 1951. They published several books together and collaborated on films for Walt Disney, the Territory of Alaska, and Encyclopædia Britannica. They also made many promotional and lecture tours through the lower 48 states from 1948 through 1960. The turning point in Fred's painting career came on April 21, 1962, when Bob Atwood, editor and publisher of the Anchorage Times, arranged for a one-man show of his paintings. The works at the show sold quickly, and the success allowed Fred to pursue painting full-time.\n\nMachetanz was a strong colorist. He most often painted on hardboard, which was prepared with layers of an ultramarine blue base using a large brush. He then applied a transparent oil glazing technique to build up layers from there, emphasizing areas of color and form. This gave his works a cool, luminous quality that he felt reflected the environment of the Arctic.\n\nDuring his career, he produced fifty stone lithographs of scenes of Alaska.\n\nHe was named Alaskan of the Year in 1977, and American Artist of the Year in 1981 by \"American Artist\" magazine. Machetanz was also awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Alaska and The Ohio State University. As a result of their philanthropic activities, several facilities are named for the Machetanz's including: the football field at Palmer High School, a building at Mat-Su College, a theatre in Wasilla, and Fred & Sara Machetanz Elementary School in Wasilla.\n\nFred and Sara had a son, Traeger, in 1959 who practices law in Washington and Alaska.

It is centred on Wollaton Hall, a classic Elizabethan prodigy house which contains the Nottingham Natural History Museum, with the Nottingham Industrial Museum in the stable block. \n\nVarious events including concerts are held in the park.\n\nThe enclosure of Wollaton Park required the destruction of the village of Sutton Passeys. It was enclosed by Henry Willoughby, 6th Baron Middleton with a red brick wall at the start of the nineteenth century. Originally , land sales have reduced the park to .\n\nIn this park during World War II, American troops of the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the US 82nd Airborne Division, were billeted, waiting to be parachuted into Europe, which they did in June 1944. A small plaque commemorates this event. Subsequently German prisoners of war were billeted here for employment in the locality between 1945 and 1947.\n\nIn addition to Wollaton Hall the park hosts the following historic buildings:\n\nLenton Lodge is one of the Gatehouses built around the boundary of Wollaton Park. It was commissioned by Henry Willoughby, 6th Baron Middleton. It was designed by the architect Jeffry Wyatville and completed in 1825. It is built in the Elizabethan Revival style.\n\nWith the sale of part of the park for residential building, Lenton Lodge is now separated from the rest of the park, and stands isolated but prominent on Derby Road in Lenton. It was sold by Nottingham City Council in the early 1980s .\n\nA 99-year revolving lease was acquired by Moiz Saigara in 1996. Planning permission to convert Lenton Lodge to a single dwelling was obtained and major restoration work was undertaken by Moiz Saigara, using Julian Owen Associates as the architect. The main part of this work -apart from restoration and installation of services – was filling in the middle archway in such a way as to be able to connect the two wings without detracting from the appearance which identifies the building as a gatehouse. The Lodge was used by Moiz Saigara as his residence from 1996 to 2006, when the lease was sold to Chek Whyte.\n\nIn 2006-8 Lenton Lodge was restored by Chek Whyte Industries and sold as a office in 2009. It was occupied by Global Fire and Security for six years, and sold to the University of Nottingham in 2016.\n\nIt was designed by the architect Jeffry Wyatville around 1832. It is built of coursed Gritstone ashlar in a heavy Gothic style with \"martello-type\" round outer towers with battlements. The square central gatehouse is connected to the towers at the second floor level. It has an arched carriage entrance with an oriel window above. It was built following the Nottingham Reform riots in October 1831, and is now a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Each night there is a large corvid roost at the park, made up of rook, jackdaw, and carrion crow. Other bird species present at the site include jay, nuthatch and sparrowhawk. Migrating wildfowl grace the lake in the winter and species of note include gadwall, shoveler, wigeon and tufted duck. There is a good diversity of fungi present, especially in the winter months, mainly found near the wooded areas and the lake. Northern pike have been spotted swimming in the lake.\n\nIn 2017 local news reported that a pair of ring-necked parakeets had been seen in the park. These exotic birds have been breeding in London for several decades and spreading across the country, with sightings in Peterborough, Manchester, Liverpool, and even as far north as Edinburgh. In 2018 there are at least four parakeets living wild in Wollaton Park.\n\nWollaton Park is often used for major events, including:\n\n"}

It was intended as a communist-controlled center of authority, challenging organs of the legitimate and mainstream Polish Underground State. The existence of the KRN was later accepted by the Soviet Union and the council became to a large extent subjugated and controlled by the Soviets.\n\nThe KRN was established on the night of 31 December 1943 on the initiative of the Polish communist party, the Polish Workers' Party (PPR), then led by Władysław Gomułka. It was the implementation of the party's Central Committee decision of 7 November 1943. The council was declared to be the \"actual political representation of the Polish nation, empowered to act on behalf of the nation and manage its affairs until the time of Poland's liberation from the occupation\". From the beginning, the KRN viewed the prewar Sanation government and the contemporary Polish government in exile as illegitimate, based on the \"elitist-totalitarian\" April Constitution, \"whose legality had never been recognized by the nation\", and as representative of narrow reactionary interests. The new government formation would be based on the \"worker-peasant alliance\" and on the alliance with the Soviet Union. The Armia Ludowa was established as the KRN's armed force. The exile government and the Polish Underground State, especially the Armia Krajowa command, were worried by this development and by the progressing social radicalization in Poland by Soviet strings. They accelerated the formation of the already planned Council of National Unity (\"Rada Jedności Narodowej\", RJN), their own parliament, created on 9 January 1944.\n\nThe Soviet regime under Stalin, initially unaware of the establishment of the KRN because of the non-existent at that time communications, became critical of it until, according to the evolving international situation, the Soviets developed new ideas in respect to Poland and found the KRN to be a potentially convenient entity. A KRN delegation went to Moscow for talks with Stalin on 22 May 1944 and the body's existence was upheld.\n\nThe KRN was installed and dominated by pro-Soviet and pro-communist activists from various Polish far-left prewar parties. Attempts to broaden the KRN's base by absorbing other leftist and popular groups were unsuccessful. The left-wing of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) had also in mind a future People's Republic of Poland, but of a different variety than the communists and Soviets. The KRN included some members of the PPS, the Polish People's Party (PSL), the People's Party (SL), the Democratic Party (SD), the Labour Party (SP), non-aligned and politicians. Bolesław Bierut of the PPR became the KRN's chairman. Bierut was opposed to Gomułka's efforts to broaden the KRN's participation and a sharp conflict between the two ensued. Bierut believed in future communist rule based on the presence of the Soviet Red Army in Poland and did not want to dilute the PPR's identity and influence by the inclusion of too many other forces. The KRN's vice-chairmen were Wincenty Witos (PSL), Stanisław Grabski (nonaligned) and Stanisław Szwalbe (PPS).\n\nOn 22 July 1944, the KRN delegation and the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP), having deliberated in Moscow, took it upon themselves to form a new governmental structure, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (\"Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego\", PKWN), which was officially established in the Lublin province. PKWN gave rise to communist-dominated governments, which later included some former members of the Polish-government-in-exile, led by Stanisław Mikołajczyk, and represented a half-hearted attempt by the communists to meet the Yalta Conference requirements of forming a coalition government and carrying out free elections. On 31 December of that year, the KRN transformed the PKWN into the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (\"Rząd Tymczasowy Republiki Polskiej\", RTRP). Both early governments were headed by the socialist Edward Osóbka-Morawski.\n\nUntil the elections to parliament (Sejm), the KRN held both legislative and executive powers, and Bolesław Bierut was the head of state. In July 1945, the KRN had 273 members (97 from PPR, 77 from PPS, 56 from SL, 17 from SD, 26 non-aligned). In October 1946 it was expanded to 444 members (135 from PPR, 111 from PPS, 62 from SL, 57 from PSL, 37 from SD, 4 from SP, 3 Jewish representatives (1 each from the Bund, Communists and Zionists), 26 non-aligned).\n\nThe 1947 Polish legislative elections were rigged by the communists, who previously conducted the illegitimate Polish people's referendum of 1946. The unchallenged rule of the communists that followed, combined with extensive repressions and persecution, forced many opposition leaders to leave the country. The new Sejm, which replaced the KRN, was totally dominated by the communists and their allies until the collapse of communism in Poland in 1989.\n\n"}

Justin considers it an advantage going up against younger kids but is quickly defeated in his first match.\n\nAfter leaving the tournament in disappointment, he finds himself at a car show where he spots his neighbor, Vic (Roger Aaron Brown), and his vintage red Corvette. Justin notices a trophy to be awarded for best car and asks if Vic has a chance of winning it. He is told that it is unlikely, not because of the car as the contest holders consider it probably the best car there, but because the winner will be the one who collects the most money, something that will be hard for Vic due to his off-putting demeanor and personality. Justin gets an idea and offers to help Vic collect in exchange for the trophy if he wins. Vic initially refuses but realizes it's his best chance at winning and agrees to do it. Vic wins the contest and after gives Justin a ride home.\n\nA couple of days later, Vic drives by and asks Seth if Justin is home to which he's told no. He considers giving a box to Seth but ultimately decides against it and drives off. Seconds after Vic leaves, Justin and his mom pull up and Justin recognizing Vic's truck, asks Seth if he had a box with him. Seth says yes and Justin immediately takes off for Vic's house, ignoring his brother's pleas to help him with the groceries.\n\nJustin pulls up outside the house and calls out Vic's name, but gets no response. Determined to get his trophy, he wheels into the back of the house looking for Vic where he finds the Corvette stored in a garage. Inside the garage he spots a box high up on a shelf and assumes that it's his trophy. Unwilling to wait any longer to get it, he attempts to knock the box down, but instead inadvertently knocks down the shelf which lands on the car, damaging it, and causing it to roll down the driveway into some trash cans, damaging it further.\n\nForced to make up for what he did, Justin is sent to help Vic clean up the mess he made. As Vic gets to know Justin, he starts taking a liking to him and starts being friendlier, even offering Justin some milk and cookies. After finishing up the garage, Justin asks Vic if he wants him to help him with the shed too, an offer he quickly turns down, telling Justin to stay away from the shed.\n\nOne day, while helping Vic around the yard, Vic leaves Justin while he runs some errands. With him gone, Justin peeks into the shed through a window and notices multiple trophies inside. He goes inside and discovers even more awards along with a soapbox racer. He starts up an old film and sees on the screen a young girl racing soapbox racers. As he watches on with interest, the door behind him opens and Vic storms in, demanding that Justin leave.\n\nJustin hopes to participate in that sport and eventually finds a love and talent for it. To accommodate his disability, his father and their neighbor, Vic, build a customized racer with a hand brake (which they call the \"Justin Brake\"). Meanwhile, Seth feels that his parents focus too much on Justin rather than giving both equal treatment. However, he has a change of heart when Justin crashes during a race.\n\nThe Yoders are confronted with the idea that Justin's involvement with the sport may be hazardous to his health. At the end of the film, he asks God if people are perfect when they go to Heaven. In response, he shows him a vision of it where there are people with and without wheelchairs, all together, to which he happily replies \"perfect\".\n\nAs a tribute to Justin, live footage of him is shown before the closing credits.\n\n\nOriginally known as Wheelies, the telefilm was in production in March 2000 for a May 2000 Disney Channel premiere.\n\nGreg Beeman (director), Christopher Morgan (unit production manager) (plaque), Lisa C.

Symptoms, which include itchy, raised papules, commonly occur within 1–2 days of infection and do not generally last more than 2–3 weeks. However, people repeatedly exposed to cercariae develop heavier symptoms with faster onset. Cercarial dermatitis is common in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats worldwide. Incidence may be on the rise, although this may also be attributed to better monitoring. Nevertheless, the condition has been regarded as emerging infectious disease.\n\nThere are no permanent effects to people from this condition. Orally administered hydroxyzine, an antihistamine, is sometimes prescribed to treat swimmer's itch and similar dermal allergic reactions. In addition, bathing in oatmeal, baking soda, or Epsom salts can also provide relief of symptoms.\n\nSwimmer's itch probably has been around as long as humans. The condition was known to exist as early as the 1800s, but it was not until 1928 that a biologist found that the dermatitis was caused by the larval stage of a group of flatworm parasites in the family Schistosomatidae. The genera most commonly associated with swimmer's itch in humans are \"Trichobilharzia\" and \"Gigantobilharzia\". It can also be caused by schistosome parasites of non-avian vertebrates, such as \"Schistosomatium douthitti\", which infects snails and rodents. Other taxa reported to cause the reaction include \"Bilharziella polonica\" and \"Schistosoma bovis\". In marine habitats, especially along the coasts, swimmer's itch can occur as well.\n\nThese parasites use both freshwater snails and vertebrates as hosts in their parasitic life cycles as follows:\n\nHumans usually become infected after swimming in lakes or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely in the morning and on sunny days, and exposure to water in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe and North America, and shallow inshore waters may harbour higher densities of cercariae than open waters offshore. Onshore winds are thought to cause cercariae to accumulate along shorelines. Studies of infested lakes and outbreaks in Europe and North America have found cases where infection risk appears to be evenly distributed around the margins of water bodies as well as instances where risk increases in endemic swimmer's itch \"hotspots\". Children may become infected more frequently and more intensely than adults but this probably reflects their tendency to swim for longer periods inshore, where cercariae also concentrate. Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host skin include unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in sun lotions and creams based on plant oils.\n\nVarious strategies targeting the mollusc and avian hosts of schistosomes, have been used by lakeside residents in recreational areas of North America to deal with outbreaks of swimmer's itch. In Michigan, for decades, authorities used copper sulfate as a molluscicide to reduce snail host populations and thereby the incidence of swimmer's itch. The results with this agent have been inconclusive, possibly because:\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, copper sulfate is toxic to more than just molluscs, and the effects of its use on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood.\n\nAnother method targeting the snail host, mechanical disturbance of snail habitat, has been also tried in some areas of North America and Lake Annecy in France, with promising results. Some work in Michigan suggests that administering praziquantel to hatchling waterfowl can reduce local swimmer's itch rates in humans. Work on schistosomiasis showed that water-resistant topical applications of the common insect repellent DEET prevented schistosomes from penetrating the skin of mice. Public education of risk factors, a good alternative to the aforementioned interventionist strategies, can also reduce human exposure to cercariae.\n\n"}

He served as a head coach for the NBA's Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks, and Los Angeles Lakers, as well as the Legends. He was also an assistant coach for the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets, Chicago Bulls, Dallas Mavericks, Milwaukee Bucks, and the Houston Rockets.\n\nHarris is a 1955 graduate of Plainfield High School (Indiana) in Plainfield, Indiana. He was inducted into the first class of Plainfield High School's Hall of Fame.\n\nHarris graduated from Milligan College in 1959 \"cum laude\" with a bachelor's degree in religious studies. In 1965, Harris earned a master's degree in history from Indiana University.\n\nHe began his coaching career at the Junior High School level in Johnson City, Tennessee but is best known for his tenure in his native Indiana; in four years in the Indiana ranks he built a record of 54-15 over his last three seasons, winning two Conference titles and a Sectional title.\n\nHe coached at three different high schools in Indiana; the Roachdale Hawks, the Dale Golden Aces and the Spencer Cops; his greatest success came at Dale, as he led the Golden Aces to a 2-year record of 35-9 and a Pocket Athletic Conference title. He also coached the Dale baseball team to a PAC title and a record of 26-7; his success built using players such as Roger Kaiser and Bob Reinhart. He moved to Spencer for the 1964–65 season where they had a 19-6 record, winning another Conference title and an IHSAA Sectional title but lost in the Regional finals to Bloomington. The following year, he was hired by Earlham College.\n\nHarris was coach at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana for nine seasons, building a record of 175-70 (.714) as he led the Quakers to three Conference (2 Hoosier Collegiate Conf. & 1 Hoosier-Buckeye Collegiate Conf) titles and two Top-12 rankings. His best seasons were 1967–68 when they were ranked 6th in the NAIA final polls with a 25-3 record, making him a finalist for NAIA national coach of the year, and in 1970–71, when the Quakers achieved a record of 24-5. In that year they won the HBCC and reached the National Tournament, losing in the 2nd round. He remains, today, as the Earlham coaching leader in wins and winning percentage. He led the Quakers to 15 conference or tournament titles during his tenure.\n\nHarris coached seven summers in the Superior League of Puerto Rico while at Earlham, winning three national titles while coaching against various ABA, NBA and NCAA coaches. He coached the Iberia Superstars of the European Professional Basketball League in early 1975.\n\nAfter becoming acquainted with Utah Stars head coach Tom Nissalke, he was invited into the professional ranks in 1975 as an assistant coach for Nissalke at the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association (ABA). When that franchise folded, Nissalke and Harris were hired as head and assistant coach, respectively, for the NBA's Houston Rockets at the start of the 1976–77 season. They won the Central Division that year, Nissalke earning Coach of the Year honors.\n\nWhen Nissalke was let go by the club after the 1979 season, Harris was asked to take over head coaching duties for the 1979–80 season. Harris led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in the 1981 season, where they were defeated by the Boston Celtics four games to two in Larry Bird's first championship. Hall of Famer Moses Malone made Harris the Rockets' winningest coach in the first three years with 128 wins and three trips to the playoffs, but when Philadelphia acquired Malone in free agency, the Rockets sacrificed the season to get Ralph Sampson in the draft. Not signing any of their own free agents, the Rockets finished last and Harris was replaced with Bill Fitch.\n\nDon Nelson hired Harris for the Milwaukee Bucks team, where he became head coach four years later when Nelson left for Golden State after experiencing a rift with Bucks owner Herb Kohl. A year later Harris was also named Vice President of Basketball Operations.\n\nAfter his stint with the Bucks, Harris became head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, winning NBA Coach of the Year honors in 1994–95, winning 48 games a year removed from being in the NBA lottery. In his four full seasons the Lakers won more each successive season, following 48 wins with 53, 56 and 61. In his third season the Lakers acquired 18-year-old Kobe Bryant and 24-year-old Shaquille O'Neal. Despite being the youngest team in the league and O'Neal missing 53 games due to injuries those two seasons, the Lakers eliminated the 61-win Seattle SuperSonics in the playoffs before being eliminated by the Utah Jazz with Karl Malone and John Stockton in the 1997–98 season. The Lakers fired Harris after leading them to a 6–6 start at the beginning of the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season.\n\nHarris was an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks from 2000 to 2007.\n\nOn July 3, 2008, the \"Chicago Tribune\" reported that Harris agreed to become an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls along with former Charlotte Bobcats head coach Bernie Bickerstaff and longtime NBA assistant Bob Ociepka. Along with Bickerstaff and Ociepka, Harris was expected to help establish a veteran presence on the coaching staff and help rookie head coach Vinny Del Negro. In June 2009, it was reported that Harris would step down as assistant coach to the Bulls, and retire after a career spanning 50 years.\n\nOn November 30, 2009, after the New Jersey Nets had lost their first 18 games and removed coach Lawrence Frank, GM Kiki VanDeWeghe asked Harris to come help him as he took over the coaching reins. Harris stayed until the week before the All-Star game and announced he would not continue on the rest of the season. He returned to his home in the Dallas area to be the General Manager of the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League, the Mavericks minor league affiliate.\n\nOn October 3, 2011, it was announced that Harris would take over as the head coach for the Dallas Mavericks' NBA Development League affiliate the Texas Legends. At age 74 he was the oldest head coach in the history of the NBA system. The following year, he returned to being GM and Eduardo Najera was named head coach. Currently Harris is the Vice President of the Legends.\n\nStarting with the 2017-2018 season, he is serving as a pregame and postgame analyst on Mavs Live on Fox Sports Southwest.\n\nHarris coached seven seasons in Puerto Rico's National Superior League (1969–75), posting a 176-61 record and winning three national championships (1973–75). His club team, the Bayamón Vaqueros, won bronze in the FIBA Will Jones Cup in 1972 in São Paulo Brazil, the championships for World Club team. He also served as head coach of the National Team for the CentroBasket games in El Salvador in 1974, winning the first international gold in Puerto Rico's history. He also coached the team to a silver in the FIBA Copa do America X Europa in São Paulo, Brazil in 1974.\n\nIn 1994, he served as consultant for Canada and assisted head coach, Ken Shields, in the World Games in Toronto.\n\nHe was an assistant coach under Rudy Tomjanovich with the US national team in the 1998 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal. The team was handicapped by only using college players as there was a lockout in the NBA.\n\nHarris also served as the first foreigner to become coach of the Chinese national men's team, where he coached NBA All-Star center Yao Ming and led China to a surprising upset victory over Serbia and Montenegro in the 2004 Athens Olympic basketball tournament.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, Harris assisted coach John Calipari with the Dominican Republic national team. They won bronze in 2011 FIBA Americas Championship in Mar del Plata, Argentina (the first major basketball medal in the Dominic Republic's history). In winning the bronze medal they qualified for the 2012 World Olympic qualifier in Caracas, Venezuela. They finished fourth, thus missing to qualify for the Olympics by one game in both years. They did win the gold medal at the CentroBasket Games held in Puerto Rico prior to the World Qualifier, beating the host time for the first time ever on their home court.\n\nIn 2010, he was awarded the Jerry Colangelo Award for Leadership and character on and off the court at the NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles. In 2014, he received the Coach John Wooden \"Keys to Excellence\" Award the NCAA Final Four in Dallas.\n\nHe is a member of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, the NAIA Basketball Hall of Fame as well as those of Milligan College and Earlham College.\n\nHe has four sons (Alex, Larry, Stan, and Dominic) and one daughter (Carey). All of his children played basketball at the collegiate level (Eastern New Mexico, Eastern New Mexico, University of North Texas, Dallas Baptist University, and Marquette University respectively). He is the father of former Bucks general manager Larry Harris.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, Harris was named as one of two 2019 recipients of the John Bunn Award (with Harry Glickman), awarded by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a lifetime achievement honor for those \"whose outstanding accomplishments have impacted the high school, college, professional and/or the international game.\"\n\nHarris appeared in some minor roles in Space Jam, Over the Top, In the House, and Diagnosis Murder\n\n! align=\"left\" colspan=\"2\"|Career ||1,013||556||457||.549|| ||88||38||50||.432|| |\nHarris has been inducted into the Plainfield High School (Indiana) Hall of Fame, the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

He served in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the campaign against the Kohat Pass Afridis, the suppression of the Santhal rebellion, and the suppression of the Indian Mutiny. He became military member of the Viceroy's Council (in effect Minister for War in India) in 1870, in which role he maintained the policy of ensuring that the Indian Army were less well armed than British troops there to deter another mutiny. As a result, he became a member of the Council of India; and in his later years he became Governor of Jamaica and then Governor of Queensland.\nBorn one of two sons (his brother was Francis Booth Norman) of James Norman, a merchant who had conducted most of his business in Cuba before moving to Calcutta, and his wife Charlotte Norman (née Wylie), Norman joined the family firm in Calcutta in 1842 and then set about persuading his father to let him join the Bengal Army.\n\nHaving obtained a cadetship in the Bengal Native Infantry, Norman was then commissioned as an ensign in the 1st Bengal Native Infantry on 1 March 1844 and then transferred to the 31st Bengal Native Infantry in March 1845. He was posted to Lahore in 1846 and, having been promoted to lieutenant on 25 December 1847, took part in the Battle of Ramnagar in November 1848, the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Having attracted the favourable notice of Sir Colin Campbell, Norman was selected by Campbell to accompany an expedition against the Kohat Pass Afridis in 1850 as officiating brigade-major.\nThe subaltern of twenty-four was given a substantive appointment in this capacity for a splendid deed of gallantry, which is recorded by Sir Charles Napier in the following terms:\n\n\"In the pass of Kohat a sepoy picket, descending a precipitous mountain under fire and the rolling of large stones, had some men killed and wounded. Four of the latter, dreadfully hurt, crept under some rocks for shelter. They were not missed until the picket reached the bottom, but were then discovered by our glasses, high up and helpless. Fortunately the enemy did not see them, and some sepoys volunteered a rescue, headed by Norman of the 31st Native Infantry and Ensign Murray of the 70th Native Infantry. These brave men would that the names of all were known to me for record ascended the rocks in defiance of the enemy, and brought the wounded men down.\"\n\nNorman served in numerous frontier expeditions between 1850 and 1854 and in the suppression of the Santhal rebellion of 1855 to 1856 before becoming assistant adjutant general in India in May 1856. During the Indian Mutiny he was constantly engaged, being present at the Siege of Delhi in Summer 1857, the Siege of Lucknow in November 1857, the Second Battle of Cawnpore in December 1857 and the Capture of Lucknow in March 1858. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 17 August 1859.\nPromoted to captain on 1 March 1859, Norman became assistant military secretary for Indian affairs at the Horse Guards in October 1860. He was further promoted to brevet major on 3 December 1860 and to brevet lieutenant colonel on 4 December 1860. He went back to India in 1861 as deputy adjutant general of the Bengal Army and then became military secretary to the government of India in January 1862. He was appointed an aide-de-camp to the Queen in September 1863 and, having been promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 March 1864, to brevet colonel on 8 September 1868 and to brevet major-general on 23 March 1869, he was given the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 March 1870.\n\nNorman went on to become military member of the Governor-General's Council (in effect Minister for War in India) in May 1870, in which role he maintained the policy of ensuring that the Indian Army were less well armed than British troops there to deter another mutiny. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 24 May 1873, promoted to lieutenant general on 1 October 1877 and returned to London to become a member of the Council of India in February 1878. He was promoted to full general on 1 April 1882 and retired from active military service.\n\nIn October 1883 Norman became Governor of Jamaica and implemented the decision of the Colonial Office to introduce a new constitution intended to limit the ability of the local assembly, which was dominated by white plantation owners, to make all decisions. Appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 24 May 1887 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 21 June 1887, he was transferred to the post of Governor of Queensland in 1889: although his mandate was to cut public expenditure, he managed to get on well with both the local politicians and the local people who were impressed by his administrative skills. Declining the post of Viceroy of India in September 1893, Norman left Queensland in November 1895 and returned to London. He was appointed a Commissioner to enquire into the conditions and prospects of the West India Sugar-growing Colonies in December 1896.\n\nNorman became governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in April 1901, and, having been promoted to field marshal on 26 June 1902, became a Commissioner to inquire into the military preparations for the Second Boer War in September 1902. He died at the Royal Hospital Chelsea on 26 October 1904 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.\n\nOn 14 April 1853, at Peshawar in India, Norman married Selina Eliza Davidson (d.1862) by whom he had three daughters. He married a widow, Jemima Anne Temple (née Knowles), in September 1864 but she died the year after.

It was also the first in the world to feature twin-towers.\nThe tallest space shot in the world is the \"La Venganza del Enigma\" in Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid (115m)\n\n The mechanism consists of a central tower around which rows of seats are placed with the riders facing outward away from the tower. In the center of the tower is a large columnar pipe system. Threaded through the main pipe column is a cable that is attached to a piston on one end, looped over a pulley at the top of the tower and attached to the seat carriage on the other.\n\nIn the loading position, the seat carriage is at the base of the tower and the piston is at the top of the pipe column. Once the ride has been loaded, the seats are lifted slightly off the ground and loaded seats are weighed in order to calculate the amount of air pressure needed to safely propel the seats up the tower. Upon charging the air system to the correct pressure, compressed air is injected into the central column pushing the piston rapidly downward. As the piston moves down, it pulls the cable downward over the pulley at the top, propelling the seat carriage up the outside of the tower.\n\nUpon exhausting the air from the pressure system, the carriage descends, drawing the piston back up the pipe column. As the piston moves up, the air inside the pipe column alternately compresses and expands, causing the carriage to bounce several times. With each bounce, a pressure relief valve at the top of the pipe column releases some of the compressed air making each successive bounce smaller until the carriage reaches the loading platform.\n\n\"Below is a visual representation of the ride cycle:\"\n\n\n"}

He later got opportunities as a head coach for the Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks, before helping the Dallas Mavericks win the 2011 NBA Championship as an assistant coach.\n\nBorn in Cedar Falls, Iowa, Stotts grew up in Illinois, Wisconsin, Guam, and Indiana and graduated from Bloomington High School North in Bloomington, Indiana in 1976. Stotts was a member of the 1976 Indiana All-Star Team.\n\nStotts was a starter in all his four seasons with the University of Oklahoma Sooners basketball team and was an Academic All-American selection in his junior and senior seasons and an All-Big Eight Conference selection in his senior season. He graduated from Oklahoma in 1980 with a B.S. in zoology and a Master's in Business Administration from Oklahoma in 1988 on a postgraduate scholarship from the NCAA.\n\nStotts was a second round selection of the Houston Rockets in the 1980 NBA draft, but he could not find a place on the team. He began his professional playing career in Italy before joining George Karl's Continental Basketball Association (CBA) team, the Montana Golden Nuggets, in the early 1980s. He played for the team for three seasons. He then returned to Europe for several seasons, playing in Spain (CB Estudiantes) and France.\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Stotts joined Karl's coaching staff as an assistant with the CBA's Albany Patroons in 1990–91. During his first year, he helped lead the Patroons to an all-time CBA-best 50–6 record. Stotts then coached the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury for one season before rejoining Karl as part of his staff on the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA. He then moved with Karl to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1998.\n\nIn 2002, he decided to part ways with Karl and joined the Atlanta Hawks as an assistant coach. He was promoted to head coach 27 games into the season after Lon Kruger was fired. Stotts led the Hawks to a 52–85 record before he was let go and returned to the assistant coaching ranks with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nIn 2005, he became the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. He guided them to the playoffs in his first season, but was fired towards the end of his second season on March 14, 2007.\n\nHe was hired as an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks shortly after Rick Carlisle was hired as head coach in September 2008. He was credited for coordinating the Mavericks' offense that was one of the most efficient in the league in 2010–11, when they won the NBA title.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers hired Stotts as their head coach on August 7, 2012. At the time, his NBA coaching record was 115–168. The Blazers went 33–49 in Stotts's first year, losing their final 13 games to drop out of the playoff race.\n\nIn Stotts's second season with the Trail Blazers, he coached the team to an overall record of 54–28. They beat the Houston Rockets in the first round of the NBA Playoffs with a buzzer-beating three point shot by Damian Lillard to advance to the second round, but fell short to the eventual NBA champion San Antonio Spurs in the second round, ultimately losing in five games.\n\nIn Stotts's third season, he led the team to an overall record of 51–31. After sustaining some key injuries, they fell to the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the NBA Playoffs 4–1.\n\nDespite losing four of his starters, including star forward LaMarcus Aldridge, in the off-season, Stotts's fourth season saw him lead the Trail Blazers to the second round, after defeating the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. In the second round, Portland played the top-seeded Golden State Warriors to a very competitive five-game series, but eventually lost 4–1. On May 16, 2016, Stotts agreed on a contract extension with the Trail Blazers.\n\nIn the 2018–19 season, Stotts led the Trail Blazers to a 53–29 regular season record and their deepest playoff run in almost 20 years. Portland defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4–1 and Denver Nuggets 4–3 in the first two rounds but were swept by the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.\n\n"}

Eguchi created mostly electronic music in the early part of his career, but now almost exclusively focuses on orchestral composition and arrangement, along with performing keyboards for various other musicians.\n\nBorn in Nagasaki, Japan, Eguchi became interested in music at the age of six when he heard his neighbor playing the piano. While his father, a judo athlete, initially tried to push him into pursuing sports, he eventually agreed to let him take piano lessons, as long as he agreed to study with his sister. Eguchi enrolled at the Tokyo Conservatoire Shobi, where he met long-term composing partner Noriko Matsueda. After graduating from the conservatoire, he produced numerous compositions, joined a band as a keyboardist, and worked as a software designer. He also gave Matsueda advice on music manipulation during her first game project, \"Front Mission\", in 1995. At her request, he also arranged and orchestrated \"Theme of Bahamut Lagoon ~ Opening\" for the bonus disc of the original soundtrack to \"Bahamut Lagoon\" (1996).\n\nEguchi joined Square (now Square Enix) in 1998; his first job was composing the 1999 title \"Racing Lagoon\" alongside Matsueda. Although his role was minor compared to Matsueda's, he was responsible for the opening and ending themes, the majority of the battle themes, and the bonus track \"Taiman Battle Remix\". Eguchi and Matsueda collaborated once again in 2000 on the PlayStation 2 game \"The Bouncer\". He created a lot more music than on previous soundtracks; a large amount of the music produced was not used in the game and there were also many post-production demands. He composed the pop ballad \"Forevermore\", which was arranged and provided lyrics by Narada Michael Walden and Sunny Hilden and performed by Shanice in \"Love Is the Gift\", the ending theme to the English-language versions of the game. The song was also sold as a single and featured in a promotional album. In 2002, Eguchi arranged the track \"Hand in Hand -Reprise-\" for Yoko Shimomura's score to \"Kingdom Hearts\".\n\nEguchi reunited with Matsueda to compose \"Final Fantasy X-2\" (2003). Despite being panned by critics and fans alike and having a low budget, the soundtrack was commercially successful. He was also the game's orchestrator and the composer of the love ballad \"Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba\". In 2004, Eguchi and Matsueda composed \"Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission\" and arranged three pieces in the \"Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection\" album. The Piano Collections album was their final project at while at Square Enix, which they both left afterward. Since his departure, he has been involved in several anime projects; he was the co-composer of \"D.N.Angel\" (2003) and \"Rental Magica\" (2007) and the sole composer of \"Trinity Blood\" (2005). He has also mixed Shimomura's arrangements for the \"Dark Chronicle Premium Arrange\" album and performed piano on her vocal album \"Murmur\". In 2006, he contributed three compositions and two arrangements to the Xbox 360 game \"Sonic the Hedgehog\"; he also worked on the 2008 follow-up \"Sonic Unleashed\". He has since worked on a number of Sonic Team games, such as \"\", \"Sonic Colors\", \"Sonic Generations\", \"Rhythm Thief & the Emperor's Treasure\", \"Sonic Lost World\", and \"Sonic Runners\".\n\nEguchi and Matsueda are noted for creating mainly jazzy and electronic tracks for the scores they have collaborated on; Eguchi is credited for most of the electronic music. The soundtrack to \"The Bouncer\", of which Eguchi and Matsueda co-composed a lot of the pieces, featured among other genres rock, electronica, and jazz fusion. A professional pianist, Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions. He has stated that most of the time he composes and arranges music is at his home studio, where his friends help out by recording acoustic instruments; if the quality of these recordings are not adequate, however, Eguchi replaces them at the company's studio. He has said that by the time he is finished creating the music, he is only sleeping three to four hours a week.\n\nSince joining Sega Digital Studio in 2006, Eguchi has switched over to almost an exclusively orchestral style. On recent projects, he has assisted his fellow co-workers with string and keyboard arrangements, in addition to writing his own material.\n\nHe cites Igor Stravinsky, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Miles Davis as musical influences. When asked about which musicians he would like to collaborate with, he replied, \"A musician who has passed away, Miles Davis. There are too many living musicians to talk about. A few are Herbie Hancock, Aretha Franklin, and Ryuichi Sakamoto.\" His interest in composition came about after being inspired by a variety of jazz, electronic, modernist, and pop musicians.\n"}
{"id": "2196375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196375", "title": "Zomba Group of Companies", "text": "Zomba Group of Companies\n\nThe Zomba Group of Companies (sometimes referred to as Zomba Music Group or just Zomba Group) was a music group and division owned by and operated under Sony Music Entertainment. The division was renamed to Jive Label Group in 2009 and was placed under the RCA/Jive Label Group umbrella. In 2011, the RCA/Jive Label Group was split in half. Multiple Jive Label Group artists were moved to Epic Records while others stayed with Jive as it moved under the RCA Music Group. In October 2011 Jive Records was shut down and their artists were moved to RCA Records.\n\nFounded independently in the mid-seventies by Clive Calder and Ralph Simon, the group has had interests in music release, distribution, production, publishing, equipment rental, recording studios, and artist management. Though the financial structure and annual revenue of Zomba during the company's independent period was only known to CEO Clive Calder (the company was registered privately offshore in the Dutch Antilles), Zomba was widely regarded as the most successful of the independent music companies.\n\nThe group is perhaps best known for its role in developing some of the most popular forms of music, such as hip-hop in the 1980s, and the teen pop/boy band phenomenon in the late 1990s through their first record label Jive, though they have also had substantial activities in both the Christian and gospel music field. Calder and Simon both served as CEOs until 1990 when Calder bought out Simon's share and ran the company himself until 2002. In 2002, BMG purchased the company and subsequently restructured the labels under the umbrella company Zomba Label Group, which was the most public face of the company. The label group served as a parent for many different labels including Jive, Silvertone, Volcano and LaFace.\n\nToday, the only Zomba labels that still in operation are So So Def Recordings, Music for Nations, Silvertone and Christian focused music labels. Big part of the Zomba labels were absorbed into RCA Records and Epic Records, as well Legacy Recordings, Sony's division for catalogue reissues.\n\nThe company still own the \"Zomba\" and \"Jive\" trademarks as of 2018 through a Swiss company called Zomba Corporation.\n\nIn late 1971, Clive Calder and Ralph Simon began their two-decade partnership in forming businesses in record production and promotion, music publishing, artist management and concert promotion in South Africa. Because of the market in South Africa, there was a need to branch out into various aspects of the business, instead of just focusing on one aspect of the industry. \"You couldn't do just one thing. It was too small,\" explained David Gresham, CEO of David Gresham Record Company. \"This is not a country where you have a million-seller. A No. 1 record is a 10,000 unit seller. That only pays the rent for a month or two.\" While almost mandatory in South Africa, this early style of music company would be adapted to other markets throughout the companies history, and would become a staple of Calder's managing legacy.\n\nEarly companies formed by Calder and Simon were Sagittarius Management and Clive Calder Productions (CCP). CCP was distributed by EMI Records South Africa who purchased the company in 1972. Although Calder has no stake in it now, it still exists as a wholly owned subsidiary of EMI, specializing in the recording, development and marketing of domestic artists. Calder's relationship with EMI began when he had been an A&R Manager at EMI South Africa for eighteen months. There he had signed some big groups for the time such as Freedom's Children and the Otis Waygood Blues Band. During this time, Calder was also a bassist in a few bands. He formed the Four Dukes and the In Crowd with EMI artist Peter Vee, whom he also produced. Calder eventually paired Lee with a young producer named Mutt Lange,who at the time had produced for David Gresham and David Gresham Records local hit \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\" by Jessica Jones on Gresham's Nitty Gritty Records.\n\nThe trio of Calder, Simon and Lange decided in 1974 that they had to get out of South Africa. \"We were politically very much opposed to the old apartheid regime\" says Simon. They pooled together what little money they had and moved to London. Having landed right in the middle of the British punk rock movement, they felt their experience would not be best utilized in marketing and promotion in such a different context. Instead, they opted to create a publishing company and Zomba Corporation was officially registered in Switzerland in 1975, operating out of Calder's bedroom space in London.<ref name=\"woweu0506/3\"></ref> The name \"Zomba\" referred to the capital of African country Malawi (Lilongwe superseded Zomba as Malawi's capital in 1974).\n\nNext, Calder and Simon began looking for songwriters. The first was Henri Belolo, the French producer who helped create the Village People. Zomba became the disco group's British publisher. Though the band had been turned down by a few UK labels, Calder and Simon thought they could retain the most control of Zomba if they stayed in the publishing and management business, allowing other labels to release their artists' music. Meanwhile, Lange was building a name for himself as a producer, with albums by the Boomtown Rats, Graham Parker and eventually AC/DC's 1979 \"Highway to Hell\", his breakthrough album. This led to Lange becoming one of the world's leading hard-rock producers, later adding Def Leppard, Foreigner and Bryan Adams to his resume. For Zomba, this meant increased exposure and credibility leading to many new producer and songwriter management deals. Additionally, artists would sign publishing deals, giving their publishing company a constantly burgeoning collection.\n\nIn early 1978, Zomba opened offices in New York City and began looking for more artists and songwriters. Clive Davis was one of the first to contact the group, who used his recently formed Arista Records to distribute Zomba artists. The first major signing was Billy Ocean. Over the next few years, Zomba's songwriters hit it big and the publishing profits kicked in, marking the beginning of the company's first major expansion into record labels. Though Davis wanted Calder to head his West Coast A&R operations, Calder had different plans altogether, and instead presented Jive Records to Davis.\n\nArista had been having trouble pushing rock acts in the US, and Clive Davis had hoped that with Zomba's Mutt Lange connection, Jive would fill that role. However, Calder had other ideas. In 1981, Jive began operations by releasing British dance and pop music such as Q-Feel, A Flock of Seagulls and Tight Fit. By 1982, Calder was introduced to a young fresh college graduate named Barry Weiss who, for his job interview with Zomba, took Calder out to hip-hop and black clubs all over New York City. Calder was immediately impressed with the man and had him scanning sales data all over the country searching for unknown acts on small labels selling large numbers. Calder got one of his songwriters Thomas Dolby to create a catchy hook for a local DJ Mr. Magic to rap over. Mr. Magic had to cancel at the last minute, but fortunately he knew another rapper, Jalil Hutchins. Weiss's stress level shot up when Hutchins came to the session with another unknown rapper named Ecstasy and no rhymes. After two days, the group created and recorded \"Magic's Wand\" which turned into a hit single. Weiss named the group Houdini, but Calder changed it to Whodini. Calder flew the group to London to record an album, then to Germany to record with producer Konrad \"Conny\" Plank of Devo and Ultravox fame. While the group would eventually leave Jive after a few albums, the early success resulted in Jive becoming a label with a focus on hip-hop artists throughout the eighties. At a time when the record establishment wouldn't touch \"ghetto\" music like rap, a white South African successfully marketed some of the edgiest black music.\n\nAfter Whodini, Jive began signing other rap artists into the later half of the decade. Boogie Down Productions was signed on the strength of their first record \"Criminal Minded\", and their Jive debut \"By All Means Necessary\" was released in 1988. Young West Coast rapper Too Short was picked up by Jive after his independently released \"Born to Mack\" sold over 50,000 copies. Jive gave the album national distribution which led to gold status, and then quickly issued his follow up \"Life Is...Too Short\" which achieved platinum status. Meanwhile, Jive signed DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince in 1986 and released their debut \"Rock the House\". The duo was a great success for Jive, helping make rap more accessible.\n\nJive continued supporting rap artists into the nineties. Most of the aforementioned groups continued on Jive into the next decade. KRS-One, the primary force behind Boogie Down Productions, released a string of solo albums with Jive beginning with \"Return of the Boom Bap\" in 1993. In 1991, Jive signed R&B artist R. Kelly who, along with his backing band Public Announcement, released their debut \"Born into the 90's\" in early 1992. R. Kelly's began his solo career with \"12 Play\" in 1993 and continues to release with Jive today. A Tribe Called Quest was signed by Jive in 1989 following a successful independently released single \"Description of a Fool.\" Their debut album \"People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm\" was released by Jive in 1990 and framed the group as one of the most intelligent rap groups. Many other rap and R&B artists were signed throughout the eighties and nineties before the teen-pop explosion in the later half of the decade.\n\nBy 1990, Zomba was worth $225 million with over fifty companies. Contrary to most other record businesses at the time, Zomba spared no time with frills. \"The Jive offices were crummy, cardboard desks. They just really did everything on the cheap\", says attorney Gary Stiffelman. The company began to attract more major label attention when EMI attempted to buy the company, but was ultimately turned down. This period also saw Ralph Simon leaving Zomba at the start of the decade. Through an unspecified \"ethical disagreement\", Calder and Simon ended their relationship of over two decades. Calder bought out Simon's half of the company and subsequently gained full control of the company. In late 1991, BMG furthered its relationship with Zomba buy purchasing a 25% stake in their music publishing business, allowing them to sub-publish Zomba compositions in foreign markets. BMG continued with a 20% purchase of Zomba's records division in 1996.\n\nBuilding on the successes of the Jive label, Zomba began expanding its reach by purchasing and creating new labels, and by creating new divisions that helped expose more people to Zomba artists and services. In 1988, Andrew Lauder formed the UK-based Silvertone Records under the Zomba Group. While Jive focused on hip hop, Silvertone focused on more rock-oriented music. The label's roster was initially bolstered by The Stone Roses, but quickly expanded to include blues, acoustic, and roots music. Other artists featured early on Silvertone include John Lee Hooker, J.J. Cale and The Men They Couldn't Hang. This period also saw one of the few times that Zomba attempted cracking the classical music market. In 1992, Zomba purchased UK classical music group Conifer Classics with the aide of the group's head Alison Wenham. Though the deal seemed to be solid, Zomba sold the company to BMG in 1995. Classical music activities have remained minimal within the company since then. Building on existing publishing deals, Zomba briefly co-owned the UK label Sanctuary Records. While the co-ownership only lasted between 1989 and 1991, the two companies continued dealing together in other avenues, including a publishing deal with Sanctuary artists Iron Maiden. In 1998, Zomba purchased a 50% stake in the troubled label Volcano Entertainment (called Freeworld at the time). The label had been under financial pressure due to various reasons, including a lawsuit from flagship artist Tool. The purchase was shared with management firm Q-Prime, though shortly after they sold their half to Zomba, making Volcano a wholly owned subsidiary. The first action was to settle the lawsuit with Tool, who would go on to become another Zomba success throughout the 2000s, representing the broad stylistic reach of artists under the Zomba Group. In December 2000, Volcano Entertainment purchased Capricorn Records from Phil Walden, an independent record label launched by Walden, his brother Alan Walden and Frank Fenter in 1969. With it, the Zomba subsidiary acquired a large catalog of music as well as active bands 311, Goldfinger, Reel Big Fish, 2 Skinnee J's and the jam bands Galactic and Widespread Panic.\n\nIn 1993, Zomba created Zomba! Music Services in order to facilitate publishing rights for those in the film and television industry. The division would act as a channel through which clients could acquire products and services from any company within Zomba. Songs published by Zomba Music Publishers Ltd., or released on any of the Zomba labels, or specialty recordings owned by the division itself, could be sourced for inclusion on film soundtracks, television shows or commercials. This move gave Zomba profits by providing an accessible method of accessing the company's vast publishing catalogue.\n\nThe year 1994 saw the first of many of Zomba's successful forays into the Christian music scene with the purchase of the Brentwood Music Group. Brentwood was an established company consisting of an extensive Christian distribution network, several labels, and one of the largest music publishing divisions in printed choral music in the U.S. Expanding on the Brentwood purchase, Zomba purchased the Christian label group Reunion Records from BMG in October 1996. In 1997, Zomba purchased yet another Christian music affiliated company, the Benson Music Group, from Music Entertainment Group. Benson became Zomba's third label to focus on Christian music following Brentwood Music and Reunion Records. An important asset of the Brentwood acquisition was the publishing arm, founded in 1902, that included 46,000 copyrights from artists such as Elvis Presley, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Willie Nelson.\n\nIn reaction to the surge in Christian-oriented labels gathered over so few years, Zomba created the Provident Music Group in June 1997. The Nashville-based group was led by Jim Van Hook and was essentially a continuation of the Brentwood group and an amalgamation of the other Christian-oriented labels. The group consisted of the Benson, Brentwood and Reunion groups, as well as the Brentwood/Benson Publishing Group and newly formed Provident Music Distribution arms. This new group allowed the three main sublabels to have unified resources and distribution while still retaining their unique personalities in the market.\n\nIn 1996, Zomba acquired the Windsong Holdings which gave them control of many new companies including Windsong International, Pinnacle Entertainment and Music For Nations. It also gave them control of the established music company Rough Trade (80% of Rough Trade Records Germany/Switzerland/Austria (GSA) and 100% of Rough Trade Benelux). Rough Trade was primarily known as a distributor, but it also ran many electronic labels based in Germany. In July 1999, Rough Trade GSA was renamed Zomba Records GmbH, while the Benelux operation (which only had distribution at the time) was absorbed into Zomba Distribution. The Rough Trade name remained as an imprint of Zomba Records GmbH, but was largely abandoned by Zomba.\n\nWith the successful integration of Rough Trade into its operations in the GSA region and Benelux and to expand on recent teen pop successes, Zomba created a London-based international label group, Zomba International Records Group. Directed by Stuart Watson, the new organization allowed each new local territory to freely sign and develop acts on its own. If those artists could create a strong regional profile, it would be possible to \"export\" them to Zomba International for broader exposure. Simultaneously, it allowed Zomba artists increased international exposure. The expansion was largely unhampered, save for some legal issues with the Australian branch. Australian record company Festival Mushroom Group lost at least a dozen employees to Zomba in early 1999, and placed an injunction that stopped them from soliciting Mushroom employees, and accused former employee Scott Murphy of trying to bolster Zomba's presence while still working for Mushroom. However, the issue was resolved fairly amicably and ended with a distribution deal with BFM Distribution (a joint venture of Festival Mushroom Group and BMG).\n\nAs the record industry began evolving due to the widespread use of the Internet, and the increasing ease with which artists can record at home, Zomba made moves that illustrated their desire to change with the times. In 2000, they joined the growing list of record companies that made some music available via digital download with online distribution company Amplified Entertainment. In 2002, Zomba joined majors EMI, Universal and BMG, with approving some of their Jive catalog for release on the new DataPlay media. Though the media was largely unsuccessful, the move illustrated Zomba's competitiveness with the major labels in the growing digital world. However, a negative outcome of the changing times was the closing of some of Zomba's Battery Studios and Dreamline equipment rental businesses towards the end of 2001.\n\nAround 1993, Clive Calder began his uneasy relationship with Lou Pearlman. Pearlman had put together a new group, Backstreet Boys, which was languishing on Mercury without any hits. He presented the group to Calder along with David McPherson. Though initially uninterested due to the dominance of grunge and alternative rock, Calder thought that the group could help expand his operations overseas. Zomba bought out the boys' contract for $35,000 and moved the group over to Zomba imprint Jive. Calder immediately sent the group to Sweden and matched them with a group of producers recently found by Zomba scouts: Dag Volle and Martin Sandberg. In mid-1995, the band recorded their three songs including their first single at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm. Next Calder matched them with an old friend, Stuart Watson, who ran SWAT Enterprises, a company specializing in promotion in Asia. The group went to Asia began touring relentlessly and released their first album which sold one million copies in three weeks. In 1997, when Calder thought the grunge phenomenon had sufficiently passed, he took the group back over to the United States where their North American debut ended up selling upwards of 14 million copies, creating the first in a run of many hits that Zomba and the Backstreet Boys would enjoy together.\n\nWhile Pearlman and Watson were breaking the Backstreet Boys overseas, Jive A&R man Steve Lunt was busy in the US seeking a female star, and was greeted with 15-year-old Britney Spears. Initially horrified by Spears' karaoke demo of a Toni Braxton song sung in the wrong register, Lunt was intrigued by a brief moment at the end where he heard the \"kind of soul she had.\" As was the virtually the standard at Zomba, Lunt took Spears to in-house songwriter and producer Eric Foster White in the company's publishing division, and the two recorded \"You Got It All.\" Like the Backstreet Boys, Spears was hooked up with Cheiron producer Max Martin. Within 30 days of letting a music director at Star 100.7 in San Diego hear \"...Baby One More Time\", the song was number one on the charts in 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Zomba was involved in a \"boy band controversy\" when trying to sign another group that Pearlman had put together himself, *NSYNC. *NSYNC had recently left RCA due to allegations that Pearlman had taken approximately 50% of their profits and not the one-sixth that he had agreed to. Seeing the group as a \"free-agent,\" Jive quickly signed them and prepared to release their next album. On 12 October, Pearlman's company Trans Continental, in conjunction with RCA owner BMG Entertainment and BMG Ariola Munich sued Jive Records, Clive Calder, and the members of *NSYNC for $150 million citing, among other things, breach of contract. Pearlman sought an injunction against the release of the band's new album and that the recordings be given to him, but it was denied in court. As a response to the suit, and in reference to treatment by Trans Continental, *NSYNC released a statement citing the company's poor conduct as \"the most glaring, overt, and callous example of artist exploitation that the music industry has seen in a long time.\" The lawsuit was settled on 23 December with undisclosed terms, but left Jive free to release future *NSYNC albums.\n\nThe lawsuit, which \"Rolling Stone\" called \"the music industry's nastiest legal skirmishes in years,\" was problematic for Zomba for two main reasons. First, having heard that 'N Sync was signed to Jive, the Backstreet Boys did not want to be a part of the label anymore. Second, the lawsuit temporarily strained Zomba's relationship with BMG, whose distribution deal with Zomba was coming to a close. Jive initially announced that they would not renew their deal with BMG, but reconsidered following the lawsuit with BMG and Trans Continental. The distribution deal may have been a determining factor in the outcome of the lawsuit, since distributed Zomba product accounted for 5.5% of BMG's US market share, and company CEO Strauss Zelnick was under pressure not to lose that. They also signed a new deal with the Backstreet Boys that gave the band a 20% royalty rate.\n\nBMG had owned 25% of Zomba's publishing business since 1991 and 20% of its recording business since 1996. As part of BMG's 1996 agreement with Zomba, the music giant was required to follow through on a put option and buy the remaining shares it did not already own before 31 December 2002. In June 2002, Clive Calder decided to exercise the put option. Effective 26 November 2002, BMG Entertainment concluded its deal with Zomba for the purchase of the company's entire assets. While Calder had originally requested $3.2 billion for his shares in Zomba, valuation of the label's assets varied from $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion. Following the purchase negotiations, a price of $2.74 billion was agreed upon, the biggest purchase of an independent at the time. Zomba's sale had been the latest in a series of independent label sellouts including Island Records and Geffen Records (both sold to Universal for $300 million and $550 million respectively), and Virgin (sold for $950 million to EMI). The $2.74 billion paid for the Zomba Group was more than was paid for the purchase of many others labels including Island, Geffen, Virgin, A&M, Motown, Chrysalis, and Def Jam, combined.\n\nInitially, BMG took its time in integrating Zomba with the rest of its labels, hoping that the former independent would lift BMGs worldwide rank from fifth to fourth-largest record company. Calder resigned his position as CEO immediately after the purchase, but stayed on in an advisory position for about another year. In mid-2003, BMG began its worldwide integration of Zomba cutting hundreds of jobs through the consolidation of regional operations. While many of the key managers stayed, and the large offices in the US and the UK remained operational, all of the other regional offices were assimilated into BMG. In addition to the regional mergers, the Zomba and BMG publishing companies were integrated. The US and UK offices remained as stand-alone units, but many of the back-office functions were consolidated into BMG. The Provident Music Group, Zomba's foray into the Christian music market, was reassigned as a RCA sub-label. By 2004, the record labels were reorganized under the Zomba Label Group.\n\nIn 2004, BMG and Sony Music Entertainment merged to form Sony BMG Music Entertainment taking Zomba with it. Though the merger was plagued with controversy and eventually ended with Sony buying out BMG's stake in late 2008, Zomba executives continued to expand the company's operations in various aspects. In 2007, as part of Sony BMG integration and consolidation, RCA Music Group and Zomba Label Group merged their international, sales and field staffs to form the BMG Label Group under Sony BMG. RCA and Zomba kept separate groups under BMG, but this configuration was short-lived due to the dissolution of the Sony BMG merger. Zomba is currently owned wholly by, and operates under Sony.\n\nOn 2 November 2004 the American Federation of Musicians announced that it had entered into an agreement with Zomba. Effective 1 January 2005, the labor union covered all artists on any Zomba subsidiary labels (and any future labels) under the Federation's Sound Recording Labor Agreement. The deal ensured that all artists under the Zomba aegis would receive, for the first time, a full range of benefits and protections, among which are scale payments, industry standard working conditions and pension contributions.\n\nIn 2005, Zomba formed Zomba Gospel under the Zomba Label Group in an effort to collate its recently expanding gospel labels. Zomba's interest in gospel began in the form of a distribution deal with GospoCentric Records (and sublabel B'Rite Music) in October 2001, which Zomba later purchased in 2004. Verity Records president Max Siegel was charged with heading the new entity which included Zomba labels Verity and GospoCentric, as well as four artist owned imprints: Quiet Water Entertainment (Donald Lawrence), Fo Yo Soul Entertainment (Kirk Franklin), New Life Records (John P. Kee) and F. Hammond Music (Fred Hammond). Distribution was handled by Provident-Integrity for the Christian Bookselling Association, and through Sony Distribution (formerly Sony BMG) for the mainstream market.\n\nZomba's publishing division also continued its expansion. In 2006, Zomba Music Publishing purchased the catalogue of the UK-based Strongsongs Music Publishing from the Telstar Music Group. This large acquisition gave expanded Zomba's rights to many international hitmakers to include Metallica, Craig David and Dannii Minogue among others. Beginning with the appointment of David Mantel in 2005 as the head of Zomba Music Publishing US operations, the company began to take a different signing approach that focused on unknown or unsigned artists. Mantel's first signing was T-Pain, whose two singles \"I'm Sprung\" and \"I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)\" hit number 8 and 5 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100. This type of signing was also used in the records division were artists or producers were given their own imprint. In October 2008, Zomba made an all-inclusive multiyear joint-venture deal with Hitz Committee Entertainment, and imprint in the making for almost 5 years by Jive A&R VP Micky \"MeMpHiTz\" Wright. Beginning in 2008, Hitz Committee consists of a record label under Sony, music production, music publishing, artist and producer management, and TV and film projects.\n\nThe structure of the Zomba Group during the independent era (1975 to 2002) is difficult to pinpoint exactly due to the private nature of Clive Calder's managing style. During that period, Calder's private investment group Summer Shore NV controlled the Zomba group. The company began as Zomba Management and Publishers as early as 1975. They expanded to the US, first with a publishing sector in 1978, then a records division in 1981 while the management and publishing divisions became separate companies. Also sometime during that period, they started a production division initially called Zomba Productions Ltd., which would become Zomba Recording Corporation. From a legal standpoint, Zomba's holdings are divided into their music publishing business (Zomba Music Holdings BV) and music recording business (Zomba Record Holdings BV). The former holds only music publishing (i.e., written music) rights, while the latter holds all of the recorded music rights, along with some publishing groups acquired over the years. In addition to those two, there is another holding company called Zomba Entertainment Holdings BV.<ref name=\"woweu0304/3\"></ref> Below is a breakdown of most of the companies and divisions that have been owned by Zomba. Since the BMG integration in mid-2003, and further integration into Sony Music in early 2009, the exact status of some companies is not known. As much detail has been provided to illustrate the current status of these companies.\n\nZomba labels were operated under the Zomba Label Group from approximately 2004 until 2009 (now part of the RCA/Jive Label Group. The Provident Label Group contained other labels after its purchase in 1997, but is no longer a part of Zomba. The Windsong purchase gave Zomba control of labels through a variety of company structures including Pinnacle and Rough Trade, however, some of these labels are no longer a part of Zomba. These three groups are organized separately below, followed by a list of inactive or formerly owned labels from various periods.\n\nZomba's first, and flagship label is Jive, formed in 1981. Since then, Zomba has acquired and created a variety of labels and label groups that either operate independently from, or under Jive. During its independent period, the various record labels under Zomba all reported directly to a records division. There was no formal public face for the labels until BMG formed Zomba Label Group in 2004. Though the term \"Zomba label group\" or \"Zomba Group records division\" had been used previously to refer to the various labels owned by the company, it wasn't until then that an actual company was created to control the labels specifically. The Zomba Recording Corporation continues to coordinate production activities on many Zomba subsidiary releases.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1987, Zomba labels were distributed by Arista. Following that, Zomba signed a deal with RCA for distribution that lasted until 1991. The end of the deal coincided with BMG purchasing a large share of RCA and a deal with BMG was signed for distribution. BMG remained the North American distributor for Zomba until after the purchase in 2002, however, other regions had various other distributors over time. EMI became an important distributor for Zomba in Europe via Virgin Records, but distribution details are listed below in the Regional Branches section. Zomba only controls one small vinyl pressing plant, therefore, most of their manufacturing has been outsourced to companies such as Sonopress (BMG affiliated), Sony and Technicolor.\n\nIn 1996, Zomba acquired 75% of UK distributor and label group Pinnacle, 80% of the Rough Trade label and distribution in the Germany/Switzerland/Austria (GSA) region, and 100% of Rough Trade Benelux. Effective 8 July 1999 Rough Trade Records was renamed Zomba Records GmbH and the Rough Trade sales and distribution arm was renamed Zomba Distribution, operating as a division of Zomba Records GmbH. As of the BMG purchase, Zomba conducted its own distribution in the UK (with Pinnacle), Germany, Austria and Benelux (all with Zomba Distribution). In those areas, Zomba also distributed for other, smaller independent labels. In France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, Zomba had its own marketing and sales, however, distribution was handled by EMI (through Virgin in most cases). In Finland and Greece, Zomba material was exclusively licensed to EMI who controlled marketing, sales and distribution. North American distribution has almost exclusively been with BMG. Following the BMG purchase in December 2002 and subsequent integration in June 2003 and the end of contracts with EMI (also in June), all distribution has been handled by the local BMG companies. When BMG merged with Sony, Sony BMG became Zomba's distributor from 2004 until early 2009. Since then, Zomba products have been distributed by Sony Music since Sony purchased BMG's interest in their joint-venture.\n\nZomba Recording Corporation (previously Zomba Productions Ltd., and sometimes colloquially referred to as Zomba Records) is a music company and division of the Zomba Group. The US affiliate is Zomba Recordings LLC and the UK affiliate is Zomba Records Ltd. The company also runs an investment and financial services company called Zomba Ventures Inc.<ref name=\"wow0405/2\"></ref><ref name=\"wow0506/2\"></ref>\n\nPrimarily a production company, Zomba Recording Corporation coordinates various activities for the recording process including hiring musicians, managing studios, and organizing production, mixing and mastering personnel. Recordings made under the coordination or supervision of this division are usually marked with the phrase \"An Original Sound Recording Made by Zomba Recording Corporation (or Zomba Recordings LLC/Zomba Records Limited/Zomba Productions Limited).\" While not strictly a record label, Zomba Recording Corporation appears on most of the various sublabels that Zomba owns. Additionally, the minimal manufacturing as well as some distribution that Zomba does on its own is run through this company.\n\nBattery Studios is the name of Zomba Recording Corporation's chain of multi-room facilities often used in the production of Zomba artists. The main facility, located in New York City, is constantly associated with high-profile clients including R. Kelly, 'N Sync and Britney Spears. The studio features three recording and mixing studios with SSL 9000, SSL 4064 G+ and Euphonix CS3000 consoles and Pro Tools MIXplus systems. Battery Studios was originally opened in London before the New York branch existed, and at one point consisted of six locations in London, four New York locations, two Nashville locations, and one location in Chicago. However, Zomba closed its London branches towards the end of 2001 and the others followed soon after leaving only an unknown number of New York locations. In addition to Battery studios, Zomba Recording Corporation began a relationship with the established Swedish studio Cheiron Studios and its production personnel. The studio had operated since the mid eighties (as SweMix), and from 1996 until its closure in 2000 it shared a joint production and publishing venture with the Zomba Group. Apart from the actual studio, the venture included a production team that helped forge the sounds of Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, and 'N Sync.\n\nIn addition to recording studios, Zomba Recording Corporation operated Dreamhire Professional audio Rentals. Dreamhire opened in 1984 with operations in London, New York City (1989) and Nashville (1988). The London branch closed in 2001 followed by Nashville in 2003. Dreamhire also included Hilton Sound, a hire operation purchased by Zomba in 1996. Since November 2003 following the BMG purchase, Dreamhire is no longer a part of Zomba and runs independently as Dreamhire LLC from one location in New York City, owned by Chris Dunn, ex-bass guitarist from UK band (City Boy (band)) which recorded 5 albums all produced by Mutt Lange.\n\nDuring its existence, the Zomba Label Group featured all of the Zomba-related labels that BMG purchased in 2002. The current Battery Records is unrelated to the previous defunct imprint of the same name. Listed below is the structure of the Zomba Label Group immediately before its rebranding and dissolution in 2009.\n\nThe Provident Music Group was created by Zomba in 1997 as an amalgamation of their Christian music activities. Zomba had purchased Brentwood Music Group in February 1994 and founder Jim Van Cook was charged with leading the new music group. The group consisted of three sections: Provident Label Group, Provident-Integrity Distribution and the Brentwood/Benson Publishing Group.\n\nAs part of the music group, Zomba amalgamated their Christian labels under the Provident Label Group. The new group initially consisted of Brentwood Records, Benson Records and Reunion Records, though Brentwood was shut down in 2001. Since then, other labels have been added. Under Zomba, the Provident Label Group had this configuration:\n\nAfter BMG bought Zomba in 2002 and integrated the company in June 2003, the Provident Music Group was moved under the aegis of RCA with the exception of the Publishing division which was moved under BMG Publishing (Provident would later create its own publishing division, Essential Music Publishing, with no connection to Zomba). BMG Publishing was subsequently sold to Universal, along with Brentwood/Benson. In 2008, when Sony bought Bertelsmann's stake in their joint Sony BMG venture, the rest of Provident became part of Sony Music Nashville.\n\nIn 1996, Zomba acquired the holdings of Windsong International. The deal gave the following controlling interests to Zomba:\n\nRough Trade GSA was renamed Zomba Records GmbH, while the Benelux operation (which only had distribution at the time) was absorbed into Zomba Distribution. The Rough Trade name only remained as an imprint of Zomba Records GmbH. Before being absorbed into BMG's operations, Zomba Records GmbH consisted of the following regional labels, most of which focused on electronic dance music:\nZomba Records GmbH was integrated into BMG's German operation along with the other regional offices. The Rough Trade name was later reacquired by Geoff Travis and Jeanette Lee who eventually continued it independently. When BMG restructured Zomba in 2003, Windsong/Pinnacle was moved under Bertelsmann's Arvato AG. Through a management buyout, Windsong/Pinnacle gained its independence in early 2008, but was forced into administration late in the year due to the economic crisis.\n\nZomba International Records Group managed the various regional branches opened as early as 1997 and as late as 2003. The group served to solidify the operations in these regions, some of which already had small offices with activities from scouting, promoting (such as Sweden), or as much as distribution for smaller labels or operating a few regional record labels (such as Germany). Following the BMG purchase, all of the remaining regional labels (with the exception of the main US and UK offices) and the Zomba International Records Group activities were merged with their respective local BMG offices in mid-2003.\n\nAside from those listed above, other labels that have been associated with Zomba over the years are listed below.\n\n\nZomba Music Publishing Ltd. (sometimes colloquially referred to as Zomba Music or Zomba Music Publishing Group) is the publishing division of the Zomba Group of Companies. Initially known as Zomba Enterprises Inc., the division officially changed names in 1994 and became the Zomba umbrella company for publishing. Since then, Zomba Enterprises is the name used for Zomba's ASCAP affiliate, while Zomba Music Inc. is the name of the BMI affiliate. The holding company that controls most Zomba publishing interests is called Zomba Music Holdings BV. David Mantel has been the president of Zomba Music Publishing since 2005, when he took over for Richard Blackstone. Tim Smith is the GM of the UK affiliate Zomba Music Publishing Ltd. There are various other publishing entities under Zomba, some of which are vast libraries acquired over the years, and some of which are small groups, sometimes representing a single artist. Below is a list of Zomba's publishing subsidiaries:\n\n\nZomba has limited activity in the classical music publishing sector, however, they are quite active in the pop music publishing and production music. At the time of the BMG purchase, Zomba had pop music publishing operations located in the UK and Benelux, while every other territory was sub-published with BMG. Production music operations were located in the UK and France with smaller operations in Sweden and the Netherlands. In Germany and Austria, Zomba and BMG owned publishing rights through jointly-owned companies. Finally, in Spain and Italy, Zomba compositions were licensed exclusively to BMG.\n\nIn mid-2003, BMG integrated Zomba's publishing to form BMG-Zomba Music Publishers. In 2007, Vivendi purchased the BMG-Zomba publishing company and placed it within Universal Music Publishing Group, becoming the world's largest music publishing business. For antitrust reasons, Universal divested the European rights to the Zomba catalogue to a new company named Imagem. In 2017, Imagem was acquired by Concord Music Group.\n\nZomba's first enterprise was a management company in London called Zomba Management and Publishers, with Mutt Lange as one of their first clients. His success allowed the company to expand, and eventually the companies split into two entities, creating Zomba Management. Zomba management represents music producers and artists. Zomba Screen Music was formed in 1997 as management company for film composers. In May 2001, Zomba created Ingenuity Entertainment a full-service management company for artists, producers, composers and music supervisors in the film and television industries. The Los Angeles-based company serviced both new and veteran artists, offering music production and business affairs services. Ingenuity Entertainment combined a recently formed management firm, also called Ingenuity, with Zomba Screen Music.\n\nMost of Zomba's activities in the film and television industry are music related. Zomba Screen Music is their full-service management company for film and television composers. In addition to management, Zomba! Music Services was formed in 1989 as a division offering prerecorded music and publishing services for soundtracks, television and commercials. This also had the effect of promoting Zomba music through the television and film industry. In 1995, Zomba purchased the well-established Segue Music Inc., a film and television music editing company providing music supervision, temp tracks, prerecords, playbacks and soundtrack production. Zomba also had a joint operation with Portman Entertainment called Portman Music, a soundtrack related company Coombe Music International Ltd. as well as a small film production company Zomba Films. In 2005, Zomba began SEE Music, a joint venture with the recently combined BMG/Zomba Publishing and FirstCom Music specifically for motion picture advertising.\n\n\n\n"}

It has about one thousand students of ages eleven to eighteen, and specialist-school status as a Music College. The school has long been associated with the advancement of women's education.\n\nFounded in 1871 by the suffragist Frances Mary Buss, who also founded North London Collegiate School, the Camden School for Girls was one of the first girls' schools in England. Although not a fee-paying school by then, girls in the mid-20th century wore a traditional uniform of dark green, with blue and green striped ties. The blazer badge showed a type of ancient sailing ship called a \"buss\" to commemorate the founder's surname, with the motto 'Onwards and Upwards'. Although no entry exams were held, in its pre-comprehensive era, entrance was by interview.\n\nOne of its most formative headmistresses, Doris Burchell, took on the school in the post war years and developed its renowned strengths in both science and music, overseeing a massive amount of new building on the site. The Sir John Cockcroft science wing was built from funds raised by many means, including a series of Celebrity Concerts held at the school and involving many eminent musicians. A grammar school for much of the 20th century, it became comprehensive in 1976, although only year by year. It was not fully comprehensive until 1981. The school was damaged in the war but rebuilt in 1957, the architect being John Eastwick-Field OBE. In 1973 the assembly hall roof collapsed following deterioration of its roof beams due to problems with the high-alumina cement concrete used.\n\nA 1999 Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) report called it \"a unique and very effective school in many ways.\" Another, written in March 2005, said it was an \"outstanding school with excellent features,\" and the most recent report said that it \"rightly deserves the outstanding\nreputation it has among parents and in the community.\" Its GCSE results are excellent, and its A-level results are the best in the Camden LEA outside the private sector.\n\nThe following people were educated at the Camden School for Girls. Some of them only attended the sixth form.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2196410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196410", "title": "Jordan Downs", "text": "Jordan Downs\n\nJordan Downs is a 700-unit public housing apartment complex in Watts, Los Angeles, California, next to David Starr Jordan High School. It consists of 103 buildings with townhouse style units ranging from one bedroom to five bedrooms. The complex is owned and managed by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA).\n\nThe complex is bounded by Grape Street to the west, 97th Street to the north, Alameda Street to the east, and 103rd Street to the south. This large area had been used as a truck farm for years and during the second World War it supplied vegetables for the surrounding communities of Watts, South Gate and Lynwood.\n\nFirst opened in May 1944, the complex was originally developed as semi-permanent housing for war workers during World War II. In the early 1950s, HACLA converted it to public housing; it was among the last of the public housing projects in Watts to be opened for that purpose. It opened in 1955, shortly after new mayor Norris Poulson ended all new public housing in the city.\n\nThe development, like others in the area, began partially integrated; however, its tenancy rapidly became majority black, approaching 100% by the mid-1960s. This rapid change occurred for a number of reasons. Many of the veterans who still lived in the projects in the early 1950s moved out as they were able to purchase homes. Blacks, still migrating west after the war ended, gravitated toward areas like Watts that already had sizeable black populations. In addition, at least in the first decade of the post-war period, restrictive covenants helped channel recent migrants into Watts and away from nearby suburban cities such as Compton.\nAcross the next four decades, Jordan Downs and the other project houses came to be seen as microcosms of the ills of society: either of the dependency of individuals on the welfare state, as conservatives argued, or of institutional racism, lack of access to education and jobs, and the cycle of poverty, as liberals argued. The rapid decrease in manufacturing jobs in Los Angeles depressed the area; at the same time, the concentration of impoverished citizens, combined with a pervasive sense of disenfranchisement and official indifference or hostility, made the housing projects likely breeding-grounds for crime. Jordan Downs was one of the flashpoints of the 1965 Watts riots. Like the other housing projects, Jordan Downs benefited relatively little from the influx of federal money and attention that followed the riots. In the seventies and eighties, despair about the post-war model of public housing and declining federal spending in this area served to further dilapidate this and the other area projects.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Jordan Downs was probably most famous among the general public as one of the homes to the newly prominent street gangs: in this case, the Crip gang named after Grape Street. In 1989, claiming that HACLA had failed to improve quality of life at the project, executive director Leila Gonzalez-Correa announced plans to sell the project to a private developer at market value. The plan was intended to provide a fresh influx of money while preserving the land as low-income housing. The plan was eventually cancelled in the face of opposition from residents and the Los Angeles City Council; potential buyers also noted that the security and insurance risks associated with the project would be likely to make Jordan Downs an unprofitable investment. The controversy contributed to Gonzalez-Correa's departure from the housing authority at the end of 1989.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Jordan Downs witnessed the same social changes that marked the city as a whole. The changing demographics of Watts were reflected in tenancy at the project, as Latin American tenants began to make inroads into the long-sizeable black majority at the facility. This transformation, though generally peaceful, was accompanied by occasional tension.\n\nThe Grape Street Crips wore purple bandanas in their left pocket. They were key players in both the Watts truce that preceded the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the more general truce agreed to in the wake of the riots. As a result, Jordan Downs was comparatively peaceful for the balance of the 1990s. The resurgence of gang violence in the new century, combined with steep cutbacks in police patrols, has led to a steady increase in gang violence but has decreased rapidly in the late 2000s due to numerous police raids.\n\nJordan Downs is currently under construction in completely transforming the projects into a modern urban village with new apartment complexes, new restaurants, retail stores and parks.\n\nThe complex is featured in the movie \"Menace II Society\".\n\n\n\n\nLos Angeles Police Department operates the nearby Southeast Community Police Station .\n\nJordan Downs residents are zoned to the following public schools:\n\nAll three are in the Los Angeles Unified School District.\n\nThe Hughes Brothers film \"Menace II Society\" was filmed in parts of Jordan Downs.\n"}

The ancient cities of Canopus, Heracleion and Menouthis lie submerged beneath the waters of the bay. In 1798 it was the site of the Battle of the Nile, a naval battle fought between the British Royal Navy and the Navy of the French First Republic. The bay contains a natural gas field, discovered in the 1970s.\n\nAbu Qir Bay lies approximately 20 kilometres (≈12 miles) east of Alexandria, bounded to the southwest by the Abu Qir headland, on which the town of Abu Qir is situated, and to the northeast by the Rosetta mouth of the Nile. The bay is a highly fertile Egyptian coastal region but suffers from acute eutrophication and pollution from untreated industrial and domestic waste. The ABU QIR Fertilizers and Chemicals Industries Company, a large producer of nitrogen fertilizer, is located on the bay.\n\nIn ancient times Abu Qir Bay was surrounded by marshland and contained several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, port cities were established on the bay. The bay now contains the underwater archaeological sites of three cities from the pre-Hellenistic, Hellenistic and Roman periods. The Eastern part of ancient city of Canopus is submerged in the bay, along with the remains of Menouthis and its sister-city Herakleion–Thonis which now lies 7 kilometres offshore. They were excavated by French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio.\n\nIn July 2019, a smaller Greek temple and ancient granite columns, treasure-laden ships, along with bronze coins from the reign of Ptolemy II, pottery dating back to the third and fourth centuries BC were found at the sunken city of Heracleion, known as Egypt’s Atlantis. The investigations were conducted by Egyptian and European divers led by the underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio. They also uncovered an absolutely devastated historic underwater temple (city’s main temple) off Egypt's north coast.\n\nA number of sunken ships have been excavated from the bay, including a ceremonial boat (Neshmet boat) dedicated to Osiris and several Roman era ships.\n\nClassical sources indicate that the Canopic branch of the Nile delta once entered the sea in the vicinity of Heracleion or Eastern Canopus. A combination of Islamic texts and investigation using geoarchaeology suggest that this branch was still in existence in the eighth century, when a major inundation caused Eastern Canopus to sink into the bay. The Canopic branch subsequently declined and eventually became closed.\n\nOn August 1, 1798, Horatio Nelson fought the naval \"Battle of the Nile\", often referred to as the \"Battle of Aboukir Bay\". (Not to be confused with the Battle of Abukir (1799) and the Battle of Abukir (1801).) \n\nOn 1 March 1801, some 70 British warships, together with transports carrying 16,000 troops, anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria. The intent was to defeat the French expeditionary force that had remained in Egypt after Napoleon's return to France. \n\nBad weather delayed disembarkation by a week but, on 8 March, Captain Alexander Cochrane of HMS \"Ajax\" deployed 320 boats, in double line abreast, to bring the troops ashore. French shore batteries opposed the landing, but the British were able to drive them back and, by the next day, all of Sir Ralph Abercromby's British army was ashore. The British then defeated the French army at the Battle of Alexandria.

In Pharaonic times the island lay on a primary commercial route to the Nile River and became a major religious and commercial centre. There is archaeological evidence that a high-status necropolis was sited on the island. During the Ptolemaic Kingdom the island was fortified.\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Nile in 1798, a number of British dead were buried on the island. Their graves were discovered in 2000.

She was the daughter of the philologist Eugene Polydouris and Kyriaki Markatou, a woman with early feminist beliefs. She completed her high school studies in Kalamata, and had also gone to school in Gytheio and Filiatra, as well as in Arsakeio in Athens for two years. She was a contemporary of Kostas Karyotakis, with whom she had a desperate but incomplete love affair. Although she wrote poetry from an early age, her most important poems were written during the last four years of her life, when, suffering from tuberculosis, she was secluded in an Athens Sanatorium, where she died in 1930.\n\nShe first appeared in the Literary world at age 14 with the prose poem “The Pain of the Mother”, which refers to the death of a sailor who was washed up on the shores of Filiatra and is influenced by the lamentations heard in Mani Peninsula. At sixteen, she was appointed to the Prefecture of Messenia and also expressed keen interest in The woman question. In 1920, during the time period of forty days, both her parents died.\n\nIn 1921, she was transferred to the Prefecture of Athens while enrolled at the Law School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Kostas Karyotakis, a fellow poet of the time, was working at the same service sector. After their encounter, a fierce love developed, which did not last long but decisively influenced her life and work.\n\nThey first met in January 1922. Polydouri was then 20 years old, while Karyotakis was 26. She had published some juvenilia poems while he had published two poetry collections – \"The pain of Men and things\" (1919) and \"Nepenthe\" (1921) – and had already won the respect of some critics and fellow-craftsmen.\n\nIn the summer of 1922, Karyotakis discovered that he suffered from syphilis, a disease that was incurable and bore social stigma. He immediately informed Polydouri about this and asked her to end their relationship. She proposed to marry without having children, but he was too proud to accept the sacrifice. Maria doubted his sincerity and felt that his illness was a pretext to leave her.\n\nIn 1924, she met Aristotelis Georgiou, a lawyer who had just returned from Paris. Polydouri got engaged to him in early 1925.\n\nDespite the dedication to her fiancé, Polydouri could not concentrate seriously in any activity. She lost her job in the public sector after repeated absences and dropped out of Law School. She studied at the Kounallaki Drama School and even managed to appear as an actress in a play, \"The Little Rag\", for which she had the lead role.\n\nIn the summer of 1926, she broke off her engagement and left for Paris. She studied dressmaking but could not work because she contracted tuberculosis. She returned to Athens in 1928 and was hospitalized at Sotiria Hospital, where she learned about the suicide of her former lover, Kostas Karyotakis. In the same year, she released her first poetry collection \"The Chirps that faint\" and in 1929 the second, \"Echo over chaos\". Polydouri left two prose works, her diary and an untitled novel in which she attacked the conservatism and hypocrisy of the time. She died of tuberculosis on the morning of April 29, 1930, after a series of morphine injections that were given to her by a friend in Christomanos Clinic.\n\nMaria Polydouri belongs to the generation of 1920, which fostered the feeling of dissatisfaction and decline. Love and death are the two axes around which her poetry revolves. Her poetry is a concise source of lyricism that breaks in deep sorrow and sometimes grief, with obvious influences from the love of her life, Kostas Karyotakis, but also laments from Mani. Polydouri's affective and emotional exacerbations often cover some technical weaknesses and songwriting amenities.\n\nCritic and poet Kostas Stergiopoulos wrote:\n\n\"\"Maria Polydouri used to write her poems as if she was writing her personal diary. The transmutation happened automatically and effortlessly. To Polydouri, expression meant straight transcribing from the events occurring in her emotional world to the poetic language with all the idealizations and exaggerations her romantic nature dictated to her\".\"\n\nThe first article about Maria Polydouri based on her archives and diary belongs to Vasiliki Bobou-Stamati and is published in Elliniki Dimiourgia (1954), p. 617-624. The Collected Works of Maria Polydouri released for the first time in the 1960s by Estia Press, curated by Lili Zografou. Since then they have been republished by various publishers. The writer and poet Kostis Gimossoulis has written a fictional biography titled \"Raining light\". Her poems have been set to music by Greek composers, classical artists and rock – including Menelaos Palladio, Kostis Kritsotakis, Nikos Mamangakis, Yiannis Spanos, Notis Mavroudis, George Arkomanis, Dimitris Papadimitriou, Michalis Koumbios, Stelios Botonakis and band \"Plinthetes\" and \" Iliodromio \"and the composer Nikos Fylaktos with voice and piano.\n\nIn 2009, she was portrayed by Maria Kitsiou in the Greek TV series Karyotakis (TV series), aired by ERT1.\n\nCollections:\nHer poems (or at least a part of them) have been translated to Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Macedonian, Romanian, Spanish and Swedish.\n"}

Among otherwise-compatible cleats, there is an important distinction between black \"single release\" cleats (SM-SH51) and silver \"multi release\" cleats (SM-SH56). The former can only be released from the pedal by twisting the heel outwards, while the latter can also be released by a sharp pull upwards and are therefore easier to use for novices.\n\nThere is a small allen key adjustment for the strength of heel twist to release, so beginners can have it 'soft' and easy to get out, and then tighten it up as they progress.\n"}

Furthermore, he expressed contempt towards capitalism, which he dismissed as inextricably linked to materialism. Akhenaten stated that his music was intended to give others strength to live in a world compromised by materialism and irrational religious ideology.\n\nSome of the lyrics on early Judas Iscariot albums are borrowed from the works of English poet and Christian mystic William Blake, as well as from English poet Percy Bysshe Shelly, fundamental for understanding the connection between Dark Romanticism, the esoteric and their connection to heavy metal lyrics.\n\nAkhenaten repeatedly denied association with the National Socialist black metal movement. In an interview he stated \"Judas Iscariot is no Nazi band. I myself am no Nazi either [...] If other bands think they have to include politics into their music, it's their business, but this has nothing to do with my band.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During Mu'awiya's governorship of Syria (639–661), Abd al-Rahman commanded a number of campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and defended the Upper Mesopotamian frontier from the Iraq-based forces of Caliph Ali (). He fought reputably against the latter at the Battle of Siffin in 657 and continued his governorship of Homs and campaigns against the Byzantines after Mu'awiya became caliph in 661. His battlefield reputation and descent from his father, the prominent general Khalid ibn al-Walid, made him particularly popular among the Arabs of Syria. Mu'awiya ultimately perceived him as a potential rival of his own son Yazid, who he was grooming as his successor, which led the caliph to allegedly order Abd al-Rahman's poisoning in 666.\n\nAbd al-Rahman was born in , the son of the prominent Muslim general and member of the Qurayshi clan of Banu Makhzum, Khalid ibn al-Walid. Abd al-Rahman's mother was Khalid's wife Asma, the daughter of Anas ibn Mudrik, a prominent chieftain and poet of the Khath'am tribe who was active during the pre-Islamic period and died several years after the advent of Islam in the 620s. Abd al-Rahman likely entered military service during the caliphate of Uthman (). During Uthman's reign, he was appointed the governor of Jund Hims (military district of Homs) by Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, the overall governor of the province of Syria. Abd al-Rahman was dispatched by Mu'awiya to command a number of military campaigns against the Byzantines in Anatolia and was referred to in the Greek sources \"Abderachman\". He fended off a raid against Mu'awiya's territory in the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) by the Iraqi forces of Caliph Ali () in 657. Later that year, Abd al-Rahman served as a commander in the Syrian army of Mu'awiya against Ali at the Battle of Siffin, where he fought with distinction and held the banner of the Syrians. His brother Muhajir fought for Ali's side in the same battle and was killed. During the subsequent arbitration talks in Adhruh or Dumat al-Jandal in 658 or 659 between the representatives of Ali and Mu'awiya, Abd al-Rahman was among those in the latter's faction to witness the arbitration document.\n\nAbd al-Rahman continued as governor of Jund Hims during the caliphate of Mu'awiya beginning in 661. In 664/665 and 665/666, he led the winter campaigns against the Byzantines along the Anatolian front. According to the Muslim traditional sources, Abd al-Rahman posed a threat to Mu'awiya's ambitions to appoint his own Yazid as his successor and the caliph resolved to eliminate him. At the time, he was the last surviving son of Khalid ibn al-Walid, his descent from the reputable general and his own valor and effectiveness fighting the Byzantines had endeared him to the Syrian Arabs. To that end, he had his Christian physician Ibn Uthal poison Abd al-Rahman upon the latter's return to Homs from the Byzantine front in 666. The physician was later killed by a kinsman of Abd al-Rahman called Khalid, who was either his own son or the son of his brother Muhajir. This Khalid was consequently imprisoned and fined Ibn Uthal's blood money by Mu'awiya to protect him from potential retaliation. Relations between the influential Banu Makhzum, who were mostly concentrated in the Hejaz (western Arabia), and Mu'awiya deteriorated as a result of Abd al-Rahman's alleged poisoning. The Orientalist historian Henri Lammens doubts the reliability of this narrative, which he relates to the anti-Christian violence in Homs around that time.\n\nThe line of Khalid ibn al-Walid died out with the deaths of Abd al-Rahman's roughly forty male descendants as a result of a plague in Syria toward the end of the Umayyad period (661–750). Abd al-Rahman is buried alongside his father and one of his father's wives, Fadda, in Homs. In 1908, the Ottoman rulers of Syria built the Khalid ibn al-Walid Mosque around the site claimed since at least the 12th century to contain their graves.\n\n\n\nal"}

He appeared in science fiction productions, including \"Battlestar Galactica\" (as Wolfe) and its sequel series \"Galactica 1980\" (as Commander Xaviar). He also appeared in such shows as \"Starsky and Hutch\", \"Baretta\", \"T. J. Hooker\", \"Blue Thunder\", \"Airwolf\", \"The A-Team\", \"Charmed\" and \"\".\n\nRichard Hugh Lynch was born on February 12, 1940 (sometimes incorrectly cited as 1936) in Brooklyn, New York City to Catholic parents of Irish descent. His younger brother is actor Barry Lynch. Lynch served in the United States Marine Corps for four years.\n\nLynch's distinct scarred appearance made him a popular nemesis, and he can be seen in more than 100 film and television performances. The scars came from a 1967 incident in New York's Central Park in which, under the influence of drugs, he set himself on fire, burning more than 70% of his body. He spent a year in recovery, gave up drug use and ultimately began training at The Actors Studio and at the HB Studio. In 1970, he co-starred with Robert De Niro, Sally Kirkland and Diane Ladd in the short-lived off-Broadway play \"One Night Stands of a Noisy Passenger,\" written by Shelley Winters. He often played a villain in features, including \"Scarecrow\", which marked his film debut, \"The Seven-Ups\", \"Bad Dreams\", \"The Sword and the Sorcerer\", and \"Little Nikita\".\n\nIn 1982, Lynch won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the evil King Cromwell in \"The Sword and the Sorcerer\". Although Richard Lynch is best known for playing villains, he was cast as the president of the United States in the 2007 film \"Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy\". Lynch starred alongside Judson Scott in the 1982 short-lived science fiction TV series \"The Phoenix\".\n\nIn addition to acting, Lynch was a musician, and he played the saxophone, guitar, piano, and flute. He held Irish citizenship through his Irish-born parents and was a frequent visitor to Ireland. He starred together with brother Barry in the films \"Nightforce\" and \"Total Force\". Lynch's wife Lily starred with him in the film \"Breaking the Silence\" (1998) and son Christopher Lynch appeared with him in the science fiction film \"Trancers II\". In 1977, Richard Lynch shared the stage with actor Al Pacino, a close friend, in the Broadway play \"The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel.\" Lynch played a Vietnam veteran who used a wheelchair, and was nominated for a Tony in 1977.\n\nThrough the years, Lynch worked with friend and colleague Don Calfa in the films \"Necronomicon\" (1993), \"Toughguy\" (1995), \"Corpses Are Forever\" (2003), and \"Lewisburg\" (2009).\n\nLynch married twice — once to Béatrix Lynch (their son Christopher died in 2005 from pneumonia), and later to Lily Lynch.\n\nLynch's body was found in his home in Yucca Valley, California on June 19, 2012.

{"id": "2196476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196476", "title": "Ninjam", "text": "Ninjam\n\nNINJAM stands for \"Novel Intervallic Network Jamming Architecture for Music\". The software and systems comprising NINJAM provide a non-realtime mechanism for exchanging audio data across the internet, with a synchronisation mechanism based on musical form. It provides a way for musicians to \"jam\" (improvise) together over the Internet; it pioneered the concept of \"virtual-time\" jamming. It was originally developed by Brennan Underwood, Justin Frankel, and Tom Pepper.\n\nCreating music naturally relies on players' ability to keep time with each other. Latency between players causes natural time keeping to be thrown awry. The internet does not provide a low-latency data exchange mechanism that can be used over global distances.\nIn order to approach latency-free collaboration, NINJAM extends the latency, by delaying all received audio until it can be synchronised with other players. The delay is based on the musical form. This synchronisation means that each player hears the others in a session and can play along with them. NINJAM defines the form in terms of the \"interval\" - the number of beats to be recorded before synchronising with other players. For example, with an interval of 16, four bars of common time would be recorded from each player, then played back to all others.\n\nThe process was described in \"Wired\" as \"glitch-free\", and \"designed for musicians who enjoy realtime collaboration.\" In \"MIT Technology Review\", the software's users are described as \"really loyal\" due to its free and open source status.\nOther music product vendors have added support for NINJAM; Expert Sleepers, a vendor of electronic music hardware and software, added plugin support for NINJAM in 2006.\n\nEach player in a NINJAM session feeds audio data from their client to a server via a TCP/IP connection to a specific port (commonly in the range 2049 upwards, depending on the host).\n\nThe \"client\" here is only the component that the player uses to connect to a NINJAM server, encode and transmit their audio stream, receive and decode remote players' streams and handle the chat (IRC-like) session. Each player will also need some way of feeding audio information to the NINJAM client - either by using the client as a plugin in a DAW or by using the standalone version with a direct audio input.\n\nEach client's data is synchronised against a distributed clock. This clocking is then used to distribute the data out to all the other clients so that they can play all the remote streams in sync. The server does little apart from manage connections, chat and data streaming.\n\nAll clients feed data at 0 dB to the server, regardless of local monitoring levels. When setting up, the NINJAM client \"local\" level is set to 0 dB. \"Local\" does not affect transmitted volume. The slider labelled \"local\" only affects what the user hears locally, not what others hear. The user must adjust their input level - before the NINJAM client in the signal path - to affect what remote players are hearing. There is limited headroom in an audio channel, so it is considered good practice never to let audio level peak above 12 dB, and to set one's \"loud\" level at around 18 dB; this ensures space in the mix for others.\n\nVST effects are a commonly used option (based on number of posts on the NINJAM support forums) but requires that the user install REAPER.\n\nDerived from the Open Source Standalone version, works on Mac AU hosts. Similar considerations to REAPER-tied VST effect above.\n\nStandalone clients are available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. As the Linux version works with JACK, it can have audio routed to it from any JACK client. On Windows, use with virtual audio sources is problematic as there is no comparatively easy routing mechanism. Hence it is more suited to real instruments, where it provides a simpler alternative to the complexity of running a DAW just to access NINJAM.\n\nMore detailed set-up and configuration is available on the NINJAM web site.\n\nAccording to Cockos, of bandwidth requirements, outbound bandwidth is the major requirement. A 4-person session will require approximately 768kbit/s of outbound and 240kbit/s of inbound bandwidth. An 8-person session will require approximately 3Mbit/s of outbound (and 600kbit/s inbound) bandwidth.\n\nWindows 2000 or later, CPU 500 MHz, RAM 4MB, NINJAM v0.06\n\nOS X 10.3 or later, G3. RAM 4MB NINJAM v0.01a ALPHA for OS X\n\nIt is claimed that the server source code compiles on Linux, FreeBSD, Darwin/OS X, and Windows. There is no information available regarding what versions of Linux & FreeBSD are required nor of the hardware required to support the application running under those OS's.\n\nThis is a GPL project, so source code is available. Development appears to have stopped in 2005 for the client and 2007 for the server, but since 2012 new clients (wahjam, Jamtaba, Zenjam and Ninjam-js) have been created.\nThe Cockos Ninjam page lists the github page justinfrankel/ninjam as the \"official github mirror,\" and that page shows a commit in late April, 2020.\n\nThe NINJAM servers hosted by Cockos record and index their content at NINJAM AutoSong under the Creative Commons license; the music files are hosted at The Internet Archive. As of January 2010 there were over 23,000 hours of content, or approximately 1.2TB. As of March 2012, recording activity is ongoing.\n"}

At its peak, Turner South reached approximately eight million subscribers across a six-state region comprising Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, and portions of western North Carolina (roughly from Asheville to Charlotte).\n\nThe channel launched on October 1, 1999 as the first regional entertainment network developed especially for viewers in the southern United States. Turner South's programming consisted of a mix of movies, drama series, sitcoms, regional news updates, and unique original programming. It also carried telecasts of professional sporting events from the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball, Atlanta Hawks NBA, and Atlanta Thrashers NHL franchises, all of which were owned by the Turner Broadcasting System at the network's launch.\n\nTurner South's original programs could be broadly termed \"southern lifestyle\", including cooking and gardening shows. The sitcoms and dramas featured on the network (such as \"Major Dad\" and \"In the Heat of the Night\") also tended to appeal to Southerners, or were set in the South. Other series included \"Liars & Legends\" and \"Off The Menu\" which was based out of the Commander's Palace restaurant in New Orleans. Beginning in 2002, the channel also aired a live simulcast of radio program \"The Rick and Bubba Show\".\n\nNews Corporation filed a lawsuit against Turner Broadcasting and its corporate parent Time Warner in a Georgia Superior Court on June 15, 1999, citing that the plans Turner had unveiled to carry sports events on Turner South violated a non-compete agreement that the two companies signed as part of News Corporation's $65 million purchase of SportSouth (now Fox Sports South) in 1996, which prohibited Turner from launching a regional sports network in the southeastern United States until 2008. The suit was settled out of court with undisclosed terms.\n\nOn February 23, 2006, Fox Cable Networks, a subsidiary of News Corporation, agreed to purchase Turner South, for a reported $375 million. On May 1, 2006, Fox took over operations of the cable network, and the bulk of the Turner South schedule, including \"Rick and Bubba\" and the movie blocks, was discontinued. During the brief transition period which followed, repeats of Turner South's lifestyle and how-to programming (including \"Blue Ribbon\", \"Home Plate\", \"Home Makers\", and \"Junkin'\") were aired in two weekday blocks (from 8:00-11:00 a.m. and 3:00-5:00 p.m. ET). Much of the remaining programming was repurposed from various Fox Sports Networks properties, most notably Fox Sports South.\n\nOn October 13, 2006, the network was officially relaunched as a second iteration of SportSouth, and was eventually renamed Fox Sports Southeast in October 2015. It now operates in tandem with Fox Sports South.\n"}

The game revolves around a pair of ninja sent to assassinate a dictator in a futuristic version of New York City. A port was planned for the Game Boy, but was released in a rebranded form as \"Ninja Gaiden Shadow\".\n\nIn 2029, the evil Emperor Garuda has taken over the United States of America, building a stronghold in the middle of the nation's \"largest city\". To stop Garuda and avenge the innocent lives that were lost in his reign, two ninja masters from the Iga clan, Lord Hayate and Lady Kaede, are sent to infiltrate the dictator's well-guarded stronghold and kill him.\n\n\"Shadow of the Ninja\" is a side-scrolling platform game that can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with one player controlling Hayate (a ninja in purple) and the other as Kaede (a kunoichi in orange). In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character.\n\nThe player can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summoning a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality.\n\nThe player's default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally, but can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthened by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon's strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret power-ups hidden in some levels. The player can also obtain throwable shuriken and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long as the player's supply lasts before the player reverts to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions.\n\n\"Shadow of the Ninja\" consists of five levels with 16 stages, with the first four levels being divided into three stages and the final level into two. The player fights numerous types of enemy characters throughout each level, including bosses and sub-bosses. Once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are to it, since actually the same amount of health from one level will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared.\n\nAmerican magazine \"GamePro\" ran a contest in 1991, awarding 10 readers with a free copy of the game; the magazine stated the 10 giveaway copies were an exclusive edition, which had a password feature not included in any of the retail versions. \"Shadow of the Ninja\" was re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in 2010 and for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in 2015.\n\nNatsume began development of a Game Boy version following the NES release. However, the publishing rights of the game were picked up by Tecmo and the title was subsequently revised as a \"Ninja Gaiden\" 1991 spin-off \"Ninja Gaiden Shadow\", which was also developed by the Nagoya division of Natsume.\n\n\"Shadow of the Ninja\" was well received upon its release. The \"Greatest Hits\" special issue \"GamePro\" gave it a near-perfect score of 23/25 and called it \"an above average ninja fare with top of the line graphics and fast-paced gameplay\" and \"a top flight, fast-paced action cart,\" while \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" in particular praised the game's \"superb\" graphics and sound. \"Total!\" gave it a more reserved total rating of 74%, but added that \"if this is the kind of game you're into, you won't find a better cartridge for your NES this side of \"\".\" \"Nintendo Power\" featured it in the 1991 article \"Weird Heroes\" for supposedly featuring the \"first male-and-female team\" in video game history.\n\nRetrospectively, Hardcore Gaming 101's Kurt Kalata in 2006 called it \"still an excellent game.\" Matt Allen from Nintendo Life and Jeremy Parish from USgamer were more critical in their reviews of the Virtual Console release, awarding it six stars out of ten and three stars out five, respectively. Lucas M. Thomas from IGN rated the VC release 7.0/10, opining it is \"not quite as smooth or memorable as \"Gaiden\", and it'll frustrate you a few times as only an NES action game could -- but its unique qualities, like two-player co-op support, compensate well for any of its shortcomings.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2196489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196489", "title": "Minoru Saitō", "text": "Minoru Saitō\n\nMinoru Saitō is a Japanese solo yachtsman and one of the most notable veteran ocean sailboat racers in the world. He became the oldest person at age to do a solo circumnavigation of the globe. He has successfully made eight solo circumnavigations. \n\nOn October 16, 2004 Saitō left Japan on his yacht \"Shuten-dohji II\" (named after Shuten-dōji, a mythical demon who lived in the 10th century; it is also literally translated in English as \"Drunkard's Child,\" and sometimes jokingly westernized by other sailors as \"Shoot Your Doggy\") and returned 233 days later to complete his 7th circumnavigation, non-stop. He finished his 8th solo circumnavigation, this time the \"wrong way around,\" on September 17, 2011, after 1,080 days. He was 71 years old on completion. \n\nSaitō was born in Asakusa, Tokyo.\n\nHe has participated three times in the most prestigious and grueling race in the sailing world, the single-handed, around-the-globe competition originally called the BOC Challenge, then Around Alone, and renamed the Velux 5 Oceans Race which commenced in 2006. The races are run in legs, with stop-overs for rest and repair in several countries along the way. \n\nIn his continuing career, Saitō has become the most experienced blue-water yachtsman from Japan with transoceanic voyages totaling more than — almost exactly the distance to the moon. He has started and finished eight solo circumnavigations of the Earth, the seventh one non-stop, achieving several international honors and world records.\n\nSaitō is quite well known among American, European and Australian sailing enthusiasts, and increasingly so in Japan as his international renown becomes better appreciated in his home country.\n\nIn January, 2007, Saitō was named the recipient of the highly vaunted 2006 Blue Water Medal awarded to one outstanding sailor each year by the Cruising Club of America. This recognition is considered the top international award for adventure sailing.\n\nHe was also inducted in 2006 into the Single-handed Sailing Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, joining such solo sailing luminaries as Joshua Slocum (1844-1909); Sir Robin Knox-Johnston (1939-); Mike Plant (1950-1992); and Isabelle Autissier (1956-).\n\nIn January 2012, Saitō was named recipient of the Juan Sebastian del Cano Award, given by the 45,000-member United States Power Squadrons. The award is named for the navigator who finished the first-ever circumnavigation of the world led by Ferdinand Magellan in 1522. Saitō was cited for successfully completing his 8th solo circumnavigation at age 77, an international record, as well as for his nearly 40-year sailing career that includes a non-stop solo circumnavigation in 2005 at age 71. It was only the second time the award to honor adventure boating has been presented by the organization.\n\nSailing west-to-east to circle the globe in a wind-driven craft is no small feat but rarely is the plan to go \"westwardly\" instead — the \"wrong way around\" — against the prevailing winds, currents and waves. This route puts immense stresses on the vessel and crew, and for solo sailors, days can pass with little or no sleep when the going is particularly hard. \n\nFew single-handers have attempted such a feat and certainly none near Saitō's age — when he finished this voyage he was 77 years and 8 months old. \n\nThe voyage started with an October 2008 departure from Yokohama, and entailed a westward circumnavigation of , and expected arrival back in Yokohama in the spring of 2010, after 6 months. Instead, it took almost 3 years for him to successfully complete the circumnavigation.\n\nSaitō's vessel encountered a number of problems. He stopped for repair in Sydney, Australia in November 2008, in Fremantle, Australia in December and in Cape Town, S.Africa in February. He was disabled with rudder problems at Cape Horn, Chile in April, 2009. He was towed to the world's southernmost city, Punta Arenas, Chile, where he over-wintered and carried out repairs. A second attempt around the Horn was successful, but sail and engine problems forced him to return to Punta Arenas, where he again attended to repairs. He restarted the circumnavigation in late January, 2010. He still had engine problems and stopped at Valdivia, Chile in February-March 2010 for repair. He then made a long stop in Honolulu, USA (June 2010-May 2011) and shorter stops in Galapagos, Ecuador and Ogasawara, Japan.\n\nHe finished in Yokohama on September 17 2011, 1,080 days after his departure.\n\nSaitō's single-handed westward circumnavigation set two of the most-unchallengeable records of all sports: a solo circumnavigation at age 77 years and 8 months, and his 8th time around the globe solo in a sailing yacht.\n\n"}

Fifty percent of the deployed SM-73 missiles would be launched within the first hour after an alert and the remaining missiles would be launched one hour later. The requirement called for 85 percent of the decoy missiles to arrive at the target area within 115 nm (185 km). The SM-73 was to fly 4,000 nm (7,408 km) at speed of at least 0.85 Mach at an operating altitude of 50,000 ft (15,240 m) with a payload of 500 lb (227 kg). After flying 2,500 nm (4,650 km), the SM-73' would simulate the performance of the B-47 Stratojet or B-52 Stratofortress over the final 1,500 nm (2,780 km) of flight.\n\nStudy contracts were awarded to Convair and Fairchild in July 1954 by the United States Air Force under the project designation MX-2223.\n\nThe Fairchild MX-2223 design called for a non-metallic fuselage with swept wings and a v-tail. Radar reflectors were located in the fuselage and on pods positioned on the wing tips to simulate the radar return of a bomber.\n\nIn December 1955, Fairchild was awarded a contract to develop Weapon System 123A which included the SM-73 missile. American Machine and Foundry Company was responsible for the ground equipment, Ramo-Woodridge Corporation was responsible for electronic equipment, and Paul Omohundro Co who was responsible for airframe elements.\n\nTwo engine contracts were awarded by the USAF in November 1954 to minimize development risk.\n\nEach engine was in the 2,450 lbf (10.9 kN) thrust class with a thrust to weight ratio goal of 10:1. General Electric was awarded a contract for the development of the General Electric J85 and Fairchild was awarded a contract for the a competing engine the Fairchild J83. Fairchild proposed a lightweight engine of conventional design.\n\nThe proposed General Electric engine had a more advanced design, involving more risk, but having a higher thrust to weight ratio. The XSM-73 was powered by the Fairchild J83 on all test flights but was also capable of using the General Electric J85. The Fairchild J83 was operating by early 1957.\n\nLike the MX-2223 design, the SM-73 utilized a non-metallic fiberglass fuselage. The swept wing of the MX-2223 design evolved to a fiberglass 52°delta wing. A Thiokol solid-propellant rocket booster was used to launch the SM-73 to a speed of 300 knots (345 mph).\n\nCruise speed for the SM-73 was 488 knots (562 mph). The SM-73 had a fuel capacity of 803 gal (3,040 L) of JP-4. This fuel was stored in 10 fuselage and six wing tanks.\n\nAn autopilot used a Rate integrating gyroscope for directional control. The rate integrating gyroscope could be pre-programmed to turn the SM-73. Pitch and roll control were provided by elevons either operating in phase or asymmetrically. Yaw control was provided by a rudder. The control system positioned flight controls by sending electrical signals to hydraulic actuators located at each flight control.\n\nThe SM-73 was designed to carry radar reflectors and active electronic countermeasures operating in S-band, L-band, and lower frequencies. The SM-73 was not armed.\n\nFunding issues and problems with the fiberglass wing, the booster rocket, and the Fairchild J83 engine delayed testing.\n\nTest and evaluation began in February 1957 with rocket sled tests at Holloman Air Force Base. A B-57 Canberra was modified and used as a flying engine testbed for the Fairchild J83. Testing of the SM-73 then transitioned to Patrick Air Force Base in June 1957. At Patrick Air Force Base, launch complexes 21 and 22 were constructed near the Cape Canaveral Light to support SM-73 testing. Five dummy booster launches and fifteen test flights were flown between March 1957 and December 1958.\n\nThe United States Air Force planned to purchase 2,328 operational missiles and 53 missiles for test and evaluation. This would have provided enough missiles for 10 squadrons. Deployment was planned to start in 1961 and be completed by October 1963. Bull Goose bases were initially planned at Duluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota and Ethan Allen Air Force Base, Vermont. Construction of Bull Goose missile sites began in August 1958.\n\nIn December 1958 the program was canceled because the missile was not able to simulate a B-52 on radar. The Fairchild J83 engine program was also canceled in November 1958. Total program cost at cancellation was $136.5 million USD.\n\nThe SD-5 Osprey reconnaissance drone was developed with the Goose as a basis.\n\n\n\n"}

The song was first released on AC/DC's eighth studio album \"For Those About to Rock We Salute You\" in 1981, and later as a single in 1982. The single's B-side contains an edited live version of \"Let There Be Rock\", recorded in Landover, Maryland, in late 1981. The video to \"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" was filmed at that same concert.\n\nThe song was later included on AC/DC's first soundtrack album, \"Who Made Who\", released in 1986 for the Stephen King film \"Maximum Overdrive\".\n\nThe title and central lyric of the song are based on an ancient salute used by Roman prisoners to be executed in the Colosseum, \"\"Ave, Caesar, morituri te salutant\"\" (\"Hail Caesar, those who are about to die salute you\"). However, Angus Young later said that the inspiration for the cannons came from a very different source. The band was cutting the first recordings of the song on the same day as Princess Diana of Great Britain's televised wedding. Angus recalled that \"someone had the wedding on in the next room ... we were playing that part of the song when the cannons were going off and we paused a second and went 'hmmm ... that actually sounds pretty good.'\" This coincidence also led to a cannon being featured on the cover of the album and single, as well as life-sized Napoleonic cannons becoming a regular stage prop at AC/DC concerts. The cannons fired in the song are mixed with exploding fireworks. However the actual takes were recorded later the next month as the mobile truck used to record the album (Mobile One) was being used to record Peter Gabriel's 4th eponymous album during the marriage of Charles and Diana.\n\nAC/DC have often used the song to close live concerts, such as \"Live at Donington\" and \"No Bull\" as well as on their live CD \"AC/DC Live\". It is also the song that concludes the most recent tour, Rock or Bust.\n\n"}

He was born in Syrrako, Epirus and played a leading role in the political life of the Greek state in the 1830s and 1840s. Kolettis studied medicine in Pisa, Italy and was influenced by the Carbonari movement and started planning his return to Epirus in order to participate in Greece's independence struggles.\n\nIn 1813, he settled at Ioannina, where he served as a doctor and after gaining standing he was recruited as the personal doctor of Ali Pasa's son, Muqtar Pasa. He remained in Ioannina till March 1821, when he entered Filiki Eteria and left for Syrrako, together with chieftain Raggos, in order to spread the revolution into Central Greece (Rumeli), but his efforts quickly failed because of the rapid reaction of the Ottoman army. Kolettis was the leader of the pro-French party and based his power on his relations with the leaders of Central Greece but also on his ability to eliminate his adversaries by acting behind the scenes.\n\nIn the First Greek National Assembly, at Epidavros, he participated as the representative of Epirus and in January, 1822 he became Minister of Internal Affairs. After the Second Greek National Assembly, at Astros in May, 1823 he was appointed sub-prefect of Euboea and managed to remove Turkish troops off the island. At the same time, he continued his political activities, resulting in his election as member of the Legislative Body (Νομοθετικόν), a position that he held till 1826.\n\nAt the end of 1824, during the civil war between the rebel factions, he was in charge of the Roumeliot (Central Greece) party and defeated the Moreot or Peloponnesian party, which opposed the Kountouriotis government. Nonetheless, in the Third Greek National Assembly, he supported the Peloponnesian party and with its support was assigned to train troops from Thessaly and Macedonia, with the aim of destroying Ottoman resource depots at Atalanti. However, the whole operation failed because of his inexperience in military affairs, which ruined his reputation.\n\nWhen John Capodistria landed at Nafplio in January 1828 as governor, he was appointed as governor of Samos and later, in July 1829 as Minister of Defense. In October 1831, Capodistria was assassinated; in the ensuing civil war, which lasted until 1832, Kolettis was once again leader of the Roumeliot Party. He tried, along with Theodoros Kolokotronis and Augustinos Kapodistrias to form a government but due to severe disagreements the coalition was dissolved. To assume leadership after 1821, he is considered responsible for the death of a great Greek Independence Hero, Odysseus Androutsos, and also responsible for the separation (\"divide and conquer\") of a legendary couple of the Greek Independence: Prince Dimitrius Ypsilantis and Manto Mavrogenous.\n\nUntil Otto of Greece reached adulthood, Kolettis was Minister of the Navy and Minister of Defense. In 1835, he was sent to France as the ambassador where he created connections with French politicians and intellectuals. He returned to Greece after the coup that broke out in Athens in September 1843, which forced King Otto to grant a constitution and Kolettis took part in the subsequent Constitutional Assembly. To contest the elections in 1844, he formed a party, the \"French Party\" (Γαλλικό Κόμμα) and together with Andreas Metaxas, leader of the \"Russian Party\" formed a government. When Metaxas resigned, he became Prime Minister and served as such until his death in 1847. He is credited with conceiving the Megali Idea or \"Great Idea\" which became the core of Greek foreign policy until the early 20th century.\n"}

It is based on a John Collier short story published in the 1951 collection \"Fancies and Goodnights\".\n\nWritten originally for television, the musical focuses on a poet who takes refuge from the world by hiding out in a department store after closing. He meets a community of night people who live in the store and falls in love with a beautiful young girl named Ella. Bizarre complications arise when the leader of the group forbids their relationship.\n\nPoet Charles Snell takes refuge from the world by hiding out in a department store after closing (\"If You Can Find Me, I'm Here\"). Once there he finds a secret group who have lived in the store for years. The leader of the group, Mrs. Monday, permits Charles to stay after he convinces her that he is a poet.\n\nCharles meets and is smitten with a beautiful young girl, Ella Harkins, Mrs. Monday's maid. Ella, who is now 19, has lived in the store since she was separated from her mother at age six, falling asleep in the women's hat department. Ella is unhappy and wants to leave, but is afraid of the \"Dark Men.\" Should someone try to return to the outside world and risk revealing the group's existence, the Dark Men take them away and another mannequin appears in the clothing department.\n\nCharles realizes Ella has not seen the sun for thirteen years, but she replies that she remembers (\"I Remember\"). Charles has fallen in love with Ella; as he plays cards with members of the group, he has a quiet duet with Ella (\"When\"). Ella finally decides to leave with Charles (\"Take Me To The World\"). Charles is initially reluctant to leave his now-comfortable life, but then understands that he loves Ella more than poetry. Mrs. Monday and the others hear their plans, and they call the Dark Men, as Ella and Charles try to escape.\n\nThe store opens the next morning with a couple on the sidewalk who resemble Ella and Charles from behind, but turn out to be strangers when the camera pans to their faces. They're looking at a window display in which Ella and Charles are now mannequins dressed as a bride and groom, with the night watchman acting as their minister.\n\nWritten specifically for the television anthology series \"ABC Stage 67\", it aired on November 16, 1966.

Because of her beauty, she was pursued by many men, but rejected their advances. Finally, she met and married Malik ibn Nuwayra.\n\nMalik was a chief of some distinction; a warrior, noted for his generosity; and a famous poet. Bravery, generosity and poetry were the three qualities most admired among the Arabs. During the lifetime of Muhammad, he had been appointed as a tax collector.\n\nDuring the Ridda wars, which broke out in Arabia after the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr sent his most talented general Khalid ibn Walid into Najd with 4000 men to submit the tribes of the surrounding areas. Malik was guilty for his acts against the state of Medina. After the death of Muhammad, he broke in open revolt against Medina. As soon as Malik heard of the death of Muhammad, he gave back all the tax to his tribesmen, saying that \n\"\"I will only pay taxes to the man chosen at Ghadeer\" (Ali ibn Abu Taleb)\".\nMoreover, he was to be charged because he signed a pact with the self-proclaimed prophetess Sajjah. This agreement stated that first they would deal with local enemy tribes together, and then they would confront the state of Medina.\nWhen Malik heard about Khalid ibn Walid's victories against powerful Arab tribes, he ordered his tribesmen not to engage the approaching Khalid ibn Walid in battle, to stay at home and hope for peace. He himself apparently moved away across the desert with his family. Also, so as to prove himself loyal to the state of Medina (the future Islamic empire), he collected the tax and sent it to Medina. \nHis riders were stopped by Khalid ibn Walid's army at the town of Battah. Khalid asked them about the signing of a pact with Sajjah but they said it was only to exact revenge on their terrible enemies. \nWhen Khalid reached Najd, he found no opposing army, so he sent his cavalry to nearby villages and ordered them to call the Azaan (call for prayer) to each party they meet. Zirrar bin Azwar, a group leader, arrested the family of Malik claiming they did not answer the call to prayer.\n\nMalik was asked by Khalid about his crimes. Malik's response was \"your master said this, your master said that\" referring to Abu Bakr. Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution. Khalid bin Walid killed Malik ibn Nuwayra and forcefully married his wife, Layla bint al-Minhal. Although Sunnis claim that Khalid married his wife on the same night, the Shias argue that Islamically, Khalid would have had to wait for her to complete the waiting period or iddah of a widow which is four months and ten days before he would have been able to marry her hence the forced marriage was void. \nAbu Qatada al-Ansari was a companion of Muhammad who accompanied Khalid from Medina. He was so shocked at Malik's murder by Khalid that he immediately returned to Medina and told Abu Bakr that he would not serve under a commander who had killed a Muslim. \nThe death of Malik and Khalid's taking of his wife Layla created a controversy. Some officers of his army—including a prominent companion of Muhammad, Abu Qatadah—believed that Khalid killed Malik to take his wife. After the pressure exerted by Umar—Khalid's cousin and one of Caliph Abu Bakr's main advisors—Abu Bakr called Khalid back to Medina to explain himself.\nUmar demanded from Abu Bakr the immediate dismissal of Khalid. He said that Khalid had to be put on trial for the twin crimes of murder and adultery. According to Islamic law, Khalid had to be stoned to death, but Abu Bakr defended Khalid and said that he had simply made \"an error of judgment.\" \n\nWhen arrested in November 632 AD, Malik was asked by Khalid ibn Walid about his crimes. Khalid's interpretation of Malik's response was that although he and his followers were Muslims, they did not wish to pay taxes to Abu Bakr. Khalid understood this to be a transparent attempt by Malik to save his own life by any means at his disposal. Khalid having clear evidence of Malik's distributing the tax money on getting news of Muhammad's death declared Malik an apostate and ordered his execution. Due to the controversy of marrying Malik’s wife on the same night, who was not allowed a waiting or mourning period, Khalid has to explain himself in the court of Medina. In Medina, ‘Umar told Khâlid: “You enemy of Allâh! You killed a Muslim man and thereafter took his wife. By Allâh, I will stone you.'. However Abu Bakr forgave him for his action.\n\n"}

{"id": "2196573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196573", "title": "Robert Bauval", "text": "Robert Bauval\n\nRobert Bauval (born in Alexandria, Egypt) is a Belgian author and lecturer, perhaps best known for the fringe Orion Correlation Theory regarding the Giza pyramid complex.\n\nBauval was born in Alexandria, Egypt, to parents of Belgian and Maltese origins. He attended the British Boys' School in Alexandria (now El Nasr Boys' School) and the Franciscan College in Buckinghamshire, England. He left Egypt in 1967 just before the Six-Day War, during the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser. He has spent most of his engineering career living and working in the Middle East and Africa as a construction engineer.\n\nIn late 1992, Bauval had been trying to obtain a translation of \"Hermetica\" by Walter Scott. He then came across a new edition printed by Solo Press with a foreword by Adrian Gilbert. Bauval contacted Gilbert after being interested in his foreword concerning a link between an Alexandrine school of Hermes Trismegistus and the pyramid builders of the Fourth dynasty of Egypt. They went on to write \"The Orion Mystery\" together, which became an international bestseller. BBC Two broadcast a documentary on Bauval's ideas around the time of the book's publication. He has co-authored three books with Graham Hancock, including 2004's \"Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith\" in which the two put forward what sociologist of religion David V. Barrettin a review in \"The Independent\" described \"Talisman\" as a factually incorrect and unconvincing \"mess of a book\" based upon indiscriminate use of source material culminating by \"promulgating a version of the old Jewish-Masonic plot so beloved by ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists.\n\nBauval is specifically known for the Orion Correlation Theory (OCT), which proposes a relationship between the fourth dynasty Egyptian pyramids of the Giza Plateau and the alignment of certain stars in the constellation of Orion. However, 20 years before Bauval's book \"The Orion Mystery\" suggested that the Giza Pyramids were aligned to Orion's belt, Dr. James J. Hurtak pointed out such a correlation in 1973.\n\nOne night in 1983, while working in Saudi Arabia, he took his family and a friend's family up into the sand dunes of the Arabian desert for a camping expedition. His friend pointed out the constellation of Orion, and mentioned that Alnitak, the most easterly of the stars making up Orion's belt, was offset slightly from the others. Bauval then made a connection between the layout of the three main stars in Orion's belt and the layout of the three main pyramids in the Giza necropolis.\n\nThe Orion Correlation Theory has been described as a form of pseudoarchaeology. Among the idea's critics have been two astronomers: Ed Krupp of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and Anthony Fairall, astronomy professor at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Krupp and Fairall independently investigated the angle between the alignment of Orion's Belt to North during the era cited by Bauval (which differs from the angle in the 3rd millennium BCE, because of the precession of the equinoxes), and found that the angle was somewhat different from the 'perfect match' claimed by Bauval and Hancock: 47 to 50 degrees, compared to the 38-degree angle formed by the pyramids.\n\nKrupp also pointed out that the slightly-bent line formed by the three pyramids was deviated towards the North, whereas the slight \"kink\" in the line of Orion's Belt was deformed to the South, meaning that a direct correlation would require one or the other to be inverted. Indeed, this is what was done in the original book by Bauval and Gilbert (\"The Orion Mystery\"), which compared images of the pyramids and Orion without revealing that the pyramids' map had been inverted. Krupp and Fairall find other problems with the claims, including the point that if the Sphinx is meant to represent the constellation of Leo, then it should be on the opposite side of the Nile (the 'Milky Way') from the pyramids ('Orion'), that the vernal equinox around 10,500 BCE was in Virgo and not Leo, and that the constellations of the Zodiac originate from Mesopotamia and were unknown in Egypt at the time.\n\nOn 4 November 1999, the BBC broadcast a documentary entitled \"Atlantis Reborn\" which tested the ideas of Robert Bauval and his colleague, Graham Hancock. Bauval and Hancock afterwards complained to the BSC (Broadcasting Standards Commission) that they had been treated unfairly. A hearing followed and in November 2000 the BSC ruled in favour of the documentary makers on all but one of the ten principal complaints brought by Hancock and Bauval.\n\nThe BSC concluded that Hancock and Bauval had been treated unfairly in respect of an omission of their rebuttal of a specific argument against the Orion Correlation Theory. In regard of the nine remaining principal complaints, the BSC ruled against Hancock and Bauval, concluding that they had not been treated unfairly in the criticism of their theories concerning carbon-dating, the Great Sphinx of Egypt, Cambodia's Angkor temples, Japan's Yonaguni formation and the mythical land of Atlantis.\n\nThe BBC offered to broadcast a revised version of the documentary, which was welcomed by Hancock and Bauval. It was broadcast as \"Atlantis Reborn Again\" on 14 December 2000. The revised documentary continued to present serious doubts about Bauval and Hancock's ideas, as held by astronomer Anthony Fairall, Ed Krupp of the Griffith Observatory, Egyptologist Kate Spence of Cambridge University and Eleanor Mannikka of the University of Michigan.\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"Hainanese\" was frequently used by all inhabitants of Hainan island to refer to themselves overseas. Min speaking Hainanese often refer to themselves as Qiongwen to distinguish themselves from other ethnic groups of Hainan such as the Cantonese or Tanka.\n\nMost Hainanese Han people were originally fishers from the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi who later settled in the island of Hainan, while the Lingaoese, Tanka and Li natives invaded the island earlier and were descendants of the Yue tribe, from mainland China.\n\nDuring the fall of the Song Dynasty, Min Hainanese-speaking colonists of scholars and military families arrived and colonized the island from the three districts of Xinghua prefecture (including Putian city) in the centre-coast of Fujian province pushing many if not most of the local inhabitants to the impoverished areas. As a result of the assimilation of other dialect groups, many Hainanese genetically cluster with Han Chinese from Guangdong and Guangxi instead of Fujianese people.\n\nSimilarly to Fujian and Guangdong provinces, Hainan has been a source for immigrants. Towards the turn of the 20th century, many Hainanese migrated to various Southeast Asian nations, where they worked as cooks, restaurateurs, coffee shop owners, clothesmakers, sailors and hoteliers. Chan Sing, one of the \"villain\" movie stars that dotted the Hong Kong movie industry was of Hainanese ancestry, as was the bartender who invented the world-famous Singapore Sling at the renowned Singapore Raffles Hotel, Mr. Ngiam Tong Boon. In Thailand, singer Nichkhun of 2PM, media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul, the politically influential Sarasin family, as well as two of the wealthiest business families, the Chirathivats and the Yoovidhyas, all trace their ancestries to Hainan. In Laos, former deputy prime minister Somsavat Lengsavad is also of Hainanese descent.\n\nIn Hainan, the local Han Chinese speak Hainanese, a Min Chinese language also known as \"Qiongwen\", as their native tongue. The dialect of Wenchang () is spoken by Hainanese from the northern parts of Hainan. Numerous Wenchang Hainanese descended from Jinshi and merchants from Putian as many of their Jiapu show. This is also why they pronounce some words with the Hokkien twang (example: close door is \"gieh mui\" for other Hainanese dialects. Today, many Wenchang Hainanese still return to Putian for ancestors tomb cleaning (). Many Hainanese who have surnames largely found only in Cantonese people like 麦, 邝, 莫, 谭, 岑, 庞, 梅, etc. have ancestry from Cantonese immigrants who immigrated to the island in waves especially during the Ming dynasty as indicated in historical records and their jiapus. Standard Chinese (phonologically based on Beijing Mandarin) is also the lingua franca in the island province as in the rest of China.\n\nThe Hainanese are known for their signature dishes such as the Hainanese chicken rice, Wenchang chicken, Hainanese pork chop, Hainanese mutton soup, Hainanese salted fish soup and beef noodle soup.\n\nNotably, in Singapore, these signature dishes are served at the various eateries located along Purvis Street, within the Hainanese enclave; as a result, Purvis Street is often referred to as \"Hainan Second Street\", while Middle Road and Seah Street are referred to as \"Hainan First Street\" and \"Hainan Third Street\" respectively. Hainanese chicken rice is a recognised dish throughout Southeast Asia due to the Hainanese diaspora in these areas who famed it. It is often labelled as Singapore's national dish.\n\nHainanese opera (Qiong opera) is a passion for many Hainanese, particularly for the older generation. Enriched with local flavours, Hainanese opera is part and parcel of Hainanese culture.\n\n"}

In China, the typical morphotype of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" is ribbed-shelled, and its distribution is restricted to Yangtze River basin. Smooth-shelled snails are also distributed in mainland China, but are considered as the same species and subspecies of \"Oncomelania hupensis\".\n\n\"Oncomelania hupensis\" reported in other Far East countries are smooth-shelled, and have been considered either as subspecies of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" or independent species in this genus.\n\n\nThere are 4 subspecies of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" in China: \"hupensis\", \"robertsoni\", \"tangi\" and \"guangxiensis\".\n\nGenetic confirmation of thsese four Chinese subspecies: Based on shell form, biogeographical and allozyme data, Davis et al. (1995) distinguished 3 subspecies of the \"Oncomelania hupensis\" in mainland China. However, Zhou et al. (2008) separated the \"Oncomelania hupensis guangxiensis\" out from \"Oncomelania hupensis tangi\" based on allozymes and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), which was verified recently by Li et al. with internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S fragments.\n\nIt may also be possible that continuous control efforts, such as routine molluscicides in China, which have been used to control snails for about fifty years, might have imposed some effect on population genetics of these snails.\n\nThe complete mitochondrial genome of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" has been released in 2010.\n\nIt is seasonally amphibious species which lives in lakes and on marshy ground.\n\nThe habitats of \"Oncomelania hupensis\" in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River include lake/marshland regions and hill regions, both of which have extensive physical connections with the Yangtze River through channels or in low floodplains beside the Yangtze River. With frequent floodings of the Yangtze River, snails in these habitats can be dispersed and subsequently deposited widely in various localities. The accumulation of mixed sources of snails can then generate genetically diversified populations of snails, leading to the existence of various haplotypes.\n\nIn Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, \"Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni\" are distributed in mountainous areas, and are not subjected to flood influence as much as in the middle and lower reaches of the river. It is interesting to see that a relatively lower number of haplotypes were found in this region as compared with \"Oncomelania hupensis hupensis\". It appears likely that there has been certain degree of isolation for these mountainous populations.\n\nThis freshwater snail is significant medically, because it is an important vector of parasitic infection in the tropics and subtropics. It can serve as vectors for two serious human diseases: the schistosomiasis blood fluke parasite, and the paragonimus lung fluke parasites.\n\n\"Oncomelania hupensis\" is the unique intermediate host of \"Schistosoma japonicum\", which causes schistosomiasis endemic in the Far East, and especially in mainland China. \"Oncomelania hupensis\" largely determines the parasite's geographical range.

{"id": "2196633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196633", "title": "Stereocilia (inner ear)", "text": "Stereocilia (inner ear)\n\nIn the inner ear, stereocilia are the mechanosensing organelles of hair cells, which respond to fluid motion in numerous types of animals for various functions, including hearing and balance. They are about 10–50 micrometers in length and share some similar features of microvilli. The hair cells turn the fluid pressure and other mechanical stimuli into electric stimuli via the many microvilli that make up stereocilia rods. Stereocilia exist in the auditory and vestibular systems.\n\nResembling hair-like projections, the stereocilia are arranged in bundles of 30-300. Within the bundles the stereocilia are often lined up in several rows of increasing height, similar to a staircase. At the core of these hair-like stereocilia are rigid cross-linked actin filaments, which can renew every 48 hours. These actin filaments face their positive ends at the tips of the stereocilia and their negative ends at the base and can be up to 120 micrometres in length. Filamentous structures, called tip links, connect the tips of stereocilia in adjacent rows in the bundles. The tip links are made up of nearly vertical fine filaments that run upward from the top end of a shorter stereocilia to its taller neighbor. Tip links are analogous to tiny springs, which, when stretched, open cation selective channels thus allowing ions to flow across the cell membrane into the hair cells. They also are involved in the force transmission across the bundle and the maintenance of the hair bundle structure.\n\nAs acoustic sensors in mammals, stereocilia are lined up in the organ of Corti within the cochlea of the inner ear. In hearing, stereocilia transform the mechanical energy of sound waves into electrical signals for the hair cells, which ultimately leads to an excitation of the auditory nerve. Stereocilia are composed of cytoplasm with embedded bundles of cross-linked actin filaments. The actin filaments anchor to the terminal web and the top of the cell membrane and are arranged in grade of height. As sound waves propagate in the cochlea, the movement of endolymph fluid bends the stereocilia. If the direction of movement is towards the taller stereocilia, tension develops in the tip links, mechanically opening transduction channels near the tips. Cations from the endolymph flow into the cell, depolarizing the hair cell and triggering the release of neurotransmitters to nearby nerves, which send an electrical signal to the central nervous system.\n\nIn the vestibular system, the stereocilia are located in the otolithic organs and the semicircular canals. Hair cells in the vestibular system are slightly different from those in the auditory system, in that vestibular hair cells have one tallest cilium, termed the kinocilium. Bending the stereocilia toward the kinocilium depolarizes the cell and results in increased afferent activity. Bending the stereocilia away from the kinocilium hyperpolarizes the cell and results in a decrease in afferent activity. In the semicircular canals, the hair cells are found in the crista ampullaris, and the stereocilia protrude into the ampullary cupula. Here, the stereocilia are all oriented in the same direction. In the otoliths, the hair cells are topped by small, calcium carbonate crystals called otoconia. Unlike the semicircular ducts, the kinocilia of hair cells in the otoliths are not oriented in a consistent direction. The kinocilia point toward (in the utricle) or away from (in the saccule) a middle line called the striola.\n\nIn the cochlea, a shearing movement between the tectorial membrane and the basilar membrane deflects the stereocilia, affecting the tension on the tip-link filaments, which then open and close the non-specific ion channels. When tension increases, the flow of ions across the membrane into the hair cell rises as well. Such influx of ions causes a depolarization of the cell, resulting in an electrical potential that ultimately leads to a signal for the auditory nerve and the brain. The identity of the mechanosensitive channels in the stereocilia is still unknown.\n\nThe transduction channels associated with stereocilia are thought to lie at the distal ends of the stereocilia. Deflections of the stereocilia in the direction of the tallest stereocilia leads to an increased rate of opening of nonspecific cation channels. This, in turn, causes receptor depolarization and leads to the excitement of the cochlear nerve afferents that are located at the base of the hair cell. Deflections of the stereocilia in the opposite direction toward the shortest stereocilia causes transduction channels to close. In this situation, the hair cells become hyperpolarized and the nerve afferents are not excited.\n\nThere are two different types of fluid that surround the hair cells of the inner ear. The endolymph is the fluid that surrounds the apical surfaces of hair cells. Potassium is the major cation in the endolymph and is thought to be responsible for carrying the receptor currents in the cochlea. Perilymph is found surrounding the sides and the bases of the hair cells. Perilymph is low in potassium and high in sodium. The different ionic makeups of the surrounding fluid in addition to the resting potential of the hair cell creates a potential difference across the apical membrane of the hair cell, so potassium enters when transduction channels open. An influx of potassium ions depolarizes the cell and causes the release of a neurotransmitter that can initiate nerve impulses in the sensory neurons that synapse on the base of the hair cell.\n\nStereocilia (along with the entirety of the hair cell) in mammals can be damaged or destroyed by excessive loud noises, disease, and toxins and are not regenerable. Environmental noise induced hearing impairment is probably the most prevalent noise health effect according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Abnormal structure/organization of a bundle of stereocilia can also cause deafness and in turn create balance problems for an individual. In other vertebrates, if the hair cell is harmed, supporting cells will divide and replace the damaged hair cells.\n\nThe methionine sulfoxide reductase B3 gene (MsrB3), a protein repair enzyme, has been implicated in large scale stereocilia bundle degeneration, as well as many other factors such as gestational age and tolerance to cold environments in plants. Although the exact process of pathogenesis is unknown, it seems to be related to apoptotic cell death. A study based on splicing morpholinos to down-regulate MsrB3 expression in zebrafish showed shorter, thinner, and more crowded cilia, as well as small, misplaced otoliths. Several stereocilia also underwent apoptosis. Injection with wild-type MsrB3 mRNA rescued auditory deficits, suggesting MsrB3 helps prevent apoptosis.\n\nAnother gene, DFNB74, has been observed as a gene involved in recessive hearing loss. DFNB74 based hearing loss may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. DFNB74 and MsrB3 based deafness may be related to one another. Research on these genes is based on families with recessive deafness, and multiple nonrelated families with this deafness have mutations on both DFNB74 and MsrB3.\n\nDamaged or abnormal stereocilia that are a result of genetic mutations often cause hearing loss and other complications, and can be passed down to children. In a recent study, researchers studied mice that inherited a mutated hair cell gene called whirlin, which leads to shorter and fatter stereocilia that are organized in additional rows and that often die off after birth. No current therapies or reparative measures exist to replace such defective hair cells in humans. In order to correct this mutation, researchers injected a gene therapy containing the corrected gene into the inner ear of mice with the genetic mutation. The therapy restored stereocilia to normal lengths and eliminated the additional rows of stereocilia in newborn whirler mice. Despite the restoration of hair cells, the treated whirler mice exhibited no signs of improved hearing ability following testing after one month and after three months of treatment. Further studies are looking to understand why the restoration of the stereocilia did not improve the hearing ability of the mutated mice.\n\nSound above a certain decibel level can cause permanent damage to inner ear stereocilia. New research has shown that the damage can possibly be reversed if we can repair or recreate some of the proteins in the stereocilia. In this study, scientists used zebrafish to examine the motion of proteins within live ear cells using a confocal microscope. This has shown that proteins in stereocilia move quickly, indicating that the movement of the proteins within the hair cells may be a very important factor to maintaining the integrity of the hair bundles in the inner ear. Further research found myosin and actin, two proteins that are important for cell movement, move very quickly. Fascin 2b, a protein involved in actin cross-linking, moves even faster. Constant movement of proteins within cells, along with replacement and readjustment, helps cells repair damage. The fast movement of these proteins has changed our understanding of stereocilia and indicates that proteins within stereocilia are not immobile and static. Further research hopes to investigate manipulating protein dynamics to restore human hearing function after damage.\n"}

{"id": "2196648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196648", "title": "Lithium hydride", "text": "Lithium hydride\n\nLithium hydride is an inorganic compound with the formula LiH. This alkali metal hydride is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are grey. Characteristic of a salt-like (ionic) hydride, it has a high melting point, and it is not soluble but reactive with all organic and protic solvents. It is soluble and nonreactive with certain molten salts such as lithium fluoride, lithium borohydride, and sodium hydride. With a molecular mass of slightly less than 8.0, it is the lightest ionic compound.\n\nLiH is a diamagnetic and an ionic conductor with a conductivity gradually increasing from at 443 °C to 0.18 Ωcm at 754 °C; there is no discontinuity in this increase through the melting point. The dielectric constant of LiH decreases from 13.0 (static, low frequencies) to 3.6 (visible-light frequencies). LiH is a soft material with a Mohs hardness of 3.5. Its compressive creep (per 100 hours) rapidly increases from < 1% at 350 °C to > 100% at 475 °C, meaning that LiH can't provide mechanical support when heated.\n\nThe thermal conductivity of LiH decreases with temperature and depends on morphology: the corresponding values are 0.125 W/(cm·K) for crystals and 0.0695 W/(cm·K) for compacts at 50 °C, and 0.036 W/(cm·K) for crystals and 0.0432 W/(cm·K) for compacts at 500 °C. The linear thermal expansion coefficient is 4.2/°C at room temperature.\n\nLiH is produced by treating lithium metal with hydrogen gas:\n\nThis reaction is especially rapid at temperatures above 600 °C. Addition of 0.001–0.003% carbon, or/and increasing temperature or/and pressure, increases the yield up to 98% at 2-hour residence time. However, the reaction proceeds at temperatures as low as 29 °C. The yield is 60% at 99 °C and 85% at 125 °C, and the rate depends significantly on the surface condition of LiH.\n\nLess common ways of LiH synthesis include thermal decomposition of lithium aluminium hydride (200 °C), lithium borohydride (300 °C), n-butyllithium (150 °C), or ethyllithium (120 °C), as well as several reactions involving lithium compounds of low stability and available hydrogen content.\n\nChemical reactions yield LiH in the form of lumped powder, which can be compressed into pellets without a binder. More complex shapes can be produced by casting from the melt. Large single crystals (about 80 mm long and 16 mm in diameter) can be then grown from molten LiH powder in hydrogen atmosphere by the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique. They often have bluish color owing to the presence of colloidal Li. This color can be removed by post-growth annealing at lower temperatures (~550 °C) and lower thermal gradients. Major impurities in these crystals are Na (20–200 parts per million, ppm), O (10–100 ppm), Mg (0.5–6 ppm), Fe (0.5-2 ppm) and Cu (0.5-2 ppm).\nBulk cold-pressed LiH parts can be easily machined using standard techniques and tools to micrometer precision. However, cast LiH is brittle and easily cracks during processing.\n\nA more energy efficient route to form lithium hydride powder is by ball milling lithium metal under high hydrogen pressure. A problem with this method is the cold welding of lithium metal due to the high ductility. By adding small amounts of lithium hydride powder the cold welding can be avoided. \n\nLiH powder reacts rapidly with air of low humidity, forming LiOH, and . In moist air the powder ignites spontaneously, forming a mixture of products including some nitrogenous compounds. The lump material reacts with humid air, forming a superficial coating, which is a viscous fluid. This inhibits further reaction, although the appearance of a film of \"tarnish\" is quite evident. Little or no nitride is formed on exposure to humid air. The lump material, contained in a metal dish, may be heated in air to slightly below 200 °C without igniting, although it ignites readily when touched by an open flame. The surface condition of LiH, presence of oxides on the metal dish, etc., have a considerable effect on the ignition temperature. Dry oxygen does not react with crystalline LiH unless heated strongly, when an almost explosive combustion occurs.\n\nLiH is highly reactive toward water and other protic reagents:\n\nLiH is less reactive with water than Li and thus is a much less powerful reducing agent for water, alcohols, and other media containing reducible solutes. This is true for all the binary saline hydrides.\n\nLiH pellets slowly expand in moist air, forming LiOH; however, the expansion rate is below 10% within 24 hours in a pressure of 2 Torr of water vapor. If moist air contains carbon dioxide, then the product is lithium carbonate. LiH reacts with ammonia, slowly at room temperature, but the reaction accelerates significantly above 300 °C. LiH reacts slowly with higher alcohols and phenols, but vigorously with lower alcohols.\n\nLiH reacts with sulfur dioxide:\nthough above 50 °C the product is lithium dithionite.\n\nLiH reacts with acetylene to form lithium carbide and hydrogen. With anhydrous organic acids, phenols and acid anhydrides LiH reacts slowly, producing hydrogen gas and the lithium salt of the acid. With water-containing acids, LiH reacts faster than with water. Many reactions of LiH with oxygen-containing species yield LiOH, which in turn irreversibly reacts with LiH at temperatures above 300 °C:\n\nWith a hydrogen content in proportion to its mass three times that of NaH, LiH has the highest hydrogen content of any hydride. LiH is periodically of interest for hydrogen storage, but applications have been thwarted by its stability to decomposition. Thus removal of H requires temperatures above the 700 °C used for its synthesis, such temperatures are expensive to create and maintain. The compound was once tested as a fuel component in a model rocket.\n\nLiH is not usually a hydride-reducing agent, except in the synthesis of hydrides of certain metalloids. For example, silane is produced in the reaction of lithium hydride and silicon tetrachloride by the Sundermeyer process:\n\nLithium hydride is used in the production of a variety of reagents for organic synthesis, such as lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH) and lithium borohydride (LiBH). Triethylborane reacts to give superhydride (LiBHEt).\n\nLithium hydride (LiH) is sometimes a desirable material for the shielding of nuclear reactors, with the isotope lithium-7 (Li-7), and it can be fabricated by casting.\n\nLithium deuteride, in the form of lithium-7 deuteride, is a good moderator for nuclear reactors, because deuterium (H-2) has a lower neutron absorption cross-section than ordinary hydrogen (H-1) does, and the cross-section for Li-7 is also low, decreasing the absorption of neutrons in a reactor. Lithium-7 is preferred for a moderator because it has a lower neutron capture cross-section, and it also forms less tritium (H-3) under bombardment with neutrons.\n\nThe corresponding lithium-6 deuteride, Li</sup>H, or LiD, is the primary fusion fuel in thermonuclear weapons. In hydrogen warheads of the Teller–Ulam design, a nuclear fission trigger explodes to heat and compress the lithium-6 deuteride, and to bombard the LiD with neutrons to produce tritium in an exothermic reaction: Li + n → He + H. The deuterium and tritium (both isotopes of hydrogen) then fuse to produce helium-4, one neutron, and 17.59 MeV of free energy in the form of gamma rays, kinetic energy, etc. The helium is an inert byproduct.\n\nBefore the Castle Bravo nuclear weapons test in 1954, it was thought that only the less common isotope lithium-6 would breed tritium when struck with fast neutrons. The Castle Bravo test showed (accidentally) that the more plentiful lithium-7 also does so under extreme conditions, albeit by an endothermic reaction.\n\nLiH reacts violently with water to give hydrogen gas and LiOH, which is caustic. Consequently, LiH dust can explode in humid air, or even in dry air due to static electricity. At concentrations of in air the dust is extremely irritating to the mucous membranes and skin and may cause an allergic reaction. Because of the irritation, LiH is normally rejected rather than accumulated by the body.\n\nSome lithium salts, which can be produced in LiH reactions, are toxic. LiH fire should not be extinguished using carbon dioxide, carbon tetrachloride, or aqueous fire extinguishers; they should be smothered by covering with a metal object or graphite or dolomite powder. Sand is less suitable, as it can explode when mixed with burning LiH, especially if not dry. LiH is normally transported in oil, using containers made of ceramic, certain plastics or steel, and is handled in an atmosphere of dry argon or helium. Nitrogen can be used, but not at elevated temperatures, as it reacts with lithium. LiH normally contains some metallic lithium, which corrodes steel or silica containers at elevated temperatures.\n\n"}

{"id": "2196661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196661", "title": "Slemish", "text": "Slemish\n\nSlemish, historically called Slieve Mish (), is a small mountain in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It lies a few miles east of Ballymena, in the townland of Carnstroan. Tradition holds that Saint Patrick, enslaved as a youth, was brought to this area and tended sheep herds on Slemish, and that during this time he found God.\n\nSlemish is the remains of the plug of an extinct volcano. The plug is made of olivine dolerite and was formed during the Palaeogene period of the Earth's geological history. Its distinctive appearance —its upper reaches are very steep and rugged, in contrast to the tidy fields on its lower westward-facing slopes and the relatively flat bogland to the east— causes it to dominate the landscape for miles around.\n\nSlemish is within an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and, therefore, helps to protect and manage the fragile animal and plant communities that inhabit its slopes. An ideal location for bird watchers, large black ravens, buzzards, wheatears and meadow pipits can be seen regularly.\n\nSlemish Mountain is the legendary first known Irish home of Saint Patrick. According to legend, following his capture and being brought to Ireland as a slave, Patrick worked as a shepherd at Slemish Mountain for about six years, from ages 16 to 22, for a man named Milchu (or Miluic).\n\nIt was during this time that Patrick turned to frequent prayer as his only consolation in his loneliness. In a vision he was encouraged to escape and return home.\n\nHe did this, then became a priest and returned to Ireland, allegedly to convert his old master. The legend goes that his own real conversion took place while on Slemish out in all weathers, communing with nature and praying continuously. As Patrick was not the first Christian Bishop to visit Ireland, his ministry was confined to the North. Here he established churches and an episcopal system. One such church is thought to have been founded at the nearby site of Skerry Churchyard.\n\nIn later times, Slemish was the site of a United Irish camp during the 1798 rebellion in County Antrim.\n\nSlemish Mountain is open year-round, and on Saint Patrick's Day (17 March) large crowds walk to the top of the mountain as a pilgrimage. The one and a half kilometre round walk to the summit and back takes approximately one hour in good weather. Excellent views can be had of the Antrim and Scottish coasts to the east. Ballymena town, Lough Neagh and the Sperrin Mountains are all normally visible to the west whilst the Bann Valley and the higher summits of the Antrim Hills can be seen to the North. The 180 metre climb is steep and rocky.\n\nThere is a parking facility with interpretation boards and washrooms on site.\n\nSlemish features in Dennis Kennedy's book \"Climbing Slemish\". The book chronicles the history of a family over a whole century of Northern Irish life.\n\nSee Annals of Inisfallen (AI)\n\n\n"}

Hired out primarily by Chicago politicians and organized crime groups (such as Al Capone's Chicago Outfit), the group was the first to use its services for labor unions. As an officer of the Chicago barbers union, as well as a leading manufacturer of barber supplies, Sangerman began using the gang to bomb barber shops which refused to agree to union regulations. With the gang's early success, Sangerman began accepting jobs from outside trade unions. By the time of Sangerman's arrest in 1925, the gang, by Sangerman's own admission, included a well-organized group of six members which was hired from $50 to $700. George Matrisciano, a leading member of the gang, was considered one of the best bomb makers in Chicago history. After receiving several indictments against him as a result of Sangerman's arrest, Matrisciano was killed before his testimony. A later investigation by the Illinois Crime Survey suspected several members of the barbers union; however, no charges were filed. Another famous member of the Bombers was Cornelius \"Con\" Shea.\n\nThe gang dissolved shortly afterward the conviction of Sangerman and Matrisciano's death. The use of bombings as a means of intimidation had become less favorable from the negative press coverage, specifically during the Aldermen's Wars of 1916-1921 and the 1928 Republican convention known as the \"Pineapple Primary\", drew too much attention and public outcry and by the end of the decade the Chicago underworld had returned to more discreet methods of intimidation. \n\n"}

The 508th is a parent regiment under the U.S. Army Regimental System, and two battalions from the regiment are currently active: the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment (1-508th PIR) is assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, and the 2nd Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment (2-508th PIR) is assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. The regiment served in combat during World War II, and regimental elements have served in combat in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment was activated during World War II on 20 October 1942 at Camp Blanding, Florida. Lieutenant Colonel Roy E. Lindquist formed the unit and remained its commander throughout the war.\n\nAfter extensive training and maneuvers the 508th embarked on 19 December 1943 in New York City, New York and sailed on 28 December 1943 for Belfast, Northern Ireland, arriving there on 8 January 1944. After additional training at Cromore Estate in Portstewart, the regiment was moved by ship to Glasgow in Scotland and by train on 13 March 1944 to Wollaton Park in Nottinghamshire, England, where they became part of the veteran 82nd \"All American\" Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, which had seen distinguished service in Sicily and Italy. A sister unit, the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment (later to become attached to the 17th Airborne Division), who were part of the 2nd Airborne Brigade with the 508th, were camped less than ten miles away at a former country hotel called Tollerton Hall, Nottinghamshire. During training in England Brigadier General James M. Gavin, the Assistant Division Commander (ADC), was particularly impressed with the regiment, noting that the 508th \"looks as good as any new outfit that I have ever seen, if they cannot do it it cannot be done by green troops.\"\n\nThe 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment participated in Operation Overlord, jumping into Normandy at 2:15 a.m. on 6 June 1944. Their immediate objectives were to capture Sainte-Mère-Église, secure crossings at the Merderet River near La Fiere and Chef-du-Pont, and establish a defensive line north from Neuville-au-Plain to Breuzeville-au-Plain. There they were to tie in with the 502nd Parachute Infantry, of Major General Maxwell Taylor's 101st Airborne Division. Like most paratroop units involved in Overlord, the 508th were dropped in the wrong locations and had extraordinary difficulty linking up with each other. During the assault on June 6, a platoon leader of the 508th, First Lieutenant Robert Mathias, of Company E of the 2nd Battalion, was the first American officer killed by German fire on D-Day.\n\nPortions of the 508th regrouped and remained in contact with German forces until relieved on 7 July when they became the divisional reserve force. On 13 July, they were transported back to England in two LSTs and returned to their station at Wollaton Park. Of the 2,056 paratroopers of the regiment who participated in the D-Day landings, only 995 returned. The 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment had, by this time, suffered 1,061 casualties, out of an initial strength on D-Day of 2,056. 307 had paid the ultimate price, including the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Herbert F. Batchellor, the highest-ranking officer to lose his life in the regiment.\n\nFor its gallantry and combat action during the first three days of fighting, the unit was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation (later re-designated as the Presidential Unit Citation), quoted in part below:\n\nAfter their success in Normandy, the 508th PIR returned to its billet at Wollaton Park and prepared for its part in Operation Market Garden, jumping on 17 September 1944. The regiment established and maintained a defensive position over in length, with German troops on three sides of their position. They seized a key bridge and prevented its destruction. Other units prevented the demolition of the Waal river Bridge at Nijmegen. The regiment additionally seized, occupied, organized and defended the Berg en Dal hill mass, terrain which controlled the Groesbeek-Nijmegen area. They cut Highway K, preventing the movement of enemy reserves, or escape of enemy along this important international route. After being relieved in the Netherlands, they continued fighting the Germans in the longest-running battle on German soil ever fought by the U.S. Army, then crossing the border into Belgium.\n\nThe 508th later played a major part in the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, during which they screened the withdrawal of some 20,000 troops from St. Vith and defended their positions against the German Panzer divisions. They also participated in the assault led by the 2nd Ranger Battalion to capture (successfully) Hill 400. The regiment saw little further service in the war and in April 1945 were detached from command of the 82nd Airborne Division, coming under direct control of the First Allied Airborne Army. Lindquist, now a full colonel, relinquished command of the regiment to Lieutenant Colonel Otho Holmes in December, 1945. The 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment returned to the United States soon after, settling at Camp Milner, New Jersey and was inactivated on 25 November 1946.\n\nThe following awards were received by individuals.\n\nThe 508th was reactivated as the separate 508th Airborne Regimental Combat Team 1951 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, served in Japan, and later moved to Fort Campbell where it once again inactivated in March 1957 as part of the reactivation of the 101st Airborne Division as a combat unit.\n\nWhen the Army abandoned the Pentomic battle group structure in the early 1960s, the 508th reorganized under the Combat Arms Regimental System as a parent regiment and at the same time was renamed the 508th Infantry. Within the 82d Airborne Division, the former Company A, 508th PIR was reorganized and re-designated as HHC, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry, an element of the 3d Brigade. The former Company B, 508th PIR was reactivated as HHC, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry, part of the 1st Brigade. The 1st and 2d Battalions, 508th Infantry continued to serve in the 82d Airborne Division. They served in Operation Powerpack in the Dominican Republic in 1965 and 1966.\n\nWhen the 3d Brigade was sent to Vietnam in response to the Tet Offensive in early 1968, 1-508th accompanied it. There it took part of the heavy fighting of Huế and the Tet counteroffensives. It was later awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. From 8 August 1962 to 26 June 1968, the lineage of Co C, 508 PIR was reactivated as HHC, 3-508th INF, and the unit served as an airborne battalion within the 193d Infantry Brigade in Panama. When the Airborne component of the battalion was reduced to a single company (Co A), the battalion was reflagged as the 3d Battalion, 5th Infantry.\n\nIn 1983 both battalions served in the Operation Urgent Fury with the invasion of Grenada.\n\nThe colors of 1st Battalion, 508th and 2d Battalion, 508th Infantry departed the 82d Airborne Division during an Army-wide reflagging of combat units in the 1980s, leaving the division with battalions of the 325th, 504th, and 505th within the 2d, 1st and 3d Brigades, respectively.\n\nThe 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry was activated as part of the 193rd Infantry Brigade from 1987 to 1995 at Fort Kobbe, Panama. The 1st Battalion fought during Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama. It was inactivated with the parent 193rd Infantry Brigade as US forces departed Panama in 1995.\n\nDuring Operation Just Cause, HHC, A Company, and B Company, were assigned to secure and hold Fort Amador. Company C was given a separate assignment, to secure and hold La Commandancia alongside elements of the 75th Ranger Regiment. During the battle for La Commandancia, Company C incurred the battalion's only Killed in Action (KIA) for the battalion: Private First Class Vance Coats and Sergeant Mike DeBlois.\n\nThe colors of 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry were reactivated in 1996 in Vicenza, Italy, by reflagging the existing 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry, an airborne battalion combat team, and was expanded in June 2000 to become the reactivated 173rd Airborne Brigade. The battalion had elements training all over Europe and participated in the Kosovo peacekeeping mission from 1996 to 2006.\n\nOn March 26, 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted the 44th combat jump in US history, dropping 965 paratroopers into northern Iraq to secure a lodgement at Bashur during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The 173rd was originally to be attached to the 4th Infantry Division but when Turkey refused the US permission to move the 4th Infantry Division through its territory, U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) ordered the 173rd to plan an airborne operation into Iraq. Without the 4th Infantry Division, Special Operations Forces (SOF) troops would be fully responsible for securing northern Iraq until conventional forces could fight their way up north from Kuwait.\n\nThe 173rd Airborne Brigade became subordinate to the Joint Special Operations Task Force-North (JSOTF-North) which marked the first in the integration of special and conventional forces during OIF. As the brigade prepared to jump, a small drop zone support team of Army and Air Force personnel moved forward separately to link up with SOF soldiers already on the ground in the vicinity of Bashur along with elements of the 74th Long Range Surveillance Detachment (LRSD) and Air Force tactical air controller in Constanta, Romania.\n\nAt 8:00 PM local time on March 26, 2003, five C-17s dropped 10 heavy drop platforms of vehicles and equipment. At 8:10 PM, 964 soldiers, including the brigade commander, Colonel William Mayville exited in 58 seconds. Only 32 jumpers did not make it out of the aircraft. The bulk of the airborne force came from the 1-508th Infantry Battalion (Airborne), led by Lieutenant Colonel Harry D. Tunnell, and the 2-503 Infantry Battalion (Airborne), led by Lieutenant Colonel Dominic Caraccilo. The 1-508 main effort had the mission to secure the southeast side of the Bashur Airfield and prepare the runway to receive C-17s within 6 hours of landing. The 2-503 would secure the northeast side of the objective. The remainder of the brigade combat team (BCT) included field artillery, Battery D, 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment, combat engineers, Stinger air defenders, from 173rd Combat Support Company (CSC), 74th LRSD, medics from the 401st Forward Support Company (FSC), a surgical team from the 250th Medical Detachment (Forward Surgical Team), Operational Detachment Alpha (-), 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, a public affairs officer on loan from the JSOTF-North, and U.S. Air Force airmen from the 86th Expeditionary Contingency Response Group and 4th Air Support Operations Squadron (-) (ASOS). 19 soldiers were injured during the jump, with four requiring evacuation back to Italy due to broken bones and joint dislocations.\n\nWith the ground and airfield secured, the rest of the brigade closed quickly. In the days following the jump, 12 C-17s landed per day, bringing in another 1,200 soldiers and vehicles from the brigade's assigned and attached units. Within 96-hours, 2,160 soldiers and 381 pieces of equipment was moved from Aviano Air Base, Italy to Bashur Airfield, Iraq, led by the 62nd and 446th Airlift Wings from McChord Air Force Base, Washington and 437th Airlift Wing and 315th Reserve Airlift Wing from Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina. Task Force 1-63 Armor flew in on additional 27 C-17 sorties. Although the 173rd played a crucial strategic role by establishing a significant conventional presence in northern Iraq, it did not engage in significant combat operations prior to the end of major combat operations. The brigade first saw action when it moved on Kirkuk on April 10, 2003, following the JSOTF-North's successful efforts to evict the Iraqi Republican Guard and Regular Army from the city. Once in Kirkuk, the 173rd was vital in establishing a secure environment for follow-on stability operations.\n\nIn 2005-2006 the 1st Battalion, as part of the 173d Airborne Brigade, deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. As part of Task Force Fury, they were deployed to the border on Pakistan in RC East where it served under the Command of Joint Task Force Devil (1st Brigade, 82d Airborne Division) at Orgun-E. Units were located across RC East in company FOBs at Waza Kwha, C Company (Rock); Bermel, A Company (Sharks); Sharana, HHC (Workhorse), and B Company (Legion). In June 2005 Legion was redeployed to RC South (Kandahar) under Task Force Gun Devil (3d Battalion, 319th Field Artillery). The battalion returned from Afghanistan in February 2006. The colors of 1-508th left the 173rd when the battalion was reflagged as 1-503d Infantry in June 2006.\n\nIn January 2006, the colors of both the 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment, were reactivated as infantry battalions in the newly activated 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. In January 2007, 1-508th, 2-508th, 4-73rd Cavalry (the 4th Brigade's Reconnaissance Squadron), 2-321 Field Artillery, and the 782nd Brigade Support Battalion deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In August 2009, the brigade returned to Afghanistan to support Operation Enduring Freedom, and 2-508 was sent to replace 1-17th Infantry Regiment after 1-17th encountered heavy losses due to large IED strikes and small arms encounters. / 5th SBCT/ 2ID in the Arghandab River Valley. After a year long deployment, each company from 2-508 was then replaced by battalions from the 101st Airborne division as well as elements from 4th Infantry Division's 1-12 Infantry Regiment. The Brigade returned to RC South (Zharay and Maywand) in 2012.\n\nAs part of Army-wide reductions and reorganizations, the 4th BCT was inactivated on 16 May 2014. The brigade's two infantry battalions, 1-508 PIR and 2-508 PIR were reassigned to the 82nd's 3rd BCT and 2nd BCT, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 1999. \"Rage Wars\" is a non-canon game in the \"Turok\" video game series, with a heavy emphasis on multiplayer. It supports a maximum of four players simultaneously via split-screen. The game also supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak for high-resolution graphics, but does not require it. A separate game, also titled \"\", which is set in the same fictional universe but features a different gameplay and storyline, was released for the Game Boy Color in 1999.\n\n\"Turok: Rage Wars\" is a first-person shooter with a heavy emphasis on multiplayer. It features three distinct modes of gameplay:\n\nSingle-Player Trials Mode - In the Single-Player Campaign, the player must go through a number of death matches through the various game mode types and must face all four game bosses as well. Each character in the game must be played to the end of their campaign at least once to unlock other characters and rewards, including Talismans and an increase in maximum health.\n\nTwo-Player Trials Mode - This mode is similar to the Single-Player Campaign with the addition of cooperative gameplay. Some rewards can only be gained in the Two-Player Campaign. In early copies of the game, the two-player trials mode was affected by a glitch which prevented progressing past a certain point.\n\nMultiplayer - In this mode, the player selects a character and level to play. The player starts with Turok, Adon, Bio Bot Elite, and Mantid Drone as the first playable characters, with more characters unlockable through the Single-Player Trials Mode. Multiplayer has several game type options, including, Bloodlust and Team Bloodlust, which are deathmatch-style games, Capture the Flag, and Monkey Tag, in which a random player is transformed into a monkey that other players can frag to score points. In this mode, the player can configure the options for gameplay before each game.\n\nThe game features weapons divided into three ammunition types: bullet rounds, energy rounds, and explosive rounds. A player may only carry six pre-selected weapons at one time. However, when playing as Tal'Set, the player has access to every weapon in the game at once.\n\nIn addition to weapons that can be picked up in-game, most arena maps contain a Power Core, a glowing pink-and-blue crystalline item floating in a set location. They are similar to the \"Power Ups\" in \"Quake III Arena\" and grant the player a randomly selected power. Each Power Core lasts approximately 15 to 20 seconds.\n\nThere are 50 medals that can be earned in the game to unlock cheats and character skins. Medals are awarded for completing a range of actions, from defeating bosses to committing suicides. One of the medals is impossible to achieve in the United States version of early (black-cartridge) copies of the game due to a Two-Player Trials glitch in the \"Creature Tag\" levels. Acclaim recognized this glitch and exchanged any black cartridges with fixed grey cartridges. The recalled variants weren't widely known, however, and have led to the grey cartridge variant of the game being a rare collector's item.\n\n\"Turok: Rage Wars\" was developed by Acclaim Studios Austin and conceived before \"\" was released. According to creative director Dave Dienstbier, the game \"was born out of knowing that we couldn't flesh out all our multiplayer ideas in \"Turok 2\" in time for the holiday season.\" The \"Turok 2\" engine was used as a basis to build the game.\n\nChris Kramer reviewed the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \"If you want a good multiplayer N64 game, pick up \"Quake II\" or go back to \"GoldenEye\".\"\n\n\"Turok: Rage Wars\" received mixed reviews, scoring a 72 overall on GameRankings based on 19 reviews. Game Industry News praised the game for its multiplayer, noting the extensive character selection and wide variety of battle grounds. GameCritics remarked that the \"graphics and animation are more than competent\" and the \"controls are also responsive and handle with considerable ease.\" \"Nintendo Power\" also praised the responsive controls, especially when aiming or shooting, but criticized the jumping ability for being challenging.\n\nThe game has been criticized for multiple issues. Although \"Edge\" praised the game's speed of play, well-defined arenas and varied weapons, the magazine described the single-player aspect as \"little more than a limited training ground for the multiplayer version\", thus questioning whether its price was actually justified. GameSpot stated similar cons and noted that the game's artificial intelligence \"can't stand up to any steady-handed human player.\" While the game does not require the RAM Expansion Pack, the reviewer felt that playing without it resulted in the game having \"mushy and quite ugly\" graphics. The Daily Radar noted that the \"audio feedback is lacking\" and \"the weapons interface, as well as the lack of ammo, makes the game frustrating.\"\n"}

In 1993, the Dundrum Bowl was closed due to flooding.\n\nDundrum Town Centre was opened on 3 March 2005. Over 5,000 people queued in the main square. Within 3 years, over 70 million people visited Dundrum Town Centre.\n\nThe centre has grown in phases and is divided into various districts. The \"Gallery\" district is located in the main building, the \"Pembroke\" district is locating around the Mill Pond, and the \"Dundrum South\" district is located outside the main Tesco overground car park.\n\nIn July 2016, the UK commercial property firm, Hammerson, bought control of Dundrum from Allianz for a reported £1.01 billion, and will own it jointly with Germany's Allianz Real Estate.\n\n\"Dundrum Town Centre\" was originally a local government term, defined by Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, before the shopping centre was built.

He was born in 1394 as the son of the Marquis della Chiesa in San Germano. He was well-educated due to being a noble and demonstrated a keen taste for the religious life and devoted himself to the service of God; he grew up with the hopes of becoming a religious himself. His distinguished father opposed this desire which later led to his son breaking off all links to his parents.\n\nAt the age of 20 – despite the protests of his parents – he became a member of the Order of Preachers in Vercelli and soon gained great recognition as an apt preacher and confessor. He accompanied Saint Bernardine of Siena on a range of missions and served in various capacities in the Dominican monasteries. Among those positions was that of the prior and he served at the friaries of Como and Florence as well as in Savona and Bologna. In Como he reformed the life and morals of the town and was sent to govern other friaries following this success. It was at those friaries that he insisted on a rigorous observance to their rule of life according to Saint Dominic.\n\nHe was also one of the leaders opposing the last of the antipopes: Felix V who troubled the Roman Catholic Church from 1440 until 1449. Felix V had a large support network stemming from Switzerland and della Chiesa opposed the work of the antipope. He managed to succeed in winning over a large number of the antipope's adherents to the lawful power of the true pontiff: Pope Eugene IV and later Pope Nicholas V.\n\nWhile on a trip from Savona to Genoa, pirates captured him, though della Chiesa was released unharmed. He had been apprehended with a fellow friar and the pirates released the pair after being so impressed with the demeanor of the two religious. He was a known miracle worker and was said to be able to read the consciences of men and women alike.\n\nHe died in 1459 and was able to predict the date of his death. His relics were translated on 28 July 1810 to his birthplace. Pope Pius VII affirmed his cultus and beatified della Chiesa on 15 May 1819, while setting his liturgical feast for 28 July – the date of the translation of his relics.\n\nHe is an ancestor of Giacomo della Chiesa – the future Pope Benedict XV (1854–1922) who reigned during World War I centuries after Antonio's own life.\n\nProcter, Lives of the Dominican Saints, pp. 210–213.

{"id": "2196719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196719", "title": "Value product", "text": "Value product\n\nThe value product (VP) is an economic concept formulated by Karl Marx in his critique of political economy during the 1860s, and used in Marxian social accounting theory for capitalist economies. Its annual monetary value is approximately equal to the netted sum of six flows of income generated by production: \n\n\nThe last five money-incomes are components of realized surplus value. In principle, the value product also includes unsold inventories of new outputs. Marx's concept corresponds roughly with the concept of value added in national accounts, with some important differences (see below) and with the provision that it applies only to the net output of \"capitalist\" production, not to the valuation of \"all\" production in a society, part of which may of course not be commercial production at all.\n\nThe concept is formulated more precisely when Marx considers the reproduction and distribution of the national income (see e.g. his manuscript called \"Results of the Immediate [or Direct] Process of Production\", available in English in the Pelican edition of \"Das Kapital\"), and also online; and the last chapters of \"Das Kapital\" Volume 3). \n\nMarx wrote this in 1864, i.e. about 70 years or so before the first comprehensive Gross National Product and Capital Formation statistics were pioneered by the likes of Wassily Leontief, Richard Stone, Simon Kuznets and Colin Clark (the United Nations standard accounting system was first finalised in 1953). Marx's manuscript for \"Das Kapital\" Vol. 3 ends with a discussion of \"relations of distribution\", but he did not live to complete his analysis. In outline his approach is quite clear however.\n\nMarx called gross output (or the total value of output sales) the \"\"value of production\"\" (\"VPn\").\n\nIf variable capital paid formula_1, circulating constant capital consumed formula_2, fixed capital consumed formula_3, and surplus value produced formula_4, then:\n\nand\n\nSo, Marx's \"value product\" really expressed his view of the true total \"new value added\" or the net product. In his view, this total is equal to the value of wage payments + surplus value, the latter which would include, apart from net profit, interest and rent, the net tax levy and royalty-type fees paid in respect of incomes generated by production of output, plus the surplus-value component of unsold inventories of new output. Marx himself never discussed taxation and royalty-income in detail; they were only a small portion of the total national income when he lived (around 5-10% or so).\n\nMarx claims that, in an accounting period, the workforce in the capitalist sector normally produces a new value which is equal to its own wage-cost, plus an additional new value (called surplus value).\n\nHowever, Marx warns that:\n\nFor this reason, Marx criticized ratios such as the \"share\" of profits and wages (wage share) in the gross or net product as deceptive, because they disguised the real capitalist relations of production, specifically the rate of surplus value. His primary interest was in the ratio between generic profits and wages (the rate of exploitation).\n\nThe equation of new value added with net output or GDP (also known as gross value added) would have made no sense to Marx, mainly because net output \"includes\" depreciation (or the consumption of fixed capital), yet \"excludes\" various property rents paid by producing enterprises from their gross income (on the ground that renting out an asset does not itself constitute production) as well as a portion of net interest (regarded as property income).\n\nAs regards depreciation, for Marx the value of \"real\" depreciation at least did not constitute any \"new\" value, but, value \"conserved\" and \"transferred\" to the new products by living labor. It appeared as added value, only because when costs are deducted from gross sales income to obtain net profit, depreciation is regarded as a component of the new \"gross\" profit income. In official national accounts, a distinction is made between gross value added (including depreciation charges) and net value added (excluding them).\n\nOf course, in reality it could be that real (\"economic\") depreciation diverges from depreciation for tax purposes. In that case, the reported consumption of fixed capital could contain an element of undistributed profit. Additionally, official national accounts may include in consumption of fixed capital the value of those \"insurance premiums, interest and rents\" paid from gross income, which relate directly to the acquisition or maintenance of productive fixed assets, on the ground that they are part of the cost of operating productive fixed assets. In Marxian economics, however, these flows would be regarded either as a faux frais of production, a circulating constant capital outlay, or an element of gross surplus value.\n\nBy contrast, Marx considered rents paid by producing enterprises from their gross income as a part of surp-lus value, and as an integral part of the cost structure of the social product. Business rents, excluded as intermediate expenditures from GDP, therefore are included in the Marxian value product as a component of surplus value.\n\nFrom a Marxian point of view, official value added also includes some dubious components such as the rental value of owner-occupied housing. This entry is the market rent of owner-occupied housing that would apply \"if\" the housing was rented, treated as a \"service\". But most of it does not refer to any real flow of income, nor is it clear that this component has anything to do with production.\n\nAs regards net interest, the official product accounts will exclude a portion of it, insofar as it is defined as \"property income\" unrelated to the value of production. But if it is paid from current gross revenues of producing enterprises, then it should be included in the Marxian value product. For this reason, the Marxian net interest aggregate is likely to be larger than the official one. \n\nMarx's idea of value creation and value product makes little sense from the point of view of the theory of factors of production and production functions. \n\nMarx himself already anticipated this, in chapter 48 of Capital Vol. 3, titled \"The Trinity Formula\" where he discusses the view that land, labour and capital (which he sarcastically calls the \"holy trinity\" of political economy) all create a new value equal to factor income (Marx regarded human labour and land as the mainsprings of material wealth, but he considered \"value\" as a purely \"social\" attribution referring to labor-content). In modern macroeconomics, the controversy surfaces again, and is discussed in amusing essays by Prof. Anwar Shaikh (see references).\n\nIn Marxian social accounting, one theoretical controversy concerns the treatment of the wages of so-called productive and unproductive labour. \"Unproductive labour\" by definition does not make net additions to the new value product, but only \"transfers\" value from other sectors on the basis that it reduces the costs of capitalist production. Depending on how the gross and net product are defined, the value of these wages could be accounted for either as a component of surplus value, or as a circulating constant capital outlay, or be \"excluded\" from the value product altogether. \n\nDifferent interpretations are offered by Shane Mage, Murray Smith, Anwar Shaikh and Fred Moseley. One aspect often overlooked in this controversy is that wages costs and labour costs are not the same thing. Employers and employees must also pay social insurance levies of various types, and there may be other imposts on wages; also, the \"buying power\" of wages is reduced by indirect tax imposts and profit imposts. This affects the magnitude of a society's variable capital and the value of labour power.\n\nAnother Marxian accounting controversy, less discussed, concerns which net tax receipts of government constitute part of the new value product.\nObviously taxes included in official gross product measures do not equal the net total tax take, because some taxes are unrelated to production and therefore excluded. The Marxian critique of public finance appears to be rather undeveloped as yet, however. In principle, net tax levied on current production and paid out of current gross revenues would be included in the value product.\n\nLeast discussed is the problem of finding a non-arbitrary, rigorous distinction between value created and value transferred in respect of services. The conceptual problem here is essentially that it may be difficult to specify unambiguously what the nature and function of the \"product\" sold is, when services are rendered.\n\nSome Marxists have argued however that Marx's value relations and value aggregates cannot be measured at all, and at best only experienced. That was manifestly not Marx's view; already in his \"Grundrisse\" manuscript he had referred to a balance sheet cited by Malthus; in Das Kapital he attempted to calculate the rate of surplus value according to data provided by Frederick Engels; and towards the end of his life, as Leontief noted, he wrote that he wanted to study the \"ups and downs\" of economic activity mathematically (but Samuel Moore convinced him that the data to do it did not exist yet). Engels later remarked that the problem really was that much data relevant to testing Marx's concepts simply was not available. \n\nSubsequent Marxian scholars have argued the critique of political economy should continue, with regard to the new economic concepts and theories, rather than stop at the point where the ink dried on the last sheet of paper that Marx wrote on. One reason is that the new concepts and theories might distort the representation of economic reality, just as much as the old ones that Marx criticized.\n\nIn the USSR and other Soviet-type societies, Marx's social accounting approach strongly influenced the Material Product System (MPS), a social accounting method alternative to GDP accounts, which distinguished sharply between \"productive\" and \"non-productive\" sectors of the economy. These accounts focused on balances of the value of material goods produced. In some respects, this is ironic, since Marx's social accounting referred to the capitalist economy, not to a socialist economy. The MPS accounts were abandoned in favour of GDP accounts after the downfall of official communism in the USSR and Eastern Europe, although they are still compiled as parallel accounts in North Korea and Cuba.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2196749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196749", "title": "Toirdelbach Ua Briain", "text": "Toirdelbach Ua Briain\n\nToirdhealbhach Ua Briain (old spelling: Toirdelbach Ua Briain), anglicised \"Turlough O'Brien\" (100914 July 1086), was King of Munster and effectively High King of Ireland. A grandson of Brian Bóruma, Toirdelbach was the son of Tadc mac Briain who was killed in 1023 by his half-brother Donnchad mac Briain.\n\nFor the first forty years of his life nothing is known of Toirdelbach. It was not until the 1050s that he found allies in Connacht and in Leinster, particularly the powerful King of Leinster Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, who would aid his claims to be ruler of Munster. It took perhaps ten years of sustained attack to remove his uncle Donnchad from power, and send him into exile, and to place Toirdelbach in power in Munster as Diarmait's faithful ally.\n\nOn Diarmait's death Toirdelbach took over the reins of power, establishing himself as ruler of more than half of Ireland. While not a great military leader, he was a capable politician whose influence extended as far north as Ulaid and who made and unmade Kings of Connacht. He died after more than two decades in power, following a lengthy illness, still in control of events. His son Muirchertach Ua Briain would be the leading king of his day, and his grandson Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair would be greater yet.\n\nToirdelbach was the son of Tadc mac Briain, son of Brian Bóruma, and Mór, daughter of Gilla Brigte Ua Maíl Muaid of Cenél Fiachach. His father was killed in 1023, probably on the orders of his half-brother Donnchad mac Briain who thereby made himself king of Munster. Donnchad, while he successfully retained control of Munster for four decades, was never able to achieve the same success as Brian. Epigraphic evidence shows that he aimed to be king of Ireland, and perhaps considered himself to be such, but the annalists and later historians recognised no such pretensions.\n\nAs for Toirdelbach, the annals record nothing of him until the 1050s, at which time he was seeking, and finding, outside assistance against his uncle. Donnchad's main rivals were Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, King of Leinster from 1042, and Áed in Gaí Bernaig, King of Connacht from 1046. Diarmait in particular was a serious threat; allied with Niall mac Eochada, King of Ulster, he installed his son Murchad as ruler of Dublin in 1052, driving out Donnchad's brother-in-law and ally Echmarcach mac Ragnaill. From the beginning of the 1050s onwards, Donnchad came under sustained attack from both Áed and Diarmait. Toirdelbach first joined with Áed in the early 1050s, raiding into Tuadmumu in 1052 and inflicting a heavy defeat on Donnchad's son Murchad in Corco Mruad, the north-west of modern County Clare in 1055. By 1058 Toirdelbach had gained Diarmait's support, for he was present when Diarmait, the Leinstermen and the Osraige drove Donnchad from Limerick, which he burned so that it would not fall into the hands of his enemies, and defeated him at Sliabh gCrot in the Galtee Mountains.\n\nIn 1060 Donnchad attempted to divide his enemies by submitting to Áed. This was unsuccessful as Áed attacked again in 1061, razing the Dál gCais fortress at Kincora and burning their church at Killaloe. Injury was added to insult when Diarmait brought an army, and Toirdelbach in his train, to Munster in 1062. Donnchad's son Murchad led the unsuccessful resistance, and even when Diarmait returned to Leinster, Toirdelbach defeated his kinsmen. By 1063, Donnchad was beaten. Deposed, he went on pilgrimage to Rome where he died the following year. Diarmait installed Toirdelbach as a puppet king in Munster.\n\nFollowing Donnchad's deposition, Toirdelbach was one of Diarmait's key allies, particularly in Diarmait's final years when his authority was challenged within Leinster. In 1066 Diarmait and Toirdelbach each paid 30 ounces of gold to the king of Ciarraige Luachra of West Munster for his help in assassinating their enemies. In 1067 they campaigned together to defeat and kill the king of Ciarraige Luachra. Toirdelbach's nephew Murchad son of Donnchad was killed in 1068 while raiding in the midlands.\n\nThe \"Annals of Innisfallen\" record to Toirdelbach as a lawmaker, reporting that in 1068: \"A law and ordinance was made by Tairdelbach Ua Briain-and no better law was enacted in Mumu for a long time—with the result that neither cow nor horse was housed [at night] but allowed to wander at will.\" In the same year, and perhaps related to this law-making, Máel Ísu mac Amalgada, \"comarba Pátraic\" or abbot of Armagh and successor of Saint Patrick, visited Munster for the first time and received \"his full visitation, both in tribute and offerings\".\n\nToirdelbach's ally and protector Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó faced increasing difficulties in his final years, difficulties which led Toirdelbach to intervene on Diarmait's behalf against his enemies in Leinster. Diarmait's sons Murchad and Glúniairn died in 1070, leaving the succession uncertain and disputed. Later in 1070 Toirdelbach took an army into Leinster, carrying off hostages, and receiving the submission of the king of Osraige. Toirdelbach had to return to Leinster again in 1071 open warfare broke out between Diarmait's grandson Domnall, Murchad's son, and his nephew Donnchad, son of Domnall Remair. The annal states that the hostages Toirdelbach took were handed over into the keeping of Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó. Toirdelbach was not idle on his own account in these years. He led an army on a raid into the midlands in 1071, and had his soldiers build wooden bridges across the Shannon, evidently for military purposes, at \"Áth Caille\" (perhaps modern O'Briensbridge) and Killaloe.\n\nDiarmait visited Munster in 1071, distributing gifts. Diarmait had earlier given Toirdelbach treasures which included Brian Bóruma's sword, and \"the standard of the king of the Saxons\". This was among Diarmait's last recorded acts before his death in battle on 7 February 1072.\n\nToirdelbach was the chief beneficiary of Diarmait's death, the \"Annals of Innisfallen\" recording that:Toirdelbach Ua Briain went to Osraige and Leinster, burned Uí Cheinnselaig and brought away much booty and cows, and took hostages from it as well as from Leinster. And the foreigners gave him the kingship of Dublin, and he made prisoner the sons of Domnall, son of Máel na mBó, in Dublin, and brought back the hostages of Osraige on that occasion. Conchobar Ua Máel Shechnaill, king of Mide, was murdered the next year, and Toirdelbach took advantage of this to ravage the midlands, followed by an expedition to Connacht where he obtained hostages from both the Uí Conchobair and the Uí Ruairc. He divided Leinster between various rivals, a policy of divide and rule which would serve him well. In Dublin he installed one Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, perhaps a kinsman of Echmarcach, as his client king.\n\nA campaign in 1075 directed against the Uí Néill and their allies in the north turned out less well. Toirdelbach's son Muirchertach was defeated by the Airgíalla near Áth Fhirdia (modern Ardee, County Louth) with heavy loss. At more or less the same time Gofraid was banished from Dublin by Toirdelbach, seemingly replaced by Domnall son of Murchad son of Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, who ruled for only a short time before he died, and was replaced by Toirdelbach's son Muirchertach. With Muirchertach securely installed in Dublin, and another son, Diarmait, ruling over Waterford, Toirdelbach was master of half of Ireland.\n\nWhile Toirdelbach's son Diarmait, ruler of Waterford, raided Wales in 1080, in general Toirdelbach is seen as less interested in matters outwith Ireland than his protector Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó, or his son Muirchertach.\n\nIt was during Gofraid's short reign over Dublin, on 6 May 1074, that Donatus, first archbishop of Dublin died. This led the archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc of Pavia, to take an interest in Irish matters. Lanfranc, basing himself, he said, on Bede's writings, had already assured Pope Alexander II that Dublin formed part of the province of Canterbury and that it was for him to consecrate the new bishop. He also wrote to the Irish kings concerned, being careful not to cause offence. His letter to Toirdelbach calls him \"magnificent king of Ireland\", a title which might seem the more impressive had Lanfranc not also addressed Gofraid of Dublin as \"glorious king of Ireland\".\n\nThe \"Annals of Innisfallen\" report that \"five Jews came from over sea with gifts to Toirdelbach, and they were sent back again over sea\". The meaning and significance of this event is unclear. Hudson remarks that \"[i]f the delegation wanted [Toirdelbach]'s approval for settling in Ireland they were disappointed\". Bracken suggests that if this was the intention of the delegation, the otherwise astute Toirdelbach missed a significant opportunity to strengthen his position.\n\nToirdelbach employed the policy of divide and rule to maintain control of Leinster and to prevent the emergence of a rival in Connacht. In the north, he supported the Ulaid to weaken the Cenél nEógain kings of Ailech. This policy was successful in keeping Leinster pacified, but was less successful in dealing with the Cenél nEógain of the north and the kings of Connacht in the west.\n\nThe Cenél nEógain, who appear to have had no widely accepted candidates for the kingship, hit upon a candidate in the person of Conchobar Ua Briain, grandson of Toirdelbach's uncle Donnchad mac Briain and Toirdelbach's most obvious rival for the kingship of Munster. Conchobar was king for only a short time when he was murdered, along with his wife. His brother Cennétig was chosen to succeed him.\n\nIn Connacht, three rival branches of the Uí Briúin, the Ua Conchobair, the Ua Flaithbertaig, and the Ua Ruairc, were in competition. Ruaidrí na Saide Buide of the Ua Conchobair was king of Connacht when he submitted to Toirdelbach in 1076. Toirdelbach deposed Ruaidrí in 1079 and replaced him with an Ua Ruairc, Áed son of Art Uallach.\n\nThe Ua Ruairc proved to be a threat to Toirdelbach and to their neighbours. Máel Sechnaill, king of Mide, submitted to Toirdelbach in 1080, perhaps for fear of Ua Ruairc. War broke out in 1084 between Toirdelbach and the Ua Ruairc, joined by Cennétig Ua Briain. Toirdelbach raided Mide, but while he was absent the Conmaicne, clients of the Ua Ruairc, raided Munster. A battle was fought at Monecronock, near modern Leixlip, on 19 October 1082 where Toirdelbach's sons Muirchertach and Tadc won, killing Domnall Ua Ruairc and Cennétig Ua Briain.\n\nToirdelbach fell seriously ill in 1085 and lost his hair. The \"Annals of the Four Masters\", a late and not always reliable source, state that he had been ill for many years. He may never have fully recovered from his earlier illness. The \"Annals of Ulster\" report that he \"died in Kincora [near Killaloe] after great suffering and long repentance, and after receiving the Body of Christ and His Blood, on [14 July] in the seventy-seventh year of his age [1086]\". Rarely given to over-praising southern kings, this northern annal calls him \"king of Ireland\". The \"Annals of Tigernach\", another northern record, styles Toirdelbach \"rí urmóir Erenn\", \"king of the greater part of Ireland\".\n\nToirdelbach was probably married three times. Dubchoblaig of the Uí Cheinnselaig, who died in 1088, was the mother of Diarmait, perhaps named for her kinsman and Toirdelbach's protector Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó. Derbforgaill of Osraige was the mother of Tadc and Muirchertach. No children of Gormlaith of Ua Fógarta are named and the mother of Toirdelbach's daughter Mór is not recorded.\n\nMór married Ruaidrí na Saide Buide. Her son Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair was one of the greatest kings of medieval Ireland. She died in 1088, perhaps coincidentally the year in which a gloss to the \"Annals of Ulster\" records Toirdelbach's birth. Toirdelbach apparently planned to divide his lands between his three sons. Tadc survived him by only weeks, dying of natural causes at Kincora, after which Muircheartach and Diarmait disputed the succession. Diarmait was the loser, banished by his half-brother, and exiled with his mother's kin in Leinster.\n\n"}

There were also described number of fossil \"Biomphalaria\" species.\n\nAmerican species include:\n\nOld World (Africa, Madagascar and the Middle East) species include:\n\nThere is one known hybrid \"Biomphalaria glabrata × Biomphalaria alexandrina\" from Egypt.\n\nA cladogram showing phylogenic relations of (23 analyzed) species in the genus \"Biomphalaria\":\n\nThe origin of the genus \"Biomphalaria\" is American. The ancestor of \"Biomphalaria glabrata\" colonized Africa 2.3–4.5 or 2-5 millions years ago and speciated into all the African \"Biomphalaria\" species.\n\nNatural populations of these snails are usually found in tropical standing water or freshwater in South America and Africa, but they also reach 30° latitude in subtropical areas. Many species of these red-blooded planorbid snails (Gastropoda: Basommatophora) are able to survive a long time when removed from their freshwater habitat. Of the 34 \"Biomphalaria\" species, 4 (\"Biomphalaria glabrata\", \"Biomphalaria pfeifferi\", \"Biomphalaria straminea\", and \"Biomphalaria tenagophila\") have recently expanded their native ranges. They have been introduced to areas where other \"Biomphalaria\" species are endemic (e.g., Congo and Egypt) or to subtropical zones that have no frost period (Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Hong Kong).\n\nAll species in the genus \"Biomphalaria\" except of native \"Biomphalaria obstructa\" has not yet become established in the US, but they are considered to represent a potentially serious threat as a pest, an invasive species which could negatively affect agriculture, natural ecosystems, human health or commerce. Therefore, it has been suggested that this species be given top national quarantine significance in the USA.\n\nThis genus of snails is medically important, because the snails can carry a parasite of humans which represents a serious disease risk: the snails serve as an intermediate host (vector) for the human parasitic blood fluke, \"Schistosoma mansoni\", that infects about 83 million people.\n\nThe human disease schistosomiasis (aka snail fever) caused by all \"Schistosoma\" species (transmitted also by other snails) infects 200 million people. The fluke, which is found primarily in tropical areas, infects mammals (including humans) via contact with water that contains schistosome larvae (cercariae) which have previously been released from the snail. Infection occurs via penetration of cercariae through the skin.\n\nEighteen species of \"Biomphalaria\" are intermediate hosts for \"Schistosoma mansoni\"; seven species of the genus have not been tested for this susceptibility and nine species are resistant.\n\nAltogether about 30 species of parasites from Africa and at least 20 species from the Neotropics are known to parasitize \"Biomphalaria\".\n\nThis article incorporates public domain text from the Majoros \"et al.\" reference.\n"}
{"id": "2196778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196778", "title": "Marmion (poem)", "text": "Marmion (poem)\n\nMarmion: A Tale of Flodden Field is a historical romance in verse of 16th-century Britain by Sir Walter Scott, published in 1808. It concludes with the Battle of Flodden in 1513. It was published in Edinburgh, printed by Ballantyne and Co. for Archibald Constable and also in London by William Miller and John Murray.\n\nIn November 1806, Scott started writing \"Marmion\", his second major work. When Archibald Constable, the publisher, learnt of this, he offered a thousand guineas for the copyright unseen. William Miller and John Murray each agreed to take a 25% share in the project. Murray observed: \"We both view it as honourable, profitable, and glorious to be concerned in the publication of a new poem by Walter Scott.\" Scott said that he thoroughly enjoyed writing the work. He told his son-in-law, Lockhart: \"Oh, man, I had many a grand gallop among these braes when I was thinking of \"Marmion\".\"\n\nIn 1807, Scott practised manoeuvres with the Light Horse Volunteers (formed to defend against invasion from France) in order to polish his description of the battle at Flodden.\n\nOn 22 January 1808, \"Marmion\" was finished, and it was published on 22 February 1808 in a quarto first edition of two thousand copies. This edition, priced at one and a half guineas, a high price, sold out in a month. It was followed by twelve octavo editions between 1808 and 1825. \"Previously to 1825, no fewer than thirty-six thousand copies of Marmion were sold.\"\n\nThe poem tells how Lord Marmion, a favourite of Henry VIII of England, lusts for Clara de Clare, a rich woman. He and his mistress, Constance De Beverley, forge a letter implicating Clara's fiancé, Sir Ralph De Wilton, in treason. Constance, a dishonest nun, hopes that her aid will restore her to favour with Marmion. When De Wilton loses the duel he claims in order to defend his honour against Marmion, he is obliged to go into exile. Clara retires to a convent rather than risk Marmion's attentions. \n\nConstance's hopes of a reconciliation with Marmion are dashed when he abandons her; she ends up being walled up alive in the Lindisfarne convent for breaking her vows. She takes her revenge by giving the Abbess, who is one of her three judges, documents that prove De Wilton's innocence. De Wilton, having returned disguised as a pilgrim, follows Marmion to Edinburgh where he meets the Abbess, who gives him the exonerating documents. When Marmion's host, the Earl of Angus is shown the documents, he arms De Wilton and accepts him as a knight again. De Wilton's plans for revenge are overturned by the Battle of Flodden. Marmion dies on the battlefield, while De Wilton displays heroism, regains his honour, retrieves his lands, and marries Clara.\n\n\"Marmion\" is a narrative poem with varied meters, \"here, rhymed couplets in iambic tetrameter, there, iambic pentameter using alternating rhyme, still elsewhere, hymn meter using a combination of alternating and nested rhyme\".\n\nTo his contemporaries, Scott introduced \"a very modern and new form of poetry. He ended the dominance of the heroic couplet and the pentameter, and introduced a more flexible ‘light horseman sort of stanza’\".\n\nThe book was a huge and lasting success in both Britain and the United States, but it did not find favour with critics at the time. The introductory letters to Scott's friends that open each canto were dismissed by the critics as unwarranted intrusions. A hero as flawed as Marmion was also unwelcome at the time, and the story was criticised for its obscurity. \n\nFrancis Jeffrey published a particularly harsh review in the \"Edinburgh Review\". He observed that much of the verse was \"flat and tedious\", and he accused Scott of simply showing off his historical erudition. He also objected to the anachronism of the chivalric code and opposed the warlike sentiments of the introductory epistles. All of Europe was at war when this poem was published, embroiled in the lengthy Napoleonic Wars. Nevertheless, the public enthusiasm for Scott's work was undimmed and the poem remained popular for over a century. The stanzas telling the story of \"young Lochinvar\" from Canto V particularly caught the public imagination and were widely published in anthologies and learned as a recitation piece. The Brontë sisters were also admirers of \"Marmion\". It is mentioned in \"Jane Eyre\" when St. John Rivers gives the poem to Jane. Similarly, in Anne Brontë's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1848), Gilbert Markham - the supposed author - gives a copy of \"Marmion\" to the central character, Mrs Graham. \n\nOne of the most quoted excerpts from Scottish poetry is derived from Canto VI, stanza XVII (although it is often erroneously attributed to Shakespeare):\n\n"}

It would not be until December 1971 that the station signed on. It had been rebadged XHERS-FM and was operated by Paul Schafer's Time Sales Inc. from the United States. Time Sales, which also held the operating rights to XHIS-FM 90.3, ran the two stations as a cluster: XHIS \"HIS Radio\" and XHERS \"HERS Radio\". The stations' programming was produced at the Time Sales studios, at the Royal Inn at the Wharf in San Diego. While HIS Radio carried a hard-edge progressive rock format, HERS was programmed with softer rock.\n\nNot long after signing on, the Time Sales cluster began running into various legal problems. The confluence of a new bilateral radio agreement which would regulate border radio (and required XHERS to move to 104.5), San Diego broadcasters who did not like the competition of Mexican stations targeting the US, and a US Federal Communications Commission investigation did the cluster in. In August 1974, the FCC ruled that Schafer and Time Sales violated the Brinkley Act with their operation; the resulting legal action bankrupted Schafer. XHERS was listed in publications in this period as having a \"soul music\" format.\n\nBy 1979, Vargas Gómez, who never incorporated XHERS into the MVS Radio operation, sold the station to XHERS, S.A., a concessionaire owned and operated by Califórmula Broadcasting and the owner of XHIS. In 1981, XHERS was broadcasting a beautiful music format when the Califórmula cluster was hit by a strike called by STIRT, the Mexican broadcast workers' union, over a program critical of the Governor of Baja California. The strike forced Díaz to sell to Organización Radio Centro and its head, Francisco Aguirre, which brought an end to the action after two months. Two years later, Díaz bought back the stations and relaunched them with new formats and callsigns. The callsign was changed to XHLTN-FM in February 1984, coinciding with the change to the Radio Latina name and format.\n\nIn 1993, two workers died on the XHLTN tower. They were installing a large piece of transmission equipment, to which they were harnessed, when a cable gave way and the workers fell to their deaths.\n\nXHLTN was acquired by Grupo Imagen in 2004.\n\n"}

This form of animal deception is an adaptive behavior also known as tonic immobility or thanatosis. Apparent death can be used as a defense mechanism or as a form of aggressive mimicry, and occurs in a wide range of animals.\n\nWhen induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as animal hypnosis. According to Gilman et al., the investigation of \"animal hypnosis\" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by Athanasius Kircher.\n\nTonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily paralysed and unresponsive to external stimuli. In most cases this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator. However, in sharks exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.\n\nDespite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility. Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.\n\nSome sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. dogfish sharks, lemon sharks, whitetip reef sharks. For tiger sharks (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour. Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical shark repellent has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery. Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.\n\nScientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.\n\nIt has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.\n\nGoldfish, trout, rudd, tench, brown bullhead, medaka, paradise fish, and topminnow have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs. Oscars seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour. A similar behavior has been reported for convict tangs in the field.\n\nTonic immobility can be reliably induced in iguanas by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular. The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.\n\nTonic immobility can also be induced in the Carolina anole. The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.\n\nIn 2006, a single study in rabbits tried to find a link between a fear-motivated stress state and some of the physiological responses induced by tonic immobility. Researchers observed an increase in heart rate and breathing immediately following periods of tonic immobility, and while these comprise an expected physiologic reaction to sudden position change, the data were nonetheless used to advance a conclusion that despite the appearance of deep relaxation, the rabbits are actually in fear for their lives. While the study failed to explore why rabbits seem to enjoy self-induction of tonic immobility and are sometimes found sleeping on their backs, it is now routinely cited to support a notion that rabbits actually hate what they appear to enjoy. The researchers did allow for induction of tonic immobility in rabbits as appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.\n\nSee Chicken hypnotism.\n\nTonic immobility has been viewed in some duck species.\n\nTonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault.\n\nThere is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning. Thus, defensive immobilization is hypothesized to have played a crucial role in the evolution of human parent-child attachment, sustained attention and suggestibility, REM sleep and theory of mind.\n\nTonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation. It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970. The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.\n\nTo induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds. This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck. Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.\n\nTonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens, hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels, hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor, and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.\n\nTonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits and pigs.\n\nIn animal behaviour, thanatosis (from the Greek noun , meaning \"putting to death\"; \"cf. \": Thanatos) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a prey evading a predator, a male trying to mate with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The French biologist Georges Pasteur classifies it as a form of \"self-mimesis\", a form of camouflage or mimicry in which the \"mimic\" imitates itself in a dead state.\n\nFor defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.\n\nIn beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced, which suggests that thanatosis is indeed adaptive.\n\nIn the hog-nosed snake, a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as cats, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when rats try to eat them.\n\nIn mammals, the Virginia opossum is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. \"Playing possum\" is an idiomatic phrase which means \"pretending to be dead\". It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened. This instinct does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging roadkill may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.\n\nThe usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a brown bear is to lie face down, cover the face with one’s hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.\n\n\"Playing possum\" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, unconscious, asleep, or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.\n\nThanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp \"Nasonia vitripennis\", and the cricket, \"Gryllus bimaculatus\".\n\nIn the spider species \"Pisaura mirabilis\", male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of gift-giving and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.\n\n\"Nimbochromis\" (sleeper cichlids), endemic to Lake Malawi in East Africa, are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. \"N. livingstoni\" then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close. A similar strategy has also been observed in the African cichlid \"Lamprologus lemairii\" from Lake Tanganyika and in the Central American yellowjacket cichlid \"Parachromis friedrichsthalii\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2196797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196797", "title": "Internet chess server", "text": "Internet chess server\n\nAn Internet chess server (ICS) is an external server that provides the facility to play, discuss, and view the board game of chess over the Internet. The term specifically refers to facilities for connecting players through a variety of graphical chess clients located on each user's computer.\n\nIn the 1970s, one could play correspondence chess in a PLATO System program called 'chess3'. Several users used chess3 regularly; often a particular user would make several moves per day, sometimes with several games simultaneously in progress. In theory one could use chess3 to play a complete game of chess in one sitting, but chess3 was not usually used this way. PLATO was not connected to Internet predecessor ARPANET in any way that allowed mass use by the public, and consequently, chess3 was and still is relatively unknown to the public.\n\nIn the eighties, chess play by email was still fairly novel. Latency with email was less than with traditional correspondence chess via paper letters. Often one could complete a dozen moves in a week. As network technology improved, public, widespread use of a centralised server for live play became a possibility.\n\nMichael Moore, of the University of Utah, and Richard Nash recognised the potential of an Internet chess server and created its first incarnation, hosted at lark.utah.edu and accessible through telnet. The official opening date of the ICS was January 15, 1992. John Chanak, William Kish, and Aaron Putnam moved the server to a host machine at Carnegie Mellon University in July 1992, and took over its operation. Although it was buggy and suffered from lag problems, the server was popular among a small group of chess enthusiasts. Over time, many features were added to the ICS, such as Elo ratings and support for graphical clients, and the server was made more stable.\n\nIn late 1992, Daniel Sleator, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, took over management of the ICS. He addressed, among other issues, the frequent complaint that players would lose blitz games on time due to network lag. In 1994, he copyrighted the code, and began receiving purchase offers from companies wanting to commercialise the server. There were questions about whether Sleator was right to claim that the ICS was his intellectual property, since he did not code the original server, although he had made substantial improvements to its code.\n\nOn March 1, 1995, Sleator announced his intentions to commercialise ICS himself, renaming it the Internet Chess Club, or ICC, and charging a yearly membership fee of $US 49 ($US 59.95 in 2007). This announcement was highly controversial among existing members. Many volunteers who had contributed in various ways to the flourishing of ICS were upset that anyone would attempt to profit from their efforts. Active players on the server who were used to the service being provided without charge were not pleased with the addition of the membership fee.\n\nA handful of programmers who had worked on the original ICS became unhappy with what they saw as the commoditization of their project. They formed the Free Internet Chess Server (FICS), and continued to allow everyone to have access to all features for free. In 1996, John Fanning, uncle of Napster founder Shawn Fanning, started Chess.net, a commercial Internet chess server to rival ICS. Both services remain operational today.\n\nThe ICS protocol is a simple, text-based variant of the TELNET protocol. It is sparsely documented and not standardised, although a few reference implementations and several clients exist.\n\nIn theory, an ICS can be accessed from any TELNET client. However, almost all users choose to play using a graphical client, called an interface. Currently, the most popular interface is XBoard (and its Windows counterpart, WinBoard). In recent years, however, it has lost ground to newer interfaces like Pychess and eboard. XICS is an X graphical interface to any Internet chess server. Unlike earlier text-based ICS clients, XICS allows the players to see the board and play pieces graphically, usually in a 2-D configuration.\n\nIn addition to standalone clients, many servers also offer Java interfaces that can be used directly from a Web browser. These are popular with new users and users of public computers.\n\nOver the years, several Internet chess servers have been created. The most popular are Chess.com, Chesshub.com, Lichess.org, ICC, Playchess.com, FICS, and Chesscube. Chess is also among the games previously offered by non-specialist site Yahoo! Games.\n\n\n"}

Dew\n\nSheri Linn Dew (born November 21, 1953) is an American author, publisher, the executive vice president of Deseret Management Corporation, and chief executive officer of the Deseret Book Company, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Dew has also been a religious leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and an inspirational speaker. In 2003, she was described as “the most prominent single [unmarried] LDS woman right now.”\n\nDeseret Book Company owns two retail chains (Deseret Book and Seagull), two publishing companies (Deseret Book and Covenant), an events division (Time Out for Women), a digital division, a magazine (\"LDS Living\") and a film-distribution company (Excel).\n\nDew was born November 21, 1953, in Ulysses, Kansas, to Charles and JoAnn Peterson Dew. The oldest of five children, she grew up on a \"sprawling grain farm\" and attended local schools. Of this time, she has said:\n\nI drove a tractor almost as soon as I could reach the pedals. I know how to set an irrigation tube, and I helped with the harvest. . . . On the farm you learn early that you reap what you sow. . . . I am innately very shy, and I have struggled with that challenge for years. My work has helped because I’ve had to interview people from all walks of life.\n\nDew told interviewers in 2002 and 2004 that as a teenager she was 5 feet, 10 inches tall and was a standout in high school basketball, averaging 23 points and 17 rebounds a game. A \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" reporter wrote in 2012 that Dew had the \"friendly, no-nonsense manner\" of a high school basketball coach.\" Another writer noted in 2010 that Dew's \"confident and collected demeanor always kept her on task.\" \n\nShe learned the piano and traveled on three USO tours to Alaska, Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia as an accompanist during her college years at Brigham Young University (BYU), where she earned a bachelor's degree in history, with an emphasis in American religious history.\n\nDew is close friends with Wendy Watson Nelson, and they presented together at the 2016 RootsTech conference.\n\nAfter graduating from BYU, Dew moved into the publishing business associated with the LDS Church, starting out as an assistant editor at Bookcraft beginning in 1978. She spent the next six years as an editor and associate publisher at \"This People\" magazine.\n\nDew joined Deseret Book in 1988 as an associate editor and became director of publishing in 1989, vice president of publishing in 1993, and executive vice president in 2000. She was named the president and CEO of the company in March 2002, succeeding Ronald A. Millett. At the time Deseret Book consisted of a retail chain of some 40 stores and a publishing division. \"Bloomberg Businessweek\" reported in 2012 that Deseret Book was a \"flailing\" business when Dew took it over but that she \"pulled the publisher and distributor out of the red 10 years ago.\"\n\nIn 2002 the company launched its Time Out for Women event series, and in 2004 it acquired Excel Entertainment, which brought Deseret Book into film distribution. Some of Excel's films include \"Saints and Soldiers, Forever Strong, The Work and the Glory, 17 Miracles and .\"\n\nIn 2006, Deseret Book acquired the Seagull retail chain of twenty-six bookstores and Covenant Publishing, which publishes and distributes books, games, and gifts.\n\nIn June 2011, the company introduced Deseret Bookshelf, a free e-reader application for Apple and Android mobile devices, with nearly 1,500 digital titles for purchase. On a personal level, Dew noted that the Bookshelf app had \"changed the way I research and study the gospel\" because \"I can always have my full library with me.\" The app allows the researcher to search all Deseret Book titles at one time as well as other associated Gospel references.\n\nDew is a director of the Bonneville International Corporation, a broadcasting organization owned by the LDS Church.\n\nDew is a member of both the BYU Marriott School of Management’s National Advisory Council and the President’s Leadership Council for BYU-Hawaii. In March 2003, the White House appointed her a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Commission on the Status of Women and Girls at the United Nations.\n\nAfter a 1999 trip to Ghana, Dew began to spearhead Chapters of Hope, a program to send children’s books to impoverished areas of the world. Through 2011, nearly 50,000 books had been shipped to Ghana, the Pacific Islands, Russia, Eastern Europe, Zimbabwe and elsewhere by that organization.\n\nDew has said she has a greater liking for Republican political positions, particularly on social issues, explaining that \"I am a Midwestern farmer's daughter,\" but that she has \"many, many times\" voted for Democrats. She has been asked to run for political office, but said she is so shy she \"can't even ask for the full can of apple juice on the airplane\" so she couldn't very well ask for votes.\n\nDew opened the 2004 Republican National Convention with a prayer after, she said, she had received a telephone request from \"out of the blue and after she \"had to ask myself if this would appear too partisan, and I decided it was never inappropriate to pray.\" She said she thought it \"remarkable\" that an LDS Church member was invited for the honor, \"and even more so a woman.\"\n\nDew was a counselor to Mary Ellen W. Smoot in the general presidency of the women’s Relief Society from 1997 to 2002, the first unmarried woman called to this position.\n\nAs an author, Dew was the authorized biographer for three church presidents: Ezra Taft Benson, Gordon B. Hinckley, and Russell M. Nelson.\n\nSince 2009, Dew has contributed to the Mormon Channel's \"Conversations\" program, where she has interviewed some high-profile members of the LDS Church.\n\nIn 2006, Dew was diagnosed with breast cancer, revealed as \"three tiny spots, almost invisible to the naked eye,\" and since 2010 she has been active in promoting awareness of the disease among Utah women. \"I'm actually a poster child for early diagnosis,\" Dew said.\n\nDew \"drew criticism\" resulting from remarks she made on February 28, 2004, at a Washington, D.C., meeting of the Family Action Council International, an interfaith group. According to Lee Davidson, a \"Deseret News\" reporter who was present, Dew quoted a statement by journalist Dorothy Thompson in 1941:\n\nsaying that before World War II would be over, every person would either stand for or against [German dictator Adolf] Hitler—and that trying not to make any choice was in fact making one, for Hitler.<br>\n\nDew said in calm tones that the same is true in the fight for the traditional family, and everyone will support or fight it. \"If we do not act in behalf of the family, that is itself an act of opposition to the family,\" she said.<br>\n\nDew did add, \"At first it may be extreme to imply a comparison between the atrocities of Hitler and what is happening in terms of contemporary threats against the family—but maybe not,\" and added she feels that breaking up the family will break up society.\n\nThe next month the organization, which is not officially affiliated with the LDS Church, issued a statement expressing “outrage” at Dew's remarks, and in September of the same year the president of the Human Rights Campaign and the strategic director of the National Black Justice Coalition called on President George W. Bush to repudiate Dew's “deeply offensive comments about GLBT Americans.”\n\nIn April 2005, Dew said that her point had nothing to do with Hitler. “I wasn't comparing anybody to Hitler,” she said. “Hitler is irrelevant to the point I was trying to make.”\n\n“I have friends living an openly gay lifestyle with kids,” she added. “In every instance, they are caring parents who love their kids and their kids love them. They know I feel it's not my prerogative to judge them. It's their right to choose. ... Those that deal with same-sex attraction have my respect.”\n\n\nShe has authored several books, including the biographies of three LDS Church presidents (Benson, Hinckley, and Nelson). She also has written a biography of the 1985 Miss America, Sharlene Wells. All of Dew's works have been published in Salt Lake City by Deseret Book.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2196805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196805", "title": "Withholding tax", "text": "Withholding tax\n\nA withholding tax, or a retention tax, is an income tax to be paid to the government by the payer of the income rather than by the recipient of the income. The tax is thus withheld or deducted from the income due to the recipient. In most jurisdictions, withholding tax applies to employment income. Many jurisdictions also require withholding tax on payments of interest or dividends. In most jurisdictions, there are additional withholding tax obligations if the recipient of the income is resident in a different jurisdiction, and in those circumstances withholding tax sometimes applies to royalties, rent or even the sale of real estate. Governments use withholding tax as a means to combat tax evasion, and sometimes impose additional withholding tax requirements if the recipient has been delinquent in filing tax returns, or in industries where tax evasion is perceived to be common.\n\nTypically the withholding tax is treated as a payment on account of the recipient's final tax liability, when the withholding is made in advance. It may be refunded if it is determined, when a tax return is filed, that the recipient's tax liability to the government which received the withholding tax is less than the tax withheld, or additional tax may be due if it is determined that the recipient's tax liability is more than the withholding tax. In some cases the withholding tax is treated as discharging the recipient's tax liability, and no tax return or additional tax is required. Such withholding is known as final withholding. \n\nThe amount of withholding tax on income payments other than employment income is usually a fixed percentage. In the case of employment income the amount of withholding tax is often based on an estimate of the employee's final tax liability, determined either by the employee or by the government.\n\nSome governments have written laws which require taxes to be paid before the money can be spent for any other purpose. This ensures the taxes will be paid first and will be paid on time, rather than risk the possibility that the tax-payer might default at the time when tax falls due in arrears.\n\nTypically, withholding is required to be done by the employer of someone else, taking the tax payment funds out of the employee or contractor's salary or wages. The withheld taxes are then paid by the employer to the government body that requires payment, and applied to the account of the employee, if applicable. The employee may also be required by the government to file a tax return self-assessing one's tax and reporting withheld payments.\n\nMost developed countries operate a wage withholding tax system. In some countries, subnational governments require wage withholding so that both national and subnational taxes may be withheld. In the U.S., Canada, and others, the federal and most state or provincial governments, as well as some local governments, require such withholding for income taxes on payments by employers to employees. Income tax for the individual for the year is generally determined upon filing a tax return after the end of the year.\n\nThe amount withheld and paid by the employer to the government is applied as a prepayment of income taxes and is refundable if it exceeds the income tax liability determined on filing the tax return. In such systems, the employee generally must make a representation to the employer regarding factors that would influence the amount withheld. Generally, the tax authorities publish guidelines for employers to use in determining the amount of income tax to withhold from wages.\n\nThe United Kingdom and certain other jurisdictions operate a withholding tax system known as pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), although the term \"withholding tax\" is not commonly used in the UK. Unlike many other withholding tax systems, PAYE systems generally aim to collect all of an employee's tax liability through the withholding tax system, making an end of year tax return redundant. However, taxpayers with more complicated tax affairs must file tax returns.\n\nAustralia operates a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system, which is similar to PAYE. The system applies only at the federal level, as the individual states do not collect income taxes.\n\nSome systems require that income taxes be withheld from certain payments other than wages made to domestic persons. Ireland requires withholding of tax on payments of interest on deposits by banks and building societies to individuals. The U.S. requires payers of dividends, interest, and other \"reportable payments\" to individuals to withhold tax on such payments in certain circumstances. Australia requires payers of interest, dividends and other payments to withhold an amount when the payee does not provide a tax file number or Australian Business Number to the payer. India enforces withholding tax also on payments between companies and not just from companies to individuals, under the TDS system. (Since April 2016, the United Kingdom has discontinued withholding tax on interest and dividends, though in some cases this income will become liable for taxation through other means). Rwanda charges withholding tax on business payments unless the paying company obtains proof that the recipient is registered with the tax administration and that they have a recent income tax declaration.\n\nMany countries (and/or subdivisions thereof) have social insurance systems that require payment of taxes for retirement annuities and medical coverage for retirees. Most such systems require that employers pay a tax to cover such benefits. Some systems also require that employees pay such taxes.\n\nWhere the employees are required to pay the tax, it is generally withheld from the payment of wages and paid by the employer to the government. Social insurance tax rates may be different for employers than for employees. Most systems provide an upper limit on the amount of wages subject to social insurance taxes.\n\nMost countries require payers of interest, dividends and royalties to non-resident payees (generally, if a non-domestic postal address is in the payers records) withhold from such payment an amount at a specific rate. Payments of rent may also be subject to withholding tax or may be taxed as business income. The amounts may vary by type of income. A few jurisdictions treat fees paid for technical consulting services as royalties subject to withholding of tax. Income tax treaties may reduce the amount of tax for particular types of income paid from one country to residents of the other country.\n\nSome countries require withholding by the purchaser of real property. The U.S. also imposes a 10% withholding tax on the gross sales price of a U.S. real property interest unless advance IRS approval is obtained for a lower rate. Canada imposes similar rules for 25% withholding, and withholding on sale of business real property is 50% of the price, but may be reduced on application.\n\nThe European Union has issued directives prohibiting taxation on companies by one member state of dividends from subsidiaries in other member state, except in some cases, interest on debt obligations, or royalties received by a resident of another member nation.\n\nProcedures vary for obtaining reduced withholding tax under income tax treaties. Procedures for recovery of excess amounts withheld vary by jurisdiction. In some, recovery is made by filing a tax return for the year in which the income was received. Time limits for recovery vary greatly.\n\nTaxes withheld may be eligible for a foreign tax credit in the payee's home country.\n\nMost withholding tax systems require withheld taxes to be remitted to tax authorities within specified time limits, which time limits may vary with the withheld amount. Remittance by electronic funds transfer may be required or preferred.\nPenalties for delay or failure to remit withheld taxes to tax authorities can be severe. The sums withheld by a business is regarded as a debt to the tax authority, so that on bankruptcy of the business the tax authority stands as an unsecured creditor; however, sometimes the tax authority has legislative priority over other creditors.\n\nNearly all systems imposing withholding tax requirements also require reporting of amounts withheld in a specified manner. Copies of such reporting are usually required to be provided to both the person on whom the tax is imposed and to the levying government. Reporting is generally required annually for amounts withheld with respect to wages. Reporting requirements for other payments vary, with some jurisdictions requiring annual reporting and others requiring reporting within a specified period after the withholding occurs.\n\n\n"}

Released in 1982, the song hit #6 for two weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in May 1982. It spent 20 weeks on the chart, and on the \"Billboard\" Year-End Hot 100 chart, it placed at #39, and on \"Cashbox's\" chart at #60.\n\nThis song marked Davis's second single release upon his departure from Bang Records to Arista, the first being \"Cool Night\". The style of \"'65 Love Affair\" was reminiscent of such blue-eyed soul groups as Hall & Oates, a vein that Davis had not explored before. Davis had originally titled the song \"'55 Love Affair\", but Arista felt that some modernization was needed to target an audience whose teenage years had occurred in the 1960s, including Davis himself. As Arista pointed out, Davis was only 7 years old in 1955, too young for any meaningful \"love affair\", but was 17 years old in 1965, perfect for the song.\n\nDavis's previous hits had been country-oriented or ballads. The format change to pop proved to be quite marketable. \"'65 Love Affair\" and \"Cool Night\", which were recorded at the same time, ranked first and third in terms of his Hot 100 peaks (\"I Go Crazy\" ranked second). In spite of this popular success, Davis was so disgusted with the commercialized result that he opted out of his contract with Arista and signed with Razor & Tie Record Company, a label on which Davis never charted on the Hot 100.\n\nThe music video is composed entirely of news archives from the year 1965, including footage of then US President Lyndon Johnson, the Vietnam War, and the Watts riots.\n"}
{"id": "2196827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196827", "title": "GABAB receptor", "text": "GABAB receptor\n\nGABA receptors (GABAR) are metabotropic transmembrane receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that are linked via G-proteins to potassium channels. The changing potassium concentrations hyperpolarize the cell at the end of an action potential. The reversal potential of the GABA-mediated IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential) is –100 mV, which is much more hyperpolarized than the GABA IPSP. GABA receptors are found in the central nervous system and the autonomic division of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nThe receptors were first named in 1981 when their distribution in the CNS was determined, which was determined by Norman Bowery and his team using radioactively labelled baclofen.\n\nThey can stimulate the opening of K channels which brings the neuron closer to the equilibrium potential of K. This reduces the frequency of action potentials which reduces neurotransmitter release. Thus GABA receptors are inhibitory receptors.\n\nGABA receptors also reduces the activity of adenylyl cyclase and Ca channels by using G-proteins with G/G α subunits.\n\nGABA receptors are involved in behavioral actions of ethanol, gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and possibly in pain. Recent research suggests that these receptors may play an important developmental role.\n\nGABA Receptors are similar in structure to and in the same receptor family with metabotropic glutamate receptors. There are two subunits of the receptor, GABA and GABA, and these appear to assemble as heterodimers in neuronal membranes by linking up by their intracellular C termini. In the mammalian brain, two predominant, differentially expressed isoforms of the GABA are transcribed from the Gabbr1 gene, GABA and GABAB, which are conserved in different species including humans. This might potentially offer more complexity in terms of the function due to different composition of the receptor. \n\nIt is speculated that binding of GABA causes the subunits to swing shut around the agonist like a venus fly trap.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2196828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196828", "title": "Rehabilitation Project Force", "text": "Rehabilitation Project Force\n\nThe Rehabilitation Project Force, or RPF, is the Church of Scientology's program for members of its Sea Organization who have allegedly violated expectations or policies. This may include members who are deemed to have hidden evil intentions towards Scientology, members who are unproductive in their work or who produce poor-quality work.\n\nThe program includes manual labor tasks and the study of L. Ron Hubbard's works. The rehabilitation program may take more than a year to complete, and the Church has been accused of overworking and mistreating its participants. Critics have characterized the RPF as a forced labor and re-indoctrination program comparable to the Soviet gulag system.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Project Force developed out of a predecessor group, the Mud Box Brigade, which was formed aboard L. Ron Hubbard's private fleet in the late 1960s. The mud box is a small perforated screening box fitted to the suction pipe in the bilge of a ship, and is designed to catch larger solid waste before it can choke the pipeline and potentially damage the pump. The Mud Box Brigade was assigned to clean out the mud box as well as fuel lines, water hues, bilges and other parts of the fleet's ships.\n\nHubbard defined the role as being essentially a punishment duty for unsatisfactory workers: \"More candidates will be appointed regularly and promptly every time I find a freeloader who is loafing on post and drifting with the wind.\" Hubbard later clarified that \"(T)his group is the most downstat [unproductive] and one gets assigned to it by being a freeloader, invisible on post, loafing and really goofing up on one's job.\" Religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, however, suggested that \"Hubbard understood it in terms of making retribution to the people who had been harmed by the nonperformance or incorrect performance of one's assigned tasks.\"\n\nIn 1969, Hubbard replaced the Mud Box Brigade with the Rehabilitation Unit, again intended for those removed or disciplined \"as ineffective or trouble.\" Following an evaluation, the individual was to receive a set of \"specific recommendations which if followed will rehabilitate the individual as a highly effective and worthwhile Sea Org member.\" Hubbard instructed that \"(T)he unit is [to be] worked hard during the day on a rigorous schedule on jobs assigned by the Review Chief handling corrective areas and jobs needing remedy and repair. The Unit itself is thus made into an effective ship's review team. It works on a one job, one time, one place formula completing each job before moving into the next. Each individual thus earns the right to the remedial services he or she will receive.\"\n\nFinally, the Rehabilitation Unit was replaced in January 1974 with the Rehabilitation Project Force, or RPF. According to Hubbard, \"the RPF has been created by the Commodore [Hubbard] so that redemption can occur. That is basically its only purpose.\" He identified four categories of people who were to be assigned to the RPF: \"rockslammers\" (people deemed to have hidden evil intentions, as detected by the E-meter); people who were unproductive and scored poorly on the Oxford Capacity Analysis personality test; \"repeated stat crashers\", people who were held responsible for declines in Scientology organizations' productivity; and \"overt product makers\", people who produced poor-quality work. As before, the unit was to work on \"one job, one place, one time.\" A five-hour study period was to be implemented each day to improve the individuals' knowledge of Scientology. According to David G. Bromley and Douglas E. Cowan, the RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep.\n\nThe RPF was originally intended to last no more than a couple of months, where the assignee would learn Scientology auditing, if he or she was not already an auditor, by the \"read it, drill it, do it\" method. RPF members would then co-audit each other to better themselves and make each other more ethical and productive.\n\nAs punishment, RPF members are often made to wear black boiler suits.\n\nCritics of Scientology, including former Scientologists, have compared the RPF with the gulag system of the Soviet Union. Leaving the Sea Org, even from the RPF, results in what Scientology calls \"freeloader debt\" or a \"freeloader's bill\": retroactive billing for any auditing received or any Scientology training received while in the Sea Org, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars. While this \"freeloader debt\" is not legally binding, many former Scientologists have reported that they felt trapped by the \"freeloader debt\" policy.\n\nIn his book \"\", ex-Scientologist John Duignan describes RPF members living in a rat-infested basement, engaging in degrading jobs for years at a stretch, while denied visits with spouses or children.\n\nDouglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley state that various scholars and observers have come to radically different conclusions about the RPF and whether it is \"voluntary or coercive, therapeutic or punitive\".\n\nOne location, known as the Castile Canyon School or \"Happy Valley\", has been identified as a former RPF facility. It was located east of San Jacinto, California and southeast of Gold Base, near the reservation of the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians. This site was sold by the Church in 2002 to the Soboba Band, who turned it into a resort.\n\n"}

He was subsequently named Big 12 Player of the Year and earned an Honorable Mention All-America by the Associated Press. By the end of the 2003–04 season, Allen had become the first player in Cowboys history to surpass the 1,000 career point threshold in only two seasons.\n\nAllen was drafted by the Boston Celtics in the first round (25th overall) of the 2004 NBA draft on June 24, 2004, and signed a multi-year contract with the Celtics on July 3, 2004. As a rookie in the 2004–05 season, he averaged 6.4 points, 2.9 rebounds and 0.99 steals in 16.4 minutes over 77 games (34 starts).

On January 7, 2007, Allen recorded 21 points, 9 rebounds, and 7 steals in a road loss to the Orlando Magic. In a contest against the Indiana Pacers on January 10, 2007, Allen suffered a season-ending tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) of his left knee; Allen hurt the knee when he landed awkwardly after an uncontested dunk attempt, that came after the whistle, in the final minutes of the 97–84 loss. In his third season, Allen averaged career-highs of 11.5 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 1.5 steals per game.\n\nAllen recovered in time for the start of the 2007–08 season. In his first game coming out off the injury, Allen scored 4 points and grabbed 5 rebounds during a victory over the visiting Washington Wizards. In his first double-digit scoring output since the injury, Allen recorded 13 points in a win over the New Jersey Nets on November 14. He scored a season-high 20 points in a home game win versus the Memphis Grizzlies. Almost four weeks later, Allen tied his season high during a road victory over the Miami Heat. Allen scored 18 points to go along with 4 rebounds on February 20, during a road loss to the Golden State Warriors. At the end of the regular season, he averaged 6.6 points, 2.2 rebounds, and 1.5 assists in 18.3 minutes over 75 games (11 starts). He substantially contributed to the Celtics' successful playoff run that led to an NBA Finals berth, where they claimed the 2008 NBA Championship after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.\n\nIn July 2008, Allen re-signed with the Celtics after agreeing to a two-year guaranteed deal paying $2.5 million each year. Allen went on to average 7.8 points, 2.3 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.17 steals in 19.3 minutes in 46 games (two starts) in his fifth season with the Celtics.\n\nAllen played a pivotal defensive role for the Eastern Conference champion Celtics during the 2009–10 season, averaging 6.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, 1.3 assists, and 1.07 steals in 16.5 minutes in 77 games (eight starts).

The Celtics reached the 2010 NBA Finals, where they were defeated 4–3 by the Lakers.\n\nOn July 13, 2010, Allen signed a three-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies, reportedly worth $9.7 million. Two weeks after signing with the Grizzlies, Allen revealed he felt 'overshadowed' in Boston by teammates Paul Pierce and Ray Allen.\n\nAllen emerged as one of the league's premier perimeter defenders in his first season with Memphis, averaging 1.79 steals as well as helping the Grizzlies pace the NBA in steals and forced turnovers. Allen was subsequently named to the 2010–11 NBA All-Defensive Second Team, marking his first and the Grizzlies' first selection to an All-Defensive Team, and finished fourth in the voting for Defensive Player of the Year. He averaged 4.14 steals per 48 minutes, the highest rate by an NBA player since Nate McMillan in 1993–94. Allen averaged 8.9 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.4 assists on .510 shooting in 20.8 minutes in 72 games (31 starts).

He was subsequently named to the 2011–12 NBA All-Defensive First Team after placing fifth in the NBA in steals per game (career-high 1.79) and third in steals per 48 minutes (3.27). He also finished sixth in voting for the 2011–12 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, the highest for any guard. In January 2012, he was voted the best perimeter defender in the NBA by the league's general managers.\n\nIn 2012–13, Allen led all players receiving votes for the NBA All-Defensive teams, marking his second-straight First Team All-Defense honor and third consecutive NBA All-Defense selection. He finished fifth in balloting for 2012–13 Defensive Player of the Year after averaging a career-high 4.6 rebounds and 1.51 steals in 26.7 minutes in a career-high 79 games (all starts). During the 2013 playoffs, Allen averaged playoff career highs across the board with 10.3 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 2 steals in 28.1 minutes in 15 postseason games, thus helping Memphis advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history.\n\nOn July 15, 2013, Allen re-signed with the Grizzlies on a four-year contract worth $20 million. Allen concluded his fourth season in Memphis and 10th in the NBA with averages of 9 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.64 steals on .494 shooting in 23.2 minutes in 55 games (28 starts). He missed 27 games due to injury, illness, or league suspension.\n\nThe Grizzlies entered the playoffs as the seventh seed and faced the Oklahoma City Thunder. Allen recorded 10 offensive rebounds in Game 4 against the Thunder, becoming the sixth reserve to record 10+ offensive rebounds in a postseason game since the 1986 Playoffs, joining centers John Salley, Roy Tarpley, Jayson Williams, Greg Ostertag and Jeff Foster. He finished Game 4 with 14 points and 13 rebounds, becoming the second Grizzlies reserve to register a double‐double in a playoff game, joining Lorenzen Wright (10 points, 10 rebounds on April 29, 2006). The Grizzlies were ultimately eliminated by the Thunder in seven games.\n\nIn 2014–15, Allen continued to be a defensive stalwart while guarding the opposing team's best offensive talent. He made his third NBA All-Defensive First Team (and fourth career All-Defense accolade) after ranking fourth in the league in steals (2 pg) while playing 26.2 minutes per game. Allen was the only player in 2014–15 to record at least three games with six-or-more steals.\n\nIn May 2016, Allen was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the 2015–16 season, marking the fifth career All-Defensive selection for Allen in six seasons with the Grizzlies. Allen averaged 8.4 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.72 steals in 25.3 minutes in 64 games (57 starts) for Memphis in 2015–16. He was tied for the NBA lead with Minnesota's Ricky Rubio in steals per 48 minutes (3.3) among players with a minimum of 1,500 total minutes played. The Grizzlies' defensive rating was 2.2 points better with Allen on the floor (104.1) than with him off the floor (106.3). In addition, Allen led the team with 1.7 steals per game.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, Allen was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team for the 2016–17 season, marking the sixth career All-Defensive selection for Allen, having now been recognized on the NBA All-Defensive Teams six times in his seven seasons with the Grizzlies. Allen appeared in 71 games (66 starts) for Memphis in 2016–17, averaging 9.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.4 assists and a team-leading 1.62 steals in 27 minutes per game. He led the league in steal percentage (3.1), his second time to lead the league in the category (4.1 in 2014–15).\n\nOn October 12, 2017, the Grizzlies announced they will retire Allen's No. 9 jersey when he retires.\n\nOn September 15, 2017, Allen signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. On November 1, 2017, he had a season-high 10 points in 19 minutes off the bench in a 104–98 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. On December 10, 2017 against the Philadelphia 76ers, Allen suffered a fractured left fibula. He was nearing a return in mid-January, but on January 15, he was sidelined for another two to four weeks after suffering a setback during his recovery.\n\nOn February 1, 2018, Allen was traded, along with Ömer Aşık, Jameer Nelson and a protected first-round pick, to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Nikola Mirotić and a 2018 second-round pick. In addition, Chicago will have the right to swap its 2021 second-round pick with New Orleans' own 2021 second-round pick. Allen was waived by the Bulls eight days later before appearing in a game for them.\n\nStanding at 6 feet 4 inches tall (1.93 m) and weighing 213 pounds (97 kg), Allen plays both the shooting guard and small forward positions. Allen is known as an elite, all-purpose defender and is often assigned to defend high-scoring swingman, making it uncomfortable for players to score against him. Allen has been named in the NBA All-Defensive Team six out of seven times from to .\n\nOn February 26, 2016, in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Kobe Bryant presented Allen with an autographed pair of shoes that read \"To Tony, the best defender I ever faced!\" Both players were inactive for the game.\n\nAs a Boston Celtic, Allen was donned the nickname \"Gucci\" by his teammates. With the Grizzlies, he earned the nickname \"Grindfather\".\n\nAllen is the son of Ella Allen. He has two sisters, Ebony and Dominique, and a brother, Ryan, who played on the Grizzlies' 2012 summer league squad following a four-year collegiate career at Wisconsin-Milwaukee.\n\nIn November 2005, Allen was indicted on three counts of aggravated battery following a fight which led to a shooting in August 2005 in Chicago. He was found not guilty at trial in April 2007.\n"}

Allen was the drummer and musical director of Fela Kuti's band Africa '70 from 1968 to 1979, and was one of the primary co-founders of the genre of Afrobeat music. Fela once stated that, \"without Tony Allen, there would be no Afrobeat.\" He was described by Brian Eno as \"perhaps the greatest drummer who has ever lived.\" \n\nAllen's career and life story were documented in his 2013 autobiography \"Tony Allen: Master Drummer of Afrobeat\", co-written with author/musician Michael E. Veal, who previously wrote a comprehensive biography of Fela Kuti.\n\nAllen was born in Lagos, Nigeria. He began playing drums at the age of 18, while working as an engineer for a radio station. Allen was influenced by music his father listened to Jùjú, a popular Yoruba music from the 1940s, but also American jazz, and the growing highlife scene in Nigeria and Ghana. Allen worked hard to develop a unique voice on the drums, feverishly studying LPs and magazine articles by Max Roach and Art Blakey, but also revolutionary Ghanaian drummer Guy Warren (later known as Kofi Ghanaba – who developed a highly sought-after sound that mixed tribal Ghanaian drumming with bop – working with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, and Max Roach).\n\nAllen was hired by \"Sir\" Victor Olaiya to play claves with his highlife band, the Cool Cats. Allen was able to fill the drum set chair when the former Cool Cats drummer left the band. Allen later played with Agu Norris and the Heatwaves, the Nigerian Messengers, and the Melody Makers.\n\nIn 1964, Fela Kuti invited Allen to audition for a jazz-highlife band he was forming. Kuti and Allen had played together as sidemen in the Lagos circuit. Fela complimented Allen's unique sound: \"How come you are the only guy in Nigeria who plays like this – jazz and highlife?\" Thus Allen became an original member of Kuti's \"Koola Lobitos\" highlife-jazz band.\n\nIn 1969, following a turbulent and educational trip to the United States, Allen served as the musical director of Fela's band, Africa '70, which developed a new militant African sound, mixing the heavy groove and universal appeal of soul with jazz, highlife, and the polyrhythmic template of Yoruba conventions. Allen developed a novel style to complement Fela's new African groove that blended these disparate genres.\n\nAllen recounted how he and Fela wrote in 1970: \"Fela used to write out the parts for all the musicians in the band (Africa '70). I was the only one who originated the music I played. Fela would ask what type of rhythm I wanted to play.… You can tell a good drummer because we… have four limbs… and they are… playing different things… the patterns don't just come from Yoruba… [but] other parts of Nigeria and Africa.\"\n\nAllen recorded more than 30 albums with Fela and Africa '70. But by the late 1970s, dissension was growing in the ranks of Africa '70. Arguments over royalties/pay and recognition grew in intensity. As inventor of the rhythms that underpinned Afrobeat and musical director, Allen felt especially slighted. Fela stood his ground, stating that he would get the royalties for his songs. Fela did support Allen's three solo recordings: \"Jealousy\" ('75), \"Progress\" ('77), \"No Accommodation For Lagos\" ('79), but by 1979, Allen chose to leave Africa '70, taking many members with him. \"'What makes me decide it's time to go? It's … everything...and (his) carelessness...like he doesn't care, like he doesn't know ...he doesn't feel he's done anything (wrong). And with all the parasites around too... there were 71 people on tour by now and only 30 working in the band...you got to ask why. Those guys were sapping Fela of his Force, of his Music.' So Tony moved on, once again in search of his own sound.\"\n\nAllen formed his own group, recording \"No Discrimination\" in 1980, and performing in Lagos until emigrating to London in 1984. Later moving to Paris, Allen recorded with King Sunny Adé, Ray Lema and Manu Dibango. Allen recorded \"N.E.P.A.\" in 1985.\n\nPost-Fela, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing and fusing Afrobeat with electronica, dub, R&B, and rap. Allen refers to this synthesis as \"afrofunk\".\n\nAllen returned with a much anticipated new project for his 13th release. Recorded live in Lagos, with a full-sized Afrobeat band, \"Lagos No Shaking\" (Lagos is OK) signified Allen's return to roots Afrobeat after forays into avant-garde electronica hybrids. \"Lagos No Shaking\" was released on 13 June 2006.\n\nIn 2002, Allen appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album \"Red Hot and Riot\" in tribute to Fela Kuti. Allen appeared alongside Res, Ray Lema, Baaba Maal, Positive Black Soul and Archie Shepp on a track entitled \"No Agreement.\"\n\nAllen played drums throughout the 2003 album \"Love Trap\" by Susheela Raman and also performed with her live.\n\nIn 2004 Allen recorded with French electronic artist Sébastien Tellier on the album \"Politics\" including the hit song \"La Ritournelle\".\n\nIn 2006 Allen recorded the album \"trippin\" with the Amsterdam based New Cool Collective Mixing his Afrobeat with jazz and did a series of concerts in the Netherlands, among then the Lowlands Festival.\n\nIn 2006, Allen joined with Damon Albarn, Paul Simonon, and Simon Tong as drummer for The Good, the Bad & the Queen.\n\nAllen played drums on two tracks on the 2007 album \"5:55\" by Charlotte Gainsbourg: \"5:55\" and \"Night-Time Intermission\", backed by French duo Air and Jarvis Cocker of Pulp.\n\nHe also made an appearance playing the drums in the video for \"Once Upon a Time\" by French duo Air in late 2007.\n\nHe was a featured artist on Zap Mama's albums \"Supermoon\" (2007) and \"ReCreation\" (2009), adding his voice to the tracks \"1000 Ways\" and \"African Diamond.\"\nAllen also contributed drums on \"People Dansa\", an afrobeat rhythm-fuelled track on the second album of the Brazilian singer Flavia Coelho, released in 2014.\n\nHis album entitled \"Secret Agent\" was released in June 2009 by World Circuit.\n\nAllen has influenced a range of artists across a number of genres. In the single \"Music Is My Radar\" (2000) Blur pay homage to him, and the song ends with Damon Albarn repeating the phrase \"Tony Allen got me dancing.\"\n\nAllen collaborated with Albarn and Flea in a project called Rocket Juice and The Moon with an album released in 2012. Albarn collaborated with him again for the single \"Go Back\" in 2014, that is part of the album \"Film of Life\", released in October. \n\nAllen replaced Vladislav Delay as drummer for the Moritz Von Oswald Trio and appeared on their album \"Sounding Lines\".\n\nIn 2017, he released \"A Tribute to Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers\", a four-song EP on Blue Note Records featuring a reworked Afrobeat version of Art Blakey's \"Moanin'\".\n\nIn 2017, Allen collaborated with Malian singer Oumou Sangaré for the track \"Yere faga\" from her album \"Mogoya\".\n\nIn 2018, Allen recorded E.P. \"Tomorrow Comes The Harvest\" with Techno DJ Jeff Mills.\n\nIn 2019, filmmaker Opiyo Okeyo released the documentary film \"Birth of Afrobeat\" about Allen's life in music. The film screened at American Black Film Festival and won the 21st Century Fox Global Inclusion Award for Emerging Voices at the BlackStar Film Festival. \"Birth of Afrobeat\" was acquired by American Public Television and had its television premiere January 20, 2020 on PBS. \n\nIn 2020, Allen featured on the Gorillaz track \"How Far?\" alongside Skepta, as part of the band's Song Machine series.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, Allen died of abdominal aortic aneurysm at Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris. Tributes came from musicians and producers including Flea, Peter Gabriel, Jeff Mills, Nigel Godrich, Sean Lennon, and Damon Albarn.\n\n"}

{"id": "2196857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196857", "title": "Navarre, Florida", "text": "Navarre, Florida\n\nNavarre is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in Santa Rosa County in the northwest Florida Panhandle. It is a major bedroom community for mostly U.S. military personnel, federal civil servants, local population, retirees and defense contractors. Due to Navarre Beach and the four miles of beach front on the Gulf of Mexico thereof, as well as several miles of beaches within the Navarre Beach Marine Park and the Gulf Islands National Seashore, it has a small, but rapidly growing community of nature enthusiasts and tourists. Navarre has quickly grown from being a small town of around 1,500 in 1970 to a town with a population of 44,876, estimate.\n\nNavarre is about east of Pensacola and about west of Fort Walton Beach. The community is roughly centered on the junction of U.S. Route 98 and State Road 87. It is part of the Pensacola–Ferry Pass–Brent Metropolitan Statistical Area (more commonly referred to as the Pensacola Metro Area), and is the second largest community in the metropolitan area, according to a 2014 study.\n\nNavarre is also part of the Fort Walton Beach-Navarre-Wright Urbanized Area. It is known for the natural environment, swimming, picnic spots, and its beach.\n\nIn 1693 Spanish explorers Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora and Admiral Andrés de Pez y Malzárraga set sail from Veracruz. A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician and theologian, Sigüenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in Northwest Florida during the expedition. While traveling in the area of East Bay in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the East Bay River. In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sigüenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \"The River Jordan\".\n\nOn April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \"El Robledal,\" meaning \"The Oakgrove\" in Spanish. After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez-Sigüenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andrés de Arriola y Guzmán (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the Tristán de Luna y Arellano colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.\n\nRobledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a homestead by the Axelson Family. Their home was along the shore of the East Bay, on a small cape, in which, they are now the namesake, after the point was officially designated, Axelson Point.\n\nSoon after their settlement in what would become Navarre, they established a shipyard on Axelson Point, jutting into what was also then called, Axelson Cove. The shipyard was considered to be mostly successful, as the family made a business of fixing ships in port in the nearby deep-water port in Pensacola and the river port in Milton, as well as building large-scale ships of their own.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, despite the political ideology of citizens in the local area, records make it seem as though the Axelson's were pro-union. This is substantiated by record showing that, while many businesses in the area were becoming ruined due to the Union blockade of southern ports, the Axelson's shipyard was quite busy and prosperous, primarily from business completed with the Union navy and the United States Merchant Marines.\n\nIn addition, some records and books, such as the \"Atlas of Florida\", attest that, while most likely unassisted by the Axelsons, Union raids were made against Confederate troops and camps, stationed near where Gulf Breeze is today, through routes in what would become Navarre and Holley, Florida.\n\nSome maps of the area during this time, seem to indicate that the area was also known as “Bilowry,” a presumed misspelling or combination of the name, Bill Lowry. The area also had a post office under this name from 1886–1891.\n\nSome 30 years after the first homestead in the area was established, seemingly coinciding with the community of Bilowry, a small settlement named Eagan arose in 1884. The settlement, composed of approximately 40 families, was located off the Santa Rosa Sound and encompassed a portion of present-day Navarre. The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.\n\nThe founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was Guy Wyman, a colonel in the United States Army. During World War I, he met a French nurse named Noelle. At the time, immigration policies would not allow him to bring her to the United States as a fiancée or even as a wife, but he could bring her back as his legal child. Colonel Wyman therefore adopted her, and brought her back to the Florida panhandle, where he purchased a large amount of land. Noelle named their holdings \"Navarre\", after the province in Spain, near France. Wyman platted the town in 1925, but made no steps towards development. However, during the Great Depression, the Wymans could not pay the taxes on it, and were forced to begin selling it off. Part of that property is where the Navarre Park is today.\n\nIn modern times, Navarre has become one of the fastest growing communities in Florida. While protecting and enhancing the natural environment of the area; many steps have been taken to develop luxury accommodations, water activities, boutique shopping, scenic trails, schools and nature/educational opportunities.\n\nNavarre has been impacted significantly by hurricanes. Immediately preceding Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Dennis, Navarre was seeing a new strand of growth and economic advancement. This, however, quickly came to a close, as Navarre suffered horribly during the events of those hurricanes. Many planned developments decided to stop their plans until a later date, many of which, never returning. This hard mark against Navarre lingered until the mid and late 2010s.\n\nOn March 10, 2015, a UH-60, call sign MOJO 69, from the Louisiana National Guard crashed in the Santa Rosa Sound off the coast of the community of Navarre. All eleven on board were believed killed. On November 18, 2016, Leadership Santa Rosa Class 29 unveiled the Navarre Black Hawk Memorial in Navarre Park. The memorial was built to honor the men who died in the Black Hawk crash and anyone who has paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to the United States.\n\n2017 and 2018 have seen a noticeable rise in civil activism in the Navarre area, with three notable protests occurring, all within the span of 12 months.\n\nThe first protests recorded in the community occurred on June 9, 2017, after the county unilaterally changed the town's nickname and locally popular sign. The change was made without the consent of the citizens of the town and have sparked additional calls for the incorporation of the community as a municipality.\n\nIn 2018, there were protests against the Holley-Navarre Water System. The protests were over the water system's potential violations of the Florida Sunshine Law, which guarantees the rights for citizens and residents to access the meetings and public records of government agencies. The alleged violations occurred when the board of directors of the agency met for what they called a \"secret\" meeting. The board president stated these meetings were closed due to their nature of discussing legal matters between members of the board and of several attorneys and lawyers. The argument against these protests is that the water system is not a government agency, but instead a utility contracted to serve the greater Navarre area. The situation came to a close as a new, more transparent, water board has been elected by the citizens of Navarre. Some controversy still remains though, after the new water board appointed as CEO, Rob Williamson, a former Santa Rosa County commissioner that had just been voted out of his seat, all of a month before his hiring.\n\nThe third notable protests were part of the larger national school walkout to promote gun control. While small, only consisting of a few students, it is considered notable in local political circles, as Navarre is in Florida's 1st congressional district, which is often polled as being the most conservative, and arguably the most pro-gun region in the state of Florida. There has been some speculation that this signals a larger change in the ideology of this region, as the younger generation begins to reach the voting age.\n\nFor the first time since before Hurricanes Ivan and Dennis, Navarre is now not only expanding in population, but in attractions, dining establishments, and other tourist options as well. In 2017 and 2018 alone, Navarre saw the opening of several major housing and apartment complexes, a brand new hotel, a new prototype Walmart Neighborhood Store, and several new restaurants. This expansion appears to be continuing, with the announcement of a new Aldi Supermarket, Panera Bread, Chipotle, Hotel, two shopping centers, and several more undisclosed establishments, stated to open by 2021. Lucky's, a supermarket chain, and WaWa, a convenience store chain, are also considering locations in the Navarre area. \n\nAfter the failed attempt at incorporation in 2014, a new effort in incorporating has been established by a local political action committee, the Navarre Area United PAC. the PAC is collecting petition signatories to get the issue of incorporation on the ballot.\n\nNavarre is located at . It is located within a portion of the Florida Panhandle observing the Central Time Zone. Elevation is at an average of .\n\nNavarre is located on roughly of shoreline along the Gulf of Mexico. This figure however, does not include the shorelines on both sides of Santa Rosa Sound, and the Navarre's shoreline along East Bay and the East Bay River.\n\nThe community of Navarre is located on the Gulf Coastal Plain and is built on mostly flat sandy soil, though there are a few shallow hills. Navarre is primarily located on the Fairpoint Peninsula and Santa Rosa Island. Navarre is bounded geographically in the north by the East Bay River, the Yellow River, and several creeks and on the south by the Santa Rosa Sound. Holley, a mainland community commonly considered part of Navarre, is north of the Fairpoint Peninsula, across the East Bay River.\n\nAs a low-elevation community near the Gulf of Mexico, Navarre is often threatened by hurricanes. Significant damage was incurred as a result of Hurricanes Erin, Opal, Ivan and Dennis. Many homes and businesses immediately along Santa Rosa Sound (generally south of U.S. Highway 98) suffered storm surge as a result of those storms. Recoveries have been rendered by the area with the population quickly flourishing. This area of Florida is consistently listed as one of the worst places for hurricanes.\n\nNavarre Beach is the beach neighborhood of Navarre. It is on Santa Rosa Island, a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nImmediately to its east is Navarre Beach Marine Park, a former Florida state park. Immediately to its west is a portion of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, and farther west is the community of Pensacola Beach.\n\nOn March 26, 2006, a \"beach renourishment\" project was begun, restoring sand lost due to the hurricanes of 2004 and 2005. This project eventually added approximately of sand and a high berm to the Gulf side of Santa Rosa Island for the entire length of Navarre Beach. The project was completed in December 2006. Another round of beach renourishment was completed in 2016.\n\nThe entirety of Navarre Beach was closed during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak, with only residents of the beach neighborhood being allowed on that area of the island. Furtherly, It was enforced by a police check on one side of the Navarre Beach Causeway.\n\nNavarre is a large community, estimated to have 44,876 people in the community, according to several different estimates completed since 2014. If the town of Navarre was to be incorporated it would be the largest city between Pensacola and Tallahassee (based on population). This is a major increase from just 40 years ago, when the population was hovering around 1,500. The below racial characteristics of the community are from 2017 estimates.\n\n\nNavarre is centered near the junction of U.S. Highway 98, the primary east–west route between Pensacola and the Fort Walton Beach area, and State Road 87. It is located near several large military facilities: Naval Air Station Pensacola to the west; Hurlburt Field and Eglin Air Force Base to the east; and Naval Air Station Whiting Field to the North.\n\nTourism has increased in the Navarre area since 2010, being declared \"Florida's Best Kept Secret\" by the local hospitality business. Navarre has a park on the mainland next to Navarre Beach bridge and the Intracoastal Waterway that contains a visitor information center; water splash pad, duck pond, butterfly house, playground, gazebos; pier and small beach area. Boating, Surfing, jet skiing, paddle boarding, fishing, bird watching, exploring scenic trails and walking/jogging are popular among the residents and visitors. Navarre's fourth hotel became the first beachfront hotel to operate since 2004 when it opened in 2017.\n\nIn 2010 the Navarre Beach fishing pier was rebuilt after repeated damage from hurricanes. At , it is currently the longest fishing pier on the Gulf of Mexico and in the state of Florida.\n\nThe Panhandle Butterfly House on Navarre Parkway opened in 1997. Around 14,000 visitors stop by each year to see butterflies up close, learn about their life cycle, and find out how to attract butterflies to their own gardens. A highlight each year is the monarch migration; the orange and black butterflies are seen in the thousands as they travel to and from Mexico to breed. Due to miscommunication on the fault of the Santa Rosa County Commission, the Butterfly House closed its Navarre Park location for the 2019 season and is expected to reopen in 2021 in a new location in Milton, a few miles north of Navarre. \n\nNavarre Park provides a play area for children, basketball courts, picnic pavilions, and restroom facilities. The park hosts several large community events each year. Renovation plans for the improved 7-acre park include a new playground, splash pad, restrooms, parking, shade areas, pavilions and a new seawall; slated to be finished in 2021.\n\nEducation in Navarre is administrated by the Santa Rosa County District School system headquartered in Milton, Florida. The schools that serve the Navarre community are:\n\n\nThe community of Navarre has several public parks open year-round. These parks are currently owned and operated by the Santa Rosa County Department of Parks and Recreation and are open to the public. The Navarre Sports Complex and Navarre Soccer Complex, while owned and largely managed by the county, are partially operated by the Navarre Youth Sports Association.\n\nThe largest of the parks are the Navarre Beach Marine Park, Navarre Park, and the Navarre Sports Complex.\n\nTransportation infrastructure in Navarre is relatively limited and is dominated by roads, instead of public transportation or sidewalks. This has been to the chagrin of some local citizens. However, relatively little has been done to improve this within the last few years, beyond feasibility studies of possibile improvements.\nNavarre is centered on the intersection of U.S. Highway 98 (named \"Navarre Parkway\" while within the town) and Florida State Road 87 (which has no official name, though is sometimes called \"the Expressway\" by local residents). These provide the two largest connections in and out of the town. The Parkway (US 98) connects west to Pensacola, ultimately ending in Mississippi, and connects east to Destin and Fort Walton Beach, ultimately ending in Lakeland, Florida. The Expressway (FL 87) has its southern terminus in Navarre; however, it connects north to Interstate 10 and Milton, then ending at the Alabama state border.\n\nNavarre also has secondary connections through Florida State Road 399 and Santa Rosa County Road 399. Because of their matching shield numbers, the two are often confused by residents and tourists alike and are often instead referred to as \"Gulf Boulevard\" and \"East Bay Boulevard\" respectively. Gulf Boulevard, which has its northern terminus in Navarre, travels on Santa Rosa Island, ultimately going through the Opal Beach section of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Pensacola Beach, then ending in Gulf Breeze. East Bay Boulevard, which has its eastern terminus in Navarre, travels roughly parallel to East Bay and the East Bay River. It also passes by Gable Lake and passes over the Tom King Bayou, before connecting with US 98 in the neighboring community of Woodlawn Beach, Florida.\n\nDue to traffic flow issues on both the primary and secondary thoroughfares, a community access road has been proposed by citizens and county leaders alike. An inquiry into the feasibility of such a plan is being conducted by county officials. \nNavarre doesn't have a dedicated commercially-served airport. Instead it is largely served by Pensacola International Airport (about 25 miles west in Pensacola) and Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport (about 30 miles east in Valparaiso, Florida).\n\nNavarre does have one general aviation airfield, confusingly named Fort Walton Beach Airport, despite being both located and registered within Navarre, not the nearby city of Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The airfield has a single turf runway and primarily serves banner-towing aerial advertising aircraft, that fly ads along the beach.\n\nNavarre did also host an outlying airfield of NAS Whiting Field, Holley Naval Outlying Field; however, this airfield has since been converted into operations as one of the largest solar fields in the region. Currently being operated by Gulf Power, in cooperation with the United States Navy.\n\nNavarre has limited public transportation, despite some public calls for it. However, it is does receive service from Santa Rosa Transportation, which provides some on-demand accessibility service from the town.\nMost of the scenes in \"Jaws 2\" were filmed in and around Navarre and Navarre Beach \"circa\" 1977. The production of the movie \"was a boost to the local economy because local boaters, extras and stand-ins or doubles were hired. Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.\" Navarre's Holiday Inn \"Holidome\" was used as the film's headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodeled for David Brown and Roy Scheider. Universal rented 100 of the hotel's 200 rooms, spending $1 million. The Holiday Inn was destroyed in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. A new hotel was built on the same site as the Holiday Inn and was completed during the summer of 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Notably, he was elected to be a member of the club's Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter his playing career Crook went into coaching, mostly in Australia. He was serving as manager of A-League club Sydney FC in 2012, before joining the Western Sydney Wanderers football club as Assistant Manager.\n\nCrook began his football career at Tottenham Hotspur signing with the club as a schoolboy in 1976. He made his debut in 1980 against Liverpool and stayed with the North London club for another six years. He found it difficult to break into the first team, as the Tottenham midfield at the time contained Glenn Hoddle and Ossie Ardiles. He would, however, receive a UEFA Cup Medal in 1984 as an unused substitute for the final, in which Tottenham beat R.S.C. Anderlecht on penalties.\n\nIn 1986 Crook moved to Norwich City for a fee of £80,000, which would prove to be one of the best bargain buys for the club. He was at the hub of the most successful team in Norwich's history. During his eleven seasons at the club, he helped them to three top five finishes in England's top division and played in the club's UEFA Cup run in the 1993–94 season, though he missed the match in which Norwich were eliminated from the competition – against Inter Milan in the San Siro – through suspension after collecting two yellow cards in the tournament. He was a midfielder noted for his passing ability and accuracy from set-pieces. Many experts in the game believe that had Crook played for a so-called bigger club, he would have played for the full England team. In a 2001 poll for Four Four Two magazine, Crook was voted as one of the best players never to have played for England, along with his former Norwich team-mate Steve Bruce.\n\nHe was still with Norwich when they were relegated from the Premier League in 1995, ending the nine-year run of top division football which had started in the year that Crook joined them.\n\nHe famously agreed to leave Norwich to join their fierce rivals Ipswich Town F.C. at the end of the 1995–96 season, even posing for photos with his new shirt and buying his children replica kits before changing his mind and re-signing for City days later. This was due to former Norwich manager Mike Walker taking over the helm at Carrow Road following the sacking of Gary Megson and him persuading Crook to change his mind about the transfer. Crook had played under Walker for Norwich during his first spell as manager from 1992 to January 1994. Ipswich Town F.C. took it to court, with the local newspaper Evening Star carrying the headline \"Get out of Town Crook and take that man Walker with you\".\n\nIn 1997, he was signed by Eddie Thomson for Sanfrecce Hiroshima. He left the club in May 1998 and transferred to Northern Spirit FC, where he stayed until retiring as a player in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, Norwich fans voted Crook into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. In September of the same year he played at Carrow Road in the club's centenary match against Harwich & Parkeston F.C.. Crook remained a favourite with Norwich City supporters, and in 2008 he was voted in the Greatest Ever Norwich City eleven.\n\nAfter leaving Japan, Crook played for and coached Northern Spirit FC in Australia before moving on to take his first managerial post at Newcastle Jets. In his first season in the 'Hunter region', he took the Jets from second bottom to second, earning him the NSL Coach of the year award. Following his successful time in Newcastle, Crook took on the job of coaching the American Samoa national football team, a team that had never scored a goal in a competitive international fixture. In early 2004 he was then appointed assistant coach for the Australian U20s team, before joining Sydney F.C. the following November, under manager Pierre Littbarski, winning the A-League title and attending the World Club Championships in 2005. After the 04-05 season Littbarski left the club following a contract dispute, and Crook remained at the club for another six months.\n\nDuring his work in Australia, he was often linked with a possible return to Norwich, notably in the close-season of 2006, when Martin Hunter was eventually appointed as coach in place of Steve Foley. Following the departure of Peter Grant from Norwich City in October 2007, Crook was again linked with the vacant manager's position.\n\nIn January 2007 Crook accepted the assistant manager's role at Japanese second division side Avispa Fukuoka to be reunited with Littbarski, but the pair were dismissed in July 2008. He was subsequently linked with new A-League club North Queensland Fury FC, but instead was recruited for a second spell as manager at the Newcastle Jets.\nOn 21 January 2009 Crook was unveiled as first team coach for Norwich City alongside new manager and former teammate Bryan Gunn. In June 2010 he returned to Australia, signing a two-year contract as Director of Coaching for Sydney Olympic Football Club. Ian left Sydney Olympic in 2010 to take up the position of Head Coach at the New South Wales Institute of Sport.\n\nHe returned to Sydney FC in 2011, the club he helped coach to their inaugural Championship, this time working with former player Steve Corica and under former Czech International Vitezslav Lavicka. Following the departure of Vitezslav Lavicka at the end of the 2011/2012 season, Crook was appointed manager of Sydney FC on 14 May 2012.\n\nOn only 11 November of the same year, Crook announced his immediate resignation as head coach of Sydney FC, following a 3-2 defeat to archrivals, Melbourne Victory. This was on the back of a humiliating 7-2 loss to the Central Coast Mariners the previous week. He was temporarily replaced by assistant coach Steve Corica in a caretaker role, and then permanently by Frank Farina on 28 November.\n\nOn 12 June 2014, Western Sydney Wanderers appointment Crook as assistant coach. Crook served as assistant during the club's successful 2014 AFC Champions League campaign. On 25 February 2015, Crook took the helm of the team due to Tony Popovic serving his first of a two-game suspension. The away match against Kashima Antlers of Japan ended 1–3 in favour to Wanderers.\n"}

{"id": "2196889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196889", "title": "City Year", "text": "City Year\n\nCity Year is an American education nonprofit organization founded in 1988 dedicated to helping students and schools succeed. The organization partners with public schools in 29 high-need communities across the US and through international affiliates in the UK and Johannesburg, South Africa. City Year teams are made up of 18 to 24 year olds, who provide student, classroom, and whole school support, intended to help students stay in school and on track to graduate high school. City Year is a member of the AmeriCorps national service network, and is supported by the Corporation for National and Community Service, school district partnerships, and private philanthropy from corporations, foundations and individuals.\n\nCity Year was founded in 1988 by Michael Brown and Alan Khazei, then-roommates at Harvard Law School, who felt strongly that young people in service could be a powerful resource for addressing America's most pressing issues. They built City Year with the conviction that one person can make a difference. Since its inception, City Year has promoted the vision of service as a common expectation – and a real opportunity – for citizens all around the world.\n\nCity Year AmeriCorps members initially focused their efforts on community rehabilitation, beautification of neighborhoods, and developing community awareness in Boston. Over the years, the organization has expanded, opening sites in 28 cities throughout the US, and refocused its mission to help students in under-served schools reach their full potential and graduate from high school.\n\nInspired by a visit with City Year during his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton enlisted the help of Michael Brown, Alan Khazei and others to establish AmeriCorps through the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. Since then, more than 1 million AmeriCorps members have contributed upwards of 1.2 billion hours of public service. All AmeriCorps members, originally conceived as unpaid volunteers in service, are now paid a stipend by the federal government through the Corporation for National and Community Service and subsequently through a variety of matching grants, including the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award. City Year, along with thousands of other nonprofit organizations, is a member of the AmeriCorps network, a program of the Corporation for National and Community Service.\n\nIn early 2005, City Year opened its first international site in South Africa. A second international affiliate, City Year London based in London, England, followed in 2010, with City Year Birmingham and City Year Greater Manchester opening in the U.K. in 2013 and 2015, respectively.\n\nIn 2012, City Year announced its Long Term Impact (LTI) goal to dramatically increase the number of students on track to graduation, reaching the majority of off-track students in each of its communities, and expanding to cities and schools that produce two-thirds of the nation's urban dropouts. Based on national research from Johns Hopkins University and City Year's analysis of existing markets, roughly 15 to 20 percent of schools are producing the majority of the dropouts within urban school districts. This degree of concentration enables City Year AmeriCorps members to have an outsized impact on the graduation pipeline in each of their cities, while deploying to a relatively small number of schools. The goal of the strategy is to significantly increase graduation rates and college and career readiness in high-need urban schools by ensuring that 80 percent of students served by City Year reach the tenth grade on time and on track to graduate. City Year AmeriCorps members function as a \"human capital resource\" in under-resourced elementary, middle and high schools, working with off-track students and students at risk for falling off track to provide targeted academic and social-emotional interventions aimed at improving the number of high school graduates.\n\nCity Year AmeriCorps members commit to 11 months of service, leadership development and civic engagement, serving as tutors, mentors and role models in high-need schools. City Year responds to the challenges facing public education by providing Whole School, Whole Child (WSWC) services in high-need education institutions across the country. These services are rooted in using data to monitor student progress to better meet student needs, engaging in one-on-one and small group instruction in ELA and math with embedded social-emotional supports, establishing whole school activities that improve conditions for learning along with engaging families and inspiring civic engagement. City Year also provides extended-day activities: after-school programming, homework assistance, enrichment curricula and civic projects that build and serve communities.\n\nCity Year AmeriCorps members are supervised by full-time, on site City Year staff called Impact Managers and these corps members and staff become integrated into the fabric of the school community. They collaborate with the school principal and teachers to deliver holistic, data-driven interventions at the individual student, classroom and school-wide levels that help the school achieve its vision for educational excellence.\n\nCity Year also provides small group social-emotional skill building sessions, additional capacity in the classroom and classroom management support. City Year helps to close gaps in high-need schools by providing students with personalized support and additional developmental relationships while also providing schools with increased capacity to implement research-based reforms.\n\nCity Year's model is based on research indicating that students who are at greatest risk of dropping out can be identified as early as in the sixth grade. City Year AmeriCorps members make positive connections with students, encourage them to come to school every day, and provide evidence-based academic supports for students who exhibit one or more \"early warning indicators\": low attendance, poor behavior or course failure in English or math. Research shows that preventing one or more of these warning signs makes it three times more likely that a student will graduate, dramatically improving his or her lifetime trajectory.\n\nIn the 2017 – 2018 academic year, more than 3,000 City Year AmeriCorps members are serving approximately 223,000 students in 329 schools nationwide.\n\nCity Year serves in 29 cities within the United States, with two international affiliates.\n\nCity Year AmeriCorps members represent a diverse array of racial, ethnic, religious and educational backgrounds. Approximately 80% of corps members are recent college graduates, 56% are people of color, 48% are Pell Grant eligible, 42% are fluent or conversational in a second language and 25% are first generation college students.\n\nAmeriCorps members begin their service year in the summertime, undergoing several weeks of intensive training before the beginning of the school year. During this training, corps members are oriented to City Year culture and trained on how to work within schools. They are assigned to serve on a team at a particular school, where they will work for the duration of their service year.\n\nLike other AmeriCorps members, City Year corps members receive a biweekly living allowance, or modest stipend. City Year AmeriCorps also receive health insurance benefits and qualify for a post-service Segal Education Award through AmeriCorps. Additionally, City Year has local partnerships in all cities that offer benefits such as public transit passes and discounts to local businesses just for City Year AmeriCorps members.\n\nCity Year has developed a comprehensive approach to leadership development designed to ensure AmeriCorps member success at City Year, and in whatever field City Year alumni choose to enter after their year of service. City Year was founded on the belief that a year of service transforms both the community being served and the individual providing that service. City Year recognizes that the development of new skills and knowledge is crucial, but there are also some deeper questions that need to be explored in the journey of leadership development.\n\nCity Year's funding comes from a variety of sources. In 2017, 23% of the organization's operating revenue came from AmeriCorps, 54% from corporations, foundations and individual donors, and 23% from school districts and other local government grants. [1]\n\nPublic school districts partner with City Year to bring teams of AmeriCorps member to work in schools. Though it varies from district to district, schools are responsible for financing a portion of the cost of maintaining a team of City Year AmeriCorps members in service.\n\nCare Force is a part of City Year specifically created to engage corporations and their employees in high-impact volunteer events to help improve schools and communities.\n\nCare Force has helped to craft and lead volunteer experiences that have become an integral component of corporate partners' community service outreach, and inspired employees to want to serve again and again. Whether painting inspirational murals in a school hallway or transforming an unused space into a library; Care Force events physically transform the spaces where children and communities grow.\n\nSince launching in 2001, Care Force has led more than 90,000 volunteers in service projects and managed more than 600 events, and worked in over 130 communities in 10 countries over three continents.\n\nCity Year is a five-time winner of the Social Capitalist award from the Fast Company Monitor group. City Year has received positive reviews from the \"Princeton Review\" and the \"U.S. News & World Report\", and has earned four stars from the organization, Charity Navigator. City Year was also named to the Philanthropy 400, an annual ranking of America's nonprofits based on the contributions they raise from individuals, foundations, and corporations by the \"Chronicle of Philanthropy\", in 2015 and 2016.\n\nCity Year has been accused of exploiting its volunteers by demanding long hours of taxing work, while providing an inadequate stipend. The organization has also been criticized by some for accepting a sponsorship from the soft drink manufacturer PepsiCo. Because City Year Corps members are role models to many children, this partnership might encourage greater consumption of soft drinks, which some see problematic in light of the current national woes with childhood obesity.\n\nIn 2001 at a conference on civil society in Cape Town, US President Bill Clinton brought a delegation of City Year Service Leaders and staff from Boston, to meet with former President Nelson Mandela. Mandela was eager to implement a programme in South Africa that afforded young people the opportunity to serve their communities. He loved the idea of City Year and after further conversations; City Year's first international site was launched in 2005 with 110 Service Leaders in Johannesburg.\n\nCity Year brings together a diverse group of young people for a year of voluntary service and leadership development. These young people work in teams as tutors, mentors and role models to children in 10 primary schools throughout Johannesburg and Soweto. City Year South Africa works to support the growing National Youth Service movement, with a strong belief that youth service is a powerful vehicle for developing a generation of young leaders for South Africa, promoting a culture of service across all sectors of society, addressing critical development needs in schools and communities, and addressing youth unemployment.\n\nCity Year South Africa provides a rigorous year of full-time community service, leadership development and skills training to young South African volunteers (Service Leaders).\n\nSince its inception in 2005 City Year South Africa has graduated over 1,200 Service Leaders who engaged over 20,000 children through after-school programs and various other projects. In total these Service Leaders have completed over 1 million hours of service.\n\nCity Year launched in London during the 2010/11 academic year with 60 corps members working in teams across six primary schools. For the start of the 2011/12 school year City Year had 81 corps members serving across nine schools.\n\nSince the 2010 general election, City Year London has met with range of Members of Parliament, government ministers, and Prime Minister David Cameron to champion service opportunities for young people across the UK.\n\nIn 2012 City Year London was awarded a Social Action Fund grant of £300,000 by the Government's Cabinet Office, which has gone towards the expansion of City Year's service across London and the development of three new school partnerships from September 2012.\n\nAs part of their year of service, City Year London corps members benefit from a year-long leadership development programme which is delivered by the organisation's corporate sponsors every Friday. Leadership development days help corps members to develop skills and competencies to be successful in securing a job after City Year. This includes CV and interview guidance, work-shadowing, networking sessions, public speaking and presentation skills training. Each corps member is also matched with a corporate mentor. 95% of corps members who graduated from the 2011/12 City Year London programme successfully secured a place in education or employment after City Year.\n\nAn evaluation of City Year London's work in schools was conducted by the Institute for Volunteering Research in November 2012. It found that corps members were having a positive effect on the attainment, behaviour and focus of school children and that teachers valued the help and support they received from corps members in the classroom. The evaluation also highlighted a boost in confidence and the employability of City Year corps members who have completed the programme.\n\nCity Year London recruits a diverse corps to reflect the diversity of the children it works with. City Year is currently recruiting 18- to 25-year-old corps members from colleges, universities and youth centres across London and the rest of the UK. The organisation recruits a diversity of young people into the corps based on: socio-economic status, eligibility for Free School Meals, type of secondary education (e.g., public or private), educational attainment, gender and ethnicity. Approximately 60% of City Year London's current corps members are graduates while 40% are college leavers.\n\nThe Private Equity Foundation helped to bring City Year from America to London in 2010. The Chief Executive of the Private Equity Foundation, Shaks Ghosh visited City Year in Boston in 2009 and was so impressed by its 'double benefit' model that she donated £1 million to help start up City Year in London. The Private Equity Foundation is City Year London's Lead Founding Partner.\n\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network on December 2, 2001. In the episode, Mr. Burns falls in love with Gloria, a woman who is much younger than he is and who turns out to be Snake Jailbird's ex-girlfriend.\n\nThe episode was written by John Swartzwelder, directed by Lance Kramer and dedicated to the memory of George Harrison. The episode featured, along with George Takei as a waiter and Karl Wiedergott as a delivery boy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who appeared as Mr Burns' love interest Gloria. \n\nThe episode received positive reviews from critics following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nThe Simpsons visit a Chinese restaurant, where Homer is hired to write Chinese fortune cookies after complaining that the current fortunes are unimaginative. One of his fortunes says \"You will find true love on Flag Day\". This cookie makes its way to Mr. Burns on, coincidentally, Flag Day. Eager for true love at last, Burns and a reluctant Smithers spend the evening womanising at a wealthy social gathering and a strip club. With mere minutes left in the day, Burns finds a cop ticketing his car, which he had parked in the middle of the road. After discovering the cop is a beautiful woman named Gloria (voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Burns asks her out on a date. Gloria warily accepts, much to Burns' delight and Smithers' chagrin.\n\nAfter a pleasant first date at the carnival, Burns asks about another date but Gloria is about to turn him down when Homer runs by. Burns asks Homer to vouch for him to Gloria, so Homer regales her by listing Burns' many exploits. After Gloria agrees to a second date, Burns enlists Homer to be his \"youthful advisor\", accompanying the couple on their next date at the disco hall, and even carrying Burns and Gloria up the stairs when they go to have sex. In these cases, Burns overcomes his weakness and extreme age by means of a powerful aphrodisiac (made from an extract of the \"pocket fox\", a species which only existed for three weeks in the 16th century).\n\nEventually, during a date at the bowling alley, Burns decides to ask Gloria to marry him. She says yes. As Burns goes off to get some champagne to celebrate, Snake comes to rob the bowling alley, and is surprised to see Gloria, who turns out to be his ex-girlfriend. Despite Gloria's protests, Snake kidnaps her and Homer. When Burns finds Gloria's ring, dropped in the commotion, he assumes she ran off with Homer. Snake takes Gloria and Homer to his hideout. Though Gloria says she loves Burns, Snake vows he can change. The police arrive and confront Snake. Homer tries to escape but instead sets Snake's house on fire. Snake and Homer get out and Burns runs in to save Gloria, however he is soon overcome by the smoke and Gloria is then seen carrying him to safety. Although initially grateful, Gloria begins to reminisce about Snake, causing her to break up with Burns and become Snake's girl again.\n\n\"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\" was written by John Swartzwelder while Lance Kramer served as director. It first aired in the United States on December 2, 2001 on the Fox network.\n\nMike Scully, who worked as an executive producer and show runner for the episode, stated in the episode's DVD audio commentary that the first thing the writers tried to think of while writing the episode was how the Simpson family would fit into the story. In the episode's first draft, Gloria worked as a food truck driver; however, this was later changed so that she instead worked as a police lady. Scully also stated that, in the scene after Homer carries Burns and Gloria up the stairs, there were originally a lot of jokes about Homer \"taking care of business\" for Burns; however, the staff decided to leave it out since it would make Homer \"unlikable.\" In the episode, Snake Jailbird's mailbox reads \"Snake (Jailbird)\" which is a reference to a debate that the writers had over whether Snake's mailbox would read \"Snake\" or \"Jailbird\". Originally, the episode would end with Burns taking the \"pocket fox\" extract, however when seeing the animatic, the writers felt that that ending would be \"too slow\", so they changed it into Gloria falling in love with Snake again.\n\nOn the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Kramer stated that there was an issue over which color to paint the fortunes with. Kramer wanted the fortunes to be white while one of his co-workers suggested they should be pink. Kramer stated that the co-worker had been to a Chinese restaurant close to the studio that had pink fortunes, and that \"that's why she [colored the fortunes pink].\" The animators also found it difficult to draw Mr Burns happy. Kramer stated that Burns was \"designed to look like a vulture\" and look \"evil all the time\", so in order to make Burns look happy and more sympathetic, the animators had to change some things in Burns' regular model. For example, Burns' eyebrows are not visible through the majority of the episode. The scene with Mr Burns and Gloria on the Ferris wheel was difficult to animate as well, since the animators had to \"keep everything moving to sell it.\" In the scene in which Snake's house is burning down, the animators chose to color the sky red, in order to reflect the fire as well as make the scene \"a little more exciting.\"\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus guest-starred as Gloria in the episode. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, current show runner Al Jean stated that working with Louis-Dreyfus was \"an absolute pleasure\", stating that \"not only was she funny but you'd give her, like, one suggestion, and she'd do three great things with it.\" The waiter in the Chinese restaurant was portrayed by actor George Takei. Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among several characters on the show, supplied the voice for Woody Allen, who is seen in a writing room for fortune cookies, wondering what he's doing there. The delivery boy was portrayed by Karl Wiedergott, a voice actor who usually fill in for the male actors on \"The Simpsons\" when they are not available for the table read. Jean described him as \"versatile\" and \"very talented\".\n\nFollowing the release of thirteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" on DVD and Blu-ray on August 24, 2010, \"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\" received positive reviews from critics. \n\nWriting for \"Project:Blu\", Nate Boss was favorable, describing it as \"A hilarious episode, with some fantastic one liners\", and went on to say that the episode was \"so far the best in the season.\" \n\nRon Martin of \"411Mania\" was also positive towards the episode, writing \"The antics of Mr. Burns and Homer trying to woo a young police officer are at worst amusing, at most hilarious.\" He wrote that Snake Jailbird was \"a welcome side character\", and went on to write that the episode was the best of the first disc of \"The Simpsons\"' thirteenth season on DVD.\n\nJennifer Malkowski of \"DVD Verdict\" gave the episode a B+ rating, and wrote that the episodes highlights were \"Burns' reaction walking into a strip club\" [sic] and \"a fortune cookie Homer writes, 'You will be aroused by a shampoo commercial'.\" \n\nColin Jacobsson, writing for \"DVD Movie Guide\", stated that, while it was not as good as the previous episode, \"Homer the Moe\", \"A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love\" still \"offers a reasonably solid episode\". He liked the parts related to the fortune cookies, and stated that “Burns' attempts to woo a much younger woman fare pretty well”. He concluded his review by saying that “enough smiles and snickers emerge to make this an enjoyable show”. \n\n\"Obsessed With Film\"'s Adam Rayner, in his review of \"The Simpsons\"' thirteenth season, wrote that Julia Louis Dreyfus's appearance in the episode was \"arguably the best [cameo] of the season\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2196917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196917", "title": "Sweets and Sour Marge", "text": "Sweets and Sour Marge\n\n\"Sweets and Sour Marge\" is the eighth episode of \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> thirteenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 20, 2002. In the episode, Homer gathers Springfield's citizens to build the world's biggest human pyramid. When it collapses and fails to set the world record, Springfield earns the top spot as the world's fattest town. Marge sues Garth Motherloving's sugar company for making the town's citizens obese. When Springfield outlaws sugar, Homer conspires with Garth to smuggle it to town.\n\n\"Sweets and Sour Marge\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Mark Kirkland. It was dedicated to the memory of Ron Taylor. Omine conceived the episode after hearing about smokers who sued tobacco companies. While its plot is loosely based on \"Erin Brockovich\", the episode also features references to \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\" and Butterfinger. It also features Ben Stiller as Garth Motherloving. \n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.5 million viewers, finishing in 34th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nAt a library sale, Homer buys a book on world records published by Duff. After boring everyone with world record trivia, Homer gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. When Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town collecting Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials declare Springfield the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.\n\nThe townsfolk are happy to have broken a world record, but Marge worries the whole town is overweight. She learns that nearly everything they eat contains sugar. After complaining to Garth Motherloving, head of the Motherloving Sweets and Sugar Company, Marge sues the sugar industry with the help of Gil and Professor Frink. Judge Snyder sides with her and bans all sugar products in Springfield, angering Homer and most of the town.\n\nThe whole town goes cold turkey and suffers from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group — led by Garth Motherloving — which illegally schemes to return sugar to Springfield. Homer embarks with Bart, Apu, Mr. Burns and a cartoon vampire named Count Fudge-ula to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to Springfield's docks.\n\nWhen Marge pleads with him to dump the cargo, Homer has two choices: obey Marge and press the \"Drop Cargo\" button or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the \"Obey Bad Guy\" button. Homer drops the cargo and the sugar falls into the water near the Springfield docks. All Springfieldians — even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar — jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder declares the sugar ban over and dives in too. Marge is upset and considers giving up changing the world, but Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make the world a better place.\n\n\"Sweets and Sour Marge\" was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Mark Kirkland. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 20, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by Omine, who based it on a lawsuit at the time, wherein smokers sued tobacco companies for selling harmful wares. Omine found it \"kinda weird\" that the people did not take responsibility for their own health, and joked that, in the future, people might sue food companies for \"making them fat\", which eventually became the episode's plot. While making the episode, the \"Simpsons\" writers decided to compile a list of Springfield's fat residents. According to Omine, the list \"never ended\", and when the writers realized the amount of fat people there were in Springfield, they decided that the residents should try and \"go for the world record\" in the \"fattest people\" category. The writers then decided that the residents were trying to set the world record for largest human pyramid, and then accidentally set the record for fattest population. The episode features the first appearance of Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty. The character was animated by Kirkland's assistant Matt Faughnan, who has since become a regular director for the series. Garth Motherloving, the head of the \"Motherloving Sweets and Sugar Company\", was portrayed by American actor and comedian Ben Stiller.\n\nAt one point in the episode, the Springfield residents try to set the record for largest human pyramid, which fails when the pyramid collapses, causing the people to roll into a giant ball. According to director Kirkland, the scene, which the staff members refer to as the \"people ball\", was very difficult to animate, and it \"almost gave [him] a migraine\" determining how to implement it in the episode. While trying to figure out how to animate the \"people ball\", Kirkland spray-painted a globe with white primer and assigned layout artist Paul Wee to draw the Springfield citizens on it with black ink. Normally, the \"Simpsons\" animators each draw ten scenes per week, but because he drew the \"people ball\", Wee was excused from these duties. Since drawing the \"people ball\" by hand would have \"murdered\" the animators, they soon decided to photograph it for each frame of the scene. The photographs were taken in Kirkland's garage and were then photocopied using a Xerox photocopier. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean stated that the technique for animating the \"people ball\" was \"extremely interesting\", although it has never been used again in the series. The \"master drawing\" of the human pyramid, which Kirkland also stated was very complicated, took animator Matthew Schofield a couple of days to draw. The drawing then became a reference for the other animators to use when animating the scene.\n\n\"Sweets and Sour Marge\"'s plot is loosely based on the 2000 drama film \"Erin Brockovich\", which revolves around Erin Brockovich's legal fight against the US West Coast energy corporation Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The \"Duff Book of World Records\" is a parody of the annually published reference book \"Guinness Book of World Records\". Cereal mascot Count Fudgula is a spoof of the General Mills cereal mascot Count Chocula (who, in turn, parodies fictional character Count Dracula). After sugar becomes banned in Springfield, the town's police force can be seen burning confiscated sugar products. However, when they throw an amount of Butterfinger candy bars in the fire, the bars start to glow and are left intact. Disappointed, police chief Clancy Wiggum explains \"Butterfingers. Even fire doesn't want them.\" For a long time, \"The Simpsons\" characters starred in Butterfinger commercials, which helped the series get launched by earning revenue from the commercials. Around the time \"Sweets and Sour Marge\" was written, the series contract with Butterfinger was terminated, and the staff therefore decided to make fun of it. \"If it had still been in existence, we wouldn't have done it\", Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty is loosely based on Darlene Cates' character Bonnie Grape in the 1993 film \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\". During the boat chase when Wiggum pursues Homer for the sugar cargo (narrowly avoiding two boats transporting a huge glass pane and a mother and child riding a combined jet ski-stroller), the Miami Vice Theme is played. Before he agrees to hand the sugar cargo to Motherloving, Homer demands that he gets to see an Oompa Loompa, a character from the 1964 children's book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". The Oompa Loompa's design is based on the version used in the 1971 film adaptation \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", which Kirkland watched in order to \"get [the design] right.\"\n\nIn its original American broadcast on January 20, 2002, \"Sweets and Sour Marge\" received a 7.3 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.5 million viewers. The episode finished in 34th place in the ratings for the week of January 14–20, 2002. On August 24, 2010, \"Sweets and Sour Marge\" was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray set. Al Jean, Carolyn Omine, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Mark Kirkland and Matt Warburton participated in the audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Sweets and Sour Marge\" received mixed reviews from critics. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review, writing \"What would Marge do on the show if she didn’t stage campaigns to tell others what to do? Despite the risk of redundancy, 'Sweets' actually works quite well.\" He praised Stiller's appearance in the episode, as well as the \"exploration of the records book\". He concluded his review by considering it \"one of Season 13's stronger programs\". \n\nNate Boss of Project-Blu was favorable as well, calling the episode \"A funny take on class-action suits (particularly those concerning other consumer products willingly purchased, like tobacco), as well as prohibition.\" \n\nDVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski gave the episode a B rating, and wrote that the \"library's 'Yes, we have pornography!' banner\" was the episode's \"highlight\". \n\nGiving it a more mixed review, Ron Martin of 411Mania called the episode \"uneven at best, mediocre at worst\".\n\nAndre Dellamorte of Collider described it as a \"redress\" of the season 8 episode \"Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment\", in which Springfield is faced with prohibition.\n\n"}

{"id": "2196932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196932", "title": "Ratlines (World War II aftermath)", "text": "Ratlines (World War II aftermath)\n\n\"Ratlines\" were a system of escape routes for Nazis and other fascists fleeing Europe in the aftermath of World War II. These escape routes mainly led toward havens in Latin America, particularly Argentina though also in Chile, Paraguay, Colombia, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, Ecuador, and Bolivia, as well as the United States, Spain and Switzerland. \n\nThere were two primary routes: the first went from Germany to Spain, then Argentina; the second from Germany to Rome to Genoa, then South America. The two routes developed independently but eventually came together. The ratlines were supported by clergy of the Catholic Church, and historian Michael Phayer claims this was supported by the Vatican.\n\nWhile Nazi leader Adolf Hitler is unanimously considered by reputable scholars to have committed suicide in Berlin near the end of the war, various conspiracy theories claim that he survived the war and fled to Argentina.\n\nThe origins of the first ratlines are connected to various developments in Vatican-Argentine relations before and during World War II. As early as 1942, Monsignor Luigi Maglione contacted Ambassador Llobet, inquiring as to the \"willingness of the government of the Argentine Republic to apply its immigration law generously, in order to encourage at the opportune moment European Catholic immigrants to seek the necessary land and capital in our country\". Afterwards, a German priest, Anton Weber, the head of the Rome-based Society of Saint Raphael, traveled to Portugal, continuing to Argentina, to lay the groundwork for future Catholic immigration; this was to be a route which fascist exiles would exploit. According to historian Michael Phayer, \"this was the innocent origin of what would become the Vatican ratline\".\n\nSpain, not Rome, was the \"first center of ratline activity that facilitated the escape of Nazi fascists,\" although the exodus itself was planned within the Vatican. Among the primary organizers were Charles Lescat, a French member of Action Française – an organization suppressed by Pope Pius XI and rehabilitated by Pope Pius XII – and Pierre Daye, a Belgian with contacts in the Spanish government. Lescat and Daye were the first to flee Europe with the help of Argentine cardinal Antonio Caggiano.\n\nBy 1946, there were hundreds of war criminals in Spain, and thousands of former Nazis and fascists. According to then-United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Vatican cooperation in turning over these \"asylum-seekers\" was \"negligible\". According to Phayer, Pius XII \"preferred to see fascist war criminals on board ships sailing to the New World rather than seeing them rotting in POW camps in zonal Germany\". Unlike the Vatican emigration operation in Italy that centered on Vatican City, the ratlines of Spain, although \"fostered by the Vatican,\" were relatively independent of the hierarchy of the Vatican Emigration Bureau.\n\nAustrian Catholic bishop Alois Hudal, a Nazi sympathiser, was rector of the Pontificio Istituto Teutonico Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome, a seminary for Austrian and German priests, and \"Spiritual Director of the German People resident in Italy\". After the end of the war in Italy, Hudal became active in ministering to German-speaking prisoners of war and internees then held in camps throughout Italy. In December 1944, the Vatican Secretariat of State received permission to appoint a representative to \"visit the German-speaking civil internees in Italy\", a job assigned to Hudal.\n\nHudal used this position to aid the escape of wanted Nazi war criminals, including Franz Stangl, commanding officer of Treblinka, Gustav Wagner, commanding officer of Sobibor, Alois Brunner, responsible for the Drancy internment camp near Paris and in charge of deportations in Slovakia to German concentration camps, and Adolf Eichmann—a fact about which he was later unashamedly open. Some of these wanted men were being held in internment camps: generally without identity papers, they would be enrolled in camp registers under false names. Other Nazis hid in Italy and sought Hudal out as his role in assisting escapes became known on the Nazi grapevine.\n\nIn his memoirs, Hudal said of his actions, \"I thank God that He [allowed me] to visit and comfort many victims in their prisons and concentration camps and to help them escape with false identity papers.\" He explained that in his eyes:\n\nThe Allies' War against Germany was not a crusade, but the rivalry of economic complexes for whose victory they had been fighting. This so-called business ... used catchwords like democracy, race, religious liberty and Christianity as a bait for the masses. All these experiences were the reason why I felt duty bound after 1945 to devote my whole charitable work mainly to former National Socialists and Fascists, especially to so-called 'war criminals'.\n\nAccording to Mark Aarons and John Loftus in their book \"Unholy Trinity\", Hudal was the first Catholic priest to dedicate himself to establishing escape routes. Aarons and Loftus claim that Hudal provided the objects of his charity with money to help them escape and, more importantly, provided them with false papers, including identity documents issued by the Vatican Refugee Organisation (\"Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza\"). These Vatican papers were not full passports and thus were not enough to gain passage overseas. They were, rather, the first stop in a paper trail—they could be used to obtain a displaced person passport from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which in turn could be used to apply for visas. In theory, the ICRC would perform background checks on passport applicants, but in practice the word of a priest or particularly a bishop would be good enough. According to statements collected by Austrian writer Gitta Sereny from a senior official of the Rome branch of the ICRC, Hudal could also use his position as a bishop to request papers from the ICRC \"made out according to his specifications\". Sereny's sources also revealed an active illicit trade in stolen and forged ICRC papers in Rome at the time.\n\nAccording to declassified U.S. intelligence reports, Hudal was not the only priest helping Nazi escapees at this time. In the \"La Vista Report\" declassified in 1984, Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) operative Vincent La Vista told how he had easily arranged for two bogus Hungarian refugees to get false ICRC documents with the help of a letter from a Father Joseph Gallov. Gallov, who ran a Vatican-sponsored charity for Hungarian refugees, asked no questions and wrote a letter to his \"personal contact in the International Red Cross, who then issued the passports\".\n\nAccording to Aarons and Loftus, Hudal's private operation was small scale compared to what came later. The major Roman ratline was operated by a small, but influential network of Croatian priests, members of the Franciscan order, led by Father Krunoslav Draganović, who organized a highly sophisticated chain with headquarters at the San Girolamo degli Illirici Seminary College in Rome, but with links from Austria to the final embarcation point at the port of Genoa. The ratline initially focused on aiding members of the Croatian Ustaše including its leader (or Poglavnik), Ante Pavelić.\n\nPriests active in the chain included: Fr. Vilim Cecelja, former Deputy Military Vicar to the Ustaše, based in Austria where many Ustashe and Nazi refugees remained in hiding; Fr. Dragutin Kamber, based at San Girolamo; Fr. Dominik Mandić, an official Vatican representative at San Girolamo and also \"General Economist\" or treasurer of the Franciscan order - who used this position to put the Franciscan press at the ratline's disposal; and Monsignor Karlo Petranović, based in Genoa. Vilim would make contact with those hiding in Austria and help them across the border to Italy; Kamber, Mandić and Draganović would find them lodgings, often in the monastery itself, while they arranged documentation; finally Draganović would phone Petranović in Genoa with the number of required berths on ships leaving for South America (see below).\n\nThe operation of the Draganović ratline was an open secret among the intelligence and diplomatic communities in Rome. As early as August 1945, Allied commanders in Rome were asking questions about the use of San Girolamo as a \"haven\" for Ustaše.\n\nA year later, a US State Department report of 12 July 1946 lists nine war criminals, including Albanians and Montenegrins as well as Croats, plus others \"not actually sheltered in the COLLEGIUM ILLIRICUM [i.e., San Girolamo degli Illirici] but who otherwise enjoy Church support and protection.\" The British envoy to the Holy See, Sir D'Arcy Osborne, asked Domenico Tardini, a high-ranking Vatican official, for permission that would have allowed British military police to raid ex-territorial Vatican Institutions in Rome. Tardini declined and denied the church was sheltering war criminals.\n\nIn February 1947, CIC Special Agent Robert Clayton Mudd reported ten members of Pavelić's Ustaša cabinet living either in San Girolamo or in the Vatican itself. Mudd had infiltrated an agent into the monastery and confirmed that it was \"honeycombed with cells of Ustashe operatives\" guarded by \"armed youths\". Mudd reported:\n\nIt was further established that these Croats travel back and forth from the Vatican several times a week in a car with a chauffeur whose license plate bears the two initials CD, \"Corpo Diplomatico\". It issues forth from the Vatican and discharges its passengers inside the Monastery of San Geronimo. Subject to diplomatic immunity it is impossible to stop the car and discover who are its passengers.\n\nMudd's conclusion was the following:\nDRAGANOVIC's sponsorship of these Croat Ustashes definitely links him up with the plan of the Vatican to shield these ex-Ustasha nationalists until such time as they are able to procure for them the proper documents to enable them to go to South America. The Vatican, undoubtedly banking on the strong anti-Communist feelings of these men, is endeavoring to infiltrate them into South America in any way possible to counteract the spread of Red doctrine. It has been reliably reported, for example that Dr. VRANCIC has already gone to South America and that Ante PAVELIC and General KREN are scheduled for an early departure to South America through Spain. All these operations are said to have been negotiated by DRAGANOVIC because of his influence in the Vatican.\n\nThe existence of Draganović's ratline has been supported by a highly respected historian of Vatican diplomacy, Fr. Robert Graham: \"I've no doubt that Draganović was extremely active in syphoning off his Croatian Ustashe friends.\" Graham claimed that Draganović, in running his 'ratline,' was not acting on behalf of the Vatican: \"Just because he's a priest doesn't mean he represents the Vatican. It was his own operation.\" At the same time, there were four occasions in which the Vatican did intervene on behalf of interned Ustasha prisoners. The Secretariat of State asked the UK and US governments to release Croatian POWs from British internment camps in Italy.\n\nIf at first U.S. intelligence officers had been mere observers of the Draganović ratline, this changed in the summer of 1947. A now declassified U.S. Army intelligence report from 1950 sets out in detail the history of the people smuggling operation in the three years to follow.\n\nAccording to the report, from this point on U.S. forces themselves had begun to use Draganović's established network to evacuate its own \"visitors\". As the report put it, these were \"visitors who had been in the custody of the 430th CIC and completely processed in accordance with current directives and requirements, and whose continued residence in Austria constituted a security threat as well as a source of possible embarrassment to the Commanding General of USFA, since the Soviet Command had become aware that their presence in U.S. Zone of Austria and in some instances had requested the return of these persons to Soviet custody\".\n\nThese were suspected war criminals from areas occupied by the Red Army which the U.S. was obliged to hand over for trial to the Soviets. The U.S. reputedly was reluctant to do so, partly due to a belief that fair trials could hardly be expected in the USSR (see Operation Keelhaul), and at the same time, their desire to make use of Nazi scientists and other resources. \n\nThe deal with Draganović involved getting the visitors to Rome: \"Dragonovich handled all phases of the operation after the defectees arrived in Rome, such as the procurement of IRO Italian and South American documents, visas, stamps, arrangements for disposition, land or sea, and notification of resettlement committees in foreign lands\".\n\nUnited States intelligence used these methods in order to get important Nazi scientists and military strategists, to the extent they had not already been claimed by the Soviet Union, to their own centres of military science in the US. Many Nazi scientists were employed by the U.S., retrieved in Operation Paperclip.\n\nIn Nuremberg at that time something was taking place that I personally considered a disgrace and an unfortunate lesson for the future of humanity. I became certain that the Argentine people also considered the Nuremberg process a disgrace, unworthy of the victors, who behaved as if they hadn't been victorious. Now we realize that they [the Allies] deserved to lose the war.<br>\n—Argentine president Juan Perón on the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals\nIn his 2002 book, \"The Real Odessa\", Argentine researcher Uki Goñi used new access to the country's archives to show that Argentine diplomats and intelligence officers had, on Perón's instructions, vigorously encouraged Nazi and fascist war criminals to make their home in Argentina. According to Goñi, the Argentines not only collaborated with Draganović's ratline, they set up further ratlines of their own running through Scandinavia, Switzerland and Belgium.\n\nAccording to Goñi, Argentina's first move into Nazi smuggling was in January 1946, when Argentine bishop Antonio Caggiano, leader of the Argentine chapter of Catholic Action flew with another bishop, Agustín Barrére, to Rome where Caggiano was due to be anointed Cardinal. In Rome the Argentine bishops met with French Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, where they passed on a message (recorded in Argentina's diplomatic archives) that \"the Government of the Argentine Republic was willing to receive French persons, whose political attitude during the recent war would expose them, should they return to France, to harsh measures and private revenge\".\n\nOver the spring of 1946, a number of French war criminals, fascists and Vichy officials made it from Italy to Argentina in the same way: they were issued passports by the Rome ICRC office; these were then stamped with Argentine tourist visas (the need for health certificates and return tickets was waived on Caggiano's recommendation). The first documented case of a French war criminal arriving in Buenos Aires was Émile Dewoitine, who was later sentenced in absentia to 20 years hard labour. He sailed first class on the same ship back with Cardinal Caggiano.\n\nShortly after this Argentinian Nazi smuggling became institutionalised, according to Goñi, when Perón's new government of February 1946 appointed anthropologist Santiago Peralta as Immigration Commissioner and former Ribbentrop agent Ludwig Freude as his intelligence chief. Goñi argues that these two then set up a \"rescue team\" of secret service agents and immigration \"advisors\", many of whom were themselves European war-criminals, with Argentine citizenship and employment.\n\nIn 2014, over 700 FBI documents were declassified revealing that the US government had undertaken an investigation in the late 1940s and 1950s as to the reports of the possible escape of Adolf Hitler from Germany. Some leads purported that he had not committed suicide in Berlin but had fled Germany in 1945, and eventually arrived in Argentina via Spain. Within the pages of these documents are statements, naming people and places involved in Hitler's alleged journey from Germany to South America including mention of the ratlines that were already in existence. Additional CIA documents contain reported sightings and in 1954. The claim related to the photograph made by a self-proclaimed former German SS trooper named Phillip Citroen that Hitler was still alive, and that he \"left Colombia for Argentina around January 1955.\" Enclosed with the CIA report was the alleged photograph of Citroen and a person he claimed to be Hitler. The CIA report states that neither the contact who reported his conversations with Citroen, nor the CIA station was \"in a position to give an intelligent evaluation of the information\". The station chief's superiors told him that \"enormous efforts could be expended on this matter with remote possibilities of establishing anything concrete\", and the investigation was dropped.\n\nThe Italian and Argentine ratlines have only been confirmed relatively recently, mainly due to research in newly declassified archives. Until the work of Aarons and Loftus, and of Uki Goñi (2002), a common view was that ex-Nazis themselves, organised in secret networks, ran the escape routes alone. The most famous such network is ODESSA (Organisation of former SS members), founded in 1946 according to Simon Wiesenthal, which included SS-Obersturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny and Sturmbannführer Alfred Naujocks and, in Argentina, Rodolfo Freude. Alois Brunner, former commandant of Drancy internment camp near Paris, escaped to Rome, then Syria, by ODESSA. Brunner was thought to be the highest-ranking Nazi war criminal still alive as of 2007.\n\nPersons claiming to represent ODESSA claimed responsibility for the unsuccessful July 9, 1979, car bombing in France aimed at Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld. According to Paul Manning, \"eventually, over 10,000 former German military made it to South America along escape routes ODESSA and Deutsche Hilfsverein...\"\n\nSimon Wiesenthal, who advised Frederick Forsyth on the early 1970s novel/film script \"The Odessa File\" which brought the name to public attention, also names other Nazi escape organisations such as \"Spinne\" (\"Spider\") and \"Sechsgestirn\" (\"Constellation of Six\"). Wiesenthal describes these immediately after the war as Nazi cells based in areas of Austria where many Nazis had retreated and gone to ground. Wiesenthal claimed that the ODESSA network shepherded escapees to the Catholic ratlines in Rome (although he mentions only Hudal, not Draganović); or through a second route through France and into Francoist Spain.\n\nODESSA was supported by the Gehlen Organization, which employed many former Nazi party members, and was headed by Reinhard Gehlen, a former German Army intelligence officer employed post-war by the CIA. The Gehlen Organization became the nucleus of the BND German intelligence agency, directed by Reinhard Gehlen from its 1956 creation until 1968.\n\nSome of the Nazis and war criminals who escaped using ratlines include:\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "2196955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196955", "title": "Schistosoma intercalatum", "text": "Schistosoma intercalatum\n\nSchistosoma intercalatum is a parasitic worm found in parts of western and central Africa. There are two strains: the Lower Guinea strain and the Zaire strain. \"S. intercalatum\" is one of the major agents of the rectal form of schistosomiasis, also called bilharzia. It is a trematode, and being part of the genus \"Schistosoma\", it is commonly referred to as a blood-fluke since the adult resides in blood vessels.\n\nHumans are the definitive host and two species of freshwater snail make up the intermediate host, \"Bulinus forskalii\" for the Lower Guinea strain and \"Bulinus africanus\" for the Zaire strain.\n\nThe clinically defining characteristic of most schistosome species are their eggs' size and shape. The eggs of \"Schistosoma intercalatum\" have a terminal spine and tend to be moderately larger than those of \"S. haematobium\" (approximately 130 × 75 μm). The origin of the name 'intercalatum' is from the observation that their eggs are of an intermediate range between the smaller \"S. haematobium\" and larger \"S. bovis\". These eggs are unique because they will stain red when exposed to the Ziehl-Neelsen technique, aiding in identification. When viewed using scanning electron microscopy, it can be observed that the \"S. intercalatum's\" surface has a much lower amount of integumental elevations, or bosses, than \"S. mansoni\". This feature is consistent with the tegument appearance of other terminally spined schistosomes.\n\n\"Schistosoma intercalatum's\" life cycle is very similar to that of \"S. haematobium\", except for some key differences. To start the life cycle, the human host releases eggs with its feces. In water, the eggs hatch to become miracidia, which penetrate the freshwater snail intermediate host. \"S. intercalatum\" has two major strains, each with its own preferred bulinid host. The Zaire strain will use \"Bulinus africanus\", while the Lower Guinea strain will use the extremely common \"B. forskalii\" as its intermediate host. The miracidia penetrate the snail tissue, and inside they become sporocysts and multiply. The sporocysts then mature into cercariae inside the snail host and are ready to leave. The cercariae are free-swimming in the surrounding water until they find their definitive host: a human. If there is a small temperature change, the cercariae of \"S. intercalatum\" will form concentrated aggregates near the surface of the water. This mechanism for body heat detection of a potential host restricts the formation of viable cercariae to small streams and slow moving bodies of water because of their high sensitivity.\n\nThe cercariae penetrate through the human's skin and lose their tail, becoming schistosomulae. The schistosomulae then migrate to the hepatic portal system of the liver to mature into adults. As adults, they make their way to the inferior mesenteric vein and mate, producing thousands of eggs. These eggs migrate down to the mesenteric venules of the colon and form polyps as the eggs attempt to cross into the lumen. \"S. intercalatum's\" eggs are specific to the colon, making them unique among the infectious African schistosomes.\n\n\"S. intercalatum\" is at risk of endangerment in large part due to the introduction of invasive species into its native habitat. Since 1973, both \"S. mansoni\" and \"S. haematobium\" have been found in places that have been traditionally inhabited by \"S. intercalatum\". This is thought to be because of the increase in transportation accessibility and the increase in forestry jobs in these habitats. Male \"S. mansoni\" and \"S. haematobium\" will both take priority over \"S. intercalatum\" when it comes to mate selection, leading to a smaller proportion of female \"S. intercalatum\" available for mating. While crosses with \"S. mansoni\" give no viable offspring, the pairing with a male \"S. haematobium\" will result in a hybrid organism. Most hybrids will have a diluted genome that is more closely related to \"S. haematobium\", helping to bring about a decline in \"S. intercalatum\" populations. The other obstacle restricting the parasite's population growth is its selective distribution. The cercariae are very particular over where they develop, needing small, forested areas with streams to infect their human host. There are only a few of these regions in Africa, and they decrease in size every day due to deforestation.\n\nIn 2009, there were an estimated 200 million human infections of schistosomiasis. In 1999, the noted number of \"S. intercalatum\" infections was 1.73 million.\n\nThere are two major strains of \"S. intercalatum\", both living in forested areas of Africa. One strain lives in the Congo area, particularly Zaire, and the other strain lives in the Lower Guinea area, mainly in Cameroon. Cameroon is a place of scientific interest because it is where all three species of human schistosomes live. Most relevant research conducted on \"S. intercalatum\" was performed in, or around, the Loum area in Cameroon.\n\nSymptoms of all forms of schistosomiasis are caused by the immune system's reaction to the eggs, rather than the adult worms themselves. A few hours to days after cercariae invade the skin, some people experience pruritus and raised papules at the site of penetration. This is called cercarial dermatitis, also known as swimmer's itch. It can last up to a few weeks, although, this stage is usually asymptomatic in local populations. \"S. intercalatum\" is associated with lower morbidity than the other schistosomes that infect humans. In a study done on schoolchildren in the Republic of São Tomé and Principe in western Africa–where \"S. intercalatum\" and \"S. haematobium\" are endemic–the only schistosome present in the sample was \"S. intercalatum\", an overall prevalence of 10.9 percent in stool specimens.\n\nUnlike the more pathogenic species, infection with \"S. intercalatum\" is usually only associated with bloody stool, and sometimes splenomegaly. Blood in the stool is caused by \"inflammation, hypertrophy, and ulceration of the mucosa\" of the intestine. These signs can be difficult to interpret because effected populations are often infected with multiple intestinal parasites. Clinical presentation of an established \"S. intercalatum\" infection can be different in the local population and non-immune tourists. The majority of infections of foreign travelers are asymptomatic and go unnoticed. Chronic schistosomiasis results in granulomata forming around eggs in the mesenteric vessels.\n\nDiagnosis is usually made using clinical and epidemiological information. Infection with \"S. intercalatum\" can be distinguished from that of \"S. mansoni\" or \"S. haematobium\" based on where eggs manifest outside the body and the morphology of the eggs. In Africa, the only species of schistosome are \"S. intercalatum\", \"S. mansoni\", and \"S. haematobium\". \"S. haematobium\" causes urinary schistosomiasis, so eggs will be shed in the urine; \"S. mansoni\" and \"S. intercalatum\" reside in the mesenteric venous plexus, so eggs will be shed in the feces. Looking at the stool specimen under a microscope, the species can be distinguished; \"S. intercalatum\" eggs have a terminal spine (as seen in the figure above) and \"S. mansoni\" eggs have a lateral spine.\n\nSerologic testing looks for the presence of antibodies against the adult schistosome in the blood. This can only take place 6 to 8 weeks after initial infection in order for the parasite to reach the adult stage and the immune system to produce antibodies against it. However, serologic testing is not useful for patients with previous infections.\n\nPraziquantel is an effective treatment against all species of \"Schistosoma\" that infect humans. Administering treatment at the correct time is important since the drug only works against the adult worm and there must be a strong antibody response from the immune system. Thus, it should be administered 6 to 8 weeks after suspected infection (contact with infested freshwater). There has been limited evidence on possible drug resistance among the schistosomes due to reports of low cure rates. Oxaminiquine is another treatment for schistosomiasis, but it is not widely available, nor is it routinely used.\n\n"}

For example, it is applied to bananas to ensure freshness, and is a common ingredient in the waxes applied to the skins of citrus fruits. It is not approved as a food additive in the EU, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nUse in treatment of aspergillosis has been reported.\n\nIt is also used in anti-fungal wallboards as a mixture with azoxystrobin.\n\nAs an antiparasitic, tiabendazole is able to control roundworms (such as those causing strongyloidiasis), hookworms, and other helminth species which infect wild animals, livestock, and humans.\n\nIn dogs and cats, tiabendazole is used to treat ear infections.\n\nTiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead, mercury, or antimony poisoning.\n\nGenes responsible for the maintenance of cell walls in yeast have been shown to be responsible for angiogenesis in vertebrates. Tiabendazole serves to block angiogenesis in both frog embryos and human cells. It has also been shown to serve as a vascular disrupting agent to reduce newly established blood vessels. Tiabendazole has been shown to effectively do this in certain cancer cells.\n\nTiabendazole works by inhibition of the mitochondrial, helminth-specific enzyme, fumarate reductase, with possible interaction with endogenous quinone.\n\nThe substance appears to have a slight toxicity in higher doses, with effects such as liver and intestinal disorders at high exposure in test animals (just below level). Some reproductive disorders and decreasing weaning weight have been observed, also at high exposure. Effects on humans from use as a drug include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, or headache; very rarely also ringing in the ears, vision changes, stomach pain, yellowing eyes and skin, dark urine, fever, fatigue, increased thirst and change in the amount of urine occur. Carcinogenic effects have been shown at higher doses.\n\nIntermediate arylamidine 2 is prepared by aluminium trichloride-catalyzed addition of aniline to the nitrile of 4-cyanothiazole (1). The amidine (2) is then converted to its \"N\"-chloro derivative 3 with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Upon treatment with base, this undergoes a nitrene insertion reaction (4) to produce tiabendazole (5).\n\nAn alternative synthesis involves reacting 4-thiazolecarboxamide with \"o\"-phenylenediamine in polyphosphoric acid.\n\nA number of derivatives of tiabendazole are also pharmaceutical drugs, including\nalbendazole, cambendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, mebendazole, and flubendazole.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2196984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196984", "title": "Schistosoma haematobium", "text": "Schistosoma haematobium\n\nSchistosoma haematobium (urinary blood fluke) is a species of digenetic trematode, belonging to a group (genus) of blood flukes (\"Schistosoma\"). It is found in Africa and the Middle East. It is the major agent of schistosomiasis, the most prevalent parasitic infection in humans. It is the only blood fluke that infects the urinary tract, causing urinary schistosomiasis, and is the leading cause of bladder cancer (only next to tobacco smoking). The diseases are caused by the eggs.\n\nAdults are found in the venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs travels to the wall of the urine bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as hydronephrosis. Inflammation of the genitals due to \"S. haematobium\" may contribute to the propagation of HIV.\n\n\"S. haematobium\" was the first blood fluke discovered. Theodor Bilharz, a German surgeon working in Cairo, identified the parasite as a causative agent of urinary infection in 1851. After the discoverer, the infection (generally including all schistosome infections) was called bilharzia or bilharziasis. Along with other helminth parasites \"Clonorchis sinensis\" and \"Opisthorchis viverrini\", \"S. haematobium\" was declared as Group 1 (extensively proven) carcinogens by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans in 2009.\n\nBloody urine (haematurea) was recorded by Ancient Egyptians in papyri 5,000 years ago. They called it \"Aaa\". The first scientific report was by Marc Armand Ruffer, a British physician in Egypt, in 1910. He discovered parasite eggs from two mummies, which were dated to around 1250–1000 BC. The oldest infection known to date was revealed using ELISA, which is more than 5,000 years old. In 1851, Theodor Maximillian Bilharz, a German physician at the Kasr el-Aini Hospital in Cairo recovered the adult fluke from a dead soldier. He named it \"Distomum haematobium\", for its apparent two mouths (now called ventral and oral suckers) and habitat of the blood vessel. He published the formal description in 1852. The genus \"Distomum\" (literally \"two-mouthed\") was created by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for all flukes; hence, it was not specific. Another German physician Heinrich Meckel von Hemsbach introduced a new name \"Bilharzia haematobium\" in 1856 to honour the discoverer. He also introduced the medical term bilharzia or bilharziasis to describe the infection. Unbeknown to von Hemsbach, a German zoologist David Friedrich Weinland established a new genus \"Schistosoma\" in 1858. After almost a century of taxonomic dispute, \"Schistosoma\" was validated by ICZN in 1954; thereby validating the name \"Schistosoma haematobium\".\n\nThe infectious nature was discovered by British physician Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915. He successfully infected mice, rats, guinea pigs, and monkey using cercariae from four species of snails, belonging to \"Bullinus\" (now \"Bulinus\") and \"Planorbis\", which were collected from El Marg canal near Cairo; proving that snails are the intermediate hosts.\n\nIts role in cancer was first noted by a British Surgeon Reginald Harrison, at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, in 1889. He recorded that four people out of five cancer victims had bilharzia. A German physician Carl Goebel confirmed in 1903 that bladder tumour occurred in most bilharzia patients. By 1905, he was convinced that carcinoma of bladder was due to bilharzia. After decades of assessing the medical reports, it was finally declared by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans in 2009 that \"S. haematobium\" is Group 1 carcinogen.\n\nAdult \"Schistosoma haematobium\" has male and female, which are permanently paired (a condition called \"in copula\") as what looks like an individual. The male forms the flatworm part, measuring 10–18 mm in length and 1 mm in width. It bears oral and ventral suckers towards its anterior end. Its leaf-like flat body is curled up from both sides to form a channel or groove called gynaecophoric canal in which the female is wrapped up. Thus, it gives the general appearance of a cylindrical roundworm body. Only the extreme anterior and posterior ends of the female are exposed. In contrast to the male, a female exhibits every feature of a roundworm. It is cylindrical and elongated, measuring about 20 mm in length and 0.25 mm in width. Its pathogenic armament, the eggs are oval-shaped, measuring 144 × 58 µm in diameter, with characteristic terminal spine. This is an important diagnostic tool because co-infection with \"S. mansoni\" (having a lateral-spined eggs) is common.\n\nThe miracidium measures about 136 μm long and 55 μm wide. The body is covered by anucleate epidermal plates separated by epidermal ridges. The epidermal cells give off numerous hair-like cilia on the body surface. Epidermal plate is absent only at the extreme anterior called apical papilla, or terebratorium, which contains numerous sensory organelles. Its internal body is almost fully filled with glycogen particles and vesicles.\n\nThe ceraria has a characteristic bifurcated tail, classically called furcae (Latin for fork); hence, the name (derived from a Greek word κέρκος, \"kerkos\", meaning tail). The body is pear-shaped and measures 0.24 mm in length and 0.1 mm in width. Its tegument is fully covered with spine. A conspicuous oral sucker is at the tip of the body.\n\n\"S. haematobium\" completes it life cycle in humans, as definitive hosts, and freshwater snails, as intermediate hosts, just like other schistosomes. But unlike other schistosomes that release eggs in the intestine, it releases its eggs in the urinary tract and excrete along with the urine. In stagnant freshwater, the eggs hatch within 15 minutes into the larvae called miracidia. Each miracidium is either male or female. Miracidia are covered with hair-like cilia with which actively swims searching for snails. Unless they infect a snail within 24–28 hours, they run out of energy (glycogen) reserves and die. Species of snail belonging to the genus \"Bulinus\", including \"B. globosus\", \"B. forskalii\", \"B. nasutus\", \"B. nyassanus\", and \"B. truncatus\", can harbour the miracidia. The miracidia simply pierce through the soft skin of the snail and move to the liver. Inside the snail, their cilia is cast off and extra-epithelial covering forms within 24 hours. Then they transform into sporocysts and undergo active cell division after two weeks. The mother sporocyst produces many daughter sporocysts. Each daughter sporocyst forms new larvae called cercariae. One mother sporocyst produces half a million cercariae. After a month, the sporocysts rupture and cercariae are liberated. Free cercariae penetrate the liver and move out of the snail into water. Each cercaria has a biforked tail with which it swims to find a human host. Again the cercariae are short lived and can survive in water for 4–6 days unless they find a human host.\n\nWhen human comes in contact with an infested water, the cercariae attach themselves on the skin using their suckers. After proper orientation, they start piercing the skin by secreting proteolytic enzymes that widen the skin pores (hair follicles). This process takes about 3–5 minutes and produces itching, but by then, they have penetrated the skin. Their tails are removed during the penetration such that only the head parts enter. When they enter the blood vessels, they are known as schisotomulae. They enter the systemic system to reach the heart and then the liver, and along the way many are killed by the immune cells. Survivors enter the liver within 24 hours. From the liver they enter the portal vein to reach different parts of the body. Unlike other species again, the schistosomulae of \"S. haematobium\" reach the vesical vessels through anastomotic channels between radicles of the inferior mesenteric vein and pelvic veins. After living inside small venules in the submucosa and wall of the bladder, they migrate to the perivesical venous plexus (a group of veins at the lower portion of the bladder) to attain full maturation. To evade detection by the host's immune system, the adults have the ability to coat themselves with host antigen.\n\nIndividuals sort out opposite sexes. The female body becomes enveloped within the rolled-up gynaecophoric canal of the male; thus, becoming partners for life. Sexual maturation is attained after 4–6 weeks of initial infection. A female generally lays 500-1,000 eggs in a day. The female only leaves the male briefly for laying eggs. It has to because only it can enter the small and narrow peripheral venule in the submucosa so that the eggs can be released into the bladder. The embryonated eggs penetrate the bladder mucosa using proteolytic enzymes, aided by their terminal spines and by the contraction of the bladder. The enzyme is a toxin specifically for damaging (necrosis) the tissue. Under normal situation, the eggs released into the bladder do not cause pathological symptoms. But eggs often fail to penetrate the bladder mucosa and remain trapped in the bladder wall; it is these which produce the lesions by releasing their antigens and provoking granuloma formation. Granulomata in turn coalesce to form tubercles, nodules or masses that often ulcerate. This is the condition behind the pathological lesions found in the bladder wall, ureter and renal; and also tumour, both benign and malignant. The fluke continuously lays eggs throughout their life. An average lifespan is 3–4 years.\n\nTraditionally, diagnoses has been made by examination of the urine for eggs. In chronic infections, or if eggs are difficult to find, an intradermal injection of schistosome antigen to form a wheal is effective in determining infection. Alternatively diagnosis can be made by complement fixation tests. , commercial blood tests included ELISA and an Indirect immunofluorescence test, but these have low sensitivity ranging from 21% to 71%.\n\nThe main cause of schistomiasis is the dumping of human waste into water supplies. Hygienic disposal of waste would be sufficient to eliminate the disease. Water for drinking and bathing should be boiled in endemic regions. Infested water should be avoided. However, agricultural activities such as fishing and rice cultivation involve long contact with water, making avoidance impractical. Systematic eradication of snails is an effective method.\n\nNormal infection of adults does not produce symptoms. When eggs are released, they sometimes become permanently stuck in the bladder and cause pathological symptoms. The eggs are initially deposited in the muscularis propria which leads to ulceration of the overlaying tissue. Infections are characterized by pronounced acute inflammation, squamous metaplasia, blood and reactive epithelial changes. Granulomas and multinucleated giant cells may be seen. The eggs induce a granulomatous host immune response which is indicated by lymphocytes (which mainly produce T-helper-2 cytokines such as interleukins 4, 5, and 13), eosinophils, and, also activated macrophages. This granuloma formation induces chronic inflammation.\n\nIn response to infection, the hosts' antibodies bind to the tegument of the schistosome. But they are quickly removed the tegument itself is shed every few hours. The schistosome can also take on host proteins. Schistomiasis can be divided into three phases: (1) the migratory phase lasting from penetration to maturity,(2) the acute phase which occurs when the schistosomes begin producing eggs, and (3) the chronic phase which occurs mainly in endemic areas. In late stage, the infection may lead to extra-urinary complication named Bilharzial cor pulmonale. The distinct symptom for urogenital schistosomiasis is blood in the urine (haematuria), which is often associated with frequent urination, painful micturition, and discomfort in the groin. In endemic regions, haematuria is so widespread that it is thought a natural sign of puberty for boys, and is confused with menses in girls. Under serious infection, urinary tract can be blocked leading to obstructive uropathy (hydroureter and hydronephrosis), which can be further complicated by bacterial infection and kidney failure. In the most severe condition, chronic bladder ulcers and bladder carcinoma develop.\n\nThe drug of choice is praziquantel, a quinolone derivative. But it has low cure rate (only 82-88%).\n\n\"S. hematobium\" is found in Africa and the Middle East, where infants and young children are most infected. Infection is most prevalent in both the Nile Delta and the Nile Valley South of Cairo. The first epidemiological survey in 1937 indicated that infection rate was as high as 85% among people in the Northern and Eastern parts of the Delta. Following construction of the Aswan Dam, basin irrigation is converted to perennial irrigation system, and this has significantly reduced the infection.\n\n \n"}

It was first described in 1988 in Peninsular Malaysia and appears to be a zooenotic infection. The species is named after the country of Malaysia. The natural vertebrate host is van Müller's rat (\"Rattus muelleri\"). The intermediate hosts are aquatic snails, \"Robertsiella kaporenisis\". Among \"Robertsiella kaporenisis\" are two other \"Roberstiella\" species.\n\nAmong humans exposed to this parasite the lifetime incidence appears to be 5-10%. The symptoms are unclear, because the symptoms have never been reported. The disease has been little studied and it is currently considered to be a relatively minor public health problem.\n\n\"Schistosoma malayensis\" is a member of the \"japonicum\" species complex along with \"Schistosoma japonicum\" and \"Schistosoma mekongi\". While the three species are grouped together because of their similarity, \"Schistosoma malayensis\" is more closely related to \"Shistosoma mekongi\".\n\nSize is the only morphological difference compared to its natural host possibly due to host-induced variation. The adult \"S. malayensis\" is typically smaller than \"S. mekongi\" and \"S. japonicum\".\n\n\"S. malayensis\" eggs have been found in liver granulomas, embedded within dense, fibrous tissue. The eggs of \"S. malayensis\" have a thin-walled, yellowish shell. The eggs contain miracidia and are approximately 50 μm long × 28 μm wide. The ova is not operculated and has no bipolar plugs and the thin covering was not striated.\n\nSerologic surveys for schistosomiasis due to \"S. malayensis\" indicate of 3.9% prevalence in rural populations. It was unsuccessful at adapting to human host. Infected rodents are often found near snail habitats. Infections in humans are unlikely and are considered rare. Humans are most likely to become infected while fishing or canoeing on small streams.\n\nFreshwater snails (\"Robertsiella\" sp.) act as an intermediate host for \"S. malayensis\", that can infect humans and other mammals when cercaria are released from the snail and eventually get in contact with the definitive host. \"Robertsiella\" species are Caenogastropoda snails of the family Pomatiopsidae. This species is known to be located in limestone areas in the foothills of the mountain chains of Kedah and Perak States in West Malaysia.\n\nThe final or definitive mammalian hosts include \"Rattus muelleri\" and \"R. tiomanicus\". \"R. muelleri\" has been found in lowland secondary, and disturbed primary forests in wet conditions in Western Malaysia. \"R. muelleri\" is often found near river banks due to the species prioritization of crustaceans and mollusks over other food sources, such as insects. The predation of mollusks by \"R. muelleri\" allows \"S. malayensis\" a route into its definitive host. It is possible infected rodents defecate in bodies of water they hunt for prey in, maintaining a constant contamination with \"S. malayensis\" eggs and continuing the life cycle.\n"}

As a producer, Scott is noted for his work with David Bowie, Supertramp, Devo, Kansas, the Tubes, Ronnie Montrose, Level 42, among others.\n\nScott was also influential in the evolution of jazz rock, pioneering a harder rock sound through his work with Mahavishnu Orchestra, Stanley Clarke, Billy Cobham, Dixie Dregs, and Jeff Beck.\n\nScott was born in South London, and grew up listening to 78 rpm records of artists like Elvis Presley, Bill Haley, and Eddie Cochran on a wind-up gramophone. In 1959 at the age of 12, he received a tape recorder which he used to record material from the BBC Light Programme Pick of the Pops, but it was an episode of \"Here Come the Girls\", an Alan Freeman-hosted TV show about British female pop artists in recording studios, that first focused Scott's career aspirations as a recording engineer when it featured Carol Deene singing in a recording session from the point of view of Studio Two at Abbey Road Studios, where Malcolm Addey was behind the recording console.\n\nOn Saturday, 18 January 1964, Scott wrote letters inquiring about recording engineer job openings and mailed them to several London recording studios. Three days later he was contacted by Abbey Road Studios and subsequently interviewed and offered a position the following day. Scott began working the following Monday at the age of just 16. He received the traditional Abbey Road studio training under engineers like Malcolm Addey and Norman Smith. His first job was in the tape library, and within six months he was promoted to 2nd engineer (known then as a \"button pusher\"), where his first session was on side two of the Beatles' album \"A Hard Days Night\".\n\nAmong the other artists he worked with as a button pusher were Manfred Mann (\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\" was the first English number 1 hit he worked on), Peter and Gordon, the Hollies, Judy Garland, Johnny Mathis, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, and Peter Sellers.\n\nAfter a short time as an assistant engineer, Scott was promoted to \"cutting\" (known as mastering today), where he spent approximately two years cutting not only acetates for artists, but the masters for many of the hits that EMI also distributed at the time, including the American Motown catalogue.\n\nIn September 1967, Scott was promoted to engineer, where his first session was with the Beatles on their song \"Your Mother Should Know\". His first orchestral recording session came a few days later when he recorded the strings, brass and choir for the band's song \"I Am the Walrus\". During his time with the Beatles, Scott also worked on the songs \"Lady Madonna\", \"Hello, Goodbye\" and \"Hey Jude\", as well as \"The Beatles\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour\" albums. Among the notable songs from those albums that he worked on are \"The Fool on the Hill\", \"Glass Onion\", \"Helter Skelter\", \"Birthday\", \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Not Guilty\", the last of which was recorded for the White Album, but not included on it.\n\nAs an engineer at Abbey Road, Scott also worked with numerous other artists including the Jeff Beck Group, Pink Floyd, the Pretty Things, Scaffold and Mary Hopkin. In late 1969, shortly after completion of the Procol Harum album \"A Salty Dog\", he left Abbey Road for Trident Studios, at the suggestion of Elton John and producer Gus Dudgeon.\n\nScott soon found himself working with the Beatles again on their various solo projects, including John Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Cold Turkey\", Ringo Starr's \"It Don't Come Easy\" and George Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\".\n\nAfter a short time he took over the mixing of Elton John's \"Madman Across the Water\", after fellow Trident engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable suffered severe injuries in a traffic accident. That led him to work on John's \"Honky Château\" and \"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player\".\n\nAlso during this period he reconnected with David Bowie (he had previously worked on Bowie's \"Man of Words/Man of Music\" and \"Man Who Sold the World\" albums) on a project with Bowie protege Freddie Burretti. By this time Scott wanted to move into production, and Bowie said he was about to start a new album and didn't feel comfortable about solely producing himself, so it was agreed that they would co-produce what became \"Hunky Dory\". After the album was completed, but before it was even released, work began on his next album – \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" – again with Scott as co-producer. Scott went on to co-produce Bowie's \"Aladdin Sane\" and \"Pin Ups\" albums, as well as the little-seen \"Midnight Special\" television program episode \"The 1980 Floor Show\".\n\nDuring his time at Trident Studios, Scott also teamed up with Supertramp for \"Crime of the Century\" in what amounted to a breakthrough album nearly everywhere in the world except the United States. While most albums were routinely recorded in two weeks at the time, \"Crime of the Century\" was an exception, taking a painstaking six months, as Scott and the group sought a precision to the recording and mixing not found in much of the music recorded at the time. \"Crime of the Century\" is regularly mentioned as one of the top albums of all time, and was often used as a stereo demonstration record in music stores. The album featured two songs that still get substantial radio play today: \"Dreamer\" and \"Bloody Well Right.\"\n\nThe follow-up, \"Crisis? What Crisis?\", attempted to reach those same sonic heights, but it was subject to the limitations of a timetable, because Supertramp had gained a measure of stardom, and a release date and tour had already been planned. The album was also recorded at other studios besides Trident, including Studio D at A&M Records in Hollywood, the Who's Ramport Studios, and the now defunct Scorpio Studios.\n\nOther artists Scott worked with while at Trident included America, Harry Nilsson, Lou Reed, Rick Wakeman, the Rolling Stones, Al Kooper and Lindisfarne, as well as the Clio-winning Coca-Cola ad \"I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke\".\n\nScott also helped change the sound of the cross-pollination genre known as jazz rock or progressive jazz, adding a much harder edge rock sound (especially to the drums) to albums like Mahavishnu Orchestra's \"Birds of Fire\", \"Visions of the Emerald Beyond\" and \"The Lost Trident Sessions\", Billy Cobham's \"Spectrum\", \"Crosswinds\", \"Total Eclipse\", and \"Shabazz\", Stanley Clarke's \"Stanley Clarke\" and \"School Days\", and Jeff Beck's \"There and Back\".\n\nAlthough not strictly jazz nor progressive rock, he also worked with the southern fusion band Dixie Dregs (\"What If\" and \"Night of the Living Dregs\") and the symphonic progressive band Happy the Man (\"Happy the Man and Crafty Hands\").\n\nAfter spending three months in Hollywood recording Supertramp on the A&M lot, and receiving more production work from the company as a result of the success of Supertramp, Scott decided to permanently move his family to Los Angeles in 1976, just by chance renting a house across the street from Frank Zappa. Subsequent to that move he produced albums with David Batteau, the Tubes, Devo, Kansas, Level 42, Dada and others.\n\nAt the behest of Zappa's wife Gail, Scott was asked to check out a demo featuring ex-members of Frank's band, Terry Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo, along with Bozzio's wife Dale, who had formed a band eventually to be named Missing Persons. With Scott at the helm, and thanks to massive airplay from the fledgling rock radio station KROQ, the band went on to record one of the biggest selling EPs ever, which eventually led to a deal with Capitol Records, which then released their first album, entitled \"Spring Session M\". When the group was not able to find a suitable manager, Scott also assumed that role.\n\nAfter \"artistic differences\" caused a split, he went on to produce and manage other acts including Christine in the Attic and Cock Robin, although neither went on to achieve the level of success of Missing Persons.\n\nScott's previous relationship with Warren Cuccurullo, who went on to join Duran Duran, led to his mixing an \"MTV Unplugged\" episode, as well as doing engineering work on the \"Thank You\" and \"Pop Trash\" albums.\n\nIn 2000, Scott reunited with former Beatle George Harrison to work on the reissue of his catalogue, included the huge hit \"All Things Must Pass\". He was also responsible for the organization of Harrison's entire tape library during that period.\n\nScott continues to be active in the studio and gives talks around the world. In 2012, he released a memoir entitled \"Abbey Road To Ziggy Stardust\", co-written with Bobby Owsinski and published by Alfred Music Publishing.\n\nScott is currently a Senior Professor at Leeds Beckett University's School of Film, Music and Performing Arts.\n\nOriginally from South London, Scott resided in Los Angeles from 1976 to 2013, then relocated to Nashville. In 2016, Scott and his wife, Cheryl, moved to Hampsthwaite near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in the UK.\n\n\nSelected engineering and production credits:\n\n"}

The first two generations of the Quest were a joint venture with Ford, which marketed a rebadged variant as the Mercury Villager. The vans debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. However, it is still sold in Japan. Each version of the Quest rode a platform derived from that of the Nissan Maxima.\n\nBoth vehicles were initially powered by the 3.0 L Nissan VG30E V6 engine until 1998, when the Quest received the 3.3 L version of the same engine and a few minor updates, including a driver side sliding door, and grille and rear redesigns. The Quest was completely redesigned for 2004, while the Villager was discontinued and replaced with the Freestar-based Mercury Monterey. The third generation model was built on the FF-L platform, which it shares with the Altima, Maxima, Teana, and Murano. It also shares the 3.5 L VQ engine with those cars. The fourth generation model is built on the same platform as the 2011 Nissan Elgrand.\n\nIn 1987, Ford and Nissan entered a joint agreement to develop an all-new vehicle to compete in the minivan segment scheduled for 1991. Development officially began later that year under the codename VX54, with the final designs being chosen in 1989. Prototypes went into initial testing in 1990 at Ford and Nissan test tracks, later real-world testing throughout 1991, with development concluding at the end of that year. On January 6, 1992, the 1993 Nissan Quest was unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Unusually, its design patents were subsequently filed by design chief Thomas H. Semple for Nissan Motor on March 5, 1992, rather than in advance of its introduction.\n\nThe first Nissan Quest rolled off the production line on April 14, 1992 at the Avon, Ohio plant sourced from Japanese production. While assembly took place at Ohio Assembly, initial production began in Japan and later at NMMC that August. NMMC production began in June 1992 on the main body components, with engine assembly beginning in August. The Quest was launched in September 1992 and sold 1,358 units during its first month.\nThe Quest was a successor to the Nissan Axxess, which was sold in the United States only in 1990 (ended production in 1989) and in Canada from 1990–1995. It also replaced the rear-wheel drive Vanette, also discontinued in 1990. The Quest was initially powered by Nissan's 3.0 L VG30E SOHC engine that made and . For a short time, the Quest was sold in Japan in a right hand drive configuration at \"Nissan Bluebird Store\" locations, but due to the engine displacement and exterior dimensions exceeding Japanese Government dimension regulations sales were limited and cancelled after the facelifted version was released in 1996.\n\nFord required that Nissan make some design changes to the VG30E before they would agree to use it in the Villager and Quest. Changes included the addition of an oil level sensor and relocating the oil filter assembly for better access. The engine was also modified for the Quest and Villager to become a non-interference design: if the timing belt were to break, the pistons wouldn't come in contact with any open valves in the cylinders. The Quest was available as XE or GXE models. Because of manufacturing issues, Nissan had an arrangement for Ford to assemble the minivan in North America, and in turn they were allowed to rebadge it and sell it under the Mercury brand as the Villager. Many of the interior parts, including the radio, heater controls and power windows controls were adapted from Ford, and were similar to the Ford Aerostar. This generation of the Quest and Villager was built at Ford's Ohio Assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio. The van shared the modified version of the VG30E from the U11, and early J30 Maximas, as well as the 4-speed automatic transmission from the Maxima.\nSeating was for 7, with a removable 2-seater bench in the middle, allowing the third row bench of 3 seats to slide up (either folded up for more room or down for passengers) behind the front for more rear cargo room. The third row seat was not removable however, and the system was not improved in the 1999 redesign (on which the model was not available in Canada), so newer fold-into-the-floor seats and lightweight buckets quickly eclipsed the system. In 1993, a driver's side airbag was made standard. A passenger airbag was later added in 1995 for the 1996 model year. That year saw the introduction of changes to the front and rear fascias, as well as headlights and tail lamps and the elimination of the motorized shoulder belts.\n\nFor 1999, the Quest was redesigned at Nissan Design America in San Diego, California, under Diane Allen, during 1993 and 1995. The production design by Shinken Tanaka was frozen in 1995 and design patents were filed at the Japan Patent Office. on November 2, 1995 under patent #1009611. The exterior was given a more aerodynamic look, and the driver's side sliding door was added (it had been absent in the three-door Quests from 1993 to 1998). The Quest also got a power boost via the 3.3 L VG33E SOHC engine, making and of torque. With the new 3.3-liter engine, the 1999 Nissan Quest had a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 11.1 seconds. The XE trim was discontinued and the GXE was moved as the base model. Two new trim levels were also introduced: the top-of-the-line GLE and the sport model SE. This Nissan Quest model became the first Nissan minivan with four doors since the 1995 Nissan Axxess.\n\nThe 2000 Nissan Quest was tested in a competition organized by \"Car and Driver\" against the Chevrolet Venture, Toyota Sienna, Mazda MPV, and Chrysler Voyager. The Quest performed poorly and placed fifth out of the five minivans tested; the editors cited a lengthy braking distance of 220 feet from 70 mph and inflexible seating configurations (the third-row seat was not removable) as downsides, while the Quest's performance and nimble handling were cited as advantages over its competitors.\n\nIn August 2000, the 2001 Quest received various minor improvements. Styling front and rear was updated, along with new alloy wheels on all models. The entry-level GXE gained a rear stabilizer bar, while the SE received acceleration-sensitive strut valving and a strut tower brace. New interior gauges and fabrics as well as a 130-watt sound system were standard on SE and GLE. Luxury GLE models also received an in-dash six-CD changer and a wood and leather-trimmed steering wheel. An optional overhead family entertainment system replaced the former floor-mounted model, though it could still be specified for SEs and GLEs equipped with a sunroof. Front seatbelts were given pretensioners. The 2001 Quest was also slightly longer, with more cargo space than the initial models. The 2002 Nissan Quest was not sold in Canada. The Quest would not return to Canada until the third-generation model arrived in 2003.\n\nBy the end of this generation, both Honda and Toyota marketed solely long-wheelbase minivans. In 2001, \"Automotive News\" reported that 29,232 Nissan Quests were sold, representing a 32% decrease from the previous year. No Quest models were marketed for the 2003 model year.\nDevelopment began in 1999 on the V42 alongside a proposed Ford replacement. In 2000, decisions were made by Ford and Nissan to abandon the joint venture, as both the Windstar and Quest replacements were in initial development and the design process. As a result, Ford made plans to build a Mercury variant on the Windstar (WIN-96) successor's platform due in 2003 and Nissan on the Altima and Maxima platform. The design by Alfonso Albaisa was chosen in late 2000, with a concept vehicle being presented in January 2002 at NAIAS as a thinly veiled preview. Design patents were filed on December 27, 2002 and registered under D483,297 December 9, 2003. The production third generation Quest was unveiled for the 2004 model year at the 2003 North American International Auto Show using the Nissan Altima and Nissan Maxima platform, Nissan's FF-L platform, in a package slightly longer than the Chrysler long-wheelbase minivans. Production was moved to a new plant in Canton, Mississippi and started on May 27, 2003.\n\nThe Quest is powered by the 3.5 L VQ35DE engine from the Maxima, Altima, and others. The 2004 Quest recorded a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 8.8 seconds. In the Quest, it produces and of torque. The Quest has a flat folding rear bench and the two middle chairs fold nearly flat into the floor. The interior volume is .\n\nThe third generation Quest features an unusual moonroof glass arrangement, and positions for 2 DVD screens with aux input, when the VHS shaped IWCC Xl system was discontinued. Also featured in the SE model were side front airbags, curtain airbags for all rows, VSC (Vehicle Stability Control), Traction Control, dual power doors and power rear hatch, Bose audio with RDS and folding second row seats, dual climate control, and rear backup sensors. Nissan redesigned the front grille and the dashboard for the 2007 model.

Its opposite is Italophilia.\n\nAnti-Italianism arose among some Americans as an effect of the large-scale immigration of Italians to the United States during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. The majority of Italian immigrants to the United States arrived in waves in the early-twentieth century, many of them from agrarian backgrounds. The large majority of the Italian immigrants were Catholic, as opposed to the nation's Protestant majority. Because the immigrants often lacked formal education, and competed with earlier immigrants for lower-paying jobs and housing, hostility existed toward them. The established Protestant Americans of Northern European ancestry aggressively displayed and acted upon ethnocentric chauvinism and racism against Italian immigrants, especially in the American South, the population there being overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon and Protestant. In reaction to the large-scale immigration from southern and eastern Europe, Congress passed legislation (Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and Immigration Act of 1924) restricting immigration from those regions, but not from Northern European countries.\n\nAnti-Italian prejudice was sometimes associated with the anti-Catholic tradition that existed in the United States, which was inherited as a result of Protestant/Catholic European competition and wars, which had been fought between Protestants and Catholics over the preceding three centuries. When the United States was founded, it inherited the anti-Catholic, anti-papal animosity of its original Protestant settlers. Anti-Catholic sentiments in the U.S. reached a peak in the 19th century when the Protestant population became alarmed by the large number of Catholics who were immigrating to the United States. This was due in part to the standard tensions that arise between native-born citizens and immigrants. The resulting anti-Catholic nativist movement, which achieved prominence in the 1840s, led to hostility that resulted in mob violence, including the burning of Catholic property. The Italian immigrants inherited this anti-Catholic hostility upon arrival; however, unlike some of the other Catholic immigrant groups, they generally did not bring with them priests and other religious who could help ease their transition into American life. To remedy this situation, Pope Leo XIII dispatched a contingent of priests, nuns and brothers of the Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo and other orders (among which was Sister Francesca Cabrini), who helped establish hundreds of parishes to serve the needs of the Italian communities, such as Our Lady of Pompeii in New York City.\n\nSome of the early 20th-century immigrants from Italy brought with them a political disposition toward socialism and anarchism. This was a reaction to the economic and political conditions which they had experienced in Italy. Such men as Arturo Giovannitti, Carlo Tresca, and Joe Ettor were in the forefront of organising Italians and other immigrant labourers in demanding better working conditions and shorter working hours in the mining, textile, garment, construction and other industries. These efforts often resulted in strikes, which sometimes erupted into violence between the strikers and strike-breakers. The anarchy movement in the United States at that time was responsible for bombings in major cities, and attacks on officials and law enforcement. As a result of the association of some with the labour and anarchy movements, Italian Americans were branded as labor agitators and radicals by many of the business owners and the wealthier class of the time, which resulted in anti-Italian sentiments.\n\nThe vast majority of Italian immigrants worked hard and lived honest lives, as documented by police statistics of the early-twentieth century in Boston and New York City. Italian immigrants had an arrest rate which was no greater than those of other major immigrant groups. As late as 1963, James W. Vander Zander noted that the rate of criminal convictions among Italian immigrants was less than that among American-born whites. \n\nA criminal element which was active in some of the Italian immigrant communities which were located in the large eastern cities used extortion, intimidation and threats in order to extract protection money from the wealthier immigrants and shop owners (known as the Black Hand racket), and it was also involved in other illegal activities as well. When the Fascists came to power in Italy, they made the destruction of the Mafia in Sicily a high priority (Sicilian Mafia during the Mussolini regime). Hundreds fled to the United States in the 1920s and 1930s in order to avoid prosecution.\n\nWhen the United States enacted Prohibition in 1920, the restrictions proved to be an economic windfall for those in the Italian-American community who were already involved in illegal activities, as well as those who had fled from Sicily. They smuggled liquor into the country, wholesaled and sold it through a network of outlets and speakeasies. While members of other ethnic groups were also deeply involved in these illegal bootlegging activities, and the associated violence between groups, Italian Americans were among the most notorious. Because of this, Italians became associated with the prototypical gangster in the minds of many, which had a long-lasting effect on the Italian-American image.\n\nThe experiences of Italian immigrants in North American countries were notably different than those in South American countries, where many of them immigrated in large numbers. Italians were key in developing countries such as: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. They quickly joined the middle and upper classes in those countries. In the U.S., Italian Americans initially encountered an established Protestant-majority Northern European culture. For a time, they were viewed mainly as construction and industrial workers, chefs, plumbers, or other blue collar workers. Like the Irish before them, many entered police and fire departments of major cities. \nAfter the American Civil War, during the labour shortage that occurred as the South converted to free labour, planters in southern states recruited Italians to come to the United States and work, mainly as agricultural workers and labourers. Many soon found themselves the victims of prejudice, economic exploitation, and they were sometimes victims of violence. Anti-Italian stereotypes abounded during this period as a means of justifying the maltreatment of the immigrants. The plight of the Italian immigrant agricultural workers in Mississippi was so serious that the Italian embassy became involved in investigating their mistreatment in cases that were studied for peonage. Later waves of Italian immigrants inherited these same virulent forms of discrimination and stereotyping which, by then, had become ingrained in the American consciousness.\n\nOne of the largest mass lynchings in American history was of eleven Italians in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1891. The city had been the destination for numerous Italian immigrants. Nineteen Italians who were thought to have assassinated police chief David Hennessy were arrested and held in the Parish Prison. Nine were tried, resulting in six acquittals and three mistrials. The next day, a mob stormed the prison and killed eleven men, none of whom had been convicted, and some of whom had not been tried. Afterward, the police arrested hundreds of Italian immigrants, on the false pretext that they were all criminals. Teddy Roosevelt, not yet president, famously said the lynching was indeed \"a rather good thing\". John M. Parker helped organize the lynch mob, and in 1911 was elected as governor of Louisiana. He described Italians as \"just a little worse than the Negro, being if anything filthier in their habits, lawless, and treacherous\".\n\nIn 1899, in Tallulah, Louisiana, three Italian-American shopkeepers were lynched because they had treated blacks in their shops the same as whites. A vigilante mob hanged five Italian Americans: the three shopkeepers and two bystanders.\n\nIn 1920 two Italian immigrants, Sacco and Vanzetti, were tried for robbery and murder in Boston, Massachusetts. Many historians agree that Sacco and Vanzetti were subjected to a mishandled trial, and the judge, jury, and prosecution were biased against them because of their anarchist political views and Italian immigrant status. Judge Webster Thayer called Sacco and Vanzetti \"Bolsheviki!\" and said he would \"get them good and proper\". In 1924 Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer: \"Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day?\" the judge said. Despite worldwide protests, Sacco and Vanzetti were eventually executed. Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis declared August 23, 1977, the 50th anniversary of their execution, as Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti Memorial Day. His proclamation, issued in English and Italian, stated that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that \"any disgrace should be forever removed from their names.\" He did not pardon them, because that would imply they were guilty.\n\nAnti-Italianism was part of the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic ideology of the revived Ku Klux Klan (KKK) after 1915; the white supremacist and nativist group targeted Italians and other Southern Europeans, seeking to preserve the supposed dominance of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. During the early 20th century, the KKK became active in northern and midwestern cities, where social change had been rapid due to immigration and industrialization. It was not limited to the South. It reached a peak of membership and influence in 1925. A hotbed of anti-Italian KKK activity developed in Southern New Jersey in the mid-1920s. In 1933, there was a mass protest against Italian immigrants in Vineland, New Jersey, where Italians made up 20% of the city population. The KKK eventually lost all of its power in Vineland, and left the city.\n\nSince the early decades of the 20th century, Italian Americans have been portrayed with stereotypical characterizations. Italian Americans in contemporary U.S. society have actively objected to pervasive negative stereotyping in the mass media. Stereotyping of Italian-Americans as being associated with organized crime has been a consistent feature of movies, such as \"The Godfather\" (all three works in the series), \"GoodFellas\" and \"Casino\", and TV programs such as \"The Sopranos\". Such stereotypes of Italian Americans are reinforced by the frequent replay of these movies and series on cable and network TV. Video and board games, and TV and radio commercials with Mafia themes also reinforce this stereotype. The entertainment media has stereotyped the Italian American community as tolerant of violent, sociopathic gangsters. Other notable stereotypes portray Italian Americans as overly aggressive and prone to violence. MTV's series \"Jersey Shore\" was considered offensive by the Italian-American group UNICO.\n\nA comprehensive study of Italian-American culture on film, conducted from 1996 to 2001, by the Italic Institute of America, revealed the extent of stereotyping in media. More than two-thirds of the 2,000 films assessed in the study portray Italian Americans in a negative light. Nearly 300 films featuring Italian Americans as mobsters have been produced since \"The Godfather\" (1972), an average of nine per year.\n\nAccording to the Italic Institute of America:\n\nThe mass media has consistently ignored five centuries of Italian American history, and has elevated what was never more than a minute subculture to the dominant Italian American culture.\n\nAccording to recent FBI statistics, Italian-American organized crime members and associates number approximately 3,000. Given an Italian-American population estimated to be approximately 18 million, the study concludes that only one in 6,000 has any involvement with organized crime.\n\nAn early manifestation of Anti-Italianism in Britain was in 1820, at the time when King George IV sought to dissolve his marriage to Caroline of Brunswick. A sensational proceeding, the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820, was held at the House of Lords in an effort to prove Caroline's adultery; since she had been living in Italy, many prosecution witnesses were from among her servants. The prosecution's reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian prejudice in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs, and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal. Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury.\n\nAnti-Italianism broke out again, in a more sustained way, a century later. After Benito Mussolini's alliance with Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, there was a growing hostility toward everything Italian in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe British media ridiculed the Italian capacity to fight in a war. A comic strip, which began running in 1938 in the British comic \"The Beano\", was entitled \"Musso the Wop\". The strip featured Mussolini as an arrogant buffoon.\n\n\"Wigs on the Green\" was a novel by Nancy Mitford, first published in 1935. It was a merciless satire of British Fascism and the Italians living in the United Kingdom who supported it. The book is notable for lampooning the political enthusiasms of Mitford's sister Diana Mosley, and her links with some Italians in Great Britain who promoted the British Union of Fascists of Oswald Mosley.\n\nFurthermore, the announcement of Benito Mussolini's decision to side with Adolf Hitler's Germany in spring 1940 had a devastating effect. By order of UK Parliament, all \"aliens\" were to be interned, although there were few active fascists. The majority of the Italians in Great Britain had lived in the country peacefully for many years, and had even fought side by side with British soldiers in the First World War. Some had married British women and even taken British citizenship.\n\nThis anti-Italian feeling led to a night of nationwide riots against the Italian communities in June 1940. The Italians were now seen as a national security threat linked to the feared British fascism movement, and Winston Churchill instructed \"collar the lot!\". Thousands of Italian men between the ages of 17 and 60 were arrested after his speech. They were transported to camps across the country.\n\nAdolf Hitler acknowledged the ancient history of the Roman civilization. He regarded the Italians as more artistic but less industrious than the Germanic population. The fact that Kingdom of Italy \"stabbed the German Empire in the back\" by siding with the allies in the First World War was not brought up (Treaty of London, 1915). \n\nDuring World War II, the United States and Great Britain treated Italian alien nationals in their countries as potential enemies. Hundreds of Italian citizens, suspected by ethnicity of potential loyalty to Italy, were put in internment camps in the U.S. and Canada. Thousands more Italian citizens in the U.S., suspected of loyalty to Italy, were placed under surveillance. Joe DiMaggio's father, who lived in San Francisco, had his boat and house confiscated. Unlike Japanese Americans, Italian Americans and Italian Canadians never received reparations from their respective governments, but President Bill Clinton made a public declaration admitting the U.S. government's misjudgement in the internment.\n\nBecause of Benito Mussolini's conquest of Ethiopia and Italy's alliance with Nazi Germany, in the United Kingdom popular feeling developed against all the Italians in the country. The steamship SS \"Arandora Star\" was torpedoed by German submarines on 2 July 1940 off the coast of Ireland. This resulted in the deaths of 446 British-Italians who were being deported as enemy aliens.\n\nDuring and after World War II, much British propaganda was directed against Italian military performance, usually expressing a stereotype of the \"incompetent Italian soldier\". Historians have documented that the Italian Army suffered defeats due to its being poorly prepared for major combat as a result of Mussolini's refusal to heed warnings by Italian Army commanders. Objective World War II accounts show that, despite having to rely in many cases on outdated weapons, Italian troops frequently fought with great valor and distinction, especially well trained and equipped units such as the Bersaglieri, Folgore and Alpini.\n\nBias includes both implicit assumptions, evident in Knox's title \"The Sources of Italy's Defeat in 1940: Bluff or Institutionalized Incompetence?\", and the selective use of sources. Also see Sullivan's \"The Italian Armed Forces\". Sims, in \"The Fighter Pilot\", ignored the Italians, while D'Este in \"World War II in the Mediterranean\" shaped his reader's image of Italians by citing a German comment that Italy's surrender was \"the basest treachery\". Further, he discussed Allied and German commanders but ignored Messe, who commanded the Italian First Army, which held off both the U.S. Second Corps and the British Eighth Army in Tunisia.\n\nIn his article, \"Anglo-American Bias and the Italo-Greek War\" (1994), Sadkovich writes:\n\nKnox and other Anglo-American historians have not only selectively used Italian sources, they have gleaned negative observations and racist slurs and comments from British, American, and German sources and then presented them as objective depictions of Italian political and military leaders, a game that if played in reverse would yield some interesting results regarding German, American, and British competence.\n\nSadkovich also states that\n\nsuch a fixation on Germany and such denigrations of Italians not only distort analysis, they also reinforce the misunderstandings and myths that have grown up around the Greek theater and allow historians to lament and debate the impact of the Italo-Greek conflict on the British and German war efforts, yet dismiss as unimportant its impact on the Italian war effort. Because Anglo-American authors start from the assumption that Italy's war effort was secondary in importance to that of Germany, they implicitly, if unconsciously, deny even the possibility of a 'parallel war' long before Italian setbacks in late 1940, because they define Italian policy as subordinate to German from the very beginning of the war. Alan Levine even goes most authors one better by dismissing the whole Mediterranean theater as irrelevant, but only after duly scolding Mussolini for 'his imbecilic attack on Greece'.\n\nFormer Italian communities once thrived in Italy's African colonies of Eritrea, Somalia and Libya, and in the areas at the borders of the Kingdom of Italy. In the aftermath of the end of imperial colonies and other political changes, many ethnic Italians were violently expelled from these areas, or left under threat of violence.\n\nLibya and Yugoslavia have shown high levels of anti-Italianism since WWII, as illustrated by the following manifestations:\n\n\nSome minor forms of antiitalianism showed up in Ethiopia and Somalia in the late 1940s, as happened with the Somali nationalist rebellion against the Italian colonial administration that culminated in violent confrontation in January 1948 (). 54 Italians (mostly women and children) died in the ensuing political riots in Mogadishu and several coastal towns.\n\nNational organizations which have been active in combatting media stereotyping and defamation of Italian Americans are: Order Sons of Italy in America, Unico National, National Italian American Foundation and the Italic Institute of America. Four Internet-based organizations are: Annotico Report, the Italian-American Discussion Network,\nItalianAware\nand the Italian American One Voice Coalition.\n\n\n"}

It also serves a small portion of Brays Oaks. In unincorporated Harris County, Alief ISD serves Wingate, portions of the Mission Bend CDP, and Enclave Crescent Park Village . The Alief ISD area is a part of the Houston Community College System tax base.\n\nIn 1894, Jacamiah Seaman Daughtery founded the town of Dairy. Until 1906, Addicks, Barker, and Dairy constituted a single School District. From 1906 to 1917, Alief was a Common School District known as Dairy School District #46. In 1917, the district was renamed Alief (since the community was renamed after Alief Ozelda Magee, its postmistress). Alief had only one school until a separate elementary school, Alief Elementary School (now Youens Elementary School), was built in 1964. Bonds passed in the 1960s caused the first modern campuses to open.\n\nIn 2011 the Brays Oaks district expanded. A small portion of Alief ISD became a part of the district.\n\nThe district offers prekindergarten to children meeting set criteria. To qualify for enrollment in a prekindergarten program, children must be 4 years old by the district's cut-off date. Children also must be either unable to speak or comprehend English or come from families which have a household income at or below the subsistence level as defined by the State Board of Education. Students between the ages of 5 years old and 21 may attend kindergarten through twelfth grade in the district. In addition, students who are between the ages of 21 and 26 may attend high school in the district to complete their high school diploma requirements.\n\nAs of the 2010-2011 school year, the appraised valuation of property in the district was $10,678,843,000. The maintenance tax rate was $0.113 and the bond tax rate was $0.022 per $100 of appraised valuation.\n\nIn 2011, the school district was rated \"recognized\" by the Texas Education Agency. Thirty-five percent of districts in Texas in 2011 received the same rating. No state accountability ratings will be given to districts in 2012.

Each house in the district is assigned to an elementary school, an intermediate school, and a middle school. Alief ISD has an alternative elementary zoning boundary set for bilingual students, as some Alief ISD elementary schools do not offer bilingual programs.\n\nHigh school attendance is chosen by a computer lottery, which can result in the student going to Alief Elsik High School, Alief Hastings High School or Alief Taylor High School. High school students may apply to attend Alief Kerr High School, a magnet school, or they can apply to the newest school Alief Early College High School, which in combination with HCC, provides students the chance to get their associate degree at the same time as their diploma.\n\nThere are four high schools in Houston and one in unincorporated Harris County, a total of five high schools in the district.\n\nRegular (zoned)\n\nMagnet \n\nThere are 4 middle schools in Houston and 2 in unincorporated Harris County, a total of 6 middle schools in the district.\n\nThere are 5 intermediate schools in Houston and 1 in unincorporated Harris County, a total of 6 intermediate schools in the district.\n\nThere are 20 elementary schools in Houston and 5 in unincorporated Harris County, a total of 25 elementary schools in the district.\n\nThere is one alternative school in Houston.\n\nIn addition to school campuses, the district has several other facilities for students, staff, and administrators.

Jessup\n\nMorris Ketchum Jessup (March 2, 1900 – April 20, 1959) had a Master of Science Degree in astronomy and, though employed for most of his life as an automobile-parts salesman and a photographer, is probably best remembered for his writings on UFOs.\n\nBorn near Rockville, Indiana, Jessup grew up with an interest in astronomy. He earned a bachelor of science degree in astronomy from The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1925 and, while working at the Lamont-Hussey Observatory, received a master of science degree in 1926. Though he began work on his doctorate in astrophysics, he ended his dissertation work in 1931 and never earned the higher degree. Nevertheless, he was sometimes referred to as \"Dr. Jessup\". He apparently dropped his career and studies in astronomy and worked for the rest of his life in a variety of jobs unrelated to science, although he is sometimes erroneously described as having been an instructor in astronomy and mathematics at the University of Michigan and Drake University.\n\nJessup has been referred to in ufological circles as \"probably the most original extraterrestrial hypothesiser of the 1950s\", and it has been said of him that he was \"educated in astronomy and archeology and had working experience in both.\" Actual evidence of an educational background in archaeology or archaeological field work is absent from Jessup's resume, but Jerome Clark reports that Jessup took part in archeological expeditions to the Yucatan and Peru in the 1920s. Jessup documented an expedition to Cuzco he took part in during 1930.\n\nJessup achieved some notoriety with his 1955 book \"The Case for the UFO\", in which he argued that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) represented a mysterious subject worthy of further study. Jessup speculated that UFOs were \"exploratory craft of \"solid\" and \"nebulous\" character.\" Jessup also \"linked ancient monuments with prehistoric superscience\"; years later similar claims were made by Erich von Däniken in \"Chariots of the Gods?\" in 1968 and other books.\n\nJessup wrote three further flying-saucer books, \"UFOs and the Bible\", \"The UFO Annual\" (both 1956), and \"The Expanding Case for the UFO\" (1957). The latter suggested that transient lunar phenomena were somehow related to UFOs in the earth's skies. Jessup's main flying-saucer scenario came to resemble that of the Shaver Hoax perpetrated by the science-fiction magazine editor Raymond A. Palmer—namely, that \"good\" and \"bad\" groups of space aliens were/are meddling with terrestrial affairs. Like most of the writers on flying saucers and the so-called contactees that emerged during the 1950s, Jessup displayed familiarity with the alternative mythology of human prehistory developed by Helena P. Blavatsky's cult of Theosophy, which included the mythical lost continents of Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria.\n\nJessup attempted to make a living writing on the subject of UFOs, but his follow-up books did not sell well and his publisher rejected several other manuscripts. In 1958 his wife left him, and his friends described him as being somewhat unstable when he traveled to New York City. After returning to Florida, he was involved in a serious car accident and was slow to recover, apparently increasing his despondency. On April 19, 1959, Jessup contacted Manson Valentine and arranged to meet with him the next day, claiming to have made a breakthrough regarding an event known as the Philadelphia Experiment. However, on April 20, 1959, Jessup was found dead in Dade County, Florida, with a hose between the exhaust pipe and a rear window of the vehicle, filling the car with toxic exhaust fumes. The death was ruled a suicide. Some people believed that \"The circumstances of Jessup's apparent suicide remain mysterious\" and conspiracy theorists contended that it was connected to his knowledge of the \"Philadelphia Experiment\". Although some friends claimed that he possibly had been driven to suicide by the \"Allende Case,\" other friends said that an extremely depressed Jessup had been discussing suicide with his friends for several months before committing suicide.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He has also worked as the first base coach for the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nAfter attending College of the Redwoods in Eureka, California, Iorg was drafted in the 8th round (181st overall) in the 1973 Major League Baseball Draft by the New York Yankees. He was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays from the Yankees organization in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. He made his MLB debut on April 9, 1978.In his debut season in 1978, he wore uniform number 29. He was in the minor leagues in 1979, and in 1980, he was recalled to the Blue Jays wearing uniform number 16 until his retirement.\n\nGarth was called up to the Jays in the 1978 season and played 19 games mostly at second base. He played nine seasons for the Jays, batting .258/.282/.347 with 20 home runs in 931 games played. He was a utility player who spent most of his career as the right-handed half of a third-base platoon with Rance Mulliniks called \"Mullinorg\". During his major league career, he also appeared at 2B, 1B, SS, DH and OF. Although he was an emergency catcher, he never played this position at the major league level. After he retired, he played shortstop for the Bradenton Explorers in the Senior Professional Baseball Association. Iorg was most recognizable for his strange batting stance, on the toes of his front foot and leaning back toward the catcher as the ball was being pitched. Usually a singles hitter, Iorg had the highest batting average (.313) and a .469 slugging percentage on the Blue Jays in their division-winning 1985 season.

Over the years, a number of spin-off games based on the series have also been developed by multiple companies. While the main series consists of RPGs, spin-off games encompass other genres, such as action role-playing, puzzle, fighting, and digital pet games. Most \"Pokémon\" video games have been developed exclusively for Nintendo handhelds, video game consoles, and PCs dating from the Game Boy to the current generation of video game consoles.\n\n\"Pokédex 3D\" is an app available for download from the Nintendo eShop. It is a Pokédex, which displays information on Pokémon from \"Black\" and \"White\" as well as a 3D model. Only a few Pokémon are initially available, and more can be unlocked through means such as SpotPass and StreetPass and AR cards.\n\nOn April 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that there would be a National Pokédex version called \"Pokédex 3D Pro\". It was released in Japan on the Nintendo eShop on July 14, 2012, and internationally on November 8, 2012. Unlike the original, the \"Pro\" edition of the app is not free, and all Pokémon are available from the start rather than unlocking them over time, although some that are not available can be unlocked by entering a special code on the official website. In addition, it has new background music, modes, more scenes and backgrounds and features the voice for the name of every Pokémon. The \"Pro\" edition replaced the original free app as it was removed from the eShop on June 17, 2012 in Japan and on October 1, 2012 internationally. An official iOS version was released on November 15, 2012 but was delisted on November 30, 2015.\n\n\"Pokémon Bank\" is a mobile application available on the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS.

It is an online storage system which allows players to store up to 3000 Pokémon and access requires a stable internet connection. The app is free to download, but requires an annual fee in order to access the servers. \"Bank\" is compatible with \"Pokémon X\", \"Y\", \"Omega Ruby\", \"Alpha Sapphire\", \"Sun\", \"Moon\", \"Ultra Sun\" and \"Ultra Moon\" and the game's Pokémon Storage System. Pokémon holding items and a cosplay variant of Pikachu cannot be stored. The additional app \"Poké Transporter\" allows players to transfer Pokémon from \"Pokémon Black\", \"White\", \"Black 2\" and \"White 2\" and the Virtual Console releases of \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\". \"Pokémon Bank\" was later updated to add \"Poké Transporter\" capabilities for \"Gold\", \"Silver\", and \"Crystal\" as well.\n\nThe augmented reality mobile game \"Pokémon Go\" was released in July 2016 on both Android and iOS platforms. It utilizes internal GPS tracking system in order to find and catch Pokémon in real-time. The system places gyms and Pokéstops in predetermined locations (such as landmarks) throughout the world in order to get the player active and become a Pokémon trainer in real life. The Pokémon themselves spawn randomly, with some conditions; nocturnal Pokémon like Lunatone only spawn at night, and Magikarp spawn near water. Gyms are used to battle and train Pokémon against other players in the area, and nearby PokéStops give free items when spun (they have a 5-minute cooldown per use). It originally featured the 151 original Generation 1 Pokémon. In February 2017, generation 2 Pokémon were added excluding the legendaries such as Suicune, Raikou, Entei, Celebi, Lugia, and Ho-Oh.

Their debut album \"Make It Come True\" was released in 1992 and contained four ARIA top 50 singles, including the #1 hit, \"Take It From Me\". The group also became recognised for its fashion sense, with their flower hats becoming a symbol of the band; at one point, they had their own clothing line.\n\nAfter the departure of lead vocalist Robyn Loau, the group changed its name to GF4.\n\nThree of the members — Jacqueline Cowell, Siobhánn Heidenreich and Melanie Alexander — first met while taking dance lessons at age three. Years later, they decided to form a pop group, and through their dance teacher Janice Breen, met Noel MacDonald, a singer, songwriter and jingle producer who saw promise in them. Two more singers were added to the group – Robyn Loau, who MacDonald saw singing at Wonderland Sydney Theme Park, and Lorinda Noble, who auditioned for the group. Singer and choreographer Kelley Abbey was also brought in to choreograph the group's dance moves. The quintet was signed to a deal with RCA Records Australia in 1991, after a year of self-promotion. The band were formed with the ambition of being both Australia and Asia's #1 girl band, with the band members, particularly Robyn Loau, undertaking extensive Japanese lessons.\n\nIn April 1992, the group released their debut single, \"Take It from Me\", which reached No. 1 on the ARIA chart. This was followed by \"Girl's Life\" (#15) and \"Without You\" (#18). In September 1992, Girlfriend released their debut studio album, \"Make It Come True\" which peaked at number 6 in Australia. \n\nIn April 1993, Girlfriend released \"Girl's Life\", a Japan-exclusive album, consisting of songs from \"Make It Come True\", mostly re-recorded with Japanese vocals.\n\nIn September 1993, Girlfriend released \"Heartbeat\", the lead single from their second studio album, before releasing \"It's Up to You\" in October 1993. The group's two studio albums, \"Make It Come True\" (1992) and \"It's Up to You\" (1993) were certified platinum and gold respectively in Australia.\n\nIn November, the group released a 4-track Japan-only extended play titled \"Magic\".\n\nIn 1994, after the group had returned from a tour of Europe and Japan, Loau left the group to start a solo career. She later enjoyed minor success with the hit \"Sick with Love\" which peaked at #21 on the ARIA Charts, and released an album, \"Malaria\". \n\nThe four remaining members renamed themselves as GF4. GF4 released two singles; the first, a cover version of the 1971 Grass Roots song \"Sooner or Later\", reached No. 11 on the ARIA singles charts. In 1995, Jacqui Cowell left the band and was replaced by future Bardot member, Belinda Chapple, who featured in the music video for GF4's second single, \"Need Love (To Make the Sex Right)\", filmed in a Sydney nightclub. The video featured band member Siobhann Heidenrich miming to Cowell's spoken lines in the opening to the song. The single narrowly missed the ARIA Top 100 singles chart, resulting in the debut album that GF4 had recorded in Los Angeles being shelved. \nGF4 did not release any further material as a band and split in 1996.\n\nOn 13 May 2007, the former five members of Girlfriend appeared on Channel 7's \"Where Are They Now?\" program. The five spoke about their time with Girlfriend and performed an a cappella rendition of \"Take It from Me\" for the live audience.\n\nA \"best-of\" compilation, \"Essential Girlfriend\", was scheduled for release in November 2010, but remains unreleased.\n\nIn November 2010, former member Melanie Alexander provided guest vocals on the song \"Falling for the Dance Floor\" with Australian DJ, Stonedog. The track appears on the compilation album \"Club Anthems Asia\", released through Hong Kong-based independent dance music label Volume Up Records.\n\nIn May 2017, Robyn Loau confirmed that the original members were reuniting for the 25th anniversary of their #1 hit \"Take It from Me\".\n\n\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music. Girlfriend received two nominations.\n"}

It is manufactured by General Mills in the United States and Cereal Partners (under the Nestlé brand) in other countries. Introduced in 1977, it was originally manufactured by Ralston Purina until they sold the trademark to General Mills in 1997, who soon after changed the recipe.\n\nDouble Chocolate Cookie Crisp was a double chocolate-flavored variety of Cookie Crisp introduced in 2007.\n\nPeanut Butter Cookie Crisp was also introduced. It has the taste of peanut butter cookies.\n\nIn July 2009, Cookie Crisp Sprinkles were introduced. They are vanilla cookies with small sprinkles on them. The cereal is said to be gluten free. In Summer 2009, Nestlé released new packaging for the UK version of Cookie Crisp with sprinkles.\n\nCookie Crisp Brownie was introduced in the U.K. in 2013, which has the flavor of brownies,\n\nThe cereal was once available in a vanilla wafer flavor as well.\n\nDuring his tenure as Cookie Crisp mascot, Cookie Jarvis was used on three versions of Cookie Crisp: Ralston’s Chocolate Chip Cookie Crisp, Vanilla Wafer Cookie Crisp, and Oatmeal Cookie Crisp.\n\nIn March 2018 Birthday Cake Cookie Crisp was introduced to the U.S. market.\n\nIn 1997, Ralston sold their cereal line to General Mills, who soon after changed the recipe, prompting many Cookie Crisp lovers to seek the original taste in knock-off and foreign brands.\n\nKeebler Cookie Crunch was introduced by Kellogg’s in 2008. This cereal has cookie pieces that represent Chips Deluxe and are strikingly similar to Cookie Crisp. It also includes round O shapes that represent Keebler’s popular fudge stripe cookies.\n\nIntroduced in 1977, the first Cookie Crisp mascot, Cookie Jarvis, was a wizard in the Merlin mold, who with one wave of his wand, magically turned cookie jars into cereal bowls, usually chanting rhyming incantations along with it. He was voiced by Lennie Weinrib.\n\nCookie Jarvis was joined by Cookie Crook, an anti-hero robber who attempts to steal the Cookie Crisp, in the mid-1980s, followed by his opponent Cookie Cop (full name Officer Crumb), a police officer (reminiscent of the Keystone Cops) with an Irish accent who thwarts the Cookie Crook's attempts to steal the Cookie Crisp.\n\nA typical ad would begin with the Cookie Crook attempting to steal the cereal from a live-action breakfast table; often he and the Cookie Cop were portrayed as no larger than mice, so their pictures on the cereal bowl were “life size\". The Crook would have some new gadget or scheme to steal the cereal, but then the Cookie Cop would arrive and save the kid’s cereal in the nick of time. Eventually, the format of the ads changed to full animation, and the duo was portrayed as the size of normal humans; an even more slapstick approach (similar to \"Looney Tunes\") was used in these commercials.\n\nIn 1990, the Cookie Crook was given a sidekick named Chip the Dog. Chip would howl the cereal's name (\"Coo-\"ooooooooooo\"kie Crisp!\") in each ad before he and his master were inevitably foiled by the Cookie Cop.\n\nAfter General Mills bought the Cookie Crisp trademark from Ralston in 1997, Chip continues to be the mascot with the Cookie Crook and Cookie Cop. In the format of the advertisements, Chip was a friendly pooch, no longer wearing a mask, who offered Cookie Crisp to a group of kids. Typically an adult would interfere on the grounds that cookies are not breakfast food. Near the end of the ads, the adults would change their minds once Chip gave them a taste of his Cookie Crisp.\n\nIn 2003, Cookie Crisp was introduced in Europe and Asia. The mascot in these countries is Chip the Wolf (originally known as The Howler), a wolf who fruitlessly attempts to steal Cookie Crisp from children much like how the Trix Rabbit would when it comes to Trix, and describes the cereal: \"It looks like chocolate chip cookies. Tastes like 'em too. But it's a breakfast cereal!\". He is voiced by Marc Silk.\n\nIn 2005, Chip the Wolf replaced Chip the Dog as the cereal's mascot in the United States. However, Cookie Crook and Cookie Cop have made reappearances on the back of the later Cookie Crisp boxes.\n\n"}

Her soaring, wide-ranging voice — from contralto croon to soul-wrenching wail — made her a pillar of gospel music. The \"Chicago Tribune\" stated that \"Andrews' throaty contralto made her low notes thunder, while the enormous range of her instrument enabled her to reach stratospheric pitches without falsetto\" and that \"her dramatic delivery made her a charismatic presence in church and on stage.\"\n\nAndrews started singing in the church as a child and performed gospel music on the road in various gospel groups from the 1940s before joining The Caravans in 1957. Fellow member from The Caravans in the 1950s, Shirley Caesar, once dubbed Andrews \"The High Priestess\" for her ability to hit high notes, and, in 2013, stated, \"there never was and never will be another voice like Inez Andrews.\" Another early member of the Caravans, Albertina Walker often said, \"nothing ever worked for the Caravans until Inez started whistling\" — hitting the high notes. She sang lead on The Caravans first breakthrough hit, \"Mary Don't You Weep\", and also had hits as a solo artist with crossover recordings such as \"Lord Don't Move The Mountain\". (#48 in 1973 on \"Billboard\" R&B chart on Song Bird label). She was referred to in 2012 by the New York Times as \"the last great female vocalist of gospel's golden age,\" ranking among the likes of other music legends from the \"Golden Era\" of Black Gospel (1945–60) - Mahalia Jackson, Marion Williams, Dorothy Love Coates, Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Clara Ward.\n\nInez McConico was born in Birmingham, Alabama, United States to Theodore and Pauline McConico. Her mother died when she was two years old. Her father, a coal miner, was often out of work during the Great Depression. Andrews traveled a tough road to gospel stardom. She began singing as a child in church and began songwriting as a young mother in Birmingham. Andrews was working six days a week, ten hours a day for 18 dollars a week, while \"washing, ironing, cooking, keep up with the kids.\" With her busy life in her youth, she felt that life had to have more to offer her. As she pondered that prayerfully, she picked up \"a pencil and a brown paper bag\" and began to write. Thus began her songwriting career. Andrews began her singing career in the 1940s with two groups in Birmingham, Alabama: Carter's Choral Ensemble and the Original Gospel Harmonettes. By the mid-1950s, the Harmonettes were one of the nation's top gospel groups, with Andrews the understudy for the group's lead singer, Dorothy Love Coates. Coates recommended Andrews to the Caravans, and she eventually moved north to Chicago to become widely known as that group's first successful singer, leading them to the high of their popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nIn 1962, Andrews left the Caravans to start her own group, Inez Andrews and the Andrewettes. They toured the country performing songs such as \"It's in My Heart\" and her composition \"(Lord I Wonder) What Will Tomorrow Bring?\". But by 1967 she was touring as a soloist.\n\nIn the 1960s, Andrews solo work and songwriting further ensconced her in the gospel pantheon. Her songs were recorded by many artists, including The Mighty Clouds of Joy and Aretha Franklin. Andrews became one of the major stars of gospel's golden age, with The Caravans songs such as \"Lord Keep Me Day By Day\", \"Remember Me\", \"I Won't Be Back\" and several other hits in which Andrews was lead vocalist, including \"Mary Don't You Weep\", \"I'm Not Tired Yet\", \"Make It In\", \"He Won't Deny Me\" and \"I'm Willing\".\n\nIn 2006, she released a reunion album with The Caravans, Albertina Walker, Dorothy Norwood, and original soprano Delores Washington, entitled \"Paved the Way\".\n\nAfter a stellar career with the Caravans, she left the group in 1962 and had huge success with her 1972 crossover hit, \"Lord Don't Move the Mountain\". Andrews recorded on many labels since the 1950s and has many albums and hit songs to her credit, some of which she composed herself. Andrews enjoyed further solo success throughout the 1970s and 1980s with songs such as \"Just For Me\", \"A Sinner's Prayer\" and a live 1981 recording of James Cleveland’s hit song \"I Appreciate\". Andrews claimed to have wrote the gospel standard \"No Tears In Heaven\" early in her singing career. The writing credits for the song was disputed between her and Sallie Martin whom Andrews claimed wrote down the lyrics to the song while she was singing it at a program. Andrews recorded her version of the song in 1983.\n\nAndrews was a dedicated Christian and family person. She raised seven children during her career in gospel music. She died on December 19, 2012, at the age of 83. She had been diagnosed with cancer months earlier. Andrews is survived by seven children, 19 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nIn 2002 Andrews was inducted into the Gospel Hall of Fame. It was announced prior to her death that Andrews would be honoured with the Ambassador Dr. Bobby Jones Legend Award at the 2013 Stellar Awards. The award ended up being presented posthumously.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It lies approximately east of Słubice, south-west of Gorzów Wielkopolski, and north-west of Zielona Góra. \n\nIn 2008 the village had a population of 700.\n\nKunersdorf was first documented in 1337 as part of the Neumark region (\"Terra trans Oderam\") in eastern Brandenburg. Elector Jobst of Luxembourg sold it to the City of Frankfurt in 1399. It was devastated by the troops of Duke Jan II the Mad of Żagań on his 1477 expedition against the Brandenburg elector Albert Achilles of Hohenzollern and again by Imperial as well as Swedish forces during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nDuring the Seven Years' War, the village was occupied by Russian forces after the Prussian defeat at the 1759 Battle of Kay. On 12 August 1759 at the Battle of Kunersdorf, the Prussian Army of King Frederick II was destroyed by the united Russian and Austrian forces under Count Pyotr Saltykov.\n\nIn 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars Kunerdorf belonged to the newly created Prussian Province of Brandenburg. With Prussia it became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany, and from 1873 on was administered within the Weststernberg district with its capital at Drossen. The village was conquered by the Red Army during the Vistula–Oder Offensive in February 1945. Since the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line by the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, Kunowice has been part of Poland.\nAfter 1945, Kunowice station was the site of a railroad border crossing on the line from Poznań to Frankfurt, until in 2003 a new station was opened at the border town of Słubice.\n\nKunowice's railway station appeared in the 2004 German film \"Distant Lights\" (\"Lichter\").\n"}
{"id": "2197063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197063", "title": "Peabody Trust", "text": "Peabody Trust\n\nThe Peabody Trust was founded in 1862 as the Peabody Donation Fund and now brands itself simply as Peabody. It is one of London's oldest and largest housing associations with around 55,000 properties across London and the South East. It is also a community benefit society and urban regeneration agency, a developer with a focus on regeneration, and a provider of an extensive range of community programmes.\n\nThe Trust was founded in 1862 by London-based American banker George Peabody, who in the 1850s had developed a great affection for London, and determined to make a charitable gift to benefit it. His initial ideas included a system of drinking fountains (comparable to the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association scheme actually set up by Samuel Gurney and Edward Thomas Wakefield in 1859), or a contribution to the \"ragged schools\" of the Earl of Shaftesbury. In March 1859, however, he settled on establishing a model dwellings company. Three years later, in a letter to \"The Times\" on 26 March 1862, he launched the Peabody Donation Fund, with an initial gift of £150,000. The aim of the organisation, he said, would be to \"ameliorate the condition of the poor and needy of this great metropolis, and to promote their comfort and happiness\". The paper reported, \"We have today to announce an act of beneficence unexampled in its largeness and in the time and manner of the gift\". Shortly before his death in 1869, Peabody increased his gift to £500,000.\n\nThe Peabody Trust was later constituted by Act of Parliament, stipulating its objectives to work solely within London for the relief of poverty. This was to be expressed through the provision of model dwellings for the capital's poor.\nThe first block, designed by H. A. Darbishire in a red-brick Jacobethan style, opened in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, on 29 February 1864. It cost £22,000 to build, and contained 57 \"dwellings\" (i.e. flats) for the poor, nine shops with accommodation for the shopkeepers, and baths and laundry facilities on the upper floor. Water-closets were grouped in pairs by the staircases, with one shared between every two flats. This first block was followed by larger estates in Islington, Poplar, Shadwell, Chelsea, Westminster, Bermondsey, and elsewhere. By 1882 the Trust housed more than 14,600 people in 3,500 dwellings. By 1939 it owned more than 8,000 dwellings.\n\nIn its early days, the Trust imposed strict rules to ensure that its tenants were of good moral character. Rents were to be paid weekly and punctually; there was a night-time curfew and a set of moral standards to be adhered to; and the dwellings could not be used for certain trades.\n\nPeabody states that in pursuit of its mission it will: \"put the most vulnerable first\"; \"design, build and maintain homes and neighbourhoods which people are proud to live in\"; \"help people, households and communities to be more resilient\"; and \"[g]row and use our position of influence to create positive change\".\n\nPeabody is leading a £1 billion regeneration of Thamesmead, Abbey Wood and Plumstead in South-East London. The Group worked with the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Bexley to successfully bid for Greater London Authority housing zone status, which led to a c£80 million investment.\n\nAs well as providing thousands of new homes in the area, Peabody says it will provide firm foundations for Thamesmead’s long term, sustainable rejuvenation by investing in existing homes, infrastructure and services to improve the quality of life for existing residents. Going beyond \"bricks and mortar\", Peabody says its work with partners will enhance employment, enterprise, cultural, social and leisure opportunities for people which is supported by socio-economic outputs locally.\n\nThamesmead and the surrounding area is a major growth and opportunity area for London. Crossrail will open at nearby Abbey Wood from 2019, and Peabody has said it will capitalise on this, ensuring the right amenities, infrastructure and transport connections are available for the long term sustainability of the area.\n\nIn 2014 Gallions, Trust Thamesmead and Tilfen Land became part of the Peabody Group. The Peabody Group now comprises two housing associations, Peabody and Gallions, and a number of trading companies..\n\nIn July 2017 Peabody merged with Family Mosaic housing association under the \"Peabody\" name.\n\nHousing associations borrow money to pay for new homes and improvements. In March 2011, Peabody raised £200 million on a corporate bond, at a rate among the best secured by a housing association borrowing in its own name.

One of her films was \"Granny\", which earned her a special jury prize at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2003.\n\nLidyia Bobrova was born in 1952 in the far east area of Amur. She studied History in university before moving on to the study of screen writing and directing.\n\nAfter graduating from VKSR (Higher Courses for Scriptwriters and Directors) Bobrova started making films in 1991. Her directorial debut \"Oi, vy, gusi (Hey, You Geese,\" 1991), depicted the life of three brothers struggling a world that has forgotten them. Her next film was \"V toi strane\" (\"In That Land...\", 1997) which followed life in a Russian village in the 1890's.\n\nThe film was critically acclaimed but was not accepted into the Moscow Film Festival due to \"unprofessionalism.\" While it was successful abroad it never achieved the same success in Russia.\n\nHer next film \"Babusia\" was her most successful winning the audience prize in the Paris film festival in 2003. Following a granny in Russia who takes care of her children, grand-children and neighbours children.\n\nEight years later Bobrova released her final film, \"Veruiui (I Believe, dir. Lydia Bobrova 2006)\" based on three short stories by Vasilii Shukshin adapted for a more modern period.\n\nBobrova was heavily influenced by village life in Russia often centring her movies around Russian villages and the slow pace of rural life. Her films juxtaposed wide shots of Russian landscapes with confined interiors of farm houses. Depicting a world where the central characters of her films struggled to survive against harsh natural elements.\n\nDedicating her career to representing life in Russian farm lands. Bobrova created a filmography based around \"glubinka\", Russian rural peasant life which she grew up in.\n\nShe has been described as a member of the Russian new wave, with her films being released in the years immediately after the fall of communism.\n\nHer films deal with preoccupations of nature and societal fabric. Scholars have argued that these traditional examinations of society are an examination of the current life in Russia. She represents these movies with long takes, realist mis-en-scene and static camera work.\n\nBobrova, took realism to a high degree even using non-professional actors even in critical roles, such as the titular grandmother in \"Babusyia.\" \n\nBobrova foregrounds gender in her filmography. Her award winning film \"Babousia\" examines the life of a grandmother as her family changes in the soviet era. The struggling matriarch in \"Babuysia\" for one, in other films Bobrova has reversed traditional gender norms, depicting women doing tasks of physical labour or men doing domestic work.\n\nFamily relationships and brotherly connection are at the centre of her first film \"Oi, vy, gusi.\" Examining their male relationship. Her films correlate male cultivation of land toward Russian communist values or oppose them.\n\nBobrova expands on this parable throughout her filmography, with the question of women as primary caretakers at the forefront of her work. She also uses age as a cinematic technique of representation in her work. By drawing on the difference between the ages of siblings in \"Oi, vy, gusi\" or the grandmother, this aging becomes symbolic of relationships with the past and spirituality.\n"}
{"id": "2197070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197070", "title": "IP (complexity)", "text": "IP (complexity)\n\nIn computational complexity theory, the class IP (which stands for Interactive Polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable by an interactive proof system. It is equal to the class PSPACE. The result was established in a series of papers: the first by Lund, Karloff, Fortnow, and Nisan showed that co-NP had multiple prover interactive proofs; and the second, by Shamir, employed their technique to establish that IP=PSPACE. The result is a famous example where the proof does not relativize.\n\nThe concept of an interactive proof system was first introduced by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff in 1985. An interactive proof system consists of two machines, a prover, \"P\", which presents a proof that a given string \"n\" is a member of some language, and a verifier, \"V\", that checks that the presented proof is correct. The prover is assumed to be infinite in computation and storage, while the verifier is a probabilistic polynomial-time machine with access to a random bit string whose length is polynomial on the size of \"n\". These two machines exchange a polynomial number, \"p\"(\"n\"), of messages and once the interaction is completed, the verifier must decide whether or not \"n\" is in the language, with only a 1/3 chance of error. (So any language in BPP is in IP, since then the verifier could simply ignore the prover and make the decision on its own.)\n\nA language \"L\" belongs to IP if there exist \"V\", \"P\" such that for all \"Q\", \"w\":\n\nThe Arthur–Merlin protocol, introduced by László Babai, is similar in nature, except that the number of rounds of interaction is bounded by a constant rather than a polynomial.\n\nGoldwasser et al. have shown that \"public-coin\" protocols, where the random numbers used by the verifier are provided to the prover along with the challenges, are no less powerful than private-coin protocols. At most two additional rounds of interaction are required to replicate the effect of a private-coin protocol. The opposite inclusion is straightforward, because the verifier can always send to the prover the results of their private coin tosses, which proves that the two types of protocols are equivalent.\n\nIn the following section we prove that IP = PSPACE, an important theorem in computational complexity, which demonstrates that an interactive proof system can be used to decide whether a string is a member of a language in polynomial time, even though the traditional PSPACE proof may be exponentially long.\n\nThe proof can be divided in two parts, we show that IP ⊆ PSPACE and PSPACE ⊆ IP.\n\nIn order to demonstrate that IP ⊆ PSPACE, we present a simulation of an interactive proof system by a polynomial space machine. Now, we can define:\n\nand for every 0 ≤ \"j\" ≤ \"p\" and every message history \"M\", we inductively define the function \"N\":\n\nwhere:\n\nwhere Pr is the probability taken over the random string \"r\" of length \"p\". This expression is the average of \"N\", weighted by the probability that the verifier sent message \"m\".\n\nTake \"M\" to be the empty message sequence, here we will show that \"N\" can be computed in polynomial space, and that \"N\" = Pr[\"V\" accepts \"w\"]. First, to compute \"N\", an algorithm can recursively calculate the values \"N\" for every \"j\" and \"M\". Since the depth of the recursion is \"p\", only polynomial space is necessary. The second requirement is that we need \"N\" = Pr[\"V\" accepts \"w\"], the value needed to determine whether \"w\" is in A. We use induction to prove this as follows.\n\nWe must show that for every 0 ≤ \"j\" ≤ \"p\" and every \"M\", \"N\" = Pr[\"V\" accepts \"w\" starting at \"M\"], and we will do this using induction on \"j\". The base case is to prove for \"j\" = \"p\". Then we will use induction to go from \"p\" down to 0.\n\nThe base case of \"j\" = \"p\" is fairly simple. Since \"m\" is either accept or reject, if \"m\" is accept, \"N\" is defined to be 1 and Pr[\"V\" accepts \"w\" starting at \"M\"] = 1 since the message stream indicates acceptance, thus the claim is true. If \"m\" is reject, the argument is very similar.\n\nFor the inductive hypothesis, we assume that for some \"j\"+1 ≤ \"p\" and any message sequence \"M\", \"N\" = Pr[\"V\" accepts \"w\" starting at \"M\"] and then prove the hypothesis for \"j\" and any message sequence \"M\".\n\nIf \"j\" is even, \"m\" is a message from \"V\" to \"P\". By the definition of \"N\",\n\nThen, by the inductive hypothesis, we can say this is equal to\n\nFinally, by definition, we can see that this is equal to Pr[\"V\" accepts \"w\" starting at \"M\"].\n\nIf \"j\" is odd, \"m\" is a message from \"P\" to \"V\". By definition,\n\nThen, by the inductive hypothesis, this equals\n\nThis is equal to Pr[\"V\" accepts \"w\" starting at \"M\"] since:\n\nbecause the prover on the right-hand side could send the message \"m\" to maximize the expression on the left-hand side. And:\n\nSince the same Prover cannot do any better than send that same message. Thus, this holds whether \"i\" is even or odd and the proof that IP ⊆ PSPACE is complete.\n\nHere we have constructed a polynomial space machine that uses the best prover \"P\" for a particular string \"w\" in language \"A\". We use this best prover in place of a prover with random input bits because we are able to try every set of random input bits in polynomial space. Since we have simulated an interactive proof system with a polynomial space machine, we have shown that IP ⊆ PSPACE, as desired.\n\nIn order to illustrate the technique that will be used to prove PSPACE ⊆ IP, we will first prove a weaker theorem, which was proven by Lund, et al.: #SAT ∈ IP. Then using the concepts from this proof we will extend it to show that TQBF ∈ IP. Since TQBF ∈ PSPACE-complete, and TQBF ∈ IP then PSPACE ⊆ IP.\n\nWe begin by showing that #SAT is in IP, where:\n\nNote that this is different from the normal definition of #SAT, in that it is a decision problem, rather than a function.\n\nFirst we use arithmetization to map the boolean formula with \"n\" variables, φ(\"b\", ..., \"b\") to a polynomial \"p\"(\"x\", ..., \"x\"), where \"p\" mimics φ in that \"p\" is 1 if φ is true and 0 otherwise provided that the variables of \"p\" are assigned Boolean values. The Boolean operations ∨, ∧ and ¬ used in φ are simulated in \"p\" by replacing the operators in φ as shown in the table below.\n\nAs an example, φ = \"a\" ∧ \"b\" ∨ ¬\"c\" would be converted into a polynomial as follows:\n\nThe operations \"ab\" and \"a\" ∗ \"b\" each result in a polynomial with a degree bounded by the sum of the degrees of the polynomials for \"a\" and \"b\" and hence, the degree of any variable is at most the length of φ.\n\nNow let \"F\" be a finite field with order \"q\" > 2; also demand that q be at least 1000. For each 0 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"n\", define a function \"f\" on \"F\", having parameters formula_14, and a single variable \"a\" in \"F\": For 0 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"n\" and for formula_15 let \nNote that the value of \"f\" is the number of satisfying assignments of φ. \"f\" is a void function, with no variables.\n\nNow the protocol for #SAT works as follows:\n\n\nNote that this is a public-coin algorithm.\n\nIf φ has \"k\" satisfying assignments, clearly \"V\" will accept. If φ does not have \"k\" satisfying assignments we assume there is a prover formula_21 that tries to convince \"V\" that φ does have \"k\" satisfying assignments. We show that this can only be done with low probability.\n\nTo prevent \"V\" from rejecting in phase 0, formula_21 has to send an incorrect value formula_23 to \"P\". Then, in phase 1, formula_21 must send an incorrect polynomial formula_25 with the property that formula_26. When \"V\" chooses a random \"r\" to send to \"P\", \nThis is because a polynomial in a single variable of degree at most \"d\" can have no more than \"d\" roots (unless it always evaluates to 0). So, any two polynomials in a single variable of degree at most \"d\" can be equal only in \"d\" places. Since |\"F\"| > 2 the chances of \"r\" being one of these values is at most formula_28 if \"n\" > 10, or at most (\"n\"/1000) ≤ (\"n\"/\"n\") if \"n\" ≤ 10.\n\nGeneralizing this idea for the other phases we have for each 1 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"n\" if \nthen for \"r\" chosen randomly from \"F\", \nThere are \"n\" phases, so the probability that formula_21 is lucky because \"V\" selects at some stage a convenient \"r\" is at most 1/\"n\". So, no prover can make the verifier accept with probability greater than 1/\"n\". We can also see from the definition that the verifier \"V\" operates in probabilistic polynomial time. Thus, #SAT ∈ IP.\n\nIn order to show that PSPACE is a subset of IP, we need to choose a PSPACE-complete problem and show that it is in IP. Once we show this, then it clear that PSPACE ⊆ IP. The proof technique demonstrated here is credited to Adi Shamir.\n\nWe know that TQBF is in PSPACE-Complete. So let ψ be a quantified boolean expression:\n\nwhere φ is a CNF formula. Then \"Q\" is a quantifier, either ∃ or ∀. Now \"f\" is the same as in the previous proof, but now it also includes quantifiers.\n\nHere, φ(\"a\", ..., \"a\") is φ with \"a\" to \"a\" substituted for \"x\" to \"x\". Thus \"f\" is the truth value of ψ. In order to arithmetize ψ we must use the following rules:\n\nwhere as before we define \"x\" ∗ \"y\" = 1 − (1 − \"x\")(1 − \"y\").\n\nBy using the method described in #SAT, we must face a problem that for any \"f\" the degree of the resulting polynomial may double with each quantifier. In order to prevent this, we must introduce a new reduction operator \"R\" which will reduce the degrees of the polynomial without changing their behavior on Boolean inputs.\n\nSo now before we arithmetize formula_35 we introduce a new expression:\n\nor put another way:\n\nNow for every \"i\" ≤ \"k\" we define the function \"f\". We also define formula_38 to be the polynomial \"p\"(\"x\", ..., \"x\") which is obtained by arithmetizing φ. Now in order to keep the degree of the polynomial low, we define \"f\" in terms of \"f\":\n\nNow we can see that the reduction operation R, doesn't change the degree of the polynomial. Also it is important to see that the R\"\" operation doesn't change the value of the function on boolean inputs. So \"f\" is still the truth value of ψ, but the R\"\" value produces a result that is linear in \"x\". Also after any formula_42 we add formula_43 in ψ′ in order to reduce the degree down to 1 after arithmetizing formula_44.\n\nNow let's describe the protocol. If \"n\" is the length of ψ, all arithmetic operations in the protocol are over a field of size at least \"n\" where \"n\" is the length of ψ.\n\n\n\n\"V\" uses coefficients to evaluate formula_48 and formula_49. Then it checks that the polynomial degree is at most \"n\" and that the following identities are true:\nIf either fails then reject.\n\n\"V\" → \"P\": \"V\" picks a random \"r\" in \"F\" and sends it to P. (If formula_52 then this \"r\" replaces the previous \"r\").\n\nGoto phase \"i\" + 1 where \"P\" must persuade \"V\" that formula_53 is correct.\n\n\nThis is the end of the protocol description.\n\nIf ψ is true then \"V\" will accept when \"P\" follows the protocol. Likewise if formula_56 is a malicious prover which lies, and if ψ is false, then formula_56 will need to lie at phase 0 and send some value for \"f\". If at phase \"i\", \"V\" has an incorrect value for formula_58 then formula_59 and formula_60 will likely also be incorrect, and so forth. The probability for formula_56 to get lucky on some random \"r\" is at most the degree of the polynomial divided by the field size: formula_62. The protocol runs through \"O\"(\"n\") phases, so the probability that formula_56 gets lucky at some phase is ≤ 1/\"n\". If formula_64 is never lucky, then \"V\" will reject at phase \"k\"+1.\n\nSince we have now shown that both IP ⊆ PSPACE and PSPACE ⊆ IP, we can conclude that IP = PSPACE as desired. Moreover, we have shown that any IP algorithm may be taken to be public-coin, since the reduction from PSPACE to IP has this property.\n\nThere are a number of variants of IP which slightly modify the definition of the interactive proof system. We summarize some of the better-known ones here.\n\nA subset of IP is the deterministic Interactive Proof class, which is similar to IP but has a deterministic verifier (i.e. with no randomness).\nThis class is equal to NP.\n\nAn \"equivalent\" definition of IP replaces the condition that the interaction succeeds with high probability on strings in the language with the requirement that it \"always\" succeeds:\n\nThis seemingly stronger criterion of \"perfect completeness\" does not change the complexity class IP, since any language with an interactive proof system may be given an interactive proof system with perfect completeness.\n\nIn 1988, Goldwasser et al. created an even more powerful interactive proof system based on IP called MIP in which there are \"two\" independent provers. The two provers cannot communicate once the verifier has begun sending messages to them. Just as it's easier to tell if a criminal is lying if he and his partner are interrogated in separate rooms, it's considerably easier to detect a malicious prover trying to trick the verifier if there is another prover it can double-check with. In fact, this is so helpful that Babai, Fortnow, and Lund were able to show that MIP = NEXPTIME, the class of all problems solvable by a nondeterministic machine in \"exponential time\", a very large class. Moreover, all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs in an MIP system, without any additional assumptions; this is only known for IP assuming the existence of one-way functions.\n\nIPP (\"unbounded IP\") is a variant of IP where we replace the BPP verifier by a PP verifier. More precisely, we modify the completeness and soundness conditions as follows:\n\n\nAlthough IPP also equals PSPACE, IPP protocols behaves quite differently from IP with respect to oracles: IPP=PSPACE with respect to all oracles, while IP ≠ PSPACE with respect to almost all oracles.\n\nQIP is a version of IP replacing the BPP verifier by a BQP verifier, where BQP is the class of problems solvable by quantum computers in polynomial time. The messages are composed of qubits. In 2009, Jain, Ji, Upadhyay, and Watrous proved that QIP also equals PSPACE, implying that this change gives no additional power to the protocol. This subsumes a previous result of Kitaev and Watrous that QIP is contained in EXPTIME because QIP = QIP[3], so that more than three rounds are never necessary.\n\nWhereas IPP and QIP give more power to the verifier, a compIP system (\"competitive IP proof system\") weakens the completeness condition in a way that weakens the prover:\n\n\nEssentially, this makes the prover a BPP machine with access to an oracle for the language, but only in the completeness case, not the soundness case. The concept is that if a language is in compIP, then interactively proving it is in some sense as easy as deciding it. With the oracle, the prover can easily solve the problem, but its limited power makes it much more difficult to convince the verifier of anything. In fact, compIP isn't even known or believed to contain NP.\n\nOn the other hand, such a system can solve some problems believed to be hard. Somewhat paradoxically, though such a system is not believed to be able to solve all of NP, it can easily solve all NP-complete problems due to self-reducibility. This stems from the fact that if the language L is not NP-hard, the prover is substantially limited in power (as it can no longer decide all NP problems with its oracle).\n\nAdditionally, the graph nonisomorphism problem (which is a classical problem in IP) is also in compIP, since the only hard operation the prover has to do is isomorphism testing, which it can use the oracle to solve. Quadratic non-residuosity and graph isomorphism are also in compIP. Note, Quadratic non-residuosity (QNR) is likely an easier problem than graph isomorphism as QNR is in UP intersect co-UP.\n\n"}

It broadcasts to the San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area from a its transmitter on Cerro Bola. XHLNC-FM airs a Spanish adult hits format.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2018, XHLNC was a classical music station known as XLNC1, broadcasting from studios in Chula Vista, California. Between 2018 and 2019, it was operated by Mexican broadcaster Grupo Larsa Comunicaciones.\n\nThe station was founded by Víctor Díaz, who owned Califórmula Broadcasting, a company that controlled numerous stations in Tijuana. Upon his death in 2004, Diaz stipulated that XHLNC-FM continue with its classical format, from funding Díaz had set aside, as well as contributions from listeners. The station permit was transferred to Martha Margarita Barba de la Torre, one of Díaz's descendants.\n\nXLNC1 began in 1998 as an internet radio project showcasing classical music. In January 2000, it transitioned into a physical radio station on 90.7 MHz upon receiving its permit.\n\nXHLNC, which for its first six months was known as XHTNA-FM, was originally permitted to sign-on with a Class A 1,000-watt signal, broadcasting from a tower located in the Mount San Antonio area of Tijuana that had been used by other Califórmula stations. 90.7 is also the frequency for KPFK in Los Angeles, which operates at a grandfathered 110,000 watts. (Southern California is in the Class B zone, where FM stations would normally have a maximum power of 50,000 watts.) Due to KPFK's enlarged coverage area, XLNC1's signal suffered co-channel interference in many sections of San Diego County. However, due to a treaty between the US and Mexico concerning radio stations near the border, XLNC1 could not increase its coverage much north of the border. Despite this, Díaz solicited a power increase for XHLNC to 10 kW, which the SCT approved on July 14, 2003.\n\nOn June 29, 2007, Cofetel, the Mexican Federal Telecommunications Commission, cleared XHLNC-FM to switch frequencies to 104.9 MHz and move its transmitter to Cerro Bola in Tecate (also used by XHHIT-FM and XHPRS-FM). The move was announced by XLNC1 the next month. The switch would bring less interference to the station, resolve interference to KPFK, allow the station to boost its power from 1,000 watts to 7,500 watts, and move its tower to \"the highest point in Baja\", above sea level.\n\nThe frequency change took place on February 10, 2008. At first, the 90.7 frequency aired a pre-recorded message by Gordon Brown stating that XLNC1 had moved to 104.9 FM. Unfortunately, the new transmitter had problems, causing some listeners to experience reception problems on XLNC1's new frequency. About two weeks after the frequency change, XLNC1's e-mail newsletter reported that there was a faulty component in the transmitter that would take some time to replace. On February 26, XLNC1 decided to simulcast programming on both 90.7 and 104.9 frequencies. By fall of that year, XLNC1 had its 90.7 frequency taken back by the Mexican government, and the station was broadcasting only on 104.9 FM.\n\nIn 2010, XHTIM-FM was authorized to move from 97.7 to 90.7 and increase its power by using the frequency on which XHLNC once broadcast.\n\nIn July 2010, XLNC1 decided to remove the label \"Classical Music\" from its advertising and replace it with more generic terms such as \"Great Music\", \"Beautiful Music\", and \"Music for All Generations.\" The decision was also made to remove lengthy repertoire and opera from general programming in favor of lighter classical and crossover works. This was explained as a method to reach out to younger listeners. The station continues to broadcast lengthier works in the evenings with programs entitled \"Gala Concerts\".\n\nAs a classical station serving a binational audience, XLNC1 typically introduced pieces in Spanish and gave the information in English at the end. Announcers included Kingsley McLaren, Sue Harland, Gabriela Guinea-Johnston (chief Spanish announcer) and Gordon Brown. Most of the programming was automated, with the announcers prerecording their identifications of titles, artists and composers.\n\nOn February 9, 2018, XLNC1 announced through their official Facebook account that they would no longer be broadcasting on FM and would only continue online, effective March 1, due to a lack of continued donations.\n\nThe announcement read:\n\n\"Dear listeners, it is with a heavy heart that we inform you that as of March 1st, XLNC1 will no longer be broadcasting on the air (104.9FM). We will, however, maintain our streaming service online via our website at www.xlnc1.org, and you will still be able to listen to us through our App on iPhone and Android devices. We are truly grateful for all the years we have been able to reach our wonderful audience in San Diego and Baja California, and we sincerely thank you for all of your generous support through the years.\"\n\nThe station ended FM transmissions on March 2, and on March 3, the new format was announced: the 104.9 frequency was taken over by Grupo Larsa Comunicaciones, the largest broadcaster in Sonora which had assumed control of stations in Mexicali in 2017, and began to carry its flagship Toño Spanish Adult Hits format in a non-commercial version, owing to XHLNC's status as a social station.\n\nOn December 17, 2019, MLC Media, a Spanish-language radio syndication company based in Los Angeles, announced it would assume control of XHLNC and run it as Spanish rhythmic \"Más Flo\" beginning the next day, with programming originating from its LA studios.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, MLC Media pulled the plug on the “Mas Flo” Spanish rhythmic format and changed their format to Spanish adult hits, citing the noncommercial nature of the XHLNC concession.\n\n"}
{"id": "2197089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197089", "title": "Lithostratigraphy", "text": "Lithostratigraphy\n\nLithostratigraphy is a sub-discipline of stratigraphy, the geological science associated with the study of strata or rock layers. Major focuses include geochronology, comparative geology, and petrology. In general a stratum will be primarily igneous or sedimentary relating to how the rock was formed.\n\nSedimentary layers are laid down by deposition of sediment associated with weathering processes, decaying organic matters (biogenic) or through chemical precipitation. These layers are distinguishable as having many fossils and are important for the study of biostratigraphy. Igneous layers are either plutonic or volcanic in character depending upon the cooling rate of the rock. These layers are generally devoid of fossils and represent intrusions and volcanic activity that occurred over the geologic history of the area.\n\nThere are a number of principles that are used to explain the appearance of stratum. When an igneous rock cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, then we can say that the igneous intrusion is younger than the sedimentary rock. The principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed stratum is younger than the one beneath and older than the one above it. The principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially horizontal beds.\n\nA lithostratigraphic unit conforms to the law of superposition, which state that in any succession of strata, not disturbed or overturned since deposition, younger rocks lies above older rocks. The principle of lateral continuity states that a set of bed extends and can be traceable over a large area.\n\nLithostratigraphic units are recognized and defined on the basis of observable rock characteristics. The descriptions of strata based on physical appearance define facies. Lithostratigraphic units are only defined by lithic characteristics, and not by age.\n\n\"Stratotype\": A designated type of unit consisting of accessible rocks that contain clear-cut characteristics which are representative of a particular lithostratigraphic unit.\n\n\"Lithosome\": Masses of rock of essentially uniform character and having interchanging relationships with adjacent masses of different lithology. e.g.: shale lithosome, limestone lithosome.\n\nThe fundamental Lithostratigraphic unit is the formation. A formation is a lithologically distinctive stratigraphic unit that is large enough to be mappable and traceable. Formations may be subdivided into members and beds and aggregated with other formations into groups and supergroups. \n\nTwo types of contact: \"conformable\" and \"unconformable\".\n\n\"Conformable\": unbroken deposition, no break or hiatus (break or interruption in the continuity of the geological record). The surface strata resulting is called a \"conformity\".\n\nTwo types of contact between conformable strata: \"abrupt contacts\" (directly separate beds of distinctly different lithology, minor depositional break, called \"diastems\") and \"gradational contact\" (gradual change in deposition, mixing zone).\n\n\"Unconformable\": period of erosion/non-deposition. The surface stratum resulting is called an unconformity.\n\nFour types of unconformity:\n\n\nTo correlate lithostratigraphic units, geologists define facies, and look for key beds or key sequences that can be used as a datum.\nGeological correlation is the main tool for reconstructing the geometry of layering in sedimentary basins. The lithological correlation is a procedure, decisive what layers (strata) in geological cross-sections located in different places belong to the same geological body now (or belonged in the past). The identification is based on comparison of physical and mineralogical characteristics of the rocks, and on general assumptions known as the Steno's principles: \n1. The sedimentary strata occurred sequentially in time: the youngest at the top.<br>\n2. The strata are originally horizontal.<br>\n3. The stratum extends in all directions until it thins out or encounters a barrier.\n\nThe results are presented as a correlation scheme (A). Practical correlation has a lot of difficulties: fuzzy borders of the layers, variations in composition and structure of the rocks in the layer, unconformities in the sequence of layers , etc. This is why errors in correlation schemes are not seldom. When the distances between available cross-sections are decreasing (for example, by drilling new wells) the quality of correlation is improving, but meanwhile the wrong geological decisions could be made that increases the expenses of geological projects.<br>\n\nThe law of superposition is inapplicable to intrusive, highly deformed, or metamorphic bodies of rock lacking discernible stratification. Such bodies of rock are described as \"lithodemic\" and are determined and delimited based on rock characteristics. The 1983 North American Stratigraphic Code adopted the formal terms \"lithodeme\", which is comparable to a formation; a \"suite\", which is analogous to a group, and a \"supersuite\", similar to a supergroup. A lithodeme is the fundamental unit and should possess distinctive and consistent lithological features, comprising a single rock type or a mixture of two or more types that distinguishes the unit from those around it. As with formations, a lithodemic unit is given a geographical name combined with either a rock name or some term describing its form. The term \"suite\" is deprecated. Also formalized is the term \"complex\", which applies to a body of rock of two or more genetic classes (sedimentary, metamorphic, or igneous). This establishes two hierarchies of lithodemic units:\n\nSimilar rules have been adopted in Sweden. However, the 1994 International Stratigraphic Guide regards plutons and non-layered metamorphic rocks of undetermined origin as special cases within lithostratigraphy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2197093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197093", "title": "Eric John Stark", "text": "Eric John Stark\n\nEric John Stark is a character created by the science fiction author Leigh Brackett. Stark is the hero of a series of pulp adventures set in a time when the Solar System has been colonized. His origin-story shares some characteristics with feral characters such as Mowgli and Tarzan; his adventures take place in the shared space opera planets of 1940s and 1950s science fiction.\n\nStark was born on Mercury. His parents were employees of the mineral extraction company Mercury Metals and Mining. After his parents died in a cave-in caused by a quake, Stark was adopted by a tribe of Mercurian aborigines who are described as hairy and possessing snouts. They gave him the name N'Chaka, meaning \"the man without a tribe\". He believed himself to be one of them, rather than a human, and endured their rigorous way of life in the Mercurian Twilight Belt, surviving by hunting rock-lizards.\n\nBefore Stark was fully grown, another group of human miners exterminated his tribe, captured Stark and imprisoned him in a cage. They would ultimately have killed him if he had not been rescued by the police official Simon Ashton, who raised Stark to adulthood.\n\nThe stories of the adult Stark are fast-paced adventures, but Brackett manages to insert more pathos than most authors. Because of his background, Stark is keenly aware of the injustices visited on the planetary \"primitives\" by the colonialist Earth, and tends to side with them against official bodies. At the opening of the story in which he first appears, Stark is evading a twenty-year sentence placed on him for running guns to a Venusian native group that has been resisting Terran colonizers.\n\nA point about Stark's physical appearance which has been studiously ignored by every one of his illustrators until the James Ryman's covers from the Paizo Publishing \"Planet Stories\" line: years of exposure to heightened sunlight on the planet Mercury has permanently given Stark very dark, almost black skin. His skin is \"almost as dark as his black hair\" and an antagonist refers to him scornfully as a \"great black ape\". The darkness of Stark's skin is reiterated in \"Enchantress of Venus\". Brackett's other Mercurian characters also have black skin (e.g. Jaffa Storm in \"The Nemesis from Terra\").\n\nBrackett's professional illustrators have universally drawn Stark as light-skinned, even sometimes blond. Brackett's use of a strong, independent, and attractive black-skinned character as hero for several of her stories was very unusual for the 1940s and 1950s. The artists' choice to ignore Brackett's written description and substitute a generic light-skinned blond pulp hero, even as late as 1982, may reflect prejudice against dark-skinned people. The effect of these misleading illustrations has been such that Stark is never remembered or referred to by critics as a black-skinned character, though he is clearly described as such in the stories.\n\nWhile Stark is described many times as having very dark skin, he appears to be of Caucasian rather than African descent; Brackett repeatedly tells her readers that Stark's unusual coloring is due to prolonged exposure to extreme sunlight while growing up on the planet Mercury. Brackett openly created Stark as a pastiche of Edgar Rice Burroughs' popular John Carter of Mars and Tarzan characters, and Stark's sun-blackened skin is the Mercurian version of Tarzan's sun-bronzed skin.\n\nStark first appeared in a group of novellas published in the pulp magazine \"Planet Stories\". These were: \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" (Summer 1949); \"Enchantress of Venus\" (Fall 1949), once published as \"City of the Lost Ones\"; and \"Black Amazon of Mars\" (March 1951). The first and last stories were expanded into short novels: \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" as \"The Secret of Sinharat\" and \"Black Amazon of Mars\" as \"People of the Talisman\". The expanded versions were first published in 1964 as an Ace Double paperback, and again in 1982 under the title \"Eric John Stark: Outlaw of Mars\". The internal chronology of the stories is different from the publishing order; in \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" Stark is on Mars, having fled capture on Venus; \"Black Amazon of Mars\" takes place soon after, but in an unexplored and barbaric area close to the north pole of Mars; and in \"Enchantress of Venus\", Stark has returned from Mars to Venus to look for a missing friend.\n\nThe two expanded novels have inconsistencies with their novella originals. \"The Secret of Sinharat\" is almost identical with \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" up to the point at which Stark arrives at Sinharat, but a crucial plot point is revealed earlier in the novella, and further developments diverge from (while occasionally overlapping) the storyline of \"Catacombs\". \"Black Amazon of Mars\" is largely different from \"People of the Talisman\", though founded on a similar premise.\n\nMany years later, Brackett returned to the character in a trilogy of books titled \"The Ginger Star\" (1974), \"The Hounds of Skaith\" (1974) and \"The Reavers of Skaith\" (1976). These stories are science fantasies set on a distant but primitive extrasolar planet, since Stark's original Solar System venue had become unacceptable to publishers. As a result, although the character's personality and origins are retained, there are few other links between the Skaith novels and the earlier Stark novellas.\n\nA final story, \"Stark and the Star Kings\" (2005), places Stark into the world of her husband Edmond Hamilton's \"Star Kings\" series, making it a rare collaboration between the two.\n"}

The work eventually led to the four-song \"You Are My Canvas\" demo, an EP influenced by fellow Burlington hardcore act Grade. Following the release of this demo, the band signed to One Day Savior Records and subsequently released the \"Broken Bones & Bloody Kisses\" EP.\n\nInterest in the band was immediate, and a short while later they signed to New Jersey-based Ferret Records. Their debut full-length album, 2003's \"Make Yourself Sick\", was a shock to some fans. It was much lighter and pop-punk-oriented, but with the same heavy screaming and guitars found on earlier releases. The band toured heavily in support of the record with acts such as My Chemical Romance, Catch 22, Saves the Day, and a stint on the Warped Tour circuit. Boys Night Out also was featured in the Nintendo Fusion Tour with Fall Out Boy, Motion City Soundtrack, The Starting Line, and Panic! at the Disco.\n\nThe band's next effort, 2005's \"Trainwreck\", is a somewhat more subdued, experimental concept album based on a man's loss of sanity. \"Trainwreck\" opens with a doctor dictating his notes into a tape recorder. The album chronicles the arrest, trial, treatment and subsequent release of a man who, in a waking dream, murders his wife and then cuts both his hands off with a machine at his work so that he can not kill again. Kara Dupuy's vocals act as the deceased wife's voice heard by the patient throughout the album.\n\nThe band released their third album, \"Boys Night Out\", on June 26, 2007. The first single from the album was \"Up with Me\".\n\nBoys Night Out played their first show in two years at the Opera House in Toronto using the original five members, on 24 October 2009. The band played both \"Broken Bones And Bloody Kisses\" and \"Make Yourself Sick\" in their entirety.\n\nConnor posted the following regarding the band's status on the Boys Night Out Facebook group:\n\n\"No breakup. No lost members. No getting dropped.\nWe're just taking it easy for a while. Once we finished our contract with Ferret we opted to leave the label. We've been touring non-stop for the past few years and we're all feeling the wear and tear of constant life on the road. We started this band as a means of escape from everyday life...this is a return to that frame of mind. Easy like Sunday morning. It's pretty refreshing to just sit back and write songs without pressure from all sides telling you that there HAS to be a new record on day x. Before we release another full-length we're going to take our time to make sure that it's as wickedly radical and gnarly as it can possibly be. So, yeah...that's the gist of it. You won't be seeing us playing a whole lot of shows in the coming months - and we definitely won't be playing extended tours - but we're still alive and kickin'.\"\n\nIn 2009, Lovat-Fraser and Davis joined producer Scott Komer to form a band called Hard Calibers. The main purpose of the band was to record a version of \"ESRT Page 14\" by Justin Veatch of the Ivoryton Piano Factory. The song is featured on a compilation album of music by Veatch, who died in 2008 at the age of 17.\n\nRecently Connor has been working with local acts such as the punk band 'The Eff Holes', and Electro-Pop group 'Crazy Diamond' featuring Regan and Matt Davis.\n\nThe band's song \"I Got Punched in the Nose for Sticking My Face in Other Peoples Business\" was used on the last episode of an anime titled .\n\nAs of early 2013 the band has still yet to make an official announcement on its split, but lead singer Lovat-fraser had this to say about the band's future, \"I'm sorry to say it, but I can't really see BNO getting back together for any shows. It seems that everyone is getting back together for reunion shows these days, but sadly, I don't think BNO will be counted among them.\"\n\nIn March 2013, Boys Night Out's Twitter account posted the following in regards to a new album: \"Just finished recording the new full-length. Sounds like shit.\". Two days later the band followed up by revealing their previous statement wasn't a reality, but finally provided fans with some closure on the band's end. They tweeted the following: \"There is no new album, but if we recorded one right now it would absolutely sound like shit.\". The former band's Twitter page description also states they are no longer a band though they still used the account from time to time.\n\nOn January 12, 2015, the band's Twitter account changed its heading to \"2015. Stuff is a-brewin'.\" Connor's Twitter also confirms that the band is working on new material.\n\nOn October 10, 2015, the band's Official Instagram posted an image of Bassist Dave Costa and Drummer Ben Arseneau in the studio with the caption \"Day one with @derekbrightest at @fox_sounds - new album on the way!\"\n\nOn January 21, 2016, the band released a press release announcing the release of a new album, \"Black Dogs\", in spring of 2016.\n\nIn early 2006, Kara Dupuy left Boys Night Out. As seen on the live show footage of \"Dude, You Need to Stop Dancing\", she had recently become engaged and chose to pursue a new life off the road.\n\nIn March, 2006, Andy Lewis, left his former band, The Fullblast, to join Boys Night Out on guitar.\n\nIn late 2006, Brian Southall left the band to join The Receiving End of Sirens. He was replaced with Ben Arseneau, the original drummer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He played as a shortstop in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres, and New York Mets from 1976 to 1991.\n\nBorn in Lockney, Texas, Templeton was hailed by many as one of the best players in baseball early in his career, which featured All-Star Game selections in and . In the latter year, Templeton made history as the first switch-hitter to collect 100 hits from each side of the plate, a feat achieved only once more by Willie Wilson in 1980. His total of 211 hits led the National League, and with 19 triples, he led the league for a third consecutive season. He led the Cardinals in hits in 1977, 1978, and 1979. He caused some controversy in 1979 when, despite having better numbers than either Dave Concepción or Larry Bowa, two of the National League's premier shortstops at the time, he wasn't selected to start at shortstop for the National League All-Star team. He was named to the team as a reserve, but refused to go. \n\nThe quote, \"If I ain't startin', I ain't departin'\" regarding the 1979 MLB All-Star Game is often mistakenly attributed to Templeton over his refusal to play. In reality, Jack Buck, Cardinals sportscaster at the time made the statement.\n\nHe continued to hit well in and ; however, he was not popular with Cardinals fans. The situation with the home fans came to a head when, during an August 26, 1981, home game in St. Louis, Templeton made an obscene gesture twice to some fans who had allegedly been heckling him after he had failed to run to first on a ground ball; manager Whitey Herzog physically pulled Templeton off the field following the incident. After the end of the season the Cardinals traded him to the Padres for Ozzie Smith. The trade was welcomed by everyone involved: Smith was (then) a light-hitting defensive wizard going to a team which needed to improve its defense (and he was also embroiled in a contract dispute with Padres' management), while Templeton was a better hitter going to a team which needed to improve its offense (and who was, due to his actions, no longer popular with the fans or the team).\n\nIn his ten years with the Padres, he played in 1,286 games, while having 1,135 hits, 43 home runs, 427 RBIs, and a .252 batting average, with one Silver Slugger Award win and one All-Star Game appearance in 1985. He was named team captain of the Padres by manager Larry Bowa in 1987, serving as captain for four years. 1991 was his final season in the majors. He played in 32 games for the Padres before being traded to the New York Mets on May 31 for Tim Teufel; he played in 80 more games for the Mets for a total of 112 that year. He hit for .221 with three home runs and 26 RBIs in the season.\n\nTempleton was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015.\n\nAfter his retirement as an active player in 1991, Templeton remained in the game as a coach and minor league manager. From 1998 through 2001, he managed in the Anaheim Angels organization for four teams, posting a 294-272 record. From 2003 to 2004, he managed the Gary Railcats of the Northern League, moving on to manage the Golden Baseball League's Fullerton Flyers in 2005. After three years with the Flyers, he would move on to manage the Arizona Winter League's Palm Springs Chill in 2008, then would return to the GBL to manage the Long Beach Armada in 2009. He managed the Chico Outlaws to the GBL Championship in 2010. On January 8, 2013, Templeton was named manager of the Newark Bears of the independent Can-Am League.\n\nHis son, Garry Templeton II, played minor league baseball from 1999–2007. He managed the Hawaii Stars in 2012 and the Vallejo Admirals from 2014-15, winning the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs Manager of the Year Award in 2014.

It usually is characterised with a cluster of high-rise buildings, with its own market or shopping mall. Mei Foo Sun Chuen, built by Mobil, is the earliest (1965) and largest by number of blocks (99).\n\nEarly real estate development in Hong Kong followed the urban street pattern: single blocks are packed along streets and most of them are managed independently, with quality varying from block to block. Private housing estates on the other hand provide integrated management throughout whole estate, attracting more affluent residents.\n\nMei Foo Sun Chuen, Taikoo Shing, Whampoa Garden and City One Shatin are early notable examples. More projects followed and the idea became widely accepted as the middle class of Hong Kong emerged.\n\nWith the economies of scale of large developments, and the lifting of height restrictions since the opening of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok, there is the tendency of new private tower block developments with 10 to over 100 towers, ranging from 30-to-70-storeys high.\n\nThere has also been a trend in joint ventures between the already oligopolistic real-estate developer in Hong Kong. Developers have been increasingly partnering up to bid for development sites. At a land auction on 8 May 2007, the Government warned developers not to collude in bidding.\n\nThere is currently some controversy over the \"wall effect\" caused by uniform high-rise developments which adversely impact air circulation and aggravate the heat effect but also impact public hygiene and contribute to air pollution. Private developers seeking to maximise revenues have tended to build uniform blocks on seafront sites to give all units unrestricted sea view.\n\nEnvironmental group Green Sense expressed concern that their survey on 155 housing estates found 104 have a 'wall-like' design. It cited estates in Tai Kok Tsui and Tseung Kwan O as the \"best examples\".\n\nHead of the Planning Department, Ava Ng, argued that the air ventilation factor has been taken into consideration with regard to the auction of all prime sites on the land application list, and said the erection of tall buildings at these sites will not create any \"wall effect.\"\n\nAn air ventilation assessment is required only for sites with a total gross floor area of more than 100,000 square metres, according to technical guidelines in existence since 2006.\n\nIn May, 2007, citing concern over developments in West Kowloon, and near Tai Wai and Yuen Long railway stations, Wong Kwok-hing of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions proposed a motion calling for measures to reduce screen-like buildings which maximise good views at the expense of air flow in densely populated areas. The motion was vetoed by functional constituency representatives.\n\nThe following is a partial list of private housing estates in Hong Kong:\n\n"}

It is bounded by Baxter Street, Pearl Street, the Brooklyn Bridge and the East River on the east, Upper New York Bay on the south, the Hudson River on the west and Canal Street on the north.\n\nManhattan Community Board 1's current Chairperson is Anthony Notaro, Jr. and its staff includes: District Manager Lucian Reynolds, Director of Land Use and Planning Diana Switaj, Planning Consultant Michael Levine, Community Liaison Tamar Hovsepian and Community Coordinator Lucy Acevedo.\n\nThe Manhattan Community Board 1 office is located at 1 Centre Street, Room 2202 North, New York, NY 10007.\n\nAs of the United States Census, 2010, the Community District has a population of 60,978, up from 34,420 in 2000, 25,366 in 1990, and 15,918 in 1980. Of them (as of 2010), 40,810 (66.9%) are white non-Hispanic, 2,595 (4.3%) are African American, 10,627 (17.4%) Asian or Pacific Islander, 55 (0.1%) American Indian or Native Alskan, 264 (.4%) of some other non-Hispanic race, 1,780 (2.9%) of two or more non-Hispanic races, 4,847 (7.9%) of Hispanic origins. 5.6% of the population benefit from public assistance as of 2011, down from 9.6% in 2005.\n\nAfter 9/11, many buildings converted from commercial to residential uses, drawing many new residents. Formerly a hub of financial and commercial activity, Community District 1 is quickly transforming into a mixed-use 24/7 area. A component of this transformation is a rapidly growing child population.\n\nIn 2013, Community Board 1 planning staff conducted a demographic analysis to document the district's increasing youth population. Using block-level data from the 2000 and 2010 Census, the analysis showed that each Community District 1 neighborhood had experienced an extreme increase in its youth populations; particularly in the 0-4 and 5-9 age groups. For instance, the average growth of the 0-4 population in the entire borough of Manhattan increased .7% between 2000 and 2010, but increased 149% in Battery Park City, 196% in Tribeca, 57% in the Seaport/Civic Center, and 242% in the Financial District. Similarly, between 2000 and 2010, the 5-9 age group decreased 16.4% in the entire borough of Manhattan, but increased 75% in Battery Park City, 69% in Tribeca, 44% in the Seaport/Civic Center, and 158% in the Financial District.\n\nOn April 15, 2015, Manhattan Community District 1 conducted a follow-up study on the population increase and demographic changes in the area. The study utilized a compilation of built and expected new residential units in the area and multiplied by the average household size (1.94). The residential units count was tabulated from 2012 to 2015 and beyond using various news media sources in addition to data from the Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center and the New York City Department of Transportation Construction Project list. Final residential unit counts may vary as they are continuously being updated. The results of the study showed that an estimated total of 8,466 additional residential units have been constructed or are planned for construction since 2012. Furthermore, based on the residential units tabulation, total population in Manhattan Community District 1 has steadily increased at an average rate of approximately 5% annually.\n\nDemographic changes in Manhattan Community District 1 including the rapidly growing residential population and subsequent increase in children ages 0–18 have major implications for the area. In many cases, the development of community infrastructure has not matched the changing demographics. For instance, Community District 1 has severe school overcrowding issues. Trends in birth rates and residential development indicate that the residential and youth populations of Community District 1 are likely to continue to increase.\n\nThe land area is 955.6 acres, or .\n\n"}

Niño, Guagua, Pampanga, Santos was the fourth of seven children of Gaudencio Santos, an overseer of farmland near Mount Arayat, and Rosalia Jiao. Rufino's three elder brothers were Manuel, Emiliano, and Quirino; his three sisters were Clara, Jovita, and Exequiela. Santos, nicknamed \"Pinong\", grew up in a house located 30 meters from what is now the Immaculate Conception Parish. He was active in church activities as an acolyte, and was later a choir member of the Manila Cathedral School. Two factors influenced his priestly vocation: his stint as an altar server, and the encouragement of Father Jose Tahon, Manila Cathedral's parish priest.\n\nHe entered San Carlos Seminary on July 25, 1921, and earned a Baccalaureate in Canon Law in 1929 and a Doctorate in Sacred Theology in July 1931 at Pontificia Universita Gregoriana. In 1927, the 19-year-old Santos and Leopoldo A. Arcaira, 24—both outstanding students of San Carlos Seminary—were the first recipients of the scholarships at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy.\n\nPinong was granted a Papal dispensation to be ordained below the canonical age of 24. On Oct. 25, 1931, two months shy of his 23rd birthday, Rufino J. Santos was ordained priest at the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome. He then served as assistant parish priest in Imus, Cavite and as a parish priest in Marilao, Bulacan.\n\nHis later successor as Archbishop, Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, said during the Second World War,\n\nIn 1953, Santos was appointed Archbishop of Manila on February 10 and was installed on March 25 on the same year. Pope John XXIII made him a cardinal on 28 March 1960. He was the first native Filipino to become a cardinal. Santos paved the way for the founding of Catholic Charities (eventually known as Caritas Manila) and the reconstruction of St. Paul Hospital (now the Cardinal Santos Medical Center), which was established by the Maryknoll Sisters, and damaged by American bombardment during the Second World War. Santos also re-instituted the Philippine Trust Company and the Catholic Travel Office.\n\nDuring his years in Manila, he rebuilt the Manila Cathedral, which had been destroyed by Allied bombardment during the 1945 Liberation of Manila. It was dedicated on December 10, 1958. He hosted the visit of Pope Paul VI to the Philippines to attend the Asian Bishops’ Meeting. Santos served as the Archbishop of Manila from 1953 to 1973.\n\nSantos established the Church-run Radio Veritas and built important structures including the Our Lady of Guadalupe Minor Seminary along EDSA in Makati City; the Pius XII Catholic Center in Paco, Manila; and Villa San Miguel, the Archbishop's palace in Mandaluyong.\n\nCardinal Rosales said that Santos was a diabetic and that he suffered from a malignant brain tumor.\n\nHe died in Manila on 3 September 1973, 8 days after his 65th birthday. Following his death, a diplomatic report from the United States Embassy in Manila assessed his activities:\nSantos' opposition to \"Social Action\" programs, which he frequently expressed in heavy-handed fashion, did much to perpetuate the Church's image as a conservative organization, allied with the country's economic and social elite.\n\nCaritas Manila’s history began with a Cardinal that \"walked the talk\".\n\nCardinal Santos, the first Filipino Cardinal, became the 29th Archbishop of Manila in a post-war scenario that saw a nation plagued with the following: a high dependency on the upper class in the country's social, economic and political growth; a growing inequality in the distribution of wealth; a critical unfairness in labor, land and tenancy—all catalysts to the resurgence of the communist movement. It was to this disparate social order that Cardinal Santos spoke upon his installation:\n\nThis plan took shape soon after when the Cardinal appointed an eleven-man Administrative Board on October 1, 1953. And so a new era had dawned when the establishment of Caritas Manila (first known as Catholic Charities) brought structure and organization to the way the Church’s charitable works in the Archdiocese of Manila were being implemented.\n\nThe initial years were largely a period of identifying those who needed help the most, prioritizing and allocating medical aid, food and clothing when needed. These were superseded by programs that harnessed talents and opened up work opportunities for Manila's teeming masses, such as the educational assistance program and job placement program. Nonetheless, it was medical assistance, crisis intervention and emergency relief that had the greatest impact, reaching thousands of the sick and indigent. Cardinal Santos was \"reviled\" for his \"conservatism on social issues and business acumen\" . However, it was his vision and altruism that had made Caritas Manila a success and his most noteworthy accomplishment.\n\nThe CBCP announced that Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales would lead the August 26, 2008 centennial rites for Santos at his hometown of Sto. Nino, Guagua, Immaculate Conception Parish Church. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was to lead the event by unveiling a historical marker and a 6-foot statue of Santos (sculpted by Edillardo Paras) and donated by Cesar L. Villanueva's wife, Arlyn Sicangco-Villanueva, president of Holy Angel University in Angeles City. The rites also included the exhibit of Cardinal Santos memorabilia, loaned by the Archdiocese of Manila and the Kapampangan Museum at Clark. The bronze statue will sit atop a 7-foot concrete pedestal outside the Rufino J. Cardinal Santos Convention Hall adjacent to the parish church. Villanueva also presented to the President, a copy of the book “Padre Pinong, the First Filipino Cardinal” authored by Francis Musni.\n\nOn September 3, 2018, his 45th death anniversary, to commemorate the legacy of Cardinal Santos, and for the preparation for the 60th anniversary of the renovation of the post-war Manila Cathedral, a Mass and the ceremonial tradition of raising of the galero was officiated by the present Archbishop of Manila, Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle.\n\n\n"}

What sets the ACCA apart from most such Churches is that it espouses the theology and embraces many distinctive practices of the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Indian Orthodox Church, from which the clergy of the ACCA claim to derive apostolic succession primarily via the lineage of René Vilatte. The orders of the ACCA are also derived from the Old Catholic movement, in this case by way of Arnold Mathew. The ACCA, however, is not in communion with any of the Oriental Orthodox Churches. It ordains women to the diaconate and does not require celibacy of its bishops, allowing them, like priests and deacons, to marry. The ACCA states that its approach to theology and practice is a process of \"critical reappropriation\" which is open to influences from all sectors of trinitarian Christianity but is, at the same time, rooted in the Syriac Christian tradition, particularly with regard to such foundational matters as Christology (miaphysitism), soteriology, ecclesiology, and Christian ethics.\n\nThe see city of the ACCA is Knoxville, Tennessee. It is led by a metran, or archbishop, Victor Mar Michael Herron. Herron, consecrated bishop in 1991, assumed the office of metran in 1996 upon the retirement of his predecessor and consecrator, Gordon Mar Peter Hurlburt. Herron is assisted by a suffragan bishop, Andreas Mar Cassian Turner.\n\nTurner is the chancellor of the ACCA. Avva Gregory Ned Blevins is the ACCA's Ecumenical and Social Concerns Representative. Amma Caitlin Turner, formerly an itinerant missionary throughout the southeastern United States, is now retired.\n\n"}
