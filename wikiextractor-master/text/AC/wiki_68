Phillips and published by Hewson Consultants in the late 1980s for various home computer systems. International releases and ports were known by various other names, including Castelian, , Subline and Tower Toppler.\n\nThe game's original 8-bit release received some critical acclaim, in particular the Commodore 64 release, which garnered a Gold Medal award from UK magazine \"Zzap!64\".\n\n\"Nebulus\" was followed by a lesser-known sequel, \"Nebulus 2\", on the Amiga in the 1990s. An Atari ST version was also in development but was cancelled.\n\n\"Nebulus\" is a platform game with some distinctive unique features. The player character, a small green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight towers that have been built in the sea, by planting bombs at the towers' peaks. Pogo's progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles, which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower.\n\nThe actual gameplay happens at each tower in turn. Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top. The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators. Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no \"left\" or \"right\" edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.\nA graphical innovation, and perhaps the most notable feature of the game, is that when Pogo walks left or right, he always stays in the centre of the visible screen. Instead of the Pogo sprite moving, the tower behind him turns clockwise or counterclockwise with a convincing sense of depth. This was noted favourably in reviews of the game.\n\nAlong his way to the top of the tower, Pogo encounters many different enemies, mostly shaped like basic geometric shapes. Pogo can shoot some of the enemies, while some are impervious to shooting. Contact with an enemy knocks Pogo down to the ledge below. If there is no ledge below, Pogo falls into the sea and drowns.\n\nOnce he has reached the top of the tower, Pogo needs to enter a door to trigger the tower's destruction mechanism. After that, the tower crumbles to the sea. Pogo then boards his submarine and enters a bonus stage (in some versions, but not for example in the ZX Spectrum version), where he can shoot various kinds of fish to score bonus points.\n\nThe game was originally released by Hewson for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and Acorn Archimedes. The US version, which was published by U.S. Gold, was released under the title \"Tower Toppler\". A version for the Atari 7800 was also released with this title.\n\nThe Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System versions of \"Castelian\" were developed by Bits Studios and released in the United States by Triffix and in Japan by Hiro Entertainment; in these, the lead character is called Julius. The Game Boy and Nintendo versions were later released in Japan as \"Kyoro Chan Land\", which replaced Julius with Kyorochan, jewels with Chocoballs, altered the enemy graphics and (in the Famicom version) added a password system and a pause feature. The Italian bootleg version was called \"Subline\". The Nintendo versions were composed by David Whittaker, and the title songs were covered by Whittaker from the original Tower Toppler game's title screen. In the Famicom version, the title screen plays what is the bonus game theme from the US version.\n\nIn 2004 it was re-released on the C64 Direct-to-TV. On June 20, 2008, the C64 DTV version made its comeback on the Wii's Virtual Console download service in Europe on June 13, 2008 and later in North America on May 4, 2009.\n\nThe Atari 8-bit version was being developed around 1988 by the author of the Atari 7800 port, and was intended to be released by Atari Corporation for the XE Game System. However, although the game appeared in Atari promotional material of the time, it never reached the market. The game's prototype cartridge was later found.\n\n\"Compute!\" stated that the Commodore 64 version of \"Tower Toppler\" had \"good arcade action, with well-executed graphics\". Orson Scott Card wrote in the magazine that \"the graphics are terrific ... As science fiction, it's fun but shallow. As an action game, it's just plain fun\". \"Computer Gaming World\" gave the game a positive review, saying, \"Between delightfully benign game play ..., clever obstacles (though none are very difficult to figure out), and lively animation, you will have a great time with this game. Well, maybe you won't, but \"I\" will.\" It earned a Zzap! Gold Medal Award.\n\nThe game was voted Best Original Game Of The Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. The ZX Spectrum version was rated number 30 in the \"Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time\". The Amiga version was ranked the 14th best game of all time by \"Amiga Power\".\n\n"}

It is a specific type of apheresis, the more general term for separating out one particular constituent of blood and returning the remainder to the circulation.\n\nLeukapheresis may be performed to decrease a very high white blood cell count, to obtain blood cells from a patient (autologous) or donor (allogeneic) for later transplant into the patient, or to obtain cells for research purposes. \n\nIn the case of hematological malignancies such as chronic leukemias, white blood cell counts may be high enough to cause leukostasis and \"sludging\" in the capillaries (acute leukemias have a more variable white cell count whereas chronic cases typically have higher white cell counts). This can affect retinal vasculature leading to vision changes, pulmonary vasculature leading to shortness of breath from decreased efficiency in oxygen exchange, as well as other organ systems such as the brain which would become clinically apparent with neurological deterioration of a patient from cerebrovascular compromise.\n\nLeukapheresis may be performed to obtain the patient's own blood cells for later transplant. White blood cells may be removed to protect them from damage before high-dose chemotherapy, then transfused back into the patient, in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Another novel use of cells obtained through leukapheresis is to stimulate a patient’s immune system to target prostate cancer cells.\n\nAlternatively, only granulocytes, macrophages and monocytes may be removed, leaving the lymphocyte count largely unchanged. This is used as a treatment for autoimmune diseases such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis, where these cells play an active part in the inflammation process.\n\nLeukapheresis, typically for granulocytes, is a rarely performed blood donation process. The product is collected by automated apheresis and is used for systemic infections in patients with neutropenia. The donor is typically a blood relative who has received stimulating medications (a directed donation), and the product is irradiated to prevent GVHD. The product generally has a 24-hour shelf life from collection and is often transfused before infectious disease testing is completed. It is a therapy of last resort, and its use is controversial and rare.\n\nLeukapheresis is used in evolving CAR-T cell therapy to obtain leukocytes from a cancer patient or donor which can be modified and given to the patient as a therapeutic dose. \n\nThe word \"leukapheresis\" () uses combining forms of \"leuk-\" + \"apheresis\", although it quite plausibly could be parsed as \"leuko-\" + \"pheresis\", as both of those forms are accepted alternate forms (\"leuk-/leuko-; apheresis/pheresis\"). The latter parsing explains why people often spell the word with an \"-o-\" as \"*leukopheresis\"; nonetheless, no professionally curated dictionaries as of 2016 enter that spelling, and it is traditionally treated as a misspelling by medical style guides that mention it.\n\n"}

He helped turn post World War I Bavaria into Germany's center of radical-nationalism, but was then instrumental in the collapse and suppression of Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. In revenge for the latter, he was murdered later in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives.\n\nBorn in Weißenburg in Bayern, Kahr studied law and worked as a lawyer before entering politics. He served Bavaria's House of Wittelsbach faithfully, efforts that earned him the title \"Ritter\". Politically, he was a monarchist and had links to the Catholic Bavarian People's Party (BVP), though he was a Protestant and never joined any party.\n\nIn 1917, he became head of the \"Regierungsbezirk\" (provincial) government of Upper Bavaria, continuing in the post even after the establishment of the People's State of Bavaria in November 1918 ended the Wittelsbach monarchy, though for pragmatic reasons: he wanted to help defend middle- and upper-class interests from further disruption. In support of this goal, Kahr proposed the creation of a civil defence force, but his suggestion did not meet with the approval of Prime Minister Johannes Hoffmann. Not long after, in April 1919, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. Kahr fled Munich with Hoffmann and the rest of the state government to Bamberg, where they called for volunteers to help crush the Soviet. Those who responded were organised into \"Freikorps\".\n\nIt was after the suppression of the Bavarian Soviet Republic at the beginning of May, which saw hundreds of civilians murdered by \"Freikorps\" fighters, that Kahr delved into Bavarian paramilitary politics. Munich's leaders wanted to maintain the capabilities of the \"Freikorps\", but without their drawbacks. In brief, the \"Freikorps\" were too violent, too small, and too independent of the Bavarian state. The Civil Guards, or \"Einwohnerwehr\", was formed in an attempt to resolve these deficiencies.\n\nIn March 1920, Kahr succeeded Hoffmann as prime minister of Bavaria. He came into office under military influences as a secondary result of the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch of 13 March in Berlin. The most powerful party in Bavaria, the BVP, was then in a state of much anxiety as a result of the experiences of Bolshevism, chaos, and violence through which Munich had passed in the spring of 1919. The ministry presided over by the socialist Hoffmann had succeeded in quelling Bolshevism with the aid of Republican troops from Prussia and Württemberg, but the great majority of the BVP, as well as liberals of various shades, not to speak of the monarchists and reactionaries, wanted further guarantees against a recurrence of the Bolshevist terror.\n\nThe Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch in Berlin gave the signal for political action in Munich, and at a midnight sitting the Bavarian socialist ministry was somewhat unceremoniously hustled out of office — it is alleged under military pressure — and a coalition cabinet under Kahr installed. The coalition included reactionaries whose influence became more and more predominant. They were backed up by formerly liberal Bavarian journals which had been bought up by Prussian industrialists.\nKahr's administration was essential in turning Bavaria into a \"Ordnungszelle\" (cell of order), giving room for all kinds of right-wing groups. He also supported separatist forces that aimed at Bavarian secession from Germany, but after the German government passed a decree for the protection of the Republic against right-wing extremists, Kahr resigned on 21 September 1921.\n\nOn 26 September 1923, following a period of turmoil with assassinations and political violence, Prime Minister Eugen von Knilling declared martial law and appointed Kahr, who had returned to his provincial post, as \"Staatskomissar\" (state commissioner) with dictatorial powers. Together with Bavarian State Police head Colonel Hans Ritter von Seisser, and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, he formed a triumvirate.\n\nThat year, many reactionary groups wanted to emulate Mussolini's \"March on Rome\" with a \"March on Berlin.\" Among these were the wartime General Erich Ludendorff and the Nazi (NSDAP) group, led by Adolf Hitler. Hitler decided to use Ludendorff as a figurehead in an attempt to seize power in what was later known as the \"Hitler Putsch\" or Beer Hall Putsch. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Kahr and his triumvirate. However, Kahr had his own plan with Seisser (Seißer) and Lossow to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler. Kahr warned the \"patriotic associations\" against independent action. Despite his misgivings over Hitler's tactics, Kahr was every bit a right-wing patriot who stood against the Weimar government and believed action against those in Berlin was warranted. Akin to the later and infamous rhetoric of Hitler, Kahr remarked to an assembly of high-ranking officers on 19 October 1923 that the real matter at hand was \"a great battle of two worldviews which will decide the destiny of the German people – the international Marxist-Jewish and the national Germanic.\" Along this line, Kahr was not unlike many conservative Germans and his identification of perceived foreign threats is a defining feature of post-1918 German ideology; against which, it was widely believed, Germans had to make a stand. Accordingly, Kahr and his right-wing compatriots wanted to challenge the seeming cowardice of the extant government of Germany and eventually seize control since he found the Weimar Constitution and its leadership decidedly un-German in disposition.\n\nWeighing on Kahr's mind however, were injunctions from Berlin against reactionary activities. All the rage amid right-wing groups in Bavaria against the resumption of war-reparation payments did not temper the determination of the government in Berlin. The Weimar leadership's staunch warnings against revolutionary activities included military intervention if necessary. Troops under the command of General von Seeckt (who was previously identified among the right-wing circles as a possible choice for dictator) were poised and positioned for action. Stern warnings were reiterated by General von Seeckt, prompting the triumvirate of Kahr, Lossow, and Seisser to lose heart, at which point they informed the members of \"Kampfbund\", (which was headed by Hitler) that they would determine when precipitate action would be taken. This did not sit well with Hitler.\n\nHitler was determined to act before the appeal of his agitation waned. On 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people that had been organized by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler interrupted Kahr's speech and announced that the national revolution had begun, declaring the formation of a new government with Ludendorff. While waving his gun around, Hitler demanded the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow. Hitler's forces initially succeeded at occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters; however, neither the army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler. Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow were briefly detained but then released. The three quickly fled to join the opposition to Hitler. During the night, and unknown to Hitler, they prepared the resistance against the coup. The following day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government as a prelude to their \"March on Berlin\", but the police dispersed them. Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup. Kahr's involvement in the collapse of Hitler's putsch cost him the support of right-wing nationalist forces in Bavaria.\n\nKahr was forced to resign from his post as \"Staatskommissar\" on 16 February 1924, after Reichskanzler Wilhelm Marx had secretly met von Knilling on 18 January 1924 and convinced him to drop both von Kahr and von Lossow.\n\nAfter this, Kahr served as President of the Bavarian law court for reviewing administrative acts and then, having sunk into relative obscurity, retired from public service three years later.\n\nOn 30 June 1934, during what became known as the Night of the Long Knives, Kahr was brutally murdered by the Nazis for his \"treason\" during the Beer Hall Putsch. He was abducted from his Munich apartment and tortured by two SS members en route to the Dachau concentration camp. After his arrival there, Kahr was shot on orders of Theodor Eicke, the camp commandant. Historian Thomas Childers reports that Kahr was taken to a nearby swamp and hacked to death with axes. Whether he was shot first is unknown, but his mutilated body was found outside the camp a few days later. The murder was likely committed by .\n\n"}

On 1 January 2013 the former municipality of Erschmatt merged into the municipality of Leuk.\nSince it controls access to the Gemmi Pass, it had some importance from the time of Roman Raetia. The Leukerbad thermal baths are just North of Leuk, towards the pass. It is the capital of the Leuk district of the Valais.\n\nLeuk is home to one of the known installations of Onyx, the Swiss interception system for signals intelligence gathering.\n\nLeuk is first mentioned in 515 as \"villa de Leuca\".\n\nLeuk was already inhabited in the pre-Roman era. Scattered La Tène era graves with poppy-head pins, brooches and a belt hook have been found in Leuk. In the 6th century it belonged to the demesne of the King of Burgundy Sigismund, who donated it to the Abbey of Saint-Maurice. The local population of Romanized Celts gradually became Germanized around the turn of the millennium due to invading Alamanni. However, even by the 14th century there was still a strong Roman minority in Leuk.\nThe town's first church dates from the 6th or 7th century and probably originated from a Roman building. This church was replaced in the 9th century by a larger building. It was replaced again in the 11th and 12th centuries. The romanesque bell tower of the current church is from this third building. The current church was built by Ulrich Ruffiner in the gothic style. It was richly furnished with altars and sculptures and was consecrated in 1494 as St. Stephan's Church by Bishop Jost von Silenen. In the charnel house, with its dance of death fresco, 26 statues dating from the 13th to 16th centuries were discovered in 1982 under about a meter (three feet) of bones. The statues including an excellent Pietà from the 14th century. In addition to St. Stephan's parish church there were several other churches in town. They include a pilgrimage chapel at Thel and the Ringacker chapel, which was built in 1690-94 above a plague cemetery. A Marian shrine, whose hermitage was inhabited by a hermit around 1720–1885, is one of the most important baroque rooms of the Valais.\n\nIn the Early and High Middle Ages Leuk changed owners repeatedly until 1138 when it finally came under the authority of the Bishop of Sion. The new rulers encouraged Leuk's development by granting concessions. In 1209 Leuk was given the right to have its own weights and measures. In 1285 they built a hospital and in 1310 they added a warehouse, one on the old trade route between northern Italy and the markets of Champagne. With the warehouse they established a group of teamsters that provided extra draft animals to help wagons make it over the mountains. The episcopal fiefholders Viztum and Meier built the Bishop's Castle (the seat of Meier) and the Viztumsturm (Viztum's tower). In the 14th century the castle ruled over three surrounding areas; Loye (Lobio), Tschablen (Cabulo) and Galdinen (Caldana). All three of those areas grew into independent municipalities. In 1458, Leuk codified the customary rights of the citizens into law. This \"old castle law\" was updated in 1563.\n\nWith the decline of the feudal system, the weakening of the secular episcopal power and the rise of the democratic self-consciousness of the Valais, the old order was replaced with a new power structure. The former leading families of de Leuca, Perrini, von Raron and Pontemallio were replaced with new families who had made their money in military service including: the Werra, Mageran, Allet, Ambühl, Albertini, Gasner, Mayenzet, Zen-Ruffinen and Loretan. The village subsequently grew into an independent town with elegant homes and a new church. On the west, a tower and bridge were built in the Dala gorge. The Feschel gorge to the east was spanned with a bridge in 1563.\n\nThe two gorges and the river Rhone to the south provided excellent natural fortifications for the growing town. The borders of the town were the site of several bloody clashes. The first was the victory in 1296 of troops loyal to the bishop over the upper Valais nobility (including the vom Turn and von Raron families), who were supported by nobles from the Bernese Oberland. In 1386, Leuk prevented the advance of Count Amadeus VII of Savoy into the Upper Valais with the destruction of Dala bridge. In 1415, during the Rarner war, the Bishop's Castle and the Viztumsturm were destroyed by invaders. In 1541, Ulrich Ruffiner built the present Gothic-style town hall on the ruins of the Viztumsturm. During the fighting against the French in 1799, after the Battle of Pfyn Leuk was burned but escaped further damage.\n\nThe parish of Leuk is first documented in 1227. Starting in 1500 a number of surrounding villages left the Leuk parish to form their own daughter parishes, including; 1501 Leukerbad, 1660 Gampel, 1663 Turtmann, 1962 Susten. In the second half of the 16th century, the leading Leuker families tended to Protestantism. However, in 1604, when the Valais Grand Council met in Visp and voted to remain with the Catholic faith, these the families (especially the Mageran and Ambühl) decided to return to the old faith.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the local economy was based on the transport of goods, alpine herding, farming and viticulture. The town produced gravel from the banks of the Rhone in the Pfynwald (Pfyn forest), until this was restricted for environmental reasons in the 1970s. Limestone mining commenced in 1928 on the Rhone in Susten but has now been given up. In 2005 there were ten large farms and seven wineries in the municipality. In 1908 the Alusuisse-Werke (now Alcan Ltd) opened a processing plant in Chippis and Steg which provided jobs for many people from Leuk. The Leuk-Leukerbad-Bahn railway line opened in 1915 and converted to bus operation in 1967. In 2005, the train station in Susten was rebuilt with a new railway bridge over the Rhone and a new rail tunnel towards Salgesch. Traditionally Leuk was the central administrative center of the region. At the beginning of the 21st century, it is also the educational, legal and services center in part due to the satellite earth station of International Teleport Switzerland AG. The large antennas of the earth station have made Leuk into a major intercontinental telecommunications center. Near the earth station are the antennas of the Swiss military Onyx system for electronic intelligence gathering.\n\nIn 1999, the Leuk Castle Foundation was established to restore and maintain the Bishop's Castle in Leuk. As part of the restoration, one of the medieval towers was topped with a glass cupola by the architect Mario Botta.\n\nLeuk has an area, , of .

On her first introduction into society, in 1900, she met Crown Prince Ferdinand, the heir apparent to the Romanian throne, but after a secret engagement of one year, Marthe married at seventeen Prince George III Valentin Bibescu (\"Bibesco\"), scion of one of the country's prestigious aristocratic families. \"I stepped onto the European stage through the grand door\", she wrote on her wedding day. Her father, who had been educated in France, held the post of minister of the Kingdom of Romania in Paris and, later, that of minister of foreign affairs of Romania.\n\nFluent in French at an early age (even before she could speak Romanian), Marthe spent the first years of her marriage under the tutelage of her mother-in-law, Princess Valentine Bibesco (née countess Riquet de Caraman-Chimay), who saw to it that the extensive education in European history and literature Marthe already had was reinforced. An old peasant woman, Baba Uța [Outza], saw to it that she was also well-versed in Romanian folk traditions and tales. Meanwhile, her husband, George, was chasing fast cars and other women, but adding to the family fortune at the same time.\n\nDespite her wide circle of friends, and the birth of her daughter Valentine in 1903, Marthe was bored. In 1905, when George was sent by the Romanian king Carol I on a diplomatic mission to Mozzafar-al-Din, Shah of Iran, she eagerly embarked on the trip, recording her observations in a journal. Along the way, she stopped at Yalta, where she encountered the exiled Russian writer Maxim Gorki. It was in 1908, at the suggestion of Maurice Barrès, that Marthe completed and published her impressions of her Persian trip. The French critics and writers were enthusiastic and extremely complimentary. The travel memoirs, \"Les Huit Paradis\" (\"The Eight Paradises\"), launched her on a lifelong career as a successful writer of both nonfiction and novels. She became the toast of Belle Epoque Paris, moving easily among the literary, aristocratic and political power elites. She was awarded the Prix de l'Académie française and met Marcel Proust, who sent her a letter praising her book: \"You are not only a splendid writer, Princess, but a sculptor of words, a musician, a purveyor of scents, a poet.\"\n\nBack in Bucharest, in 1908, Marthe was introduced to the German Kronprinz, Wilhelm. Wilhelm (who, despite Marthe's references to him as \" the III\", was never to succeed Wilhelm II) was married, but he nevertheless wrote warmly affectionate letters to Marthe for the following fifteen years. She and her husband were invited to Germany, in the autumn of the same year, as Wilhelm's personal guests, visiting Berlin, Potsdam, Weimar, and taking part in the imperial regatta at Kiel. Marthe was awarded the supreme honour of accompanying Wilhelm in the imperial limousine, as it passed through the Brandenburg Gate, an entitlement otherwise reserved to members of the imperial family. He would also try to involve Marthe in the international relations of pre-war Europe, secretly asking her to be the quiet mediator between France and Germany on the Alsace-Lorraine issue.\n\nAmong the European nobility, divorce was social death, but dalliance was definitely not. While Marthe and George continued in what was sometimes actually a mutually supportive partnership, they pursued their own interests. The French prince Charles-Louis de Beauvau-Craon fell in love with Marthe, an affair that lasted for a decade. In Paris, she also encountered the Roman Catholic Abbé Mugnier, who converted her from her Eastern Orthodox faith, and she began an extensive, frank correspondence with him that was to last 36 years.\n\nExhausted by so many sentimental disappointments, Marthe withdrew to Algeria, then part of the French colonial Empire, to stay with an aunt of her husband, Jeanne Bibesco, thinking about divorcing George and espousing the prince de Beauvau-Craon. Still, she felt she could not do it; George would prove to be surprisingly generous and understanding, giving her the Mogoșoaia Palace (\"Mogosoëa\" in certain French renderings) in 1912.\n\nA couple of months before World War I, Marthe visited Spain, following the footsteps of Chateaubriand, her favorite French writer. In May, she was back in her country to greet Russian Emperor Nicholas II and his family, who were visiting the country after being invited by Princess Marie, wife of Prince Ferdinand.\n\nIn March 1915 Marthe met Christopher Thomson, the British military attaché, at a Palace soirée; he was arranging for Romania to join the Allies (although he did not agree with the policy, as Romania was unprepared for war). He remained devoted to her for the rest of his life. They corresponded regularly, and she dedicated four books to \"C.B.T.\" Later he was a Labour peer, and Secretary of State for Air. She visited the site of his death in the R101 airship accident on December 1930 with their mutual friend the Abbé Mugnier.\n\nWhen Romania at last entered the war on the Allied side in 1916, Marthe worked at a hospital in Bucharest until the German army burned down her home in Posada, in the Transylvanian Alps. She fled the country to join her mother and daughter in Geneva after a quarantine exile, imposed by the German occupiers, in Austria-Hungary (as a guest of the princely family of Thurn und Taxis at Latchen). There she continued to write. For most of her life, she wrote every morning until lunchtime—her journals alone fill 65 volumes.\n\nIn Switzerland, she began work on \"Isvor, pays des saules\" (\"Isvor, Land of Willows\"). It was Marthe's Romanian masterpiece, where she brilliantly conveyed the everyday life and customs of her people, the extraordinary mixture of superstition, deep philosophy, resignation and hope, and the unending struggle between age-old pagan beliefs and Christian faith.\n\nTragedy didn't spare Marthe, as her younger sister and her mother would commit suicide in 1918 and 1920 respectively.\n\nFor the Bibescos life after the war was more cosmopolitan than Romanian. Among her literary friends and acquaintances, Marthe counted Jean Cocteau, Paul Valéry, Rainer Maria Rilke, François Mauriac, Max Jacob, and Francis Jammes. In 1919, Marthe was invited to Prince Antoine Bibesco's wedding in London to Elizabeth Asquith, daughter of the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, H. H. Asquith, later Earl of Oxford and Asquith. Princess Elizabeth Bibesco, who died in Romania during World War II, is buried in the Bibesco family vault on the grounds of Mogoșoaia. Marthe for many years occupied an apartment in Prince Antoine's Quai Bourbon house at which she held literary and political salons.\n\nDuring this postwar period she rebuilt Posada, her mountain home, and began restoring the other family estate, Mogoșoaia, the palace built in Byzantine style. Again in London, she met Winston Churchill in 1920, starting a warm friendship that would last until his death in 1965. When her daughter Valentine married the Romanian prince Dimitrie Ghika-Comănești (24 November 1925) in a dazzling traditional ceremony, three Queens attended, (Queen-mother Sophia of Greece, Princess Consort Aspasia Manos of Greece and Queen Marie of Yugoslavia).\n\nMoving around Europe, acclaimed as each new book appeared--\"Le Perroquet Vert\" (1923), \"Catherine-Paris\" (1927), \"Au bal avec Marcel Proust\" (1928)--Marthe gravitated toward political power more than anything else. Without forgetting the former Kronprinz, Marthe had a short love affair with Alfonso XIII of Spain, and another with the French Socialist representative Henry de Jouvenel. In the latter case, the class differences shattered their relationship, something that Marthe used as the basis of her novel \"Égalité\" (\"Equality\", 1936). The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Ramsay MacDonald, found her fascinating. She visited him often in London and was his guest at Chequers. He wrote many touching, tender letters to her. Their close friendship ended only with his death.\n\nAccompanying George, who was by then chasing fast planes – in addition to his numerous women – Marthe flew everywhere: the United Kingdom (she counted among her friends the Duke of Devonshire Edward Cavendish, the Duke of Sutherland George, Vita Sackville-West, Philip Sassoon, Enid Bagnold, Violet Trefusis, Lady Leslie and Rothschild family members), Belgium, Italy (where she met Benito Mussolini in 1936), the Italian colony of Tripolitania (Libya), Istanbul, the United States (in 1934, as guests of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor), Ragusa, Belgrade and Athens.\n\nWhatever she wrote was a critical success and also sold well. But the money wasn't enough to cover the heavy expenses of her Mogoșoaia project (where the pavement of the Grand Hall is covered with gold), so she began writing popular romances under the pseudonym Lucile Décaux, and articles for fashion magazines under her own name. She had a long-term contract with \"The Saturday Evening Post\" and \"Paris-Soir\". In the 1920s and the 1930s, Mogoșoaia Palace was to become \"the second League of Nations\", as the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Louis Barthou, put it. There, annually, Marthe hosted royalty (among others, Gustav V of Sweden and the Queen of Greece), aristocracy (princes Faucigny-Lucinge, Princes de Ligne, the Churchills, the Cahen d'Anvers), politicians and ministers, diplomats and writers (Paul Morand, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry).\n\nAs the winds of war began again to sweep across Europe, the princess began to prepare. She visited Germany in 1938 to see Wilhelm, and was introduced to Hermann Göring; she visited the United Kingdom in 1939 to meet George Bernard Shaw. Her older grandson, John-Nicholas Ghika-Comănești, was sent to school in England in the same year (he was not to see his homeland again for 56 years). Romania entered the war in 1941, this time on the losing side.\n\nPrince George III Bibesco died on 2 June 1941; their relationship strengthened during his illness, even though he kept his mistresses. After visiting German-occupied Paris and Venice, she made a top-secret visit to Turkey in 1943 together with her cousin, Prince Barbu II Știrbey (\"Barbo Stirbey\"), trying to negotiate Romania's withdrawal from the Second World War. When the Red Army invaded her country, Marthe had a passport and connections enabling her to leave on 7 September 1945. Ironically it was not Marthe but her cousin Antoine Bibesco's wife Elizabeth who was the last Bibesco to be buried on the grounds of Mogoșoaia after her death on 7 April 1945. Neither Marthe nor Antoine would ever return to Romania. When the communist government took power in 1948, it confiscated all Bibesco property. She spent the remainder of her life in Paris and England.\n\nEventually, Valentine and her husband were released from Romanian detention in 1958, and allowed passage to Britain, where Marthe, now totally dependent on her writing for money, bought them a home, the Tullimaar residence at Perranarworthal in Cornwall. She remained in Paris, first living at the Ritz Hotel (1946–1948), then in her apartment at 45, Quai de Bourbon. In 1955, she was appointed a member of the Belgian Academy of French Language and Literature, on the seat previously held by Anna de Noailles (née Bibesco, princess Bassaraba de Brancovan). Marthe cherished the 1962 award of the Légion d'honneur. It was in 1960 that her novel (27 years-in-the-making), \"La Nymphe Europe\", which was really her autobiography, was published by Plon.\n\nNow a \"grande dame\", she enjoyed her last great friendship with a powerful leader, Charles de Gaulle, who invited her in 1963 to an Élysée Palace reception in the honour of the Swedish Sovereigns. De Gaulle also took a copy of \"Isvor, Pays des Saules\" with him when he visited Romania in 1968, and told her in the same year: \"... you do personify Europe to me.\" Marthe was 82 years old. She died on 28 November 1973 in Paris.\n\nIn January 2001, a national poll of the most influential women in Romania's history placed princess Marthe Bibesco in the first position as the woman of the Millennium and of the 20th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2142811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142811", "title": "LGBT rights in Finland", "text": "LGBT rights in Finland\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Finland are some of the most accepting in the world. According to an annual ILGA report, Finnish LGBT legislation is among the most extensive and developed legislations in Europe. Compared to fellow Nordic countries, it ranks near the top, outranked only by neighbouring Norway. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity have been legal in Finland since 1971 with \"promotion\" thereof decriminalized and the age of consent equalized in 1999, and homosexuality declassified as an illness in 1981. Discrimination based on sexual orientation in areas such as employment, the provision of goods and services, etc, was criminalized in 1995 and discrimination based on gender identity in 2005.\n\nSame-sex marriage and joint adoption by same-sex couples were approved by the Finnish Parliament in 2014, and the law took effect on 1 March 2017. Previously, Finland had allowed registered partnerships between 2002 and 2017, which gave same-sex couples the same rights as married couples except for adoption and a joint surname. In vitro fertilization (IVF) was legalized for lesbian couples in 2007 and stepchild adoption became possible for all same-sex couples in 2009.\n\nFinland is often referred to as one of the world's most LGBT-friendly countries and public acceptance of LGBT people and same-sex relationships is high.\n\nHomosexuality has been decriminalized since 1971, and was declassified as an illness in 1981, around the same time as in other European countries. The age of consent was equalized to 16 in 1999. Transvestism was declassified as an illness in 2011.\n\nRegistered partnerships (; ) in Finland were created for same-sex couples in 2002. The legislation, granting similar rights and responsibilities to same-sex couples as to married opposite-sex couples, was passed by the Parliament in September 2001 with a vote of 99–84. In May 2009, the Parliament revised the law allowing couples to adopt the biological children of their partner. Registered partnerships, which were available only to same-sex couples, were registered and dissolved using a procedure similar to that for civil marriages. The legislation also granted immigration rights to a same-sex foreign partner of a Finnish citizen. The registered partnership law was repealed on 1 March 2017 after same-sex marriage legislation came into effect.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the newspaper \"Kotimaa\", on March 11, 2010, the 2007 parliamentary election resulted in a split on the issue of same-sex marriage, with 54% of MPs opposing and 46% supporting a gender-neutral marriage law. However, four of the eight parties in the Parliament — the Social Democrats, the Greens, the Left Alliance, and the Swedish People's Party — had declared their support for same-sex marriage in their general position papers. The National Coalition put same-sex marriage on its agenda in its party congress in June 2010, though vice-chairman of its parliamentary group Ben Zyskowicz did not believe it would be approved at least by the NCP during the upcoming four years, basing his view on the fact that majority of the then NCP MPs were against it. The Centre Party had no general position on same-sex marriage, though it opposed adoption rights for same-sex couples. The Christian Democrats, and the True Finns took a negative stance on same-sex marriage in their electoral platforms.\n\nBased on support by five of the eight parties in the Parliament elected in 2007, it was considered possible that same-sex marriage would be legalized after the 2011 parliamentary elections. It was speculated that the issue of same-sex marriage would be a major theme, however, in an August 2010 survey by Yle, only 20% of the respondents said the issue should be a major theme. According to the voting advice application of \"Helsingin Sanomat\", 90 MPs of the 200-seat Parliament elected in 2011 supported same-sex couples' eligibility for external adoptions, while 93 MPs opposed it. As a result of the Christian Democratic inclusion in the cabinet – the Christian Democrats' chairperson, Päivi Räsänen, became the Minister of the Interior, – a bill legalizing same-sex marriage was not included in the government platform. However, according to the Left Alliance, it was agreed upon during the negotiations on government formation that, if proposed by an individual MP, such a bill would be endorsed by all the other parties in the Government Coalition (the National Coalition, the Social Democrats, the Left Alliance, the Green League and the Swedish People's Party).\n\nA work group for the bill, headed by National Coalition MP Lasse Männistö, was soon launched and began operating in September 2011. A bill was subsequently presented to the Finnish Parliament on 8 February 2012, with the collection of endorsement signatures - 76 of the 199 voting MPs indicated that they supported the bill. The bill received full support from the Left Alliance and ex-Left Alliance MPs (12 and 2, respectively) and the Greens (10), while it enjoyed majority support within the Social Democrats (30–12) and the Swedish People's Party (7–3). Meanwhile, the marriage bill enjoyed minority support within the National Coalition (14–30) and very little support from the Centre (1–34), while no MPs from either the True Finns nor the Christian Democrats voiced support. According to state broadcaster Yle, the bill had a reduced chance of passing because it was submitted as a private member's bill and, therefore, had to have at least 100 signatories in order to qualify for the preparation process in a parliamentary committee – as opposed to a government proposal which goes directly to a committee and to a vote in a parliamentary plenary session.\n\nOn 27 February 2013, the bill was voted down by the Legal Affairs Committee in a 9–8 vote. Prior to the rejection, proponents of the bill accused the committee chair, Anne Holmlund (who personally opposed the bill), of delaying the process. Holmlund denied this, pointing to a number of government proposals and bills with over 100 signatory MPs, which have precedence under the procedural rules. Finns Party MP Arja Juvonen, who had been expected to be more pro-gay than her predecessor on the committee (Johanna Jurva), also accused the Greens, the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance of pressuring her to endorse the bill against the Finns Party's group decision. An amendment to the Finnish Constitution passed on 1 March 2012 allows for citizens' initiatives with at least 50,000 valid signatories to be considered by the Parliament. As such, a civil campaign called \"Tahdon2013\" (\"I do 2013\") quickly gathered pace and collected the necessary signatures for the bill by 19 March 2013, gathering over 100,000 online signatures on the first day alone. In total, the initiative was backed by over 166,000 by its deadline, September 19, and was submitted to the Parliament in December 2013. The bill was put for introductory debate (\"lähetekeskustelu\") in plenary session on 20 February 2014, after which the bill was referred to the Legal Affairs Committee. On 25 June, the bill was rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee by a vote of 10-6. The Committee recommended that Parliament reject the bill. Two members were not present, though both apologized for being absent and stated that it would have failed on a 9-8 count if everyone had attended.\n\nOn 28 November 2014, the Finnish Parliament voted 105-92 to reject the Legal Affairs Committee's recommendation. The legalisation was then approved 101–90 by the Parliament on 12 December, making it the first citizens' initiative to be passed by Parliament. It was signed into law by President Sauli Niinistö on 20 February 2015. Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb showed support for the bill, boosting it as \"a prime example of citizen power.\" Following a number of legislative follow-ups, the law allowing same-sex marriage went into effect on 1 March 2017, making Finland the 12th European nation to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\nJoint adoption for same-sex couples is legal and a law allowing such adoptions went into effect on 1 March 2017. The Finnish Parliament's approval of a same-sex marriage law in late 2014 included provisions allowing same-sex couples to adopt. Stepchild adoption has been legal since 2009. Female couples have more parental rights than male couples, given that equal access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and artificial insemination was legalized in 2006. Surrogacy remains illegal for both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples.\n\nParentage rights for lesbian couples are complex. In 2016, a citizen's initiative calling on Parliament to amend the law so as to allow female same-sex couples to have automatic parentage recognition in law was launched. Previously, such couples had to carry out an intra-family adoption to be recognised as the parents of children conceived via fertility treatment. In February 2018, the Parliament passed a law by a vote of 122-42 that includes same-sex female couples in all rights of maternity pay and full parentage rights. It was signed by the President on 20 April 2018 and went into effect on 1 April 2019.\n\nDiscrimination based on sexual orientation has been criminalized since 1995 and on gender identity or expression since 2005. The \"Act on Equality between Women and Men\" prohibits discrimination on account of sex and gender identity. In 2014, the Finnish Parliament amended the law, establishing further protections in employment, the provision of goods and services, education and health services.\n\nSection 8(1) of the \"Discrimination Act\" (; ) reads as follows:\nIn Finland, people wishing to change their legal gender must be sterilized or \"for some other reason infertile\". In 2012, a possible change of the law was put under consideration by the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. A recommendation from the UN Human Rights Council to eliminate the sterilization requirement was rejected by the Finnish Government in 2017. In October 2017, a bill to amend the law failed because not enough MPs supported the measure. Committee chair Tuula Haatainen said that only 8 out of the 17 committee members supported the bill. The bill was introduced by Left Alliance MP Silvia Modig in 2016 and had gathered 85 MP signatures in the Finnish Parliament.\n\nSakris Kupila, a transgender activist and medical student, was denied a legal gender change after refusing to undergo this process, campaigning along with Amnesty International to demand a change to the law. Transgender people must also receive a mental disorder diagnosis in order to change legal gender.\n\nIn 2019, the newly-elected Rinne Cabinet released their legislative plans for the next 4 years. It includes the removal of the sterilisation requirement for sex changes and banning surgeries on intersex infants.\n\nIn 2019, the newly-elected Rinne Cabinet announced it intends to ban the use of surgeries on intersex children.\n\nIn December 2013, the Finnish Medicines Agency changed its rules on blood donations, repealing a permanent ban for men who have had sex with men (MSM) and setting a one-year deferral period.\n\nThe 2015 Eurobarometer found that 66% of Finns thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 28% were against.\nSupport for same-sex marriage in Finland has grown gradually since the 2000s. A December 2006 EU poll put Finnish support for same-sex marriage at 45%, while an August 2010 survey conducted by Yle put support at 54% with 35% opposing it. In January 2013, a poll conducted by YouGov found that support had climbed to 57%, with 32% opposed and 12% unsure. In the same survey, support for same-sex adoption was 51%, with 36% opposed and 13% unsure. A March 2013 survey by Taloustutkimus found that 58% of Finns supported same-sex marriage. A survey taken in March 2014 by Taloustutkimus found that 65% of Finns supported same-sex marriage, while 27% opposed. A different survey in March 2014 found that 57% supported same-sex adoption, while 36% opposed.\nA gay rights panel discussion aired on YLE2 on October 12, 2010, was followed by an unprecedented high number of people leaving the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. In 2014, thousands of Finns resigned from the Church, following comments made by church officials supporting the same-sex marriage legislation.\n\nThe 2019 Eurobarometer found that 76% of Finns thought that same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, 21% were against.\n\nFinland is often referred to as one of the most LGBT-friendly countries in the world and public acceptance of LGBT people and same-sex relationships is high. The \"Gay Happiness Index\" (GHI), based on a poll by PlanetRomeo, lists Finland as the twelfth happiest country for LGBT people, on par with countries such as New Zealand and Spain. In March 2019, Finland was ranked the fourth-best LGBT-friendly travel destination in the world, tied with several other European countries, including the Netherlands, Austria, Malta and Iceland among others. \n\nSeveral Finnish cities have LGBT organisations which offer help, guidance and counselling concerning coming out, health, sex and relationships. The largest such group is Seta, founded in 1974. Others include Trasek, a transgender and intersex rights group, and Rainbow Families (\"Sateenkaariperheet\", \"Regnbågsfamiljer\"). These groups also campaign for increased legal rights for same-sex couples and transgender individuals, as well as for societal acceptance.\n\nPride parades are held in various cities across Finland, notably in Helsinki, the capital, but also in smaller cities such as Rovaniemi and Kuusamo, in the north of the country. An estimated 100,000 people attended the 2018 Helsinki Pride parade. Prime Minister Antti Rinne participated in its 2019 edition.\n\nIn 2011, Pekka Haavisto, an openly gay member of the Finnish Parliament, was nominated as the Green League candidate for the Finnish presidential election of 2012. In the first round of the election on January 22, 2012, he finished second with 18.8 percent of the votes, but in the run-off on February 5, he lost to the National Coalition Party candidate, former Finance Minister Sauli Niinistö with 37.4 percent of the votes.\n\nIn February 2017, Haavisto announced that he would reprise his candidacy in the 2018 presidential election. The decision came after Haavisto had been approached multiple times by the Green League. In the election, Haavisto placed second with 12.4 percent of the votes, while President Niinistö went on to secure his second term with a majority of votes.\n\n"}

However, the outer membrane lacks lipopolysaccharide. Its shape is a flat wave. It is about 0.3 μm wide and 5 to 20 μm in length.\n\n\"B. burgdorferi\" is a microaerobic, motile spirochete with seven to 11 bundled perisplasmic flagella set at each end that allow the bacterium to move in low- and high-viscosity media alike, which is related to its high virulence factor.\n\n\"B. burgdorferi\" is a slow-growing microaerophilic spirochete with a doubling time of 24 to 48 hours. It is one of the few bacteria that can survive without iron, having replaced all of its iron-sulfur cluster enzymes with enzymes that use manganese, thus avoiding the problem many pathogenic bacteria face in acquiring iron.\n\n\"B. burgdorferi\" circulates between \"Ixodes\" ticks and a vertebrate host in an enzootic cycle. \"B. burgdorferi\" living in a tick cannot be passed to its offspring. Therefore, tick larvae must feed on the blood of an infected animal to acquire \"B. burgdorferi\", which ends up in the midgut. The spirochetes survive as the larvae molts into a nymph and persist in the nutrient-poor midgut as the nymph overwinters. Infected nymphs then transmit \"B. burgdorferi\" by feeding on another vertebrate to complete the cycle. Ticks can transmit \"B. burgdorferi\" to humans, but humans are dead-end hosts, unlikely to continue the life cycle of the spirochete. Nymphs molt into adult ticks, which usually feed on larger mammals that are not able to support the survival of \"B. burgdorferi\".\n\nLyme disease is a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted by the \"Ixodes\" tick (also the vector for \"Babesia\" and \"Anaplasma\"). The infected nymphal tick transmits \"B. burgdorferi\" via its saliva to the human during its blood meal.\n\nClinical presentation of Lyme disease is best known for the characteristic bull's-eye rash (also known as \"erythema chronicum migrans\") but can also include myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, arrythmia, arthritis, arthralgia, meningitis, neuropathies, and facial nerve palsy depending on the stage of infection. \n\n\"B. burgdorferi\" infections have been found in possible association with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCLs), where a review of the primary literature has, as of 2010, noted that most of the PCBLCs examined have been 'unresponsive' to antibiotics; hence, as in the case of \"Chlamydophila psittaci\" association with ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the working conclusion was that \"if \"B. burgdorferi\" is truly associated with PCBCL, then there is wide geographic variability and other factors are probably involved\".\n\nProgression of the disease follows 3 stages.\n\nStage 1 is known as the Early Localized stage and occurs approximately 3 days - 1 month after inoculation. It affects the local area around the bite and is characterized by local swelling and / or a red \"bull's-eye\" rash (also known as \"erythema chronicum migrans\") seen as an erythematous circle encircling a defined center that expands outward. It can get as large as 15 cm in diameter. Once the rash starts to subside the first symptoms can manifest as \"flu-like\" symptoms. At this stage, antibiotics are most efficacious to prevent further growth and symptoms of the disease before the major symptoms manifest.\n\nStage 2 is known as the Early Disseminated stage and occurs weeks - months after infection if left untreated. The bacteria spreads via the blood through the body to affect the organs. It often presents with general symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy as well as the organ-specific symptoms. It can affect the \"heart\" causing \"myocarditis\" and \"arrythmias\" such as Atrioventricular blocks (which if significant enough may require the insertion of a pacemaker). It can affect the musculoskeletal system causing non-inflammatory transient arthritis and / or arthralgias. It can affect the nervous system manifesting as facial paralysis (Bell's palsy, classically bilateral), fatigue, and loss of memory. \n\nStage 3 is known as the Late Disseminated stage and occurs months - years after the initial infection. Effects of the 3 stage include encephalitis or meningitis.. as well as migratory arthropathies (most commonly of the knee).\nAnaplasmosis and babesiosis are also common tick-borne pathogens carried by the Ixodes tick that infect humans similarly to Borrelia burgdorferi. Consequently, it is possible for an Ixodes tick to coinfect a host with either two or all other diseases. When a host is coinfected, the combined effects of the diseases act synergistically, often proving to cause worse symptoms than a single infection alone Coinfected humans tend to display a more severe manifestation of Lyme disease. In addition, they tend to acquire a wider range of secondary symptoms, such as influenza-like symptoms. More studies and research must be done to determine the synergistic effect of co-infection and its effect on the human body.\n\nSo far, there are three factors that may contribute to the severity of the clinical manifestation of Lyme Disease. The presence of ribosomal spacers, plasmids, and the outer surface protein C (OspC) are indicators of the severity of the infection. Additionally, humans, themselves, vary in their response to the infection. The variation in response leads to different clinical manifestations and different infections to different organs.\n\nAfter the pathogen is transmitted, it will acclimate to the mammalian conditions. \"Borrelia burgdorferi\" will change its glycoproteins and proteases on its plasma membrane to facilitate its dissemination throughout the blood. While infecting, \"B. burgdorferi\" will express proteins that will interact with endothelial cells, platelets, chondrocytes, and the extracellular matrix. This interaction inhibits proper function of the infected areas, leading to the pathological manifestations of Lyme disease. In response, the host will initiate an inflammatory response to attempt to remove the infection.\n\n\"Borrelia burgdorferi\", also, expresses at least seven plasminogen binding proteins for interference of factor H at the activation level. This is part of a complement system evasion strategy that leads to downstream blocking of immune response.\n\nIn addition, \"Borrelia burgdorferi\" has a strategy to directly inhibit the classical pathway of complement system. A borrelial lipoprotein BBK32, expressed on the surface of \"Borrelia burgdorferi\", binds the initiating protease complex C1 of the classical pathway. More specifically, BBK32 interacts with C1r subunit of C1. C-terminal domain of the BBK32 protein mediates the binding. As a result, C1 is trapped in an inactive form. \n\n\"B. burgdorferi\" (B31 strain) was the third microbial genome ever sequenced, following the sequencing of both \"Haemophilus influenzae\" and \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" in 1995. Its linear chromosome contains 910,725 base pairs and 853 genes. The sequencing method used was whole genome shotgun. The sequencing project, published in \"Nature\" in 1997 and \"Molecular Microbiology\" in 2000, was conducted at The Institute for Genomic Research. Overall, \"B. burgdorferi\"'s genome oddly consists of one megabase chromosome and a variety of circular and linear plasmids ranging in size from 9 to 62 kilobases. The megabase chromosome, unlike many other eubacteria, has no relation to either the bacteria's virulence or to the host-parasite interaction. Some of the plasmids are necessary for the \"B. burgdorferi\" life cycle but not for propagation of the bacteria in culture.\n\nThe genomic variations of \"B. burgdorferi\" contribute to varying degrees of infection and dissemination. Each genomic group has varying antigens on its membrane receptor, which are specific to the infection of the host. One such membrane receptor is the surface protein OspC. The OspC surface protein is shown to be a strong indicator of the identification of genomic classification and the degree of dissemination. Varying number of OspC loci are indications and determinants for the variations of \"B.\" \"burgdorferi\". The surface protein is also on the forefront of current vaccine research for Lyme disease via \"Borrelia\".\n\nGenetically diverse \"B. burgdorferi\" strains, as defined by the sequence of \"ospC\", are maintained within the Northeastern United States. Balancing selection may act upon \"ospC\" or a nearby sequence to maintain the genetic variety of \"B. burgdorferi\". Balancing selection is the process by which multiple versions of a gene are kept within the gene pool at unexpectedly high frequencies. Two major models that control the selection balance of \"B.burgdorferi\" is negative frequency-dependent selection and multiple-niche polymorphism. These models may explain how \"B. burgdorferi\" have diversified, and how selection may have affected the distribution of the \"B. burgdorferi\" variants, or the variation of specific traits of the species, in certain environments.\n\nIn negative frequency-dependent selection, rare and uncommon variants will have a selective advantage over variants that are very common in an environment. For \"B. burgdorferi\", low-frequency variants will be advantageous because potential hosts will be less likely to mount an immunological response to the variant-specific OspC outer protein.\n\nEcological niches are all of the variables in an environment, such as the resources, competitors, and responses, that contribute to the organism's fitness. Multiple-niche polymorphism states that diversity is maintained within a population due to the varying amount of possible niches and environments. Therefore, the more various niches the more likelihood of polymophrism and diversity. For \"B. burgdorferi\", varying vertebrae niches, such deer and mice, can affect the overall balancing selection for variants.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2142820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142820", "title": "Charles and Lee-Lee Chan", "text": "Charles and Lee-Lee Chan\n\nTheir story was made into a 2013 feature film \"A Tale of Three Cities\" directed by Mabel Cheung.\n\nAccording to Charles' father, he still needed discipline when Charles returned to Nanjing at the age of 20. His grandfather was a good friend of Chinese National Revolutionary Army General Ku Chu-tung (Gu Zhutong, Chinese: 顧祝同) and after displaying his martial arts skills, Charles became General Gu's orderly which was similar to being a personal guard according to Charles. General Gu later became Chief of Staff to General Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nGeneral Gu had many armed guards and Charles was also given a rifle of his own. He lost his job as an orderly when he accidentally pulled the trigger of his automatic rifle which startled him causing him to drop it. The rifle continued to fire rounds as it spun on the ground.\n\nCharles returned home and eventually found employment on a Mitsubishi cargo ship in Wuhan.\n\nOf the seven general maintenance workers in his group, he became the leader. This group of seven also openly traded merchandise without official permits. Linen was especially very expensive in Nanjing, so they bought the linen in Wuhu and shipped it to Nanjing. Once the linen was in Nanjing, it was traded for salt. According to Charles, when Japanese workers arrived in Nanjing to seek employment, they felt they were not given any benefits and accused Charles and his group of smuggling and they were arrested by Japanese authorities. Upon the fourth day of their imprisonment, he and his group had their hands tied behind their backs and were taken to witness an execution. What they saw caused them to literally faint, lose their appetites and experience restless sleep. One week later, they were taken again to witness another execution. Charles, while recalling this horrific experience in the film documentary, \"Traces of a Dragon: Jackie Chan and his Lost Family\", said that he and the other six workers in his group, upon witnessing another execution, became like zombies.\n\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in July 1937. Soon, under the pretext of creating a \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\", the Japanese Imperial Army launched an all-out invasion of South-East Asia, but their primary target was always China.\n\nThrough political connections, a relative of Charles pleaded with the Japanese authorities to release him from prison. Of the seven workers, only five came out alive, among them was Charles. Deciding to quit his job on the cargo ship, Charles returned to General Gu, who was Dai Li's boss, to ask for help. This time, General Gu got Charles a job in the Intelligence Bureau of the Administration Office as a Secret Agent of the First War Zone. According to Charles, the Nationalist Government was corrupt and currency became less and less usable as even the price of a stick of fried bread (Youtiao) skyrocketed into extremely unreasonable prices.\n\nCharles then led his entire unit of 38 men to the headquarters in Shanghai where they all intended to formally hand in their resignations. However, being the leader of this unit made him the target of two assassination attempts, one of which occurred on the way to the headquarters in Shanghai. While descending down some stairs, someone shouted that he had too much power and shot him. The bullet went through the upper calf of his leg. Later, someone shot Charles from behind and this time the bullet took off a piece of his scalp near the crown of his head. Charles expressed that he believes it was Communists who tried to kill him as he was a Nationalist.\n\nIn the meantime, the Japanese Army were taking the coastal cities of China with overwhelming force causing the Chinese population to continually move further and further inland. Charles fled to Anhui, but it was too devastated from the Japanese air raids for him to stay. Both of his parents and his sister were killed in these air raids. He then fled to Chongqing (Chungking), but returned three or four months later. Living alone among the ruins in Anhui, he met his first wife and they had two sons, Fang Shide (房仕德) and Fang Shisheng (房仕勝). Eventually, they moved to Wuhu.\n\nWhen the older son, Shide, was seven, and the younger son, Shisheng, was two, Charles' wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer and was bed-ridden for three years while in constant pain. Opium, when it could be smuggled undetected by authorities, was often used as a pain-killer, but Charles did not know how to prepare it and hired someone for this task. This caused him to eventually go bankrupt. His first wife died of her illness in 1947.\n\nAs the Communists and Nationalists clashed, the Chinese Civil War broke out and the Communists eventually won. In the meantime, due to Charles having been a former Secret Agent for the Nationalists, his life was in danger and he felt he had no other choice but to leave his two young sons behind and flee Wuhu. Charles left without telling them good-bye or where he was going. After dodging Communists, he ended up in Shanghai at the age of 29. According to his two sons, when they woke up the next morning, their father was simply gone. Without parents, a policeman found them and the two sons were taken care of secretly by Charles' friends. These friends feared that if they were discovered to be helping the sons of a former Nationalist Secret Agent, they could be arrested by the Communists. Charles expressed that from that day until the day he met them again in 1985, he worried about his sons and wondered if they were still alive.\n\nCharles Chan died at the age of 93 on 26 February 2008 in Hong Kong. Family members, including his grandson Jaycee Chan were at his bedside. His son Jackie was unable to be there due to filming commitments, but he was with his father during the Chinese New Year period and said on his website that he knew that might be the last time he saw his father.\n\nCharles Chan was interred next to his wife in the Gungahlin Cemetery in Canberra on 8 March 2008. Jackie Chan, the US ambassador Robert McCallum and former ACT chief ministers Kate Carnell and Gary Humphries were in attendance.\n\nLee-Lee Chan (陳莉莉; born as 陳月榮 (Chén Yuèróng)), also known as Lily Chan, was born circa 1916. Lee-Lee's parents owned a grocery store and her first husband worked as a shoe-maker, then later worked at a railroad station. Her first husband was killed from bombs from Japanese air raids in Wuhan and at the age of 28, she was left to single-handedly raise her two daughters, Yulan (who was 12 years old when her father died) and Guilan (four at the time).\n\nWithout her husband's income, Lee-Lee's mother-in-law wanted her to be sold to a store owner to have money for her daughters. Despite her arguments and refusal to be sold, it was already in the process of being arranged, so in desperation, she took her daughters to her mother's house to live. Soon afterwards, Wuhan was invaded by Japanese soldiers who, according to Yulan, would rape any woman they caught.\n\nLee-Lee left Wuhan not only for the fear of being raped, but for lack of money, went to Shanghai at the age of 29 and at the train station, she told her daughters that she would be back. According to Guilan, she told this lie so that they would not feel sad. Yulan, at 12 years old, had to work in a child labour factory to help her grandmother to care for herself and her sister.\n\nWhile in Shanghai, Lee-Lee heard that trafficking opium was lucrative, so she took a risk and bought some opium. That day, the port was under inspection and the officer in charge of inspecting every passenger was Charles who found the opium Lee-Lee was concealing. He confiscated it and was about to arrest her however, he took pity on her when he noticed the blue flower in her hair. According to the autobiography, \"I Am Jackie Chan; My Life in Action\", during the war in China, a white flower in one's hair signified that one had lost their parents, a blue flower meant that they lost their children and/or husband. Charles asked Lee-Lee about her situation and on hearing it, he let her go, returning the opium back to her.\n\nLee-Lee turned to gambling, successfully. She won so many times, that all over Shanghai, she was known as \"Big Sister\" and was treated with utmost respect. However, her luck eventually changed and she resorted to pawning all of her jewellery and clothes. Meanwhile, she and Charles had become great friends, and when he found out about her pawning her belongings, he got them all back for her. He also belonged to a street gang called the \"Shandong Gang\". Lee-Lee never gambled again, but her friendship with Charles grew stronger.\n\nBy studying English, Lee-Lee found employment as a maid in a foreigner's home and worked extremely hard.\n\nLee-Lee Chan died on 28 February 2002, in Canberra, Australia aged around 85 and was buried in the Gungahlin Cemetery.\n\nThe People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 by Mao Zedong. Many Nationalists fled to Taiwan or Hong Kong. Charles, to further hide from the Communists, changed his name from Fang Daolong to Chan Zhiping, the surname Chan was much more common and was also Lee-Lee's surname, and he joined the exodus to Hong Kong. Lee-Lee arrived in Hong Kong a couple of years later in 1951.\n\nA friend of Charles found him employment at the French Consulate in Hong Kong. Charles did not know how to cook at that time, and became an odd job man; doing things from cleaning to gardening. After a while of physical labour with little pay, he asked to be taught how to cook. Charles became a chef at the French Embassy which earned him a higher salary. Charles and Lee Lee had since found each other in Hong Kong and on 7 April 1954, they had a son named, Kong-sang Chan (which means, \"born in Hong Kong\" Chan), better known as Jackie Chan.\nThe family of three lived in the servants quarters of the French Embassy. Lee-Lee had found employment there as a maid. According to countless sources, Jackie was a mischievous child who did not like school. At the age of 7, he was enrolled for the maximum 10 years at the China Drama Academy under the cruel Dickensian head teacher, Master Yu Jim-Yuen where he learned the skills of Chinese Opera such as martial arts, acrobatics, singing and dancing with very little emphasis on academics.\n\nThe 1960s were still financially challenging in Hong Kong and when Charles had the opportunity to leave there with Charles Greene, the Marshall of the French Embassy, to become a chef at the US Embassy in Australia, he did not hesitate to take the new position. After he had earned enough money for an airline ticket for Lee-Lee, he sent for her which meant that after she joined him Australia and also found employment at the US Embassy as a maid, Jackie was left in the care of Master Yu Jim-Yuen.\n\nAfter Jackie graduated from the China Drama Academy, Charles bought him an apartment in Hong Kong. According to Charles, it cost he and Lee-Lee all of their savings plus tips. When Jackie learned of this, his resentment towards his parents for leaving him behind in Hong Kong disappeared as he realised they were working so hard for their son and his future.\n\nIn 1985, through the help of a friend who worked at the Chinese Embassy in Australia, who was also from Shandong, China, Charles found his two sons in China. They were living in Wuhan in Hubei province. Their reunion took place in Guangzhou, China and the sons cried upon seeing their father again and they said that they had suffered a lot. The older son, Shide, is a postman, and the younger son, Shisheng, works on a pig farm.\n\nCharles visited his two sons and their families in Anhui as often as he was able to (at 89 years old in 2005) and he has re-established his position as the patriarch of the Fang family and provided money to renovate the ancestral hall there. He also updated the genealogy by adding Jackie's real name into the records as 房仕龍 (Fáng Shìlóng or Fong Si Lung). The entire Fang clan has been re-connected.\n\nJackie, at the time \"Traces of a Dragon: Jackie Chan and his Lost Family\" was made, had still not met his half brothers, his father's sons, but he has met his half sisters, Lee-Lee's daughters as they would often visit their mother in Australia as did Jackie when his parents used to live there.\n\n"}

Before this, the team selection was made by coaches and boardroom members. Theo Kelly had been club secretary before his appointment as manager in May 1939 and had been closely involved in team matters, so there is some dispute when he actually took over.

While he was club secretary Theo Kelly devised the club badge and motto.\n\nThe Football League First Division of 1938-39 had already been won by Everton by the time that Kelly was appointed as full-time manager. The League was then suspended for seven seasons during the war though some matches were played with Kelly in charge.\n\nAfter the war Kelly disagreed with Joe Mercer. Kelly accused Mercer of not trying in an international against Scotland, but in reality Mercer had sustained a severe cartilage injury. Even after consulting an orthopaedic specialist, Kelly refused to believe him and Mercer had to pay for the surgery himself (after 14 years with the club). Understandably upset, Mercer moved in 1946 for £9,000 to Arsenal, although he commuted from Liverpool. Theo Kelly brought Mercer's boots to the transfer negotiations to prevent Mercer having a reason to go back to say goodbye to the other players at Everton.\n\nKelly was also unable to persuade Tommy Lawton to stay and he attempted to sell T. G. Jones to A.S. Roma to raise £15,000, but exchange control prevented the transfer. Many players saw Kelly as a remote, autocratic and petty figure. Dixie Dean said that the main reason for leaving Everton in 1937 was Theo Kelly. Kelly distrusted players bought on the transfer market and so the playing resources were quickly depleted.\n\nAfter two poor seasons (finishing 10th and 14th) and a poor start to the 1948-49 season in which Everton finished 18th, Kelly resigned as manager in September 1948 and reverted to being club secretary. Cliff Britton replaced him as manager, though relegation in 1950/51 can be partly traced back to Kelly's period as manager. Kelly was better known for his administrative skills and to his credit he left the club in a better financial state.\n\n"}

He made a substantial contribution to the literary genre of political biography.\n\nEducated at Rokeby School, at the time in Wimbledon, Marlborough College and Worcester College, Oxford, where he took a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics and a BPhil in politics. In 1970, he was appointed as a lecturer in the politics department of the University of Newcastle, where he also took his PhD. In the February 1974 General Election, Pimlott contested Arundel on behalf of the Labour Party, and Cleveland and Whitby the following October. Having lost on both occasions, he also contested the 1979 election, after which he left the North East to take up a research post at the London School of Economics, moving to a lectureship at Birkbeck College, London in 1981.\n\nDuring 1987–88, he was Political Editor of the \"New Statesman\" magazine and took on the post of Professor of Contemporary History at Birkbeck in 1988. For the following two years, Pimlott was responsible, with friends, for the short-lived journal \"Samizdat\".\n\nAside from his attempts at a Parliamentary career in the 1970s, not to mention his tenure as Chairman of the Fabian Society in 1993/1994, Pimlott is best remembered for his works of political biography including lives of Hugh Dalton (1985), Harold Wilson (1992), and a study of Queen Elizabeth II (1996). His study of Dalton won him the Whitbread Prize. His other books include \"Labour And The Left In The 1930s\" (1977), \"The Trade Unions In British Politics\" (with Chris Cook, 1982), \"Fabian Essays In Socialist Thought\" (1984), \"The Alternative\" (with Tony Wright and Tony Flower, 1990), \"Frustrate Their Knavish Tricks\" (1994) and \"Governing London\" (with Nirmala Rao, 2002).\n\nMany of Pimlott's theses have stood the test of time, even if they were marginally controversial when originally published. His studies of the 1930s Labour left, the life of Harold Wilson and the constitutional effect of the monarchy in post-war Britain are said to have made his reputation as a biographer and even bestowed some additional credibility upon the subjects, all of which have received critical accounts under the pen of others. Pimlott sincerely believed and argued consistently that the post-war consensus in British politics was a red-herring.\n\nIn 1996 his works were recognised with a Fellowship of the British Academy. At the time of his death from leukemia in 2004, he was Warden of Goldsmiths, University of London (since 1998). He was married to Jean Seaton, who lectures on communications and the media at the University of Westminster. In 2005 the college named a major new Will Alsop-designed building on its New Cross site in his honour and also the same year the Fabian Society and \"The Guardian\" inaugurated the first annual Ben Pimlott Prize for Political Writing.\n\n"}

She grew up in Sundsvall and started to sing in choirs at an early age, working, among others, with Swedish conductor Kjell Lönnå. By the end of the 1980s she toured with the group \"Just For Fun\".\n\nHer career as a performer of musical theatre began with small-scale concert presentations of \"Chess\", in which she sang the role of Florence. She took part in a number of smaller productions, including \"Little Dorrit\" in Enskede and the musical \"Elvira Madigan\" at Malmö Music Theatre in Malmö, Sweden.\n\nHer big breakthrough occurred in 1995 when she created the title role in Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus' \"Kristina från Duvemåla\", which she played on and off for nearly four years (during the musical's entire run). \"Minneapolis Star and Tribune\" in its review of the concert version of the musical performed by the original cast in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1996 described her as \"extraordinary\" (14 October 1996, page 05B). In 1998, she played Hodel in \"Fiddler on the Roof\", taking a break from \"Kristina\". In 2000, she returned to Malmö Music Theatre to portray the role of Fantine in \"Les Misérables\", and in 2002 she created the role of Florence in the reconceived Swedish production of \"Chess\", opposite original London star Tommy Körberg as Anatoly. Having left this production upon closing in 2003, Sjöholm took part in Chinarevyn, a revue starring many well-known Swedish performers including Magnus Härenstam, Lasse Berghagen, Loa Falkman, Sissela Kyle and herself.\n\nHelen Sjöholm has also toured extensively throughout Sweden with Georg Wadenius and Martin Östergren and she has released two albums, \"Visor\" (2002) (a collection of more or less well-known Swedish folk songs in new arrangements by Östergren) and \"Genom varje andetag\" (2003) (featuring music and lyrics by jazz pianist Anders Widmark).\n\nShe first appeared on the big screen in 1999, appearing in \"Där regnbågen slutar\" by Richard Hobert. In 2004, she returned to the movies, portraying the role of Gabriella in Kay Pollak's much-debated \"Så som i himmelen\" (\"As It Is in Heaven\").\n\nShe is also a frequent performer with Benny Andersson's band, Benny Anderssons Orkester (BAO), singing mostly dance music and music by Andersson. Additionally, she has appeared in numerous gala concerts including \"Rhapsody in Rock\".\n\nOn 4 July 2009, Helen performed as lead female singer with the Benny Andersson Band (the name by which BAO is known outside Sweden) at a free concert on Hampstead Heath in London to mark Sweden's presidency of the EU. The concert comprised a mixture of BAO classics, traditional Swedish folk, Bach, Shostakovich, old British pub singalong Roll Out the Barrell, ABBA and even \"Cadillac\" by the Hep Stars.\n\nAn English album by the Benny Andersson Band was released on 6 July 2009 with some of the Swedish original songs having been translated into English and a new song (\"Story of a Heart\") which is also the title of the album. The song was first played on 25 May 2009 on BBC Radio 2 on \"The Ken Bruce show presented by Zoë Ball\" and after received significant airplay on the station, including being added to the station's A-list.\n\nOn 11 June 2009, it was announced that Helen would perform in the English version of \"Kristina från Duvemåla\" (outside Sweden called \"Kristina\") in a concert version of the musical at Carnegie Hall, New York, on 23 and 24 September 2009. She sang as her previous title character while Russell Watson sang as Karl Oskar. She received standing ovations on both nights for her rendition of \"You Have to Be There\" (\"Du måste finnas\"). The concerts themselves in the main received rave reviews, with a CD release of the live recording issued in May 2010.\n\nHit recordings include \"Du måste finnas\" (\"You Have to Be There\") from the symphonic musical \"Kristina från Duvemåla\" (\"Kristina\"), \"Vår sista dans\" (\"If this is Our Last Dance\") with Benny Andersson's orkester, \"Gabriellas sång\" (from film \"Så som i himmelen\" a.k.a. \"As It Is In Heaven\"), \"Jag vet vad han vill\" (a.k.a. \"I Know Him So Well\") from musical \"Chess\", \"Det är vi ändå\" (with Tommy Körberg and Benny Anderssons Orkester), and \"Du är min man\" (\"You Are My Man\") with Benny Anderssons Orkester, among others.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2142874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142874", "title": "Ogdru Jahad", "text": "Ogdru Jahad\n\nThe Ogdru Jahad are fictional supervillains in Mike Mignola's \"Hellboy\" comic series. They are the Dragon of Revelation, and are destined to bring about the end of the world. Though the Ogdru Jahad are the central antagonists of the franchise, they are not themselves active, their release from imprisonment instead being the object of many other villains' plans. They were imprisoned in their Golden Cocoons by the Right Hand of Doom shortly after the creation of Earth, but not before they spawned 369 children, known as the Ogdru Hem.\n\nMostly inspired by the Great Old Ones of H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos (with some ancient Egyptian and Babylonian influences as well) the Ogdru Jahad are serpentine/crustacean entities which once resided on, and presided over, Earth. They are pitiless, chaotic, bent on destruction and subjugation and often so horrific in appearance that the mere sight of one of them sometimes induced madness.\nThey are listed as follows:\n\n\nIn the beginning of time, God created an order of spirits. Of these, many of the greater spirits were sent to newborn Earth to oversee it as Watchers. After a time, one Watcher named Anum \"...dared to take fire from the air, and with it, fashioned out of mud the dragon (...)\". The Ogdru Jahad is thus made up of the four classical elements. The other Watchers set their seals on the Ogdru Jahad and yet the entities did not come to life until nightfall. By then, the awakened Ogdru Jahad are instilled with purpose and function as they instantly give birth to the Ogdru Hem, who become Earth's first lifeforms.\n\nThe Watchers, upon seeing the creation of these abominations, went to war with them. The Ogdru Hem were eventually all disposed of, with many of them barely clinging to existence in some fashion, with the Ogdru Jahad sealed by their creator in a prison of crystal and placed in the heart of the abyss. The other Watchers, however, turn on Anum and destroyed him. After that, God looked down in fury on what had happened, and exacted his retribution on the Watchers for botching their task: some were cast down into the pit, while others were stranded on Earth to breed monsters. Eventually, lesser spirits were given form by God and took up residence on Earth as the first men, the Golden People of Hyperborea.\n\nAs it turned out, Anum's right hand survived and was found by the Hyperboreans as it became a holy relic and was attached to a great statue at the behest of their king Thoth. Holding three Watchers captive in a secret garden, Thoth learned the inner workings of the universe and only shared a small fraction of his knowledge to the people. 10,000 years later, Hyperboria's downfall began when Hecate used Thoth to find the Watchers, drain them of their blood, and reveal all their secrets to the people. Though Thoth cursed Hecate in her serpentine form, her actions led to Hyperboria's corruption as they begin to worship the Black Goddess, one of many epithets that Hecate came to be called, and commit atrocities in her name. These actions led to the statue coming to life and slaughtering the many Hyperboreans before finally hurling itself over a cliff. The Last Glacial Period then enables the raise of humanity, the second race, while the Hyperboreans were divided into two groups. While one branch who gave their successors knowledge before departing, those among the Hyperboreans who continue to worship Hecate took refuge underground and became extinct at the hands of their corrupted slaves in their attempt to reclaim their former glory. Anum's hand eventually was recovered and ended up in Hell. As the hand is the key to freeing the Ogdru Jahad from their prison, which would usher in a new and final race of men, it came to be known as \"\"the Right Hand of Doom\"\".\n\nWhen Hellboy was born, the Right Hand of Doom was grafted onto the newborn's arm by Azzael before being sent away from Hell and summoned to Earth years later by Rasputin. Hellboy is aware that he must keep the hand, as it would be more dangerous to try to rid himself of it. Attempts have already been made to separate Hellboy from his arm, both to protect the world and to hasten its destruction. Hellboy believes he is the best protection the arm can have.\n\nWhile certain events have made it clear that the Right Hand of Doom is the Key to releasing the Ogdru Jahad, the actions of Herman von Klempt and the frog monsters suggest that there are other conditions that need to be met. The summonings of the Conqueror Worm and Katha-Hem were meant to lead to the Ogdru Jahad's freedom, yet Hellboy's right hand had no role in these schemes and were thus considered doomed to failure. Even Nimue being possessed by the Ogdru Jahad to serve as their vessel and conduit to prematurely enter the world also ended in failure yet began the series of events that would conclude with the end of humanity.\n\nBy the end of B.P.R.D, Hell on Earth, the Ogdru Jahad are on the verge of victory, with one of them, namely Nunn-Jahad, landing on Earth, in Argent, Kansas devastating the surrounding area for miles. It immediately proceeded to spawn a number of Ogdru Hem as both the SSS and the B.P.R.D. mobilize to try to fight it. Elizabeth Sherman and Johann Kraus succeeded in destroying the Ogdru Hem but are unable to damage the dragon itself, forcing a retreat. Nunn-Jahad's arrival also connected it to the psychic network that powers The Black Flame. After the Black Flame is defeated, Nunn-Jahad begins moving, bringing with it a storm of fire and lightning. It proceeded to spew out dozens more Ogdru Hem by the hour, overwhelming Liz and Johann's attempts to stymie the tide. The US military tries to fire every available nuclear warhead at it, but without any effect. It eventually passes by B.P.R.D. headquarters and destroys it with a fireball that kills Katherine Corrigan and Panya. Afterwards it was confronted by several Watchers from Hell, who have been summoned by the demon Varvara; however, despite their efforts, the Ogdru Jahad incinerated them. Nunn-Jahad was finally killed when Johann channels the infinite power of Vril to shatter it, sacrificing himself in the process. With its death, Ogdru Hem around the globe cease moving or showing any signs of life, giving the world a bit of a breather.\n\nFrom the varied attempts of the comic's villains to free the Ogdru Jahad, it is readily apparent that the release of the Ogdru Jahad is closely tied to the fall of mankind. Whether the fall of man causes the release or quickly follows it is not known with any certainty. All the characters attempting to liberate it agree that the Ogdru Jahad will do something akin to \"burning the earth to a cinder\" so it is possible they are all referring to some common vision of the dragon's release but are guessing at how the prophecy is fulfilled.\n\nImmortal and vastly powerful beyond description, sometimes referred to as a single entity, the Ogdru Jahad's motivations may be impossible to represent in human terms. As such, the human and quasi-human inhabitants of the Hellboy universe have expressed a variety of opinions on what the Ogdru Jahad desire beyond freedom, which it desires above all other things.\n\nBeyond the basic premise of seeking freedom and then burning the earth, there is much dissent as to precisely what the Ogdru Jahad desire. The aliens that watch the cosmic prison of the Ogdru Jahad apparently perceive Earth as a focal point necessary to maintaining the prison. If the Ogdru Jahad are released, they will destroy Earth and then the entire Universe. Herman von Klempt believes that once man has been destroyed, the three hundred and sixty-nine Ogdru Hem will rise up from their prisons, free the Ogdru Jahad and burn the Earth to ashes. Similarly, the Bog Roosh was plagued with dreams in which Hellboy's hand is taken and used to free the Ogdru Jahad, who then burn the earth to cinders. Rasputin, on the other hand, seems convinced that the desire of the Ogdru Jahad is to create a new, perfect world out of the ashes of the old one, where the final race of man will live. He tells Inger von Klempt that her grandfather was unable to see beyond the destruction of the human race, and that a new Eden does indeed await the final race of man. Hecate also strongly implies that there will be a \"\"new world to come\"\" during a conversation with Rasputin in the Conqueror Worm epilogue, but mentions that she cannot see that far ahead, and that death could await them just as easily. In \"The Third Wish\", the Daoine Sidhe explicitly state that it is prophesied that a new world shall rise from the old due to the Right Hand of Doom.\n\nAfter being imprisoned in the void, the Ogdru Jahad turned their considerable forces toward finding a way to escape their confinement and exact their revenge on the world. Since they are trapped in deep space, their contact with humanity is sparse at best. However, since the Ogdru Jahad are supremely powerful psychic entities, they have been able to establish contact with mortals on Earth in order to coerce them into doing their bidding.\n\nIn Austria in 1939, the Nazis attempted to open relations with space-borne monsters by sending them the corpse of one of their greatest scientists, Dr. Ernst Oeming, in the hopes that the creatures would use it as a vessel and return to Earth. On March 20, 1939, even though the mission, which took place at Hunte Castle, was interrupted by the arrival of Lobster Johnson and a detachment of American soldiers, the launch went ahead as planned. The castle, however, was left in ruins, and all parties were killed except for Herman von Klempt. The creatures received the spacecraft, and responded by placing one of their own inside Oeming's lifeless body.\n\nAfter the events of \"Wake the Devil,\" Herman von Klempt is provided with the truth about the Oeming mission and the details of the return of the capsule. The invisible space monsters showed von Klempt the destruction that would result from releasing the worm they had planted within Oeming's body. Once the world had been overtaken by the worm, the Ogdru Hem would be released from their prisons, and they would, in turn, release the Ogdru Jahad, who will reduce the world to ashes. Despairing over the failures of his best laid plans, and inspired by Rasputin posing as the angel of death, von Klempt returned to Hunte Castle and set to work.\n\nVon Klempt succeeded in bringing Oeming's capsule back to Earth, and from it rose a massive juggernaut known as the Conqueror Worm. Spewing forth a noxious gas, the worm turned von Klempt's human agents into frog monsters, then devoured them immediately to feed its insatiable hunger. Only quick intervention by Hellboy and Roger the Homunculus, aided by the ghost of Lobster Johnson and a mysterious alien, managed to halt the worm's feasting march. Herman von Klempt watched in dismay as his plans were foiled, only to be grabbed by Roger and heaved off a cliff to his death. But Von Klempt's head survived, retrieved by Landis Pope of the Zinco Corporation before being spirited away by Kroenen and then revived by Varvara.\n\nAfter being poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, castrated, and hurled into the icy waters of the Neva, Rasputin was contacted by the Ogdru Jahad. They sent him visions explaining their nature and what they wanted from him, namely, to release them from their prison, help bring about the end of the world, and make way for a new world. Uncertain of how to proceed, Rasputin waited to be contacted again.\n\nEventually, after years of silence and waiting, Rasputin was approached by Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel of Nazi Germany. Recognizing this as an opportunity to acquire the resources needed to establish a stronger connection to the Ogdru Jahad, Rasputin joined forces with the Nazis and soon assembled a team of Nazi occultists, consisting primarily of Ilsa Haupstein, Leopold Kurtz, and Prof. Doktor Karl Ruprecht Kroenen. This team was known as Project Ragna Rok. On December 23, 1944, Rasputin and his colleagues opened a doorway into the void, and Hellboy was brought forth, albeit unbeknownst to the Nazis (but not to Rasputin). After this apparent failure, the Allies won World War II and Rasputin and his allies scattered. Rasputin himself traveled to a hidden temple in the distant Arctic dedicated to the Ogdru Jahad. Inside, he sat at the foot of a statue of Sadu Hem for almost fifty years until he was disturbed by Professor Bruttenholm, providing a catalyst for his, and Sadu Hem's, sudden re-awakenings. Ilsa, Kroenen, and Kurtz relocated to the frigid north of Norway and cryogenically froze themselves until Rasputin's return, though they did not revive themselves until after Rasputin's failure at Cavendish Hall.\nIn the film, Rasputin was sucked into the portal and was seemingly destroyed, not to be seen again for 60 years. Only 2 members of the Nazis occultist team, Ilsa Haupstein and Kroenen survived.\n\nIn \"Wake the Devil,\" while trying to strike back at Hellboy by using Ilsa's connection to a Romanian vampire, Rasputin brings Hellboy into the clutches of the Hecate. Hecate threatens Hellboy with his destiny, and in the end Hellboy prevails. Retreating to the abode of his grandmother, Baba Yaga, Rasputin tries to come to terms with the fact that the Ogdru Jahad manipulated him. He realizes that the Ogdru Jahad were behind his latest venture, though he alone is responsible for the failure. He also must deal with the fact that rather than saving Ilsa, he instead sacrificed her to Hecate, who would use Ilsa's corpse (and the iron maiden that contained it) as her new body.\n\nMoreover, Hecate tells Rasputin that he had no hope in trying to awake the Dragon in the events of \"Seed of Destruction\" - the only power that can free the Ogdru Jahad is Hellboy's right hand, and Rasputin is nothing more than a tool with which to manipulate and maneuver Hellboy. Upon hearing this, Rasputin loses control and attacks Hecate, who virtually destroys him, leaving nothing more than a tiny shard of his soul for the Baba Yaga to preserve in an acorn shell.\n\nA former love of Merlin before she used his knowledge to imprison him in his grave, Nimue lost her mind and became a devout worshipper of the Ogdru Jahad before the other witches killed her and eventually placed her severed body parts in a box that is buried within the earth. However, during the power vacuum caused by Hecate being removed from power, Gruagach had the witches allow him to revive Nimue to be their new leader. But Nimue exacts her revenge on the witches who imprisoned her and abandoned Grugach as she prepares to wage war on the world. However, Nimue would later learn that she became a vessel for the Ogdru Jahad in their attempt to prematurely enter the world through her. When possessing Nimue, the Ogdru Jahad could speak English. During its fight with Hellboy, the Ogdru Jahad seemed very arrogant and considered the world its birthright. It was also very malicious and sadistic, as it purposefully unleashed a storm that killed thousands and taunted Hellboy about his inability to stop it. In this from, the Ogdru Jahad referred to itself as one being. Hellboy eventually managed to kill it using Excalibur. However, he was killed by Nimue's ghost and dragged to Hell.\n\nAs the Ogdru Jahad advance their plans on Earth, it becomes evident that they intend to transform humanity into a new \"final\" race of man. The attempts are seen in the frog monsters that were first seen in \"Seed of Destruction\" and then again in \"Conqueror Worm\" and \",\" creatures strong enough to overpower Hellboy and can assume human form. Moreover, the frogmen can exert a degree of telepathic influence over their victims, confusing them with illusions and mind-tricks. These creatures also possess souls, that create a corrupting influence on living beings. If they pass on, a creature seems to devour their ectasic spirits. Whether this being is the Ogdru Jahad or something else entirely is uncertain.\n\nThe frogmen are linked to the Ogdru Jahad, and are being employed to free the Ogdru Hem who were imprisoned by the Watchers at the beginning of time. Once the Ogdru Hem are free, the Ogdru Jahad will follow. Currently, due to the events in \"A Plague of Frogs,\" numerous frogmen have escaped the clutches of the B.P.R.D. and are moving across the North American countryside. These nests seem constructed around the purpose of praying to the Ogdru Hem and, in certain locations, obtain relics and items which spawn vicious and lethal Ogdru-Hem-like creatures. Moreover, the frogs have transcended their human limitations and have developed the ability to convert their bodies to biological factories, producing thousands of tadpoles which become frog monsters.\n\nAfter the events of \"\", it appeared that the frog monsters have been dealt a major setback but, as seen in \"B.P.R.D.: The Warning\" and \"B.P.R.D.: The Black Goddess\", the creatures regrouped and allied themselves with the subterraineans from \"\". In \"\", it is revealed that the frog monsters were flawed attempts to create the next race of men with Abe Sapien also learning that he is actually a perfected version of the creatures.\n\nIn the 2004 film \"Hellboy\", the Ogdru Jahad were mentioned by name only twice by Rasputin. They were portrayed as indistinct, octopus-like creatures encased in crystal shells. They are referred to by him as the seven gods of chaos who will destroy the world and from its ashes \"a new Eden will arise\". At the conclusion of the film, their prisons were shattered and the Ogdru Jahad began their assault on Earth. Before the final lock could be released by Hellboy, he regained his senses and the Ogdru Jahad disappeared.\n\nSammael, a demon in the film, was referred to as the \"son of Nergal\"; hinting the monster to be one of the Ogdru Hem through Nergal-Jahad. The giant Behemoth, the \"god\" Rasputin answers to and appears at the end of the film resembles the Ogdru Hem known as Sadu-Hem.\n\nIn \"\", the Ogdru Jahad (or possibly Ogdru Hem) made a cameo as the brothers of Thunder and Lightning. Though not mentioned by name, they were referred to as the \"Dragons\".\n\n"}

It is connected to Rattanakosin Island by Ratchadamnoen Avenue (literally, 'royal way for travelling').\n\nNeighbouring districts are, clockwise from north, Bang Sue, Phaya Thai, Ratchathewi, Pathum Wan, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Phra Nakhon, and across the Chao Phraya River, Bang Phlat District.\n\nThe district was established by King Chulalongkorn, who wanted to escape the confines of Rattanakosin Island. The king began with the construction of a new palace compound called the Dusit Palace in 1890s, slowly adding many new residences and mansions into its grounds. This included the Vimanmek Mansion which was constructed in 1900 completely out of teak, and was used as a royal palace for a short time, but was abandoned in 1908. Reconstructed in 1992, it was a major tourist attraction until its closure in 2018. The Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall was completed in 1906, and became the main residential palace of the king. The pathway connecting the Grand Palace to Dusit Palace eventually became Ratchadamnoen Avenue. \n\nThe construction of both Dusit Palace and Ratchadamnoen Avenue allowed and encouraged the expansion of Bangkok outside its city walls and the traditional confines of the Rattanakosin area. The palace expanded Bangkok northwards, while the avenue accommodated further growth. The avenue extended from the palace, starting in front of the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall and the Royal Plaza southwards along the Makawan Rangsant and Phanfah Lielas Bridges then westward across the Phanbipob Liela Bridge, then south again long the Sanam Luang to the Grand Palace. \n\nThe Chitralada Royal Villa was built by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI), and was a residence of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The large park around the palace was used by the king for agricultural research.\n\nImportant buildings in the district include Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, which was another former residence of King Chulalongkorn, and was later used as the first parliament building. It was built 1907–1915 by the Italian architects, Annibale Rigotti and Mario Tamagno. Next to the throne hall is the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, the official residence of the current monarch King Vajiralongkorn.\n\nNext to the building is Suan Amporn Park, and across the street Dusit Zoo, the first zoo in Thailand (moved to Pathum Thani since the end of September 2018). The vast space in front of Ananta Samakom Throne Hall is the Royal Plaza. At the middle of the plaza is the equestrian statue of King Chulalongkorn. Various events are held in Suan Amporn Park and Royal Plaza. Yearly events include commencements of many universities in Bangkok, and the Red Cross Fair which takes place for nine days from the end of March to the first week of April.\n\nImportant government buildings such as the Government House and Phitsanulok Mansion are also in Dusit. Wasukri Pier is the pier to board and store royal barges, which sail in Thailand's Royal Barge Procession. Near the pier is the National Library of Thailand. In addition, it is also home to several military camps: 1st Cavalry Regiment, King's Guard; 4th Cavalry Division, King's Guard; 1st Field Artillery Battalion, King's Guard; Air Defense Artillery Division; Department of Army Transportation; Army Ordnance Department; Army Ordnance Learning Center; Command And General Staff College; and some parts of Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) such as the Directorate of Aeronautical Engineering. Dusit has been known as the \"Military Zone\".\n\nSince 1932 the National Assembly has been situation somewhere within the district. From 1932 to 1974 the legislature met at the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. From 1974 the legislature moved to a purposefully built Parliament House (next to the Dusit Palace complex) and met there until 2018. Then it was moved again to a new building named the Sappaya-Sapasathan in the Kiakkai neighbourhood in the north of the district.\n\nSeveral other palaces have been converted into facilities for other purposes. Chan Kasem Palace was initially built for the crown prince by King Rama V, but was never used by King Rama VI and later became the office of the Ministry of Education. Suan Sunandha Palace was built for the queen, consorts, princes and princesses, but is now home to Suan Sunandha Rajabhat University.\n\nThe most famous Buddhist temple of the district is Wat Benchamabophit, built by Prince Naris as the royal temple of King Chulalongkorn.\n\nThe Bang Sue MRT Station of the MRT is a short distance outside Dusit District at its extreme northeast corner in Bang Sue District.\n\nThe Yommarat Railway Halt of the SRT is on the border of Dusit and Ratchathewi Districts.\n\nDusit District Chao Phraya Express Boat piers are Thewes Pier, Payap Pier, and Kiakkai Pier.\n\nThe district is divided into five sub-districts (\"khwaeng\"):\n"}

He only appeared in one game, a 15–5 loss to the Boston Red Sox while pitching for the Cleveland Indians on September 21, 1922. Hamann co-holds a dubious record which can never be broken; since Hamann faced seven hitters and did not record a single out, he retired with a lifetime Earned Run Average of infinity.\n\nHamann was one of a group of players that Indians player-manager Tris Speaker sent in partway through the game on September 21, 1922, done as an opportunity for fans to see various minor league prospects. Also playing his only ML game that day was first baseman Uke Clanton. For shortstop Chick Sorrells, third baseman Ike Kahdot and left fielder Joe Rabbitt, all of whom had made between 1–3 appearances earlier in the month, this would also mark the final major league game of their careers.\n\nHamann entered the game in the ninth inning, taking over from Logan Drake, who was also making his major league debut. (Drake would pitch 10 games in the majors, through 1924.) With the Indians already trailing 9–5, Hamann walked Johnny Mitchell and Ed Chaplin, then hit opposing pitcher Jack Quinn. He followed that up with a walk to Mike Menosky, forcing in a run. Elmer Miller then tripled to clear the bases, and George Burns singled Miller home. Only after Del Pratt followed with another single did manager Tris Speaker pull Hamann, who also threw a wild pitch in what was his only major league appearance. Burns also eventually came around to score, for the sixth and final run charged to Hamann. In addition to his infinite ERA, Hamann holds the record for most batters faced in a career without recording an out.\n\nHis appearance with the Indians was apparently his only one in a pro baseball game; there is no record of Hamann ever playing in the minor leagues. Before pitching for the Indians, Hamann played semi-pro baseball in New Ulm, Minnesota. He died more than a half-century later, in 1973.\n"}

{"id": "2142912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142912", "title": "Tirumala Nayaka", "text": "Tirumala Nayaka\n\nTirumala Nayaka or Thirumalai Nayak ruled Madurai between A.D 1623 and 1659. He was the most notable of the thirteen Madurai Nayak rulers in the 17th century. His contributions are found in the many splendid buildings and temples of Madurai. His kingdom was under constant threat from the armies of Bijapur Sultanate and the other neighbouring Muslim kingdoms, which he managed to repulse successfully. His territories comprised much of the old Pandya territories which included Coimbatore, Tirunelveli, Madurai districts, Aragalur in southern Tamil Nadu and some territories of the Travancore kingdom.\n\nTirumala Nayaka was a great patron of art and architecture and the Dravidian architecture evolved into the \"Madurai style\". He rebuilt and renovated a number of old temples of the Pandya period. His palace, known as the Tirumala Nayaka Palace, is a notable architectural masterpiece.\nTirumala Nayaka succeeded his brother Muttu Virappa Nayak on the Madurai there in A.D 1623. The political situation in south Tamil Nadu was confused with the decline of the Vijayanagar empire, and the once feudatory Nayak governors of Madurai, Thanjavur, Gingee and Mysore were quarrelling to divide the dissolving Vijayanagara Empire. The Muslim kingdoms in the Deccan began to press southwards. Immediately after becoming king, Tirumala Nayaka withheld the payment of tributes to the Vijayanargara kings. He also gathered a large army in Thiruchirapalli and strengthened its fortifications.\n\nAround 1638, the Vijayanagara King Ranga, succeeded to the throne of Chandragiri and he soon resolved to put an end to the independence of Tirumala Nayaka by preparing to march southwards. Tirumala Nayaka had meanwhile persuaded the Vijayanagar governors of Tanjore and Gingee (in south Arcot) to join him in his defiance of their mutual suzerain, and thus Ranga was left with only Mysore, of all his feudatories, to support him. The Nayak governor of Thanjavur eventually left his allies, sent in his submission, and betrayed the other Nayaks.\n\nRanga advanced upon Gingee Fort and laid siege to it. Tirumala Nayaka requested the Bijapur Sultan to send assistance. However the Bijapur troops defeated the Vijayanaraga army and turned on the Nayak armies by attacking the Gingee fort themselves. Gingee soon fell to the Bijapur troops. Tirumala Nayaka retreated in dismay to Madurai, and the Bijapur army advanced southwards, defeated the Thanjavur Nayak, and proceeded to lay waste the Madurai country. Tirumala Nayaka then submitted, apparently without striking a blow, paid a large ransom to the invaders, and agreed to send an annual tribute to the Sultan of Bijapur.\n\nThe Vijayanagar ruler had taken refuge with the king of Mysore, and then, these two monarchs combined to endeavor to recover those portions of the Vijayanagara territories, which had recently been captured by Golconda. Tirumala Nayaka, making use of the opportunity to settle a long-standing quarrel with the kingdom of Mysore, persuaded the Sultans of Golconda and Bijapur to help him attack Mysore from the south. The Sultan of Golconda accepted and attacked Mysore and extinguished the Vijayanagara Empire and humbled the kingdom of Mysore. In return Tirumala Nayaka paid large amounts as tribute to the Golconda Sultan.\n\nTirumala Nayaka had another conflict with Mysore towards the end of his reign. The battles began with the invasion of Coimbatore by the Mysore king apparently in revenge for Tirumala Nayaka’s contribution to his defeat at the hands of the Golconda Sultanate. Coimbatore was occupied by the Mysore armies with ease, and Madurai itself was threatened. The Mysore troops were however repulsed from the town by the assistance of the Setupati of Ramnad. This campaign was known as the ‘hunt for noses’ because under the orders of the Mysore king, the invaders cut off the noses of all their prisoners and sent them in sacks to Seringapatam as trophies.\n\nA counter invasion of Mysore was undertaken shortly afterwards by Tirumala Nayaka under the command of Kumara Muttu Nayak, his younger brother, and was a success, in which the king of Mysore himself was captured and his nose was cut off and sent to Madurai.{\n\nDuring Tirumala Nayaka's reign, two rebellions occurred amongst his feudatories. The first was by the Setupati of Ramnad. It was due to an order of Tirumala Nayaka in 1635 regarding the succession to the chief of that territory, which was resisted by the rightful claimant. Tirumala Nayaka was successful in placing his nominee on the throne and in imprisoning the rival aspirant, but he was ultimately compelled to allow the latter to succeed. His heir reciprocated this action by supporting Tirumala Nayaka in his final war with Mysore.\n\nThe other rebellion was caused by a confederacy of Poligars headed by the powerful chief of Ettaiyapuram in the Tirunelveli district. The reason for this upraising is not clear. The Setupati of Ramnad, as chief of all the Poligars, quelled it. The leader of the rebels was put to death and the others punished.\n\nTirumala Nayaka’s capital was Madurai. The royal residence had been moved from there to Thiruchirapalli by his predecessor, but Tirumala Nayaka moved it back to Madurai again. The reason for this move is claimed to be due to a dream Tirumala Nayaka had but also stated by historians that Madurai has a long history and continuously civilized through ages and thiruchirapalli is at a threat of immediate attack by mysore.\n\nTirumala Nayaka is best remembered for the many splendid public buildings he built in Madurai. Despite so many upheavals, Tirumala Nayaka's reign is famous for the legacy he left behind in numerous constructions. He added a tower to the Meenakshi temple, the unfinished tower called the Raja Gopuram and added a hall. He is credited for excavating the huge artificial pond, or \"Teppakulam\".\nHe also built the beautiful palace called Tirumala Nayaka's palace. The palace was divided into two major parts, namely \"Swargavilasa\" and \"Rangavilasa\". The royal residence, theatre, shrine, apartments, armoury, palanquin place, royal bandstand, quarters, pond and garden were situated in these two portions. The courtyard and the dancing hall are the major centres of attraction of the palace.\n\nHe is also credited with building the Perumal temple at Tallakulam, Madurai.\n\nTirumala Nayaka took great personal interest in the erection of the \"Pudumandapa\" at the Madurai temple. There are some account which recount that on one occasion, Sumandramurti Achari, the principal architect, was so deeply engrossed in sculpting a relief of the stone elephant eating sugarcane, an incident in the temple's puranic history, that he did not notice the Nayak standing by him. The Nayak rolled some betel leaves and areca nuts and handed them to him. Thinking that it was an assistant who had done so, he took them and began to chew them without looking around. When he realised that it was the Nayak himself, he was so much affected that he damaged the two fingers of his that had taken the betel leaves. Moved by his devotion to duty, the Nayak gave him many gifts. \n\nOn another occasion a son of an artist pestered him for a mango when that fruit was not in season. He would not take no for an answer. The Nayak ordered that gold mangoes be brought from the palace. The boy was content and allowed his father to continue the work undisturbed. From this incident the family came to be called the \"Mampazham\" family. \n\nWhen, on yet another occasion, an artist was making a sculpture of a consort of the Nayak's and a chip broke off from the thigh. By curious coincidence, the queen actually had a scar in the same place as the chip. The artist started work on another image, but a chip again appeared at the same place. A minister of the Nayak advised the artist to finish the statue with the chip. When the Nayak saw the image, he was angry, wondering how the minister knew that his queen had a scar on her thigh. He sent for him. The minister knew that the Nayak was angry and might punish him. So he put out his eyes. At this the Nayak was filled with remorse. Thereupon the minister composed a poem in the praise of the Goddess, beseeching her to give him back his eyesight if he was innocent. She restored it. The minister was a famous Sanskrit poet, named Neelakanta Dikshitar. Among his works are the \"Shivalilarnava\", on the traditions of Lord Shiva in Madurai, and the \"Gangavatarana\", on the descent of the Ganga to the earth. After this incident the minister took leave of the King and was endowed with a village called Palamadai (Neelakanta Samudram) East of present-day Sankarnagar, in Tirunelveli. Sri. Nilakanta Diksihthar was the grand nephew of Appayya Dikshita and this family clan has a rich tradition of intellectuals.\n\nTirumala Nayaka ate his breakfast only after the pujas were performed at Srivilliputhur Andal Temple To get the information that the pujas were completed, the king built mandaps about every five kilometres on the route from Madurai to Srivilliputhur and installed loud bells in them. Each mandap also had a small kitchen.when there was a message to be sent a series of bells rang.\n\nAnother anecdote tells us that Tirumala Nayaka first brought his queen to the Tirumala Nayaka palace after it was completed. She commented that the giant pillars and arches reminded her of a stable for elephants, sending the king into such a rage that he had her confined for the rest of her life. And he took another wife.\n\nBaltsar Da Costa, a jesuit traveller chronicles in 1646 ‘Relacao Annual’ describing Thirumala Nayaka in more graphic still\n\n\"“Almost every day he appears on the terrace surrounded by his courtiers, while in front of them his elephants are drawn up in two rows, the space between them being occupied by three or four hundred Turks (Turcos) who form his bodyguard. When he comes out of the fortress to visit some pagodes (Temple), as he is wonts to do on days of festivals, he is surrounded with great pomp. Sometimes he rides in a palanquin, at other times he mounts an enormous elephant…Next come the elephants in a long file, mounted by his nobles and chief captains, preceded by the arms and insignia(crest) of the Nāyaka.Then the cavalry and the rest of the troops follow\".\"\n\nTirumala Nayaka died in 1659. He was between sixty-five and seventy years of age at the time and had reigned for thirty-six years. His territories at his death comprised the present districts of Madurai (including the territories of Ramnad and Sivaganga), Thirunelveli, Coimbatore, Salem and Thiruchirapalli, with Pudukkotai and parts of Travancore annexed to it.\n\n\n"}

Corresponding models of baryons are referred to as quark–diquark models. The diquark is often treated as a single subatomic particle with which the third quark interacts via the strong interaction. The existence of diquarks inside the nucleons is a disputed issue, but it helps to explain some nucleon properties and to reproduce experimental data sensitive to the nucleon structure. Diquark–antidiquark pairs have also been advanced for anomalous particles such as the X(3872).\n\nThe forces between the two quarks in a diquark is attractive when both the colors and spins are antisymmetric. When both quarks are correlated in this way they tend to form a very low energy configuration. This low energy configuration has become known as a diquark.\n\nMany scientists theorize that a diquark should not be considered a particle. Even though they may contain two quarks they are not colour neutral, and therefore cannot exist as isolated bound states. So instead they tend to float freely inside hadrons as composite entities; while free-floating they have a size of about . This also happens to be the same size as the hadron itself.\n\nDiquarks are the conceptual building blocks, and as such give scientists an ordering principle for the most important states in the hadronic spectrum. There are many different pieces of evidence that prove diquarks are fundamental in the structure of hadrons. One of the most compelling pieces of evidence comes from a recent study of baryons. In this study the baryon had one heavy and two light quarks. Since the heavy quark is inert, the scientists were able to discern the properties of the different quark configurations in the hadronic spectrum.\n\nAn experiment was conducted using diquarks in an attempt to study the Λ and Σ baryons that are produced in the creation of hadrons created by fast-moving quarks. In the experiment the quarks ionized the vacuum area. This produced the quark–antiquark pairs, which then converted themselves into mesons. When generating a baryon by assembling quarks, it is helpful if the quarks first form a stable two-quark state. The Λ and the Σ are created as a result of up, down and strange quarks. Scientists found that the Λ contains the [ud] diquark, however the Σ does not. From this experiment scientists inferred that Λ baryons are more common than Σ baryons, and indeed they are more common by a factor of 10.\n\n"}

It has two public houses, a church, and a school. According to the 2011 UK Census, Worth had a population of 992.\n\nWorth was supposedly first inhabited due to its fertile soils. This then eventually led to the cultivation of the land during the Norman times by the Lords of the Eastry Manor.\n\nAccording to Hasted in the 18th century, Worth was made up of three boroughs, only one of which making up the current village of the 21st century, Worth Street. In the Gazetteer of the British Isles in 1887, John Bartholomew described Worth as coastal parish and village. During the sixteenth century, the area was known for its redbrick style of housing, however the parish church of St Peter & St Paul's, depicted on the left, shows the signs of Norman work from the twelfth century.\n\nThe parish name of Worth is said to relate to the word Enclosure, and incorporates a description of \"elements and their meanings\".\n\nC.S. Forester's fictional naval hero Horatio Hornblower was born in the village of Worth, according to Hornblower's biographer Cyril Northcote Parkinson in The Life and Times of Horatio Hornblower. According to Parkinson, the name of the small village varied in the 18th century from Word or Worde to Worth and that a farm called the Blue Pigeons was central to the smuggling business at that time. There is today a Blue Pigeon Inn in Worth.\n\nIt is said by a local legend that Henry V was returning on 25 October, also known as St Crispin's Day, where he had claimed victory at Agincourt, disembarking at Worth. Here he fell in love with a local \"ale-wife\", where they ended up living together at the local inn. supposedly as to why the Crispin Inn (pictured) of Worth is named as it is.\n\nThe two maps below depict the same mapped view of Worth, simply one century apart. As is clear by them, mapping technique and quality vastly improved over this period. Photography made mapping a lot more simple and a lot more accurate for Ordnance Survey.\n\nThe village of Worth covers an area of 1629 hectares and with the population of 992, it has a population density of 0.61 people per hectare. In 1801, the village of Worth only had a population of 264 people, which rose to 718 come 1961. Population figures peaked to 977 as shown in the 1931 UK Census, however due to the unforeseeable circumstances of World War II, population plummeted and only in the most recent census has the population climbed above the 977 mark.\n\nAs shown in the graphs to the right, female and male employment in history has been very different. In 2011 in Worth there were 414 people ages 16–74 in formal employment, with the majority of these being in wholesale and retail trade; and repair of motor vehicles (58), closely followed by those working in education (51). In 2011 Worth had 431 people listed as economically active, which left a total of 272 economically inactive. Despite this only 18 are listed as 'unemployed', as the majority of those who are economically inactive are either retired, students, on long term sick leave, disabled or are carers for other family members.\n\nWithin Worth there are 403 households, the majority of these have either 1 or 2 occupants, 106 and 183 respectively.\n\nIn 2011, out of the population of Worth, the most common religion is that of Christianity, with 651 Christians, compared to the next highest belief, being no religious views, encompassing 225 people. This is a trend for both which follows the trends of the whole district of Dover. Health in the area is high, with only 82 people out of 992 being in bad or very bad health in the 2011 UK Census. Of the 992 people living in Worth, according to the 2011 Census, 950 of these were born in the United Kingdom.\n"}

{"id": "2142986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2142986", "title": "County corporate", "text": "County corporate\n\nA county corporate or corporate county was a type of subnational division used for local government in England, Wales, and Ireland.\n\nCounties corporate were created during the Middle Ages, and were effectively small self-governing county-empowered entities such as towns or cities which were deemed to be important enough to be independent from their counties. A county corporate could also be known as a \"county of itself\", similar to an independent city or consolidated city-county in other countries.\n\nWhile they were administratively distinct counties, with their own sheriffs and lord lieutenancies, most of the counties corporate remained part of the \"county at large\" for purposes such as the county assize courts. From the 17th century, the separate jurisdictions of the counties corporate were increasingly merged with that of the surrounding county, so that by the late 19th century the title was mostly a ceremonial one.\n\nBy the 14th century, the growth of some towns had led to strong opposition to their government by local counties. While charters giving various rights were awarded to each borough, some were awarded complete effective independence including their own sheriffs, quarter sessions and other officials, and were sometimes given governing rights over a swathe of surrounding countryside. They were referred to in the form \"Town and County of ...\" or \"City and County of ...\", and so became known as the counties corporate. Other counties corporate were created to deal with specific local problems, such as border conflict (in the case of Berwick-upon-Tweed) and piracy (in the cases of Poole and Haverfordwest).\n\nIn the late 19th century the status of counties corporate changed. By the Militia Act 1882 the lieutenancies of the cities and towns were combined with those of adjacent counties, with two exceptions: the City of London, which retained its separate status, and Haverfordwest, which had a separate lieutenancy until 1974. Then the Local Government Act 1888 created the new status of county borough in England and Wales, with administrative functions similar to counties corporate. Some smaller counties corporate (Berwick upon Tweed, Lichfield, Lincoln, Poole, Carmarthen and Haverfordwest) became part of the administrative county in which they were situated. The City of London retained its previous status. Other counties corporate became county boroughs.\n\nIn England and Wales counties corporate were not formally abolished until 1974, although the only vestiges of their existence were the right of the city or borough corporation to appoint a ceremonial sheriff; and the fact that the letters patent appointing lord lieutenants still included the names of the town or city. For example, the Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire's full title was \"Lieutenant of and in the County of Gloucester, and the City and County of Gloucester, and the City and County of Bristol\".\n\nIn Ireland, eight counties corporate were extant by 1610. Each contained rural \"liberties\" outside the municipal boundary; these were transferred to the adjacent county-at-large in 1840–2, except in the case of Carrickfergus. The extant baronies of Cork and Dublin are approximately coterminous with the territories transferred from the respective cities in 1840. The 1842 report of the Select Committee on Grand Jury Presentments of Ireland found none of the counties corporate except Drogheda derived any advantage from their status, and recommended they be absorbed as baronies of the adjoining county-at-large. The counties corporate were explicitly abolished in 1899 under the terms of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford became county boroughs. Carrickfergus, Drogheda, Galway and Kilkenny became parts of administrative counties. The barony of Carrickfergus is coterminous with the former county of the town.\n\nThe counties corporate (listed with date of creation where known) were:\n\n\n† The City of London retains its separate shrievalty and lieutenancy; the City of Bristol regained its separate shrievalty and lieutenancy in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1016 there was a bloody revolt in Ifriqiya in which the Fatimid residence Al-Mansuriya was completely destroyed and 20,000 Shiites were massacred. The unrest forced a ceasefire in the conflict with the Hammadids of Algeria, and their independence was finally recognized in 1018.\n\nAl-Muizz took over the government in 1022 following the overthrow of his aunt. The relationship with the Fatimids was strained, when in 1027 they supported a revolt of the Zanatas in Tripolitania which resulted in permanent loss of control of the region. His son Abdallah shortly ruled Sicily in 1038-1040, after intervening with a Zirid army in the civil war that broke out in the island.\n\nThe political turmoil notwithstanding, the general economic wellbeing initially made possible an extensive building programme. However, the kingdom found itself in economic crisis in the 1040s, reflected in currency devaluation, epidemic and famine. This may have been related to the high level of tribute which the Zirids were compelled to pay annually to the Fatimids (one million gold dinars a year).\n\nWhen al-Muizz (under the influence of Sunni jurists in Kairouan, growing Sunni public pressure in his realm and a violent backlash against the Shi'ite minority) recognised the Abbasids in Baghdad as rightful Caliphs in 1045 and adopted Sunni orthodoxy, the break with the Fatimids was complete. He even denounced the Fatimids and their followers as heretics in newly minted coinage.\n\nThe Fatimids then sent a military campaign composed of Bedouin tribes of the Banu Hilal and the Banu Sulaym from Egypt to Ifriqiya. The invasion of the Bedouin (1051–1052) led to great hardship after the defeat at Jabal Haydaran, severely impacting agriculture in Ifriqiya. The Fatimids dispatched Makin al-Dawla to rally the Bedouin invaders and duly besiege al-Muizz in Kairouan and conquer Gabes and much of Ifriqiya’s hinterlands in 1053–1054. The conquest of Kairouan in 1057 resulted in further anarchy. The Zirids lost control over the hinterland and were only able to retain the coastal areas, the capital being moved to Mahdia. With the growth of Bedouin Emirates and the continuing insecurity inland, the economy of Ifriqiya looked increasingly towards the Mediterranean, with the result the coastal cities grew in importance through maritime trade and piracy.\n\nAl-Muizz was succeeded by his son Tamim ibn Muizz.\n\nHe is usually thought to be the author of the famous \"Kitab `umdat al-kuttab wa `uddat dhawi al-albab\" (Staff of the Scribes). It is divided in twelve chapters, writes amongst others on the excellence of the pen, he wrote on the preparation of types of inks, the preparation of colored inks, metallic inks (including ones prepared from silver filings and alcohol), the coloring of dyes and mixtures, secret writing, the making of paper and the Arabic gum and glue.\n"}

Its statutory purpose is to provide data on the population's opinion regarding political and social issues. Major Polish newspapers and news magazines, such as Gazeta Wyborcza, Rzeczpospolita, and Polityka, regularly commission CBOS to conduct polls. Apart from its public function, CBOS also conducts commercial market research to help finance its operations.\n\nCBOS conducts a monthly survey on a representative sample of 1,000 adult persons entitled \"Current Problems and Events\" (\"Aktualne problemy i wydarzenia\"). The findings are published on a monthly basis and made available on the internet with a one-month delay (since 1998). Each monthly report focuses on a specific topic, with certain topics recurring in regular intervals. An abridged English-language newsletter, entitled \"Polish Public Opinion\" and containing summaries of results on various topics, is also available online and free of charge.

Agnieszka Kublik writing for \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" noted that the poll was a failure not only because of how respondents were being approached by CBOS, but also because of its perceived political affiliations.\n\nAfter the parliamentary election 2019, Europe Elects showed that CBOS had the largest accumulative error among all Polish pollsters, favouring especially the government party PiS.\n"}

{"id": "2143063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143063", "title": "Mangere Bridge (bridges)", "text": "Mangere Bridge (bridges)\n\nMangere Bridge, officially also called the Manukau Harbour Crossing, is a dual motorway bridge over the Manukau Harbour in south-western Auckland, New Zealand, crossing between the suburb also known as Mangere Bridge (southern side) and the suburb of Onehunga (northern side).\n\nThe older portion of the bridge, completed in 1983, carries a four-lane motorway with a cycle and pedestrian path suspended under the western side. By 2000, this bridge was carrying 80,000 vehicles daily and had become prone to congestion.\n\nIn 2010, a duplication of the 1983 bridge was opened on its eastern side. This doubled the number of general traffic lanes to eight and provided an additional two for buses, for a total capacity of 10 lanes across the harbour. The project had been delayed by disagreements over design and funding, and over the scope of the bridge project and an associated interchange – with the interchange being scaled down after concerns from the local community.\n\n\nThe initial bridge in this location was built of timber and designed by the Reverend Dr Arthur Guyon Purchas and was opened in January 1875. Rather narrow, it also soon began to be attacked by shipworms, and in 1910, more than 30 of the piles had been replaced, as well as the decking. The bridge was also single-lane, and so narrow, even pedestrians could barely pass a vehicle safely. The bridge was eventually considered structurally unsound and closed in 1914, before being fully demolished.\n\n\nIn January 1914 (1915 in some sources), a long replacement bridge was opened. Designed by R.F. Moore, the designer of Grafton Bridge, it was also built by the same company, the Ferro-Concrete Company of Australasia (in a time when almost all bridges in the country were being built by the Public Works Department). This ferro-concrete bridge with driven concrete piles was considered a substantial engineering achievement in its time. With a width of 11.6m, it allowed for a double tram track. The bridge however did not provide for enough clearance to let anything but small boats pass under it. In World War II, an anti-tank road block was erected on the bridge near the middle of the spans, with a small sentry shelter close by. These structures were later removed, and it is unclear whether the bridge had also been mined.\n\nHowever, the bridge soon proved to have too little capacity, and sinking foundation piles created issues. The bridge was closed in 1983 to motor vehicles and is slowly deteriorating, especially after it sustained damage when a ship accidentally rammed it some years ago. A second ship, the 300 ft container transport \"Spirit of Resolution\", also crashed into the bridge on 8 October 2005 as it attempted to leave a nearby Port of Onehunga berth during winds estimated later as being between 30–40 knots (with stronger gusts) and against a strong incoming tide. The collision occurred despite the ship's bow thrusters working at full power and a small harbour tug assisting.\n\nDue to problems with the quality of the concrete and steel, it was initially envisioned that the bridge would be dismantled and replaced by a newly designed footbridge. Due to complaints about this course of action, plans for its removal were not finalised until 2012. Construction of a replacement structure, designed for walking, cycling and fishing, was scheduled for 2015, the centenary of the opening of the old bridge.\nOn 25 November 2018 the bridge was permanently closed by the New Zealand Transport agency due to safety concerns about its deterioration. The walk and cycle-way under the motorway bridge was repainted and had new lights installed as an alternative route for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the harbour. Council workers were in place to ensure the safety of people using the underpass.\n\nOld Mangere Bridge Replacement Plans\n\nThe New Zealand Transport agency is planning to begin construction on a bridge to replace the Old Mangere Bridge in 2019. The new bridge will be built on the same abutments as the previous bridge however it will be built further from the port and allow enough clearance for small boats to pass underneath. The planned bridge will be at least eight metres wide and up to 12 metres wide in some bays to enable fishing activities.\n\n\nThe older portion of the current Mangere Bridge was opened in 1983, and now carries approximately 80,000 vehicles a day. This motorway bridge took 8 years to build, including a 2½-year stoppage due to industrial action and other delays.\n\nA duplication of the 1983 structure, to increase capacity, was completed in 2010 at a cost of $230 million. It is 650 metres long and provides four southbound lanes (the same number as the 1983 bridge, which was made northbound only), and two (shoulder) bus lanes. One of the lanes is dedicated to local connectivity between Onehunga and the Mangere Bridge suburb only. The total capacity across the harbour is 10 lanes.\n\n\nOn 17 May 2006, Finance Minister Michael Cullen announced in the Budget that funds were being allocated to Land Transport New Zealand, to help the National Land Transport Programme accelerate certain projects. That included funds for duplication of the 1983 bridge, to its east. The programme indicated that only $2.78 million funding was then approved for investigation of the project, though Transit New Zealand might apply for additional $1.5 million for further investigation of the project. The bridge was at that time expected to cost NZ$330 million.\n\n\nAs a wider part of the Manukau Harbour Crossing Project, the motorway was also to be widened between Walmsley Road in the south and Queenstown Road in the north from four lanes to six lanes. This widening was to predominantly take place to the east of the existing motorway. The Onehunga interchange (known as the Gloucester Park Interchange) was to be significantly reworked, to provide a more logical link with the motorway, and to ease congestion along Onehunga Harbour Drive. A standard diamond interchange was initially chosen by Transit, but after consultation with Auckland City Council this was then reworked into a quarter-diamond design, with the northbound onramp hooking underneath a proposed Neilson Road bridge.\n\nAs part of that investigation, Transit considered whether it would have been worthwhile to toll new capacity to assist in funding its construction. This could have been in the form of tolling the new lanes along this route, which would have ensured an untolled alternative was available (as legally required), while the tolled new lanes would be far less congested. In mid 2007, Transit indicated that it would not seek a decision on funding the bridge via road tolls before starting work on construction. Auckland Airport had accused Transit of threatening to defer the project if it could not gain backing from the public and local Councils. As the bridge was to be finished for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, further delays would possibly have resulted in the bridge not being completed in time.\n\n\nIn early 2007 Transit indicated that it would be \"more than willing\" to develop the duplicate bridge so that it could accommodate a possible future rail link between Auckland City and Auckland Airport, which would be completed by extending the defunct Onehunga Branch line (which was in the funding stages of being reopened for passenger traffic and was in fact reopened on 18 September 2010). The railway currently terminates near the northern end of the bridge. A combination solution was debated which would see a rail link use the same bridge foundations. The change came after repeated lobbying by the Auckland Regional Council, which was of the opinion that Transit's initial proposal to simply reserve space alongside the duplicate bridge for a later, but separate, rail bridge was not acceptable.\n\nIn September 2007, Auckland Regional Transport Authority proposed to pledge NZ$2.5 million for future-proofing works to ensure that a rail link would be included. The design envisaged the future railway line run on the new bridge piers for part of the distance underneath the motorway structure, thus saving some of the high costs associated with strengthening the bridge to be able to take a cantilevered bridge – estimated at around NZ$20 million in extra costs.\n\n\nIn July 2007, Auckland City Council commissioners gave approval to widening the approach motorway for the bridge through Onehunga Bay, but opposed the new interchange design north of the bridge favoured by Transit, which intended to construct it around 7 m high over Gloucester Park and the Hopua volcanic tuff ring. The Council's preferred version was to build the interchange at ground level with part of the motorway in a cut and cover tunnel.\n\nThe recommendation, which Transit could have ignored only at the risk of drawn-out legal fights at the Environment Court level (which would probably have delayed the project until after the 2011 Rugby World Cup), was based on the concerns of residents, who feared that the new interchange would increase and cement separation of their suburb from the Manukau Harbour. Partly due to this, Transit New Zealand decided in August 2007 to continue with building the new bridge without including a new interchange for the time being.\n\nTransit New Zealand made provision for a future rail link under both bridges to connect to Auckland Airport, with three of the eight piers constructed strong enough to carry a future rail link.\n\nThe bridge has 7 piers with a total of 14 columns, and consists of approximately 10,000 cubic metres of reinforced concrete (with the rebar weighing approximately 1,000 tons). Some of the piles were driven 50m deep, to avoid issues with the softer top layers in the Manukau Harbour. The bridge itself consists of single-pour concrete columns and form traveller-constructed balanced cantilever decks.\n\nThe related works also included widening of approximately 4 km of associated motorway to ensure the new bridge capacity would be utilised. Existing pedestrian and cyclist links on the old 1914 bridge closed to motor vehicles were retained and are connected to a shared path along the Mangere Bridge waterfront reserve via a new walking/cycling bridge over Onehunga Harbour Road – linking Onehunga to Mangere Bridge suburb and to the Waikaraka Cycleway.\n\nConstruction of the new bridge officially began on 9 April 2008, undertaken by the MHX Alliance, a combination of the NZ Transport Agency, Beca Infrastructure, Fletcher Construction and Higgins Contractors. Completion was followed by a temporary closure of the 1983 bridge for refurbishment works, and the bridge was officially opened on 25 July 2010, seven months ahead of schedule. This brought the number of traffic lanes available over the harbour to 10, 2 of them bus shoulder lanes.\n\nA number of works related to environmental mitigation, post-project landscaping or improvement of non-motorway transport links were associated with the project (and either paid for or undertaken by NZTA). These included a 3.5m wide replacement foot/cycle bridge over Beachcroft Road, a new 3.5m wide foot/cycle bridge over Onehunga Harbour Road at the Old Mangere Bridge, an upgraded underpass under the motorway connecting to Onehunga, as well as improved links to the walking and cycling paths along the harbour and motorway edges and improvement works on the Old Mangere Bridge causeway. After finishing work, NZTA reinstated their large construction staging site along the southern harbour front as an open space, \"passive recreation\" park with Pohutukawa.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2143079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143079", "title": "Vasojevići", "text": "Vasojevići\n\nThe Vasojevići (, ) is a historic Montenegrin Highland tribe and a territorial unit in northeastern Montenegro, in the region of Brda (\"the Highlands\"). It is the largest of the historical tribes, occupying the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and Bihor under Bijelo Polje in the North, Mateševo in the West to Plav in the East. The tribe (\"pleme\") is one of seven Highland tribes (Vasojevići, Moračani, Rovčani, Bratonožići, Kuči, Piperi and Bjelopavlići). Vasojevići is also the name of the region inhabited by the Vasojevići. Most of the tribe's history prior to the 16th century has naturally been passed on through oral history.\n\nAlthough the unofficial center is Andrijevica in north-eastern Montenegro, the tribe stems from Lijeva Rijeka in central Montenegro. The tribe was formed by various tribes that were united under the rule of the central Vasojević tribe. These tribes later migrated to the Komovi mountains and the area of Lim. The emigration continued into what is today Serbia and other parts of Montenegro.\n\nThough sense of tribal affiliation diminished in recent years, is not a thing of a past. Tribal association and organizations still exist (e.g. Udruženje Vasojevića \"Vaso\"). It could be clearly seen during the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum with the Vasojevići united opposition.\n\nIt occupies the area between Vjetarnih Lijeva Rijeka in the South and Bihor under Bijelo Polje in the North, Mateševo in the West to Plav in the East.\n\nThe oldest mention of the Vasojevići dates to 1444, where it is described as not a tribe, but as an ethnic group (a people). The Ragusan Senate report filed by Ragusan merchants dating to October 29, 1444, speaks of the Vasojevići (and their leader Vaso), living near Medun, in Rikavac, having together with the Bjelopavlići and Piperi attacked Ragusan merchants, doing material damage. According to some historians, the fact that the Vasojevići were not mentioned in the 1455 document, points to them having migrated from Upper Zeta. According to the 1485 defter, the Vasojevići and Bratonožići were not yet established tribes.\n\nIn 1658, the seven tribes of Kuči, Vasojevići, Bratonožići, Piperi, Klimenti, Hoti and Gruda allied themselves with the Republic of Venice, establishing the so-called \"Seven-fold banner\" or \"alaj-barjak\", against the Ottomans. In 1689, an uprising broke out in Piperi, Rovca, Bjelopavlići, Bratonožići, Kuči and Vasojevići, while at the same time an uprising broke out in Prizren, Peć, Priština and Skopje, and then in Kratovo and Kriva Palanka in October (Karposh's Rebellion).\n\nDocuments, especially the letter of Ivan Radonjić from 1789, show that the \"Montenegrins\" were identified as Serbs, and that the Banjani, Kuči, Piperi, Bjelopavlići, Zećani, Vasojevići, Bratonožići were not identified as \"Montenegrins\" but only as \"Serb tribes\". They were all mentioned only in a regional, geographical, and tribal manner, and never as an ethnic category.\n\nIn the 18th century the folklore of the tribe was influenced by the Orthodox millenarianism that had developed during the mid Ottoman era. According to one such folk legend, an elder of the Vasojevići, Stanj, foretold Greek priests the advent of a Serbian messiah, a dark man (\"crni čovjek\") who would liberate the Serbs from the Turks. These myths as part of the official Serbian Orthodox doctrine provided both a de facto recognition of Ottoman rule and the denial of its legitimacy.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Vasojevići were divided between the two armies of Serb Chetniks (royalists) and Yugoslav Partisans (communists) that were fighting each other (vojvoda Pavle Đurišić formed the most successful Chetnik units out of mainly Vasojevići). As a result, the conflict spread within the tribal structures.\n\nIn May 2006, Montenegro gained independence after a referendum on the future of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. However, 72% of voters in Andrijevica municipality, the unofficial centre of the Vasojevići region, voted against Montenegrin independence. It was the second highest result against breaking the state union with Serbia (after Pluzine municipality).\n\nThe People's Assembly of Vasojevići stated many times that, apart from being Montenegrin, all Vasojevići are Serb and, thus, strongly oppose and have always opposed Montenegrin secession from Yugoslavia. The Montenegrin census of 2003 revealed that 89,81% of the Vasojevići declared themselves as Serb while 9,43% declared themselves as Montenegrin.\n\nDuring the War in Ukraine, some locals of villages of Andrijevica, part of the Vasojevići tribe, decided to sell and give up land for free to Russia, stating that \"we are brothers\".\n\nIt is a tradition of all brotherhoods to show respect to ancestors by knowing precisely genealogy and the history of the tribe and a family. This also allows members of the clan to be unite, to act together and always to recognise kin.\n\nAccording to a folk myth, the founder of the tribe was \"Vaso\". According to one myth Vaso was a descendant of the medieval Serbian Nemanjić dynasty. Vaso's great-grandfather was Stefan Konstantin, the rival King, who was defeated by his half-brother Stefan Uroš III in 1322. Stefan Konstantin had a son, Stefan Vasoje, who was brought up at the court of Dušan the Mighty. Stefan Vasoje participated in the battles of Dušan, and when he had received sufficient experience, he was put by the Emperor as \"voivode\" at Sjenica. Stefan Vasoje had a son, Stefan Konstantin II (1342–1389, known as \"Vojvoda Vasojević Stevo\" in folklore), who participated in the Battle of Kosovo (1389), where he died. is believed to be either the grandfather or great-grandfather of Vaso. The legend further alleges that Vaso, one of five sons of Stefan Konstantin II (all brothers are founders of clans), moved to Lijeva Rijeka. After the fall of Smederevo fortress (1459) and the subsequent fall of the whole Serbian Empire, Serbs from Kosovo, Metohija and Šumadija fled from the incoming Turks to Bosna and, after its fall (1463), into Herzegovina. Vaso, the founded of the tribe, fled along with these waves of refugees. In 1465 he moved from Herzegovina to Lijeva Rijeka in Zeta (modern day Montenegro).\n\nVaso's descendants gradually expanded to the north-east and inhabited the region by the river Lim called Polimlje – the area around the Komovi mountains, Andrijevica and Berane \n\nPart of the tribe that stayed free from the Turkish occupation lives in the area of Lijeva Rijeka and Andrijevica (Upper Nahija) – they are all called Upper Vasojevići. Lower Vasojevici (or Lower Nahija) inhabited the area of Berane. Most of the Lower Vasojevići were within the Turkish reign until Balkan Wars in the 20th century.\n\nTribe members were perceived as noblemen and rarely mingled with common folk – people who did not have a common ancestor. Vasojevići called them Ašani (earlier also Asa and Hasa) and today this term has come to denote Vasojevići of other origin.\n\nIn a book \"Pleme Vasojevići\" written in 1935, R. Vešović describes the structure of the Vasojevići. The list of families was exhausting when the book was completed but since then new families may have developed. Sometimes, with the very distant genealogy, slight variations of names, chronology and relationships exist concurrently but there is no doubt among the Vasojevići members which family belongs to which brotherhood, branch and sub-branch. Never has any family questioned the structure depicted below. The brotherhoods of Vasojevići stem from different tribes, of no common kinship and ancestry, which were united under the rule of a central tribe that extended its name to the other clans.\n\nAlso connected to the Vasojević tribe are the Vojnović noble family.\n\nAll people of the Vasojevići are descendants of three Vaso sons: Rajo, Novak and Mioman. Hence the three great clans (bratstva) of the Vasojevići:\n\n\nThe local legend has it that Vaso had a fourth son, by the name of Đuro, who left home and settled in Crmnica, where he founded the brotherhood of Đurovići. The legend also recounts how after the Second Battle of Kosovo, defeated Janos Hunyadi (Sibinjanin Janko in Serbian epic poetry) along with his wounded (according to some traditions already dead) nephew Banovac Sekula retreated to the safety of the high Komovi mountains. There he was received by Vaso and his sons, who all gave him a gift respectively: Rajo a sword, Novak a horse, and Mijoman a gun. However, suddenly there was a shout to the arms as the enemy was approaching, and both Novak and Mijo took their gifts back. Rajo, on the other hand, did not want to, so he equipped himself with another weapon. Hynadi blessed him for this, and predicted that he and his brothers will be great heroes, as well as their descendants, but that his own will always be the largest and that they will always be the leaders of the tribe.\n\nRajevići is the biggest branch. It is in turn divided into three branches<br> (again after Raja's sons or grandsons: Đuro, Dabet and Uglješa Damir-Kovač).\n\nFamilies that descend from Lopaćani are:\n\n\nFamilies that are descendants of Dabetići are:\n\n\nFamilies of Kovačevići branch are:\n\nNovakovići is the second biggest branch. <br>Novak had three sons (Nikač, Vuksan/Vuica and Rečko), of which all families hail from:\n\nAll the families of Novakovići brotherhood are as follows:\n\nMiomanovići is the smallest brotherhood of the Vasojevići. The families are:\n\nBy the beginning of the World War II there were more than 3600 Vasojevići “houses” in Polimlje and Lijeva Rijeka. Many notable Serbs (or people with Serbian roots, vide Milla Jovovich) are Vasojevići by origin, e.g.:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He signed for the \"Toffees\" in 1948, but serving his stint of National Service delayed his debut for another three years. During this period he played for the Cheshire Army Cadets team, and it was with them that he was coached by the Everton legend Dixie Dean. It is fairly safe to assume that Dave developed the physical side of his game in this period. Hickson made his debut for Everton in September 1951 against Leeds United, with the Blues in Division Two for only the second season in their history. Hickson was soon a regular fixture in the Everton side.\n\nPerhaps the defining moment in Dave's career came in Everton's 1952–53 FA Cup run. The Blues were still in Division Two, and home wins against Ipswich Town and Nottingham Forest put Everton into the fifth round, where they were drawn with Manchester United. In front of a capacity crowd at Goodison Park, Hickson launched himself headlong in amongst flying boots and emerged with a huge gash above one eyebrow. Hickson was led off down the tunnel, with the crowd fully expecting Everton to play the remainder with 10 men, as substitutes were not yet permitted. He emerged from the tunnel in the second half, greeted by a huge ovation from the crowd, with a row of freshly applied stitches holding the wound together. Minutes later Hickson scored what would end up as the winning goal, then headed against the post and opened the wound again. Despite pleas from both the referee and his captain to leave the field Hickson remained to the end of the game, his blond hair now red, and his shirt the same colour as the United ones. Hickson was also the match-winner in the quarter final against Aston Villa, with a thunderbolt shot from the edge of the box, after starting the move himself behind the halfway line. An epic year for cup ties this, as Everton next faced Bolton Wanderers at Maine Road. Hickson again received a head injury in this game, and was forced to retire with 15 minutes of the game to go. This was not until he'd scored a goal in an improbable comeback from 4-0 down at half time. The final score was 4–3, with Bolton going on to be defeated by the same score against Blackpool in the \"Matthews final\".\n\nEverton soon returned to Division One, as Hickson's haul of 25 goals in the 1953–54 season helped them gain promotion to the top flight. After just one season back in the top flight with Everton, Hickson was sold to Aston Villa for £17,500. He never settled at Villa Park and played just 12 games in a brief stay.\n\nHe moved next to Huddersfield Town, where he spent a further two years. Although his record at Huddersfield was respectable, Hickson was not content and he was happy to return to Goodison for a second spell in 1957 for £7,500. At least the board made a tidy profit on these deals. Hickson's second spell was not as productive as his first, but his passion & determination remained, and the Goodison Park faithful still worshipped him. When Everton sold him to their Merseyside derby rivals Liverpool in 1959, there was much dissent.\n\nHickson was undoubtedly revered at Everton, but equally despised by the red half of the city. Supporters of the \"Reds\", then struggling in Division Two, would soon be appeased. Hickson scored twice on his Liverpool debut at Anfield, watched by a crowd 15,000 higher than the average that season. Days later Liverpool had a new manager, Bill Shankly. He was instantly impressed by Hickson's style and used him effectively. His return of 21 goals in 27 games that season almost took Liverpool back to the top flight. Another near promotion the following year and a return of 16 goals in 33 would see the end of Hickson's stint with Liverpool. Hickson was now nearing 32 and had to make way for Shankly's new signings.\n\nHickson moved on, via non league Cambridge City, to Bury for a short spell, playing just a handful of games. He headed back to Merseyside in the twilight of his career, with a productive last couple of league seasons at Tranmere Rovers. He was Rovers' leading scorer in the 1962/63 season with 23 goals, at the age of 34. Dave continued after this outside the Football League, playing for Ellesmere Port Town and Ballymena United (player/manager for both), and as a player at Winsford and Northwich Victoria.\n\nIt is often said of Hickson that he is the only player to have played \"for all three Merseyside clubs\". This is wrong for several reasons: two other players, John Heydon and Frank Mitchell, also played for all three of Everton, Liverpool and Tranmere Rovers. But New Brighton were Football League members from 1923–51 and Bill Lacey and Neil McBain played for all three of Everton, Liverpool and New Brighton. In addition, John Whitehead played for Liverpool, Everton and also for Bootle in their one year as a league team (1892/93), before they were replaced in Division 2 by Liverpool.\n\nHis physical approach as centre forward, coupled with his determination soon made him a crowd favourite. Off the pitch, Hickson was a different man, quiet and unassuming, but the Dave Hickson that pulled on a Blue shirt and entered battle every Saturday afternoon was an aggressive character, no quarter given or asked. This aggression would lead to several run-ins with officials, and three sendings-off during his career, but that was his style & the fans loved it. A youthful Hickson with his striking appearance, fully quiffed up with a shock of blonde hair, as was the style of the day, was one of the few things to get excited about on the terraces of Goodison Park. Dave Hickson soon forged a productive partnership with John Willie Parker, with Hickson being the target man. Although his reputation as an aerial threat was well known, Hickson was also a difficult opponent with the ball on the floor, and could produce a powerful shot, which earned him the nickname Cannonball Kid.\n\nOn 8 July 2013, Hickson died after a short illness, at the age of 83. His funeral service was held on 25 July 2013 at Liverpool Cathedral.\n\n"}

They first achieved fame as the UK's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest and went on to become a moderately popular act until the group disbanded in early 2001.\n\nPrecious were established in late 1998 by friends Sophie McDonnell and Jenny Frost. A set of auditions saw the remaining members join: Anya Lahiri, Kalli Clark-Sternberg and Louise Rose. Rose took up lead vocals.\n\nThe following year saw things take off rapidly for the group. In May 1999, Precious were voted in to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest. Their song \"Say It Again\" proved popular and the group were able to sign with EMI to release the song as a single on the 17 May. It debuted at No. 6 in the UK singles chart. In the Eurovision Song Contest, Precious did not carry off the grand prix with \"Say It Again\", sharing 12th position, but this was not to stop them from pursuing a pop career.\n\nPrecious went on to put together their debut self-titled album. It featured a number of tracks, including \"Say It Again\", with songwriters and producers such as the Danish, Cutfather, and Joe and Chris Porter. The debut album was released 20 November 2000. As the group went public, promoting widely through 1999 and into 2000, the next single was due. On the 20 March 2000 they released their second single \"Rewind\", which reached No. 11 in the UK. Precious released their third single, \"It's Gonna Be My Way\", on 26 June 2000 and it reached No. 27. Their last single was \"New Beginning\", with a video clip set in an industrial warehouse showing the group acting like tough girls. The song failed to make an impact on the UK Singles Chart; it reached No. 50, becoming their only single not to reach the top 40. One of the songs from their debut album, \"I Count the Minutes\", was originally recorded by Puerto Rican artist Ricky Martin from his 1999 self-titled debut English album.\n\nBy the end of 2000, Precious as a group came under scrutiny. The group's success diminished after their debut album failed to chart, selling fewer than 600 copies. The group were dropped by their label and it was decided that the individual members should pursue separate careers in early 2001. It would not be the last that the public would hear from members of the group, with McDonnell presenting for BBC TV and Radio including their CBBC brand; Frost replacing Kerry Katona in the group Atomic Kitten; and Lahiri returning to her modelling activities. Lahiri was one of the FHM Pit Girls in 2003, and she started a new career as an actress, performing with Jacqueline Bisset and Daniel Bernhardt. Lead singer Rose has also become an actress; her credits include the 2008 mini-series \"Diamonds\". Clark-Sternberg has since become a session singer.\n\n"}

This is a result of confinement. If one could \"solve\" the QCD partition function, (such that the degrees of freedom in the Lagrangian are replaced by hadrons) then one could extract information about low-energy physics. To date this has not been accomplished.\n\nBecause QCD becomes non-perturbative at low energy, it is impossible to use perturbative methods to extract information from the partition function of QCD. Lattice QCD is an alternative method that has proved successful in extracting non-perturbative information.\n\nAccording to Steven Weinberg, an effective theory can be useful if one writes down all terms consistent with the symmetries of the parent theory. In general there are an infinite number of terms which meet this requirement. Therefore in order to make any physical predictions, one assigns to the theory a power-ordering scheme which organizes terms by some pre-determined degree of importance. The ordering allows one to keep some terms and omit all other, higher-order corrections which can safely be temporarily ignored.\n\nThere are several power counting schemes in ChPT. The most widely used one is the formula_1-expansion. However, there also exist the formula_2, formula_3 and formula_4 expansions. All of these expansions are valid in finite volume, (though the formula_1 expansion is the only one valid in infinite volume.) Particular choices of finite volumes require one to use different reorganizations of the chiral theory in order to correctly understand the physics. These different reorganizations correspond to the different power counting schemes.\n\nIn addition to the ordering scheme, most terms in the approximate Lagrangian will be multiplied by \"coupling constants\" which represent the relative strengths of the force represented by each term. Values of these constants – also called low-energy constants or LECs – are usually not known. The constants can be determined by fitting to experimental data or be derived from underlying theory.\n\nThe Lagrangian of the \"p\"-expansion is constructed by writing down all interactions which are not excluded by symmetry, and then ordering them based on the number of momentum and mass powers.\n\nThe order is chosen so that formula_6 is considered in the first-order approximation, where formula_7 is the pion field and formula_8 the pion mass, which breaks the underlying chiral symmetry explicitly (PCAC).\nTerms like formula_9 are part of other, higher order corrections.\n\nIt is also customary to compress the Lagrangian by replacing the single pion fields in each term with an infinite series of all possible combinations of pion fields. One of the most common choices is\nwhere formula_11 = 93 MeV.\n\nIn general, different choices of the normalization for formula_11 exist, so that one must choose the value that is consistent with the charged pion decay rate.\n\nThe effective theory in general is non-renormalizable, however given a particular power counting scheme in ChPT, the effective theory is renormalizable at a given order in the chiral expansion. For example, if one wishes to compute an observable to formula_13, then one must compute the contact terms that come from the formula_13 Lagrangian (this is different for an SU(2) vs. SU(3) theory) at tree-level and the one-loop contributions from the formula_15 Lagrangian.)\n\nOne can easily see that a one-loop contribution from the formula_15 Lagrangian counts as formula_13 by noting that the integration measure counts as formula_18, the propagator counts as formula_19, while the derivative contributions count as formula_20. Therefore, since the calculation is valid to formula_13, one removes the divergences in the calculation with the renormalization of the low-energy constants (LECs) from the formula_13 Lagrangian. So if one wishes to remove all the divergences in the computation of a given observable to formula_23, one uses the coupling constants in the expression for the formula_23 Lagrangian to remove those divergences.\n\nThe theory allows the description of interactions between pions, and between pions and nucleons (or other matter fields). SU(3) ChPT can also describe interactions of kaons and eta mesons, while similar theories can be used to describe the vector mesons. Since chiral perturbation theory assumes chiral symmetry, and therefore massless quarks, it cannot be used to model interactions of the heavier quarks.\n\nFor an SU(2) theory the leading order chiral Lagrangian is given by\nwhere formula_26 MeV and formula_27 is the quark mass matrix. In the formula_1-expansion of ChPT, the small expansion parameters are\n\nwhere formula_30 is the chiral symmetry breaking scale, of order 1 GeV (sometimes estimated as\nformula_31).\nIn this expansion, formula_27 counts as formula_15 because formula_34 to leading order in the chiral expansion.\n\nIn some cases, chiral perturbation theory has been successful in describing the interactions between hadrons in the non-perturbative regime of the strong interaction. For instance, it can be applied to few-nucleon systems, and at next-to-next-to-leading order in the perturbative expansion, it can account for three-nucleon forces in a natural way.\n\n"}
{"id": "2143141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143141", "title": "Julian Beever", "text": "Julian Beever\n\nJulian Beever (born c. 1959) is a British sidewalk chalk artist who has been creating \"trompe-l'œil\" chalk drawings on pavement surfaces since the mid-1990s. He uses a projection technique called anamorphosis to create the illusion of three dimensions when viewed from the correct angle. He preserves his work in photographs, often positioning a person within the image as if they were interacting with the scene.\n\nBeever grew up in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, near the geographical centre of England. His talent in drawing had emerged by the time he was 5 years old; he liked school, especially his art classes. \n\nAt the age of 18, he chose to study art, design, and psychology (as a last-minute substitute for English). He continued to excel in art, found design to be tedious, and discovered new insights into visual perception, depth perception, and the eye and brain in his psychology studies. After a gap year working as a laborer and carpet-layer's assistant, Beever enrolled in a Foundation Art course at Leicester Polytechnic, where he enjoyed experimenting with a variety of modern art forms. \n\nHe started a three-year course of study for a BA in Fine Arts at Leeds Polytechnic, but found the larger school and its self-consciously avant-garde atmosphere mean and unsympathetic. When placed on academic probation, Beever decided to focus on traditional techniques, developing meticulous skills in portraying water surfaces. He later has said that in three years of college, he learned little that could not have acquired on his own, but he did pick up skills in pastel crayons that would become key to his later career.\n\nA chance encounter at the 1983 Stonehenge Free Festival with a juggler inspired Beever to take up the skill a few months before his graduation. Overcoming his introversion and shyness, he learned from other jugglers how to flourish as a street performer. He then decided to combine performance with his artistic skills by building and operating a portable \"Punch and Judy\" puppet theater, but eventually found the repetitious performances to be boring. He observed street artists at work, and realised that he could use his strengths in drawing, and tour freely carrying only a box of sidewalk chalk instead of a bulky booth and puppets. He had always wanted to travel, and found that he could finance overseas trips by working as a freelance pavement artist.\n\nBeever learned how to pick locations and images that would earn him good tips from delighted onlookers. He found a favourite spot in Brussels, Belgium, where he did crowd-pleasing renditions of the \"Mona Lisa\", the Belgian royal family, and the famous \"Manneken Pis\" statue. It was there that he made his artistic breakthrough with \"Swimming pool in the high street\", his first major anamorphic work.\n\nBeever begins by sketching his concepts on paper. Once the image is finalised, a camera is placed at the intended location from which the artwork is expected to be viewed. From this time onwards, Beever evaluates his work in progress only through the fixed lens of his camera. He observes the classic rules of perspective, occasionally placing a short piece of rope in the scene to evaluate the curve of a line.\n\nHe carefully selects suitable surfaces to hold his art. He has written: \"Good quality pastels used on a good cement or stone surface can give an effect second to none – better than on paper\".\n\nOnce the artwork is completed, Beever takes multiple photographs to document and preserve his work, often posing himself or other people within the scene to reinforce the visual effect. When he plans to use a wide-angle lens to take a picture from a closer distance, his drawing must be carefully predistorted to compensate for the lens distortion.\n\nBeever works internationally as a freelance artist, creating commissioned murals for companies and institutions, and producing hundreds of works across Europe, the US, and Australia.\n\nBesides his pavement art, Beever also paints murals with acrylic paints and replicas of the works of masters and oil paintings, and creates collages. Among his other work are drawings, usually themed around music.\n\nIn 2010, Beever released \"Pavement Chalk Artist\", a book which includes photographs of many of his works from around the world.\n\n\n"}

This name is also given to a spy at White Sands Missile Range, located further south near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Evidence for his or her existence is based on a few references in KGB archives opened (and later closed) to researchers in the early 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union. There are also a few references to Perseus in the Venona project decrypts as PERS. The identity of this person, or even whether or not they actually existed, is unknown, and many of the facts in the matter are questionable.\n\nThe first person to publicly write about atomic spy Perseus was Russian intelligence Colonel Vladimir Chikov. Starting in 1991 he wrote a number of articles in Russian periodicals that discussed Perseus. Later in 1996 he published a book with American co-author Gary Kern titled, \"How Stalin Stole the Atomic Bomb from the Americans\" (published in France in French).\n\nThe Venona project messages contain the unidentified codename \"PERS.\" Not only is \"pers\" the linguistic root of the word Perseus but the messages suggest that PERS was a Soviet source on the Manhattan Project. In addition to this, many other individuals, including some associated with the KGB, have affirmed either the specific existence of Perseus or that there remain unidentified atomic spies on the Manhattan Project. According to Chikov, Perseus was at Los Alamos in 1943, a year before known spy Klaus Fuchs was assigned there, and in the 1950s Perseus was under the control of Rudolf Abel.\n\nIn 1999, arms-control advocate Jeremy Stone alleged that Perseus was \"Scientist X\", easily identifiable as MIT physicist Philip Morrison. This was a sensational claim because accuser and accused were both highly regarded within the same academic community. Morrison denied that he was a spy and pointed out numerous discrepancies between his biography and that attributed to Perseus. While Stone accepted Morrison's denial and apologized \"for the unfavorable publicity\", he never fully withdrew the original allegation.\n\nUS Cold War historian John Earl Haynes believes that Perseus is \"a faked composite by Vladimir Chikov and the SVR combining part of the story of Theodore Hall with misdirection and distortion\". citing Gary Kern\n\n\n"}

It was originally formed in London to promote performances of instrumental music there. Many distinguished composers and performers have taken part in its concerts. It is now a membership society, and while it no longer has its own orchestra, it continues a wide-ranging programme of activities which focus on composers and young musicians and aim to engage audiences so that future generations will enjoy a rich and vibrant musical life. Since 1989 it has promoted the annual Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards for live music-making in the United Kingdom. The RPS is a registered UK charity No. 213693. It is located at 48 Great Marlborough Street in London.\n\nThe society's Gold Medal for outstanding musicianship is awarded only occasionally. the Society's CEO is James Murphy and it is chaired by John Gilhooly.\n\nIn London, at a time when there were no permanent London orchestras, nor organised series of chamber music concerts, a group of thirty music professionals formed the \"Philharmonic Society of London\" on 6 February 1813. The idea was that by cooperating, they could build a stronger orchestra than by competing against one another. However, given the organization's choice to hold its concerts at the Argyll Rooms, it is likely that the society was initiated because of John Nash's bold urban redesign of Regent Street. In this way, the society would gain an impressive performing space once the old Argyll Rooms had to be rebuilt due to the Regent Street plan, and Prince regent George IV could promote classical music as a British institution and thereby improve his reputation. Concerts were held in the Argyll Rooms until it burned down in 1830.\n\nThe Society's aim was \"to promote the performance, in the most perfect manner possible of the best and most approved instrumental music\". The first concert, on 8 March 1813, was presided over by Johann Peter Salomon, with Muzio Clementi at the piano and the violin prodigy Nicolas Mori as lead violinist, performing symphonies by Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Among the founders were the pianist and violinist William Dance (who became the society's first director and treasurer until his death in 1840), composer Henry Bishop, and Charles Neate, a pianist and friend of Beethoven, who publicised Beethoven's music at the Society.\n\nThe Society asked Beethoven to come to London, but the composer's health prevented his accepting the invitation. However the society's request for a new symphony from him resulted in the \"Choral Symphony\". In 1827 Beethoven wrote to the society outlining his straitened circumstances; at a special general meeting the society resolved to send the composer £100 immediately (; George Bernard Shaw once referred to this as \"the only entirely creditable incident in English history\"). Other works written for the Society include the \"Italian Symphony\" by Felix Mendelssohn. Distinguished conductors included Ludwig Spohr, one of the first conductors to use a baton, Hector Berlioz, who conducted a concert of his works in 1853, Richard Wagner, who conducted the whole 1855 season of orchestral concerts, William Sterndale Bennett for the following ten years, Arthur Sullivan, and Tchaikovsky, who conducted his own works in 1888 and 1893.\n\nFrom 1830 to 1869, the Society gave its concerts in the concert-hall of Hanover Square Rooms, which had seating for only about 800. The Society decided to move permanently to St James's Hall, and a complimentary additional concert, held at the hall, was given to its subscribers at the end of the 1868–69 season. Charles Santley, Charles Hallé, Thérèse Tietjens and Christina Nilsson were the soloists. When the move was made, the Society remodelled its charges to obtain a wider audience and compete with the Crystal Palace and other large venues, and introduced annotated programmes. The Society remained at the hall until 28 February 1894, when it moved to the Queen's Hall.\n\nThe society became the \"Royal Philharmonic Society\" during its 100th concert season in 1912, and continued organising concerts through the two world wars. It is now a membership society which \"seeks to create a future for music through the encouragement of creativity, the recognition of excellence and the promotion of understanding.\"\n\n\nThe Gold Medal was first awarded in 1871. The medal depicts the profile of a bust of Beethoven by Johann Nepomuk Schaller (1777–1842) which was presented to the society in 1870, Beethoven's centenary. It is awarded for \"outstanding musicianship\", and is given rarely — in 2015 the medal was awarded for the hundredth time.\n\nThrough awarding honorary membership the society recognises \"services to music\". Like the Gold Medal, honorary membership is awarded rarely; first awarded in 1826, by 2006 only 117 honorary members had been created.\n\n\n\n \n"}

The company reinvests about 60pc of its profits into grower training and development programmes.\n\nIn February 2004, the company released more share floats on the stock market in a move to raise $9.1 million.\n\nIn 2007, the company's market share for hot drinks equated to 34%, 32%, and 14% respectively of the UK's Fairtrade coffee, tea, and drinking chocolate markets. In the overall market, Cafédirect is the fifth largest coffee brand and seventh largest tea brand in the UK.\n\nIn May 2014, Café Direct purchased Kopi, one of the largest coffee subscription services in the UK. In April 2019, Cafédirect partnered with Waitrose to launch a small batch of premium coffee products.\n\nCafédirect has established the Gold Standard, a guarantee to pay above the world market price for coffee, and to support the development of producers. Between 2004 and 2009, Cafédirect paid more than £7.5 million above the market price to growers (including Fairtrade premiums), invested over £3 million in tailor-made programmes to strengthen growers’ businesses, which represents more than 50% of the company's profits and in total, paid more than £10.5 million towards the businesses and communities of their grower partners.\n\nIn addition to paying a fair price to growers in developing countries, the company donates a percentage of its profits to producers for activities such as market information and management training. Its Producer Partnership Programme (PPP) \"was set up in 1996 and goes above and beyond Fairtrade criteria\". In 2007, the company invested £600,000 in PPP and these investments attracted, without additional cost to the company, matched funds of £700,000, meaning growers benefited from a total investment of £1.3 million.\n\n\n\n"}

It lies between the Danube, its tributary Little Danube and Váh. The island is a major part of the Danubian Flat. It is the biggest river island in Europe with an area of , being long and wide.\n\nThe main towns on the island are Komárno (Révkomárom), Dunajská Streda (Dunaszerdahely) and Šamorín (Somorja). Boroughs of Bratislava, Vrakuňa and Podunajské Biskupice are also located on the island. The Slovnaft refinery is also located on the island. The island is the biggest drinking water reservoir in Slovakia, and one of the biggest in Europe, as well. Because of its warm climate, good soils and water reservoirs it is an important agricultural region, with the best conditions for crop production. It is the most fertile region in Slovakia, causing the majority of the island to be deforested.\n\nSouthern parts of Žitný ostrov by the Danube are protected by Dunajské luhy Protected Landscape Area.\n\nCurrent slovak name of the island is modern and it's derived from the phonetic similarity of German \"Schütt\" (meaning dike) and Slovak \"žito\" (rye). This name was accepted and is commonly used also because of the fact, that the island is very fertile region used for crop production.\n\nThe original name of the island is of Hungarian origin (1250 \"Chollocuz\"). Stanislav incorrectly reconstructed the name as \"*Čalov\" (like Czech Čálovice, Serbian Čalovići or Polish Nieczałów, Varsik as \"*Čelov\" (like Čelovce in Eastern Slovakia). The Hungarian name \"Csallóköz\" is derived from the old Hungarian name of the Little Danube - \"Csalló\".\n\n"}

Its heaviest munition was a diameter, shell, and the range for its lightest shell of was just over . Each gun had to be accompanied by a crane, a two-piece heavy transport set of railcars, and several modified tanks to carry shells.\n\nSeven guns were built, six of which saw combat between 1941 and 1945. It was used in attacking the Soviet fortresses of Brest-Litovsk and Sevastopol, bombarded Polish resistance fighters in Warsaw, participated in the Battle of the Bulge, and was used to try to destroy the Ludendorff Bridge during the Battle of Remagen. One Karl-Gerät has survived and the remainder were scrapped after the war.\n\nIn March 1936 Rheinmetall made a proposal for a super-heavy howitzer to attack the Maginot Line. Their initial concept was for a weapon that would be transported by several tracked vehicles and assembled on site, but the lengthy preparation time drove them to change it to a self-propelled weapon in January 1937. Extensive driving trials took place in 1938 and 1939 using the first Neubaufahrzeug tank prototype and a scale model to investigate the extremely high ground pressure and steering of such an enormous vehicle. Firing trials took place in June 1939. The full-scale driving trials were held at Unterlüss in May 1940. General Karl Becker of the Artillery was involved in the development, from whom the huge weapon gained its nickname.\n\nIn total, seven \"Karl-Gerät\" howitzers were manufactured. The first six had the nicknames \"Adam\" (later \"Baldur\"), \"Eva\" (later \"Wotan\"), \"Thor\", \"Odin\", \"Loki\", and \"Ziu\"; the seventh, the research and test weapon (Versuchs-Gerät), had no name. Delivery of the six production vehicles took place from November 1940 to August 1941.\n\nIn February 1941, discussions commenced concerning increasing the range of the weapon, and in May 1942, \"Gerät 041\" barrels were ordered for the six vehicles. At a conference with Adolf Hitler in March 1943 it was stated that the first \"Gerät 041\" would be delivered by June 1943, and the third, by mid-August. Only three of the \"Gerät 041\" barrels were actually completed for mounting on Karl-Gerät Nr. I, IV and V, although any vehicle could be converted to use the smaller weapon.\n\nTwenty-two Panzer IV Ausf. D, E and F chassis were modified with a superstructure capable of carrying four shells that replaced the turret and outfitted with a crane as \"Munitionsschlepper für Karl-Gerät\" ammunition transporters/loaders. Two or three of these \"Munitionsschlepper\" were assigned to each weapon.\n\n\nThe 124-ton vehicle was propelled by a Daimler-Benz MB 503A 12-cylinder liquid-cooled gasoline engine or a Daimler-Benz MB 507C 12-cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine, but this was mainly used for aiming (the mount had only 4 degrees of traverse on each side), as the engines provided a top speed of only . For longer distances the \"Karl-Gerät\" was disassembled using a special mobile crane into seven loads. The chassis was loaded onto a six-axle Culemeyer-Strassenroller lowboy trailer. The other parts of the gun were lighter and used four-axle trailers. If the trailer with the chassis on board had to cross a bridge that couldn't carry their combined weight the chassis had to be off-loaded and driven across under its own power.\n\nThe weapon was moved long distances via rail on a variant of a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies. When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from railcars' supporting arms and driven to its intended firing location. The chassis of the ordnance was then lowered to the ground by \"raising\" the continuous track units' roadwheels by rotating their torsion-bar-sprung suspension arms to drop the chassis close to the ground to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing - the roadwheels for each trackset were also similarly \"raised\" to allow the tracks to clear the rails while being transported by rail, between the pair of Schnabel railcars. The \"Karl-Gerät\" proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the land to be used for the ordnance's firing position had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc. The mortar itself could only be loaded at zero elevation, so it had to be re-aimed between every shot.\n\nThe various \"Karl-Geräte\" used two different types of transmissions, engines and suspension system in a bewildering set of combinations. The table below outlines how each vehicle was outfitted. After May 1944 the gasoline engines were replaced by diesels. Little information is available for No. VII, the experimental model, and the data below must be regarded as unconfirmed.\n\nThe original heavy 600 mm concrete-piercing shells (\"schwere Betongranate\") made a crater up to wide and deep. More range was desired and the light concrete-piercing shell (\"leichte Betongranate) 040\" was introduced in 1942. Firing trials for the 54 cm shells were not completed until the end of 1944 and they were not used in combat before then. The original 60 cm heavy shell had no designation other than the name. The \"Gerät\" number was added for the newer shells.\nOn 3 January 1941 \"Heavy Battery (schwere Batterie) 833\" was created at the Bergen training ground and ordered to be combat ready by 15 February 1941. On 2 April 1941 it was expanded into \"Heavy Artillery Battalion (schwere Artillerie Bataillon) 833\". The original \"Batterie 833\" was redesignated as the first battery of the new battalion and a new second battery was formed, each battery having two howitzers, with orders to be combat ready by 1 May 1941 in preparation for Operation Barbarossa. Initially a single battery was to be deployed against the Soviet fortress at Brest-Litovsk, but that was changed by 14 May 1941 when the other battery was ordered to attack the Soviet border fortifications near Lviv. The first battery was assigned to IV Army Corps of 17th Army of Army Group South near Lviv while the second battery was ordered to support the attack by the 4th Army of Army Group Center against the Brest Fortress. The batteries were issued 60 and 36 rounds respectively.\n\nLittle is known of \"First Battery's\" operations except that IV Army Corps reported on 23 June that the battery was no longer needed and was no longer operational due to technical deficiencies. \"Second Battery's\" weapons had some assembly problems, issues with the electrical firing mechanism and non-standard ammunition, not surprising for the \"Karl-Gerät\"'s combat debut, but managed to fire 31 of their 36 rounds by 24 June. It was ordered home that day by Army Group Center where the battalion was ordered to reform with eight 21 cm Mörser 18 howitzers on 6 August 1941.\n\nIn preparation for the attack on Sevastopol scheduled for the early summer \"Heavy Artillery Battalion 833\" was ordered to form a \"Karl-Batterie\" with three weapons on 18 February 1942, two of which were \"Thor\" and \"Odin\". Camouflaged firing positions long, wide and deep had to be dug for each howitzer to minimize Soviet counter-fire before they could move into position. On 20 May 1942 the 11th Army reported all three \"Karl-Geräte\" were at the front with a total of 72 heavy and 50 light concrete-piercing shells. LIV Army Corps reported that 19 heavy shells were fired between 2 and 6 June, 54 on 7 June and all 50 light shells between 8 and 13 June. More shells (29 heavy and 50 light) shipped to the battery before the end of the month. All 50 light shells were fired on 30 June and 25 heavy shells the following day. Many of these shells were fired at the two twin-gun armored turrets of the \"Maxim Gorkii\" coastal defense battery, although shells fired at the turrets had little effect other than to jam one of the turrets and possibly knock out electrical power to the turrets, both of which were repaired without too much trouble. They did rather more damage to the concrete structure supporting the turrets as well as the command center located some 600 meters away (called the \"Bastion\" by the Germans). On 19 July 1942 the battery was ordered to ship their weapons to Hillersleben for refurbishment. One dud shell was recovered by the Soviets and flown to Moscow for evaluation.\n\nOn 7 July 1942 \"Heavy Artillery Battalion 833\" was ordered to form another battery with one or two \"Karl-Geräte\". This was done by 15 August as \"schwere Batterie 628 (Karl)\" with two weapons, although sufficient personnel to man three guns was to be furnished by \"Heavy Artillery Battalion 833\". On 22 July the Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH)) issued an order to send the battery to \"Army Group North\" to support its planned offensive, \"Operation George (Unternehmen Georg)\", against Leningrad. The order for \"Georg\", dated 22 August, specified \"Battery 628\" with three guns, presumably with two operational guns and one in reserve was to participate. \"Army Group North\" reported the battery's arrival on 1 and 2 September 1942, but the Soviets preempted \"Georg\" with heavy attacks against the German forces besieging Leningrad so the \"Karl-Geräte\" didn't get into action.\n\nOn 18 October OKH ordered the 11th Army to transfer the battery as soon as possible to Leipzig, but the 11th Army asked to retain it to use in a new version of \"Georg\" to begin later that month. \"Georg\" was again postponed in late October, and later canceled. A new attack, code-named \"Feuerzauber\" (Fire Magic), was planned in which the battery was to participate, but it too was canceled after the Soviet encirclement of the German forces attacking Stalingrad. OKH finally recalled the battery on 4 December 1942 when it was clear that it had no mission.\n\nOKH issued orders to create a Heavy Artillery Battalion (Karl) on 4 May 1943 using the vehicles and equipment of \"Heavy Artillery Battery 628\". This became the first battery of the new battalion while the other battery was raised from scratch on 15 May as was the battalion headquarters. Each battery had two \"Karl-Geräte\" plus one in reserve. 18th Army of Army Group North had plans to use one \"Karl-Gerät\" against the Oranienbaum Bridgehead west of Leningrad during the summer of 1943, but the battalion was ordered to return the \"Karl-Geräte\" to Leipzig on 8 August. Just like the 833rd the battalion was ordered to reform with eight 21 cm Mörser 18 howitzers on 29 August 1943 with effect by 10 September. A \"Unit for Karl-Geräte (Kommando für Karl-Geräte)\" was formed on that same date as caretakers for the weapons. This was redesignated \"Unit for Special-Equipment of Heavy Artillery Battalion (motorized) (Kommando für Sonder-Gerät des schwere Artillerie-Abteilung (mot.)) 628\" on 2 June 1944.\n\nOn 13 August 1944 a battery was ordered to be created immediately with one 54 cm \"Karl-Gerät\" and sent to the 9th Army to help it suppress the Warsaw Uprising. The next day the \"Kommando für Sonder-Geräte\" formed the \"Army Artillery Battery (Static) 638 Heeres-Artillerie Batterie (bodenständige)\" with 60 cm \"Karl-Gerät\" Nr. VI \"Ziu\" since no 54 cm weapon was available and a firing table had not yet been computed. It arrived at the Warsaw West railway station at 0700 on 17 August 1944; the ammunition train arrived the following morning.\n\nThe mortar \"Ziu\" was settled in the Sowiński Park near the statue of general Józef Sowiński in Wola district. The 600mm caliber mortar shells were designed to destroy bunkers. Often they did not explode when they hit buildings or soft ground in Warsaw. On 18 August 1944 a shell fired from mortar \"Ziu\" hit the building at Moniuszki 10 street, where the famous Warsaw restaurant \"Adria\" was located. The shell broke through several stories of the building, roof and floor of the restaurant and finally stopped in the basement, but it did not explode. Sappers of Polish Home Army disarmed the dud shell and removed the explosive charge. The explosive was used to produce hand grenades (Filipinkas) for Polish soldiers. The empty shell was left in the basement. In the mid-1960s during removal of ruins of the restaurant the shell was found. It was moved to the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw, and is a part of the museum's outdoor exhibition.\n\nOn 30 August 1944, another dud shell from mortar \"Ziu\" was found in the basement of Prudential building located at Napoleon Square 9 (Plac Napoleona 9, now Plac Powstańców Warszawy). This shell was also disarmed by sappers of Polish Home Army.\n\nAfter World War II a few more 600mm dud shells were found in Warsaw. The most recent one was found on 28 August 2012 about 10m below surface of the ground in the neighborhood of Plac Powstańców Warszawy during construction of the second metro line in Warsaw.\n\nOn 24 August 1944 OKH noted that it had been very successful in combat and ordered another \"Karl-Gerät\" sent to Warsaw. A second battery, numbered 428, was formed two days later by the \"Kommando für Sonder-Geräte\", but it did not arrive at the Warsaw West railway station until 1257 on 7 September 1944. A third \"Karl-Gerät 040\" was shipped to Warsaw on 10 September and incorporated into \"Battery 428\". \"Ziu\" needed repairs and was shipped on 22 September back to Jüterbog. At some point a fourth \"Karl-Gerät\" was shipped to Warsaw as it was reported as operational on 25 September.\n\nA meeting was held on 29 September by the OKH General der Artillerie to discuss the overall status of the \"Karl-Gerät\", its supporting equipment and ammunition:\n\nThree days later Battery 638 was ordered to transfer to Budapest and was loaded without any \"Karl-Gerät\". Nr. V was rerouted to Budapest to equip the battery. Battery 428 followed on 10–11 October 1944. Both batteries were ordered back to Warsaw on 19 October, although they didn't arrive until 28 October. On 6 November Battery 638 transferred one \"Karl-Gerät 040\" to 428 and returned to Jüterbog on 10 November to rearm with a \"Gerät 041\". Battery 428 didn't remain near Warsaw much longer and departed for Jüterbog itself on 15 November.\n\nBattery 428 exchanged its guns for Nr. II and VI (both with \"Gerät 040\") and departed for the West on 14 December 1944 to participate in \"Operation Watch on the Rhine\" (Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein), which would be known by Americans as the Battle of the Bulge, but didn't reach the front until 29 December. Battery 628 followed on 20 December after equipping with Nr. IV, the first 54 cm Gerät 041 to be committed to battle.\n\nLittle is known of their activities during the battle, but \"Gerät\" Nr. II was damaged en route by a bomb and was back in Jüterbog on 6 January 1945. It was repaired using parts from Karl Nr. I by 3 February. \"Gerät\" Nr. IV was damaged by a number of penetrating hits and arrived in Jüterbog on 31 January. \"Gerät\" Nr. VI was still at the front on 19 January. In the meantime Nr. V was modified to use the 54 cm howitzer and had its engine rebuilt.\n\n\"Battery 628\" was initially ordered to the Vistula Front on 7 March, but this was countermanded on 11 March when it was rerouted towards Remagen, where the Allies had recently captured the Ludendorff Bridge. Karl-Batterie 638 arrived on 20 March, but after only 14 rounds that missed all of the bridges and only damaged a handful of random houses, the weapon had to be moved to the rear for repairs. Batterie 428 was also ordered towards Remagen on 11 March, but was rerouted to the 1st Army sector instead.\n\nA status report dated 22 March showed \"Geräte\" Nr. I and IV were still at Jüterbog, with Nr. I configured as a 040 and Nr. IV to be completed as a 041. \"Geräte\" Nr. II and V had left for the front on 11 and 10 March respectively. \"Gerät\" Nr. VI was returning to Jüterbog with engine damage. \"Gerät\" Nr. III had been virtually destroyed and only the gun breech was salvageable. \"Gerät\" Nr. VII needed parts and wasn't going to be made operational anytime soon.\n\n\"Battery 628\" was ordered disbanded on 11 April and its personnel incorporated into \"Battery 428\", although it's unlikely that either unit actually saw action except in local defense.\n\nIn 1945, Nr. II (\"Eva\") as well as Nr. V (\"Loki\") were captured by US forces in the period 21 March to 11 April 1945. Nr. VII, the test weapon, was captured by the US Army in Hillersleben and shipped to Aberdeen Proving Grounds but later scrapped. Nr. VI (\"Ziu\") was captured by the Red Army, probably when they overran Jüterbog on 20 April 1945. This is on display at the Kubinka tank museum, although marked as Nr. I (\"Adam\"). Nr. IV (\"Odin\") was also captured by the Red Army. The fates of guns Nr. I (\"Adam\") and Nr. III (\"Thor\") are not known. It is probable both were captured by the Red Army as their last known location was in Jüterbog, less than a month earlier.\n\n\n\n"}

It was essentially the ultimate development of the company's Kestrel engine, which had seen widespread use in military aircraft of the pre-war period.\n\nDue to the wartime priority of Rolls-Royce Merlin development and production, the Peregrine saw limited use and was cancelled with only 301 engines being built.\n\nDuring the 1930s the use of superchargers to increase \"effective displacement\" of an aircraft engine came into common use. Charging — the compression of the intake air to increase mass flow-rate and oxygen available for combustion — of some form was a requirement for high-altitude flight and as the power of engines improved there was no reason not to use it all the time. The Kestrel used supercharging for boost from the start but by the 1930s it had reached the limits of what its frame could handle in power output. There was room to improve the strength of the engine, which would allow it to run at even higher boost with only modest increases in weight. This improved the power-to-weight ratio considerably and it was generally felt that the design would be the \"standard\" fighter engine for the impending war.\n\nFollowing the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey, started by managing director, Claude Johnson, in 1915 with the Eagle, Hawk and Falcon engines, Rolls-Royce named the engine the \"Peregrine\" after the peregrine falcon. The engine was produced in right- and left-hand tractor variants to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller. This was common on German designs but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller reduction gear. Four Kestrel/Peregrine cylinder banks attached to one crankcase and driving a common crankshaft would produce the contemporary Rolls-Royce Vulture, a X-24 which would be used for bombers.\n\nAircraft designs rapidly increased in size and power requirements to the point where the Peregrine was too small to be useful. Although the Peregrine appeared to be a satisfactory design, it was never allowed to mature since Rolls-Royce concentrated on refining and producing the Merlin. The Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft: the Westland Whirlwind and the Gloster F.9/37. The Vulture was fitted to the Hawker Tornado and Avro Manchester, but proved unreliable in service. With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the range, the Peregrine was cancelled in 1943.\n\nThe two aircraft types that used the Peregrine, the Westland Whirlwind and the second prototype of the Gloster F9/37, were twin-engine designsthe prototype F9/37 had used the Bristol Taurus radial engine. The Air Ministry requirement for the F9/37, a cannon-armed fighter (the Hurricane and Spitfire were armed with machine guns only at this point), was curtailed and there was no further progress with the design. The Whirlwind, despite having excellent low-altitude performance, proved uneconomical compared with single-engined fighters and also suffered as a consequence of the Peregrine's unreliability. Low output of Peregrine engines caused delays in delivery for squadron use.\n\nIn August 1940 Ernest Hives, head of the Rolls-Royce aero engine division, wrote to Air Chief Marshal Wilfrid Freeman expressing his wish to stop work on the Peregrine, Vulture and another engine development project, the Rolls-Royce Exe, to concentrate efforts on the Merlin and Griffon but Freeman disagreed and stated that Peregrine production should continue. While reliability problems were not uncommon for new Rolls-Royce engines of the era, the company's testing department was told to spend all of their time on developing the more powerful Merlin to maturity. As a result of the priority given to the Merlin, the unreliable Peregrine was eventually abandoned with production ending in 1942. Other cannon-armed fighters such as the Hawker Typhoon and the Bristol Beaufighter were becoming available and as the Whirlwind had been designed around the Peregrine, changing to a different engine was not practical. Only 116 Whirlwinds and a corresponding number of Peregrines were built (301).\n\n\n\n"}

In Roman times, the fort was known as \"Banna\" (\"horn\" in Celtic), reflecting the geography of the site.\n\nCumbria County Council were responsible for the management of Birdoswald fort from 1984 until the end of 2004, when English Heritage assumed responsibility.\n\nThe fort was occupied by Roman auxiliaries from approximately AD 112 to AD 400. In this western part of Hadrian's Wall, the wall itself was originally built from turf, later replaced with stone (Hogan, 2007). The stone fort was built some time after the wall, in the usual playing card shape, with gates to the east, west and south. Inside were built the usual stone buildings, a central headquarters building (\"principia\"), granaries (\"horrea\"), and barracks. Unusually for an auxiliary fort, it also included an exercise building (\"basilica exercitatoria\"), perhaps reflecting the difficulties of training soldiers in the exposed site in the north of England.\n\nThe fort has been extensively excavated for over a century, with twentieth century excavations starting in 1911 by F.G. Simpson and continuing with Ian Richmond from 1927 to 1933 . The gateways and walls were then re-excavated under the supervision of Brenda Swinbank and J P Gillam from 1949-1950. Excavations between 1987 and 1992 showed an unbroken sequence of occupation on the site of the fort granaries, running from the late Roman period until possibly 500AD. The granaries were replaced by two successive large timber halls, reminiscent of others found in many parts of Britain dating to the 5th and 6th centuries. Tony Wilmott (director of the excavations) has suggested that, after the end of Roman rule in Britain, the fort served as the power-base for a local warband descended from the late Roman garrison and possibly deriving legitimacy from their ancestors for several generations.\n\nExtensive geophysical surveys, both magnetometry and earth resistance survey, were conducted by TimeScape Surveys (Alan Biggins & David Taylor, 1999 & 2004) between 1997 -2001. These surveys established that the sub-surface remains in the fort were well preserved. The later surveys detected two vici (civilian settlements) of different characters on the eastern and western sides of the fort. The surveys by TimeScape also determined the location of a bathhouse in the valley of the River Irthing.\n\nAn area between the fort and the escarpment was excavated by Channel 4's archaeological television programme \"Time Team\" in January 2000. The excavation detected signs of an extramural settlement (\"vicus\"), but the area is liable to erosion and the majority of the vicus could have fallen over the cliffs.\n\nThe two mile sector of Hadrian's Wall either side of Birdoswald is also of major interest. It is currently the only known sector of Hadrian's Wall in which the original turf wall was later replaced by a stone wall on a different line. When the rebuilding took place (probably in the 130s) the line of the wall was moved approximately 50 metres further north, to line up with the fort's north wall, rather than its east and west gates. The reasons for this change are unclear, although David Woolliscroft (Woolliscroft, 2001) has plausibly suggested that it was the result of changing signalling requirements. At any rate, this remains the only area in which both the walls can be directly compared.\n\nApproximately 600 metres east of Birdoswald, at the foot of an escarpment, lies the remains of Willowford bridge. This carried Hadrian's Wall across the River Irthing. The westward movement of the river course over the centuries has left the east abutment of the bridge high and dry, while the west abutment has probably been destroyed by erosion. Nevertheless, the much-modified visible remains are highly impressive. Until 1996, these remains were not directly accessible from the fort, but they can now be reached by a footbridge that was lowered into position by an RAF Chinook helicopter.\n\nThe fort at Birdoswald was linked by a Roman road, sometimes referred to as the Maiden Way, to the outpost fort of Bewcastle, seven miles to the north. Signals could be relayed between the two forts by means of two signalling towers.\n\nToday the fort's site is operated by English Heritage as Birdoswald Roman Fort. The visitor centre features displays and reconstructions of the fort, exhibits about life in Roman Britain, the site's history through the ages, and archaeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries. Visitors can walk outside along the excavated remains of the fort.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2143256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143256", "title": "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid", "text": "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\n\nPat Garrett and Billy the Kid is a 1973 American revisionist western drama film directed by Sam Peckinpah, written by Rudy Wurlitzer, and starring James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson, Richard Jaeckel, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills, Barry Sullivan, Jason Robards and Bob Dylan. The film is about an aging Pat Garrett (Coburn), hired as a lawman by a group of wealthy New Mexico cattle barons to bring down his old friend Billy the Kid (Kristofferson).\n\nDylan composed the score and songs for the film, most prominently \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", which were released on its soundtrack album the same year. It was filmed on location in Durango, Mexico, and was nominated for two BAFTA Awards for Film Music (Dylan) and Most Promising Newcomer (Kristofferson). It was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of Best Original Score (Dylan).\n\nThe film was noted for behind-the-scenes battles between Peckinpah and the studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Soon after completion, the film was taken away from the director and substantially re-edited, resulting in a truncated version released to theaters and largely disowned by cast and crew members. Peckinpah's preview version was released on video in 1988, leading to a re-evaluation, with many critics hailing it as a mistreated classic and one of the era's best films. It is ranked 126th on \"Empire\" magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".\n\nIn 1881 in Old Fort Sumner, New Mexico, William H. Bonney, known as Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson), is passing the time with friends shooting chickens for fun. An old friend of Billy's, Pat Garrett (James Coburn), rides into town with Deputy Sheriff J. W. Bell (Matt Clark) and joins the diversion. Later, over drinks, Garrett informs Billy that the electorate want him out of the country, and that in five days, when he becomes Sheriff of Lincoln County, he will make Billy leave.\n\nSix days later, Garrett and his deputies surround the small farmhouse where Billy and his gang are holed up. In the ensuing gun battle, Charlie Bowdre (Charles Martin Smith) and several other men on both sides are killed, and Billy is taken prisoner. As Billy awaits his execution in the Lincoln County Jail for the killing of Buckshot Roberts, he is taunted and beaten by self-righteous Deputy Sheriff Bob Olinger (R. G. Armstrong) while the hangman's gallows are being built nearby. Garrett warns Olinger not to taunt Billy again or he will be fired and sent back to Texas; then, Garrett leaves town to collect taxes leaving his two deputies to guard Billy. Olinger again argues with Billy but after J. W. Bell intervenes, Olinger leaves to get a drink. Billy finds a gun hidden for him in the outhouse and shoots Bell in the back. He then retrieves Olinger's shotgun loaded with \"sixteen thin dimes\" and shoots Olinger dead in the street, saying, \"Keep the change, Bob.\" Billy leaves town.\n\nAfter Garrett returns to Lincoln and recruits a new deputy sheriff named Alamosa Bill Kermit (Jack Elam), he rides to Santa Fe to meet with Governor Lew Wallace (Jason Robards), who introduces him to a pair of powerful men from the Santa Fe Ring. They offer a thousand dollars for the capture of Billy the Kid, with five hundred dollars upfront. Garrett rejects the money saying they can pay him in full when Billy is brought in and warns them that he will be successful as long as another cattle war is not started. Meanwhile, Billy returns to his gang at Old Fort Sumner, where he decides to lie back for a few days. He is confronted by three strangers looking to kill him; all three are killed in the subsequent shootout, helped by another stranger called Alias (Bob Dylan), who kills one of the men with a knife through the neck. Alias had witnessed Billy's escape from the Lincoln County Jail.\n\nGarrett meets up with Sheriff Colin Baker (Slim Pickens), hoping he can provide information on Billy's whereabouts. Baker and his wife (Katy Jurado) go with Garrett to arrest some of Billy's old gang. In a gunfight, the gang members including Black Harris (L. Q. Jones) are killed and Baker is mortally wounded. Baker's wife comforts the dying lawman as he waits to die by a river. Later that evening, Garrett watches a barge floating down a river with a man shooting bottles in the water. Garrett and the two face off briefly from a distance before lowering their rifles.\n\nGarrett is joined by a glory-seeking John W. Poe (John Beck), who works for the Santa Fe Ring. The two ride southwest to meet John Chisum (Barry Sullivan), a powerful cattle baron, who informs them that Billy has been rustling his cattle again and killed some of his men; Billy once worked for him and claimed that Chisum owes him $500 of back salary. Anticipating Garrett's arrival in Old Fort Sumner, Billy's friend Paco (Emilio Fernández) and his family leave for Mexico, soon followed by Billy. Along the way, Billy stops at the Horrell Trading Post, which is owned by an old friend. By chance, Horrell (Gene Evans) is hosting Garrett's new deputy, Alamosa Bill. After they finish eating, Billy and Alamosa step outside for a duel at ten paces, with Billy shooting Alamosa dead. Meanwhile, Garrett and Poe arrive at a saloon. Garrett tells Poe to ride on without him and that Garrett will pick him up in Roswell in five or six days. Three members of Billy's gang come into the saloon. After taunting Holly (Richard Bright) and getting him drunk, Garrett shoots him dead after he pulls a knife. He tells Alias to give Billy a message that they had \"a little drink together\".\n\nGarrett rides to Roswell ahead of Poe to gather more clues on Billy's whereabouts. Garrett beats up a prostitute named Ruthie Lee (Rutanya Alda) and learns from her that Billy is in Fort Sumner. Poe arrives in Roswell to find Garrett naked and in bed with several prostitutes, and confirms that Billy is in Fort Sumner. Garrett recruits an old friend he helped become a sheriff and along with Poe rides to Fort Sumner to find Billy. Later that night Billy and his girlfriend, the daughter of Pete Maxwell, have sex as Garrett and his two deputies arrive. Billy goes to get some meat and, after seeing Garrett's deputies (who are both afraid to shoot the Kid), backs into a bedroom where Garrett shoots him. Garrett angrily hits Poe for attempting to cut off Billy's trigger finger. He stays on the porch until morning, when the townspeople of Fort Sumner, having heard the news of his death, gather to see Billy's lifeless body. Garrett mounts his horse and rides out of town, with a small boy throwing stones at him.\n\nTwenty-eight years later in 1908, near Las Cruces, New Mexico, Garrett is riding with men working for the Santa Fe Ring, when he is ambushed and coldly killed by his very associates, including Poe.\n\nThe screenplay of \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" was written by Rudy Wurlitzer and was originally intended to be directed by Monte Hellman. The two had previously worked together on the acclaimed film \"Two-Lane Blacktop\" (1971). Sam Peckinpah became involved through actor James Coburn, who wanted to play the legendary sheriff Pat Garrett.\n\nPeckinpah believed that this was his chance to make a definitive statement on the Western genre and complete the revision that he had begun with \"Ride the High Country\" (1962) and \"The Wild Bunch\" (1969). Working with Wurlitzer, he rewrote the script in order to create a more cyclical narrative, and added a prologue and epilogue depicting Garrett's own assassination at the hands of the men who hired him to kill Billy the Kid. In the original script, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid never met onscreen until the film's conclusion, and Wurlitzer reportedly resented Peckinpah's reworking of the narrative. Wurlitzer and Peckinpah had a strained relationship, and Wurlitzer would later write a book highly unfavorable to Peckinpah.\n\nPeckinpah initially considered Bo Hopkins for the part of Billy, but he eventually cast country music star Kris Kristofferson as the outlaw. Kristofferson was 36 when the film was made, playing 21-year-old Billy. Kristofferson's band would play small roles, along with his wife Rita Coolidge. Kristofferson also brought Bob Dylan into the film, initially hired to write the title song. Dylan eventually wrote the score and played the role of \"Alias\". Peckinpah had never heard of Dylan, but was reportedly moved by hearing him play the proposed title song and hired him immediately. Among the songs written by Dylan for the film was \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\".\n\nPeckinpah deliberately cast his film's supporting roles with legendary Western character actors such as Chill Wills, Katy Jurado, Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Barry Sullivan, Dub Taylor, R.G. Armstrong, Elisha Cook, Jr., and Paul Fix. Jason Robards had starred in Peckinpah's earlier films, the television production \" Noon Wine\" (1966) and \"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\" (1970), and had a cameo appearance as the governor. The large supporting cast also included Richard Jaeckel, Charles Martin Smith, Harry Dean Stanton, Matt Clark, L.Q. Jones, Emilio Fernández, Aurora Clavel, Luke Askew, Jack Dodson, Richard Bright, and John Beck.\n\nFrom the beginning, the production was plagued with difficulties. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer President James Aubrey, for economic reasons, refused to give Peckinpah the time or budget required, forcing the director to rely on local crew members in the Mexican state of Durango. Multiple technical problems, including malfunctioning cameras, led to costly reshoots. Cast and crew members also came down with influenza. Aubrey objected to several scenes that he considered superfluous to the film's plot, and Peckinpah and his crew reportedly worked weekends and lunch hours to secretly complete the sequences. Aubrey began to send telegrams to the set complaining about the number of camera setups that Peckinpah used and the time spent to shoot specific scenes. According to producer Gordon Carroll, the movie's set was \"a battleground.\"\n\nPeckinpah was plagued by alcoholism, with which he would struggle for the remainder of his life. This, combined with his clashes with Aubrey and the studio, led to his growing reputation as a difficult, unreliable filmmaker. Reportedly, when Dylan first arrived on the set, he and Kristofferson sat to watch dailies with Peckinpah. The director was so unhappy with the footage that he angrily stood on a folding chair and urinated on the screen. Similar stories began to reach Hollywood, prompting Peckinpah to purchase a full-page ad in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" mocking the rumors and the brass at MGM. The Hollywood producers were not amused. The film finished 21 days behind schedule and $1.6 million over budget.\n\n\"Peckinpah was apt to strange behaviour and moods,\" Kristofferson recalled. \"[Dylan and I] spent a lot of time chatting in our trailers and I told him about my friend Willie Nelson. I asked Bob, 'Why isn't Willie famous? He's a genius.' So, the next day, Bob calls Willie up and gets him to come down to the set, and he made him play his old Martin guitar for ten hours straight. They ended up doing all these old Django Reinhardt tunes. It was fabulous.\"\n\nBy the time that \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" was in the editing room, Peckinpah's relationship with the studio and his own producers had reached the breaking point. Aubrey, enraged by the cost and production overruns, demanded the film for an unrealistic release date. Peckinpah and his editors were forced into a desperate situation in order to finish on time. Furthermore, Aubrey still objected to several sequences in the film which he wanted removed, forcing Peckinpah to engage in protracted negotiations over the film's content. Adding to the problems, Bob Dylan had never done a feature film score and Peckinpah's usual composer, Jerry Fielding, was unhappy with being relegated to a minor role in the scoring process.\n\nPeckinpah did complete a preview version of the film, which was shown to critics on at least one occasion. Martin Scorsese had just made \"Mean Streets\" (1973) and was at the screening, and he praised the film as Peckinpah's greatest since \"The Wild Bunch\". This version, however, would not see the light of day for over ten years. Peckinpah was eventually forced out of the production, and Aubrey had the film severely cut from 124 to 106 minutes, resulting in the film being released as a truncated version largely disowned by cast and crew members. This version was a box-office failure, grossing $8 million domestically, of which the studio earned only $2.7 million in theatrical rentals, against a budget of more than $4.6 million. However, the film grossed a total of $11 million worldwide.\n\nThe film was also panned by most major critics, who had harbored high expectations for the director's spiritual successor to \"The Wild Bunch\". Though she acknowledged its ambition and \"amazing cast\", Pauline Kael described the film as \"peculiarly unrealized\" and mused that \"probably nobody involved was very happy about the results\". Roger Ebert rated the film two stars out of four, beginning his review with: \"Sam Peckinpah attempted to have his name removed from \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" I sympathized with him. If this wasn't entirely his work, he shouldn't have had to take the blame.\" Ebert went on to note, \"Another alarming factor is that no less than six editors are credited. Not assistant editors, but editors; this sets a modern-day record, I think. My guess is that there was an argument over the movie's final form, and that Peckinpah and MGM platooned editors at each other during the battle. You'd think the executives would have figured out that their only chance was to release the movie as Peckinpah made it; audiences were more interested in the new Peckinpah film than in still another rehash of Billy the Kid.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" awarded the same two-star grade and wrote that the film \"appears to have been shot in emotional slow motion, and the self-inflating lethargy and mugging of all concerned reduces the enterprise to an exercise in pretension.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film \"has the manner of something written for Peckinpah by a writer who'd seen 'The Wild Bunch' and vowed to give the director an important script, something worthy of his talents. Instead, Mr. Wurlitzer has come up with what is apparently an unconscious parody of the Peckinpah concerns for fading frontiers, comradeship and machismo.\" Canby also found the Bob Dylan music \"so oppressive that when it stops we feel giddy with relief, as if a tooth had suddenly stopped aching.\" \"Variety\" declared, \"Whereas Peckinpah's nostalgia for a frontier world where might makes right and women were for the taking has previously been communicated via forceful acting and striking visuals, here there are few graces to camouflage the narrative banality.\"\n\nNot every contemporary review was negative. Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Although 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' (at selected theaters) is approximately 15 minutes shorter than its director Sam Peckinpah cut it, it nevertheless emerges as a remarkable film that is perhaps Peckinpah's best, most mature work to date.\" Richard Combs of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" was also generally favorable, declaring that \"for all the deliberate—and occasionally over-schematic—summation of [Peckinpah's] previous work, \"Pat Garrett\" is remarkable for its intensity of mood (and for the growling, damped-down charisma of Coburn and Kristofferson); a singularly black and poetic evocation of a no-exit life style.\"\n\nThe film remained something of an enigma for the next decade, with rumors flying about other versions and the nature of what had been left out of the release version. Peckinpah himself was in possession of his own preview version, which he often showed to friends as his own definitive vision of the film.\n\nIn 1988, Turner Home Entertainment, with distribution by MGM, released Peckinpah's preview version of \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" on video and Laserdisc. This version led to a rediscovery and reevaluation of the film, with many critics praising it as a lost masterpiece and proof of Peckinpah's vision as a filmmaker at this time. The film's reputation has grown substantially since this version was released, and the film has come to be regarded as something of a modern classic, equal in many ways to Peckinpah's earlier films. Kristofferson noted in an interview, though, that Peckinpah had felt that Dylan had been pushed on him by the studio and thus left \"Knocking on Heaven's Door\" out of the preview version. In Kristofferson's opinion, \"Heaven's Door\" \"was the strongest use of music that I had ever seen in a film. Unfortunately Sam…had a blind spot there.\"\n\nIn 2005, a DVD of the film distributed by Warner Bros. was released containing the preview version as well as a new special edition which combined elements of the theatrical version, the preview version, and several new scenes never released in the previous versions. This third version of the film, known as the \"special edition\", runs slightly shorter than the preview version.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2143274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143274", "title": "Rolls-Royce Kestrel", "text": "Rolls-Royce Kestrel\n\nThe Kestrel or type F is a 22-litre (1,342 cu in) 700-horsepower (520 kW) class V-12 aircraft engine from Rolls-Royce, their first cast-block engine and the pattern for most of their future piston-engine designs. Used during the interwar period, it provided excellent service on a number of British fighters and bombers of the era, such as the Hawker Fury and Hawker Hart family, and the Handley Page Heyford. The engine also sold to international air forces, and it was even used to power prototypes of German military aircraft types that were later used during the Battle of Britain. Several Kestrel engines remain airworthy today.\n\nThe Kestrel came about as a result of the excellent Curtiss D-12, one of the first truly successful cast-block engines. Earlier designs had used individually machined steel cylinders that were screwed onto a crankcase, whereas the cast-block design used a single block of aluminium that was machined to form cylinders. The result was both simpler to build as well as lighter and much stronger, requiring only an investment in new machining equipment.\n\nThe D-12 was one of the most powerful engines of its era, and continued to exchange records with other contemporary high-power engines. No British company could offer anything like it, and when Fairey imported 50 of the type (renaming them as the \"Fairey Felix\") the Air Ministry had enough and ordered Napier and Rolls-Royce to start work on cast-block engines of their own.\n\nArthur Rowledge, one of Napier's chief engineers and the designer of the Napier Lion engine, became fed up with management and left for Rolls. In this one move any Napier design effort ended while Rolls' received a boost. Applying every known advance since the D-12 was introduced, Rowledge designed the new engine to use supercharging at all altitudes, allowing it to outperform naturally aspirated engines by as much as they were willing to increase the boost pressure.\n\nOne key advance in the Kestrel was the use of a pressurised cooling system. Water boils at 100 °C at standard atmospheric pressure, but this temperature decreases with altitude. Since the amount of heat carried out of the engine is a function of coolant temperature and volume, the coolant has to be kept below boiling point and an increasing amount of fluid has to be used, along with an increasingly large radiator to cool it. The solution was to pressurise the entire cooling system, thereby not only preventing the decrease in cooling performance with altitude, but in fact increasing the boiling point even on the ground. The Kestrel was built to maintain enough pressure to keep the boiling point at about 150 °C.\n\nThe engine was first produced in 1927 at 450 hp (340 kW), which soon improved in the IB version to 525 hp (390 kW). This variant saw widespread use in the Hawker Hart family that was the mainstay of British air power during the early 1930s. However, it was not long before power output was increased dramatically; the V model provided 695 hp (520 kW) at 3,000 rpm with no basic change to the design, while the XVI used in the Miles Master delivered 670 hp (500 kW).\n\nMesserschmitt also tested its first Messerschmitt Bf 109 V1 prototype, bearing German civilian registration \"D-IABI\", with a Kestrel engine in 1935 as the German-designed intended engines were not yet ready. Junkers also used a Kestrel for the first prototype of the Ju 87 \"Stuka\" dive bomber. The Reich Air Ministry (RLM) acquired four Kestrel VI engines by trading Rolls-Royce a Heinkel He 70 \"Blitz\" as an engine testbed.\n\nIncreased availability of higher octane aviation fuels in the late 1930s allowed the engine to be boosted to higher power levels without suffering from detonation, and the Kestrel eventually attained a power output of 720 hp (537 kW) in the XXX variant of 1940.\n\nFurther developments of the Kestrel were the Goshawk and the Peregrine (and therefore the Vulture). In practice, development of the Peregrine and Vulture was troubled, and they were both cancelled with comparatively few built.\n\nThe Kestrel was produced in 40 distinct variants which can be divided into three main groups: normally aspirated, medium supercharged, and fully supercharged. One variant, the Kestrel VIII, was configured as a 'pusher engine' for the Short Singapore flying boat. Apart from supercharging, the variant differences centred on varying compression ratios and propeller reduction gearing.\n\n\"From Lumsden, the Kestrel may not be the main powerplant for these types.\"\n\nSeveral Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines remain in service, powering restored Hawker biplane types:\n\nPreserved examples of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine are on public display at the:\n\n\n"}

It expanded on themes explored on its predecessor \"Slow Train Coming\", with gospel arrangements and lyrics extolling the importance of a strong personal faith.\n\nThe cover of \"Saved\" originally featured a painting by Tony Wright of Jesus Christ's hand reaching down to touch the hands of his believers. However, this cover was subsequently replaced by a painting of Dylan on stage performing during that time period in order to downplay the overtly religious nature of the original cover. It has since been changed back on some re-releases. A quote inside the sleevenotes reads: \"'Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah' (Jeremiah 31:31)\".\n\nThe album hit No. 3 on the UK charts, reached No. 24 on the US charts and did not go gold. \"CCM Magazine\" described the album as an \"open declaration of Dylan's deepening faith.\" Critical reaction to the album was mixed. Robert Christgau awarded the album a \"C+\", which is described by Christgau as \"most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork\". Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", Kurt Loder praised Dylan's backing band, but felt that several songs were hampered by overtly religious messages, although he did single out \"In the Garden\" for having a \"lovely, billowing arrangement\". Loder stated that Dylan's efforts at a gospel album were not as remarkable as others \"not just because he lacks the vocal equipment but because he's too inventive, too big for the genre\", but summarised \"Saved\" as a gospel work with \"some distinction\".\n\n\nTechnical\n\nOriginally released in 1980 on LP and Cassette, the album was first reprinted in 1985 and released on CD in 1990. \"Saved\" was remastered in 2013 for the release of \"\".\n\n"}

It ultimately originated among Indian South Africans of Durban. A small version of the bunny chow that uses only a quarter loaf of bread is sometimes called, by black South Africans, a \"scambane\" or \"kota\" (\"quarter\"); it is a name that it shares with spatlo, a South African dish that evolved from the bunny chow.\n\nBunny chow is South African Indian slang for \"Gujarati food\". Bunny comes from the word \"bania\" which is the South African Indian slang for a Gujarati person.\n\nThe bunny chow was created in Durban, home to a large community of people of Indian origin. The precise origins of the food are disputed, although its creation has been dated to the 1940s. It was also sold in Gwelo, Rhodesia (now Gweru) during World War II and is still sold in the nearby town of Kadoma, formerly known as Gatooma.\n\nStories of the origin of bunny chow date as far back as the migrant Indian workers' arrival in South Africa. One account suggests that said Indian laborers who came to work the sugar cane plantations of Kwazulu-Natal (Port Natal) required a way of carrying their lunches to the field; a hollowed-out loaf of bread was a convenient way to transport their vegetarian curries. Meat-based fillings came later. The use of a loaf of white bread can also be ascribed to the lack of the traditional roti bread as well as its weak structure; thus the cheap loaf, widely available at local stores, would be an optimal substitute vessel for the curry.\n\nOne story claims that a South African restaurant run by Banias (an Indian caste) first created the dish at a restaurant-café, called Kapitan's, on the corner of Victoria and Albert streets in Durban. Another tale opines that the origin of this handheld dish was due to Indian golf caddies not being allowed to publicly carry sharp cutlery like knives during apartheid. \"\" in South African English is simply slang for \"food\" as well as the verb \"to eat\".\n\nThe traditional Indian meal was roti and beans, but rotis tended to fall apart as a take-away item. To solve this, they hollowed the centre portion of a loaf of white bread and filled it with curry, then capped the filling with the portion that was carved out. The vegetarian version of the meal is sometimes known as a \"\"beans bunny\"\". An alternate, albeit unlikely etymology is derived from a mondegreen of \"\"bun\"\" and \"\"achar\"\" (Indian pickles), though the latter are not usually included in the dish (unless as an accoutrement).\n\nBunny chows are popular amongst Indians and other ethnic groups in the Durban area. Bunny chows are commonly filled with curries made using traditional recipes from Durban: mutton or lamb, chicken, trotters & beans, bean and chips with curry gravy, fried sausage, cheese, eggs and polony are popular fillings; the original bunny chow was vegetarian. Bunny chows are often served with a side portion of grated carrot, chilli and onion salad, commonly known as sambals. A key desirable characteristic of a bunny chow is seen when gravy from the curry fillings soaks into the walls of the bread. Sharing a single bunny chow is not uncommon.\n\nBunny chows come in quarter, half and full loaves. When ordering a bunny chow in Durban, the local slang dictates that you need only ask for a \"quarter mutton\" (or flavour and size of your choice). Bunny chows are mainly eaten using the fingers; it is unusual to see locals use utensils when eating this dish. \n\nBunny chows were historically packaged in the previous day's newspaper. This is no longer common, and takeaway bunnies are more typically sold in \"bunny boxes\" which retain heat and prevent leaks from the curry.\n\nBunny chows are available in many small takeaways and Indian restaurants throughout South Africa. The price ranges from for a quarter beans or dhal, to for a quarter mutton bunny, and generally one can multiply the price of a quarter by between 3 and 4 to attain the price of a full bunny.\n\nEach year, the \"Bunny Chow Barometer\" is held in September on the south bank of the Umgeni River, just above Blue Lagoon (a popular Sunday picnic spot for Durban Indians), attracting numerous entrants from across the Durban Metro region to compete for the title of top bunny maker.\n\n"}

In 2013 she was awarded the inaugural Windham–Campbell Literature Prize for her fiction.\n\nZoë Wicomb was born near Vanrhynsdorp, Western Cape, in South Africa. Growing up in small-town Namaqualand, she went to Cape Town for high school, and attended the University of the Western Cape (which was established in 1960 as a university for \"Coloureds\").\n\nAfter graduating, she left South Africa in 1970 for England, where she continued her studies at Reading University. She lived in Nottingham and Glasgow and returned to South Africa in 1990, where she taught for three years in the department of English at the University of the Western Cape.\n\nSince 1994 she has lived in Glasgow, where she was, until her retirement in 2009, Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Strathclyde. She was Professor Extraordinaire at Stellenbosch University from 2005 to 2011. She is now Emeritus Professor at the University of Strathclyde.\n\nWicomb gained attention in South Africa and internationally with her first book, a collection of inter-related short stories, \"You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town\" (1987), set during the apartheid era and partly autobiographical, as the central character is a young woman brought up speaking English in an Afrikaans-speaking \"coloured\" community in Little Namaqualand, attending the University of the Western Cape, leaving for England, and authoring a collection of short stories. This work has been compared to V. S. Naipaul’s \"The Enigma of Arrival\".\n\nHer second work of fiction, the novel \"David's Story\" (2000), is set partly in 1991 toward the close of the apartheid era and explores the role of coloureds and women in the military wing of the ANC, and the challenges of adjustment to the realities of the \"New South Africa\". By presenting the novel as the work of an amanuensis creating a narrative out of the scattered statements of the central character, David Dirkse, Wicomb raises questions about the writing of history in a period of political instability, and by relating the stories of the Griqua people from whom Dirkse is, in part (like Wicomb), descended, it exposes the dangers of ethnic exclusiveness. The novel has been studied as a key work dealing with the transition period in South Africa along with \"Disgrace\", by J. M. Coetzee and \"Bitter Fruit\" by Achmat Dangor.\n\n\"Playing in the Light\", her second novel, released in 2006, is set in mid-1990s Cape Town and tells the story of Marion Campbell, the daughter of a coloured couple who succeeded in passing for white, as she comes to learn their painful story and to reassess her own place in the world of post-apartheid South Africa.\n\nWicomb's second collection of short stories, \"The One That Got Away\" (2008), is set mainly in Cape Town and Glasgow and explores a range of human relationships: marriage, friendships, family ties and relations with servants. Many of the stories—which are often linked to one another—deal with South Africans in Scotland or Scots in South Africa.\n\nHer third novel, \"October\", was published in 2015; its central character, Mercia Murray, returns from Glasgow to Namaqualand to visit her brother and his family and to face the question of what \"home\" means. The novel explicitly evokes its connection with Marilynne Robinson's \"Home\", the title Wicomb also wanted for her work.\n\nWicomb prefers nonprofit presses for her fiction, such as The Feminist Press and The New Press. Her short stories have been published in many collections, including \"\" (edited by Sarah Lefanu and Stephen Hayward; Lawrence & Wishart, 1990) and \"Daughters of Africa\" (edited by Margaret Busby; Jonathan Cape, 1992).\n\nWicomb has also published numerous articles of literary and cultural criticism; a selection of these has been collected in \"Race, Nation, Translation: South African essays, 1990-2013\" (edited by Andrew van der Vlies; Yale University Press, 2018). Her own fiction has been the subject of numerous essays, three special issues of journals (the \"Journal of Southern African Studies\", \"Current Writing\", and \"Safundi\" ) and a volume edited by Kai Easton and Derek Attridge, \"Zoë Wicomb & the Translocal: Scotland and South Africa\" (Routledge, 2017). She chaired the judges' panel for the 2015 Caine Prize for African Writing.\n\nHer work has been recognized for a number of prizes, including winning the M-Net Prize (for \"David’s Story\") in 2001, being shortlisted in 2009 for the Commonwealth Prize (for \"The One That Got Away\"), nominated for the Neustadt International Prize of Literature in 2012, and shortlisted for the Barry Ronge Fiction Prize (for \"October\") in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143286", "title": "Shot of Love", "text": "Shot of Love\n\n</ref\"></ref>\nShot of Love is the 21st studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on August 10, 1981, by Columbia Records. It is considered to be Dylan's last of a trilogy of Christian albums. Arrangements are rooted more in rock, and less in gospel than Dylan's two previous albums.\n\nAt the time of its release, \"Shot of Love\" received mixed reviews; Paul Nelson of \"Rolling Stone\" criticized the album, though he did single out the last track, \"Every Grain of Sand\", as a stand-out. \"Shot of Love\", while reaching UK No. 6, continued Dylan's US commercial decline, reaching No. 33 during a brief chart stay. Bono of Irish band U2 described \"Shot of Love\" as one of his favorites, particularly due to Dylan's singing ability.\n\nThroughout 1980, Dylan was still focused on religious-oriented music in what was dubbed his 'Born Again' period that was marked by prolific songwriting. It continued through the summer, when Dylan began work on his follow-up album to \"Saved\". \"Property of Jesus\", \"Yonder Comes Sin\", and new arrangements of older material like \"Ain't Gonna Go to Hell (For Anybody)\" were composed during this time, as were \"Caribbean Wind\" and \"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\", which \"contrast[ed] his troubled sexual relations with the demands of a higher calling\", according to Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin.\n\nThen, sometime in mid-September, Dylan reassembled his standing band at Rundown Studios in Santa Monica, California, where they recorded a number of his new songs, including \"Every Grain of Sand\". A rough recording of \"Every Grain of Sand\" dating from this period was eventually released on \"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991\".\n\nDylan embarked on a tour in November and December 1980, before returning to his songwriting. In March 1981, Dylan held more informal sessions at both Rundown and Studio 55, rehearsing some of his new compositions while auditioning a potential producer, Jimmy Iovine. These sessions focused on the song \"Caribbean Wind\", an ambitious work that had been performed live once during November. Already generating interest in the rock press, \"Caribbean Wind\" was seen as a potential centerpiece for his upcoming album, but it was not quite considered finished. Numerous attempts at recording \"Caribbean Wind\" during the Iovine sessions proved disappointing, with Dylan growing increasingly pessimistic about the song's prospects. \"Angelina\" was recorded with much greater success, and Dylan was satisfied enough to mark it for inclusion.\n\nIn the meantime, Dylan concluded that another producer was needed, but after relieving Iovine of his duties, Dylan struggled to find an appropriate producer, as well as an appropriate studio. Various sessions were booked across Los Angeles, including sessions at Cream Studios and United Western Studios. None of these places provided the sound Dylan had in mind but had difficulty creating. The sessions did provide an opportunity to rehearse new compositions, including \"In the Summertime\", as well as experiment with new ideas.\n\nDylan resigned himself to Rundown, where he and his band worked through his songs over a period of several weeks. Sometime in late April, veteran producer Bumps Blackwell stopped by to see Dylan. Blackwell was best known for producing Little Richard's most celebrated recordings, and though the purpose of his visit remains unclear, Blackwell ultimately produced that day's session, supervising recordings of \"Trouble\", \"Magic\" and \"Shot of Love\" that were later selected for the album. The experience gave Dylan an enormous amount of satisfaction, as he would later reveal in subsequent interviews, but Blackwell did not return for further work, possibly because of health issues.\n\nChuck Plotkin, who had experience working with Bruce Springsteen, was eventually hired by Dylan on the suggestion of a friend, Debbie Gold. Five sessions were scheduled for Plotkin's Clover Studio, beginning on April 27 and ending on May 1, and work proceeded on songs like \"Property of Jesus\", \"Watered-Down Love\", \"Heart of Mine\", \"Lenny Bruce\", \"Dead Man, Dead Man\", \"In the Summertime\", and \"Every Grain of Sand\", all of which received usable takes that were marked for the album. An extensively rewritten and rearranged version of \"Caribbean Wind\" was also recorded at Clover, but once again, Dylan was disappointed with the results; it was ultimately set aside for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nOn May 12, Dylan and Plotkin sequenced a preliminary version of \"Shot of Love\", but after listening to it the following day, Dylan decided to remove \"Angelina\" and \"Magic\" from the final sequence. The remaining nine songs were retained, but Dylan decided to re-record several of those songs. Three re-recordings were eventually used for the final sequence: \"Trouble\", \"Dead Man, Dead Man\", and \"Heart of Mine\", all of which were taped two to three days after the preliminary sequence was approved.\n\nThe mixing process proved rather tense as Plotkin and Dylan had conflicting ideas on how to mix the songs. Plotkin made numerous prototype mixes, delivering each one on cassette dub over to Dylan at Rundown Studios. Most, if not all of them, were rejected. \"Chuck [wanted] to get a nice mix at the end of each song\", recalls Jim Keltner, \"and Bob wouldn't have any of the nice mixes. Most everything you hear on that \"Shot of Love\" album turns out to be the monitor mixes.\" Plotkin spent another month mixing and overdubbing over the nine songs selected for \"Shot of Love\". Mixing was finally completed on June 7, with overdubbing continuing through June 16.\n\nUnlike Dylan's previous studio album \"Saved\", \"Shot of Love\" included more secular material as well as overtly religious and evangelistic songs.\n\nThe opening title track of \"Shot of Love\" makes a few spiritual references while railing against substance abuse.\n\n\"The purpose of music is to elevate and inspire the spirit\", Dylan said in a 1983 interview with \"NME\". \"To those who care where Bob Dylan is at, they should listen to \"Shot of Love\". It's my most perfect song. It defines where I am spiritually, musically, romantically and whatever else. It shows where my sympathies lie. It's all there in that one song.\" Produced by Bumps Blackwell, it's the only Blackwell production featured on \"Shot of Love\".\n\nThe second track on \"Shot of Love\" fits, again, somewhere between in secular and religious territory. A slight but jaunty, Tex-Mex number, \"Heart of Mine\" is a love song, Dylan's first in several years, but it is founded on Jeremiah 17:9, \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?\" Instead of singing to a person of interest, the narrator addresses his own \"heart\", trying to tame his own impulses and emotions in fear of getting hurt.\n\nAn earlier performance was already selected for use when Dylan decided to re-record \"Heart of Mine\" with Ronnie Wood and Ringo Starr. In an interview taken in 1984, Dylan admitted that \"Heart of Mine\" was \"done a bunch of different ways ... but I chose for some reason a particularly funky version of that—and it's really scattered. It's not as good as some of the other versions, but I chose it because Ringo and Ronnie Wood played on it, and we did it in like ten minutes.\" A live version from August 1981 is included on the \"Biograph\" compilation. The original version of \"Heart of Mine\" remains available only on bootlegs.\n\nContinuing the evangelism of \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Saved\", \"Property of Jesus\" is another one of Dylan's sharp put-down songs, this time aimed at non-believers who sneer at the Christian faithful.\n\nThe fourth track, \"Lenny Bruce\", is about the subversive Jewish comedian of that name. An influential entertainer whose use of provocative language led to a famous obscenity trial, Bruce died of a drug overdose in 1966. Despite the secular tone of the lyrics, the music is \"anchored in the resolute cadences of piano gospel\", according to music critic Tim Riley. Often regarded as a bizarre tribute, the song portrays Bruce as some kind of martyr, even though its characterizations of Bruce have been described as peculiar and almost non-descript. When Dave Herman asked why, after so many years, Dylan chose to write a song about Lenny Bruce (July 2, 1981 interview), he answered, \"You know, I have no idea! I wrote that song in five minutes! I found it was a little strange after he died, that people made such a hero out of him. When he was alive he couldn't even get a break. And certainly now, comedy is rank, dirty and vulgar and very unfunny and stupid, wishy-washy and the whole thing. ... But he was doing this same sort of thing many years ago and maybe some people aren't realizing that there was Lenny Bruce, who did this before and that is what happened to him. So these people can *do* what they're doing now. I don't know.\"\n\nThe first verse might, in fact, be seen to offer a subtle cut to Bruce's imitators for whom the use of profanity is a cheap \"shock\" gimmick, while for Bruce it was a strike for free speech: \"He was an outlaw, that's for sure/More of an outlaw than you ever were.\"\n\nWhen \"Shot of Love\" was reissued for compact disc, \"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\" was added into the album sequence. Recorded during the \"Shot of Love\" sessions, it was originally issued as a B-side to the 45rpm release of \"Heart of Mine\". Throughout the song, Dylan sings of a theological schism that ultimately separates the narrator and a woman, whom he addresses as 'Claudette.' The term 'groom' is used or implied in the Bible and in Christian theology. In this context, Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom to the Church, the Bride of Christ. Widely praised and heavily played on progressive radio, Riley called it \"a generous return to slow-burning defiance that restores not only the lust to Dylan's heart, but the power to his voice.\" Together with \"Caribbean Wind\" (an outtake discussed below), \"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\" marked a dramatic change in lyrical direction, one Dylan would continue to follow in his next album, \"Infidels\".\n\n\"Watered-Down Love\" is Dylan's version of 1 Corinthian's 13, describing \"love that's pure\", and lamenting that pure love is not what many people want.\n\nThe reggae-tinged \"Dead Man, Dead Man\" is another evangelical song. As Greil Marcus writes in \"Salon.com\", it \"is a textbook warning against the devil, if you listen as if you're reading; if you hear it, it's a poker game, and the singer's winning.\" But, actually, the song's theme is Romans 7:24 \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\", and \"dead man\" that Dylan is addressing is himself, admitting his moral fallibility and mocking his own appearance \"Satan's got you by the heel/There's a bird's nest in your hair.\"\n\nA song based in wistful retrospection, \"In the Summertime\" is perhaps the most relaxed, upbeat song on the entire album. Paul Nelson of \"Rolling Stone\" opined that \"In the Summertime\" has \"a lovely feel to it, and Dylan's harmonica playing hangs in the air like the scent of mimosa.\"\n\n\"Trouble\" is the quintessential blues song about how tribulation is intrinsic to human existence.\n\nIn recent years, some critics have grown to appreciate \"Shot of Love\" while others continue to disparage it. If there is any critical consensus, it's to be found on the closing track. Marked by an ethereal quality that is not found elsewhere on \"Shot of Love\", \"Every Grain of Sand\" is one Dylan's most celebrated recordings. In this song, Dylan puzzles over the dilemma of whether his disappointments, temptations, failings, and triumphs were due to his actions alone or ordained by God's delivering hand (\"I've gone from rags to riches in the sorrows of the night/In the violence of a summer's dream/In the chill of a winter light\" and \"I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea/Sometimes I turn and there's someone there; sometimes it's only me\").\n\nIt's \"perhaps his most sublime work to date\", writes Clinton Heylin, \"the summation of a number of attempts to express what the promise of redemption meant to him personally. One of his most intensely personal songs, it also remains one of his most universal. Detailing 'the time of my confession/the hour of my deepest need,' the song marks the conclusion of his evangelical period as a songwriter, something its position at the conclusion of \"Shot of Love\" tacitly acknowledges.\" Paul Nelson called it \"the 'Chimes of Freedom' and 'Mr. Tambourine Man' of Bob Dylan's Christian period ... it has surety and strength all down the line. Also vulnerability ... Dylan's beautifully idiosyncratic harmonica playing has metamorphosed into an archetype that pierces the heart and moistens the eye. And, for once, the lyrics don't let you down. The artist's Christianity is both palpable and comprehensible ... For a moment or two, he touches you, and the gates of heaven dissolve into a universality that has nothing to do with most of the LP.\"\n\nTim Riley described \"Every Grain of Sand\" as \"a prayer that inhabits the same intuitive zone as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" - you'd swear it was a hymn passed down through the ages.\" Rock critic Milo Miles wrote, \"This is the one Dylan song in ten years ... in which he examines a pop-culture paradox (that legendary stars in particular have to believe in ideals greater than themselves) more eloquently than any other performer has.\" When Bruce Springsteen inducted Dylan into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame on January 20, 1988, he would also cite \"Every Grain of Sand\" as an example of his best work.\n\nA number of critics had already turned on Dylan for the evangelism of his last two albums, but the reception for \"Shot of Love\" was particularly harsh. Despite lavishing praise on \"Every Grain of Sand\", Paul Nelson of \"Rolling Stone\" savaged the rest of the album. Nick Kent of \"New Musical Express\" called it \"Dylan's worst album to date.\" Despite heavy touring in Europe and North America (in which all but two songs were performed), sales of \"Shot of Love\" were below CBS's expectations. Still, in an interview taken in 1983, Dylan would describe \"Shot of Love\" as a personal favorite.\n\nReligion still held a strong place in Dylan's work, but as 1981 came to a close, his religious songs gave way to more secular material. During concerts in the summer of 1981, he covered Dave Mason's \"We Just Disagree\" and Dion's \"Abraham, Martin & John\". Some fans took the latter as a veiled ode to John Lennon, who was shot and killed the preceding winter, but in fact most of Dylan's performances of this song had been in the month immediately preceding Lennon's death, as a staple in the November–December 1980 US tour. Clinton Heylin notes, \"Dylan was audibly coming to the end of this particular road.\"\n\nThe year 1982 began with personal tragedy when Dylan's close and longtime friend Howard Alk was found dead at Rundown Studios on New Year's Day. His death was ruled a suicide. As Heylin reports, \"recent months had seen the deaths of guitarist Michael Bloomfield and fellow Christian musician Keith Green\", all of whom worked with Dylan, but Alk's death marked the end of an era. Dylan would soon dissolve his standing band, and he would not tour again until 1984. Sometime after June 1982, Dylan closed down Rundown Studios.\n\n\"Shot of Love\" was the last album issued under a contract signed with CBS in 1978, but despite the decline in his commercial standing, Dylan was re-signed to another contract (a five-year, five-album deal) in July 1982.\n\nMuch of 1982 was relatively quiet in terms of musical activity. An album of duets was recorded with his lover Clydie King at Gold Star Studios, but it would remain unreleased. At the time Dylan explained, \"it doesn't fall into any category that [CBS] knows how to deal with.\"\n\nHowever, the stage was set for his next album. Unlike his work on \"Shot of Love\", his next batch of songs would not be auditioned on stage. As Dylan completed his new songs in private, much time would be spent in Minneapolis catching up with his eldest, 16-year-old son, Jesse; this involved frequenting performances of new wave and punk acts like The Clash, Elvis Costello, Squeeze, and X.\n\n\n\nProduction\n"}

{"id": "2143320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143320", "title": "Mansouria, Tunisia", "text": "Mansouria, Tunisia\n\nEl-Mansuriya or Mansuriya (), near Kairouan, Tunisia, was the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate during the rule of the Ismaili Shia Muslim Imams al-Mansur Billah (r. 946–953) and al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (r. 953–975).\n\nBuilt between 946 and 972, el-Mansuriya was a walled city holding elaborate palaces surrounded by gardens, artificial pools and water channels. It was briefly the centre of a powerful state that encompassed most of North Africa and Sicily. It continued to serve as provincial capital of the Zirids until 1057, when it was destroyed by the invading Banu Hilal tribes. Any useful objects or relics were scavenged during the centuries that followed. Today, only faint traces remain.\n\nThe Fatimid Caliphate originated in an Ismaili Shia movement launched in Syria by Abd Allah al-Akbar. He claimed descent through Ismail, the seventh Shia imam, from the Islamic prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatimah. The Fatimid Dynasty is named after Fatimah. In 899 Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah became leader of the movement. He fled from his enemies to Sijilmasa in Morocco, where he proselytized under the guise of being a merchant. El-Mahdi was supported by a noble man named Abu Abdullah al-Shi'i, who organized a Berber uprising that overthrew the Tunisian Aghlabid dynasty, and then invited el-Mahdi to assume the position of imam and caliph. A new capital was established at Mahdia. The Fatimid Caliphate grew to include Sicily and to stretch across North Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to Libya.\n\nThe third Fatimid caliph in Ifriqiya was Abu Tahir Ismail el-Mansur Billah, an Ismaili Shia leader. He was invested as Imam on 12 April 946 in el-Mahdia, five weeks before his father died in great pain. He took the name \"el-Mansur\", \"the victor.\" At the time, el-Mahdia was under siege by the Kharidji rebel Abu Yazid. El-Mansur launched his campaign against Abu Yazid, and by August 946 had gained the upper hand in the battle for control of Kairouan. After his victory, he decided to found his new capital city at the site of his camp in the battle, just south of Kairouan. He laid out the plan immediately after the battle, in 946, although it would take another year of struggle before Abu Yazid was finally defeated.\n\nEl-Mansuriya was located less than south of the existing city of Kairouan.\nIt replaced el-Mahdia as the capital of the empire. El-Mansur moved to the new city in 948. The Kharijite rebels had destroyed the Aghlabid city of Raqqada, and building materials were taken from this old residence. The new city covered an area of about .\n\nThe city was circular, as was the original Baghdad, and the choice of layout may have been intended as a challenge to the Sunni Muslim Abbasid Caliphate based in Baghdad. The walls were twelve cubits wide, made of burned brick jointed with lime mortar. The space between the walls and the interior buildings was equal to the width of a highway.\n\nThe city included a congregational mosque. The caliph's palace was near the center of the city, which contained other palaces used for ceremonial, diplomatic and administrative purposes. The main palace was called \"Sabra\" (\"fortitude\"). The palace grounds covered an area of . The historian Ibn Hammad described the palace buildings as high and splendid structures surrounded by gardens and waters. They demonstrated the wealth and power of the caliph. The names give some hint of the nature of the palaces: the Camphor Audience Hall, the Chamber of the Diadem, the Fragrant Audience Hall and the Silver Chamber.\n\nEl-Mansuriya was completed under al-Muizz li-Din Allah, who ensured the water supply with the construction of an aqueduct. This aqueduct, in length, was based on a similar structure built by the Aghlabids. El-Muizz built a new canal on the aqueduct and added a extension to carry water to el-Mansuriya. El-Muizz also had a great hall built. Its massive columns, more than in diameter, were brought from Sousse, a day's march away. Construction of the city was not completed until 972, the year before el-Muizz moved to Egypt.\n\nThe city was primarily a royal residence. It contained palaces, gardens, a menagerie with lions, barracks and the royal stables. El-Mansur moved 14,000 Kutama families to the city and set up a souq, or marketplace. However, according to Ibn Muhadhdhab, \"el-Muizz commanded the merchants of Kairouan to come to their shops and workshops in el-Mansuriya in the mornings, and to return home to their families in the evenings.\" Tolls amounting to 26,000 silver dirhams were collected daily on goods entering the city through the four gates.\n\nIn its heyday, el-Mansuriya was the capital of a state that encompassed most of North Africa from Morocco to Libya, as well as Sicily, although it had to guard against attack from the Byzantine Empire and from King Otto I of Germany, both active in southern Italy. In 957, an embassy from Byzantium brought the tribute from the Emperor for his occupation of Calabria from there, with gifts of gold and silver vessels adorned with jewels, silks, brocades and other valuables. In Italy, El-Muizz planned the invasion of Egypt, whose conquest would make the Fatimids rivals in power to the Abbasids in Baghdad.\n\nThe Fatimid general, Jawhar, conquered Egypt in 969. He built a new palace city in Egypt, near Fustat, which he also called el-Mansuriya. When the imam arrived in 973, the name was changed to el-Qahra (Cairo). The new city was rectangular rather than round in plan. Both cities had mosques named el-Azhar after the prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima el-Azhar, and both had gates named Bab el-Futuh and Bab Zuwaila. Both cities had two palaces, for the caliph and for his heir, opposite each other.\n\nAfter the Fatimid caliphs moved to Egypt, el-Mansuriya remained the capital of the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside the city, a large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments. El-Muizz bin Badis, who ruled Ifriqiya under the Fatimids from 1015 to 1062, rebuilt the Kairouan city wall and built two walls on either side of the road from Kairouan to el-Mansuriya. He ordered the transfer to el-Mansuriya of the crafts and commerce from Kairouan.\n\nThe city faced attacks from Arab nomads from the Banu Hilal tribe. In 1057 the Zirids abandoned it for el-Mahdia, and it was never occupied again. Its building materials were later used by the inhabitants of Kairouan. As of 2009 the site of the city was a wasteland, crossed by many ditches, surrounded by the homes of poor people. Anything that could be reused for construction or other purposes has been scavenged during the centuries since it was abandoned. Stones, bricks, glass and metal were all removed. Little survived except fragments of unusable stucco.\n\nAerial surveys of the site have confirmed that there was a very large artificial enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are what is left of several circular and rectangular basins. The basins may be identified with the artificial pools described by the court poet Ali ibn Muhammad el-Iyadi, which surrounded the palace. The foundations have been revealed through archaeological excavations. Traces of the great hall's columns are still visible. Some parts of the canal can still be seen.\n\nA minor excavation was undertaken by George Marçais in the 1920s. Slimane Mostafa Zbiss conducted a more thorough excavation in the 1950s of the palace in the southeast quadrant of the city. Further excavations by a Franco-Tunisian team were made around the southeast palace in the late 1970s, ending in 1982. Few results have been published from these earlier excavations, and no records were made of the stratigraphic locations of the stucco fragments that were found.\n\nA more careful project was undertaken between 2003 and 2008, with more effort made to place the stucco fragments. There is evidence of multiple phases of occupation with different styles of decoration, including flower and leaf patterns, geometric patterns, animal and human figures and epigraphy. Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites. Evidence of cultural exchange with Egypt is less than might be expected, while the remains show a surprising amount of contact with al-Andalus, despite the continuous hostilities between the Fatimids and the Umayyads of the Iberian peninsula.\n\n"}

The performances on \"Real Live\" were recorded in support of his successful \"Infidels\" album. \n\nWhile \"Infidels\" was hailed as a \"return to musical form\" (as described by Kurt Loder in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine), critical reception for \"Real Live\" was generally mixed.

But 'Highway 61 Revisited' is well done as a rocker and 'Tombstone Blues' with Carlos Santana rolls along with great energy.\"\n\nIn \"Bob Dylan: The Complete Album Guide\", \"Rolling Stone\" panned \"Real Live\" but recognized the album's heavily-revised version of \"Tangled Up in Blue\" as a \"Forgotten Classic.\" The feature quoted Dylan as stating: \"On \"Real Live\", [\"Tangled Up in Blue\"]'s more like it should have been.

{"id": "2143338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143338", "title": "Empire Burlesque", "text": "Empire Burlesque\n\nEmpire Burlesque is the 23rd studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on June 10, 1985 on Columbia Records. Self-produced, the album peaked at in the U.S. and in the UK.\n\nAccompanied by multiple session musicians—including members of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench and Howie Epstein—the album has a distinct \"80s style\" aesthetic. Fans and critics continue to debate the album's merits, especially when compared to his 1960s and 1970s output.\n\nBefore embarking on a European tour in the summer of 1984, Dylan had spent a substantial amount of time recording demos of new songs in his Malibu home, accompanied at times by other musicians.\n\nIn rehearsals for the tour, Dylan attempted at least three of these new songs, and he occasionally found time to polish their lyrics during the tour.\n\nWhen the tour was over, Dylan returned to New York and began work on his next studio album. As Clinton Heylin reports, Dylan recorded in sporadic sessions, as had become his norm, rather than \"block-booking studio time\" and recording in one concentrated period. The result was \"an unprecedented expenditure of\" time for recording a Dylan album, from July 1984 to March 1985.\n\nTo accommodate the casual nature of this process, Dylan chose to produce the sessions himself.\nArthur Baker, who had previously worked with New Order and Afrika Bambaataa, was later recruited for these sessions, but much of the production work would actually be Dylan's.\n\nOne of his first decisions was to forgo the use of a stable set of musicians. Instead, Dylan recorded with an eclectic mix of studio professionals. An aborted session with Al Green's band was held at Intergalactic Studios on July 24, 1984. A session with Ronnie Wood (formerly of Faces and currently with The Rolling Stones), Anton Fig (best known as the drummer for David Letterman's house band), and John Paris was held at Delta Sound Studios on July 26.\n\nThe Delta session produced two notable tracks: “Driftin’ Too Far From Shore” and “Clean Cut Kid.” The former was set aside and would not be finished until 1986, when Dylan recorded his next album, \"Knocked Out Loaded\". The latter had originally been recorded during the \"Infidels\" sessions in 1983, but was not completed until now.\n\nWood later described his surprise at Dylan's lack of authority during the mixing process. \"[The engineers would] say, 'Hey Bob, we don't need this,' and he'd say, 'Oh, okay.' And they'd make a mix to their ears, and he'd just stand outside and let them do it. And I'd be saying, 'Hey! You can't let these guys...Look!! They've left off the background vocals!' or 'What about the drums?!' But there would be something going on in the back of his head which didn't allow him to interfere. And yet if he'd have gone into the control room with the dominance that he had while we were cutting the stuff, it could have been mind-bending.\"\n\nDuring one session between July and September 1984 (at the Power Station), Dylan demoed a song called \"Go 'Way Little Boy,\" with Ron Wood and \"cowpunk\" rockers Lone Justice. Dylan and Wood also played on Lone Justice's version of \"Go 'Way Little Boy,\" which was recorded at the same session and was ultimately released as a B-side to their single, “Sweet Sweet Baby (I’m Falling)”. A blues entitled \"Oh Baby\" was also recorded with the same lineup but has never surfaced.\n\nIn terms of his own album, the New York sessions had so far been fairly unproductive. After six months of work, Dylan had only a few recordings that were deemed acceptable, and only two would eventually appear on \"Empire Burlesque\". \"Sometimes nothing comes out, and other times I get a lot of stuff that I keep,\" Dylan said at the time. \"I just put down the songs that I felt as I wanted to put them down. Then I'd listen and decide if I liked them. And if I didn't like them I'd either rerecord them or change something about them.\" In November, Dylan returned to Los Angeles and began recording there.\n\nAn early session at Ocean Way Studios produced little if any work that was used for \"Empire Burlesque\". Much time was spent covering other artists’ songs, including “In The Summertime” by Ray Dorset (not to be confused with Dylan’s own song of the same name), “Freedom For The Stallion” by Allen Toussaint, and “Help Me Make It Through The Night” by Kris Kristofferson.\n\nWork became much more productive when Dylan continued work at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood. Recruiting Lone Justice drummer Don Heffington for the early December sessions, Dylan recorded an ambitious song he had co-written with playwright Sam Shepard, titled \"New Danville Girl\" and another song. Acceptable takes were recorded for both songs, though despite positive feedback from his peers, Dylan ultimately omitted \"New Danville Girl\" from \"Empire Burlesque.\"\n\nRegardless, he also found success on the next song, recorded at Cherokee on December 14. Benmont Tench, Mike Campbell, and Howie Epstein, from Tom Petty's Heartbreakers, joined Heffington for the session. \"Something's Burning, Baby\" would evolve into a key track on the album.\n\nOver the rest of the winter, Dylan recorded most of the tracks that were ultimately used for \"Empire Burlesque\". On January 28, 1985, another session at Cherokee produced the master take for “Seeing The Real You At Last.” This was followed by a brief stop at A&M Studios on the 28th and/or the 29th to record his contribution to “We Are the World.” On February 5, Dylan recorded master takes for two more tracks: “Trust Yourself” and “I’ll Remember You.” On the 14th—Valentine’s Day—Dylan recorded love songs, including Johnny Cash’s “Straight A’s In Love,\" but also one of his own, “Emotionally Yours.” With the exception of the “We Are the World” session, all of these songs were recorded with Heffington, the three Heartbreakers, and a few other session players at Cherokee Studios in Hollywood.\n\nBetween the 14th and the 19th of February, Dylan returned to New York City, resuming work at the Power Station. On the 19th, he held a session with Roy Bittan on piano and Steve Van Zandt on guitar, both members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. They recorded at least one usable take of \"When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky,\" but Bittan and Van Zandt would not return for the remainder of the sessions.\n\nThe following day, Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, better known as reggae recording artists Sly & Robbie, joined the sessions. They had previously worked with Dylan on \"Infidels.\" Along with female vocalists Queen Esther Marrow, Debra Byrd, and Carolyn Dennis, the group recorded “Never Gonna Be The Same Again.\"\n\nOn February 23, Dylan returned to the Power Station with Sly & Robbie, his back-up singers, and a number of session players, including Al Kooper, who filled in on guitar. The day’s work produced a significantly different version of “When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky,” which was ultimately chosen over the ‘Van Zandt version’ from a few days before.\n\nAround this time, Dylan also revived from the \"Infidels\" sessions \"Someone's Got A Hold Of My Heart.\" \"A song about being torn apart by irreconcilable demands,\" according to Clinton Heylin, in revision it was stripped of \"just about every religious allusion from the original.\" Dylan retitled it \"Tight Connection to My Heart\" and set it aside for further overdubbing.\n\nOne final song was recorded on March 3, a brand-new composition no more than a few days old. Recorded live-to-tape with no editing, overdubbing, or embellishment, “Dark Eyes” was also sequenced as the last song of the album.\n\nSome further overdubbing was scheduled, but with recording essentially finished, Arthur Baker was left to mix the album. \"I'm not too experienced at having records sound good,\" said Dylan. \"I don't know how to go about doing that. With Arthur Baker...I just went out and recorded a bunch of stuff all over the place, and then when it was time to put this record together, I brought it all to him and he made it sound like a record.\"\n\nThe opening track, \"Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)\", was originally recorded for 1983's \"Infidels\" under the title \"Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart\" (eventually released on \"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991\"). It was re-written and re-recorded several times before finding its way on to \"Empire Burlesque\". A lushly produced pop song riding a reggae groove courtesy of Robbie Shakespeare and Sly Dunbar (better known as Sly & Robbie), the love song was singled out as the best track on the album by the most recent edition of \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\". The track, which features Mick Taylor on guitar (from Dylan's 84 Tour), was also chosen as the first single for \"Empire Burlesque\".\n\nClinton Heylin describes \"Seeing the Real You at Last\" as \"a compendium of images half remembered from Hollywood movies,\" as many of the lyrics made \"allusions to Humphrey Bogart movies, \"Shane\", even Clint Eastwood's \"Bronco Billy\".\"\n\nThe love ballad, \"I'll Remember You\" was still played in concert until 2005, more so than all but one other song from \"Empire Burlesque\". It was also featured, in an acoustic version, in the movie \"Masked & Anonymous\", though not included on the released soundtrack.\n\n\"Clean-Cut Kid\" was another song recorded during the \"Infidels\" sessions. The lyrics weren't finished until much later, and the finished result was included on \"Empire Burlesque\". In the interim Bob gave the song to Carla Olson of the Textones as a thank you for her appearing in his first-ever video, Sweetheart Like You. She included it on the Textones' debut album Midnight Mission and Ry Cooder was featured on slide guitar. A novelty song wrapped around sharp political commentary, the 'clean-cut kid' is an average American kid who's radically altered by his experience in the Vietnam War. \"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau praised it as \"the toughest Vietnam-vet song yet.\"\n\nWhen members of the press, as well as Dylan's own fans, dubbed \"Empire Burlesque\" as 'Disco Dylan,' it was mainly for the song \"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky.\" An evocative song filled with apocalyptic imagery, it was originally an upbeat, piledriving rocker recorded with Steven Van Zandt and Roy Bittan, both members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. Unsatisfied with the recording, Dylan and Baker radically recast the song as a contemporary dance track. (The earlier version was later released on \"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991\".)\n\nThe penultimate song, \"Something's Burning, Baby\", is another song filled with apocalyptic imagery. A slow-building march accented with synthesizers, it was singled out by biographer Clinton Heylin as the strongest track on \"Empire Burlesque\": \"An ominous tale set to a slow march beat, [it] was a welcome reminder of his ongoing preoccupations with that dreadful day.\"\n\n\"Dark Eyes\" features only Dylan on guitar and harmonica. According to earlier interviews and Dylan's autobiography, Chronicles, it was written virtually on demand when Arthur Baker suggested something simpler for the album's final track. Dylan liked the idea of closing the album with a stark, acoustic track, particularly when the rest of the album was so heavily produced. However, Dylan didn't have an appropriate song. He returned to his hotel in Manhattan after midnight, and according to Dylan:\n\n\"As I stepped out of the elevator, a call girl was coming toward me in the hallway—pale yellow hair wearing a fox coat—high heeled shoes that could pierce your heart. She had blue circles around her eyes, black eyeliner, dark eyes. She looked like she'd been beaten up and was afraid that she'd get beat up again. In her hand, crimson purple wine in a glass. 'I'm just dying for a drink,' she said as she passed me in the hall. She had a beautifulness, but not for this kind of world.\"\n\nThe brief, chance encounter inspired Dylan to write \"Dark Eyes,\" which was quickly recorded without any studio embellishment. Structured like a children's song, with very rudimentary guitar work and very simple notes, it's often quoted for its last chorus: \"A million faces at my feet, but all I see are dark eyes.\"\n\nA number of critics have noted the bizarre sources of inspiration behind some of the songs. As mentioned, some lines were lifted from old Humphrey Bogart pictures, but at least a few were taken from the sci-fi television show, \"Star Trek\". Author Clinton Heylin wrote that \"one of the best couplets—\"I’ll go along with the charade / Until I can think my way out’ (from \"Tight Connection to My Heart\")—actually comes verbatim from a \"Star Trek\" episode, ‘Squire of Gothos’.\" Some then say this line was originally used in the Humphrey Bogart movie \"Sahara\", but it was not.\n\nOne of the most famous outtakes from the EB sessions is \"New Danville Girl.\" A satirical epic co-written with playwright Sam Shepard, it was originally an attempt at answering Lou Reed's song, \"Doin' the Things That We Want To\" from his 1984 album \"New Sensations\" (Reed was inspired to write \"Doin' the Things That We Want To\" after seeing one of Shepard's plays.)\n\n\"It has to do with a guy standing in line and waiting to see an old Gregory Peck movie (called \"The Gunfighter\") that he can't quite remember, only pieces of it,\" says Shepard. \"Then this whole memory thing happens, unfolding before his very eyes. He starts speaking internally to a woman...reliving the whole journey they'd gone on...We spent two days writing the lyrics, Bob had previously composed the melody line, which was already down on tape.\"\n\nAs Clinton Heylin notes, \"allowing each line to raise questions that lead the listener across the flatlands of Texas and time, Shepard contributes a conversational tone that hints at the very mundanity the song's characters are seeking to transcend.\"\n\nSession guitarist Ira Ingber recalls, \"When we first recorded '[New Danville Girl],' we...made a cassette. And he took it out and started playing it. He came back the next day we were working and said, 'Yeah, a lot of people like this thing.' And then he didn't do anything with it. It's like he was doing it to spite people who were all liking it, and he just held on to it.\"\n\n\"New Danville Girl\" would actually be re-written and re-recorded as \"Brownsville Girl\" for Dylan's next album, \"Knocked Out Loaded\".\n\nAnother outtake, \"Driftin' Too Far From Shore,\" was still unfinished when it was recorded in July 1984 at Delta Studios. The same recording would later be issued on \"Knocked Out Loaded\" after several major overdubs.\n\nIn addition to recording \"Go 'Way Little Boy\" during the Empire sessions, Dylan also recorded several other songs that did not make the final cut. He covered the 1950s classic \"Straight A's in Love.\" He recorded a song with two widely different lyrics. The first was entitled \"Waiting to Get Beat\". Using the same music, he wrote new lyrics, and recorded a second version entitled \"The Very Thought of You.\" Dylan also recorded a six-minute song entitled \"Who Loves You More\", which is a virtually finished take.\n\nThree takes of \"In the Summertime\" are circulating, as are two full takes of \"Freedom for the Stallion\" and also a brief take.\n\nAll the cut songs from Empire are circulating, including alternate takes to every song that made the album.\n\nDylan had numerous recordings from his Malibu recordings preceding his European tour in 1984. Though they were very informal, they were also used to demo songs and work out ideas that would later develop on \"Empire Burlesque\". One composition titled \"Angel of Rain (Almost Done)\" was composed at these sessions. There’s no documentation suggesting Dylan recorded this during the formal \"Empire Burlesque\" sessions, but it clearly held his interest during the rehearsals for the European tour. \"Angel of Rain\" made a deep impression on keyboardist Ian McLagan in what was supposed to be a rehearsal for previously released material. \"There was one beautiful song he played occasionally that he'd never recorded and never [fully] rehearsed with us either,\" recalls McLagan. \"It was a tricky little number, we never knew the title, but he'd launch into it from time to time, leaving us totally in the dark.\"\n\nIn 1991, one significant outtake from the \"Empire Burlesque\" sessions was released on \"The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991\". An early version of \"When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky,\" recorded on February 19, 1985, it featured Roy Bittan on piano and Steve Van Zandt on guitar; both men were better known as members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. \"The Van Zandt 'When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky,' [an] apocalyptic vision bristling with drama, sung without restraint, could have provided Dylan with another epic to counterbalance the mawkish filler he'd been recording since 'New Danville Girl',\" writes Heylin. \"Instead, Dylan again second-guessed some of his better lines...and absolutely one of his best vocals from a fraught decade, rerecording the song...with a whomping synthesizer and horns track...\" Music critic Tim Riley argued, \"the alternate take...has such an undeniably raunchy attitude (and guitar solo by Miami Steve Van Zandt) you wonder why Dylan stuck with the lifeless take that makes \"Empire Burlesque\" drift off on side two.\"\nThe title of the album, Empire Burlesque, probably refers to a theater in Newark, NJ, where strippers and comedians entertained (Phiip Roth mentions it in Portnoy's Complaint). If Dylan was inspired, it remains to be discovered. It might have been a stop on his way to visit Woody Guthrie in Greystone Park.\n\nUpon its release, \"Empire Burlesque\" received generally positive reviews, most notably a full-page review in \"Time\" magazine, but a number of critics demurred on the production, reservations that presaged \"Empire Burlesque\"'s poor reputation in later years.\n\nMembers of the press claimed Dylan was trying to achieve a then-contemporary sound on \"Empire Burlesque\"; Dylan jokingly replied that he didn't know anything about new music, adding \"I still listen to Charley Patton.\"\n\nIn his \"Consumer Guide\" column for \"The Village Voice\", critic Robert Christgau wrote, \"At best [Dylan]'s achieved the professionalism he's always claimed as his goal...he's certainly talented enough to come up with a good bunch of songs. Hence, his best album since \"Blood on the Tracks\". I wish that was a bigger compliment.\"\n\nAs promotion for \"Empire Burlesque\", music videos for \"Tight Connection to My Heart,\" \"When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky,\" and \"Emotionally Yours\" were produced and broadcast on MTV, with Paul Schrader (best known for his work with Martin Scorsese) directing the video for \"Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)\". However, album sales remained fairly modest.\n\nTrack numbering refers to CD and digital releases of the album.\n\n"}

However, the 11-minute epic \"Brownsville Girl\", co-written by Sam Shepard, has been cited as one of his best songs by some critics. Sales for \"Knocked Out Loaded\" were weak, as it peaked at on U.S. charts and in the UK.\n\nThe album includes three cover songs, three collaborations with other songwriters, and two solo compositions by Dylan. Most of the album was recorded in the spring of 1986, although recording or mixing work on one track, \"Got My Mind Made Up\", reportedly occurred in June. Several tracks from the album used overdubbing to build on instrumental tracks from 1984 and 1985 sessions.\n\nOne song, \"Maybe Someday\", paraphrases a line from T. S. Eliot's poem \"Journey of the Magi\": Eliot's \"And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly\" becomes in Dylan \"Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns\".\n\nThe cover art is a reworking of the January 1939 cover of Spicy Adventure Stories.\n\nThe album earned mostly negative reactions, with only a rewritten version of an outtake (\"New Danville Girl'\", retitled \"Brownsville Girl\") recorded during the \"Empire Burlesque\" sessions, receiving uniform praise. Robert Christgau called it \"one of the greatest and most ridiculous of [Dylan's] great ridiculous epics.\"\n\n\"\"Knocked Out Loaded\" is ultimately a depressing affair,\" wrote Anthony DeCurtis in his review published in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, \"because its slipshod, patchwork nature suggests that Dylan released this LP not because he had anything in particular to say, but to cash in on his 1986 tour. Even worse, it suggests Dylan's utter lack of artistic direction.\" In the Howard Sounes book \"Down The Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan\", it is reported that Dylan said \"if the records I'm making only sell a certain amount anyway, then why should I take so long putting them together?\"\n\nDylan has played few songs from this album in concert; \"Driftin' Too Far From Shore\", with 14 performances (all but one in 1988), is the most frequently performed. Four songs remain unplayed, while the other three have together been aired only five times.\n\nIn recent years the album has gained a cult following among some Dylan fans who believe it is one of his least-understood works, but critical consensus remains negative, with recent reviews from Salon.com to \"Rolling Stone\" calling it a \"career-killer\" and \"the absolute bottom of the Dylan barrel\" respectively.\n\nThe album was remastered and re-issued in 2013 as a part of \"The Complete Albums Collection, Vol. One\" box set.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2143356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143356", "title": "Colkirk", "text": "Colkirk\n\nColkirk is a village (population 2001-547) situated about two miles south of Fakenham in the county of Norfolk, England. Dating from at least the time of the Domesday Book. The village including Oxwick , Pattesley and South Raynham currently (2011) has 588 inhabitants living in 266 dwellings. The village has a church, (St. Mary's), in the north west corner of the village, a Village Hall, a church pond (known as the Church Pit in Norfolk dialect), a Camping Land (land once used for the game Camping, \"camp\" meaning battle in Old English). There is also a thriving village school for students from the age of four to eleven, a lively village Pub called \"The Crown\" and a playing field for soccer, cricket, rounders and school sports days.\n\nThe village lies close to the source of the River Wensum which is between Colkirk, Oxwick and Whissonsett.\n\nThe name Colkirk is an Anglo-Saxon or Danish word, meaning \"the church of Cola\", from \"kirk\" meaning church and \"Cola\" being the name of the builder or first owner of a church perhaps over a thousand years ago. The present church may possibly be on the same site as the original building and is of medieval origin.\n\nAt the time of the Domesday Book, the whole estate of the manor of Colkirk belonged to the bishop. At that time the cathedral was at North Elmham and the Domesday Book records how much land the bishop held in Colkirk, how many sheep and pigs he kept and how many people worked on his estate.\n\nDetails of the original moated manor house and buildings, which included a dovecote and private chapel and was situated near Long's Lane off Dereham Road, were described in a document of 1296.\n\nSoon after the cathedral was established in Norwich in 1101, the Bishop gave Colkirk to one of the knights of his private army. This knight named himself after the village \"Richard of Colkirk\" and he and his successors lived at the manor house until 600 years ago, after which the house within the moat was allowed to fall into decay.\n\nAbout 400 years ago in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the village began to look more like the Colkirk of today. Brick and flint started to replace timber framed wattle and clay as building materials. Some of the earliest brick and flint houses remain today, \"Starre\" and \"Gable End\" being among the oldest houses in the village and Colkirk Hall was built towards the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I around 1595. The Timperley family were one of the first recorded occupants of the Hall. The Timperley family, after whom the Timperley Estate was named, fell on hard times and lost most of their land as a penalty for helping to defend King's Lynn against Oliver Cromwell's troops in 1643. Colkirk Hall was subsequently bought by Marquis Townshend, since when it has been occupied as a farm house.\n\nOther changes were taking place in Colkirk at this time. One by one the small farmers who comprised the village population were becoming poor and sold their land to richer men. In this way there came to be just a few big farms in the village as there are today. With the formation of the big farms came the division of the old, big village fields into the smaller fields, bounded by hedges, which still exist today. All the land in the Parish was finally brought into use when the commons were enclosed and the big woods cut down about 150 years ago.\n\nThe period 1820 to 1845 saw a population increase in the village and a number of houses were built or rebuilt about this time. These houses can be recognised as they were generally of red brick, rather than flint. The \"Crown\" was rebuilt by the Parish in 1827 and Colkirk House was built in 1837.\n\nSince then, most of the houses on the right hand side of School Road were built as model cottages, by Canon Hoare, when he was Rector of Colkirk. The School was rebuilt in 1851 and the Infants' Room added in 1894. A Chapel was established in the village in the 1830s; however, the building erected in 1875 has now been demolished.\n\nThere was a Co-op in the village founded 120 years ago, having occupied three different sites in its time and finally situated in Dereham Road was closed in the 1960s.\n\nOther facilities, which were once part of village life and have passed into history, include a Pork Butcher's Shop, a General Store and a Carpenter and Undertaker, all on Hall Lane, together with a Blacksmith and a Baker's Shop on Dereham Road. The last to be closed being the Village Shop and Post Office which was on the junction of Dereham Road and Crown Road.\n\nThe Village Hall was built some 140 years ago by one of the Rectors of Colkirk and is now owned by the Parish.\n\nCensus population figures for the village show little change during the latter part of the 19th century and at around 450 are about 100 fewer than the present day.\n\nIn the 1883 Kelly's Directory described the village thus:\nCOLKIRK is a parish about two miles south from Fakenham, in the Western division of the county, Launditch hundred, union of Mitford and Launditch, county court district of East Dereham, rural deanery of Toftrees and archdeaconry and diocese of Norwich: the village is situated on a height, commanding a fine prospect. The church of St. Mary the Virgin is a small plain Gothic building of flint consisting of chancel, nave and north aisle, and tower with 5 bells, and contains memorials to the Timperley and other families: there are several stained windows. The register dates from the year 1538. The living is a rectory, consolidated with Oxwick, joint yearly value £800, with residence, in the gift of and held since 1868 by the Rev. Walter Marsham Hoare M.A. of Exeter College, Oxford. The charities amount to £30 yearly, principally for fuel. The Marquis Townshend is lord of the manor and principal landowner. The soil is mixed; subsoil, clay. The chief crops are wheat, turnips and barley. The area is 1,482 acres (6 km); rateable value, £2,508; and the population in 1881 was 431.\n\nThe following people are listed as tradespersons in the village:<br>\n\nPARISH CLERK – Mr William Smith<br>\n\nPOST OFFICE – Mr William Thompson<br>\n\nNATIONAL SCHOOL – Miss H.

In 1969, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. In 1972, she obtained a Juris Doctor from the Tulane University Law School in New Orleans. From 1973 to 1975, she clerked for Judge Herbert W. Christenberry at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana (1973–1975), after which she worked as a maritime attorney in private practice in New Orleans until 1991.\n\nOn October 1, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Clement to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, also in New Orleans. She was confirmed by the Senate to this post on November 21, 1991 by a vote of 99–0, and received commission on November 25, 1991. In 2001 she served as chief judge of this court, before being nominated to the Fifth Circuit.\n\nClement was nominated on September 4, 2001 by President George W. Bush to fill a seat vacated by Judge John Malcolm Duhé Jr., who had assumed Senior status. President Bill Clinton in 1999 had nominated Louisiana lawyer H. Alston Johnson III to the seat on the Fifth Circuit created by Duhé's vacancy, but the United States Senate never held a hearing or took a vote on Johnson's nomination. Clement was confirmed by the Senate on November 13, 2001 by a vote of 99–0, and received her commission on November 26, 2001. She was the first judge Bush appointed to the Fifth Circuit who was confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIn September 2017, Judge Clement stated that she would take senior status upon the confirmation of her successor. She assumed senior status on May 14, 2018, after her successor, Kurt D. Engelhardt, was confirmed.\n\nShe criticized her liberal colleagues James L. Dennis and Gregg Costa in a dissent on March 22, 2019, regarding a racist gerrymandering case. She said that the plaintiffs only won because the panel happened to have 2 liberal Democratic appointees on it. Clement also slammed a \"majority-minority panel\", suggesting that the 5th Circuit's conservative majority would reverse the holding if en banc were granted.\n\nClement has a reputation as a conservative jurist and a strict constructionist who strongly supports principles of federalism. She has written few high-profile opinions.\n\nShe wrote for the majority in \"Vogler v. Blackmore\", reducing pain and suffering damages awarded by a jury to a mother and daughter who were killed in a car accident. The basis of her ruling was the lack of specific evidence about the daughter's \"awareness of the impending collision.\" Large damage awards to the father and husband due to the loss of society in his wife and daughter were affirmed.\n\nIn \"Chiu v. Plano Independent School District\", Clement held that a school district's policy requiring the preapproval of fliers handed out at a school event violated the First Amendment free speech rights of would-be protestors.\n\nIn \"United States v. Harris\", Clement again wrote for the majority, this time reinstating the sentence of a police captain convicted for violation of federal civil rights laws in using excessive force. The captain moved to vacate, arguing that his counsel had been insufficient. Clement and the court held that the representation had been reasonable.\n\nClement wrote a unanimous opinion for the 5th Circuit in \"Tarver v. City of Edna\". She upheld officers' appeal of qualified immunity for reasonably arresting a father who was interfering with the return of a child to its rightful custodian. Qualified immunity also protected officers from the plaintiff's accusation of excessive force in using handcuffs and confining him to the police car as part of the arrest. Officers also, however, slammed the car door on his foot and head, and the plaintiff's excessive force claim under this heading was remanded.\n\nClement has joined other conservative judges in dissenting in Commerce Clause cases that implicate federalism. In \"U.S. v. McFarland\", she argued that the Commerce Clause power did not enable Congress to regulate local robberies. In \"GDF Realty Investments, Ltd. v. Norton\" Clement argued that the Endangered Species Act needed a commercial nexus to enable regulation of endemic rare species.\n\nIn 2010, Clement joined Judges Garza and Owen in affirming the dismissal of the complaint in Doe v. Silsbee Independent School District. The plaintiff (\"H.S.\") was a cheerleader who was ordered by her high school to cheer for her sexual assaulter, a basketball player named Rakheem Bolton. H.S. refused and was kicked off the team. She sued, claiming a violation of her First Amendment right to free speech. The Eastern District of Texas, Judge Thad Heartfield, granted the school district's motion to dismiss, and Judges Clement, Garza, and Owen affirmed. H.S. was ordered to pay the school $45,000 in legal fees for filing a \"frivolous\" lawsuit.\n\nJust prior to the nomination of John G. Roberts in the summer of 2005 to replace retiring justice Sandra Day O'Connor, it was widely circulated in the press that Clement would receive the nomination. Following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and the changing of John G. Roberts' nomination from Associate Justice to Chief Justice by President Bush, the media mentioned Clement again as a possible choice to fill the vacant Associate Justice seat. Much of this speculation was because Clement is a conservative woman with a limited paper trail on controversial issues. Eventually, George W. Bush chose White House Counsel Harriet Miers as his nominee to succeed O'Connor, but with the withdrawal of Miers's nomination, Clement again was thought to be a potential nominee until the nomination of federal judge Samuel Alito, who was ultimately confirmed.\n\n\n"}

Ryton is located within Gateshead's Green Belt which mainly contains areas west and southwest of Gateshead Town because the area of South Tyneside to the east is largely urbanised.\n\nTraditionally, Ryton's economy was built upon agriculture and coal mining. Some think that coal mining was taking place in the area as early as Roman times, however it was not until 1239 when Henry III granted that coal could be mined outside the walls that mining became extensive. There are records of coal being shipped from Winlaton to London as early as 1367. The agricultural industry in Ryton was mixed and included both pastoral farming and arable farming.\n\nRyton's position south of the Scottish Borders and Hadrian's Wall made it a target for Scottish attacks in the area, and it is said to have been burned by William Wallace in 1297. A further attack by David II of Scotland was recorded in 1346, during which the church was plundered.\n\nAs well as its coal industry, Ryton formerly contained the lead-smelting reverberatory furnaces of the \"Ryton Company\", whose mines were on Alston Moor. By 1704, this business had been amalgamated into the London Lead Company.\n\nIn 1800 the Stargate Pit (Towneley Main Colliery) was opened and on 30 May 1826, a coal dust and methane (firedamp) explosion there killed 20 men and 18 boys. This became known as the \"Stargate Pit Disaster\". There is a memorial marker at Ryton's Holy Cross Church, and another memorial stone at the pit itself. The Stargate Pit was reopened in 1840 and not closed until 1961.\n\nRyton soon became a place of migration for the wealthy, who wanted to escape the urban sprawl of the Industrial Revolution in Gateshead and Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. A reminder of Ryton's affluent past is found in some of the large mansions at Old Ryton Village, a place rich in rural qualities because of its proximity to Ryton Willows on the banks of the River Tyne. The most notable mansion in the village is The Grove, formerly known as Ryton Grove, a 12,000 sq ft brick building in the symmetrical Queen Anne style, believed to have been constructed for the Surtees family in 1742, and later substantially extended and remodelled in 1919. This was originally at the centre of a 350-acre estate that encompassed many houses within Ryton Village and much of Ryton Willows down to the banks of the river Tyne, including a large lake that was later divided in to two by a railway embankment. A large part of the estate became a nature reserve in 1964, with The Grove remaining in private ownership standing in 7 acres.\n\nAfter the decline of the coal industry during the second half of the twentieth century Ryton became increasingly suburbanised and is now used as a commuter village for those that work in the more urban areas of Tyneside.\n\nIn local government, Ryton is located in the Ryton, Crookhill and Stella ward, which is in the outer west of the borough. The ward is served by three councillors, who represent Labour. Gateshead Council is Labour controlled.\n\nRyton is located within the parliamentary constituency of Blaydon. Its current MP is Labour's Liz Twist.\n\nThe neighbouring village of Crawcrook is a nexus of coal mining nostalgia also. Remnants of several old pits across Ryton and Crawcrook, including Emma, Clara and Addison can still be found. Within a couple of hundred metres of both Crawcrook and Ryton main street there is rich countryside.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive section of this countryside is Ryton Willows Local Nature Reserve located on the banks of the Tyne, just past Old Ryton Village. It consists of 43 hectares of grassland, ponds, woodland and locally rare species of flora and fauna. Because of this it has been designated as a site of special scientific interest.\n\nOther areas of countryside include nearby Stargate pond and Addison and Hedgefield woods. It is at Addison woods that Alexander Graham Bell made one of his pioneering telephone calls.\n\nFurther up the Tyne Valley, past the village of Crawcrook and into the border of Northumberland, there are rural market towns such as Prudhoe, Corbridge and Hexham.\n\nA relatively affluent area of Gateshead, Ryton has experienced suburbanisation in recent years and is now used as a commuter area for those that work in the more urban areas of Tyneside.\n\nDespite being a provincial suburb, Ryton remains a vibrant area, with a variety of local amenities. In the more central part of Ryton these include a Cooperative supermarket, a Sainsbury's Local store and a selection of independent businesses and shops such as ,\n\nThe Lane Head micro pub, Coffee Johnny's, a dentist and various hair and beauty salons. The former Ryton Hotel public house has closed and been converted in to three shops, currently to let. There is also a community library. North East Falconry is based in Ryton with over 45 birds of prey. Ryton also boasts several restaurants and public houses, two of which are located away from Ryton Main Street, in Ryton Old Village, the community owned Ye Olde Cross and the Half Moon Inn and restaurant. The nearby village of Crawcrook offers more services, including a doctor's surgery, two veterinary surgeries, a chiropodist, another dentist, 3 pubs and a restaurant.\n\nRyton also has an extensive Edwardian park which includes children's playing equipment, a bowling green.\n\nAway from the town centre there are two golf courses, Tyneside golf club at Ryton, and Ryton golf club in nearby Clara Vale. Both are situated in tranquil areas, near the banks of the Tyne.\n\nRyton is home to three schools, Ryton Infants School, Ryton Junior School and Thorp Academy, all of which occupy the same site in the town. Nearby Crawcrook offers two more primary schools. Crookhill Primary is also nearby.\n\nSport also plays a role in the local community. Apart from its golf facilities and its Edwardian park, Ryton has its own football club, Ryton F.C., who play at Crawcrook, its own rugby union team, Ryton Rugby Football Club at nearby Barmoor. Ryton also has its own cricket club, situated opposite Charles Thorp.\n\nRyton also benefits from good public transport with regular bus services. The R3/R4 which regularly travels to Winlaton, Blaydon and Rowlands Gill via Stargate is a good example of this excellent transport. Buses also travel to Crawcrook, Prudhoe and Hexham to the west, and the MetroCentre, Gateshead and Newcastle to the east.\n\nBoth John Wesley and Charles Wesley preached at Ryton's village green, which has a rich history with religious and social significance. Like many greens in similar villages, it played host to an annual fair which included jugglers, dancers and local stalls.\n\nThe old pinfold dates back to the twelfth century. During the second half of the twentieth century the pinfold was restored.\n\nCharles Thorp set up a savings bank in 1815 in a building within the old village known as the White House which still stands there today. It is thought to have been the first bank of its kind in England.\n\nThe annual Ryton Music Festival, held over February and March, has been held in the village for more than 60 years. It offers a variety of music and drama including choral singing and mime.\nThe Ryton Summer Festival, held at the local comprehensive school usually includes live music, sport and arts and crafts stalls.\n\nEach year on the Tuesday before Christmas Eve villagers gather on the village green to sing traditional carols accompanied by a local brass band.\n\nThere are two air raid shelters in Ryton Willows, as well as other Second World War features such trenches and shower/toilet rooms with tiles, etc. still visible, next to a railway line that was apparently used to bring children up from London. A dirt road hidden under trees leading up to the bottom of the village may have been a checkpoint.\n\n\n"}

He was of an old Saxon noble family. His older half-brother was Eduard von Feuchtersleben (1798–1857), son of Ernst von Feuchtersleben from his first marriage.\n\nHe attended the Theresian Academy in his native city, and in 1825 entered its university as a student of medicine. In 1833 he obtained the degree of doctor of medicine and settled in Vienna as a practicing surgeon. In 1834 he married. The young doctor kept up his connection with the university, where he lectured, and in 1844 was appointed dean of the faculty of medicine.\n\nHe cultivated the acquaintance of Franz Grillparzer, Heinrich Laube, and other intellectuals in Vienna. He interested himself greatly in educational matters, and in 1848, while refusing the presidency of the ministry of education, accepted the appointment of under secretary of state in that department. In this capacity he attempted to introduce some important reforms in the system of education, but, discouraged by the difficulties which he encountered, he resigned in December of the following year. His health gave way, and he died at Vienna on 3 September 1849.\n\nHis family now lives in Melbourne, Australia\n\nAmong his medical works were \"Über das hippokratische erste Buch von der Diät\" (Vienna, 1835) and \"Lehrbuch der ärztlichen Seelenkunde\" (1845). The latter was translated into English two years later as 'The Principles of Medical Psychology'. It is often credited as a first notable use of the term psychopathy, used with a broad meaning more accurate to its etymological literal sense (mental disorder) than today's usage. It has also often been credited with the coining of the term psychosis, which at that time had a similarly broad meaning to psychopathy, but this has since been traced back to Karl Friedrich Canstatt's Handbuch der Medicinischen Klinik (1841).\n\nHis poetical works include \"Gedichte\" (Stutt. 1836), among which is the well-known beautiful hymn, which Mendelssohn set to music, \"Es ist bestimmt in Gottes Rat\". As a philosopher he is best known by his \"Zur Diätetik der Seele\" (\"Dietetics of the soul\") (Vienna, 1838), which attained great popularity, and the tendency of which, in contrast to Hufeland's \"Makrobiotik\" (\"On the Art of Prolonging Life\"), is to show the true way of rendering life harmonious and lovely. This work had by 1906 gone into fifty editions. Noteworthy also is his \"Beiträge zur Literatur-, Kunst- und Lebenstheorie\" (Vienna, 1837-1841), and an anthology, \"Geist der deutschen Klassiker\" (Vienna, 1851; 3rd ed. 1865-1866). His collected works (with the exception of the purely medical ones) were published in 7 vols. by Fr. Hebbel (Vienna, 1851-1853). See M. Necker, \"Ernst von Feuchtersleben, der Freund Grillparzers,\" in the \"Jahrbuch der Grillparzer Gesellschaft\", vol. iii (Vienna, 1893).

After attending Nottingham High School, Adam read history at St John's College, Cambridge and graduated with a first Class degree. While at St John's he was both President of the Union and President of the University Liberal Club. After graduating, he joined the staff of the \"Manchester Guardian\" newspaper as a journalist at the age of just twenty-two. While working for the \"Guardian\" he also began working as a freelance broadcaster for BBC radio in Manchester, leaving the newspaper to join the BBC full-time in 1934 as a Home News Editor.\n\nAdam stayed in radio for just two years before returning to the world of print journalism, joining \"The Star\" in 1936. He worked for the paper as a special correspondent until 1940, when due to the journalistic restrictions of the Second World War he temporarily left the industry to become the press officer for the British Overseas Airways Corporation. His time at BOAC was short-lived, however, as in 1941 he re-joined the staff of the BBC, this time serving as its Head of Publicity.\n\nAdam spent nine years in this role, before in 1950 the Director General of the BBC, William Haley, took the perhaps surprising decision to appoint him as the Controller of the BBC Light Programme, one of the BBC's most popular national radio stations. Adam took up the post at the end of the year and successfully ran the station for the next four years, although he apparently became frustrated at the lack of opportunities to move across into the newer medium of television, which was his latest ambition.\n\nPerhaps due to this frustration, in 1955 he once more decided to leave the BBC, and indeed the full-time broadcasting industry as a whole, joining Hulton Press as the company's Joint General Manager. This finally enabled him to make the move in television with the BBC's commercial competitor, ITV, as he returned to appearing on the airwaves rather than behind the scenes, becoming a chairman of the programme \"Free Speech\". He also appeared occasionally on other television programmes, as well as on various BBC radio programmes. In February 1957 he returned once again to the BBC to succeed Cecil McGivern as the Controller of Programmes at the BBC Television Service. He occupied this post for four years until 1961, when he was promoted to become the BBC's overall Director of Television. He remained in this role until 1968, when he reached the BBC's compulsory retirement age of sixty. \n\nFollowing his retirement he often lectured on broadcasting matters at seminars in the United States, being made Visiting Professor of Communications at Temple University, Philadelphia. He also wrote a frank series of articles on his time at the BBC for the \"Sunday Times\" newspaper in 1969, and in later years was variously a Governor of Charing Cross Hospital; of the British Film Institute; a member of the councils of the National Youth Theatre; the Tavistock Institute; the British Travel Association and Industrial Design. In 1962 he had been awarded the CBE, and he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.\n\nHe was married to his wife, Ruth, from 1932 to her death in 1977. They had three sons and a daughter, the journalist Corinna Adam (later Ascherson), all of whom survived him.\n"}

{"id": "2143431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143431", "title": "Defect detector", "text": "Defect detector\n\nA defect detector is a device used on railroads to detect axle and signal problems in passing trains. The detectors are normally integrated into the tracks and often include sensors to detect several different kinds of problems that could occur. Defect detectors were one invention which enabled American railroads to eliminate the caboose at the rear of the train, as well as various station agents stationed along the route to detect unsafe conditions. The use of defect detectors has since spread to other overseas railroads.\n\nBefore the advent of automated detectors, on-board train crew and track-side workers used to visually inspect trains for defects e.g. \"hotboxes\" (overheating bearings) would smoke or glow red. By the 1940s, automatic defect detectors included infrared sensors for hotboxes, wires outlining the clearance envelope to detect high and wide loads, and \"brittle bars\"frangible bars mounted between the railsto detect dragging equipment. The detectors would transmit their data via wired links to remote read-outs in stations, offices or interlocking towers, where a stylus-and-cylinder gauge would record a reading for every axle; a defect would register a sharp spike on the graph and an alarm would sound or a visible signal would be given to the train crew.\n\nThe first computerized detectors had lights indicating the nature of defect and a numeric display of the associated axle number.\n\nSeaboard Air Line was the first railroad to install defect detectors which \"spoke\" their results over radios carried by train crew. Later models allowed crews to interact with the detector using a touch tone function on their radios to recall the defect report. Today, defect detectors are typically part of the general monitoring platforms keeping track of train status.\nA Defect Detector Would Sound Like This: (This was the read out of the Campville Defect Detector, located at Campville, Florida on the CSX Wildwood Subdivision, on April 6th, 2019.)\nCSX Equipment Defect Detector. Milepost 700.1. No Defects. No Defects. Total Axles 738. Train length 13764. Speed 45. End of Transmission\n\nThe sensors installed at defect detector locations can include and are explained:\nHot boxes or Hot Bearing Detectors are used to measure the temperature of the journal bearings of a train. They typically consist of two infrared eyes on each side of the tracks looking up at the train's bearings. They register the radiation from every journal that passes over them. If a bearing reaches the maximum temperature for safe travel, the detector will flag and count it as a defect.\n\nA column of cones sits across the whole width of the railroad (just like a cross tie) attached to a switch. Anything dragging from the train will hit this cone, thus pushing it back, thus breaking a contact. It then returns to its normal position to prepare for anything else that might be dragging under the train. The detector will register this action and flag it as a defect. Brittle bars are still used elsewhere, but still have to be repaired. Over time, dragging equipment detector's metal flaps need to be replaced because of extensive damage to them. \nSingle use systems typically involve a frangible engagement bar or a stainless steel wire/braid strung between the rails and typically outside the rails as well, fastened to the sleepers. If the bar or braid is hit by something it breaks, and the circuit break alerts that there is a dragging item. \nAuto-resetting systems typically involve a pivot pin system to allow the target to reset itself after a hit.\n\nInfrared beams are placed horizontally above the track (high car) or vertically next to the track (shifted load). Anything that breaks the beam will be counted as a defect. A high car detector is placed anywhere an excess height car could be routed onto a low clearance line. A shifted load detector is mainly found on railroads where double-stack trains are prevalent as the containers may become misaligned and present a hazard to bridge trusses or tunnel walls.\n\nWheel sensors along the tracks feel for flat spots on the train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too dangerous to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilize accelerometers, strain gauges, fiber optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) wheel impact phase detector. A wheel impact load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalize these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are measuring wheel defect impact rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.\nA wheel condition monitoring detector monitors the condition of the wheel independent of sprung mass – independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalized impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.\n\nTypically a length of side looking infrared detectors that can detect if a wheel has locked up and is sliding along the track or has had the brakes lock up causing the entire wheel to heat up.\n\nThese detectors are typically a crude weighbridge and/or WILD system, as they are only concerned with measuring weight differentials.\nThey do not have to be as accurate as proper weighbridge or WILD systems, but just accurate enough to be able to average the weight of bogies during a train pass to calculate the relative balance of wagons, to establish if one rail is loaded unacceptably greater (in percentage) than the other. This is typically not performed on empty wagons because of the significant percentage imbalances that can be caused by fluctuations in weight due to bogie tracking geometry or hunting issues, which in terms of weight differentials are relatively accentuated compared to when a wagon is loaded.\n\nThese detectors can use a variety of sensors (video, laser, infrared), but typically they are a safety curtain arrangement: a gantry over the rail with sensors to detect anything outside the Clearance Gauge. \nThey therefore check the envelope of safety and alert if anything is detected outside of it.\n\nThese systems are different than dragging equipment detectors, which are looking for anything dragging from the train connecting with the sleepers.\nLow Hose detectors are looking specifically between two wagons, to measure the droop of the brake hoses. The brake hoses need a bit of droop, but too much and they can hit or dislodge.\nTypically, these systems employ a vertical bar installed on one side of the track, with infrared sensors pointed across the track at a mate bar with receivers installed pointed back at the infrared beams. When a train goes past, the infrared sensors are looking in the coupling area specifically, and will alert if anything is detected in the area that is lower than acceptable.\n\nThese systems rely on an array of video devices in various locations between the rails and either side of the track, looking for particular bogie components (such as brake beam, springs, friction wedges, etc) and this data is then put through image analysis to determine if there are maintenance issues.\n\nThese are laser arrays installed between or in place of a sleeper. They point up at the wheel profile and measure the profile shape specifically, taking various measurements of angles and lengths. The systems also give differential measurements for the two wheels of a wheelset.\n\nBogie performance detectors monitor bogie tracking geometry, and hunting (instability) behaviour. Bogie tracking geometry includes tracking position and angle of attack on a per-axle basis, as well as rotation, shift, inter-axle misalignment, and tracking error on a per-bogie basis. Bogie performance detectors can provide early detection of bogie defects, and early warning of derailment risks through flange climb or rail break.\nBogie performance detectors most often use optical methods, and are installed adjacent to the track with wheel sensors clamped to the rails.\n\nThese detectors either inject frequencies into the rail, or rely on existing track circuits, to detect rail breaks. These detectors are most commonly used by high speed networks.\n\nThese detectors are a mesh of small detectors installed against a particular stretch of rail. The detectors are typically a mix of temperature sensors and strain gauges (so measure in degrees Celsius and kilonewtons force). They measure temperature and stress/tension on the rail, to make sure these measures do not go outside the bounds of structural integrity. \nThese systems are initially calibrated to a particular ‘neutral state’ but measuring the rail with neutral compression (no pulling or pushing) and an agreed neutral ambient temperature. The system then measures the rail to detect if these parameters get too far from neutral state, and will alert if the rail is approaching a breach of structural integrity.\n\nThis is a combination of accelerometers on the track, and another accelerometer installed in the bedrock next to the track. The correlation of these measurements indicates how much track-born noise is propagating through the ballast into the bedrock strata. This correlates directly with the noise levels experienced by surrounding area.\nThese systems are commonly installed near or inside tunnels.\n\nThese are distinct from generic video imaging systems, as they are dedicated to specifically imaging the band above the rail that contains the brake shoe. The system identifies the back plate of the brake shoe, and then works out how much brake block is left in millimetres.\nIf the system detects no brake block beyond the back plate, the system typically identifies the pad as missing.\n\nA bridge spans the railroad with two laser beams that shine down on each side of the passing train. Anything that cuts through the beam will be counted as a defect. This sensor may also be integrated into the high car detector.\n\n\n"}

His father was an infant school headmaster, firstly in Edzell and then in Montrose. After school Hood attended the University of Edinburgh between 1934 and 1938.\n\nDuring the Second World War Hood served in the British Army as an Intelligence Officer. He spent a year in Italy as a prisoner of war before joining the partisans. His memoir of this period, \"Pebbles from my Skull\" was published in 1963, a revised version appeared in 1985. It is an unromantic account of the partisans in Italy and their relationship to the official allied forces.\n\nFrom 1961 until 1963, Hood was the Controller of the BBC Television Service. As Controller, he played a key role in changing the BBC's reputation from being a producer of stodgy, didactic programming in the tradition of Lord Reith to a more creative broadcaster. His tenures saw the launch of innovative programming such as on the police drama \"Z-Cars\", the satire \"That Was the Week That Was\" and the influential science fiction programme \"Doctor Who\" as well as the appearance of the first female newscaster Nan Winton. He became the overall Controller of BBC Television in 1963 with the preparations for the launch of the minority channel BBC2, with his former assistant Donald Baverstock working under him to Control BBC1 and Michael Peacock doing the same for the new channel. This arrangement was short-lived, he resigned from the BBC in the summer of 1964, although his period at Rediffusion London as Controller was short.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he was Professor of Film and Television at the Royal College of Art, School of Film and Television.\n\nHe was active in the ACTT union and was a member of the Workers Revolutionary Party between 1973 and 1978. In his youth, he had been a member of the Young Communist League and then the Communist Party of Great Britain.\n\nIn 1988, he hosted an edition of \"After Dark\" called \"What Do Women Want\" and featuring among others James Dearden, Mary Whitehouse, Joan Wyndham, Naim Attallah and Shere Hite.\n\nHood gained a reputation as a translator, beginning with Ernst Jünger's \"On the Marble Cliffs\" in 1946. He also translated Erich Fried, Aldo Busi, Dario Fo, Dino Buzzati, Goffredo Parise and Pier Paolo Pasolini.\n\nHis first book, \"The Circle of the Minotaur\" appeared in 1950. It contained two novels: \"The Circle of the Minotaur\" itself and \"The Fisherman's Daughter\". It was followed by another novel, \"Since the Fall\", in 1955.\n\n\"Pebbles from My Skull\", about the partisans in war-time Italy, was published in 1963 (Hutchinson) and revised in 1985 (Carcanet).\n\nHe wrote several books that analyze and critique the broadcasting industry, including \"A Survey of Television\" (1967), \"The Mass Media\" (Studies in Contemporary Europe) (1972), \"Radio and Television\" (Professions) (1975), \"Questions of Broadcasting\" with Garret O'Leary (1990), \"Behind the Screens: The Structure of British Television\" (1994), and \"On Television\" with Thalia Tabary-Peterssen (1997). He also wrote some novels, including \"A Storm From Paradise\" (1985), \"The Upper Hand\" (1987) and \"A Den of Foxes\" (1991).\n\nHood also translated the anti-Nazi German novelist Theodor Plievier's novel Berlin, which shows the 1941 Battle of Moscow from both German and Soviet perspectives.\n\n"}

The account as orally related, it was said that he had remained at Nayau whilst frequenting Lakeba on occasions and on one of those occasions he with a band of followers conspired against Rasolo. This was known by the Vakavanua of Nayau, the Tui Nayau's representative on Nayau on hearing of the plot told his son who was a young fellow to go and hide himself at the bow of the Drua and on arrival on Lakeba to immediately sneak and find his way to what is now Nakorovusa the old village site and relate the account of an assassination plot to the Sau on the guise of a friendly visit by his elder brother. The Sau on hearing of the imminent attempt on his life summoned the Tongans who were at the present village site of Tubou to stage a mock ceremonial reception to the visiting party while a dispatched war party lay ambush within the vicinity of a conversation hearing distance from where the formal reception was taking place . This went on until it was ascertained that the visiting party had no doubt fallen for the trap when the war party fell on the unsuspecting assailants and thence Uluilakeba and his followers were clubbed at a site known to the present day where an Ivi (chestnut) tree stands. However, for Uluilakeba himself an account also says that he retreated from the village site and onto the beach and made an attempt to swim for his life and on knowing that it would be futile, made a stand and hence clubbed. He came to his end and when they had apportioned him to the ovens his younger brother the Sau, Rasolo stopped what was to be a complete humiliation of the person of Uluilakeba and instead was to be left at where he had fallen.\n\nThe account of this unsuccessful aspirant's attempt went on to say that on the next day when the villagers went down to the beach his body had washed up on the beach eaten by sharks and a certain kind of white sea crab had gathered on what was left of his carcase. And that is why the custom with the Vuanirewa clan to this day are forbidden from the meat of the white tipped coral reef sharks and the Lairo vula (white sea crab) because of Uluilakeba's birthright entitlement.\n"}

Since the 2018–19 season, the league also includes two teams from Hungary. In 2009, it was ranked by the IIHF as the fifth strongest league in Europe and in 2012, it was ranked by \"The Hockey News\" as the sixth-strongest league in the world behind the NHL, KHL, Swedish Hockey League, SM-liiga and Czech Extraliga. However, it has dropped significantly since then, with the American Hockey League, Swiss National League, German DEL and Austrian EBEL, among others, all now ranked ahead.\n\nThe name of the league is leased to sponsors and changes frequently. From 1993/94 to 1997/98, it was called \"Extraliga\", then the name changed to \"West Extraliga\" until the end of the 2000/01 season. In 2001/02, its name was \"Boss Extraliga\". From the 2002/03 season to 2004/05, the name was \"ST Extraliga\" and in 2005/06 to \"T-Com Extraliga\". On 16 January 2007, the name changed to Slovnaft Extraliga when a general sponsorship agreement with Slovnaft was signed, in 2011/12 it became the Tipsport Extraliga and Slovnaft-Play-off, and since the 2015/16 season it has been called the Tipsport liga and Slovnaft-Play-off.\n\nThe Slovak Extraliga is rooted in the Czechoslovak Extraliga. The 1993/94 season was the first for the Slovak Extraliga after Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on 1 January 1993.\n\nEach regular season Tipsport liga game is composed of three 20-minute periods, with an intermission of a maximum of 18 minutes between periods. If the game is tied following the 60-minute regulation time, a five-minute three-on-three sudden death overtime period is played. If a game still is tied after the overtime period, a shootout decides the game. In a shootout, the team that scores the most penalty shots out of five attempts wins the game. If the game is still tied after the first five penalty-shot rounds, the shootout continues round by round, until one team scores while the other team fails to score.\n\nThe Tipsport liga season is divided into a regular season from late September through the beginning of March, when teams play against each other in a pre-defined schedule, and a playoffs from March to April, which is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Slovak champion, or \"Slovenský majster\" in Slovak, and receives the Trophy Vladimíra Dzurillu.\n\nThe regular season is a round-robin, where each team plays 55 games. Points are awarded for each game, where three points are awarded for winning in regulation time, two points for winning in overtime or shootout, one point for losing in overtime or shootout, and zero points for losing in regulation time. At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points is crowned the league champion. The six highest-ranked teams by points qualify directly for the playoffs. The four teams ranked 7–10 play a best-of-five series and battle for the two remaining playoff spots. The lowest ranked team after the regular season have to play in a relegation series called PlayOut together with best team from the second tier league Slovak 1. Liga. The two teams battle to win a best-of-seven series of PlayOut qualify for the next Tipsport liga season. Before the 2018–19 season, the eight highest-ranked teams qualified for the playoffs.\n\nIf two or more teams end up tied in points, the seeds are determined by the following tiebreaker format:\n\nStarting in the 2018–19 season, the four teams ranked 7–10 in the regular season play a best-of-five series, known as Play In, and battle for the two remaining playoff spots. The 7th-ranked team faces the 10th-ranked team, and the 8th-ranked team faces the 9th-ranked team. The 7th-ranked team and the 8th-ranked team receive home-ice advantage and play three of the five games at their home venue in their series if necessary to determine a winner of the series. The winners of the two best-of-five series take the two remaining playoff spots.\n\nThe Tipsport liga playoffs is an elimination tournament, where two teams battle to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. In the first round of the playoffs, or the quarterfinals, the top seed faces the lowest-ranked winner of the two best-of-three series (eighth seed, ninth seed or tenth seed); the 2nd-ranked seed faces the other winner of the two best-of-five series; the 3rd-ranked seed faces the 6th-ranked seed; and the 4th-ranked seed faces the 5th-ranked team. In the second round, the semifinals, the teams are re-seeded, with the top remaining seed playing against the lowest remaining seed, and the other two remaining teams pairing off. In the third round, the finals, the two remaining teams face each other.\n\nIn each series, the higher-ranked team of the two will have home-ice advantage. Four of the seven games are played at this team's home venue – the first and second, and, when necessary, the fifth and seventh games – with the other games played at the lower-ranked team's home venue.\n\nThe lowest ranked team after the regular season have to play in a relegation series called PlayOut together with best team from the second tier league Slovak 1. Liga. The two teams battle to win a best-of-seven series of PlayOut qualify for the next Tipsport liga season.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams from the league are playable in the video games EA Sports' NHL series only in NHL 2008.\n\n\n"}

FC Nürnberg in Germany. Svindal Larsen was capped 24 times for Norway.\n\nSvindal Larsen was born in Skien. In his youth, he was regarded as an exceptionally talented player. He made his senior debut for Odd in the First Division as a 15-year-old, and was signed by Start at 17 ahead of the 1991 season. While he played regularly for the Kristiansand club, he was overshadowed by other players and left Start at the end of the 1994 season, having only briefly showcased his great potential. He then joined newly promoted Stabæk.\n\nAt Stabæk, Svindal Larsen became a first-team regular. In the early years of his career, Svindal Larsen had been regarded as a creative attacking midfielder, but during his time at Stabæk he was converted to more of a midfield anchor, and thrived in that role. He formed an excellent midfield partnership at Stabæk alongside Martin Andresen, and won his first major trophy in 1998, when he captained the Stabæk side that won the Norwegian Cup.\n\nAfter six years at Stabæk, Svindal Larsen wanted to play abroad, and joined German side 1. FC Nürnberg on a Bosman free transfer at the end of the 2001 season. He spent four years with the Bundesliga side, playing more than a hundred games before returning home to his first club Odd where he spent the remainder of his career, captaining his hometown team for six seasons before retiring in 2011.\n\nSvindal Larsen was capped by Norway at every youth level from Under-15 to Under-21, and is current record holder for most total international games played for Norway's age-delimited national teams, with 99 youth caps in total, including a record 41 caps for Norway Under-21.\n\nHowever, despite his success at youth level, Svindal Larsen never truly made his mark in senior international football. He had to wait until April 1996, a few months before his 23rd birthday, before he got his full international debut in a friendly against Spain, and did not start an international match until a January 1999 friendly against Israel. In total, Svindal Larsen was capped \"only\" 24 times by Norway's senior national team, and ten of those appearances was as a substitute. Tired of being selected for the international squad only to sit on the bench, Svindal Larsen announced his retirement from international football in 2007.\n\nSvindal Larsen is married and has four children.\n"}

He appears to have travelled in Italy, the Netherlands, France and England, and on his return to have taken the degree of \"doctor juris\" at Basel.\n\nMost of his works were written from 1575 to 1581. During this period, he lived with, and was probably associated in the business of, his sister's husband, Bernhard Jobin, a printer at Strasbourg who published many of his books. In 1581 Fischart was attached as advocate to the Reichskammergericht (imperial court of appeal) at Speyer. In 1583, he married and was appointed \"Amtmann\" (magistrate) at Forbach near Saarbrücken. He died there in the winter of 1590–1591.\n\nThirty years after Fischart's death, his writings, once so popular, were almost entirely forgotten. Recalled to the public attention by Johann Jakob Bodmer and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, it was only around the end of the 1800s that his works came to be a subject of academic investigation, and his position in German literature to be fully understood.\n\nFischart studied not only ancient literature, but also the literature of Italy, France, the Netherlands and England. He was a lawyer, a theologian, a satirist and the most powerful Protestant publicist of the counter-reformation period; in politics he was a republican. His satire was levelled mercilessly at all perversities in the public and private life of his time, at astrological superstition, scholastic pedantry, ancestral pride, but especially at the papal dignity and the lives of the priesthood and the Jesuits. He indulged in the wildest witticisms, the most extreme caricature, obscenity, double entrendre; but all this he did with a serious purpose.\n\nAs a poet, he is characterized by the eloquence and picturesqueness of his style and the symbolical language he employed. He treats the German language with the greatest freedom, coining new words and turns of expression without any regard to analogy, and displaying, in his most arbitrary formations, erudition and wit.\n\nFischart wrote under pseudonyms; such as Mentzer, Menzer, Reznem, Huidrich Elloposkleros, Jesuwalt Pickhart, Winhold Alkofribas Wustblutus, Ulrich Mansehr von Treubach, and Im Fischen Gilts Mischen. There is doubt whether some of the works attributed to him are really his. More than 50 satirical works, in both prose and verse, remain considered his authentic work.\n\nAmong works believed to be his are:\n\nHe also wrote a number of smaller poems. To Fischart also have been attributed some \"Psalmen und geistliche Lieder\" which appeared in a Strasbourg hymn-book of 1576.\n\n\n"}

Throughout the mid-1980s, sales from catalog operations grew rapidly. \"Growth was explosive—25 to 30 percent a year,\" Cinader later recollected in \"The New York Times\". Annual sales grew from $3 million to more than $100 million over five years. In 1985, the \"Clifford & Wills\" brand was launched, selling women's clothing that was more affordable than the Popular Merchandise line.

In 2004, J.Crew bought the rights to the brand Madewell, a defunct workwear manufacturer founded in 1937, and used the name from 2006 onwards as \"a modern-day interpretation\", targeted at younger women than their main brand.\n\nIn 2006, the company held an IPO, raising $376 million by selling new shares equal to 33% of expanded capital. However, in 2011, TPG Capital LP and Leonard Green & Partners LP took J.Crew private again in a $3 billion leveraged buyout. On November 23, 2010, the company had agreed to be taken private in a $3 billion deal led by management with the backing of TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners, two large private equity firms. The announcement of the offer from two investment firms—including one that used to own J.Crew—came as the retailer reported that its third-quarter net income fell by 14 percent due to weak women's clothing sales. The company also lowered its guidance for the 2010 year. Under the deal as proposed, J.Crew shareholders would receive $43.50 per share in cash, representing a 16 percent premium to the stock's closing price the prior day of $37.65. CEO Mickey Drexler, the former Gap Inc. chief credited with turning J.Crew around since coming aboard in 2003, remained in that role and retained a \"significant\" stake in the company (as of September 2010, he holds 5.4% of outstanding shares).\n\nShortly after the announcement of the deal, some in the business community criticized the terms of the deal involving the company's CEO and a majority shareholder. As a result, the \"go-shop\" period was extended shortly after the initial announcement. In addition, several investigations relating to potential shareholder actions against the company were announced. After the deal, TPG and Leonard Green borrowed more to help finance dividends totaled $787 million to them.\n\nIn June 2015, \"The New York Times\" reported that J.Crew's women's division was undergoing a slump because of the company's failure to react to two market trends: cheap \"fast fashion\" and \"athleisure\" items. In 2016, J.Crew partnered with Nordstrom to begin selling their products in stores and online. In December 2016, the company faced litigation after it moved its intellectual property \"out of the reach of lenders.\"\n\nIn April 2017, the company cut 250 jobs, largely from its headquarters. The company also underwent several management changes, and long-term creative director Jenna Lyons left the company in April. The brand's longtime head of menswear, Frank Muytjens, left the company that month as well, and in June 2017, the company's CEO, Mickey Drexler, announced that he would later be stepping down as CEO role after 14 years with the company. Drexler announced he would stay on as chairman and still own 10% of the company. On June 12, 2017, J.Crew Group Inc. announced it had \"made an offer to some of its bondholders to push back its most pressing debt obligation—about $567 million due in May 2019—and amend its term loan.\" At the time, J.Crew Group had around $2 billion in debt. Also in 2017, Drexler approached Amazon Inc about selling J.Crew to the tech giant.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, the company avoided a bankruptcy filing by having bondholders do a debt swap tapping into its brand name value. The majority of the bondholders agreed to the deal, with several others failing to stop the deal with a lawsuit. The deal lowered the company's debt.\n\nIn September 2018, J.Crew began selling its standalone \"J.Crew Mercantile\" brand on Amazon.\n\nOn February 16, 2018, J.Crew hired Adam Brotman, a long-time Starbucks executive, as president and chief experience officer. Brotman's first major impact was launching \"J.Crew Rewards\", the company's first reward program independent of the company's credit card. The rewards program offers free shipping and $5 back for each $200 spent.\n\nIn November 2018, J.Crew announced its CEO, James Brett, would step down and be replaced by an office of the CEO consisting of four senior executives from J.Crew. Brett took up the position in June 2017. The company released a press release stating Brett's departure was a \"mutual agreement\" between Brett and the company's board of directors. Brett will be replaced by Michael Nicholson (president and COO), Adam Brotman (president and chief experience officer), Lynda Markoe (chief administrative officer), and Libby Wadle, president of Madewell Brand. The new office of the CEO will be responsible of managing J.Crew's operations as the board establishes a permanent management structure. On November 29, J.Crew announced the dissolution of their Nevereven, Mercantile, and J.Crew Home sub-brands.\n\nOn April 11, 2019, J.Crew announced that president and COO, Michael Nicholson, will retain the title of interim CEO, along with the subsequent announcement of Brotman's departure.\n\nJ. Crew reported a net income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, up from a net loss of $74.4 million in quarter four of 2018.\n\nOn January 28, 2020, the retailer announced that Jan Singer will assume title of CEO. Singer was previously CEO of Victoria's Secret, Spanx and was an executive at Nike. She will replace Nicholson who will assume his previous position.\n\nOn May 4, 2020, J. Crew filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, although the company had amassed enormous debt even before the outbreak.\n\nChinos Holdings, Inc. and 17 affiliated debtors filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Debtors have requested joint administration of the cases under Case No. 20-32181.\n\nThe company operates 506 retail stores, including 203 J.Crew stores, 129 Madewell stores, and 174 J.Crew Factory (including 42 J.Crew Mercantile) outlet locations, as reported in 2018. The company also operates internationally in Canada, France, the UK, and Hong Kong. Additionally, the company has 76 locations in Japan, which are operated under license by ITOCHU Corporation.\n\nIn March 1989, the first J.Crew retail outlet opened in the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, and the company planned to open 45 more stores. Five months after the opening of its first store, J.Crew added two new catalog lines: \"Classics\" and \"Collections.\" \"Collections\" used more complicated designs and finer fabrics to create dressier and more expensive items, while \"Classics\" featured clothes that could be worn both to work and for leisure activities. In the fall of 1989, J.Crew opened three new stores in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts; San Francisco, California; and Costa Mesa, California, all locations with strong catalog sales. By the end of the year, retail sales nearly hit $10 million. Despite 1989, revenues that year were estimated at $320 million, J.Crew suffered a setback when its agreement to sell its Popular Club unit collapsed at the end that year. In addition, rumors circulated that the company's Clifford & Wills low-priced women's apparel catalog was doing poorly.\n\nJ.Crew saw revenues reach $400 million in 1990 but reported that its four existing stores had not yet started producing enough profits to cover their overheads. The next phase of store openings included outlets in Philadelphia, Cambridge, and Portland. The company scaled back its plans for opening retail stores from 45 stores to 30 or 35. In early 1991 the company hired a director of new marketing development and began efforts to expand their sales into Canada. In April 1991, J.Crew mailed 75,000 J.Crew catalogs and 60,000 Clifford & Wills catalogs to potential customers in the province of Ontario. Response rates to this effort were slightly lower than in the United States, but each order, on average, was higher. In 1992, J.Crew intensified its push into international markets by hiring a new vice-president for international development. The company already mailed hundreds of catalogs to customers in Japan and Europe, most of whom had become acquainted with J.Crew while traveling or living in the United States.\nIn 2011, J.Crew opened its first international store in the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto, Ontario. In 2012, J.Crew announced four new Canadian locations: Edmonton, Alberta in West Edmonton Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia on Robson Street, and Toronto, Ontario in Fairview Mall (now closed) and the Toronto Eaton Centre. All locations will carry women's and men's collections. Along with 5 new stores, although some of these stores have been closed recently. J.Crew announced to opening of two new factory stores in Canada, with one in Vaughan Mills and the other in Edmonton (The second J.Crew in Alberta) Continuing with its expansion in the Greater Toronto Area, J.Crew opened at Markville Shopping Centre in 2013 (and now closed). In early 2014, J.Crew unveiled its new flagship location in Yorkville, Toronto.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Financial Times\" in 2011, CEO of J.Crew Mickey Drexler said that J.Crew would be expanding to the U.K. with their flagship store being on London's Regent Street. He indicated that the company would be following up their recent expansion into Canada and Canadian e-commerce with a physical store in England, most likely followed by e-commerce elsewhere, such as France and Germany. Although a few locations were reviewed for the London store, including Covent Garden and the East End, the ultimate decision was to open on Regent Street.\n\nIn early 2014, J.Crew announced plans to open brick-and-mortar locations in Asia – to be spearheaded by two establishments in Hong Kong. A women's store is slated to open in the International Finance Centre, while a men's shop is in the works for On Lan Street. Both opened for business in May 2014.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, J.Crew Group has closed 96 J.Crew and J.Crew Factory retail locations.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, J. Crew announced that it would pause the proposed Madewell IPO that was intended to be initiated on March 2. The company is considering a possible separation of J. Crew and Madewell into two separate companies.\n\nHistorically, each year the company issued 24 editions of the J.Crew catalog, distributing more than 80 million copies. Beginning in 2017, the catalog began being released with fewer pages and fewer issues per year.\n\nJ.Crew has been criticized for labeling its new super-small jeans as \"size 000\"., and for advertising them as \"toothpick jeans\". Critics have said the labeling promotes vanity, a practice known as vanity sizing. The \"size 000\" is smaller than a size zero and has three zeros, implying that it is two sizes smaller than the smallest normal size. This has caused people to question whether negative sizes will be available in the future, and if the method of labeling should be changed.\n\nIn early 2011, J.Crew was under fire by conservative media outlets for an advertisement featuring its creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, painting her son's toenails pink. Beneath the picture was a quote that read, \"Lucky for me I ended up with a boy whose favorite color is pink.\" Some people were of the opinion that J.Crew was challenging traditional gender identity roles, although author Jo B. Paoletti said that it was \"no big deal\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2143485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143485", "title": "Canudos", "text": "Canudos\n\nCanudos is a municipality in the northeast region of Bahia, Brazil. The original town, since flooded by the Cocorobó Dam, was the scene of violent clashes between peasants and republican police in the 1890s.\n\nThe municipality contains part of the Raso da Catarina ecoregion.\n\nThe town of Canudos was founded in the racially diverse Bahia state of northeastern Brazil in 1893 by Antônio Vicente Mendes Maciel, an itinerant preacher from Ceara. Mendes Maciel had been wandering through the backroads and lesser-inhabited areas of the country from the 1870s onwards, followed by a band of loyal supporters. As his following swelled, he took on the name Antônio Conselheiro (\"Antônio the Counselor\") and increasingly began to trouble the local authorities, who saw him as a Monarchist and thus a threat to their legitimacy.\n\nIn 1893, following a protest over taxation and a violent melee with the police forces in Masseté, Conselheiro and his band settled on an abandoned farm called Canudos, so called because a plant, \"canudo-de-pita\" (scientific name \"Ipomoea carnea\", its popular name referring to its hollow tubes, used for manufacturing smoking pipes) was common in the region. The place was named \"Belo Monte\" (Beautiful Mount) by Antonio Conselheiro, but the old name, \"Arraial de Canudos\", prevailed. Over the years people from across Bahia, including landless farmers, former slaves, indigenous people and \"cangaceiros\" flocked to join him, and within a few years the fledgling settlement numbered 30,000 people (which made it the second largest urban center in Bahia behind Salvador) and had developed a leather exporting business.\n\nAs a community, Canudos operated somewhat like a religious commune, with Antônio Conselheiro as the principal member and director. Canudos was a heavily religious settlement, under the sway of Antonio's fanaticism, but despite his fanaticism he did not assume any official position of authority. The settlement practiced common ownership, abolished the official currency, negated Brazilian national laws and participated collectively in the management of the town. Canudos was in essence a reaction against the contemporary Brazilian nation.\n\nNeither the local nor national government supported the settlement in Canudos. The local government of Bahia felt pressure from landowners to take action against the settlement because of labor shortages caused by migration. The Brazilian national government wanted a military expedition sent to destroy Canudos in the name of liberalism and progress. In the words of one historian, \"The mere existence of autonomous movements not subject to state control was antithetical to the national interest. Canudos stood for such autonomy, and therefore had to be destroyed.\"\n\nThe first three invasions were amply defeated by the villagers. However, in 1897, a considerably larger fourth invasion force managed to overwhelm the village. Their success was in part helped by the death, from dysentery, of Antônio Conselheiro, during the early stages of the siege. The Brazilian army showed no mercy, brutally massacring the survivors and destroying the entire village. An academician, Alvim Horcades, would thus describe the massacre:\n\n\"Eu vi e assisti a sacrificar-se todos aqueles miseráveis (...) e com sinceridade o digo: em Canudos foram degolados quase todos os prisioneiros (...) Arrancar-se a vida a uma criancinha (...) é o maior dos barbarismos e dos crimes que o homem pode praticar.\" (\"I saw and witnessed the sacrifice of all those poor people (...) and I say with all sincerity: in Canudos almost all the prisoners were beheaded (...) To take the life of a little child (...) is the greatest of cruelties and crimes man can commit.\")\n\nToday the area is submerged by water, the result of the Cocorobó Dam project in the 1970s, which blocked the Vaza-Barris River and flooded the old city. At low water the ruins of the church that was once the village's centrepiece can occasionally be seen. Once a year, in October, a mass is held to commemorate those lost in what is known today as the War of Canudos. The municipality of Nova Canudos was built nearby, at latitude 09º53'48\" South and longitude 39º01'35\" West, and currently has around 13,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe story of Canudos was told by war correspondent Euclides da Cunha in the book \"Os Sertões\" (1901; translated into English as \"Rebellion in the Backlands\", 1944), which helped inspire and provide material for the novel \"The War of the End of the World\" by Peruvian Nobel Laureate Mario Vargas Llosa (1981). The conflict was also described at length by Peter Robb in \"A Death in Brazil\" (2004). In fictional form it appears in the novel \"The First Garment\" (1975) by a Georgian writer Guram Dochanashvili.\n\nThe municipality contains the Canudos State Park, created in 1986 to commemorate the War of Canudos.\n\n\n"}

In 1830–1834 and 1838–1840 he travelled in Italy, Greece, Asia Minor and Egypt. In 1843 he was appointed professor of philology at Kiel and director of the archaeological museum founded by himself in co-operation with Otto Jahn.\n\nForchhammer was an active democrat, and from 1871 to 1873 represented the progressive party of Schleswig-Holstein in the German Reichstag. His published works deal chiefly with topography and ancient mythology. His travels had convinced him that a full and comprehensive knowledge of classical antiquity could only be acquired by a thorough acquaintance with Greek and Roman monuments and works of art, and a detailed examination of the topographical and climatic conditions of the chief localities of the ancient world. These principles are illustrated in his \"Hellenika Griechenland Im Neuen das Alte\" (1837), which contains his theory of the origin and explanation of the Greek myths, which he never abandoned, in spite of the attacks to which it was subjected. According to him, the myths arose from definite local (especially atmospheric and aquatic) phenomena, and represented the annually recurring processes of nature as the acts of gods and heroes; thus, in \"Achill\" (1853), the Trojan War is the winter conflict of the elements in that district.\n\nOther similar short treatises are:\n\nAmong his topographical works mention may be made of:\n\nHis \"Demokratenbüchlein\" (1849), in the main a discussion of the Aristotelian theory of the state, and \"Die Athener und Sokrates\" (1837), in which, contrary to the almost universal opinion, he upheld the procedure of the Athenians as perfectly legal and their verdict as a perfectly just one, also deserve notice.\n"}
{"id": "2143492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143492", "title": "Texas Education Agency", "text": "Texas Education Agency\n\nThe Texas Education Agency (TEA) is the branch of the government of Texas responsible for public education in Texas in the United States. The agency is headquartered in the William B. Travis State Office Building in downtown Austin. Mike Morath, formerly a member of the Dallas Independent School District's board of trustees, was appointed commissioner of education by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Dec. 14, 2015, and began serving on Jan. 4, 2016.\n\nPrior to the late 1940s, many school districts in Texas did not operate schools, but spent money to send children to schools operated by other districts. In the late 1940s, state lawmakers passed a bill abolishing those districts, prompting a wave of mass school district consolidation.\n\nTEA is responsible for the oversight of public primary and secondary education in the state of Texas, involving over 1,000 individual school districts in the state and charter schools. It is also responsible for the safety of students. However, it does not have any jurisdiction over private or parochial schools (whether or not accredited) nor over home schools.\n\nAlthough school districts are independent governmental entities, TEA has the authority to oversee a district's operations (either involving an individual school or the entire district) if serious issues arise (such as poor standardized test performance, financial distress, or mismanagement). This can be in the form of requiring the district to submit corrective action plans and regular status reports, assigning monitors to oversee operations (including the authority to assign a management board, which essentially replaces and performs the duties of the elected school board), and in extreme cases closure of a school campus or even the entire school district.\n\nThe University Interscholastic League (UIL), which oversees academic and athletic interscholastic competition in Texas public schools, is a separate entity not under TEA oversight.\n\nIn addition to primary and secondary education, TEA has oversight duties with respect to driver's education courses (initial permits) and defensive driving courses (used to have a ticket dismissed and/or for lower insurance premiums).\n\nOn November 7, 2007, Christine Comer resigned as the director of the science curriculum after more than nine years. Comer said that her resignation was a result of pressure from officials who claimed that she had given the appearance of criticizing the teaching of intelligent design.\n\nIn 2009, the board received criticism from more than 50 scientific organizations over an attempt to weaken science standards on evolution.\n\nIn 2010, a group of historians, including Jean A. Stuntz of West Texas A&M University in Canyon, Texas, signed a petition to oppose the revisions in the social studies curricula approved by the state board, changes which require the inclusion of conservative topics in public school instruction. For instance, Jefferson's name must be restored to a list of Enlightenment thinkers. There must be emphasis on the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in regard to property rights. Students must be taught that new documents, the Venona project, and verify U.S. Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's suspicions of communist infiltration of the U.S. government during the post-World War II era. Stuntz told the \"Amarillo Globe-News\" that the SBOE is \"micromanaging. They don't know what they're doing.\"\n\nIn October 2012, \"The Revisionaries\", a documentary film about the re-election of the chairman of the Texas Board of Education Don McLeroy and the curriculum controversy, was released. In late January 2013, PBS's \"Independent Lens\" aired an abridged version the film.\n\nTexas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, Texas said that the government should \"take a look\" at the structure of the board and consider a nonpartisan or appointed board if the elected members are \"not getting their job done and they're not pleasing the Legislature or the citizens, then we ought to take) a thorough look at what they are doing.\" In 2010, it was said to be \"drafting its own version of American history\", including altering school textbooks to remove what it said was a \"left-leaning bias\" and making changes that are said to have \"religious and racial overtones\".\n\nFor example, the proposed curriculum would downplay Thomas Jefferson's emphasis on the separation of church and state (outlined in his Letter to Danbury Baptists), and would include a greater emphasis on the importance of religion to the founding fathers. Other changes include downplaying Abraham Lincoln's role in the civil war and putting more emphasis on the Confederate leader Jefferson Davis, questioning the Civil Rights Movement in addition to downplaying Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy, removing such instances and points of history such as downplaying slavery, putting more emphasis on the states rights cause during the Civil War. Critics of the proposed changes believe that such a focus on the religious elements of the founding period could cause teachers to omit lessons on history more pertinent to national standards.\n\nThe current commissioner of education is Mike Morath. A former member of the Dallas Independent School District's board of trustees, he was appointed commissioner of education by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Dec. 14, 2015.\n\nThe commissioner's role is to lead and manage the Texas Education Agency. The commissioner also co-ordinates efforts between state and federal agencies.\n\nTEA is overseen by a 15-member State Board of Education, elected from single-member districts for four years.\n\nThe board devises policies and sets academic standards for Texas public schools, and oversees the state Permanent School Fund and selects textbooks to be used in Texas schools.\n\nSince 2011, the board can still recommend textbooks, but public school districts can order their own books and materials even if their selections are not on the state-approved list. So far, most districts have continued to follow the state-endorsed textbooks, but that trend is expected to change in the next two years as the districts become more cognizant of their available options. Thomas Ratliff, a moderate Republican and the son of former Lieutenant Governor Bill Ratliff of Mount Pleasant, in 2010 unseated the Bryan dentist Don McLeroy, a former education board chairman who was the leader of the conservative bloc. Ratliff said in 2013 that the board is \"far different\" in political complexion that it was in 2010. Though the Republicans hold 10 of the 15 seats, social conservatives are no longer in the majority.\n\nTo serve the large number of individual school districts and charter schools in Texas, TEA is divided into 20 regions, each containing an educational service center (sometimes called regional service center).\n\nTEA rates schools and districts using the same four criteria. According to the TEA, the number of state schools and districts receiving the top ratings of \"exemplary\" and \"recognized\" increased from 2,213 in 2005 to 3,380 in 2006.\n\nIn addition to the state ranking, districts and schools can be awarded additional commendations (referred to as Gold Performance acknowledgements) for other noteworthy accomplishments not included in the ranking system.\n\nThe Texas Education Agency is funded by the people of the State of Texas, at the direction of their elected legislature and with the consent of the Governor of Texas. The agency's budget must be approved on the legislature's biannual schedule. Revenues for the agency come from the state general fund (primarily sales taxes), the federal government, the Permanent School Fund (a sovereign wealth fund created by the state with revenues from public lands), and other sources.\n\n\n"}

After a number of unsuccessful attempts at military suppression, the conflict came to a brutal end in October 1897 when a large Brazilian army force overran the village and killed nearly all the inhabitants. This conflict marks the deadliest civil war in Brazilian history.\n\nThe conflict had its origins in the settlement of Canudos (named by its inhabitants \"Belo Monte\" meaning \"Beautiful Hill,\" in the semi-arid backlands (\"sertão\" or \"caatinga\", in Portuguese) in the northeast tip of the state (then province) of Bahia. At this time, Bahia was a desperately poor zone with a depressed economy based on subsistence agriculture and cattle raising. It was without large cities and the disenfranchised population drew equally from rural and urban portions of the region and represented a \"broad spectrum of ethnic and economic origins.\" It was a fertile background for dissatisfaction with the new republic, declared November 15, 1889 after a military coup against the ruling Emperor, Dom Pedro II, who was still beloved by the common people.\n\nThis period was characterized by high levels of uncertainty when the military was fighting to put down revolts all over the country. It was, therefore, unpopular and dangerous to be branded anything other than Republican during this time. At the onset of this early Republican era, Antônio Vincente Mendes Macial, also known as Antônio Conselheiro (\"Antônio, the Counselor\") rose to prominence. He was one of the many religious figures that pilgrimed in the backlands of Brazil. He went from village to village with his followers, doing small jobs and garnering support from small farmers. As an increasing number of supporters joined his cause, Conselheiro caused a disturbance in the labor force, which led him to be antagonized by some property owners. He claimed to be a prophet and predicted the return of the legendary Portuguese king Sebastian of Portugal (see Sebastianism). His writings uncovered that he held the belief that \"it was the Monarch’s God-given right to rule,\" which is why he was progressively perceived as a Monarchist figure by the unstable Republic at the time. After wandering through the provinces of Ceará, Pernambuco, Sergipe and Bahia, he decided in 1893 to settle permanently with his many followers in the farming community of Canudos, near Monte Santo, Bahia on the Vaza-Barris River. Within two years, Conselheiro managed to convince several thousands of followers to join him in joining his prosperous religious community in the backlands of Bahia, thus making it the second-largest urban center in Brazil's second most populous state of Brazil at the time. \n\nA specific incident was the catalyst for Canudos’ eventual destruction. Conselheiro had placed his usual order of wood from a neighboring business in Joazeiro to build a new church. However, said order was not delivered as it seemed that the new local judge antagonized Conselheiro and thus prevented the delivery. Some \"canudenses\" took it upon themselves to go to Joazeiro to claim the wood. Judge Arlindo Leoni manipulated the situation by requesting police forces from state governor Luis Viana to defend his town against an \"invasion\" by Conselheiro and his people. Vianna recounts that he had been informed by Leoni \"of rumors which were current, and which were more or less well-founded, to the effect that the flourishing city in question [Juazeiro] was to be assaulted within a few days by Antônio Conselheiro’s followers.\"\n\nWhile the troops were initially dispatched for the sole purpose of preventing assault, Leoni managed to convince commander Pires Ferreira to march on Canudos. With scant information about terrain and the size and defensive resources of Canudo's population, a small, 100-man force commanded by Ferreira was deployed on November 4, 1896. However, the \"canudenses\" marching from the religious settlement to Joazeiro surprised the local troops at Uauá and a fierce battle ensued. Estimates of the number of \"conselheiristas\" that were deployed vary anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 men, and accounts report that they were armed with \"old muskets, pikes, scythes, long poles, and implements of the land.\" Despite some considerable losses (estimated at around 150 men), the canudenses claimed victory over the soldiers and drove them off. The troops thus retreated to Juazeiro and awaited reinforcements from the state of Bahia.\n\nThe government and the media quickly picked up on the soldiers’ loss in the backlands of Bahia. The media played an essential role in escalating the conflict; it spread rumors that the \"anti-Republican\" settlement was allied with other Monarchists to launch a \"Restoration\" movement. This increasingly unstable political climate, added to the scarcity of military resources in Bahia, led the provincial government to get national forces involved in order to crush the increasingly threatening settlement. As the United States of Brazil had only recently been founded, and it saw the rebel settlers as monarchists, separatists, a bad example and a threat to the new regime.\n\nPresident Prudente de Morais sent a punitive military expedition and the Brazilian Army began to prepare in November 1896. With scant information about terrain and the size and defensive resources of Canudo's population, a small, 104-man force commanded by Lieutenant Pires Ferreira attacked the settlement on November 21, 1896. It was fiercely defended, however, by a band of 500 armed men, shouting praises to Antonio Conselheiro and the monarchy. The Brazilian soldiers retreated after incurring severe losses and killing 150 settlers, many armed only with machetes, primitive lances and axes.\nThe defeat of the Pires Ferreira campaign and the sensationalist reports about the ferocity and fanaticism of Canudos’ inhabitants provoked an outcry, and calls for reprisals against the village, which was growing by leaps and bounds and eventually reached 30,000 residents. On January 12, 1897, the federal troops, which comprised 547 men, 14 officers, and 3 surgeons left for Canudos. Their second clash against the \"conselheiristas\" occurred on January 18 and led to the death of 115 insurgents with minimal losses on the army's side. After some initial success with the infantry and artillery against the villagers' trenches, however, the soldiers were surrounded by more than 4,000 insurrectionists. Lacking ammunition, food and water, and unable to resist the rebels, who continued to fight despite heavy losses, the soldiers retreated once again to Monte Santo to await reinforcements.\n\nWhat was particularly striking about this expedition was the way in which the \"canudenses\" had claimed victory. The fighters completely destroyed areas within a radius of seven miles of Canudos: they burned ranches and farm buildings, thus leaving a circle of charred ground. Amidst a background of journalistic war cries, the \"canudenses\" crushing victory led national military and civilian authorities to label Canudos a considerable threat to national order and the prestige of the armed forces and the new government.\n\nAn experienced colonel, Antônio Moreira César, set out with three infantry battalions, one cavalry and one artillery battalion, all newly armed and trained. On February 20, backed with 1,300 troops, Moreira arrived to Monte Santo. A day later, completely disregarding \"the intense heat and parched land,\" a little over a thousand men advanced on Canudos. The military forces reportedly carried \"seventy rounds of cannon-balls and sixteen million rounds of ammunition.\"\n\nAlthough forewarned about the numbers and resolve of the rebels, the military thought it impossible that the rebels would resist such a strong regular army force. However, their equipment quickly turned out be inadequate for the backlands. Wagon trains that carried supplies \"sank up to their hubs in sand.\" The troops nonetheless continued their forced march to Canudos, which they fired cannon-balls at upon arrival.\n\nHowever, the bombings had turned the settlement of huts into a \"maze\" that was impossible for the soldiers to navigate. On March 6, 1897, after only two days of fighting, the surviving officers had no choice but to vote to retreat. Moreira César's protests were overlooked, and he died before dawn due to a fatal wound.\n\nPressured, the Federal government sent a new expedition under General Arthur Oscar de Andrade Guimarães, and with the direct involvement of the Minister of War, who personally visited Monte Santo, a city near Canudos which served as the gathering point for the large army force being assembled. Machine guns and large artillery pieces, such as mortars and howitzers, including a powerful Whitworth 32 (nicknamed \"Matadeira\" (Killer)) went with the 3,000-man force, and had to be hauled with enormous effort through the unforgiving roadless landscape.\n\nThe troops set off on June 16. This time, the attackers were aided by rampant hunger and malnutrition among the inhabitants of Canudos, the rebels' lack of weapons and ammunition, and the heavy losses they had suffered in the previous attacks. The first battalion consisted of 2,350 men, hundreds of whom were trapped by the \"canudenses\" and slaughtered. Fearing another failed expedition, the troops retreated to the town of Monte Santo.\n\nThe second assault began a month later and involved over 8,000 soldiers. The troops encircled and starved the population of Canudos into starvation and submission. The last assault persisted until the beginning of October the military forces set off 90 dynamite bombs in the settlement, thus marking the defeat of the people of Canudos. Reports of the fighting state that hundreds of Canudos defenders and federal soldiers died every day.\n\nThroughout this expedition, an undetermined number of \"canudenses\" fled the settlement. Those who stayed, however, were fooled into surrendering with the promise of being spared. One of the forces' generals, however, had the men \"rounded by soldiers, and hacked to death in front of hundreds of witness, including many of their wives and children.\" Immediately after the final assault, soldiers \"smashed, leveled, and burned all 5,200 in the settlement.\"\n\nIt was eventually determined that Conselheiro had likely died of dysentery on September 22. Before Canudos was burned down and dynamited, Conselheiro's body was exhumed, the head was removed, and it was \"displayed on a pike\" to be \"held high at the front of a military parade for all to see.\" According to Peter Robb, it \"was taken to the Medical Faculty of Bahia to be studied for abnormalities.\" When all resistance ceased and \"peace\" was restored, only 150 survivors remained. The best-looking surviving women were taken captive and sent to brothels in Salvador.\n\nSome authors, such as Euclides da Cunha (1902) estimated the number of deaths in the War of Canudos was ca. 30,000 (25,000 residents and 5,000 attackers) , but some argue that the real number may have been lower (around 15,000). According to Peter Robb, \"[t]he foreign correspondents who covered what was soon being called the War of Canudos, as if it were a conflict between nations rather than the extermination of a tiny community within a single country, were nearly all embedded with the army of the Brazilian republic.\"\n\nEuclides da Cunha did not see the fighting but did bear witness afterward, Robb says, and his \"obsession with progress and modernity, the scientific racism that told him the people of the northeastern interior were doomed to backwardness by their mixed race\" led him to tell a story filled with preconceptions- which is, however, the only story we have.\n\nAlthough the original town of Canudos has been covered by the reservoir of the Cocorobó Dam, built by the military regime in the 1960s, the Canudos State Park, established in 1986, preserves many of the important sites and serves as a monument to the war. The stated purpose of the park is to make it impossible to forget the martyrs led by Antônio Conselheiro.\n\n\n\n\n"}

With a circulation of 200,050 (as of April 2011), it was the country's biggest selling weekly, ahead of \"Newsweek\"s Polish edition, \"Newsweek Polska\", and \"Wprost\". \"Polityka\" has a slightly intellectual, socially liberal profile, setting it apart from the more conservative \"Wprost\" and the glossier approach of \"Newsweek Poland\". Prominent editors and permanent contributors have included Adam Krzemiński, Janina Paradowska, Daniel Passent, Ludwik Stomma, Adam Szostkiewicz, Jacek Żakowski, Ryszard Kapuściński, Jerzy Urban, and Krzysztof Zanussi.\n\nEstablished in 1957, after Stalinism had subsided in Poland, \"Polityka\" slowly developed a reputation for moderately critical journalism, promoting economical way of thinking, although always remaining within the communist-imposed boundaries that still constrained the press. Notably, \"Polityka\" was launched to replace the more radical \"Po prostu\" (1947–1957). \n\nThe first editor-in-chief of \"Polityka\" was Stefan Żółkiewski who served in the post from 1957 to 1958. Mieczysław Rakowski was a long-time editor of the publication and he served in the post between 1958 and 1982. It was he who would become the final First Secretary of the Polish Communist Party, the last communist prime minister of Poland, and who would eventually oversee the winding down of communist rule in Poland in 1989. \"Polityka\" supported the Round Table talks, which concluded with an agreement to hold the free elections that would result in a peaceful end to communist rule in Poland. The magazine achieved renown in 1961 when it printed five parts of Adolf Eichmann's memoires that had been stolen and given to it by anti-Nazis (the only other magazine that acquired fragments of these memoires was \"Life\"). It earned the ire of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1983 after expressing a favorable view of political pluralism.\n\nJan Bijak became editor-in-chief of the magazine in 1982 and served in the post until 1994. After the fall of communism in 1989, \"Polityka\" continued to play an influential role as part of Poland's newly free press. In 1990, the \"Polityka\" team left the state-owned publisher RSW Prasa-Książka-Ruch with rights to the title, and established an independent cooperative called \"\"Polityka\" - Spółdzielnia Pracy\". Such a publishing cooperative is unique in the Polish press. Since 1994, the editor of \"Polityka\" has been Jerzy Baczyński. In 1995, the format was switched from a broadsheet to a standard colour magazine, which has more than 100 pages per issue.\n\nIn 2001 \"Polityka\" had a circulation of 245,000 copies. The circulation of the magazine was 143,089 copies in 2010 and 133,324 copies in 2011. It was 124,761 copies in 2012. The print and e-edition circulation of the weekly was 127,732 in August 2014.\n\nSince 1959, \"Polityka\" has awarded its History Award (for history book of the year), and, since 1993, an annual award for the arts, the Paszport Polityki. Since the late 1990s, it has also funded scholarships for young scientists.\n\n"}

It won two TVB Anniversary Awards, including Best Actor for Louis Koo and Best Actress for Jessica Hsuan.\n\nThe series focuses on the lives of two detectives, Tsui Fei (Louis Koo) and Kong Chi Shan (Sunny Chan), and the murder cases they deal with.\n\nBecause of his misbehavior, Tsui Fei (Louis Koo) is a sergeant sent to work with Senior Inspector Kong Tze Shan's (Sunny Chan) homicide team at the Hong Kong Central Police Station. He has been emotionally unstable since the disappearance of his girlfriend Leung Chin Chin (Anne Heung) three years earlier. At first, his attitude is not welcomed by the other officers, especially Hon Kwok Yan (Edmond So), but they soon get along. Fei and Tze Shan eventually become best friends.\n\nWhile investigating his first murder case, Fei meets psychologist Quin Mo Chiu Kwan (Jessica Hsuan) and the two fell in love. Because Fei still misses his ex-girlfriend, the two frequently quarrel.\n\nTze Shan has a beautiful girlfriend, Man Yuen Lan (Charmaine Sheh), but Yuen Lan's best friend Tong Sum Yu (Lee San San) is also in love with him. Sum Yu tries hard to stop loving Tze Shan, until Yuen Lan's father Man Kwok Tai (Law Lok Lam) kills Leung Kim Hung (Kwok Fung) - Tze Shan's fellow officer and Chin Chin's brother - in order to frame an old enemy. Kwok Tai forces his daughter to assist his crime, but in the end they are both captured and sent to prison. Yuen Lan gives Tze Shan up because of this.\n\nWithout Yuen Lan in the way, Sum Yu and Tze Shan quickly developed a relationship and even decided to marry. Yuen Lan has already been released from prison. Yuen Lan asked if they can have a chance to get back to together. Tze Shan said he already hurt Yuen Lan, and Yuen Lan will always be in his heart. He can't hurt another person. Tze Shan still chooses Sum Yu and Yuen Lan also accepts the truth. Meanwhile, Tze Shan's sister Kong Tze Ching (Maggie Siu) re-encounters her long-lost twin sister Tze Yiu (also played by Siu), but Tze Yiu turns out to be a lunatic and is involved with a murder case. Tze Ching tries to hide her but she cannot stop her from attending Tze Shan's wedding. Tze Yiu's emotions were stable at first but she suddenly has hallucinations of the man she murdered and tries to kill him with a knife. Unfortunately, her hallucinations appear right in front of Sum Yu who is stabbed to death as a result. Tze Shan is devastated and tries to rekindle his relationship with Yuen Lan, but Yuen Lan has decided to leave for Yunnan. Deep down, Tze Shan likes Yuen Lan more, but he felt bad because of what his sister did.\n\nMeanwhile, Chin Chin suddenly reappears, and Fei discovers that Chin Chin had been held captive by gangster Cheng Tung Shing (Roger Kwok) for all these years. Tung Shing was friends with Fei, when Fei was an undercover in the triads, but their friendship turned to hatred when Fei revealed his identity. Tung Shing managed to escape and swore revenge against Fei. He kidnapped Chin Chin for future use. Finally, Tung Shing is defeated and sent to jail. Fei reluctantly breaks up with Quin as he felt he had owed Chin Chin way too much.\n\nThe last seconds of the show's finale hint that Quin has developed a relationship with Tze Shan.\n\n\n\n\n\"Detective Investigation Files IV\" was shot with a whole new cast since the main stars of the original three installments, Michael Tao and Joey Leung, had left TVB. Nevertheless, it still became one of the highest-rated series in the territory in 1999 when it was aired for the first time.\n\nKoo and Hsuan received the Favorite Actor and Actress Awards for the series in TVB's 32nd Anniversary respectively. Emilia's song \"Big Big World\" was featured in the show, and it became a great hit in Hong Kong during 1999 and 2000.\n\nThe VCD box set of \"Detective Investigation Files IV\" is now available for sale worldwide.\n\nThis scene caused an uproar in Hong Kong, which later resulted in it being cut from overseas versions.\n\nThe scene takes place in a bar, where Mo Chiu Kwan is sitting watching soccer on TV. Tsui Fei walks into the bar, sees her and asks why she is here. She answers that there are more men here. Tsui then takes a call (possibly from Chin Chin), while a man walks over to Kwan in the background. Tsui Fei looks over, not knowing who the guy is and smiles. The guy whispers something in Kwan's ear and they laugh. then his face is revealed and it's Kong Tze Shan! Tsui Fei's expression changes immediately. Many viewers were unsure if the expression was a sign of jealousy or just surprise.\n\nMany people in Hong Kong were not satisfied with the ending of the series, when Tsui Fei left Mo Chiu Kwan for Leung Chin Chin, because they thought that he was responsible for the latter's suffering. TVB constantly receives requests to film the fifth in the series in which Tsui and Mo reunite, but so far there are no signs that it will happen.\n\nThe reason to this may be due to the loss of most of the original cast. Sunny Chan left TVB shortly after filming the series, and Lee San San also stopped acting. Louis Koo also turned to cinema and singing a few years later. Although Sunny Chan returned to TVB in 2004 (and even starred in a drama with Jessica Hsuan), the \"Detective Investigation Files\" phenomenon had already faded by that time. Meanwhile, Jessica Hsuan and Charmaine Sheh are still two of TVB's most popular actresses.\n\n"}

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 2002. In the episode, the Simpsons family get arrested for domestic violence, prompting social worker Gabriel to move in and make the family functional. After the family is declared acceptable, Amber and Ginger, the cocktail waitresses Homer and his neighbor Ned Flanders married in Las Vegas, show up at their doorsteps.\n\n\"Brawl in the Family\" was directed by Matthew Nastuk and was the first full episode Joel H. Cohen received a writing credit for. It was the first episode on which Al Jean served as sole showrunner. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to produce a sequel to the season 10 episode \"Viva Ned Flanders\", which he thought had a \"loose end\". The episode features Jane Kaczmarek as Judge Constance Harm, and Delroy Lindo as Gabriel.\n\nIn its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 12.8 million viewers, making it the 28th most watched program the week it aired. \n\nLater that year, the episode was nominated for an Environmental Media Awards in the category \"Television Episodic - Comedy\", which it ultimately lost to the \"Dharma & Greg\" episode \"Protecting the Ego-System\". Following its home video release, \"Brawl in the Family\" received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe Republican Party of Springfield decide to make caring for the environment a felony offense; the resulting pollution causes an acid rainfall, destroying the Simpsons' TV antenna and prompting them to stay inside and play a game of Monopoly to pass the time. When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces, Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him. Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart. Despite her inability to talk, Maggie calls the police on her family before taking hold of Marge and attempting to pull her off Homer. With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance.\n\nAfter a short time in jail, they are released by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven. Gabriel moves in with the family to help them be functional again. After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the family by medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree. The object is for the family to work together as a team to get it down. After a harrowing rescue involving Bart driving the family car and Homer nearly becoming prey for wild predators, the Simpsons succeed and Gabriel congratulates them on working together as a family and becoming functional during their drive home.\n\nBefore the family can call it a day, they arrive home and find Amber and Ginger waiting in their driveway, causing Gabriel to storm off in disgust. Amber shows Marge and the kids video footage of a drunk Homer marrying her in Vegas, while Ginger is next door with the widowed Ned Flanders. Homer tries to get his marriage to Amber annulled by the court, but Judge Constance Harm refuses, stating that Homer married Amber in Nevada and the marriage still stands, since Homer never officially divorced Amber. Marge is so angry that she banishes Homer, who takes up residence in Bart's treehouse with Amber, who attempts to seduce him by making him sandwiches, arousing Marge's jealousy. Amber also unsuccessfully tries to bond with Bart and Lisa, who resent her for destroying their family. Homer still loves Marge and refuses to sleep with Amber, so he tries to sleep in Santa's Little Helper's kennel, but ends up getting its doorway stuck to his head and spends the rest of the night trying to get it off, as Marge watches from the window and begins to have a change of heart. The next day, Marge finds Homer asleep amid the broken remains of the doghouse, and asks him to come inside to talk with her, although she is still angry at him over what he did.\n\nWhile Amber is lounging in a kiddie pool, she overhears Homer and Marge arguing about her, with Homer ultimately announcing that he is leaving Marge and the kids. Homer then invites Amber to Moe's for a night of drinking, while Marge and the kids eavesdrop from outside. The next day, a hungover Amber discovers that she is now married to Grampa Simpson, and the Simpsons have video evidence of the event about her vowing to forsake all other husbands when married to Grampa. Amber and Ginger, who is fed up with Ned, hurriedly drive back to Vegas. The family celebrates their victory through sticking together, while Grampa, at first despondent over Amber leaving him, quickly learns to be content with it.\n\n\"Brawl in the Family\" was directed by Matthew Nastuk and was the first episode Joel H. Cohen received a sole writing credit for. Cohen had previously received a credit for \"Hex and the City\", the first segment of \"Treehouse of Horror XII\" which aired the previous year. \"Brawl in the Family\" originally aired on January 6, 2002 on the Fox network. It was the first episode for which current showrunner Al Jean served as sole showrunner. It was the second of his episodes to air however, since the Christmas-themed \"She of Little Faith\", the second episode he produced, was chosen to air first as it would coincide with the holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to make a follow-up to the season 10 episode \"Viva Ned Flanders\". In it, Homer takes Ned to Las Vegas to teach him how to have fun. While there, the two get intoxicated and wake up the next morning to find that they have married two cocktail waitresses, Amber and Ginger. The episode ends with Homer and Ned walking home from Vegas. Jean felt that the ending to \"Viva Ned Flanders\" was \"a bit loose\" because \"...if you leave a wife in Vegas, they track you down.\" He pitched \"Brawl in the Family\" in order to \"resolve it [the ending to 'Viva Ned Flanders'].\" Amber and Ginger were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively.\n\n\"Brawl in the Family\" features British actor and theater director Delroy Lindo as Gabriel, the social worker. According to Jean, Lindo was chosen to guest star because of his \"great voice.\" Gabriel was then designed to match Lindo's voice. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Lindo expressed dissatisfaction with the character's design. He said \"Were I an audience member, looking at this [the episode] I'd think, 'That guy doesn't sound like he looks.'\" However, he added that his appearance in the episode earned him \"much cred\" among his nieces and nephews. In an interview with The A.V. Club, he said \"After I did that voiceover, I was very aware of the power of \"The Simpsons\", because in certain quarters, I got instant credibility.\" The episode also features Jane Kaczmarek as Judge Constance Harm.\n\nOn its original American broadcast on January 6, 2002, \"Brawl in the Family\" was watched by approximately 12.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. It became the 28th most watched program of the week it aired, beating such shows as ABC's \"8 Simple Rules\" and NBC's \"Crossing Jordan\" and \"Mister Sterling\". \n\nLater that year, the episode was nominated for an Environmental Media Award in the category \"Television Episodic - Comedy\", which it ultimately lost to the \"Dharma & Greg\" episode \"Protecting the Ego-System\". Its nomination was based solely on a scene in which \"a bigger fish eats a smaller three-eyed fish\", according to Jean, and because the award show was short on nominees. On August 24, 2010, \"Brawl in the Family\" was released as part of \"The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season\" DVD and Blu-ray set. Al Jean, Joel H. Cohen, Max Pross, Delroy Lindo, Matt Warburton and David Silverman participated in the audio commentary of the episode.\n\nFollowing its home video release, \"Brawl in the Family\" received mixed reviews from critics. Aaron Peck of High-Def Digest criticized the episode for being unoriginal, writing \"Homer is always doing something that jeopardizes his marriage to Marge. When Homer's 'Vegas Wife' shows up unexpectedly [...] the same thing happens. This is a storyline that has worn out its welcome, but it still continues.\" 411Mania's Ron Martin described the episode as having a \"ridiculous set up\". Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well, calling it \"Mannered to the point of ridiculousness.\" While he didn't consider it the worst episode he's ever seen, he criticized the episode's pacing and lack of satire, writing \"it’s just that the plates spin so fast and so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags. [...] the satire is gone; it’s just incident after incident to set up gags (some of which are funny) and get the show to an end time.\"\n\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson wrote that the episode \"seems like two story fragments combined into one; it’s like the writers couldn’t flesh out either tale for an entire 22 minutes so they just stuck two half-programs together.\" He added that it still \"manages some laughs\", and also argued that the episode was very similar to the season 1 episode \"There's No Disgrace Like Home\", which was also noted by Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk. Despite receiving mixed reviews, \"Brawl in the Family\" is often considered a fan favourite, and R. L. Shaffer of IGN called it one of the season's \"gems\".\n\nThe episode title is a reference to the American TV show \"All In The Family\". The Simpsons sing Sister Sledge's 1979 hit song \"We Are Family\" as they are driving home from their victorious trip to the forest. After the Simpsons sing the song, Gabriel references the 1946 movie \"It's a Wonderful Life\" as he mentions earning his wings.\n\n"}

West Buckland was one of the first villages in the country to arrange such a facility. The village has a refurbished village hall, and a garage. There is no public house, but the village hall now has a licensed bar which is opened during a considerable number of social events throughout the year.\n\nThe village may be best known for having given its name to the adjacent co-educational independent West Buckland School: educators of, amongst others, England cricketer Harold Gimblett and British world record triple-jumper Jonathan Edwards. Despite taking the name, the school comprising its preparatory school, three boarding houses and the public school itself is located on an extensive campus about 1 km east of the village and instead it is the small parish church which draws most visitors from the local area. The daily school traffic includes a fleet of long coaches which pass through the narrow village street twice a day.\n\nPreviously, there was a thriving, annual four-day \"Festival of Music, Art and Entertainment\", which included both international and local performers, a very successful Art and Craft Exhibition and various workshops.\n\nWe regret to say that we no longer hold a Festival in the village.\n\n"}
{"id": "2143560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143560", "title": "Ky Fan inequality", "text": "Ky Fan inequality\n\nIn mathematics, there are two different results that share the common name of the Ky Fan inequality. One is an inequality involving the geometric mean and arithmetic mean of two sets of real numbers of the unit interval. The result was published on page 5 of the book \"Inequalities\" by Edwin F. Beckenbach and Richard E. Bellman (1961), who refer to an unpublished result of Ky Fan. They mention the result in connection with the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means and Augustin Louis Cauchy's proof of this inequality by forward-backward-induction; a method which can also be used to prove the Ky Fan inequality.\n\nThis Ky Fan inequality is a special case of Levinson's inequality and also the starting point for several generalizations and refinements; some of them are given in the references below.\n\nThe second Ky Fan inequality is used in game theory to investigate the existence of an equilibrium.\n\nIf \"x\" with 0 ≤ \"x\" ≤ formula_1 for \"i\" = 1, ..., \"n\" are real numbers, then\n\nwith equality if and only if \"x\" = \"x\" = . . . = \"x\".\n\nLet\n\ndenote the arithmetic and geometric mean, respectively, of \"x\", . . ., \"x\", and let\n\ndenote the arithmetic and geometric mean, respectively, of 1 − \"x\", . . ., 1 − \"x\". Then the Ky Fan inequality can be written as\n\nwhich shows the similarity to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means given by \"G\" ≤ \"A\".\n\nIf \"x\" ∈ [0,½] and \"γ\" ∈ [0,1] for \"i\" = 1, . . ., \"n\" are real numbers satisfying \"γ\" + . . . + \"γ\" = 1, then\n\nwith the convention 0 := 0. Equality holds if and only if either\n\nThe classical version corresponds to \"γ\" = 1/\"n\" for all \"i\" = 1, . . ., \"n\".\n\nIdea: Apply Jensen's inequality to the strictly concave function\n\nDetailed proof: (a) If at least one \"x\" is zero, then the left-hand side of the Ky Fan inequality is zero and the inequality is proved. Equality holds if and only if the right-hand side is also zero, which is the case when \"γx\" = 0 for all \"i\" = 1, . . ., \"n\".\n\n(b) Assume now that all \"x\" > 0. If there is an \"i\" with \"γ\" = 0, then the corresponding \"x\" > 0 has no effect on either side of the inequality, hence the \"i\" term can be omitted. Therefore, we may assume that \"γ\" > 0 for all \"i\" in the following. If \"x\" = \"x\" = . . . = \"x\", then equality holds. It remains to show strict inequality if not all \"x\" are equal.\n\nThe function \"f\" is strictly concave on (0,½], because we have for its second derivative\n\nUsing the functional equation for the natural logarithm and Jensen's inequality for the strictly concave \"f\", we obtain that\n\nwhere we used in the last step that the \"γ\" sum to one. Taking the exponential of both sides gives the Ky Fan inequality.\n\nA second inequality is also called the Ky Fan Inequality, because of a 1972 paper, \"A minimax inequality and its applications\". This second inequality is equivalent to the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem, but is often more convenient. Let \"S\" be a compact convex subset of a finite-dimensional vector space \"V\", and let formula_10 be a function from formula_11 to the real numbers that is lower semicontinuous in \"x\", concave in \"y\" and has formula_12 for all \"z\" in \"S\". Then there exists formula_13 such that formula_14 for all formula_15. This Ky Fan Inequality is used to establish the existence of equilibria in various games studied in economics.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "2143583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143583", "title": "Machine Man", "text": "Machine Man\n\nMachine Man (also known as Aaron Stack, Mister Machine and serial number Z2P45-9-X-51 or X-51 for short) is a fictional character, an android superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by Jack Kirby for \"\" #8 (July 1977), a comic written and drawn by Kirby featuring concepts based on the eponymous Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke . Shortly thereafter, Machine Man spun off into his own Kirby-created series. He is a robot, the only survivor of a series, raised as a human son of scientist Abel Stack, who was killed removing his auto-destruct mechanism, and further evolved to sentience by a Monolith.\n\nMachine Man originally appeared in the pages of \"\" #8 (July 1977), which was written and drawn by Jack Kirby, where he was called Mister Machine. He went on to appear in his own self-titled series in 1978.\n\nThis title featured Machine Man entering the mainstream Marvel Universe. Jack Kirby wrote and drew the first nine issues, which dealt with the title character's status as a fugitive from the military after the death of his creator, and his first interactions with mankind. The book was canceled at the end of 1978 with X-51 finally standing up to the military.\n\nMachine Man appeared next in a three issue story arc within the pages of \"The Incredible Hulk\" #235–237. The robot found himself battling the green giant within the suburban setting of his human friend, Dr. Peter Spaulding. By the end of the storyline, he incurred a complete system shutdown, leading to the events portrayed in his relaunched monthly series.\n\nThe title was relaunched in issue #10 after a nine-month hiatus. Status quo in the book changed with Machine Man now living amongst humanity, and dealing with his own new-found emotions. Marv Wolfman came aboard as the new writer, partnered with artist Steve Ditko, which helped set a different tone from Kirby's previous stories. Issue 15 saw a new writer, Tom DeFalco, taking over the writing chores. The title lasted until issue #19, ending in February 1980.\n\nIn October 1984 – January 1985, the \"Machine Man\" title was resurrected, in a four-issue miniseries written by Tom DeFalco with art by Herb Trimpe (breakdowns only, issues #1–3) and Barry Windsor-Smith (finishes only, issues #1–3 and full art for issue #4), with Windsor-Smith also coloring the entire miniseries and co-plotting issue #4 with DeFalco. This series turned out to be one of the most popular of all the Machine Man titles, tying with previous continuity, but with the action set in the distant cyberpunk future of 2020, starting with Machine Man's reassembly.\n\nThe miniseries was first reprinted as a 96-page trade paperback in 1988 (), with brand new cover art by Barry Windsor-Smith. The miniseries was republished again in 1994 as two double-size books, with the name \"Machine Man 2020\". Characters from this alternate future have made appearances in other Marvel books, namely Arno Stark, the mercenary Iron Man 2020. In 2013, many of Arno Stark’s adventures were collected in the \"Iron Man 2020\" TPB, which included all 4 issues of \"Machine Man\" volume 2.\n\nIn 1999, Marvel brought the character back in the series \"X-51, The Machine Man\" in which Machine Man experiences a programming malfunction: he would uncontrollably attack any mutant he encountered. He was given a drastically more robotic look and his powers were vastly changed. The reason for both was that he had been reconstructed by Sentinel-based nanotechnology. The series lasted twelve issues; in the final one, he was 'recovered' by a Celestial, as the Celestials—revealed to be the power behind the Monoliths—had become interested in Machine Man.\n\nMachine Man, whose real name is Z2P45-9-X-51, was the last of a series of sentient robots created at the Broadhurst Center for the Advancement of Mechanized Research in Central City, California, by robotics expert Dr. Abel Stack for the US Army. However, all previous 50 experimental robots went mad as they achieved sentience and became psychotic, due to a lack of identity. X-51 was the only survivor, as he was treated as a son by Stack and given a human face mask as well as being exposed to one of the monoliths from . After Stack died trying to protect him, X-51 assumed the human name Aaron Stack and escaped confinement, only to be relentlessly pursued by the army. X-51 named himself Mister Machine in issue #9 of the 10-issue run of \"2001\".\n\nWhile on the run, the newly christened Machine Man initiated contact with humanity in order to better understand it. After being captured and later freed, Machine Man was found by psychiatrist Peter Spaulding. He also battled Col. Krag's troops. Soon after that, he first encountered Curtiss Jackson. Alongside the Hulk, he battled Curtiss Jackson. Soon after that, he was redesigned and rebuilt by Dr. Oliver Broadhurst. He then first encountered the Fantastic Four. He then met mechanic \"Gears\" Garvin, and then battled Baron Brimstone. He also battled Madame Menace (Sunset Bain). He then first encountered Aurora, Northstar, and Sasquatch of Alpha Flight. Spaulding and Garvin set up Machine Man with a human identity as Aaron Stack, insurance investigator for the Delmar Insurance Company, but he continued having adventures as a superhero on the side.\n\nIn \"Iron Man\" #168 (March 1983), Machine Man attempts to pay Iron Man a visit. Machine Man was seeking to compare notes with Iron Man, thought to be a robot by Machine Man. At the time, Iron Man was drunk, irate, and under considerable stress from the machinations of Obadiah Stane. Iron Man attacked Machine Man and almost killed two of his own employees. At the last possible second, Machine Man's extendable arm pushed them out of the way.\n\nIn a meeting with the Thing of the Fantastic Four, Machine Man also first met and fell in love with another sentient robot, Jocasta. Alongside the Thing and Jocasta, he battled Ultron. However, during the battle, Machine Man witnessed the seeming destruction of Jocasta by Ultron.\n\nIn 1990, Machine Man guest-starred in \"Iron Man Annual\" #11 (part of the \"Terminus Factor\" storyline). That story created strong hints that the 2020 Machine Man may turn out not to be the true X-51, but instead a duplicate created by Sunset Bain. The story concludes in Thor Annual #15, also in 1990.\n\nHe later fought alongside the Avengers, which led to the invitation to become a team reservist. Later he was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., who wanted to use his technology to create another Deathlok. He helps the X-Men and Douglock against the villainous Red Skull, who had taken over the Helicarrier where Machine Man was held.\n\nHe helped the X-Men again against Bastion and his Sentinels. As a consequence, he was infected by Sentinel programming, assuming a more robotic look in the subsequent series \"X-51\", and losing self-control whenever he was faced with a mutant. During this series he was on the run from Sebastian Shaw, who wants his technology for himself. Because of his new programming, while seeking aid from the Avengers, he attacks Justice and Firestar. Because of his actions against Justice and Firestar, X-51's membership in the Avengers is revoked. At the end of \"X-51\", X-51 encountered one of the monoliths and disappeared, brought into the presence of the monolith's creators, the cosmic beings known as the Celestials.\n\nWarren Ellis and Stuart Immonen's \"Nextwave\" series sees Machine Man join a team formed by the Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort, or H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the Beyond Corporation©) to fight Unusual Weapons of Mass Destruction. Now preferring simply to be called Aaron, Machine Man is partnered with Monica Rambeau, Tabitha Smith, Elsa Bloodstone, and The Captain, and the team soon discovers that H.A.T.E. are funded by the Beyond Corporation©, leading them to go rogue and carry out their mission on their own prerogative.\nCalling humans \"fleshy ones\" and expressing a degree of pride in his \"roboty parts\" — which he uses to kill Fin Fang Foom — Aaron has developed a fondness for alcohol, stating \"My robot brain needs beer\" on regular occasions. He is not especially popular with his teammates because of his self-important attitude, and, as is learned in a flashback that after being brought to space by the Celestials at the conclusion of his previous series, he was dumped back on Earth because the space-gods considered him to be a \"complete and utter ☠☠☠☠.\" (\"☠☠☠☠\" representing an unspecified, but extremely offensive, profanity throughout the Nextwave series) He appears to have a rather serious attraction to Elsa Bloodstone and stares at her chest constantly, much to her chagrin.\n\nIt is revealed that, when still an agent of H.A.T.E, Aaron would often sneak into Dirk Anger's room to steal beer until he found out what Anger made it out of (\"I thought \"Lizard Squeezings\" was a brewery name.\"). He later uses his knowledge of Dirk's quarters to steal Anger's mother's dress and hold it hostage in exchange for the safe escape of Nextwave.\n\nLater appearances in the \"Marvel Comics Presents\" mini-series (vol.2) suggest that X-51's memories of his time with the Celestials may be skewed, as he experienced visual hallucinations (?) of a miniature Celestial helping him overcome his psychological issues.\n\nMachine Man appears in a flashback to \"Iron Man\" (vol. 1) #168 (March 1983) in \"Iron Man/Captain America: Casualties of War\". In trying to convince Captain America of the rightness of his position, Iron Man tells of the time Machine Man came to visit him. Machine Man was seeking to compare notes with Iron Man, thought to be a robot by Machine Man. Drunk, irate, and under considerable stress from the machinations of Obadiah Stane, Iron Man attacks Machine Man and almost kills two of his own employees. At the last possible second, Machine Man's extendable arm pushes them out of the way. Iron Man uses this incident as the need for accountability in the superhero population.\n\nAaron and Sleepwalker are recruited to aid Ms. Marvel in finding her teammate Araña as part of a S.H.I.E.L.D. strikeforce known as Operation Lightning Storm. In the promotional cover for this appearance, he is in the costume which he wore during \"Nextwave\". His appearance is entirely in keeping with Nextwave: he wears the same costume and displays the same nonsensical and zany personality developed, in place of his previous logical and friendly self. He reveals that Agent Maria Hill from S.H.I.E.L.D. offered him financial compensation to join the Initiative, enraging Ms. Marvel, who had supported it from the beginning, for free. He spends much of his time in Chile and aboard the Minicarrier 13, Ms. Marvel's headquarters at the time, antagonizing and criticizing every available agent.\n\nIn addition to financial compensation, S.H.I.E.L.D. has also provided Aaron with a Life Model Decoy of Monica Rambeau, which is programmed to cry for him. Keeping him in his new role of comic relief, Aaron has been shown using the LMD body as a replacement part for his damaged body, going so far to offer \"womanly advice\" to a deeply shocked Araña.\n\nMachine Man appears twice in the \"Marvel Zombies\" universe, initially in a cameo as part of the Nextwave team who engage in battle against the infected heroes and are killed off panel in \"Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness\", and as the main character in \"Marvel Zombies 3\". As the main character, Machine Man accepts an assignment on behalf of A.R.M.O.R. to accompany Jocasta to retrieve a blood sample from a living human from the \"Marvel Zombies\" universe, and the two are transported there by Portal. At first he wants to complete his mission only for the money, until he discovers that the zombies are cloning humans for food, much as humans use his fellow robots only for their own needs. He obtains cell samples from the Kingpin's wife Vanessa, who is still alive and being kept safe by the Kingpin. Machine Man delivers the samples to Jocasta, but the zombies nearly destroy him in retribution, and Portal and Jocasta are forced to leave his ruined body in that dimension. After Machine Man reveals that it was a holographic projection of himself, he fights off some zombies and captures the zombie Lockjaw who he uses to teleport back to his own dimension. Disposing of the remaining zombies within the facility, Machine Man and Jocasta are assigned back to S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nHe retains his personality as displayed in \"Nextwave\" and \"Ms Marvel\" in this series, however when Jocasta describes him as different from the person she once knew, he gives an explanation. Describing his earlier, friendly personality as being linked to \"unresolved Oedipal issues\", he claims to have grown tired of saving people over and over again to earn their love, as he loved them. Since that never happened (he claims), he has \"modeled myself after the fleshies now. I look out for Number One, just like them\". However, at the end of the series, as he wipes out the last remaining zombies, he declares, \"No, you know what? My name is Machine Man and I just saved the ☠☠☠☠ing world!\" accepting the name he spent much of \"Nextwave\" and this series denying.\n\nIn \"Marvel Zombies 5\", he teams up with Howard the Duck. They later work with and befriend Jacali Kane, daughter of an alternate-universe Hurricane. The trio travel the multi-verse fighting zombies; their intentions are to gather samples from biologically differing zombies in other to gain a cure. He is dismayed by Jocasta's decision to marry Ultron.\n\nUnder orders from Captain Steve Rogers, Machine Man teams up with Red Hulk, who is tracking down a Qatari rebel named Dagan Shah (whom Red Hulk believed to be behind the death of his old friend Will Krugauer). Machine Man and Red Hulk arrive in Sharzhad where they find Dagan Shah in the disguise of Arabian Knight, who lets them through the force field and leads them to his palace. Once inside the palace, Dagan Shah sheds his disguise, reveals his true identity as the Sultan Magus, and imprisons Red Hulk and Machine Man, as it is shown that the real Arabian Knight is imprisoned in a crystal. Red Hulk and Machine Man escape when Sultan Magus travels to Cairo after probing Red Hulk's mind to find out who could have sent Red Hulk to Sharzhad. Machine Man reveals to Red Hulk that Sultan Magus has used Rigellian technology to manipulate hydrogen, which involved providing a supply of water and terraforming a part of the desert for Sharzhad. When Sultan Magus returns, he attacks Red Hulk and Machine Man. Sultan Magus rips Machine Man in half. When Arabian Knight is freed from his imprisonment, Red Hulk and Machine Man continue their fight with Sultan Magus until General Reginald Fortean arrives and ends the fight. Fortean states to Red Hulk and Machine Man that Sharzhad has been recognized as a nation by the Arab League upon Sultan Magus agreeing to stop the weapons trading and states that they are trespassing. Sultan Magus then orders Red Hulk and Machine Man to get out of Sharzhad while he secretly plans to have his revenge on Red Hulk someday.\n\nFollowing an altercation with Red She-Hulk, Machine Man and Red Hulk track Zero/One to her floating island base Ogygia. As Red Hulk and Machine Man are fighting Zero/One's genetically-engineered sea monsters, Zero/One sends Black Fog to fight Machine Man and Red Hulk. Using a device given to him by Jacob Feinman, Machine Man disables Zero/One's drones and frees Black Fog from Zero/One's control as Black Fog leaves the area, stating that his debt is paid.\n\nMachine Man and Red Hulk arrived in Hawaii to fight a genetically-engineered Hydra that was created by Zero/One.\n\nAs part of the 2016 \"Marvel NOW!\", Machine Man appeared as an employee of Umbral Dynamics. Machine Man later appears as a member of Domino's incarnation of the Mercs for Money.\n\nDuring the \"Iron Man 2020\" event, Machine Man appears as a member of the A.I. Army. Machine Man was assigned to blow up the satellite dish on Baintronics only for his feelings towards a reprogrammed Jocasata to get in the way. He followed her to a Baintronics facility and fought through many of the X-series robots that came before him. When he finally catches up to Jocasta, he is taken down by a new X-series robot model named X-52. Despite being at a disadvantage, Machine Man defeated X-52 and beheaded Jocasta while making off with her still-active head. Though he ran into a Baintronics security personnel as he prepares to fight them.\n\nMachine Man was constructed by unnamed computer engineering specialists under Dr. Oliver Broadhurst at the Broadhurst Center for the Advancement of Mechanized Research; Dr. Abel Stack was his chief programmer. Machine Man's robotic materials, design, and construction (titanium alloy) provide him with a number of abilities, as does his adamantium composition. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and reflexes. He is an expert on his own construction and repair. Machine Man has superhuman visual acuity. He possesses an above normal intellect, with a capacity for unlimited self-motivated activity, creative intelligence, and human-like emotions. He has superhuman cybernetic analytical capabilities, including the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy.\n\nMachine Man is powered by solar energy. He can also draw power from several different external-energy sources, if needed. Machine Man has the ability to telescope his arms and legs to a length of . Machine Man's hands are equipped with variable-payload fingers, some routinely carried in his fingers, others stored in hidden recesses in his belt. His fingers contain a different variety of devices, including: gas chromatograph, laser interferometer, micro-pulse radar, audiometer, seismometer, gravity-wave detector, pulse-code modulator, standard-computer input/outputs, radio beacon, all-wave transceiver, laser-cutting torch/weapon, and projection of heat, cold, or electricity; one of his fingers has been shown to contain a bullet-firing mechanism that uses .357 Magnum ammunition. He has the ability of flight under his own power through the means of anti-gravity disks.\n\nDuring the \"X-51\" series, Machine Man had a few extra features thanks to nanotechnology within him at the time. This mainly included parts of himself being rebuilt if damaged, also causing many changes in his look from issue to issue. He also had a beam cannon on his chest.\n\nIn \"Nextwave\", he has become a living Swiss Army knife of sorts, containing various tools and weapons for a multitude of situations, both useful and esoteric. When asked if he could impregnate a human woman from several feet away, Aaron simply states \"I am full of very useful devices.\"\n\nIn the \"Point One\" event, as many other heroes, Machine Man was slightly revamped, gaining new powers and abilities. Now being a cross between the nano-technlogical being in the \"X-51\" miniseries and the living Swiss Army knife of \"Nextwave\", Machine Man is now suffused with nanites able to effortlessly change his appearance from his earliest, jump-suited look to the more-humanoid looks of Nextwave. Also, his nanotechnology allows him to transform and rebuild every piece of machinery he comes in contact with, such as building an anti-gravity vehicle out of a motorcycle.\n\nIn \"Nextwave\" #10, Forbush Man forces each member of Nextwave to experience life in 'Forbush Vision'; they were cursed to suffer in a boring or mundane personal hell. Aaron's nightmare was life as an insurance adjuster for Delmar Insurance in Central City, USA. Bashing his head into a personal computer several times out of depression, he decapitates himself...only to answer the phone a moment later. Stack is freed from the nightmare by the intervention of fellow Nextwave member Tabitha Smith.\n\nMachine Man was also one of the main characters of the Earth X trilogy. Transformed by a monolith into a transparent version of himself, Aaron was forced to become the new Watcher by a blind Uatu, the previous Watcher, who had not viewed any event on the planet for 20 years. Tricking Uatu, who had attempted to force Machine Man to reject his humanity, Machine Man managed to use his access to Watcher technology and data to help humanity defeat the coming Celestials, by revealing to Earth's superhero community the true origins of mankind. After defeating the Celestials, Machine Man used his newfound position to contact parallel Earths to help them eradicate the Celestial menace.\n\nAside from his mainstream version having traveled to this universe, Machine Man and his Nextwave counterparts are also a team in this reality; they are destroyed off-panel by the zombie Power Pack. The classic version of Machine Man also appears in \"Marvel Zombies Dead Days\" in the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. He is part of a last-ditch super-team gathered to fight the zombies.\n\nMachine Man was reactivated in the year 2020 by a group of outlaw scavengers called Midnight Wreckers (led by X-51's old friend Gears Garvin), and forced to battle his old enemy, the industrialist ice queen Sunset Bain, as well as mercenary Arno Stark, the amoral Iron Man of 2020.\n\nIn \"Paradise X: Heralds\" #1, Iron Man 2020 claimed to the Earth X Machine Man that he had killed Machine Man 2020, despite the miniseries clearly depicting Arno Stark's decisive defeat at Machine Man's hands. (The Earth X universe is a separate continuity from the mainstream Marvel Universe.)\n\nWhen Morgan le Fay restructured reality in volume three of \"Avengers\" #1–3, nearly all Avengers, past and present, were transformed into the Queen's Vengeance, a sort of medieval-themed Avengers. Machine Man became Sir MacHinery, an obvious play on the word machinery. He can be seen on the cover of issue #2, behind Hercules.\n\nThe Ultimate Marvel version of Machine Man is Danny Ketch, who sacrificed his life during Galactus' assault on Earth. Danny Ketch's consciousness is later revealed to have survived inside a robotic body formed from salvaged Gah Lak Tus tech and is dubbed \"Machine Man\" by Phil Coulson.\n\nIn the \"Spider-Man Unlimited\" animated TV series, the Machine Men (all voiced by Dale Wilson) serve as the High Evolutionary's enforcers on Counter-Earth. Spider-Man saved a Machine Man named X-51 from disassembly in the episode \"Steel Cold Heart\" and he joined forces with Spider-Man and the Human Rebels in their struggle against the High Evolutionary's regime. This robot is one of a group of Machine Men, who switches sides after not wanting to be scrapped following serious damage in a battle. The design of these Machine Men is somewhat reminiscent of the original Machine Man, especially in terms of color and abilities. However, they are substantially bulkier than Machine Man's human sized physique, drawing inspiration from the design of the Sentinels from \"X-Men\" comics or animated series..\n\nDespite the appearance of Nextwave characters in other Marvel titles, in 2006 Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada stated that Nextwave's setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity. However, recent issues of \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\", as well as \"Civil War: Battle Damage Report\", consistently place Nextwave's activities in mainstream continuity. As noted above, subsequent appearances by Stack have used the Nextwave portrayal.\n\n"}

It occupies total area of about 130 square km. Its highest peak is 2,087 metres. \n\nThe plateau is roughly pear-shaped. The southern portion is known as Zomba Mountain, and the northern portion as Malosa. The deeply incised Domasi Valley runs east and west between the two.. \n\nThe plateau largely made up of granitic syenite, an igneous rock that intruded into the older metamorphic rocks that make up the highlands during the late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods 150-65 million years ago. The Mulanje Massif to the southeast is of similar composition and origin. Precious and semi-precious stones such as quartz can be found.\n\nThe Zomba and Malosa forest reserves were established in 1913. Most of the plateau is covered with plantations of Mexican pine trees \"(Pinus patula)\". Small patches of native montane forest and miombo woodland remain. The pines were planted for timber production for the Zomba Sawmill, which is located at the southern slopes of the mountain. Where indigenous trees are left, severe deforestation due to the high demand for firewood in the region is a problem. Fruits like strawberries, yellow-berries and blackberries are grown on the mountain for the local market.\n\nThe Zomba Plateau is the region's major tourist attraction. Activities offered include hiking, horse riding, rock-climbing, fishing and mountain-biking. A paved all-weather road leads from Zomba on the plateau. The massif hosts several accommodations for tourists, such as the Sunbird KuChawe Inn and several camping grounds. Additionally, several companies and institutions, such as the CCAP Church, as well as private persons have cottages on the plateau.\n\nOn clear days, Blantyre and the Mulanje Massif, which are both about 60 km away, can be seen. From the western edge of the plateau, Shire River and Liwonde National Park can be seen. \n\nIn 2000, the Mulunguzi Dam was opened, which serves as a water reservoir for the City of Zomba. \n"}

They are also called liberins () and statins () (respectively), or releasing factors and inhibiting factors. The examples are hypothalamic-pituitary hormones that can be classified from several viewpoints: they are hypothalamic hormones (originating in the hypothalamus), they are hypophysiotropic hormones (affecting the hypophysis, that is, the pituitary gland), and they are tropic hormones (having other endocrine glands as their target). \n\nFor example, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is released from the hypothalamus in response to low levels of secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland. The TSH in turn is under feedback control by the thyroid hormones T4 and T3. When the level of TSH is too high, they feed back on the brain to shut down the secretion of TRH. Synthetic TRH is also used by physicians as a test of TSH reserve in the pituitary gland as it should stimulate the release of TSH and prolactin from this gland.\n\nThe main releasing hormones are as follows:\n\n\nThe main release-inhibiting hormones or inhibiting hormones are as follows: \n\n\nThere are various other inhibiting factors that also have tropic endocrine inhibition activity. Such activity is only one of many functions that they have (such as neurotransmitter and receptor antagonist roles), and they are not always called hormones, although many are neuropeptides or neurosteroids. They include the following:\n\n\nExamples of releasing and inhibiting hormones for exocrine hormones are gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), which regulate gastrin production.\n\nReleasing hormones increase (or, in case of inhibitory factors, decrease) the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca), resulting in vesicle fusion of the respective primary hormone. \n\nFor GnRH, TRH and GHRH the increase in Ca is achieved by the releasing hormone coupling and activating G protein coupled receptors coupled to the G alpha subunit, activating the IP3/DAG pathway to increase Ca. For GHRH, however, this is a minor pathway, the main one being the cAMP dependent pathway. \n\nRoger Guillemin and Andrew W. Schally were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1977 for their contributions to understanding \"the peptide hormone production of the brain\"; these scientists independently first isolated TRH and GnRH and then identified their structures.\n\n"}

On his father's transfer to Berlin as director of the mint, the boy was sent to the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium there; his brilliant talents, however, did not develop until later, when at the University of Königsberg he fell under the influence of Immanuel Kant. Though his intellect was sharpened and his zeal for learning quickened by the great thinker's influence, Kant's categorical imperative did not prevent him from yielding to the taste for wine, women and gambling, which pursued him through life. When in 1785 he returned to Berlin, he received the appointment of secretary to the royal \"Generaldirectorium\", his talents soon gaining him promotion to the rank of councillor for war (\"Kriegsrath\"). During an illness, which kept him virtuous by confining him to his room, he studied French and English, gaining a mastery of these languages, which opened up for him opportunities for a diplomatic career.\n\nHis interest in public affairs was, however, first aroused by the outbreak of the French Revolution. Like most quick-witted young men, he greeted it at first with enthusiasm, but its subsequent developments cooled his ardour and he was converted to more conservative views by Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\", the translation of which into German (1794) was his first literary venture. This was followed, the next year, by translations of works on the Revolution by Mallet du Pan and Mounier, and he also founded and edited a monthly journal, the \"Neue deutsche Monatsschrift\" in which, for five years he wrote, mainly on historical and political questions. He maintained the principles of British constitutionalism against those of revolutionary France. The knowledge that he displayed of the principles and practice of finance was especially remarkable. In 1797, at the instance of English statesmen, he published a translation of a history of French finance by Francois Divernois (1757–1842), an eminent Genevese exile naturalized and knighted in England, extracts from which he had previously given in his journal. His literary output, all inspired by a moderate liberalism, was astounding, and it included an essay on the results of the discovery of the Americas, and another, written in French, on the English financial system (\"Essai sur l'état de l'administration des finances de la Grande-Bretagne\", London, 1800). Especially noteworthy, however, was the \"Denkschrift\" or \"Memorandum\" he addressed to King Frederick William III on his accession (1797), in which, \"inter alia\", he urged upon the king the necessity for granting freedom to the press and to commerce. For a Prussian official to venture to give uncalled-for advice to his sovereign was a breach of propriety not calculated to increase his chances of favour, but it gave Gentz a conspicuous position in the public eye, which his brilliant talents and literary style enabled him to maintain. Moreover, he was from the first aware of the probable developments of the Revolution and of the consequences to Prussia of the weakness and vacillations of her policy.\n\nOpposition to France was the inspiring principle of the \"Historisches Journal\" founded by him in 1799 and 1800, which once more held up English institutions as the model, and he became in Germany the mouthpiece of British policy towards the revolutionary aggressions of the French Republic. In 1801, he ceased the publication of the \"Journal\" because he disliked the regularity of journalism. He issued instead, under the title \"Beiträge zur Geschichte\", etc., a series of essays on contemporary politics. The first was \"Über den Ursprung und Charakter des Krieges gegen die französische Revolution\" (1801), regarded by many as Gentz's masterpiece; another important brochure, \"Von dem politischen Zustande von Europa vor und nach der Revolution\", a criticism of Hauterive's \"De l’ėtat de la France de la fin de l’an VIII\", appeared the same year.\n\nHe gained recognition abroad and gifts of money from the British and Austrian governments, but it made his position as an official in Berlin impossible, as the Prussian government had no mind to abandon its attitude of cautious neutrality. Private affairs also combined to urge Gentz to leave the Prussian service; mainly through his own fault, a separation with his wife was arranged. In May 1802, accordingly, he took leave of his wife and left with his friend Adam Müller for Vienna. In Berlin, he had been intimate with the Austrian ambassador, Count Stadion, whose good offices procured him an introduction to the Emperor Francis. The immediate result was the title of imperial councillor, with a yearly salary of 4000 gulden (6 December 1802), but it was not until 1809 that he was actively employed. Before returning to Berlin to make arrangements for transferring himself finally to Vienna, Gentz paid a visit to London, where he made the acquaintance of Pitt and Grenville, who were so impressed with his talents that in addition to large money presents, he was guaranteed an annual pension by the British government in recognition of the value of the services of his pen against Napoleon Bonaparte. From then on, he was engaged in a ceaseless polemic against every fresh advance of Napoleonic power and pretensions. With matchless sarcasm he lashed the nerveless policy of courts that suffered indignity with resignation. He denounced the recognition of Napoleon's imperial title and drew up a manifesto of Louis XVIII against it. The formation of the coalition and the outbreak of war, for a while, raised his hopes despite his lively distrust of the competence of Austrian ministers. Hopes were speedily dashed by the Battle of Austerlitz and its results. Gentz used his enforced leisure to write a brilliant essay on \"The relations between England and Spain before the outbreak of war between the two powers\" (Leipzig, 1806). Shortly afterwards appeared \"Fragmente aus der neuesten Geschichte des politischen Gleichgewichts in Europa\" (translated as \"Fragments on the Balance of Power in Europe\", London, 1806). The last of Gentz's works as an independent publicist, it was a masterly \"exposé\" of the actual political situation and was also prophetic in its suggestions as to how this should be retrieved: \"Through Germany Europe has perished; through Germany it must rise again\".\n\nHe realized that the dominance of France could not be broken but by the union of Austria and Prussia, acting in concert with Britain. He watched with interest the Prussian military preparations. At the invitation of Count Haugwitz, he went at the outset of the campaign to the Prussian headquarters at Erfurt, where he drafted the king's proclamation and his letter to Napoleon. The writer was known, and it was in this connection that Napoleon referred to him as a \"wretched scribe named Gentz, one of those men without honour who sell themselves for money\". Gentz had no official mandate from the Austrian government, and whatever hopes he may have cherished of privately influencing the situation in the direction of an alliance between the two German powers were speedily dashed by the Battle of Jena.\n\nThe downfall of Prussia left Austria the sole hope of Germany and of Europe. Gentz, who from the winter of 1806 onwards divided his time between Prague and the Bohemian watering places, seemed to devote himself wholly to the pleasures of society, his fascinating personality gaining him a ready reception in those exalted circles that were to prove of use to him later on in Vienna. However, though he published nothing, his pen was not idle, and he was occupied with a series of essays on the future of Austria and the best means of liberating Germany and redressing the balance of Europe, but he himself confessed to his friend Müller (4 August 1806) that in the miserable circumstances of the time, his essay on the principles of a general pacification must be taken as a political poem.\n\nIn 1809, on the outbreak of war between Austria and France, Gentz was for the first time actively employed by the Austrian government under Stadion. He drafted the proclamation announcing the declaration of war (15 April) and during the continuance of hostilities his pen was ceaselessly employed. The peace of 1810 and the fall of Stadion once more dashed his hopes and, disillusioned and hellishly blasé, he once more retired to comparative inactivity at Prague. Of Metternich, Stadion's successor, he had at the outset no high opinion, and it was not until 1812 that the two men had close relations that were to ripen into lifelong friendship. However, when Gentz returned to Vienna as Metternich's adviser, he was no longer the fiery patriot who had sympathized and corresponded with Stein in the darkest days of German depression and, in fiery periods, called upon all Europe to free itself from foreign rule. Disillusioned and cynical but clear-sighted as ever, he was henceforth before all things an Austrian, more Austrian, on occasion even than Metternich.\n\nDuring the final stages of the campaign of 1814, he expressed the hope that Metternich would substitute Austria for Europe in his diplomacy and, despite his opposition to Napoleon and of France, secure an Austro-French alliance by maintaining the husband of Marie Louise on the throne of France.\n\nFor ten years, from 1812 onward, Gentz was in close touch with all the great affairs of European history, the assistant, confidant and adviser of Metternich. He accompanied the chancellor on all his journeys and was present at all the conferences that preceded and followed the war. No political secrets were hidden from him, and his hand drafted all important diplomatic documents. He was secretary to the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815) and to all the congresses and conferences that followed until the Conference of Verona (1822); his vast knowledge of men and affairs made him a power. He was under no illusion as to their achievements, and his memoir on the work of the congress of Vienna is at once an incisive piece of criticism and a monument of his own disillusionment.\n\nHowever, the liberalism of his early years was gone forever, and he had become reconciled to Metternich's view that in an age of decay, the sole function of a statesman was to prop up mouldering institutions. It was the hand of the author of that offensive \"Memorandum\" to Frederick William III on the freedom of the press that drafted the Carlsbad Decrees. It was he who inspired the policy of repressing the freedom of the universities, and he noted in his diary as a day more important than that of Leipzig the session of the Vienna conference of 1819, which decided to make the convocation of representative assemblies in the German states impossible, by enforcing the letter of Article XIII of the Act of Confederation.\n\nIn private life, Gentz remained to the last a man of the world, but he was tormented with an exaggerated terror of death. He never saw his wife again since their parting at Berlin, and his relations with other women, mostly of the highest rank, were too numerous to record. However, passion tormented him to the end, and his infatuation for Fanny Elssler, the celebrated \"danseuse\", forms the subject of some remarkable letters to his friend Rahel, the wife of Varnhagen von Ense (1830–1831).\n\nHe died in Vienna in 1832.\n\nGentz has been described as a mercenary of the pen, and no other such mercenary has ever carved out for himself a more remarkable career. To have done so would have been impossible, in spite of his brilliant gifts, had he been no more than the \"wretched scribe\" sneered at by Napoleon. Though by birth, he belonged to the middle class in a country of hide-bound aristocracy, he lived to move on equal terms in the society of princes and statesmen, which would never have been the case had he been notoriously bought and sold. Yet that he was in the habit of receiving gifts from all and sundry who hoped for his backing is beyond dispute. He notes that at the Congress of Vienna he received £22,000 through Talleyrand from Louis XVIII, while Castlereagh gave him £600, accompanied by \"les plus folles promesses\"; his diary is full of such entries. Yet he never made any secret of these gifts. Metternich was aware of them, and he never suspected Gentz of writing or acting in consequence against his convictions. As a matter of fact, no man was more free or outspoken in his criticism of the policy of his employers than this apparently venal writer. The gifts and pensions were rather in the nature of subsidies than bribes. They were the recognition by various powers of the value of an ally whose pen had proved itself so potent a weapon in their cause.\n\nIt is, indeed, the very impartiality and objectivity of his attitude that make the writings of Gentz such illuminating documents for the period of history which they cover. Allowance must of course be made for his point of view but less so perhaps than in the case of any other writer so intimately concerned with the policies which he criticizes. Apart from their value as historical documents, Gentz's writings are literary monuments, classic examples of nervous and luminous German prose and of French as a model for diplomatic style.\n\n\n\n"}

His father, Gerardo Chiumiento, was a power tool salesman and plied his trade in Canada, Saudi Arabia and Japan before returning to his home country with his son. \n\nChiumiento began his career in 2004 at Juventus and quickly made an impressive name for himself at the club on his debut coming on as a substitute against Ancona at the age of 19. Chiumiento also played alongside his childhood hero Alessandro Del Piero, stating after the match \"\"This was my dream\"\".\n\nIn 2004, he was loaned out to Serie B club Siena to gain more experience. Chiumiento broke into the first-team with 14 apps and contributed to the second division side's promotion.\nThe following year he was loaned out to French side Le Mans playing 27 Ligue 1 matches scoring one goal. In 2006, he was loaned out to Swiss club BSC Young Boys. After his performances in the Swiss Super League, FC Lucerne showed interest in the player and signed him the following year.\n\nChiumiento signed a three-year contract with FC Luzern in the summer of 2007, for €150,000 transfer fee. Chiumiento scored his first goal for Luzern against FC Basel. Chiumiento scored his first hat-trick against FC Aarau; the match ended 6–0.\n\nChiumiento signed with Vancouver Whitecaps of the USSF Division 2 Professional League in 2010. He made his USSFD2 debut for Vancouver on 24 September 2010 in a 1–0 loss to Montreal Impact. He signed an MLS contract with the club on 8 March 2011. Chiumiento made his Major League Soccer debut for the Whitecaps on 19 March 2011 against Toronto FC, assisting on two goals in a 4–2 win. He scored only two goals in his time with the Whitecaps, a botched cross against the San Jose Earthquakes on 11 May. His second goal was a cutback by Camilo where he chipped the ball up, spun 360 degrees, and went bar down with his right foot. It was a candidate for MLS Goal of the Year.\n\nOn 11 July 2012, Chiumiento was transferred to FC Zürich for an undisclosed fee. He scored his first goal on 19 August, putting it bottom right, making it 1–1 against Servette FC. He won the 2013–14 Swiss Cup and 2015–16 Swiss Cup with Zürich. In June 2017 his contract was not renewed.\n\nChiumiento was called up as a replacement for Johann Lonfat in Switzerland's UEFA Euro 2004 squad. However, he turned the call-up down as he still had hope of appearing for Italy.\n\nIn February 2010, Chiumiento decided to play for Switzerland and made his first appearance for the Swiss national neam in a friendly match against Uruguay after having declined many call-ups. Although his dream was to play for Italy he decided he would play for Switzerland as he has a chance to be a regular in the starting team. Chiumiento was not chosen for the Swiss 2010 FIFA World Cup squad.\n\nChiumiento is referred to as the Swiss Ronaldinho although he idolizes Alessandro Del Piero. He is recognized for his pace, dribbling skills, and playmaking ability. Chiumiento plays preferably as a central attacking midfielder, but can play on both wings, or as a second striker.\n\nDavide attended Heiden Primary School in his hometown before moving to Turin, Italy, to attend Scuola Privata Athenaeum. He has a mother, Manuela Chiumiento, and an older brother, Claudio Chiumiento. Davide is fluent in four languages, English, French, Italian, and German. These have all helped him have a successful career in many countries. Davide had a great friendship with former FC Zurich striker, Eric Hassli, in his time in Vancouver, not just off the field, but on it, as many Hassli's goals were set up or created by Chiumiento. Davide was Hassli's best man at his wedding right before he transferred to FC Zurich.

{"id": "2143619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143619", "title": "Giovanni Battista Doni", "text": "Giovanni Battista Doni\n\nGiovanni Battista Doni (bap. 13 March 1595 – 1647) was an Italian musicologist and humanist who made an extensive study of ancient music. He is known, among other works, for having renamed the note \"Ut\" to \"Do\" (in the \"Do Re Mi ...\" solfège scale).\n\nIn his day, he was a well-known lawyer, classical scholar, critic and musical theorist, and from 1640 to 1647 he occupied the \"Chair of Eloquence\" at the University of Florence and was a prominent member of the city's Accademia della Crusca, one of the early semi-scientific/academic societies that flourished in Italy at the time. They had published the first Italian-language dictionary in 1612.\n\nBorn in Florence, he studied Greek, rhetoric, poetry and philosophy at the Universities of Florence and Bologna and both mathematics and jurisprudence at the University of Rome. Later he studied jurisprudence at Bourges in France and it is claimed that he worked for some time with the famous legal scholar Jacques Cujas who was a prominent member of the legal humanists or \"mos gallicus\" school (a French approach to historical law studies). However, since Cujas died a few years before Giovanni Doni's birth, this seems to be unlikely; however he probably did study under the legal humanists as the University of Bourges. (See also Cujas Library)\n\nThis approach to legal studies was admired during the early French revolutionary period because it emphasised the importance of early Roman law, rather than the pretensions of French kings.\n\nDoni received the degree of \"doctor\" from the University of Pisa and was chosen to accompany Neri Corsini (1614-1678) to Paris in 1621 where he became acquainted with Marin Mersenne and other literary persons. The Florentine Corsini family became important contacts in Doni's life: Neri Corsini became a cardinal in 1664 (Don't confuse with Neri Maria Corsini who became Cardinal in 1730, the year that Lorenzo Corsini became Pope Clement XII.) This was a period where the top religious orders were part of a culture of nepotism, and Doni attached himself to these religious dynasties.\n\nOn returning to Florence in 1622, Doni entered the service of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, and moved with him to Rome where Barberini became Dean of the College of Cardinals. Barberini was the elder brother of Cardinal Antonio Barberini, and the nephew of Maffeo Barberini who became Pope Urban VIII. He had studied at the University of Pisa where he was assisted by the family friend Galileo Galilei. Later in 1633 Barberini served with the Inquisition tribunal investigating Galileo, but was one of three members of the tribunal who refused to condemn Galileo.\n\nDoni later accompanied the cardinal who was a special legate sent to Cardinal Richelieu to Paris, and then in 1625 to Madrid (papal legate), and back to Rome (1626). Doni made good use of the opportunities that arose from these journeys to acquire substantial knowledge of ancient music. Among other things, he either invented or reconstructed, a \"double lyre\" which, in honour of his patron, he called a \"Lyra Barberina\" or \"Amphichord\" (see \"barbiton\").\n\nGiovanni returned to Florence once again (around 1640), where he married and settled down as professor at the university where he continued his studies of ancient music and music theory. Opera had been invented in Florence, and Vincenzo Galilei, the father of Galileo, was a key member of the group which established the new approach to theatre, and also an experimenter with acoustic laws and harmonies. Under guidance from Doni, Cardinal Barberini, was encouraged to venture into the production of an ancient version of opera.\n\nHe died only seven years after returning for Florence. Doni's main contribution to the world of letters was the study of classic musical theory as it existed in antiquity. Between 1635 and 1639 he wrote a Treatise on Music for the Theatre (\"Trattato della musica scenica\") which provides important history details for early opera.\n\nIn the eleventh century, the music theorist Guido of Arezzo developed a six-note ascending scale that went as follows: \"ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la\", and named the Aretinian syllables after him. The names were taken from the first verse of the Latin hymn \"Ut queant laxis\", where the syllables fall on their corresponding scale degree.\n\nGiovanni Doni is known for having changed the name of note \"Ut\" (C), renaming it \"Do\" (in the \"Do Re Mi ...\" sequence known as solfège). He convinced his contemporaries to make the change by arguing that 1) \"Do\" is easier to pronounce than \"Ut,\" and 2) \"Do\" is an abbreviation for \"Dominus,\" the Latin word for The Lord, who is the tonic and root of the world. There is much academic speculation that Giovanni Doni also wanted to imprint himself into musical canon in perpetuity because \"Do\" is also ulteriorly an abbreviation for his family name.\n\nA seventh note, \"Si\" (from the initials for \"Sancta Iohannes,\" Latin for St. John the Baptist) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale. In Anglophone countries, \"Si\" was changed to \"Ti\" by Sarah Glover in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might begin with a different letter. \"Ti\" is used in tonic sol-fa and in the song \"Do-Re-Mi\".\n\n\n"}

Water-meadows were mainly used in Europe from the 16th to the early 20th centuries. Working water-meadows have now largely disappeared, but the field patterns and water channels of derelict water-meadows remain common in areas where they were used, such as parts of Northern Italy, Switzerland and England. Derelict water-meadows are often of importance as wetland wildlife habitats.\n\nWater-meadows should not be confused with flood-meadows, which are naturally covered in shallow water by seasonal flooding from a river. \"Water-meadow\" is sometimes used more loosely to mean any level grassland beside a river.\n\nTwo main types of water-meadow were used.\n\nThese were used for fields on slopes, and relatively little engineering skill was required to construct them. Water from a stream or spring was fed to the top of a sloping field, and gentle sloping terraces were formed along which the water could trickle in a zig-zag fashion down the field. The water could be used again for fields lower down the slope.\n\n\"Bedwork\" or \"floated\" water-meadows were built on almost-level fields along broad river valleys, and required careful construction to ensure correct operation.\n\nA leat, called a \"main\", \"carrier\" or \"top carrier\", was used to divert water from the river and carry it down the valley at a gentler slope than the river, producing a hydrostatic head between the two. Mains were often along the edge of the valley, each main supplying up to about of the valley. The water from the main was used to supply many smaller carriers, on the crests of ridges built across the fields. The channel on the crest of each ridge would overflow slowly down the sides (the \"panes\") of the ridge, the channel eventually tapering to an end at the tip of the ridge. The seeping water would then be collected between the ridges, in \"drains\" or \"drawns\", these joining to form a \"bottom carrier\" or \"tail drain\" which returned the water to the river. The ridges and the drains made an interlocking grid (like interlaced fingers), but the ridge-top channels and the drains did not connect directly. A \"by-carrier\" took any water not needed for irrigation straight from the main back to the river. The ridges varied in height depending on the available head – usually from around . The pattern of carriers and drains was generally regular, but it was adapted to fit the natural topography of the ground and the locations of suitable places for the offtake and return of water.\n\nThe water flow was controlled by a system of \"hatches\" (sluice gates) and \"stops\" (small earth or wooden-board dams). Irrigation could be provided separately for each section of water-meadow. Sometimes aqueducts took carriers over drains, and causeways and culverts provided access for wagons. The \"working\" or \"floating\" (irrigation) and maintenance of the water-meadow was done by a highly skilled craftsman called a \"drowner\" or \"waterman\", who was often employed by several adjacent farmers.\n\nThe terminology used for watermeadows varied considerably with locality and dialect.\n\nWater-meadow irrigation did not aim to flood the ground, but to keep it continuously damp – a working water-meadow has no standing water. Irrigation in early spring kept frosts off the ground and so allowed grass to grow several weeks earlier than otherwise, and in dry summer weather irrigation kept the grass growing. It also allowed the ground to absorb any plant nutrients or silt carried by the river water – this fertilised the grassland, and incidentally also reduced eutrophication of the river water by nutrient pollution. The grass was used both for making hay and for grazing by livestock (usually cattle or sheep).\n\nFormer water-meadows are found along many river valleys, where the sluice gates, channels and field ridges may still be visible (however the ridges should not be confused with ridge and furrow topography, which is found on drier ground and has a very different origin in arable farming). The drains in a derelict water-meadow are generally clogged and wet, and most of the carrier channels are dry, with the smaller ones on the ridge-tops often invisible. If any main carrier channels still flow, they usually connect permanently to the by-carriers. The larger sluices may be concealed under the roots of trees (such as crack willows), which have grown up from seedlings established in the brickwork. The complex mixture of wet and drier ground often gives derelict water-meadows particularly high wetland biodiversity.\n\nDerelict water-meadows can be transformed into wildlife protection and conservation areas by repairing the irrigation, as is the case of Josefov Meadows in the Czech Republic. By imitating the natural river flooding which is rare in modern straightened and dammed rivers, a rich biodiversity can be restored and attract and sustain many rare and protected wetland species.\n\n\n"}

It was initially not well received; even some who had been strong supporters of Debussy's work were unenthusiastic. But the work was performed in the US in 1907 and Britain in 1908; after its second performance in Paris, in 1908, it quickly became one of Debussy's most admired and frequently performed orchestral works.\n\nThe first audio recording of the work was made in 1928. Since then, orchestras and conductors from around the world have set it down in many studio or live concert recordings.\n\n\"La mer\" was the second of Debussy's three orchestral works in three sections. The first, the \"Nocturnes\", was premiered in Paris in 1901, and though it had not made any great impact with the public it was well reviewed by musicians including Paul Dukas, Alfred Bruneau and Pierre de Bréville. Debussy conceived the idea of a more complex tripartite orchestral piece, and began work in August 1903. He was usually a slow worker, and although the composition of \"La mer\" took him more than a year and a half, this was unusually quick progress by his standards, particularly at a time of upheaval in his personal life. He began composing the work while visiting his parents-in-law in Burgundy; by the time it was complete, he had left his wife and was living with Emma Bardac, who was pregnant with Debussy's child. \n\nDebussy retained fond childhood memories of the beauties of the sea, but when composing \"La mer\" he rarely visited it, spending most of his time far away from large bodies of water. He drew inspiration from art, \"preferring the seascapes available in painting and literature...\" to the physical sea. Although the detailed scheme of the work changed during its composition, Debussy decided from the outset that it was to be \"three symphonic sketches\" with the title \"La mer\". In a letter to André Messager, he described the planned sections as \"Mère belle aux Îles Sanguinaires\", \"Jeu de vagues\", and \"Le vent fait danser la mer\". The first of these, inspired by a short story of the same name by Camille Mauclair, was abandoned in favour of a less restrictive theme, the sea from dawn to midday. The last was also dropped, as too reminiscent of ballet, and the less specific theme of the dialogue between the wind and the sea took its place.\n\nDebussy completed \"La mer\" in March 1905 at the Grand Hotel, Eastbourne on the English Channel coast, which he described to his publisher, Durand, as \"a charming peaceful spot: the sea unfurls itself with an utterly British correctness.\" He arranged the piece for piano four hands in 1905, and in 1909 Durand published a second edition of \"La mer\" with the composer's revisions.\n\n\"La mer\" is scored for 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 2 cornets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tam tam, glockenspiel, 2 harps and strings.\n\nA typical performance of the piece lasts about 23 or 24 minutes. It is in three movements:\nUsually translated as:\n\nDebussy called \"La mer\" \"three symphonic sketches,\" deliberately avoiding the term symphony. Simon Trezise, in his book \"Debussy: La Mer\", comments, \"He had not composed an orthodox symphony, but neither did he want \"La mer\" to be known as a symphonic poem ... [and by calling it] 'Three symphonic sketches' ... [Debussy] must have felt that he had deftly avoided association with either genre.\" Yet the work has sometimes been called a symphony, even on occasion, by Debussy himself. It consists of two powerful outer movements framing a lighter, faster piece which acts as a type of scherzo. But the analyst Jean Barraqué describes \"La mer\" as the first work to have an \"open\" form – a \"devenir\" \"sonore\" or \"sonorous becoming... a developmental process in which the very notions of exposition and development coexist in an uninterrupted burst.\" Simon Trezise, in his 1994 book \"Debussy: La Mer\" comments, \"motifs are constantly propagated by derivation from earlier motifs\"\n\nTrezise writes that \"for much of \"La Mer,\" Debussy spurns the more obvious devices associated with the sea, wind, and concomitant storm in favour of his own, highly individual vocabulary\". Caroline Potter, in \"The Cambridge Companion to Debussy\", comments that Debussy's depiction of the sea \"avoids monotony by using a multitude of water figurations that could be classified as musical onomatopoeia: they evoke the sensation of swaying movement of waves and suggest the pitter-patter of falling droplets of spray\" (and so forth), and – significantly – avoid the arpeggiated triads used by Schubert and Wagner to evoke the movement of water. In \"The Cambridge Companion to Debussy\", Mark DeVoto describes \"La mer\" as \"much more complex than anything Debussy had written earlier\", particularly the \"Nocturnes\": \n\nThe author, musicologist and pianist Roy Howat has observed, in his book \"Debussy in Proportion\", that the formal boundaries of \"La mer\" correspond exactly to the mathematical ratios called the Golden Section. Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence \"remarkable,\" but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.\n\nThe premiere was given on 15 October 1905 in Paris, by the Orchestre Lamoureux under the direction of Camille Chevillard. The piece was initially not well received. Pierre Lalo, critic of \"Le Temps\", hitherto an admirer of Debussy's work, wrote, \"I do not hear, I do not see, I do not smell the sea\". Another Parisian critic, Louis Schneider, wrote, \"The audience seemed rather disappointed: they expected the ocean, something big, something colossal, but they were served instead with some agitated water in a saucer.\" When the conductor Karl Muck gave the first American performances of \"La mer\" in March 1907, the critic Henry Krehbiel wrote:\n\nThe work was not performed in Britain until 1908, when the composer – though a reluctant conductor – gave a performance at the Queen's Hall; the work was enthusiastically reviewed in \"The Times\", but \"The Observer\" thought it lacked \"real force of elemental strength\". \"The Manchester Guardian\" thought the work an advance on Debussy's earlier work in some respects, although \"the vagueness of thematic outline is carried to hitherto unheard-of lengths\", and found \"moments of great beauty\" in the work; and \"The Musical Times\" reserved judgment, but noted that the audience had been highly enthusiastic. Debussy commented that his music was more popular in London than in Paris.\n\nOne reason for the negative reception at the Paris premiere may have been public disapproval of Debussy's treatment of his wife, but another was the mediocre performance by the conductor and orchestra. Chevillard was a respected interpreter of the classics, but was not at home with new music. It was not until 1908, at the second performance of the work in Paris, conducted by the composer, that \"La mer\" became a success with the public. Trezise records that at the time, many felt the 1908 concert presented the real first performance of the piece.\n\nAlthough some of Debussy's contemporaries drew analogies between \"La mer\" and French Impressionist paintings – much to the composer's irritation – others have detected the influence of his admiration for the English painter J. M. W. Turner; and Debussy's choice of Hokusai's \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\" for the cover of the printed score indicates the influence of Japanese art on him. Despite Debussy's scorn for the term \"impressionism\" applied to his or anyone else's music – a matter on which he and Ravel were of the same firm opinion – the term was used by some of his most devoted admirers. His biographer Edward Lockspeiser called \"La mer\" \"the greatest example of an orchestral Impressionist work\", and more recently in \"The Cambridge Companion to Debussy\" Nigel Simeone commented, \"It does not seem unduly far-fetched to see a parallel in Monet's seascapes\".\nIn the decades after the premiere \"La mer\" established itself in the core orchestral repertoire. In 2018 the online archive of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra reported that the orchestra had played the work at 135 concert performances since 1917, under conductors including Willem Mengelberg, Arturo Toscanini, John Barbirolli, Pierre Monteux, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez and Valery Gergiev. In 1979 \"The Musical Times\" rated \"La mer\" the composer's most important orchestral work. The pianist Sviatoslav Richter called \"La mer\" \"A piece that I rank alongside the \"St Matthew Passion\" and the \"Ring\" cycle as one of my favourite works\".\n\nThe first recording of \"La mer\" was made by the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, conducted by Piero Coppola in 1928. It has been reissued on LP and CD. Recordings conducted by other musicians who had known and worked with Debussy include those by Monteux and Ernest Ansermet, who both conducted the work on more than one recording. Well known recordings from the monaural era include those by the NBC Symphony Orchestra and Toscanini, and the Philharmonia on recordings conducted by Herbert von Karajan and Guido Cantelli. Of recordings from the stereophonic LP era, \"The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music\" singled out those by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner, and the Berlin Philharmonic under Karajan. \n\nOf the many recordings available, a comparative survey for Classic FM (2018) recommended a short list of five, those by the Orchestre National de France and Jean Martinon; the Cleveland Orchestra and Boulez; the Berlin Philharmonic and Simon Rattle; the Seoul Philharmonic and Myung-Whun Chung, and – its top recommendation – the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Bernard Haitink.\n\n\"La mer\" has influenced a number of composers throughout the 20th century. Luciano Berio quoted \"La mer\" in the 3rd movement of his 1968 \"Sinfonia\"; John Williams used simplified versions of motifs from \"La mer\" in the score he wrote for \"Jaws\" (1975); and in 2002 the Norwegian composer Biosphere loosely based his ambient album \"Shenzhou\" around looped samples of \"La mer\".\n\n\"La mer\" served as an influence for the Nine Inch Nails song of the same name from their 1999 album \"The Fragile\". Trent Reznor wrote this song during his time at an ocean side home where he said he was trying to write music, but in reality he was also suicidal, and \"La Mer\" was the only song he managed to write during this time.\n\n"}

He was the last British person to be governor of either state.\n\nAfter studies at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Bastyan was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the British Army's Sherwood Foresters on 30 August 1923, and promoted to lieutenant on 30 August 1925. He was promoted to captain in the West Yorkshire Regiment on 4 April 1935 and attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1936–1937, transferring to the Royal Irish Fusiliers in 1937, and seeing service in Palestine from 1938–1939. Bastyan was promoted to major on 30 August 1940.\n\nFrom November 1939 to June 1941, during the Second World War, Bastyan served as a GSO II in Palestine with the Royal Irish Fusiliers and was mentioned in despatches in March 1941. He served as assistant quarter-master general in the Middle East from July 1941 to May 1942, subsequently as deputy director of the Higher Commander's Course from May to October of that year. Bastyan was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in September 1942, by which time he was a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to temporary brigadier the following month and confirmed as a war substantive lieutenant colonel in November 1942. Bastyan served as a temporary brigadier (quartermaster) from then until January 1944, when he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in August 1944.\n\nIn December 1944, Bastyan was appointed an acting major general (Administration, Allied Land Forces, South East Asia). He was promoted to colonel in July 1945, and confirmed as temporary major general in October 1946. After the war, Bastyan served as General Officer Commanding the British Army of the Rhine until 1948, after which he worked at the War Office through 1952. He was promoted to substantive major-general on 26 January 1948, with seniority from 13 April 1946.\n\nDuring his military career, senior posts held by him included head of logistics during the Berlin airlift (1946–48) and Commander of British Forces in Hong Kong from 1957 to 1960. He retired from the British Army in 1960 and was appointed Governor of South Australia on 4 April 1961.\n\nOn two occasions during his period as governor in South Australia, the elections did not result in a clear majority. In both 1962 and 1968, rather than make a precipitate decision to select the premier from the party with the largest minority (and more than 50% of the votes), he bided time and waited for parliament to meet. In both cases, the quick decision would have turned out to be wrong, and the South Australian House of Assembly selected the premier from the other party. In 1962, this allowed the Liberal and Country League Playford government to continue rather than the Labor Party led by Frank Walsh. In 1968, the Labor government of Don Dunstan lost to the Liberal and Country League led by Steele Hall. Without this leadership from the governor, there would likely have been a need for another election much sooner.\n\nBastyan's term in office in Tasmania was relatively uneventful, though he did have to deal, after the 1969 State election, with a deadlocked House of Assembly where both the ALP and Liberals had the same number of seats. The matter was resolved by Kevin Lyons, the lone representative of the tiny Centre Party entering into a coalition with the Liberals. Bastyan returned to Adelaide in his retirement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143655", "title": "Port Meadow, Oxford", "text": "Port Meadow, Oxford\n\nPort Meadow is a large meadow of open common land beside the River Thames to the north and west of Oxford, England.\n\nThe meadow is an ancient area of grazing land, still used for horses and cattle, and according to legend has never been ploughed, at least for around 4,000 years. It is said that in return for helping to defend the kingdom against the marauding Danes, the Freemen of Oxford were given the of pasture next to the River Thames by Alfred the Great who, legend has it, founded the city in the 10th century (although Alfred actually died in the 9th century). The Freemen's collective right to graze their animals free of charge is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 and has been exercised ever since.\n\nThe meadow runs from Jericho to Wolvercote (where north of the Shiplake Ditch it becomes Wolvercote Common) along the east (left) bank of the River Thames, with the Cotswold Line railway, the Oxford Canal and the suburb of North Oxford further to the east, and the village of Binsey to the west. Access to Port Meadow is via Walton Well Road or Aristotle Lane in the south (or from the south via Roger Dudman Way or the Thames Path) or from Godstow Road, Wolvercote via Wolvercote Common in the north. It is a typical English flood-meadow and is a favourite area for walking, with easy access from the city of Oxford. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest. At the southern end of the meadow is Fiddler's Island in the River Thames. In the winter the meadow sometimes floods; if frozen it forms a huge and relatively safe area for skating. In late spring vast areas are carpeted with buttercups. Horses, cattle and geese graze the meadow and many birds can often be seen.\n\nAt the eastern edge of Port Meadow, just north of the entrance from Aristotle Lane, is Burgess Field, a reclaimed landfill site and home to a nature reserve, managed by Oxford City Council. It covers an area of about and a circular path around the edge of the reserve takes you through some small copses.\n\nThe River Thames (known as the Isis in this area) flows past this large grazing meadow. This is where the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up the river on 4 July 1862 with three young girls — Lorina, Alice, and Edith Liddell. While journeying slowly from Folly Bridge to near Godstow, Dodgson began at their request to make up a story that later was expanded into \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\n\nBecause the meadow appears never to have been ploughed, it contains well-preserved archaeological remains, some of which survive as residual earthworks. Of particular note are several Bronze Age round barrows, an area of Iron Age settlement, and the foundations of 17th-century fortifications from the Parliamentary siege of Oxford during the English Civil War.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the meadow was used for horse racing, and low stone bridges laid over washes and ditches for this purpose still survive.\n\nDuring the First World War part of Port Meadow was used to train the Royal Flying Corps and turned into a military aerodrome. Fifteen air crew and pilots were killed flying from Port Meadow or close by. In 1940, during the Second World War, a camp was set up on the meadow for military personnel evacuated from Dunkirk.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the meadow was known as a location for free festivals and raves.\n\nJust across the Thames is Bossoms Boatyard, with a small marina and Medley Footbridge across the Thames. The Medley Sailing Club, the furthest upstream sailing club on the River Thames, is on the western bank. To the south is the start of the Castle Mill Stream and Cripley Meadow, largely consisting of allotments.\n\nFrom 2012, the Oxford University Estates Directorate, with the help of Longcross, have been developing the one-hectare Castle Mill site (400 m × 25 m) between the Cripley Meadow Allotments and the railway tracks, close to the southern end of Port Meadow, as extensive student accommodation.\nThe development was controversial, since the four to five storey blocks overlook Port Meadow. Campaigners warned of damage to views of Oxford. There has been an online petition and a \"Save Port Meadow\" campaign was established in December 2012. Concerns were raised by the Oxford Preservation Trust and the Green Party. Anger was caused even among members of Oxford University. The development was likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\". In February 2013, Oxford City Council entered negotiations with Oxford University to reduce the height of the buildings by two storeys. On 7 May 2013, the Campaign to Protect Rural England applied to the High Court for judicial review of the decision to grant planning permission on the grounds that requirements for a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were not met.\n\nIn 2016, Oxford University proposed an array of mitigating techniques, including cladding and horizontal beams to \"break up the vertical façade\". Later, changes were made to the buildings in an attempt to reduce their visual impact.\n\n"}

He is best known as the drummer in London band Hefner, and has also played independently as ANT and now performs solo as Antony Harding.\n\nIt all started back in 1997 at the intimate 12 Bar Club in London supporting London's best unsigned band Rhatigan on a monthly residency. Antony's first CD, \"Cures For Broken Hearts\" came out in 2000 on Fortune & Glory Records (UK) to positive reviews: \"Likeable delicate stuff\" said Q Magazine, \"An unexpected Joy\" said Mojo, and the CD received airplay on BBC Radio One. He was asked to record a solo session for John Peel during the summer of that year, featuring 4 acoustic versions of songs that would later appear on his debut album. The debut album, a collection of London home recordings called \"A Long Way To Blow A Kiss\", was quietly released in 2002 on Fortune and Glory Records. It was also warmly received: \"Ant proves a delicate little joy\" said Teletext, and \"Scruffy, gorgeous notes-to-self\" was how Mojo described it. After relocating to Malmo, Sweden, \"Floating On The Breeze\", a mini album of home recordings was released on Italian label Homesleep Records (2003): \"Charmed mini album of ringing acoustic pop\" said Uncut, \"Pleasing bedroom rock\" said the NME. Ant's first compilation CD of rarities and b-sides, \"Sad To See It's Morning\", emerged on Fortune & Glory in 2004 to positive words: \"Beautiful acoustic nuggets\" Mojo, \"Sweet, charming, piquant pop gems\" Record Collector. The second album, \"Footprints Through the Snow\", was recorded in 8 days one hot summer in Bologna Italy in 2004 and released in 2006 to rave Italian reviews: \"Close your eyes and breathe it in\" recommended Subba-Cultcha. After a break of some years, another mini album of home recordings, this time aided by friends, entitled \"These Long Dark Country Roads\", came out in 2009 on cult Spanish label Acuarela Discos: \"Gorgeous lo-fi, acoustic pop songs\" said \"Rock Feedback\". That 'difficult' third album \"The Birds Sing Goodnight To You And Me\", recorded with his old Hefner bandmates Darren Hayman, John Morrison and Jack Hayter, seemed to come easily. It was released in March 2012 on Italian label We Were Never Being Boring, and was hailed as \"the album of the year 2012\" by Dandelion Radio's Mark Whitby. It was followed in 2013 by a mini-mini-album of sunny instrumentals entitled \"Only Pipe Dreams in the Pipeline\", once again on the WWNBB collective of Italy, described as \"A feast of frothy folk\" by Soundsxp.His fourth full-length album, \"By The Yellow Sea\", and his first as Antony Harding, set sail in June 2015. Antony has toured in England, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and China, where he celebrated his 100th solo performance. The long awaited 'best of' ANT is due out at the end of 2019.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143658", "title": "Cerrado", "text": "Cerrado\n\nThe Cerrado (, ) is a vast tropical savanna ecoregion of Brazil, particularly in the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Minas Gerais and the Federal District. The Cerrado biome core areas are the plateaus in the center of Brazil. The main habitat types of the Cerrado include: forest savanna, wooded savanna, park savanna and gramineous-woody savanna. Savanna wetlands and gallery forests are also included. The second largest of Brazil's major habitat types, after the Amazonian rainforest, the Cerrado accounts for a full 21 percent of the country's land area (extending marginally into Paraguay and Bolivia).\n\nThe first detailed account of the Brazilian cerrados was provided by Danish botanist Eugenius Warming (1892) in the book \"Lagoa Santa\", in which he describes the main features of the cerrado vegetation in the state of Minas Gerais.\n\nSince then vast amounts of research have proved that the Cerrado is one of the richest of all tropical savanna regions and has high levels of endemism. Characterized by enormous ranges of plant and animal biodiversity, World Wide Fund for Nature named it the biologically richest savanna in the world, with about 10,000 plant species and 10 endemic bird species. There are nearly 200 species of mammal in the Cerrado, though only 14 are endemic.\n\nThe Cerrado's climate is typical of the wetter savanna regions of the world, with a semi-humid tropical climate. The Cerrado is limited to two dominant seasons throughout the year, wet and dry. Annual temperatures for the Cerrado average between 22 and 27 °C and average precipitation between 800–2000 mm for over 90% of the area. This ecoregion has a very strong dry season during the southern winter (approx. April–September).\n\nThe Cerrado is characterized by unique vegetation types. It is composed of a shifting mosaic of habitats, with the savanna-like \"cerrado\" itself on well-drained areas between strips of gallery forest (closed canopy tall forest) which occur along streams. Between the \"cerrado\" and the gallery forest is an area of vegetation known as the wet \"campo\" with distinct up- and downslope borders where tree growth is inhibited due to wide seasonal fluctuations in the water table.\n\nThe savanna portion of the Cerrado is heterogeneous in terms of canopy cover. Goodland (1971) divided the Cerrado into four categories ranging from least to most canopy cover: \"campo sujo\" (herbaceous layer with occasional small trees about 3 m tall), \"campo cerrado\" (slightly higher density of trees about 4 m tall on average), \"cerrado sensu stricto\" (orchard-like vegetation with trees about 6 m high) and \"cerradao\" (canopy cover near 50% with general height 9 m).\n\nProbably around 800 species of trees are found in the Cerrado. Among the most diverse families of trees in the Cerrado are the Leguminosae (153), Malpighiaceae (46), Myrtaceae (43), Melastomataceae (32) and Rubiaceae (30). Much of the Cerrado is dominated by the Vochysiaceae (23 species in the Cerrado) due to the abundance of three species in the genus \"Qualea\". The herbaceous layer usually reaches about 60 cm in height and is composed mainly of the Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Leguminosae, Compositae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Much of the vegetation in the gallery forests is similar to nearby rainforest; however, there are some endemic species found only in the Cerrado gallery forests.\n\nSoil fertility, fire regime and hydrology are thought to be most influential in determining Cerrado vegetation. Cerrado soils are always well-drained and most are oxisols with low pH and low calcium and magnesium. The amount of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus has been found to be positively correlated with tree trunk basal area in Cerrado habitats. Much as in other grasslands and savannas, fire is important in maintaining and shaping the Cerrado's landscape; many plants in the Cerrado are fire-adapted, exhibiting characters like thick corky bark to withstand the heat.\n\nCerrado vegetation is believed to be ancient, stretching back perhaps as far in a prototypic form during the Cretaceous before Africa and South America separated. A dynamic expansion and contraction between cerrado and Amazonian rainforest has probably occurred historically, with expansion of the Cerrado during glacial periods like the Pleistocene. These processes and the resulting fragmentation have probably contributed to the high species richness both of the Cerrado and of the Amazonian rainforest.\n\nThe insects of the Cerrado are relatively understudied. A yearlong survey of the Cerrado at one reserve in Brazil found that the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Isoptera accounted for 89.5% of all captures. The Cerrado also supports high density of leaf cutter ant (\"saúvas\") nests (up to 4000 per hectare) which are also very diverse. Along with termites, leaf cutter ants are the primary herbivores of the Cerrado and play an important role in consuming and decomposing organic matter, as well as constituting an important food source to many other animal species. The highest diversity of galling insects (insects that build galls) in the world is also found in the Cerrado, with the most species (46) found at the base of the Serro do Cipó in southeast Brazil.\n\nThe Cerrado has a high diversity of vertebrates; 150 amphibian species, 120 reptile species, 837 bird species, and 161 mammal species have been recorded. Lizard diversity is generally thought to be relatively low in the Cerrado compared to other areas like \"caatinga\" or lowland rainforest although one recent study found 57 species in one cerrado area with the high diversity driven by the availability of open habitat. \"Ameiva ameiva\" is among the largest lizards found in the Cerrado and is the most important lizard predator where it is found in the Cerrado. There is a relatively high diversity of snakes in the Cerrado (22–61 species, depending on site) with Colubridae being the richest family. The open nature of the \"cerrado\" vegetation most likely contributes to the high diversity of snakes. Information about Cerrado amphibians is extremely limited, although the Cerrado probably has a unique assemblage of species with some endemic to the region.\nMost birds found in the Cerrado breed there although there are some Austral migrants (breed in temperate South America and winter in the Amazon basin) and Nearctic migrants (breed in temperate North America and winter in the Neotropics) that pass through. Most breeding birds in the Cerrado are found in more closed canopy areas like gallery forests although 27% of the birds breed only in open habitats and 21% breed in either open or closed habitats. Many of the birds in the Cerrado, especially those found in closed forest, are related to species from the Atlantic rainforest and also the Amazon rainforest. The crowned solitary eagle, hyacinth macaw, toco toucan, buff-necked ibis, dwarf tinamou, and Brazilian merganser are examples of birds found in the Cerrado.\n\nGallery forests serve as primary habitat for most of the mammals in the Cerrado, having more water, being protected from fires that sweep the landscape and having a more highly structured habitat. Eleven mammal species are endemic to the Cerrado. Notable species include large herbivores like the Brazilian tapir and Pampas deer and large predators like the maned wolf, cougar, jaguar, giant otter, ocelot and jaguarundi. Although the diversity is much lower than in the adjacent Amazon and Atlantic Forest, several species of monkeys are present, including black-striped capuchin, black howler monkey and black-tufted marmoset.\n\nTaking advantage of the sprouting of the herbaceous stratum that follows a burning in the Cerrado, the aboriginal inhabitants of these regions learned to use the fire as a tool, to increase the fodder to offer to their domesticated animals.\n\nXavantes, Tapuias, Karajás, Avá-Canoeiros, Krahôs, Xerentes, Xacriabás were some of the first indigenous peoples occupying different regions in the Cerrado. Many groups among the indigenous were nomads and explored the Cerrado by hunting and collecting. Others practiced coivara agriculture, an itinerant type of slash-and-burn agriculture. The mixing of indigenous, quilombola maroon communities, extractivists, geraizeiros (living in the drier regions), riverbank dwellers and vazanteiros (who live on floodplains) shaped a diverse local population that relies heavily on the resources of their environment.\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, agricultural activities in the Cerrado were very limited, directed mainly at the extensive production of beef cattle for subsistence of the local market, since cerrado soils are naturally infertile for agricultural production. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to Brasília has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region. From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental programs have been launched with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region, through subsidies for agriculture. As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production.\n\nOn the other hand, the urban pressure and the rapid establishment of agricultural activities in the region have been rapidly reducing the biodiversity of the ecosystems, and the population in the Cerrado region more than doubled from 1970 to 2010, going from 35.8 million to 76 million.\n\nThe Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, Embrapa, discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tons of lime per hectare. This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area. Researchers also developed tropical varieties of soybeans, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main soyabeans exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.\n\nToday the Cerrado region provides more than 70% of the beef cattle production in the country, being also a major production center of grains, mainly soya, beans, maize and rice. Large extensions of the Cerrado are also used for the production of cellulose pulp for the paper industry, with the cultivation of several species of \"Eucalyptus\" and \"Pinus\", but as a secondary activity. Coffee produced in the Cerrado is now a major export.\n\nCharcoal production for Brazil's steel industry comes in second to agriculture in the Cerrado. They actually are quite intertwined. When land is being cleared to make more land for agriculture, the tree's trunks and roots are often used in the production of charcoal, helping to make money for the clearing. The Brazilian steel industry has traditionally always used the trunks and roots from the Cerrado for charcoal but now that the steel mills in the state of Minas Gerais are the world's largest, it has taken a much higher toll on the Cerrado. However, recently because of the conservation efforts and the diminishing vegetation in the Cerrado, they now are receiving some charcoal from the eucalyptus plantations and these efforts are growing.\n\nThe Cerrado biome is strategic for the water resources of Brazil. The biome contains the headwaters and the largest portion of South American watersheds (the Paraná-Paraguay, Araguaia-Tocantins, and São Francisco river basins) and the upper catchments of large Amazon tributaries, such as the Xingu and Tapajós. During the last four decades, the Cerrado’s rivers basins have been highly impacted by extreme deforestation, expansion of the agricultural and cattle ranching frontier, construction of dams, and extraction of water for irrigation\n\nThe Cerrado is the second largest biome in South America and the most biodiverse savanna in the world. However, it is not currently recognized by the Brazilian Constitution as a National Heritage. It is also home to the Guarani Aquifer, stores the largest fresh water underground reservoirs in South America, and supplies water to a third of the Amazon river and the largest basins in the continent.\n\nBrazilian agriculturalists and ministers regard it as it has no conservation value, and the government has protected merely 1.5% of the Cerrado biome in Federal Reserves. By 1994, an estimated 695,000 km of cerrado (representing 35% of its area) had been converted to 'anthropic landscape'. In total, 37.3% of the Cerrado has already been totally converted to human use, while an additional 41.4% is used for pasture and charcoal production. The gallery forests in the region have been among the most heavily affected. It is estimated that only about 432,814 km2, or 21.3% of the original vegetation, remains intact today.\n\nDuring the last 25 years this biome has been increasingly threatened by industrial single-crop monoculture farming, particularly soybeans, the unregulated expansion of industrial agriculture, the burning of vegetation for charcoal and the development of dams to provide irrigation are drawing criticisms and have been identified as potential threats to several Brazilian rivers.\n\nThis industrial farming of the Cerrado, with the clearing of land for Eucalyptus and Soya plantation, has grown so much because of various forms of subsidy, including very generous tax incentives and low interest loans, this has caused an enormous establishment of highly mechanized, capital intensive system of agriculture. There is also a strong agribusiness lobby in Brazil and in particular, the production of soybeans in the Cerrado is influenced by large corporations such as ADM, Cargill and Bunge, these latter two directly associated with the mass deforestation of this biome.\n\nOne issue with expanding this reserve is that research needs to be done to choose the location of these reserves because the Cerrado biome is floristically very heterogeneous and constitutes a biological mosaic. Teams from the University of Brasília, CPAC and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh have been collaborating on this project for a number of years funded by Brazilian, European Community and British funds. The project has recently been expanded into a major Anglo-Brazilian initiative, Conservation and Management of the Biodiversity of the Cerrado Biome, with UK Overseas Development Administration funding1. Its aim is to survey the floristic patterns of Cerrado vegetation and to discover representative areas and biodiversity `hot-spots'.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was working as a security contractor for Blackwater Security when he was killed in the 31 March 2004 Fallujah ambush within days of arriving in Iraq.\n\nHelvenston was a personal trainer for Hollywood celebrities such as Demi Moore (for \"G.I. Jane\"), and was also featured in the reality shows \"Combat Missions\" and \"Man vs. Beast\" (in the latter, he completed an obstacle course faster than a chimpanzee). He also starred in a reality series called \"Extreme Expeditions: Model Behavior\" months before he left for Iraq. The series was shot in Mexico and is finished, but has not yet aired.\n\nHelvenston's great-great-uncle was Secretary of War Elihu Root.\n\nHe joined the Navy at 17 and became the youngest person to complete Navy SEAL training. He spent 12 years in the Navy SEALs until he left in 1994 as an E-6 (Quartermaster First Class).\n\nHelvenston began training at Blackwater USA's facilities in March 2004, and developed a personal conflict with head trainer Justin \"Shrek\" McQuown. Helvenston arrived in Kuwait on March 18, where he was under the management of John and Kathy Potter, whom he knew from \"Combat Missions\".\n\nEmployee John Potter had helped Blackwater Security (since renamed \"Academi\") win the contract to provide security for kitchen equipment convoys for the Kuwait company Regency Hotel and Hospital Company and Eurest Support Services (ESS was a subcontractor of Halliburton KBR). The contract billed Regency $815 a day; Helvenston and the other contractors were paid $600 a day.\n\nThe original contract called for at least three men per vehicle on security missions \"with a minimum of two armored vehicles to support ESS movements\". In addition, the contract called for a heavily armed rear gunner, and time before any mission to review the route and conduct a risk assessment and pre-trip inspection.\n\nBlackwater signed a revised contract with Regency on March 12, 2004 that removed the word \"armored\". Potter insisted that his men be given armored vehicles, however, and was removed as project manager on March 24, replaced by Justin McQuown.\n\nOn March 27, two days before Helvenston's scheduled deployment to Iraq, McQuown reassigned him to a team leaving on the 28th, over the objections of numerous other Blackwater employees. Helvenston believed McQuown resented him and deliberately reassigned Helvenston at the last minute. In one of Helvenston's final emails before his death, he wrote to the owner of Blackwater, claiming McQuown's behavior was \"very manipulative, duplicitive [sic], immature and unprofessional,\" with the hidden agenda \"Lets [sic] see if we can screw with Scott.\"\n\nOn March 30, McQuown sent Helvenston out with three other contractors, Jerry Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, to guard a convoy for ESS traveling from Baghdad to a military base west of Fallujah. They were in two unarmored vehicles and had no map.\n\nAlong with squad members Jerry \"Jerko\" Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, Helvenston was transporting food and other equipment in unarmored vehicles to the center of the city of Fallujah when the team was ambushed by insurgents. The four contractors were killed with grenades and small arms fire. Their bodies were dragged from their vehicles, beaten and set ablaze. Their burned and mutilated corpses were then dragged through the streets, and two of them hung from a bridge crossing the Euphrates.\n\nPhotos of the event were released to news agencies worldwide.\n\nThe families of the four dead contractors, led by Helvenston's mother Katy Helvenston-Wettengel and Jerry Zovko's mother Donna Zovko, filed suit against Blackwater with lawyer Daniel Callahan on January 5, 2005 (\"Helvenston et al. v. Blackwater Security\"), alleging wrongful death. Blackwater responded by counter-suing for $10 million.\n\nIn January 2011, both cases were thrown out of court by a federal judge. Counsel for the plaintiffs announced they would appeal the ruling.\n\n"}

Samson, after he left the punk band Propagandhi to start a publishing company. Samson joined bassist John P. Sutton and drummer Jason Tait of Red Fisher, another band from Winnipeg's punk scene, and created The Weakerthans as a vehicle for a more melodic and introspective brand of songwriting than their previous projects.\n\nThe origin of the band's name was explained, in 2004 by Samson, as having come from \"a few places.\" The first was a line from the 1992 film \"The Lover\": \"Go ahead, I'm weaker than you can possibly imagine.\" A second (he gave only two) was a line from Ralph Chaplin's union anthem \"Solidarity Forever\": \"What force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one?\" The band includes this line in the song \"Pamphleteer\" from the album \"Left and Leaving\".\n\nThe band's debut album, \"Fallow\", was released in 1997 on G7 Welcoming Committee Records, and garnered positive reviews from Canadian music critics. Guitarist Stephen Carroll, formerly of Painted Thin, subsequently joined the band, and \"Left and Leaving\" was released in 2000.\n\nSutton, who played on the band's first three albums, left in August 2004 and was replaced by Greg Smith.\n\nIn 2005, \"Left and Leaving\" was named one of the ten best Canadian albums of all time in \"Chart\" magazine's reader poll. In the same poll, Samson wrote the capsule review for another top ten finisher, The Lowest of the Low's \"Shakespeare My Butt\", which he cited as a major influence on his own music.\n\n\"Reunion Tour\" was released on September 25, 2007 in North America by Epitaph and ANTI-. The band released a video for \"Civil Twilight\", which consisted of a single, unbroken camera shot of the band on a Winnipeg Transit city bus.\n\nEpitaph also re-released the Weakerthans' first two albums, \"Fallow\" and \"Left and Leaving\", in Canada on November 6, 2007.\n\nIn February 2009, the band participated in Barenaked Ladies' annual Ships and Dip cruise. In a subsequent interview with Canwest News Service, Samson clarified that the band would be taking some downtime over the summer of 2009 before deciding when to start working on their next album. Shortly afterward, Samson announced a series of solo 7\" releases about Manitoba roads, which he planned to release over the next 18 months. The first, \"City Route 85\", was released on October 30, 2009 through Epitaph and ANTI-. After a second EP, \"Provincial Road 222\", in 2010, the project instead evolved into Samson's first official solo album, \"Provincial\".\n\nIn January 2010, the band announced that they would release a live album, \"Live at the Burton Cummings Theatre\", on March 23. At the same time, they also announced that they were recording material with Jim Bryson for his album \"The Falcon Lake Incident\", which was released on October 19, 2010.\n\nIn July 2015, media began to report that Tait had announced the band's breakup on Twitter. The band's social media accounts have been updated in accordance to the claims, defining themselves as \"cryogenically frozen\". Both Tait and Smith collaborated on Samson's 2016 solo album \"Winter Wheat\", which Samson described as feeling in some respects like a new Weakerthans album.\n\n\"Reunion Tour\" debuted at No. 22 on the Nielsen SoundScan chart for Canada in its first week of release, and at No. 4 on the alternative/modern rock chart. The album reached No. 181 on the United States \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nThe Weakerthans became the first band in the history of CBC Radio 3's \"R3-30\" charts to reach No. 1 with two different songs. The band's cover of Rheostatics' \"Bad Time to Be Poor\" reached No. 1 the week of June 21, 2007, and \"Civil Twilight\", the lead single from \"Reunion Tour\", hit the top spot the week of November 15, 2007. As of 2009, \"Civil Twilight\" remains tied with Arcade Fire's \"Black Mirror\" as the longest-running No. 1 in that chart's history. \"Civil Twilight\" was also the No. 1 song in \"The R3-30\"'s year-end Top 100 chart for 2007.\n\n\n\n\nMacKinnon and Poirier also have their own band, FemBots, and were previously associated with the bands Dig Circus and Hummer. Both Bryson and Fellows are solo artists in addition to touring with The Weakerthans; Fellows and Samson are married.

Although trained in brawling, technical, and high-flying wrestling techniques, he spent most of his career as a manager and referee.\n\nHildebrand started out as a manager in 1984 in the independent territories in the northeastern United States. He was a heel manager, and he managed Cactus Jack at one time as an evil Jewish character named Hymie P. Weiss. In 1986, he began training at Dominic DeNucci's wrestling school in Freedom, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe went on to Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) in 1992, where he was a referee under the ring name Mark Curtis and also wrestled occasionally as Kowabunga, fully costumed like a Ninja Turtle. Throughout his tenure in SMW as a referee, Hildebrand was known for wearing suspenders with his outfit. He also had brief heel work where he was allied with Jim Cornette, and made appearances in USWA along with Cornette. When SMW closed in 1995, he went on to work as a referee in Extreme Championship Wrestling, under his real name. After leaving ECW he went on to work as referee Mark Curtis in World Championship Wrestling. During his time in WCW, he earned the nickname The Shooter after a fan attempted to interfere in a match between Psychosis and Dean Malenko on the September 8, 1997 edition of \"Nitro\". As the invading fan slid under the bottom rope to enter the ring, Hildebrand, who happened to have glanced over just as the man jumped the guard rail, kneed the fan in the face and placed the man in a guillotine choke, and held him there until WCW security could take him into custody. Play-by-play announcer Tony Schiavone and color commentator Bobby Heenan found this amusing, with Heenan observing \"The smallest referee in the world just took him down!\"\n\nHildebrand's likeness is used for the cartoon referee in \"WCW/nWo Revenge\".\n\nHildebrand was diagnosed with stomach and bowel cancer in October 1997. After having surgery in attempt to remove it, he continued refereeing for WCW throughout the following months. During the final stage of his disease in 1999, a \"Curtis Goes Home\" benefit was held in his hometown of Rostraver Township, Pennsylvania. Cody Michaels developed and promoted the event, which is viewed by wrestling insiders and experts as one of the truly memorable events in history that actually brought together the major companies at the time, World Wrestling Federation, World Championship Wrestling, and Extreme Championship Wrestling, in support for one of the most genuinely loved workers in the industry. The major stars that worked and provided support that night included Mick Foley, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Shane Douglas, Bruno Sammartino, Dominic DeNucci, Terry Taylor, D'Lo Brown, Al Snow, Hugh Morrus, Les Thatcher, Billy Kidman, Chris Candido, and many others.\n\nHildebrand died from the disease on September 8, 1999 at the age of 37. He refereed one last match at a local independent show mere days before his death. Hildebrand's death was briefly acknowledged on the following edition of \"WCW Thunder\", but the first WCW event to have taken place after his death was a house show on September 11 at the Baltimore Arena, which was held in his honor with a ten bell salute. Late in the show, friends Shane Douglas, Chris Benoit, and Dean Malenko (known as Revolution) shared heartfelt words about Hildebrand and dedicated the show to him.\n\nSouthern States Wrestling held the \"Mark Curtis Memorial Weekend of Champions\", an annual fundraiser for the Children's Miracle Network, from 2000 to 2003. Hildebrand also inspired the \"Mark Curtis Fantasy Camp 2001\" a training event with Hugh Morrus on hand. A \"Mark Curtis Memorial Show\" would also be held on May 7, 2005 at Freedom Hall in Johnson City, Tennessee. The main event pitted Al Snow and D'Lo Brown against Shane Douglas and Mick Foley.\n\nIt was announced on Sunday, February 25, 2018 that Michaels, Brian Hildebrand and Angie Minelli made up the Class of 2018 Keystone State Wrestling Alliance (KSWA) Hall of Fame. The ceremony took place on Saturday, March 24, 2018 in Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n"}

Sainis claim to be descendants of a king, Shurasena, as well as of Krishna and Porus, and to be related to the ancient Shoorsaini clan, noted in Puranic literature. The Saini community is given representation in government jobs and educational institutes under Other Backward Class (OBC) category in states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The 1901 census noted that people using the Shoorsaini name were by then found only in Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. Mali Rajputs also claim themselves to be Sainis.\n\nAs both a statutory agricultural tribe and a designated martial race during the British Raj era that followed the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Sainis had been chiefly engaged in both agriculture and military service since then until recent times. However, since the independence of India, Sainis have diversified into different trades and professions other than military and agriculture. Sainis are now also seen in increasing numbers as businessmen, lawyers, professors, civil servants, engineers, doctors and research scientists, etc.\n\nSainis profess in both Hinduism and Sikhism. They have a national organisation called \"Saini Rajput Mahasabha\" located in Delhi, established in 1920.\n\nThe Sainis of Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur districts claim to be the descendants of the Rajputs of the Yaduvanshi or Surasena lineage who ruled these kingdoms, who came to these areas to avoid forced conversion to Islam.\n\nGahlot and Banshidhar (1989) indicate some commonality in origin with Rajput Malis of Rajputana, who are also stated to be of Rajput descent. However, scholars add that of the two, the Sainis continue to maintain their Rajput character despite adoption of agriculture in the era of Muslim ascendancy. The former were also included as part of Rajputs in the Marwar State Census of 1891.\n\nDuring the British period Sainis were classified as both a statutory agricultural tribe and, later, a martial race. The latter was an administrative device based on the now-discredited theories of scientific racism: ethnic communities were categorised as being either martial or non-martial, with the latter being those who were thought to be unfit to serve in armies due to their sedentary lifestyles. The community was also one of several peasant peoples who benefitted from the development of the Punjab Canal Colonies, through which they obtained land grants from the British authorities, especially in the Chenab Colony following the introduction of the Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1900.\n\nSome Saini landlords were also appointed as \"zaildars\", or revenue-collectors, in various districts.\n\nTraditionally, Sainis have been married through Vedic ceremonies performed by Brahmins of Sanatani tradition. However, Sikh Sainis marry by Anand Karaj ritual.\n\nAccording to the Anthropological Survey of India, \"The Saini are endogamous community and observe exogamy at village and gotra level.\" Remarriage after the death of a spouse is permitted nowadays, as is divorce.\n\n\n"}

It is an excellent way of introducing young horses to regular work and teaching them the trust and respect which is the foundation of the relationship with the trainer. It can also be used to good effect to build strength in ridden horses or for rehabilitation after illness or injury. The horse is asked to work on a circle at one end of a longe line, or rein, by a trainer on the ground who guides the horse's movements using rein, whip and voice commands. Longeing is also a critical component of the sport of equestrian vaulting.\n\nThe word is believed to be derived from either the French word \"allonge,\" meaning \"to lengthen\", or the Latin \"longa\" (\"long\"). In both cases, the root word featured spelling with an \"o\" and emphasizes lengthening and extension, so although always pronounced \"\"lungeing\"\", the traditional spelling of the word in English is \"longeing\". This spelling has been used by the majority of past dressage masters who wrote in English, and remains in use by traditional horsemanship organizations in the United States such as the United States Pony Clubs.\n\nThe phonetic \"lungeing\" spelling dates back to the 1800s, but has only become popular since the late 20th century. It is now used by an increasing number of books and magazine articles on the subject and in the United Kingdom, is the spelling both the British Horse Society and the Association of British Riding Schools (ABRS) use in their material. It is also the usual spelling in both New Zealand and Australia, and, since 2009, by the FEI in their equestrian vaulting rules.\n\nLongeing has many benefits for both horses and riders.\n\nFor a young or green (inexperienced) horse, longeing is used to teach a horse to respond to voice commands and the trainer's body language, to accustom them to the feel of a saddle and bridle, and to begin their introduction to the feel of reins and bit pressure. In many training stables, a horse is first introduced on the longe to nearly everything it is going to be asked to do under saddle, including movement at all gaits, response to hand and voice commands (called riding aids), and remaining calm in unusual or stressful situations.\n\nOn horses of any age or level of experience, longeing is used to exercise a horse when it cannot be ridden, or when additional work is needed to develop balance, rhythm, and to improve the horse's gaits. It is also useful to help settle a horse before riding, especially a high-strung horse, a young horse, or a horse that has been confined more than usual. However, longeing for long periods or with the intent to tire a horse out can cause joint strain. It can be used to \"blow off steam\" or \"get the bucks out\" before a rider gets on, though proper turnout or liberty work is a better alternative, because a longeing session is training time, not play time.\n\nLongeing riders is valuable for teaching, as they may develop their seat and position without having to worry about controlling the horse. Classical schools of riding and training, such as the Spanish Riding School, require new riders to work extensively on the longe before they are allowed reins or stirrups, and riders are required to periodically return to longe work to refine their seat and balance.\n\nThe longe line (or longe) is typically about 30 feet (10 m) long, so the longeing circle can have a diameter of up to 60 feet (20 m). It is usually a flat woven webbing made of nylon, cotton, or Dacron. In the natural horsemanship tradition, the longe line is usually made of round cotton rope, and is often much shorter, as short as 15 or 20 feet. In general, cotton longe lines are less likely to burn the trainer's hands than nylon, but nylon is more durable and less likely to break.\n\nIt may have a snap, buckle, or chain on one end to attach to a longeing cavesson or bridle. A chain , although sometimes used with difficult horses, has no subtlety of contact and is quite severe. In most cases, it is best to use a snap-end longe line. Many longe lines have a loop handle at the other end, but this is dangerous to use, as a person's hand can be trapped in the handle and be injured should the horse bolt.\n\nThe longe line takes the place of the rein aids while longeing. It can be held in a rein hold (coming out the bottom of the hand) or a driving hold (coming out the top of the hand), and the extra line is folded back and forth rather than coiled, as coiled line can tighten and trap the trainer's hand or fingers if the horse bolts.\n\nThe whip usually has a stock of 6 feet (1.8 m), with a lash of 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) (although some are longer). The whip is light, easy to handle, and well balanced. It is not safe to use a riding or driving whip for longeing because they are too short to reach the horse without bringing the handler close enough to the horse's hindquarters to risk being kicked by the horse. The longe whip is used as an encouragement to the horse but never as a punishment.\n\nA longeing cavesson (alternate spelling caveson) is the classic headgear specialized for longeing, but in modern times is not the most commonly used equipment. It is a type of headstall with one to three rings on the noseband to which the longe line is attached. The most common point of attachment is the center ring at the top of the cavesson, which allows the horse to go both directions without having to stop and change the adjustment of the line. The two side rings are occasionally used for attachment of the longe line, but more often are used for attachment of side reins or long lines.\n\nThe classic design is made of leather. The noseband is usually metal on top with padding beneath, providing good control of the horse, but no risk of injury to the head. Unlike a bridle, there is no chance of damaging the horse's mouth. Newer designs are made of nylon web, similar to some types of halter, with three rings and fleece padding underneath the noseband, often without the metal component. This style is less bulky, less expensive, and available in a very wide range of sizes, but without adequate stiffness to the noseband, may offer less precise control.\n\nA longeing cavesson may be used with or without a bridle. When used with a bridle containing a snaffle bit, the noseband of the bridle is removed, and the bridle goes over the longeing cavesson, to prevent pinching. The bridle cheekpieces sometimes need to be lengthened so that the bit still rests correctly in the mouth.\n\nWhen fitting a longe cavesson, the noseband must be on the nasal bone of the horse's nose, not on the cartilage. Nosebands that are too low are very uncomfortable for the horse and, in extreme cases, can cause damage to the cartilage if misused. The throatlatch of the cavesson must be snug enough to keep it from slipping over the horse's eye, or from falling off altogether, but not so tight as to restrict the windpipe if the horse flexes its neck properly in response to pressure from the bit and side reins. Some designs replace the throatlatch with a strap that is placed further down the cheek so as to not interfere with the windpipe when adjusted snugly.\n\nOn a well-trained horse, a bridle may be used instead of a longeing cavesson. However, it is possible to injure a horse's mouth if the line is incorrectly attached or misused. Some sensitive horses may react badly to the attachment of the line to the bit, and some classical dressage masters considered this method to be crude.\n\nThe bit used is a snaffle bit. Curb bits, having bit shanks of any kind are dangerous; the line can tangle in them, causing injury to the horse's mouth. When longed off a bridle, the reins are kept out of the way, either by removing them, or by twisting them once or twice over the neck and then running the throatlatch of the bridle under the reins before buckling it.\n\nThe correct method is to run the longe line through the inside bit ring, over the poll, and attach it to the outside bit ring. This method of attaching the line requires it to be changed each time the horse changes direction. This method has a slight gag effect, raising the bit up and applying pressure on the corners of the mouth and placing pressure on the poll, but puts less lateral pressure on the bit. It is best for horses that pull, or when the trainer is longeing a rider, to ensure maximum control of the horse.\n\nIf the longe line is attached just to the inside bit ring, the outside ring can slide through the mouth when the line is pulled and damage the horse's mouth. If the line is run through the inside bit ring, under the chin, and attached to the outside bit ring, the bit can pinch the horse's jaw, and it alters the action of the bit to put pressure on the roof of the horse's mouth. When a method of attachment causes more pain than control, the horse often resists the pressure and will not perform properly.\n\nA halter is used for basic exercise when a longeing cavesson or a bridle is not available. It offers very little control, less finesse, and does not give signals as clearly. When used with a bridle, the halter is placed on over the bridle. This sometimes is done when warming up a horse just prior to competition. The longe line is attached to the inside side ring of the halter noseband on a flat web halter, not the ring under the jaw. If it is attached under the jaw, not only is the halter apt to twist and slip out of place, possibly rubbing the horse in the eye and risking injury, but if the horse is disobedient, the handler has virtually no lateral leverage or control. Some rope halters have knots placed on the noseband and crownpiece that may apply some additional pressure if a longe line is placed under the jaw, which is the only place possible on a rope halter.\n\nHorses' legs are often protected while longeing, as they are more likely to interfere when on a circle. Both bell boots and \"brushing\" or \"splint\" boots are often put on the front legs. Brushing boots are sometimes on the hind legs as well. Polo wraps are sometimes used instead of brushing boots.\n\nA saddle is often worn when a horse is longeing. In these circumstances, it is important that the stirrups do not bang against the horse's side. On an English saddle, the stirrups are \"run up.\" To do this, run up the stirrups as they are kept when the saddle is off the horse, then bring the loop of stirrup leather around the stirrup iron before bringing it under the back branch and attaching looping the end of the leather (with the holes in it) through the stirrup leather keeper. Stirrups on a western saddle cannot be run up, so they are usually tied together under the belly of the horse with a piece of twine or rope, though for a very skittish young horse they also can be thrown up over the top of the saddle and tied down in that fashion.\n\nA surcingle or roller is a padded band that straps around the horse's girth area, and has rings around on its side for side reins, or long reins or other training equipment, such as an overcheck. It may also be used on a young horse to get it used to girth pressure. It may be used with or without an English saddle underneath.\n\nSide reins are usually used for more advanced horses. They give the horse something to take contact with, encourage balance and correct head carriage, help develop self-carriage, and keep the horse from putting its head too low. Side reins may be attached from the bit to the surcingle rings, or from the bit to the billets of the girth.\n\nSide reins are adjusted longer for less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened, and raised higher (from point of shoulder up to the point of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. For green horses, the side reins are adjusted so that the horse can take contact with the bit, but does not have to flex beyond its abilities. A good starting point is to adjust the reins so the green horse carries its head approximately 4 inches in front of the vertical. In any case, the head is not to be pulled behind the vertical.\n\nSide reins are adjusted so they are the same length on either side, or slightly shorter on the inside. Side reins adjusted too tightly can cause a horse to go behind the bit, deaden the mouth and in extreme cases cause the horse to feel trapped, leading to rearing and the possibility that the horse will flip over.\n\nA horse is warmed up and cooled down without the side reins, allowing the neck to stretch down and the back muscles to relax. Side reins are most useful for work in the trot and canter, where the neck, back and hindquarter muscles are engaged. Working a horse in side reins at the walk actually discourages a relaxed, forward-moving gait. Side reins are not used for jumping, as they restrict the use of the neck too much, and may even cause the horse to fall.\n\nWearing gloves when longeing prevents rope burns if the horse pulls the line hard. Proper boots are also necessary, and at a minimum, shoes with an enclosed toe are a must. A helmet is also sometimes worn, especially if the horse tends to kick at the trainer. It is wise not to wear spurs, which can get caught on the line and cause the trainer to trip.\n\nThe longe line takes the place of the rider's rein aids. It may be held like a riding rein, with the line running to the horse held between the fourth and fifth finger, or held like a driving rein, with it running between the thumb and pointer finger. The elbow is softly bent, with the arm at an approximately 90-degree angle. The horse and handler should not pull, jerk, or \"hang\" on the line. Like rein aids while riding, signals are given smoothly and as softly as possible to get the desired response, with aids given by squeezing or turning the hand.\n\nThe longe line traveling from the horse to the hand is held in the hand in which direction the horse is moving (so if the horse is working clockwise to the right, the right hand is the leading hand). The extra longe line is folded, never coiled, in the other hand. If the horse were to take off, a coiled line could tighten around the trainer's hand, dragging the trainer and possibly leading to life-threatening injuries. Large loops could be stepped on or caught on something.\n\n\nThe longe whip takes the place of the rider's legs, asking the horse to move forward or out. It is held with the tip low, pointing towards the horse's hocks, with the lash dragging on the ground. The whip is held in the hand that the horse is not going (so if the horse were going to the right, the whip would be held in the lunger's left hand). The horse is to accept the whip as an aid, and not be fearful. When the handler goes toward the horse to adjust equipment, the lash is caught up and the whip turned backward, under the arm, so that it does not interfere with the horse.\n\n\nThe voice is used in the same manner as when riding. It is used mainly for transitions, praise, or to express displeasure. Although the voice is not commonly used for riding, it is very important in longeing. However, overuse of voice to encourage impulsion will cause a horse to ignore the trainer. Voice commands used in longeing are identical to voice commands used when leading or riding the horse, but more voice commands are used when longeing than at other times. All words used in transitions for longeing are spoken slowly, clearly and each command should be phonetically distinct from and others. For upward transitions the voice might raise to a higher pitch, downward transitions should lower the pitch. A trainer may cluck or make another type of chirping or kissing sound to increase speed or impulsion.\n\n\nIt is safest to longe in an enclosed area. If the horse escapes, it will be easier to catch, and an enclosed area will make him easier to control on the longe. Ideally, a 60 to 70-foot (20-25 m) round pen is used. However, the corner of any enclosed arena or small field may also be used. For safety, it is best if there is no one riding in the longeing area.\n\nThe footing should not be slippery, to help prevent slipping and injuries. The ground should be relatively flat for the horse's balance. The circle should be large (approx. 20 meters), as smaller circles tend to increase strain on the horse's joints and ligaments.\n\nIn the field of natural horsemanship, it is a common practice to work a horse loose in a round pen in diameter. ( feet is considered standard). This is sometimes called \"free longeing\" or work \"at liberty,\" because the horse is asked to travel in a circle and obey human commands, only without a longe line attached. The handler uses voice, body language and a lariat or a longe whip to give commands to the horse, eventually teaching it to speed up, slow down, stop and change direction on command.\n\nA variation of these techniques are also used by circus trainers to train horses and other animals, such as elephants to work in a ring for exhibition purposes. Both single animals and groups of animals can be trained to perform at liberty.\n\nThese types of liberty work are considered schooling disciplines and to simply turn a horse loose in a small pen and make it run around to get exercise is not free longeing.\n\nWork in small circles is stressful on a horse's legs, so it is best to limit a longeing session to about 20 minutes. Gaits should be changed frequently, and the horse should be worked for equal time in both directions so that both sides of the horse are worked evenly and to keep the work interesting for the horse.\n\n\n\n"}

Among the notable shows that have premiered at the Majestic are \"Carousel\" (1945), \"South Pacific\" (1949), \"The Music Man\" (1957), \"Camelot\" (1960), \"A Little Night Music\" (1973), and \"The Wiz\" (1975). It was also the second home of \"42nd Street\" and the third home of \"1776\". The theatre has housed \"The Phantom of the Opera\" since it opened on January 26, 1988. With a record-breaking over 13,300 performances to date, it is currently the longest-running production in Broadway history.\n\nDesigned by architect Herbert J. Krapp, the present-day Majestic was constructed by the Chanin Brothers as part of an entertainment complex including the Theatre Masque, the Royale Theatre, and Lincoln Hotel (now the Row NYC Hotel, and previously the Milford Plaza). It opened on March 28, 1927 with the musical \"Rufus LeMaire's Affairs\". The theater was designed in a Spanish style, with Adam style detailing within the auditorium, a large single balcony, and steep stadium seating in the orchestra section, all under an expansive plaster dome. A large staircase leads patrons up to the orchestra level one story above the expansive street frontage. On the Spanish terracotta and stone facade, ornate loggia mask the fire escapes from the auditorium, mirroring the neighboring St. James Theatre across 44th Street. With 1,681 seats, the Majestic is one of the largest of the Broadway theaters, and has been home to primarily large musicals in its ninety year history. The venue hosted the 50th Tony Awards in 1996, on the set of \"Phantom\".\n\nThe Majestic was purchased by the Shubert brothers during the Great Depression and currently is owned and operated by the Shubert Organization. Both the interior and exterior were designated New York City landmarks in 1987, just prior to the theater's current long-running tenant, \"The Phantom of the Opera\". For \"Phantom\", the theater's stage was expanded and modified extensively to fit the show's complex scenic elements, the Shuberts spending more than $1 million to accommodate the show after considering the Martin Beck and Mark Hellinger theaters with the show's producer Cameron Mackintosh, and moving long-running tenant \"42nd Street\" was moved across the street to the St. James.

{"id": "2143758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143758", "title": "Dynastinae", "text": "Dynastinae\n\nDynastinae or rhinoceros beetles are a subfamily of the scarab beetle family (Scarabaeidae). Other common names – some for particular groups of rhinoceros beetles – include Hercules beetles, unicorn beetles or horn beetles. Over 300 species of rhinoceros beetles are known.\n\nMany rhinoceros beetles are well known for their unique shapes and large sizes. Some famous species are, for example, the Atlas beetle (\"Chalcosoma atlas\"), common rhinoceros beetle (\"Xylotrupes ulysses\"), elephant beetle (\"Megasoma elephas\"), European rhinoceros beetle (\"Oryctes nasicornis\"), Hercules beetle (\"Dynastes hercules\"), Japanese rhinoceros beetle or \"kabutomushi\" (\"Allomyrina dichotoma\"), ox beetle (\"Strategus aloeus\") and the Eastern Hercules beetle (\"Dynastes tityus\").\n\nThe Dynastinae are among the largest of beetles, reaching more than in length, but are completely harmless to humans because they cannot bite or sting. Some species have been anecdotally claimed to lift up to 850 times their own weight. Their common names refer to the characteristic horns borne only by the males of most species in the group. Each has a horn on the head and another horn pointing forward from the center of the thorax. The horns are used in fighting other males during mating season, and for digging. The size of the horn is a good indicator of nutrition and physical health.\n\nThe body of an adult rhinoceros beetle is covered by a thick exoskeleton. A pair of thick wings lie atop another set of membranous wings underneath, allowing the rhinoceros beetle to fly, although not very efficiently, owing to its large size. Their best protection from predators is their size and stature. Additionally, since they are nocturnal, they avoid many of their predators during the day. When the sun is out, they hide under logs or in vegetation to camouflage themselves from the few predators big enough to want to eat them. If rhinoceros beetles are disturbed, some can release very loud, hissing squeaks. The hissing squeaks are created by rubbing their abdomens against the ends of their wing covers. Rhinoceros beetles are relatively resilient; a healthy adult male can live up to 2–3 years. The females rarely live long after they mate.\n\nThese beetles' larval stages can be several years long. The larvae feed on rotten wood and the adults feed on nectar, plant sap and fruit. First, the larvae hatch from eggs and later develop into pupae before they reach adult status (see picture at left). The females lay 50 eggs on average. Contrary to what their size may imply, adult rhinoceros beetles do not eat large amounts, unlike their larvae, which eat a significant amount of rotting wood.\n\nRhinoceros beetles have become popular pets in parts of Asia, due to being relatively clean, easy to maintain, and safe to handle. Also in Asia, male beetles are used for gambling fights. Since males naturally have the tendency to fight each other for the attention of females, they are the ones used for battle. To get the two male beetles to lock in combat, a female beetle is used, or a small noisemaker duplicating the female's mating call.\n\nEntomologist Séverin Tchibozo suggests the larvae contain much more protein (40%), than chicken (20%) and beef (approximately 18%) and they could become a protein source for a large human population.\n\nDr. MinJun Kim, leading a team of engineers in National Science Foundation-funded research, examined the function and aerodynamics of \"Allomyrina dichotoma\", with the help of researchers in Drexel University's Mechanical Engineering Department and in collaboration with Konkuk University in South Korea. Rhinoceros beetles could play a big part in the next generation of aircraft design.\n\nSome species can become major pests, e.g., in tree plantations. Usually though, beetle population densities are not as high as in some other pest insects, and food trees which are typically already sick or dying from some other cause are preferred. Some species' larvae, however, will attack healthy trees or even root vegetables, and when they occur in large numbers, can cause economically significant damage.

Visited by close to 2 million tourists per year, the garden is one of the major attractions of Srirangapatna. Sir Mirza Ismail, the Deewan of Mysore, a man with a penchant for gardens, founded the Brindavan Gardens (Krishnaraja Sagar Dam in particular) and built the Cauvery River high-level canal to irrigate 120,000 acres (490 km) in modern Mandya district. He was inspired by Hyder Ali who had earlier built the Lalbagh Botanical Gardens at Bangalore.\n\nThe garden is maintained by the Cauvery Niravari Nigama (Cauvery Irrigation Corporation), a Government of Karnataka enterprise.

It is adjacent to and south of downtown and Interstate 30, east of Austin Street, north of Corinth Street, and west of the 75 & 345 Overpasses just East of South Good Latimer Expy.\n\nThe Cedars was originally developed in the 1870s with moderately-priced homes, but by the late 19th century the neighborhood had become one of the premier destinations in Dallas, with stately Victorian homes belonging to wealthy businessmen, lawyers, and politicians dotting the streets. The Cedars was also the home of Dallas' Jewish community, and the neighborhood included the Shaareth Israel synagogue. (Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus fame was born in the Cedars.) By the early 20th century, however, light industry and growing population pressures had begun to take the bloom off the neighborhood's rose, and most of the city's wealthiest began to move further north to neighborhoods northeast of downtown. Even as industry, such as the Sears-Roebuck warehouse that now is home of the South Side on Lamar lofts, moved in, fine homes continued to be built, especially for well-to-do members of the Jewish community. But by the 1920s, the massive Victorians of the late 19th century were gone, the synagogue was demolished, and most people moved on. In the 1960s, virtually all of the remaining homes were destroyed by the city for highway projects. Today, only a scant handful of homes (perhaps as few as six) from the neighborhood's original residents survive, none in restored condition.\n\nIn addition to light industry, the area has been a haven for artists, musicians and urban dwellers for over 20 years. It has recently experienced the beginnings of an urban transformation with new townhomes, renovated warehouse lofts and apartments and developments such as DART's Cedars Station, the loft/retail development Southside on Lamar, Opening Bell Coffee & Music Venue Hosts to numerous Local and National Music Acts since March 2003Baby Back Shak the Dallas Police Headquarters, FULL CITY ROOSTER Coffee Roasting Studio, Cedar Performance European Automotive Repair (www.Cedar-Performance.com), Cedars Union, and entertainment venues Alamo Drafthouse, Mac's Southside, Lee Harvey's, Industry Alley Bar, Gilley's Dallas and Poor David's Pub.\n\nIn June 2015, Cedars was the site of a shootout between Dallas Police Department officers and a mentally disturbed man who attacked the police headquarters building.

{"id": "2143806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143806", "title": "Multitude", "text": "Multitude\n\nMultitude is a term for a group of people who cannot be classed under any other distinct category, except for their shared fact of existence. The term has a history of use reaching back to antiquity, but took on a strictly political concept when it was first used by Machiavelli and reiterated by Spinoza. The multitude is a concept of a population that has not entered into a social contract with a sovereign political body, such that individuals retain the capacity for political self-determination. A multitude typically is classified as a quantity exceeding 100. For Hobbes the multitude was a rabble that needed to enact a social contract with a monarch, thus turning them from a multitude into a people. For Machiavelli and Spinoza both, the role of the multitude vacillates between admiration and contempt. Recently the term has returned to prominence as a new model of resistance against global systems of power as described by political theorists Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri in their international best-seller \"Empire\" (2000) and expanded upon in their \"\" (2004). Other theorists recently began to use the term include political thinkers associated with autonomist Marxism and its sequelae, including Sylvère Lotringer, Paolo Virno, and thinkers connected with the eponymous review \"Multitudes\".\n\nThe concept originates in Machiavelli’s \"Discorsi\". It is, however, with Hobbes's recasting of the concept as the war-disposed, dissolute pole of the opposition between a Multitude and a People in \"De Cive\", that Spinoza’s conceptualization seems, according to Negri, contrasted.\n\nThe multitude is used as a term and implied as a concept throughout Spinoza's work. In the \"Tractatus Theologico-Politicus\", for instance, he acknowledges that the (fear of the) power (potentia) of the multitude is the limit of sovereign power (potestas): \"Every ruler has more to fear from his own citizens […] than from any foreign enemy, and it is this 'fear of the masses' [... that is] the principal brake on the power of the sovereign or state.\" The explication of this tacit concept, however, only comes in Spinoza's last and unfinished work known as the \"Political Treatise\":\nIt must next be observed, that in laying foundations it is very necessary to study the human passions: and it is not enough to have shown, what ought to be done, but it ought, above all, to be shown how it can be effected, that men, whether led by passion or reason, should yet keep the laws firm and unbroken. For if the constitution of the dominion, or the public liberty depends only on the weak assistance of the laws, not only will the citizens have no security for its maintenance [...], but it will even turn to their ruin. [...] And, therefore, it would be far better for the subjects to transfer their rights absolutely to one man, than to bargain for unascertained and empty, that is unmeaning, terms of liberty, and so prepare for their posterity a way to the most cruel servitude. But if I succeed in showing that the foundation of monarchical dominion [...], are firm and cannot be plucked up, without the indignation of the larger part of an armed multitude, and that from them follow peace and security for king and multitude, and if I deduce this from general human nature, no one will be able to doubt, that these foundations are the best and the true ones.\n\nThe concept of the multitude resolves the tension that scholars have observed in Spinoza’s political project between the insistence on the benign function of sovereignty (as witnessed in the quotation above) and the insistence on individual freedom. It is, we see here, a truly revolutionary concept, and it is not difficult to see why Spinoza’s contemporaries (and, as for instance Étienne Balibar has implied, even Spinoza himself) saw it as a dangerous political idea.\n\nNegri describes the multitude in his \"The Savage Anomaly\" as an unmediated, revolutionary, immanent, and positive collective social subject which can found a \"nonmystified\" form of democracy (p. 194). In his more recent writings with Michael Hardt, however, he does not so much offer a direct definition, but presents the concept through a series of mediations. In \"Empire\" it is mediated by the concept of Empire (the new global constitution that Negri and Hardt describe as a copy of Polybius's description of Roman government):\n\nNew figures of struggle and new subjectivities are produced in the conjecture of events, in the universal nomadism [...] They are not posed merely against the imperial system—they are not simply negative forces. They also express, nourish, and develop positively their own constituent projects. [...] This constituent aspect of the movement of the multitude, in its myriad faces, is really the positive terrain of the historical construction of Empire, [...] an antagonistic and creative positivity. The deterritorializing power of the multitude is the productive force that sustains Empire and at the same time the force that calls for and makes necessary its destruction.\n\nThey remain however vague as to this \"positive\" or \"constituent\" aspect of the Multitude:\n\nCertainly, there must be a moment when reappropriation [of wealth from capital] and selforganization [of the multitude] reach a threshold and configure a real event. This is when the political is really affirmed—when the genesis is complete and self-valorization, the cooperative convergence of subjects, and the proletarian management of production become a constituent power. [...] We do not have any models to offer for this event. Only the multitude through its practical experimentation will offer the models and determine when and how the possible becomes real.\n\nIn their sequel \"\" they still refrain from a clear definition of the concept but approach the concept through mediation of a host of \"contemporary\" phenomena, most importantly the new type of postmodern war they postulate and the history of post-WWII resistance movements. It remains a rather vague concept which is assigned a revolutionary potential without much theoretical substantiation apart from a generic potential of love.\n\nSylvère Lotringer has criticized Negri and Hardt's use of the concept for its ostensible return to the dialectical dualism in the introduction to Paulo Virno's \"A Grammar of the Multitude\" (see external links).\n\n\n"}

With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, Pandi is now included in the Greater Manila's built-up area which reaches San Ildefonso, Bulacan at its northernmost part.\n\nPandi is one of the youngest towns in Bulacan. During the Spanish Regime, Pandi was a part of the political jurisdiction of the town of Meycauayan City including the towns of San Jose del Monte, Bocaue, Marilao, Valenzuela, Obando, Santa Maria, Balagtas, it also formed part of the vast Hacienda Santa Maria de Pandi, which included the towns of Santa Maria and Balagtas and parts of Angat and Bustos.

Likewise, it is on this site where the 'Republic of Real de Kakarong de Sili' of 1896, one of the first Philippine revolutionary republics was established. It was in Kakarong de Sili, which about 6,000 Katipuneros from various towns of Bulacan headed by Brigadier General Eusebio Roque, a mysticist (albolaryo) better known as \"Maestrong Sebio or Dimabungo\" - List of Filipino Generals in the Philippine Revolution of 1896 and the Filipino-American War of 1899 that the Kakarong Republic was organized shortly after the Cry of Pugad Lawin referred to as 'The Cry of Balintawak' - Andres Bonifacio a Filipino nationalist and revolutionalist who led in 'The Cry of Balintawak'.\nThe 'Kakarong Republic' was the first revolutionary government established in Bulacan to overthrow the Spaniards. These significant event have been included as of one of the attributes in the seal of the province of Bulacan.\n\nAccording to available records including the biography of General Gregorio del Pilar entitled \"Life and Death of a Boy General\" written by Teodoro Kalaw, former director of the National Library of the Philippines, an improvised fort was constructed at 'Kakarong de Sili' It had streets, an independent police force, a musical band, a factory of falconets, bolos and repair shops for rifles and cartridges. The 'Kakarong Republic' had a complete set of officials with Canuto Villanueva as Supreme Chief and 'Maestrong Sebio'- Eusebio Roque as Brigadaire General of the Army. The fort was attacked and totally destroyed on January 1, 1897 by a large Spanish force headed by \"General Olaguer-Feliu\". Gen. Gregorio del Pilar was only a lieutenant at that time and 'The Battle of Kakarong de Sili' was his first \"baptism of fire\". This was where he was first wounded and escaped to nearby barangay 'Manatal'. After the Battle of Kakarong de Sili mysticist Eusebio Roque were arrested and transferred to Bulakan town where the seat of Alcaldia Mayor located and he was sentenced to death.\n\nThe Kakarong Lodge No. 168 of the 'Legionarios del Trabajo' in memory of the 1,200 Katipuneros who perished in the battle erected a monument of the Inang Filipina Shrine - \"Mother Philippines Shrine\" in 1924 in the barrio of Kakarong. The actual site of the 'Battle of Kakarong de Sili' belongs to the administrative and geographical jurisdiction of Town of Bigaa and it was given to Pandi in 1946. The site is now a part of the barangay of 'Real de Kakarong'. No less than one of the greatest generals in the Philippines' history, General Emilio Aguinaldo who became first Philippine president visited this sacred ground in the late fifties.\n\nThe independence of Pandi as a new town of Bulacan was through the efforts of Mamerto Carpio Bernardo - (The Father of Pandi, Bulacan). During his term as mayor of Balagtas, he worked for the independence of Pandi as a town. Matias B. Salvador become the first mayor after the town gained independence in 1946 from its mother town Balagtas formerly named Bigaa, under the Presidential Decree of President Sergio Osmeña the 4th president of the country.\n\nPandi is located at the center of four adjoining towns of Bulacan Province: Santa Maria; Bustos; Angat; and Balagtas. The land area are mostly rice fields devoted for planting crops and agriculture. Some barrios of the town are covered by irrigation system coming from Angat Dam on the Angat River. There are many little rivers that branch out from this river that become estuaries. Some little rivers provide livelihood by fanning gold. The biggest river is Bunsuran River that empties itself to the Philippine Sea. Along the side of the rivers are banana plantations thriving naturally and many taro plants.\n\nPandi is rich in many natural brooks coming from the mainland itself. In some remote areas the lands are still covered by bamboo trees that naturally thrive and multiplies. Some lands privately owned have mango plantations. In some areas that are privately owned are rock deposits being used for housing materials. The eastern area of Poblacion is gifted by the natural panoramic beauty of the scenery of Sierra Madre Mountains in Luzon. Owing to this the morning climate is always cloudy and cool in some areas of the town proper of Pandi, Bulacan. Some of the natural variations in topography of Pandi land areas have been evened out due to the urbanization of the town. The town's central area has been altered substantially by commercial establishments.\n\nThe prevailing climatic conditions in the municipality is categorized into two types: wet season and dry season.\n\nPandi is subdivided into 22 barangays:\n\nIn the , the population of Pandi, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nMajority of the population of 'Pandienos' are native to Pandi whose roots can be traced back from the neighboring towns of Balagtas, Bulacan, Bocaue, Bulacan and Santa Maria, Bulacan. Some families are intermarriage between immigrants from Ilocos Region and as far as Nueva Ecija during earlier periods. The most recent immigrants are from Luzon and Visayas islands, and Bicol. The population speaks Tagalog and it is the medium of instruction in schools, as well as Kapampangan and English.\n\nThe majority of the population are Christians. Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion in the municipality and has two parishes: Immaculate Conception Parish in Poblacion town proper and Santo Cristo Parish in baranggay 'Siling Bata'. Other religious groups with strong presence in the municipality are the following: Members Church of God International or Ang Dating Daan, Iglesia ni Cristo, Jehovah's Witness, Jesus Is Lord Church, Iglesia Evangelica Metodista En Las Islas Filipinas (IEMELIF) and other Evangelical or \"Born-Again\" groups, as well as Pentecostals.

Paombong is not wealthy as its neighbor towns of Malolos and Hagonoy at time and it did not sustain its township and it was degraded again as barrio and being a visita in 1638.\n\nIn 1639 Paombong was turned over to the Town of Calumpit from its mother town Malolos and in 1649 it was returned again to Malolos but on November 28, 1650 it was finally given its own civil government establishing Paombong its full township with Don Agustin Mananghaya as its first Gobernadorcillo.\n\nIn the middle of the 1750s, Paombong grew into a modest community from what was once a cogon land inhabited by a handful of Tagalogs. as its first gobernadorcillo.\n\nDuring the Revolution against Spain, Paombong’s coastal area, more specifically, Barangays Masukol and Binakod, played a significant role in Philippine History being known encounter sites between Spanish soldiers and Katipuneros. Maloleño General Isidoro \"matanglawin\" Torres used to retreat with his troops to Barangay Masukol and Barangay Binakod to avoid the advancing Spanish forces. In the latter village, he organized the Katipunan militia of Paombong.\n\nIt is from these encounters, in fact, that Barangays Binakod and Masukol earned their present names. In one encounter, Binakod was where the enemies where \"fenced in\" (binakuran) and it was in Masukol where they were eventually \"cornered\" (nasukol) and defeated.\n\nIn 1898, the first civilian in the person of Don Victorio de Leon headed the Municipal Government until 1900. The seat of the local government was first established at the ground floor of the Paombong Church Convent then popularly called \"zaguan\". It was later transferred to the house of Numerino Lindayag located in Poblacion, then was transferred to the location of the present Rural Health Center I. Eventually it was moved to the place where it is presently located which since has been the seat of the Municipal Government since then. In 1941, the head of the Municipal Government was later on called Municipal Mayor.\n\nPaombong is situated south-west of the province of Bulacan, with a total land area of 46.34 square kilometers. It is bounded by the municipality of Calumpit on the north, Malolos City on the east, municipality of Hagonoy on the west and Manila Bay on the south. The municipality is approximately 47 kilometers from Metro Manila, it is a by-pass town and can be accessed via North Luzon Expressway and MacArthur Highway.\n\nPaombong is politically subdivided into 14 barangays (6 urban, 8 rural):\n\n\nIn the , the population of Paombong, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nJust as the national government, the municipal government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.\n\nThe executive branch is composed of the mayor and the barangay captain for the barangays. The legislative branch is composed of the Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly), Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the Sangguniang Kabataan for the youth sector.\n\nThe seat of Government is vested upon the Mayor and other elected officers who hold office at the Town hall. The Sanguniang Bayan is the center of legislation.\n\nThe following officials were elected on May 13, 2019 to serve a three-year term.\n\n\n\n\nMajor Industries\n\nMajor Products\n\n\nPublic land transport in Paombong is served by provincial buses, Jeepneys, for-hire Tricycles, Pedicabs, and UV Express AUVs. Maritime transport is served by motorboats. Both First North Luzon Transit and Baliwag Transit buses passes thru the municipality.\n\nThere is one hospital operating in Paombong and a main rural health care center unit. The San Pascual Baylon Maternity Hospital, situated at Barangay Santo Niño that offers secondary healthcare services. And the main rural health care center is one of the district rural health center owned and controlled by the Provincial Government of Bulacan. It offers primary healthcare services which also includes laboratory and dental and maternity services.\n\n\nElementary Schools\n\nHigh Schools\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nWith the expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's built-up area which reaches as far north as San Ildefonso, Bulacan.\n\nLike many towns in Bulacan, Plaridel has its niche in Philippine history as the site of the Battle of Quingua during the Philippine-American War as part of the defense of the First Philippine Republic against the Northern Campaign of the American Army. The battle, manned by Pablo Tecson—Lt. Colonel Pablo Ocampo Tecson of San Miguel, Bulacan—under Gregorio del Pilar on the side of the First Philippine Republic, led to the death of Col. John Stotsenberg of the American Army on April 23, 1899. A marker now stands at the site of the battle in Barangay Agnaya.\n\nPlaridel's history can be traced through records back to 1581 in the early years of the Spanish colonization. The Augustinian friars from Malolos Convent discovered a vast forest in 1581 then named as Binto; this would later be known as Quingua. As per the history of the Parish of St. James the Apostle, 2001 issue, Quingua was established by the Augustinian Friars of Malolos who initially named it \"Encomienda Binto\" (Barangay Bintog got its name from this settlement). They built a \"visita\" (chapel of ease) and placed it under the jurisdiction of Fray Mateo Mendoza, the prior of Malolos.\n\nThe visita of Binto was elevated to an independent parish named Parroquia de Santiago Apostol, and the whole of Quingua was separated from Malolos and was created as a new pueblo on September 27, 1602.\n\nPlaridel is surrounded with the rivers of Angat, Bulacan and Tabang River, both of which run through the town. The Angat River, otherwise known as Bulacan River, flows directly to Calumpit, Bulacan, meeting the Pampanga River. The Tabang River, a tributary with adjoining intersections dividing the middle of the present poblacion of Plaridel, flows to the Manila Bay after passing through the towns of Guiguinto and Bulakan. The water of this river was called \"tabáng\" to refer to its fresh water.\n\nInitially very few people lived in the town, and most were closely related. Each group had a leader called \"tandis\". Different groups spoke different languages; Pampango, Pangasinan, Ilocano and Tagalog. From Malolos, the friar curate frequently visited the place, preaching the Catholic faith, using the \"balsa\" or bamboo raft as his means of transportation. The missionaries decided to clear the land and establish settlements, from which they could work to bring unity to the people. They needed ideas to bring this about, so each \"tandis\" drew up a plan to pursue. The groups of people labored, so much so that when the priest returned seven years later, he found the area completely cleared. The priests's party inquired among the natives as to whom the credit should go, and the Pampangos exclaimed, \"Quing wawa\". Thereafter, every now and then, to every question of the friars the people would reply \"Quing wa\". As a consequence, the place had come to be referred to as Quingua.\n\nDuring the presidency of Manuel L. Quezon, the then \"Alcalde\", or Town Mayor, of Quinga, Jose J. Mariano, took the initiative of renaming the town. Congressman Pedro Magsalin, a friend of the Alcalde, sponsored the bill changing the name of the town from Quingua to Plaridel. The bill was passed by the Philippine Congress and was approved by the President, and on December 29, 1936 the town was renamed as 'Plaridel', in honor of the great hero of Bulacan, Marcelo H. del Pilar. The celebrations that followed were attended by political luminaries of the time, including Speaker Gil Montilla, Congressman Magsalin, Nicolas Buendia, Eulogio Rodriguez, Elpidio Quirino and Governor José Padilla, Sr.\n\nNotable families from Plaridel include the Vergel de Dios family (originally from Baliuag and that donated the public market of the town), the Castros, Vistans, Sayos, Garcías, and San Diegos.\n\nPlaridel is divided into 19 barangays. In 1954, sitio Mayamot in Barrio Banga was changed to Bagong Silang while a sitio in the eastern part of barrio Tabang, called Bagong Silang, was created.\n\nIn the , the population of Plaridel, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe Plaridel Church was initially a mission chapel built by the Augustinians in Malolos made of light materials. The Chapel was located near River at Lumang Bayan and transferred to present site. It is clearly evident why the said Barrio named Lumang Bayan means-Old Poblacion. From 1590 to 1602, Quingua was administered by Friar Curate from Malolos Church which close at hand.\n\nThe present church was built in 1602 and established as the town church of the newly created Pueblo de Quingua.\n\nPlaridel is one of the earliest settlement to be established at around 1590 as Encomienda. Its Parish Church of Santiago Apostol has one of the unique Moorish architectural style among the Augustinian Churches in the province. It was here that the money and jewels of san Agustin in Intramuros, Manila were kept during British Occupation in 1762-63.\n\nThe church is small and its two level facade is bare. However, the crowning pediment is elaborate consisting of a pair of volutes with the inner space filled with triangular patterns and floral embellishments that first glance can be mistaken as having a Moorish influence because of the minaret like dome formed. In between the volutes are a series of spaced relieves of cherubs, ramilletes, two saints including that of St. Agustin and the pierced heart which is the symbol of the Agustinia Order. The octagonal and tapering belltower on the other hand sits on a quadrilateral base and rises 4 levels.\n\nThe Parish Church of Santiago Apostol is the location of GMA Network's \"Fantaserye Darna\" (2009), \"Zaido\" (2007), \"Iglot\" (2011) and afternoon drama series, \"Nita Negrita\" (2011), \"Broken Vow\" (2012). And the Judy Ann Santos-Sarah Geronimo Movie \"Hating Kapatid\" in July 2010.\n\nAnd recently, ABS-CBN's drama anthology \"Maalaala mo kaya: Toga\", starring Albie Casiño and Erich Gonzales and the episode of Police Uniform\" starring Empress and Joseph Marco.\n\nSalubong Festival celebrated annually every December 29. It's called \"salubong\" or \"welcome\" because they welcome the St. James the Greater's equestrian replica from Sipat. It's also called \"Horse festival\" because they paraded calesas, tiburins (non-roofed calesa) and an only riding on the horse (equestrian) and holding a horse racing in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143818", "title": "Pulilan", "text": "Pulilan\n\n', officially the ' (), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is famous for its Carabao Festival where carabaos are paraded and kneel as they pass through San Isidro Labrador Parish Church, in honor to the town's patron saint, San Isidro Labrador.\n\nMany years ago, Pulilan was primarily a little-known rural town in the northern part of Bulacan where its economy heavily dependent on farming and poultry raising. Most of the population committed their entire lives on farming as their livelihood. Today, the town is moving towards commercialization and industrialization as it is becoming one of the major growth-rate area and center of commerce and industry in the province.\n\nBecause of the major economic growth, due to presence of commercial establishments, real estates, industrial plants and major road projects. Pulilan has experienced increased in the total gross income in the past few years. The town's income in year 2016 was P323.86 million, an increase of P69.27 million from its previous income in 2014. It surpass the income of fifteen municipalities in \nBulacan such as San Miguel, Bocaue, Plaridel, Hagonoy and Calumpit.\n\nWith the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now included in Manila's built up area which reaches San Ildefonso in its northernmost part.\n\nIn the beginning, Pulilan is neither its name nor a town. History has it that the place is a marshy or swampland which forms part of Pampanga, along the Candaba Bay. Because of the vastness of its area, Pulilan was created out of the districts of Baliuag and Quingua (now Plaridel) and coming from the Pampango word \"\"Kengwa\"\", meaning on the other side of the shore or kabilang ibayo. In 1794, the place was named \"San Isidro\" by the missionary Augustinian friars in honor of San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of the farmers. On January 20, 1796, it was called \"Pulilan\". There are no written records how the place is named Pulilan. But legend has it that is derived from \"Pulo ng Ilan\", literally, clusters of small communities or isles. According to Antoon Postma in his \"The Laguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI) – A Valuable Philippine Document\" this copperplate with inscription discovered at Lumbang River near the Laguna Lake area in Laguna dates back to 900 A.D. In this inscription was mentioned the name \"Puliran\", as the old name for southeastern lake area. The toponyms or place names Puliran is Pulilan, Bulacan and Pulilan is in Laguna de Bay. However, Mr. Postma is convinced in his studies that Pulilan in the LCI is the Pulilan along the Angat River, in the Province of Bulacan, north of Manila.\n\nThe first time Pulilan was settled was unknown but if existing records of the towns of Calumpit and Baliuag, between which the town lies, be made a basis, it could be deduced that in the early part of the 17th century it could have had a sprinkling of settlers. However, the ancient town of Pulilan was first documented as Puliran in the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, a pre-colonial oldest document of Philippines written in 900 A.D in Indianized script. The native population at the time of the document were ruled by the sovereign Lord Ka-Sumuran (see Laguna Copperplate Inscription).\n\nDuring Spanish regime, an Augustian fray, Fray Vicente Villamanzaro, was made to declare the settlement of a town on January 20, 1796. It was assigned a patron saint, San Isidro Labrador, after whose name he wanted the town identified. On this time, the head of the town was called Kapitan. It was only in 1819 that Pulilan has as its first Kapitan, Kapitan Francisco Paltao. In 1898, the first Presidente Municipal was Froilan Cahiwat. In 1904, when Anacleto Batongbacal was the Presidente Municipal, Pulilan was annexed to Quingua and became its sitio. In 1908, as the Pulilenos rallied behind the candidacy of their son Adriano Salvador, he was elected Presidente Municipal of Quinqua. Then in 1909, representations were made by Eugenio Tiangco, Hilario Esguerra, Adriano Salvador and others with Governor Teodoro Sandico to separate Pulilan from Quingua. It was granted. Pulilan then became a town, with Eugenio Tiangco as its Presidente. In 1946, Catalino Flores was appointed as the first Mayor of Pulilan.\n\nFrom the Spanish time to American occupation and lately the Japanese era, many sons of the town of Pulilan shed their blood. After long march to freedom, Pulilenos started to build from its small beginnings and from then on made a great stride in politics, economy, social standing and in other fields. The influence of the Spanish, American and Japanese occupations, have in a measure, contributed to the promotion of their welfare, but the Pulileños, as they are known, treasure their great heritage. San Isidro Labrador or Saint Isidore the Laborer, the patron saint of the farmers, is the patron saint of the town as well. The traditional date of his liturgical feast, which through not included in the General Roman Calendar has been celebrated for centuries in several countries and diocese is May 15. However, it is in the 14th day of May that Pulileños (people of Pulilan) celebrate the feast in honor of their saint by parading carabaos and making them kneel in front of the church as a sign of respect for their patron saint of farmers. Also included in the parade are cows, horses, street folk dancers, marching bands and floats of commercial establishments of the town.\n\nPulilan is one of the 21 towns of Bulacan province, located in about its center—from north to south. It lies 50 kilometres north-west of Manila, the capital city of the country and 20 kilometres (31 mi) away from the Malolos, the capital of the province.

The municipality will also be a beneficiary of P24.4-billion Bulacan Bulk Water Supply Project (BBWSP) as it will soon provide additional water supply to its water district.\n\nCommunication Services\n\nPhilippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), Digital Telecommunications Philippines (DIGITEL), Smart Communications and DATELCOM are the main landline telephone service provider in Pulilan while the three major cellular companies here are Smart Communications, Globe Telecom and Sun Cellular. Telegraph and express mail services are being provided by the municipal post office in Barangay Poblacion and private companies like LBC, Western Union, etc.\nEducation had been a priority in Pulilan. It is evidently shown in having a literacy rate of 99%. The number of households that are literate is 16,832 out of 17,002, which are able to read and write a simple message in any language or dialect.\n\nPulilan also had become an educational hub within the province. As it hosts numerous public and private-owned school where many of its constituents and neighboring locals went to study. As of 2016, there are 16 public schools in Pulilan. Several private schools can also be found in the municipality. Most of which offers primary and secondary education. There are also 5 tertiary institutions in the municipality.\n\nIn 2013, Bulacan State University (BulSU) was established in Barangay Paltao where it started to operate an extension program aligned in education courses. While, Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) resides in the former municipal hall building in Barangay Poblacion. There are also technical / vocational schools and training centers here.\n\nThe private schools in Pulilan are members of Bulacan Private Schools Association (BULPRISA). On the other hand, all primary and secondary schools in the municipality are under the supervision of Department of Education (DepEd) Schools Division of Bulacan.\n\nAs of 2010, there are 25 medical facilities as well as 2 government operated rural health units that provide healthcare services in the municipality. Three of which are hospitals and that include the following: Our Lady of Mercy General Hospital (OLMGH) in Longos, The Good Shepherd Hospital in Poblacion and F.M. Cruz Orthopedic & Gen. Hospital in Santo Cristo. Several clinics can also be found in the municipality.\n\nIn the area of peace and order, Pulilan is one of the more peaceful towns in the province. The crime rate is very minimal. Pulilan has a crime solution efficiency of 90.90% and an average crime rate of 1.8. It ranks third in the crime solution and in peace and order in Bulacan. As of 2010, the municipality is being served by 30 policemen and 9 firemen.\n\n\n\n\n"}

There were only about 3,000 inhabitants. The early inhabitants were people from neighboring towns and provinces who preferred to settle in this place because of its good agricultural prospects.\n\nWhen the Spaniards came, the name Bulak was changed to Hacienda San Juan de Dios because 15,500 hectares of grazing and farming grounds were claimed by the friars. The people were told to pay tribute. Proceeds from the rentals were used to finance the operation of the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Manila. The Spanish friars, though antagonistic toward the Filipinos, admired the beauty of the natural scenery. They changed the name to Hacienda Buenavista (which means beautiful scenery in Spanish).\n\nAs the population grew, a chapel was constructed under the parochial jurisdiction of San Rafael. In 1809, Father Juan dela Rosa was named the first Filipino priest of the town. He held the position until 1811. He was responsible for changing the name Bulak to San Ildefonso in honor of Alfonso XII, then the king of Spain, and San Ildefonso, its patron saint. By the time it was given this name, a tribunal was created finally making it a town in 1877. Between 1905 and 1906, San Ildefonso was merged with San Miguel due to its low income and inability to finance its expenditures in operating the local government.\n\nAs years went by, more and more people were induced to live in the town. The growth of population promoted an increase of income. The town became capable of meeting its expenses so it ceased being a barrio of San Miguel and became once again an independent town.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in 1942 the mansion Bahay na Pula of the Ilusorio family was confiscated by the Imperial Japanese Army and used as barracks and became a place where local so-called comfort women were forced to work.\n\nSan Ildefonso is politically subdivided into 36 barangays (6 urban, 30 rural).\n\nIn the , the population of San Ildefonso, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe town has numerous public schools offering elementary and high school education.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the third largest municipality by area in the province after Doña Remedios Trinidad and Norzagaray.\n\nThe municipality of San Miguel de Mayumo was established in 1763 by Carlos Agustin Maniquiz, Maria Juana Puno - wife of Carlos Agustin Maniquiz and Miguel Pineda, with Pineda as the first town mayor of San Miguel. Miguel Pineda was a native of Angat, Bulacan who decided to settle permanently in the barrio of San Bartolome (now named Barangay Tartaro). He found the place ideal for hunting and was later chosen as the leader of other settlers. He formed an alliance with Mariano Puno, the recognized leader of the adjacent prosperous village called Santo Rosario (now named Barangay Mandile). \n\nThe town was previously part of Pampanga, hence San Miguel’s culture having Kapampangan influence. In 1848, the town and the neighbouring barrios, which were then part of Pampanga, were added to the territory of the Province of Bulacan.\n\nThere are two accounts on the origin of the town's name:\n\nDuring the Philippine Revolution in 1897, newly appointed Governor-General Fernando Primo de Rivera decided to crush Emilio Aguinaldo and his troops in Cavite, but Aguinaldo fled to Batangas and joined forces with Gen. Miguel Malvar. The Spaniards continue their pursuit but the troops outwitted them by going to the province of Morong (now Rizal) and finally to Biak-na-Bato in San Miguel, Bulacan. Aguinaldo made the mountain caves into his headquarters.\n\nBiak-na-Bato (21.17 km² in the villages of Kalawakan and Talbak in Doña Remedios Trinidad town and the villages of Biak-na-Bato and Sibul) served as one of the camps of the revolutionary Katipunan forces during the Philippine Revolution. It was declared a national park by Manuel L. Quezon on Nov. 16, 1937 through Proclamation No. 223.\n\nDuring World War II, Japanese Imperial ground troops entered and occupied the town municipality of San Miguel on 1942. Local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary units retreated into the nearby mountains to become the Bulakeño guerrilla resistance against the Japanese occupation forces until the province's liberation.\n\nSan Miguel was the largest town in Bulacan until September 13, 1977 when Doña Remedios Trinidad, the current largest municipality of Bulacan, was established under \"Presidential Decree No. 1196\" during the term of President Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nOn August 26, 2007, residents at the foot of the Biak-na-Bato mountains petitioned president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to declare the mountains protected areas to stop marble quarrying and mining there.\n\nThe town of San Miguel is bounded by Nueva Ecija Province in the northernmost area, Pampanga Province in the west, the town is bounded by two provinces with land borders. The town of San Ildefonso, Bulacan lies next to San Miguel in the southernmost area, Doña Remedios Trinidad in the eastmost area which also borders San Rafael and Angat. San Miguel then was the biggest municipality in the province of Bulacan before some areas were taken and annexed to Doña Remedios Trinidad during the term of Ferdinand Marcos. The geographic nature of the town is diversified and multi-faceted, rich in nature's beauty like waterfall, rivers, caves, few mountains, hilly areas and springs. The mainland are plain agricultural lands, some part of which was substantially eroded due to commercialization and urbanization. \n\nThe prevailing climatic conditions in the municipality is categorized into two types: Wet season and dry season.\n\nSan Miguel is administratively subdivided into 49 barangays.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe San Juan de Dios Church still stands as the silent witness of the bloody battles that the Filipino insurgents fought during the Philippine Revolution of 1896. This church was used as military barracks for almost three days, after the insurgents had destroyed all papers and documents they found in the convents. When the Spanish Cazadores learned of these rebellious activities, they entered the church and fought the insurgents. The combatants fought heavily inside the church to a point that blood was spilled all over the church floor. The patio in front of the church was littered by dead bodies of Filipino insurgents. The gobernadorcillo ordered people to dig a common grave near the church for the bodies of the insurgents.\n\nThe Americans succeeded the Spaniards with their policy of benevolent assimilation. Schools were established as a potent factor for pacification. In 1903, schools were opened in San Rafael. The municipal building was used as a school house. Since then, with the supervision of the American administrators, San Rafael has enjoyed the education and the progress which was denied to them during the three–century rule of the Spaniards.\n\nIn 1899, the Americans incorporated the town to Baliwag when Baliwag was intended to be the Provincial Capital of Bulacan. However, due to a number of petitions of the people of San Rafael, especially when the plan to make Baliwag the capital of Bulacan did not materialize, the Americans where convinced to separate San Rafael as an independent town from Baliwag. Mr. Julian V. Valte was appointed to be the first Presidente Municipal of San Rafael, and Mr. Emilio Reyes was the last.\n\nIn the year 1924 and 1927, with the help of some influential men, the Spaniards were able to get the signatures of the land owners of San Rafael and San Ildefonso to an agreement purporting to show their willingness to donate their lands to the Hospital of San Juan de Dios.\n\nThus the town of San Rafael and San Ildefonso became properties of the hospital and started to be called Hacienda de Buenavista until 1944, when it got back its original name.\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Philippines was invaded by the Empire of Japan in December 1941 shortly after Japan's declaration of war upon the United States of America, which controlled the Philippines at the time and possessed important military bases there. The combined American-Filipino army was defeated by April 1942.\n\nIn May, 1942, the Japanese government opened schools and introduced the teaching of Nippon-go. As part of its war drive, Japanese propaganda included phrases like \"Asia for the Asians!\" and talked about the perceived need to liberate Asian countries from imperialist powers. Similarly, the Philippines were propagandized about \"American exploitation,\" \"American Imperialism,\" and \"American tyranny,\" and blame was laid on the United States for starting the war. They were assured that the American forces would not return and that they were not Japan's enemies. The effect of this was considerably undermined by the actions of the Japanese Army, and the Filipinos soon waited for the return of the Americans to free them from the Japanese. Japanese education condemned anything American, tried to infuse Japanese culture and to teach Filipinos the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under the Japanese influence.\n\nSocio–economic, educational and religious programs were largely non-existent. The people were deprived of property, food, supplies and shelter. They were forced or resorted to eat camote, wore jute sacks and tattered clothes. The people of San Rafael evacuated to Upig, Licheria, Coral na Bato and Camachile. Schools were closed and the church was ordered to stop performing its religious duties.\n\nGuerrilla resistance against the Japanese continued throughout the war. Uncaptured Filipino army units, a communist insurgency and supporting American agents all played a role in the resistance. The people of San Rafael refused to be subjected to Japanese authority and they organized and joined small guerrilla bands and harassed the units of the Japanese army stationed in the town whenever there was a chance to do so. These small, organized guerrillas in San Rafael later became members of BMA (Bulacan Military Area).\n\nWhen the American forces landed in Leyte in October, 1944, the Japanese became more brutal. Hundreds met their death in the hands of the enemy. One cruel incident occurred at Barrio Pulo. Men and women who were assembled where tied together, dynamites were strapped to many of them and these were later detonated by the Japanese captors. A lone survivor, Marcelo Mangahas, told the world of the gory incident. Other atrocities followed. However, the unity of the people of San Rafael and the heroism of the Filipino soldiers and guerrillas prevented further casualties and destruction. When the Americans arrived, they found San Rafael liberated by the courageous guerrillas with the Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 32nd, 35th and 36th Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiment that were mostly from San Rafael.\n\nLocal Filipino troops of the 32nd, 35th and 36th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary liberated the town in San Rafael, Bulacan and aided the guerrillas of the Bulacan Military Area (BMA) and defeated Japanese soldiers and aftermath in World War II.\n\nSan Rafael is politically subdivided into 34 barangays (5 urban, 29 rural).\n\nIn the , the population of San Rafael, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nThe 8 Waves Waterpark & Hotel is the prime resort of the Town, and is one of the biggest in the Philippines. The Big Rock Farm Resort is another notable resort of the Town which is located in Barangay Coral na Bato. The Malangaan Cave and Spring, located in Barangay Tukod is a large cave untouched by quarry operations in San Rafael, Bulacan and according to the locals of the barangay, it was once a hiding place of guerillas during World War II.\n\nEvery year, the town celebrates its Angel Festival in honor of their 2nd patron saint, Saint Raphael, together their town's pride, the Angel Festival, which attracts many tourists every year. It is a colorful celebration in honor of the Seven Archangels. This is held every 29 September.\n\nThis is highlighted by a parade participated by children from the public and private schools in San Rafael. More than a thousand children in angel costumes in the street make it look like heaven has come down to the town of San Rafael. This is followed by an interpretative dancing competition by all participant schools. The Angel Festival was started last September 29, 2002 through the initiative of the San Juan de Dios Parish and the San Rafael Tourism Council.\n\n"}

In 1975, he worked for the National Wrestling Alliance and Jim Crockett Promotions as a referee. By the 1980s, Young was the Senior Referee for Jim Crockett Promotions and refereed most of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship matches. In this role, Young officiated many famous matches throughout professional wrestling history, including several classic bouts between Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat. He had a unique style of urgently sliding to the mat to officiate the pinfall. He often employed strong facial expressions and creative body language to sell wrestler's moves, express pain if he was attacked, or show frustration over the villains' cheating.\n\nOn November 28, 1989, while refereeing a match between Mike Rotunda and Tommy Rich at a World Championship Wrestling TV taping in Atlanta, Georgia, Young suffered a career-ending injury. After an angered Rich threw Young out of his way, Young's head bounced off the rope and he was left legitimately incapacitated for the remainder of the match. The match aired on December 9, 1989. This resulted in a broken neck and the end of his full-time career as a referee. Following the injury, Young drove a parts truck for a Toyota dealership and made home deliveries for prescription drugs.\n\nIn 1998, Young appeared briefly in the World Wrestling Federation as part of a NWA invasion angle. He attends wrestling reunion shows and still occasionally referees, including special matches such as the Rock and Roll Express vs. Midnight Express matches. In 2010, at Ring of Honor's Big Bang! pay-per-view, Young served outside the ring as a special guest referee for the ROH World Championship match. He also officiated the George South Battle Royal at WrestleCade IV in 2015.\n\nYoung has been married to his wife Pam for over forty years. They have six children and two grandchildren.

{"id": "2143835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143835", "title": "9M14 Malyutka", "text": "9M14 Malyutka\n\nThe 9M14 Malyutka (; \"Little one\", NATO reporting name: AT-3 Sagger) is a manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) wire-guided anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system developed in the Soviet Union. It was the first man-portable anti-tank guided missile of the Soviet Union and is probably the most widely produced ATGM of all time—with Soviet production peaking at 25,000 missiles a year during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, copies of the missile have been manufactured under various names by at least five countries.\n\nSince supplemented by more advanced anti-tank guided missiles, the Sagger and its variants have seen widespread use in nearly every regional conflict since the 1960s.\n\nDevelopment began in July 1961 with the government assigning the project to two design teams: Tula and Kolomna. The requirements were:\n\nThe designs were based on the Western ATGMs of the 1950s, such as the French ENTAC and the Swiss Cobra. In the end, the prototype developed by the Kolomna Machine Design Bureau, who were also responsible for the AT-1 Snapper, was chosen. Initial tests were completed by 20 December 1962, and the missile was accepted for service on 16 September 1963.\n\nThe missile can be fired from a portable suitcase launcher (9P111), ground vehicles (BMP-1, BRDM-2) and helicopters (Mi-2, Mi-8, Mi-24, Soko Gazelle). The missile takes about five minutes to deploy from its 9P111 fibreglass suitcase, which also serves as the launching platform.\n\nThe missile is guided to the target by means of a small joystick (9S415), which requires intensive training of the operator. The operator's adjustments are transmitted to the missile via a thin three-strand wire that trails behind the missile. The missile climbs into the air immediately after launch, which prevents it from hitting obstacles or the ground. In flight, the missile spins at 8.5 revolutions per second—it is initially spun by its booster, and the spin is maintained by the slight angle of the wings. The missile uses a small gyroscope to orient itself relative to the ground; as a result, the missile can take some time to bring back in line with the target, which gives it a minimum range of between 500 and 800 m. For targets under 1,000 m, the operator can guide the missile by eye; for targets beyond this range the operator uses the 8x power, 22.5-degree field of view 9Sh16 periscope sight.\n\nThe engagement envelope is a 3 km, 45-degree arc centered on the missile's launch axis. At ranges under 1.5 km, this arc reduces until, at the 500 m range, the missile can only hit targets 50 m either side of the center line. Accuracy falls off away from the launch axis—falling to approximately half its optimal accuracy at the extremes.\n\nWhile early estimates of the missile hitting the target ranged from 60 to 90%, experience has shown that it can drop to an efficiency between 2 and 25% in case of less than optimal conditions and lack of skill from the operator. In fact, MCLOS requires considerable skill on the part of the operator, nevertheless, the weapon has always been quite popular with its operators and has enjoyed a constant updating effort both in the Soviet Union/Russia and in other countries.\n\nThe two most serious defects of the original weapon system are its minimum range of between 500 and 800 m (targets that are closer cannot be effectively engaged) and the amount of time it takes the slow moving missile to reach maximum range—around 30 seconds—giving the intended target time to take appropriate action, either by retreating behind an obstacle, laying down a smoke-screen, or by returning fire on the operator.\n\nLater versions of the missile addressed these problems by implementing the much easier to use guidance system (though only available for ground vehicle and helicopter mounts), as well as upgrading the propulsion system to increase the average flight speed. The latest updates sport tandem warheads or probes in order to counteract explosive reactive armor, as well as thermal imaging systems. Even in these latest version, the Malyutka is probably the most inexpensive ATGM in service, with unitary price caps in the order of hundreds of dollars instead of the tens of thousands of the latest third generation models.\n\nIn Soviet service, the man-portable version was deployed as part of the anti-tank platoon of motor rifle battalions. Each platoon had two \"Malyutka\" sections, each with two teams. Each team had two launcher stations. One assistant gunner in each team served as an RPG-7 gunner. The RPG-7 was needed to cover the 500 meter deadzone created by the minimum range of the missile.\n\nIt is also an integrated part of the BMP-1, BMD-1, and BRDM-2 vehicles.\n\nOn 23 April 1972, the recently organized Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 20th Tank Regiment was attacked by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) employing the 9M14M Malyutka anti-tank guided missile for the first time. The 20th was the only South Vietnamese armor unit equipped with the M48 Patton tank. This first employment of the Malyutka destroyed one M48A3 and one M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV), and a second ACAV was damaged.\n\nDuring this engagement with the weapon, the ARVN tankers appeared fascinated by the missile's slow and erratic flight, but through experience, they soon deployed counter measures against the weapon system. Upon launching by the enemy, ARVN crewmen would fire all their weapons towards the Sagger's firing position, which would make the gunner flinch and lose control of his missile. Although the gunner could take cover away from the launch site, the joystick control wire only allowed 15 meters of clearance. During the engagement, the ARVN eventually lost eight tanks to the 9M14M missile, but had developed tactics to defend themselves against it.\n\nDuring the Battle of Cửa Việt, the PAVN put up fierce resistance to the attack, destroying 26 M-48s and M-113s with AT-3 missiles.\n\nThe missile was employed by Arab armies during the initial phases of the Yom Kippur War. Later in the war, the Israelis adopted new tactics and learned to neutralize the Sagger threat by employing large concentrations of artillery fire to either distract or kill the Sagger operators. Other improvised methods used by the Israelis to defeat the Saggers involved firing in front of the tank to create dust, moving back and forth and firing at the source of Sagger fire. These Israeli tactics were later adopted by NATO forces to counter the threat posed by Warsaw Pact ATGMs. In total, Saggers knocked out more than 800 Israeli tanks and other combat vehicles during the war.\n\nSome experts and Israeli eyewitnesses have debated the effect of the Sagger during the Yom Kippur War. Several photos of Israeli tanks draped with guidance wires from Saggers while still operating successfully exist. In addition numerous veterans of the war describe being shot at by up to eight Sagger gunners at once without a single hit on their tanks. Veteran Israeli tankers reported that the RPG 7 was a much more destructive and feared weapon in the conflict than the Sagger, largely due to its single man portability and its greater accuracy within in its effective envelope compared to that of the Sagger.\n\nRebels of the Free Libyan Army have been filmed using Saggers during the Libyan Civil War.\n\nSyrian rebels have also uploaded videos of their Sagger firings against government forces since late 2012.\n\n\nThe Malyutka and modern derivatives are still produced in several versions in following countries:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has an extensive and richly decorated interior, and serves as the cathedral for the bishopric of 's-Hertogenbosch.\n\nThe cathedral has a total length of and a width of . Its tower reaches high; the largest catholic church in the Netherlands.\n\nSt. John's Cathedral is a so-called ‘Kanjermonument’ (whopper-monument, loosely translated) and being such, it receives financial support from the Dutch government.\n\nIn 1985, it received the honorary title of Basilica Minor from Pope John Paul II.\n\nOriginally, the cathedral was built as a parish church and was dedicated to St. John Evangelist. In 1366 it became a collegiate church, and in 1559 it became the cathedral of the new diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch.\nA Romanesque church used to stand on the spot where the St. John now resides. Its construction is thought to have started in 1220 and was finished in 1340. Around 1340, building began to extend the church, from which its current gothic style came. The transept and choir were finished in 1450. In 1505, the romanesque church was largely demolished, leaving only its tower. Construction of the gothic St. John was finished about the year 1525. After 1629, when the city was conquered by the Protestants and Catholicism was banned, a Protestant minority used the church, which came to be in a heavily dilapidated state, partly due a lack of funds to maintain the building. When Napoleon visited the town in 1810, he restored the building to the Catholics.\n\nThe French Revolutionary army conquered ’s-Hertogenbosch in 1794 and the city was to the French Empire under Napoleon in 1810. Shortly afterwards, in 1813, the Prussians defeated the French and made ’s-Hertogenbosch a part of the Batavian Republic. This had as a consequence that the Dutch Reformed Church was no longer the privileged state religion. Napoleon had already promised to give the Cathedral back to the catholic majority in 1810 but it was finally arranged when King William I ordered a royal decree that the Cathedral was to be in Catholic hands indefinitely. Since 1646 the Catholic religion was repressed and the diocese of ’s-Hertogenbosch was a mission, with priests secretly performing their ministries. Napoleon had tried to create another diocese under the governance of Monsigner Van Camp and dividing the Netherlands into two large dioceses, Amsterdam and ’s-Hertogenbosch. \n\nIn 1840 the Cathedral became the church of the Parish again. In 1853 The Episcopal hierarchy was restored by Pope Pius IX, who restored the hierarchy in the Netherlands as a whole. Because of the new constitution of 1848 there was more religious liberty. The diocese of ’s-Hertogenbosch was made suffragan to the Archdiocese of Utrecht and the Cathedral became the episcopal seat of the Bishopric of ’s-Hertogenbosch. Ordained as the first bishop of ’s-Hertogenbosch was Msgr. Johannes Zwijsen who endeavoured to bring back the Miraculous statue of Our Lady of ’s-Hertogenbosch. The statue was brought to Brussels during the reformation but was carried back to ’s-Hertogenbosch in a procession on the 29th of December 1853.\n\nIn the year 1584, a fire broke out in the high wooden crossing tower, more majestic than the current one. Soon the whole tower was set ablaze, and it collapsed upon the cathedral itself, taking with it much of the roof up to point where the organ was situated. In 1830, another fire damaged the western tower, which was repaired by 1842.\n\nUnderneath the clock tower there is a carillon. The clockwork can be found at the top of the Romanesque tower.\n\nThe first restoration of the cathedral lasted from 1859 to 1946. A second attempt at restoration was executed from 1961 to 1985. The third and most recent restoration started in 1998 and was completed in 2010, costing more than 48 million euro. Major parts of the building are once again covered by scaffolding erected for restoration of the outer stonework, but also, ironically, to remedy mistakes made by earlier restoration attempts.\n\nDuring the restoration 25 new angel statues were created by sculptor Ton Mooy, including one with a modern twist. The last angel in the series holds a mobile phone and wears jeans. “The phone has just one button,” the sculptor said. “It dials directly to God”. The mobile-using angel had to be first approved by the cathedral's fathers, who rejected earlier designs which included jet engines on the angel's back.\n\nThe large organ in St. John's Cathedral is one of the most important organs of the Netherlands. The organ case of this organ is one of the most monumental of the Renaissance in the Netherlands.\n\nThis organ has a long history that begins with the construction in the period 1618-1638 by Floris Hocque II, Hans Goltfuss and Germer van Hagerbeer. The rood loft and the organ case were built by Frans Simons, a carpenter who probably came from Leiden. The sculpture of the organ case was carved by Gregor Schysler from Tyrol, who, however, like Floris Hocque, was originally from Cologne.\n\nThe organ was renovated, expanded and improved in past centuries by several organ builders, according to the latest fashions. The last renovation took place in 1984 and was conducted by the Flentrop firm. The organ was restored to about the situation of 1787, as the German organ builder A.G.F. Heyneman left it. Use is made of many pipes of that era, but also of pipes from later periods. In late 2003 the organ was thoroughly cleaned.\n\n\n"}

It has a black body (approximately long) and white head. It has white primary feathers that form a crescent in flight. Males have a red spot at the back of the head. Some taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to place this species in the genus \"Picoides\".\n\nThe range of the white-headed woodpecker stretches in the mountains from British Columbia through southern California. They form nests in dead trees or snags and reproduce once per year.\n\nMost of the range is occupied by the nominate subspecies. In the southern part of the range, \"L. a. gravirostris\", which has a longer bill - especially in males - and tail, is only found on mountaintops of the San Gabriel Mountains to San Diego County. Birds on Mount Pinos are somewhat intermediate. mtDNA cytochrome \"b\" and ATP synthase subunit 6 sequence data confirms this arrangement and also suggests that the Mount Pinos birds are closer to \"L. a. gravirostris\" (Alexander & Burns, 2006). Apparently, the larger bill of the southern subspecies is an adaptation for being better able to feed on the large, spiny cones of Coulter pines (\"Pinus coulteri\").\n\n"}

It specialises in general and business aviation and is home to Oxford Aviation Academy, formerly Oxford Aviation Training, the largest air training school in Europe. It is the only ICAO-listed civilian airport in Oxfordshire. Historically dominated by pilot training, in 2008, flying activity fell to just 48,000 movements, the lowest level on record and a 70% decline in 10 years, however, growth in business aviation was the fastest of any UK airport for the years up to 2012.\n\nOxford (Kidlington) Aerodrome is an EASA Certified Airport that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the Certificate Holder (Oxford Aviation Services Limited).\n\nThe airport was originally established in 1935 by Oxford City Council to act as municipal airport, but following RAF use (as RAF Kidlington) during World War II, it became established as a centre for aviation education, charter and maintenance facilities. \n\nThe following units were here at some point:\n\nBy 1968, it had become the second busiest airfield in the UK, with 223,270 movements – just 10% fewer than Heathrow. For 5 years just after World War II (1951–1956) Kidlington was base of operations for the Oxford Gliding Club. They later moved due to an increase of powered aircraft activity. They relocated to RAF Weston-On-The-Green.\n\nIn 1981, the airport freehold was sold by the council and later owned by BBA Aviation plc. In July 2007 the airport was sold for £40m to property entrepreneurs David and Simon Reuben.\n\nA new Saturday-only summer service to Jersey, operated by Air Southwest, ran from July to September 2009. The summer service came back in 2010, operated by CityJet.\n\nIn August 2009 the airport was rebranded as \"London Oxford Airport\". The move attracted much press comment, and criticism from the Oxford Civic Society, which described the new name as misleading; the airport is from Marble Arch in central London and generally considered to be well outside the London area. However, it was argued that highlighting proximity to London would make the airport more attractive to the overseas business aviation community and now the airport hosts the fourth busiest business aviation handling facility (FBO) in the UK.\n\nIn October 2009, London Oxford Airport was approved as a UK entry point for pets, under the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS). It is one of only two UK business aviation centres to offer this service.\n\nSwiss airline Baboo's weekly Saturday service from Oxford to Geneva commenced in December 2009. The service was augmented by a link to Rome through Alitalia Airlines; passengers were thus able to travel from Oxford to Rome, via Geneva.\n\nIn January 2010 the airport announced the launch of daily flights to Edinburgh to be operated by new start-up, Varsity Express. However flights were suspended within a week, and the airline ceased operations on 8 March 2010. A spokesman for Oxford Airport later confirmed that talks were under way with other operators, with a view to re-establishing the Oxford-Edinburgh route. It was emphasised that only well-established operators would be invited to service the route.\n\nPlans for a expansion of high-strength apron and a new hangar were outlined at the end of July 2010. The intention was to create capacity for up to 40 medium to large executive jets, in order to cater for major public events such as the Olympic Games.\n\nIn January 2012, Manx2 announced the start of a scheduled service from Oxford to the Isle of Man, beginning in May 2012. By 2013, this became a short-term seasonal service focussed around the Isle of Man TT motorcycling event.\n\nFrom March 2013 to August 2013, Minoan Air flew from Oxford to both Dublin and Edinburgh.\n\nToday, 35% of the airport's activity is accounted for by Oxford Aviation Academy training student commercial pilots under a Civil Aviation Authority/European Aviation Safety Agency (CAA/EASA) licence. 10% is business aviation, both private and charter, and the remaining 55% is mainly private and recreational general aviation activity.\n\nPrincipal companies based at Oxford Airport include Oxford Aviation Academy, Airways Aviation Academy, Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters), Gama Aviation, Volare Aviation, Jet Connections, Excellence Aviation,Flairjet, AirMed, Go Fly Oxford Pilot Flight Training and Capital Air Services. London Executive Aviation based its Embraer Legacy 600 jet at Oxford Airport in 2009, and announced plans to base a Cessna Citation Mustang very light jet (VLJ) at the facility thereafter.\n\nIn April 2009, London Oxford Airport was named as one of Europe's top Fixed-Base Operators (FBOs) in Altitudes Magazine, the only UK-based FBO to be listed, and an honour shared by only eight other FBO's across Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIn December 2009, London Oxford Airport was voted the 'Best British Business Aviation Airport' at the AOA Annual Awards Ceremony in London.\n\nIn April 2019, The Oxford Helicopter started tour operations from Oxford Airport\n\nThe airport continues to consider new scheduled routes, including flights to Amsterdam, Belfast, Edinburgh, Frankfurt, Glasgow, Jersey, Munich and Paris. These markets are said to be the more viable routes for the airport. In December 2015, the UK government confirmed funding support for a proposed reinstatement of the Oxford – Edinburgh route.\n\nHowever, the primary focus today is the London region business aviation market where the airport is the sixth busiest for this sector in the UK, but hosts the fourth-busiest FBO (Fixed-Base Operation – VIP aircraft handling facility) with over 5,500 business aircraft movements a year. Within the private and business aviation sector, the airport handled over 8,000 private passengers in 2015 whilst such flights were originating from or destined for well over 50 different overseas airports including the US, Canada, African and Middle-Eastern cities.\n\nThe main runway (Code 3C) is fully grooved and . In 2007 the airport re-surfaced, strengthened and widened the main runway, taxiways and aprons, and installed new airfield ground lighting and a CAT 1 instrument landing system (ILS). In early 2012, a new state-of-the-art Thales primary and secondary radar system was installed. In 2008 a new £2.5m business aviation terminal was completed (FBO) and is operated by Oxfordjet. The airport can handle aircraft up to and including the Boeing BBJ and Airbus ACJ series. For the business aviation operator, the airport is an approximately 60-minute drive time from the West End area of central London but offers helicopter shuttles in 25 minutes to central London's Battersea Heliport which is co-owned with London Oxford Airport.\n\nOxford Airport is served by a seven-day Oxford Airport Shuttle bus service to and from Oxford railway station and Oxford bus station. Other local bus services operated by the Oxford Bus Company and Stagecoach Buses connect the airport to the town. Although Oxford Airport is located approximately from the Cherwell Valley Line, it has no direct rail service. The nearest railway stations are , and .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143862", "title": "Tim Cordes", "text": "Tim Cordes\n\nTim Cordes is a blind American physician who earned a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2005, and is the second blind person ever to be accepted to an American school of medicine. Valedictorian of University of Notre Dame with a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry, Cordes has also earned a black belt in jujutsu, and carried the Olympic Torch through Wisconsin in 2002. Since adolescence, Cordes has been assisted by a guide dog. Cordes attended Columbus High School (Iowa) in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nCordes created a program called TimMol to represent atoms in protein structures musically instead of graphically as is more common for biochemistry software. Different elements are represented by different musical instruments, and spatial coordinates x, y, and z are represented by varying the notes' left-right position, loudness, and pitch respectively.\n\n“I couldn’t function in the dark, but he 'sees,'\" says Dr. Nancy Barklage, who recalls entering a room prior to a UW Health staff meeting, turning on the lights and finding Cordes quietly working on his laptop while waiting for others to arrive. “I’ve experienced this a number of times now and it still kind of puts you into his reality.”\n\nAs an infant, he was diagnosed with Leber's disease, a rare degenerative condition of the retina that gradually steals one's sight. Cordes still remembers one of the first times he heard someone trying to explain how his impending blindness would affect his life. “Your son can be president of the United States, but he’s never going to fly a plane or drive a car,” an ophthalmologist explained to his parents when Cordes was about 7.\n\n“And as a young boy who liked planes and cars, that was one of my first indications that things wouldn’t necessarily go smoothly,” says Cordes. “That made me sad.”\n\nHe never did fly a plane or drive a car. In fact, when most of his friends in Cedar Falls, Iowa, were learning to drive, a 16-year-old Cordes got his first guide dog, a German shepherd named Electra.\n\nBut Cordes didn't shrink from life. He's now a 34-year-old trailblazing physician who is wrapping up the third year of a four-year residency program with UW-Madison's department of psychiatry.\n\n“He has overcome challenges that most of us have just never been faced with,” says Barklage, an associate professor of psychiatry who has supervised Cordes’ work at UW Health's Psychiatric Institute and Clinic the past three years.\n\nCordes has been reticent to share his story, not wanting to become a poster boy for overcoming visual disabilities. But he's slowly becoming more at ease telling his inspirational tale. Earlier this spring, the husband and father of two young boys wowed 450 members of the Madison Civics Club with a speech at Monona Terrace titled, “How I See Possibilities.” In July, he'll give a similar talk in Dallas at the National Federation of the Blind's annual convention. And he contributed a chapter for a book to be published later this summer by the Association of American Medical Colleges that is designed to guide medical schools in accommodating students with disabilities. Cordes’ chapter deals with the use of service animals.\n\n“Thirteen years ago, I was knocking on a lot of closed doors,” Cordes says of his struggles to have medical schools seriously consider him as a candidate for admittance. “So the fact a book is coming out describing the issues people with disabilities face and ways to accommodate them, I think is tremendous progress.”\n\nCordes was valedictorian of his class at the University of Notre Dame in 1998, posting a 3.99 GPA while earning an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and conducting research on antibiotics. He then was accepted into the UW School of Medicine and Public Health's medical scientist training program, completing the notoriously challenging sequence that requires a student to finish both medical school and a Ph.D.-level research program.\n\nOver the years, Cordes also earned black belts in jujitsu and tae kwon do, carried the Olympic torch during its cross-country journey to the Salt Lake City Games in 2002, and developed computer software that uses a number of musical instruments, varying tones and left-right speakers to allow those with vision problems to conceptualize and study protein structures.\n\nDespite these made-for-the-big-screen qualities to his life, Cordes remains leery of being put on a pedestal: “I look forward to a world where people with disabilities do what they can and what they want, and it’s not exciting or it’s not different.”\n\nDr. Brad Schwartz still remembers the paperwork Cordes forwarded to the UW Medical School when applying to the medical scientist training program.\n\nWhile most attempting to head down this path are high achievers, Schwartz says Cordes stood out from the pack due to his Medical College Admission Test scores, 3.99 GPA in a demanding major and his interesting research on antibiotics. It was a reference letter from a Notre Dame researcher, however, that floored Schwartz, who was director of the program in the spring of 1998.\n\n“It’s just this incredible, glowing letter,” says Schwartz, now the dean of the University of Illinois-Urbana's College of Medicine. “And then you get to the last line, and it says, ‘This is all the more remarkable because Tim is blind.’ We’re all thinking, 'Oh my God!'\"\n\nSchwartz says his admissions review committee agreed Cordes was a \"one-in-a-million\" candidate and assumed \"every program in the country would be fighting to get him because he was so remarkable.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the case. In fact, Cordes applied to eight schools, but no one else showed interest. During one med school exit interview, doctors and researchers at a rival Big Ten Conference institution made it clear to Cordes, who has only a limited amount of light perception, that there was no way a blind student could complete the school's required coursework and rotations to earn a medical degree.\n\nCordes doesn't appear bitter about these rejections, but his mother, Therese Cordes, acknowledges it was a difficult time for her son. “To have someone tell Tim he’s not good enough, despite all he accomplished, was very, very tough on him,” she says.\n\nEven at UW-Madison, those close to the situation say some top medical school administrators were adamantly opposed to admitting Cordes. Concerns centered on two factors: the cost to make all the necessary accommodations for a blind student; and the fear that the Association of American Medical Colleges might frown on a school admitting a student who couldn't see.\n\nIn the end, Schwartz stood his ground against the naysayers and Cordes was ultimately one of 143 students earning a slot in med school out of 2,300 who applied. Although no official records are kept and there are various scales to measure the extent of vision loss, published reports in 1998 indicated Cordes was only the second blind person ever admitted to a U.S. medical school. The first was David Hartman, a 1976 Temple grad and psychiatrist in Virginia whom Cordes considers a role model.\n\nSome members of the Medical School were guarded about Cordes’ chances of success at first, says Schwartz. “But I can tell you, each year that he went along he won over more and more people,” he says. In the years to come, Cordes would learn the lessons and complete the tasks asked of every other doctor-in-training.\n\nIn the classroom, he used books on tape and in Braille to learn the fundamentals. He also relied heavily on a computer that could read downloaded texts and e-mails at a blistering 500 words per minute — something Cordes can easily understand but would sound like gibberish to someone accustomed to normal-paced speech. The university also provided him with a machine — “It looks a little like an Easy-Bake oven,” says Cordes — that makes raised-line drawings so he could interpret images using his sense of touch.\n\nIn the lab, he helped dissect a human cadaver and used his fingers to identify the various nerves, muscles and organs. “I was the guy who reached into the chest and pulled out the lungs,” says Cordes. When it came to hospital rotations, he helped deliver babies (earning Student of the Year honors in the obstetrics and gynecology rotation), observed surgery — “I felt blood flowing through an aorta” — and intubated patients during an anesthesiology rotation.\n\nThe school also hired “visual describers” to tag along with Cordes and his seeing-eye dog to help Cordes read paper charts or act as his eyes during a physical exam. In 2004, he earned the title of medical doctor.\n\nHis Ph.D. work centered on biomolecular chemistry and the makeup of proteins, a field that relies heavily on colorful, computer-generated models of complex molecular structures. Out of necessity, Cordes wrote a computer program that replicates the 3-D images using a range of audio tones and surround-sound speakers, allowing him to “visualize” the proteins in his head. In 2007 he earned his Ph.D.\n\nAlthough Cordes isn't one to puff out his chest and say “I told you so,” he is proud of the fact he never allowed others to squash his dreams. “Choosing to ignore what other people say, when they say it can’t be done, is a powerful tool,” says Cordes.\n\nWhen Cordes started his medical school journey more than a decade ago, he had no desire to work directly with patients. Research was his passion, and the medical scientist training program is designed to develop people who can bridge the gap between basic research and clinical work.\n\n“I think it was just intellectual curiosity,” Cordes said of the research-first focus.\n\nBut while working his way through the various rotations during his third year of medical school, Cordes started to zero in on a specialty and re-think his career options. He knew he couldn't be a radiologist but thought any other area was up for grabs. A four-week psychiatry rotation at the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital stood out.\n\n“I was lucky and had a really great psychiatrist running the ward I was on,” Cordes says of Dr. Tony Braus. “Some of the patients we saw there really got better in a relatively short time, and we could see some improvements in people.”\n\nWhile he enjoyed interacting with the patients, Cordes also saw the potential to conduct groundbreaking research in the study and treatment of mental disorders. “There is just a lot we don’t know,” he says. “In other places of medicine, some of the more fundamental questions have been asked and answered, but in psychiatry we are just starting to ask them.”\n\nSo after earning his M.D. and Ph.D., Cordes in 2007 entered a four-year, psychiatry research track residency program, which allows him to spend time working with patients and conducting research. Although he notes there has been no single “ah-ha” moment, Cordes says it's becoming clear his desire to work as a clinician and teacher of future doctors is stronger than his drive to focus solely on research.\n\nCordes’ typical week currently consists of two-and-a-half days at the Veterans Hospital, where he helps supervise the medical interns in an inpatient psychiatry unit, and one full day of outpatient care at a UW Health clinic in University Research Park, where he oversees more than 100 patients. He also spends a half-day attending lectures and gets one full day for research. His research mainly consists of mining data and searching for interesting patterns using the http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/00203\">Midlife Development in the United States survey, which examines the lives of people ages 30 to 70 in such areas as physical health, psychological well-being and factors that might lead to mental illness.\n\nAt the Veterans Hospital, he also worked on a clinical trial systematically rating symptoms in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nWhile he has a proven track record as a researcher, Cordes is also earning kudos as a clinician.\n\n“In psychiatry, part of what we do is getting to know patients, establishing a rapport and trying to understand what’s going on with them so we can help them out,” says Art Walaszek, the residency training director for UW-Madison's department of psychiatry. “And Tim just has an incredible, natural ability to put people at ease and communicate and listen to them. I don’t know exactly how he does it, but he just has this awareness of what’s going on with the patient.”\n\nBody language and expressions often convey information to therapists, but Cordes is able to pick up on these cues despite his sight limitations. He says he's “gotten good at listening to people — not just what they’re saying but hearing how their body moves or what direction they’re talking in.”\n\nColleagues say they can't recall an instance in which a patient did not want to be seen by Cordes because he is blind. In fact, says Braus, Cordes’ disability seemingly allows him to more easily connect with patients.\n\n“It’s almost like Tim has more credibility with some patients,” says Braus, who today works at the VA's outpatient clinic. “Tim knows what it means to recover from something or to be able to compensate or overcome a problem. People at some level seem to relate to that.”\n\nIt's not easy keeping pace with Cordes — even if you can see.\n\nWith sprinkles just starting to fall one dreary spring morning, Cordes and Vance — his loyal guide dog for the past nine years — walk briskly from the bus stop to his office.\n\nThe ride from near his home on Madison's East Side to UW Health's Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, which is across town in University Research Park, takes about 40 minutes — not bad considering Cordes has to transfer buses on the UW-Madison campus. The jaunt from the final stop to the clinic takes about five minutes at a quick pace. Somehow, Cordes narrowly misses several potholes on the driveway leading to his office. Those who have watched Cordes for years insist he has some sort of internal radar.\n\n“He has this like, Zen, where he can walk through the living room and not step on all my son’s trains,” says his wife, Blue-leaf, a native of India and a 1994 Madison East grad who met Cordes while interviewing for the M.D.-Ph.D. program, which she also completed. “I don’t know how he does it without falling and hurting himself.”\n\nBefore long, Cordes is heading up a set of stairs leading to a back entrance of the clinic. He scans his security badge to gain entry to the facility; it's just past 7 a.m.\n\nUsing his sharp memory and displaying complete trust in Vance, Cordes quickly moves down a hall to his office, drops off his jacket and backpack, and heads back down a hallway to separate locked rooms that house medical records and the mail. He intuitively slides his hand over the keypad security system, and quickly taps out the code. Inside, Braille labels allow him to promptly grab the correct patient records and mail.\n\nBack in his office, he sets the papers neatly on his desk before flipping open his laptop and scanning through e-mails using screen-reading software that ticks off the messages in quick order. Like clockwork, Jeanne Harris, one of Cordes’ visual describers, arrives in the office at 7:10 a.m. to read over any faxed-in requests for prescription refills or hand-written notes, charts or surveys Cordes can't read himself. (For many printed materials, he can take a picture of a document with his smart phone, and a program will read it to him.)\n\nTen minutes later, the paperwork is cleared, Vance is resting on the floor in the office, and Cordes is preparing for a day of numbers-crunching research on his computer.\n\nIt's easy to be impressed by how efficiently Cordes operates, but he wishes others would view it as ordinary. “Just like you, I have a job to do and I figured out how to do it,” he explains. “To me, it’s gratifying how profoundly routine this all seems at times.”\n\nEven those closest to Cordes — the ones who have never doubted his potential — confess it's difficult to view this all as merely routine.\n\nTherese Cordes still has vivid memories from three decades ago when she put a 2-year-old Tim in the car and drove him to meet with the University of Iowa's highly regarded pediatric ophthalmologists. The experts there gave her little hope, rattling off a list of things her only son would never be able to do.\n\n“I cried all the way home,” says Therese, “and then decided to forget everything they told me.”\n\nTim Cordes credits his mother for being a rock of emotional support over the years, while his father, an engineer, was pragmatically supportive — the problem-solver and the one who helped Tim get up to speed with many of the technological gizmos he relies on.\n\nIt also didn't hurt that Cordes was being pushed by two older, successful sisters, both of whom were valedictorians of their high school class (Tim finished as runner-up during his senior year) before also moving on to Notre Dame.\n\nEarlier this spring, Therese Cordes was in tears again after her son got a standing ovation following his riveting speech to the Madison Civics Club. “He’s inspirational,” said his mother.\n\nWhat, exactly, the future holds for Cordes isn't clear. After he completes the four-year residency program in July 2011, he's considering additional training so he can help people with drug addiction problems.

He entered military service in 1940 after two years of high school in Quincy, Massachusetts. In 1948 he obtained his high school equivalency certificate, and later completed 62 semester hours of study at McKendree College, Lebanon, Illinois. His military schooling included courses in communication mechanics and personnel management. He is a graduate of the Air Defense Command Noncommissioned Officer Academy. The academy was renamed the Paul W. Airey NCO Academy on December 13, 2006, in his honor.\n\nAirey enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in November 1942. During World War II, he was an aerial gunner and radio operator on B-24 Liberator bombers and is credited with 28 combat missions over Europe. In July 1944, on his 28th combat mission, a bombing run over Vienna, Austria, Airey was forced to bail out of his flak-damaged aircraft over Hungary. He was captured by the German military and was taken to Stalag Luft IV, a prisoner of war (POW) camp near the Baltic Sea for Allied airmen. In February 1945, Airey and 6,000 fellow POWs were forced to march 400 miles to another camp near Berlin as the Soviet Red Army got closer. He was liberated in May 1945 by British forces. By that time, Airey had dysentery and weighed less than 100 pounds.\n\nAirey reenlisted in the Air Force after completing a recuperation leave. He went to Naha Air Base, Okinawa, where he was responsible for radio repair. During the Korean War he was awarded the Legion of Merit, unusual for an enlisted person, for saving more than a million dollars in electronic equipment that would have deteriorated without the corrosion control assembly line he developed.\n\nAirey spent 14 of his 30-year career as a first sergeant. This included assignment to the Air Defense Command's 4756th Civil Engineering Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. On April 3, 1967 he was appointed the first Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, the service's ultimate noncommissioned officer position, having been selected from among 21 major command nominees. In this role he was adviser to Secretary of the Air Force Richard Campbell and Air Force Chief of Staff, General John P. McConnell.\n\nAirey retired from the Air Force on August 1, 1970.

Former British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose father Ian Cameron had been the club's chairman, was a member for fifteen years but resigned in 2008, over the club's declining to admit women.\n\nWhite's continues to maintain its standards as an establishment exclusively for gentlemen; brief exceptions were made for the visits by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991 and 2016. White's is a member of the Association of London Clubs.\nIn January 2018, calling themselves 'Women in Whites', a group of female protesters infiltrated the club to highlight its single-sex policy, one managing to gain entry by pretending to be a man. These persons were removed.\n\nThe club was originally established at 4 Chesterfield Street, off Curzon Street in Mayfair, in 1693 by an Italian immigrant named Francesco Bianco as a hot chocolate emporium under the name \"Mrs. White's Chocolate House\". Tickets were sold to the productions at King's Theatre and Royal Drury Lane Theatre as a side-business. White's quickly made the transition from teashop to exclusive club and in the early 18th century, it was notorious as a gambling house; those who frequented it were known as \"the gamesters of White's.\" The club gained a reputation for both its exclusivity and the often raffish behaviour of its members. Jonathan Swift referred to White's as the \"bane of half the English nobility.\"\n\nIn 1778 it moved to 37–38 St James's Street. From 1783 it was the unofficial headquarters of the Tory party, while the Whigs' club Brooks's was just down the road. A few apolitical and affable gentlemen managed to belong to both. The new architecture featured a bow window on the ground floor. In the later 18th century, the table directly in front of it became a seat of distinction, the throne of the most socially influential men in the club. This belonged to the \"arbiter elegantiarum\", Beau Brummell, until he removed to the Continent in 1816, when Lord Alvanley took the place of honour. While there, he is supposed to have once bet £3,000 on which of two raindrops would reach the bottom of a pane in the bow window. Later, the spot was reserved for the use of the 1st Duke of Wellington until his death in 1852.\n\nAlvanley's was not the most eccentric bet in White's famous betting book. Some of those entries were on sports, but more often on political developments, especially during the chaotic years of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. A good many were social bets, such as whether a friend would marry this year, or whom.\n\nThe club continues to maintain its tradition as a club for gentlemen members only, although one of its best known chefs from the early 1900s was Rosa Lewis, a model for the central character in the BBC television series \"The Duchess of Duke Street\".\n\nThere were two American members in the interwar period, one of whom was a General in the U.S. Army. Postwar American members included diplomat Edward Streator.\n\nPrince Charles held his stag night at the club before his wedding to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981. His eldest son, Prince William, was entered as a member of the club shortly after his birth.\n\nThe clubhouse is located at 37–38 St James's Street in the City of Westminster and is a Grade I listed building. Originally built in 1674 and then rebuilt in 1787–88, probably by James Wyatt, it was further altered in 1811 and the frontage was remodelled by Lockyer in 1852. Constructed of Portland stone with a slate roof it possesses the Victorian version of a Palladian façade with some French motifs. The building consists of five storeys; three principal floors of facilities for members, together with a basement and a dormered attic. In the late 1970s, the exterior was painted azure with white trim.\n\nThe Club bar is more compact than those of many other clubs. An amusing description of it, and of the rationale behind its size, may be found in chapter ten of the spy novel \"The Sixth Column\" (1951) by Peter Fleming (brother of Ian Fleming), in which the Club is thinly disguised as \"Black's\".\n\nWhilst the club does not have members' accommodation, facilities include a members' dining room, a billiards room, and several rooms (including the library and the cards room) where members may socialise, or hold private dinners. The club menu revolves around British game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143870", "title": "Swiss nationality law", "text": "Swiss nationality law\n\nSwiss citizenship is the status of being a citizen of Switzerland and it can be obtained by birth or naturalisation.\n\nThe Swiss Citizenship Law is based on the following principles:\n\nSwiss nationals are citizens of their municipality of origin, their canton of origin, and the Confederation, in that order: a Swiss citizen is defined as someone who has the bourgeoisie of a Swiss municipality (article 37 of the Swiss Federal Constitution). They are entered in the family register of their place of origin. The manner by which a Swiss citizen acquires their place of origin differs depending on whether they acquired Swiss citizenship by filiation (jus sanguinis), ordinary naturalisation, or facilitated naturalisation. Marriage has in and of itself no effect on the places of origin of the spouses.\n\nA child is Swiss at birth if:\nA child of a Swiss father not married to the mother is considered Swiss by birth when a link of paternity is declared; any children of that child also acquire Swiss citizenship by filiation.\nThe child of two Swiss citizens who are married at the time of the child's birth acquires the places of origin of the parent whose surname the child acquires.\n\nA foundling acquires Swiss citizenship and the citizenship of the canton in which they are found. The canton decides which place of origin the child receives. Once paternity is determined, the child loses Swiss citizenship, unless this would leave him or her stateless.\n\nA child adopted by a Swiss parent acquires the place of origin of the Swiss parent, thereby acquiring Swiss nationality.\n\nOrdinary naturalisation in Switzerland is a cantonal competency but regulated by federal legislation. \nOn 20 June 2014, the two Chambers of the Swiss Parliament passed the Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality (\"Révision totale de la loi sur l'acquisition et la perte de la nationalité suisse\"). The Law, first introduced in 2011 by the Swiss federal government, aimed to lower, among other requirements, the residency requirement from 12 years to 8 years. During the parliamentary debates and the ensuing disagreements between the more conservative National Council (lower house) and the more liberal Council of States (upper house), the residency requirement was increased to 10 years. The time spent in Switzerland between the ages of 8 and 18 is doubled when counted for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must have spent at least 6 years in Switzerland. The law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'établissement), which is commonly referred as a C permit. Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with temporary admission (\"Permis d'admission provisoire\") is halved counting the years spent in Switzerland for the purposes of naturalisation. The 2014 Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality entered into force on 1 January 2018.\nApplications for naturalisation submitted prior to the entry into force of the new nationality law will continue to be processed under the 1952 law.\nThe federal nationality law of 2014 imposes two formal conditions which an applicant for naturalisation must satisfy:\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned formal conditions, the federal nationality law of 2014 also imposes material conditions which an applicant for naturalisation must meet:\n\nCantons can impose further requirements which are complementary to the federal requirements.\n\nForeigners in the following categories may apply for simplified naturalisation:\n\n\nA person married to a Swiss citizen may apply for Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation after living in Switzerland for five years and having been married for at least three years. No language test is required, but one must show the following:\n\n\nChildren from the person's previous relationships (but not same-sex couples) are given citizenship along with the partner.\n\nIt is also possible for the spouse of a Swiss citizen to apply for facilitated naturalisation while residing overseas after the following:\n\n\nSpouses acquiring Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation will acquire the citizenship of the place and canton of origin of their Swiss spouse.\n\nThe federal constitution declares that the Confederation will facilitate the naturalisation of third generation immigrants (Art. 38 §3 part a). Legislation has yet to be introduced describing the precise requirements for an application for facilitated naturalisation under article 38 §3 part a.\n\nThe Canton of Vaud legislated in 2004 to allow for second-generation foreigners to acquire Swiss nationality more easily under the following conditions:\n\nThe 2004 law also facilitates the naturalisation of foreigners of the 3rd generation under the following conditions:\n\nThe yearly rate of naturalisation has quintupled over the 1990s and 2000s, from roughly 9,000 to 45,000 naturalisations per year.\n\nRelative to the population of resident foreigners, this amounts to an increase from 8% in 1990 to 27% in 2007, or relative to the number of Swiss citizens from 0.16% in 1990 to 0.73% in 2007.\n\nForeigners in the following category can apply to have their nationality restored:\n\nFormal conditions:\n\nA child whose Swiss citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut.\n\nA Swiss child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Swiss citizenship; if the adoption is subsequently annulled, the loss of nationality is retroactively invalidated.\n\nA Swiss citizen born abroad to at least one Swiss parent and holding at least one other nationality loses Swiss citizenship at age 22 if:\n\n\nEqually, the child of a person who loses Swiss nationality in this manner also loses Swiss nationality.\nExceptionally, a person who has been prevented, against their will, from taking the necessary actions to retain Swiss citizenship may undertake the required actions within a delay of 1 year following the cessation of such hindrances.\n\nEach municipality in Switzerland maintains its own registry of citizens, which is separate from the registry of people living in the municipality. Many Swiss citizens do not live in their place of origin; therefore, they are often required by the municipality in which they live to get a certificate of citizenship (\"acte d'origine/Heimatschein/atto d'origine\") from their place of origin. The constitution forbids discrimination based on one's place of origin, with the exception of bourgeoisies.\nAccording to the Federal Office for Migration, there has been no restriction on multiple citizenship in Switzerland since 1 January 1992. Thus, foreigners who acquire Swiss citizenship and Swiss citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country). An estimated 60% of Swiss nationals living abroad in 1998 were multiple citizens.\n\nSince many nationality laws now allow both parents to transmit their nationality to their common child (and not only the father, as used to be often the case), many children automatically acquire multiple citizenship at birth. This is especially prevalent in Switzerland, since a relatively high proportion of the population holds a foreign passport (up to 54% in Geneva and 20% nationally). However, the Federal Office for Migration specially notes that this has not resulted in any significant practical problems. Military service, the most likely problem to arise, is usually done in the country where the applicant resides at the time of conscription.\n\nEven though Swiss nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Swiss national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce a citizenship, if that foreign country's nationality law forbids such multiple citizenship.\n\nSwiss citizenship laws have been widely debated over recent years. In comparison to other nationality laws, access to Swiss citizenship is relatively narrow and restricted, and several modifications to widen access to Swiss citizenship via constitutional initiatives and referendums have been proposed. The referendums on the matter – held in 1983, 1994, and 2004 – were all rejected by Swiss voters. In particular, during the referendum held in September 2004, Swiss voters rejected proposals to give some long-resident Swiss-born persons aged between 14 and 24 the right to apply for \"facilitated\" naturalisation (which bypasses cantonal and municipal requirements) and grant automatic Swiss citizenship to persons born in Switzerland with a parent also born in Switzerland.\n\nWhile minimal requirements for obtaining Swiss citizenship by naturalisation are set at the federal level, Swiss cantons and municipalities are free to introduce more stringent requirements. Some municipalities had previously had no procedure for allowing naturalisations, effectively rendering it impossible, such as in La Chaux in the Canton of Vaud. In 1999, the municipality of Emmen and the canton of Lucerne began using referendums to decide the outcome of naturalisation requests. The practice was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in July 2003. A referendum directed at legalizing this practice was rejected on 1 June 2008.\n\nSwiss citizens are entitled to\n\nMale Swiss citizens, including dual citizens, can be required to perform military service or civilian service (women can do it voluntarily). Male citizens who do not complete their military service or who do not do civilian service must pay a supplementary tax. Swiss citizens are not allowed to work for a foreign (non-Swiss) military, unless they are a citizen of – and are resident in – the country in question. The Swiss Guards of the Vatican State are regarded as police, not as an army.\n\nVisa requirements for Swiss citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Switzerland. In May 2018, Swiss citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Swiss passport 5th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.\n\nThe Swiss nationality is ranked ninth, together with Ireland, in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.\n\n\n"}

It was published in 2001 and is subtitled \"\"A Wildly Distorted Account\"\".\n\nSuperficially a piece of travel writing, \"30 Days in Sydney\" is perhaps more of a view into the psyche of Carey, an Australian returning home after a seventeen-year absence, his motley crew of friends, and Sydneysiders in general.\n\nThe book takes the form of an impressionistic, possibly somewhat fictionalised, account of Carey's brief stay, and of his attempts to gather his required material. During his time in Sydney, around the 2000 Olympic Games, he badgered his friends with a battered tape recorder, in order to get them to give their own stories and impressions of the city. Carey wishes to structure the book around the elements of earth, wind, fire and water, and his friends, sometimes reluctantly, oblige. One tells of his attempts to rescue his home from a bushfire, and another of a near death experience during the disastrous 1998 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.\n\nMeanwhile, Carey's own narrative digresses into history and anecdote, touching on Sydney's uneasy race relations and a horrific recurring dream involving the Harbour Bridge, and culminating in a dramatic late night incident in a rooftop squat.\n\nCarey finishes the book by stating \"\"A metropolis is, by definition, inexhaustible, and by the time I departed, thirty days later, Sydney was as unknowable to me as it had been on that clear April morning when I arrived.\"\"\n"}
{"id": "2143873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143873", "title": "Ancoats", "text": "Ancoats\n\nAncoats is an area of Manchester in North West England, next to the Northern Quarter, the northern part of Manchester city centre.\n\nHistorically in Lancashire, Ancoats became a cradle of the Industrial Revolution and has been called \"the world's first industrial suburb\". For many years, from the late 18th century onwards, Ancoats was a thriving industrial district. The area suffered accelerating economic decline from the 1930s and depopulation in the years after the Second World War, particularly during the slum clearances of the 1960s.\n\nSince the 1990s Ancoats' industrial heritage has been recognised and its proximity to the city centre has led to investment and substantial regeneration. The southern part of the area is branded as New Islington, by UK property developers Urban Splash, while the north retains the Ancoats name, with redevelopment centred on the Daily Express Building.\n\nFor the purpose of local government elections the area is part of the Ancoats and Beswick ward of the city of Manchester.\n\nThe name Ancoats is likely to have derived from the Old English \"ana cots\", meaning \"lonely cottages\". The settlement is first recorded as \"Elnecot\" in 1212. In a survey of 1320, Ancoats was recorded as one of the eight hamlets within the township of Manchester in the ancient parish of Manchester within the hundred of Salford; the hamlet probably consisted of a few cottages and farmhouses centred on what is now Ancoats Lane, Butler Lane and Newton Lane. During the medieval period, Ancoats Hall was built. Land in Ancoats was bequeathed in the 14th century by Henry de Ancotes. The village covered the area of land that roughly lies between the River Medlock and the River Irk.\n\n Survey work for the Rochdale Canal was carried out by James Brindley in 1765. The knowledge that its construction would make the transport of raw materials and finished goods more convenient gave industrialists the confidence to build their cotton mills. The first mills were built in Ancoats as early as 1790. In 1792 commissioners were established for the improvement of the township of Manchester, which included Ancoats. Towards the end of the 18th century steam power was first used to power the cotton mills. Some of the earliest mills of this period were Murray's Mills, which were established next to the Rochdale Canal on Union Street (now Redhill Street) off Great Ancoats Street, by Adam and George Murray in 1798. Later, they became known as Ancoats Mills when they were operated by McConnel & Company Ltd. The streets of Ancoats were also laid out during the latter part of the 18th century, with little development taking place other than small houses and shops along Great Ancoats Street and Oldham Road (A62 road).\n\nFrom the opening of the Rochdale Canal in 1804 the development of mills continued on a much larger scale. Mills in Ancoats included Victoria Mills, Wellington Mill, Brunswick Mill, India Mills, Dolton Mills, Lonsdale Mills, Phoenix Mill, Lloydsfield Mill, Sedgewick Mill, Decker Mill (owned by the Murray brothers), New Mill, Beehive Mill, Little Mill, Paragon Mill, Royal Mill and Pin Mill.\n\nAncoats grew rapidly to become an important industrial centre and as a result it also became a densely populated area. By 1815 Ancoats was the most populous district in Manchester. Streets of back-to-back houses and court dwellings were rapidly built. For the poorest members of the community, houses were split and cellars let separately. Public health was a concern; a survey motivated by the fear of a cholera outbreak showed that over half of homes in Ancoats had no private plumbing, and over half of streets were not cleaned.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century Ancoats was densely developed. In 1851 Ancoats' total population was 53,737, larger than towns such as Bury and Blackburn. However, despite this large population, Ancoats lacked public buildings and spaces. There were no parks and the only public buildings were a few churches and a dispensary. As late as 1821 there had been no churches.\n\nCotton was not the only industry in the locality, as foundries and engineering factories were required to produce the machinery needed by the mills. The largest of these were those operated by the brothers John Muir Hetherington and Thomas Ridley Hetherington, which were established in 1830. Eventually the company became known as John Hetherington and Sons Ltd and the principal factory was at Vulcan Works on Pollard Street. The company was also the proprietor of Curtis, Sons & Company, which was established in 1804 at the Phoenix Works, which were on both sides of Chapel Street (now Chapeltown Street). On one side of the street there was a brass and iron works and on the other side there was a machinery factory. Hetherington's produced a huge range of machinery for the textile industry that included machinery for opening, preparing, spinning and doubling cotton, cotton waste, wool and worsted. Their speciality was a machine called a Combined Opener and Scutcher that was very effective in the cleaning of most types of cotton without damaging the staple or losing serviceable fibre.\n\nPossibly the least known, but vitally important, industry in Ancoats was the manufacture of flint glass. More than 25 glassworks have been identified in Manchester, all built during the 19th century, and many of these were in Ancoats. Thomas Percival and William Yates established one of these on Union Street (now Redhill Street) in 1844. The works was equipped with two furnaces (later three), an annealing house, workshops, a warehouse and offices. In 1852, Thomas Vickers joined the company and William Yates left in 1862. After this, the company became known as Percival Vickers British and Foreign Flint Glass Works. It made a large range of glassware that included tumblers, wine glasses, decanters, vases, celery vases, salts and cake stands. One of the buildings in Ancoats, the Flint Glass Works, still exists today and has been converted into serviced offices.\n\nAt the top of Stony Brow (later Junction Street and now Jutland Street) there was the multi-storey drysalters factory of Thomas Hassall. It was said that this was the only drysalters in England and it supplied rock salt, moss litter and all kinds of other things. There were also chemical works (especially alum), floor-cloth works and finishing and calendering works that rolled cloth to smooth or glaze it.\n\nDuring the 19th century, due to political and economic circumstances, many Italians left Italy for a more secure life. Most of the Italians who arrived in Ancoats were from Liguria, in northwest Italy, and Frosinone and Caserta, southeast of Rome. Over the next hundred years they created what became known as Ancoats Little Italy. Large numbers of Irish also settled in Ancoats. According to the 1851 census almost half of the men living in Ancoats had been born in Ireland.\n\nThe Methodists were very active in Ancoats at the end of the 19th century – they ran both a men's workhouse and women's night shelter (with coffee tavern). There were dozens of pubs, however, of which only five buildings remain and only two of these are still open. The Salvation Army had a presence in Ancoats, with the Star Hall and Crossley Hospital in Pollard Street. Crossley Court, flats belonging to the Salvation Army Housing Association, now stands on the site. Ancoats Hospital was located on Old Mill Street, adjacent to the Ashton Canal. This has been closed to patients for some time, and is currently under residential development. Thomas Horsfall opened the Manchester Art Museum, a free art gallery, in Ancoats in 1886. His aim was to create a morally elevating alternative to pubs.\n\nGiven the historically high levels of Irish and Italian immigration, a large proportion of Ancoats' population has been Roman Catholic. Ancoats had a colony of Italians from 1835 and many of them became successful in business; e.g. the Ronchetti family were opticians, instrument makers and also waterproof manufacturers; J. L. Casartelli was an optician, instrument maker and manufacturing chemist.\n\nAircraft were manufactured in Ancoats and this factory was at Brownsfield Mill, which was on the corner of Great Ancoats Street and Binns Place at the point where the Rochdale Canal passes below Great Ancoats Street. Here, A.V. Roe (Avro) established his factory in 1910. Men from Ancoats serving in the Army in France during the First World War were aware that aeroplanes they saw in action above them had been made in Ancoats.\n\nIn 1939, the \"Daily Express\" newspaper company opened new premises, which were built in the \"functional\" style, using new curtain-wall technology identical to that on the company's Daily Express Building in Fleet Street, London and in Glasgow.\n\nThe substantial economic activity generated by such a concentration of mills was halted by the slump in the cotton industry in the 1930s. Thereafter, the prosperity of the mills declined steadily, and the only new industry to establish itself in Ancoats was newspaper printing. Ancoats, like neighbouring Miles Platting and Collyhurst, became very run down and notorious for deprivation and crime. Cotton spinning ceased in Manchester and other textile-related uses were found for the mills: clothes manufacture, machinery repairs and warehouses for imported goods' rag trade.\n\nThe 1960s witnessed further decline as, during the mass clearance of the area's terraced homes, the population was re-housed in the north and east of the city. The mills, attracting decreasing rents, fell into disrepair.\n\nDespite the clearance of Victorian terraces during the early 1960s and the relocation of most households to overspill estates like Hattersley and Gamesley, many new houses and flats were built in Ancoats by the local council. Inevitably, the local area's population was lower by 1970 than it had been a decade earlier, as the new housing developments were more spaced out, and some former residential areas had been redeveloped for commercial and industrial use.\n\nNewspaper printing, one of Ancoats' 20th century industries, fell victim to changes in technology, with the \"Daily Express\" ceasing to be published from its famous black glass building in 1989. The closure of Express Printers was also the start of Ancoats' renewal, as the impact of low investment and increasing unemployment became recognised.\n\nIn June 1989, Manchester City Council designated land bounded by Great Ancoats Street, Oldham Road, Kemp Street, Wadeford Close, Jersey Street and the Rochdale Canal into a conservation area where a number of buildings were listed. While it protected a number of historically significant buildings, it made regeneration more difficult. In 1990, the Eastside Regeneration was formed, the first organisation created to regenerate the area. The Eastside Regeneration in turn spawned the formation of the Ancoats Build Preservation Trust in 1995 and the Ancoats Urban Village Company in 1996. Unfortunately, Manchester's bids for the 1996 and 2000 Olympics caused speculative buying of property in Ancoats in the early 1990s. When the bids failed the buildings were abandoned and decay accelerated. By 1998 it was estimated that 80% of business floor space in Ancoats was vacant.\n\nIn 2000, the government accepted the £250m New Islington Project to redevelop a section of land between the Rochdale and Ashton Canals. To assist regeneration by preventing speculative purchase of land the North West Development Agency made a compulsory purchase order of land in the area. A target population of 15,000 by 2010 was set for the Ancoats area.\n\nThe following Listed buildings are in the Ancoats conservation area:\n\n\n\nAncoats has been the setting for several novels by Howard Spring, including \"Fame is the Spur\". It was also the setting for Isabella Banks' novel \"The Manchester Man\".\n\nAncoats was mentioned in the lyrics of Brian and Michael's 1978 UK number one hit, \"Matchstalk Men and Matchstalk Cats and Dogs\", a tribute to L. S. Lowry.\n\nA fictional singer, Ann Coates, is credited with backing vocals on the 1986 single \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" by the Smiths.\n\nThe British trip-hop band the Baby Namboos released a song and album titled \"Ancoats 2 Zambia\" in 1999. The single was famously remixed by drum and bass producer Dillinja.\n\n\n\n"}

When her husband, a devout Catholic, discovered them in each other's arms, he took Hendra on a trip to Quarr Abbey, a monastery on the Isle of Wight off the coast of England. Hendra, expecting to be disciplined, was surprised when a \"cartoonish\" monk, Father Joseph Warrilow, instead treated him kindly. Hendra fell in love with Quarr and decided to become a monk.\n\nWhen Hendra reached the age of eighteen and could legally begin his time at Quarr, Father Joe found out that Hendra had received a scholarship to Cambridge University, and he urged Hendra to first attend college and obtain a degree before he could be admitted to the monastery.\n\nWhile at Cambridge, Hendra attended a theatrical revue called \"Beyond the Fringe\". The brilliant performance by Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Alan Bennett, and Jonathan Miller had such an impact on him that his life set off on a totally different course. In his words, \"I went into that theater a monk. I came out a satirist. Save the world through prayer? I don't think so. I'm going to save it through laughter.\" In spite of his decision not to become a monk, he continued to visit Father Joe for more than 40 years, until Father Joe's death on April 27, 1998.\n\nUS first edition hardcover\n"}

If the technique is performed at high speed on a single string voicing the same note, it may be referred to as \"tremolo picking\" or \"double picking\".\n\nGood alternate picking involves a continuous down-up or up-down motion of the picking hand, even when not picking a note (except when the gap lasts longer than one full up-down motion). In this manner, an up-beat (such as an even-numbered eighth note or, at faster tempos, sixteenth note) will always be played with an upward picking stroke, while the down-beats are always played with downward picking strokes. This allows for fluid incorporation of legato-based notes such as hammer-ons and/or pull-offs in the middle of picked phrases.\n\nThe technique has many advantages and some disadvantages, largely depending on the licks the guitarist is attempting to play. For example, during fast passages, alternate picking is necessary in keeping the picking arm from tiring out. At very high tempos, alternate picking is essentially required, since techniques like downpicking are made not feasible.\n\nMost scalar runs are most easily played using alternate picking. Similarly, the complex, syncopated rhythm guitar patterns found in death metal require a good alternate picking technique to play fast and accurately.\n\nOn the other hand, large arpeggios (especially those spanning more than one octave) are very difficult to play using pure alternate picking and almost impossible to play at great speeds, which is why many guitarists choose to employ sweep picking to play these arpeggios (e.g. Glenn Tipton, K. K. Downing, Frank Gambale & Mario Parga). Similarly, some kinds of licks are easier when played using such specialized techniques as legato, economy picking (a hybrid of alternate and sweep picking) or tapping.\n\nDespite some of the well-known disadvantages of the technique, some guitarists (such as Al Di Meola, Steve Morse) emphasize the near-exclusive use of alternate picking, even in situations where another technique would be easier, claiming that pure alternate picking leads to a more consistent sound and allows for greater control of tone.\n\nAlternate picking can be heard in almost all styles of picked guitar music, from jazz and bluegrass, to heavy metal. \nVictor Wooten uses his thumb for alternate picking, as displayed on his DVD \"Super Bass Solo Technique\".\n\n\n"}

Quadratic variation is just one kind of variation of a process.\n\nSuppose that \"X\" is a real-valued stochastic process defined on a probability space formula_1 and with time index \"t\" ranging over the non-negative real numbers. Its quadratic variation is the process, written as [\"X\"], defined as\nwhere \"P\" ranges over partitions of the interval [0,\"t\"] and the norm of the partition \"P\" is the mesh. This limit, if it exists, is defined using convergence in probability. Note that a process may be of finite quadratic variation in the sense of the definition given here and its paths be nonetheless almost surely of infinite 1-variation for every \"t\">0 in the classical sense of taking the supremum of the sum over all partitions; this is in particular the case for Brownian Motion.\n\nMore generally, the covariation (or cross-variance) of two processes \"X\" and \"Y\" is\nThe covariation may be written in terms of the quadratic variation by the polarization identity:\n\nA process \"X\" is said to have \"finite variation\" if it has bounded variation over every finite time interval (with probability 1). Such processes are very common including, in particular, all continuously differentiable functions. The quadratic variation exists for all continuous finite variation processes, and is zero.\n\nThis statement can be generalized to non-continuous processes. Any càdlàg finite variation process \"X\" has quadratic variation equal to the sum of the squares of the jumps of \"X\". To state this more precisely, the left limit of \"X\" with respect to \"t\" is denoted by \"X\", and the jump of \"X\" at time \"t\" can be written as Δ\"X\" = \"X\" - \"X\". Then, the quadratic variation is given by\nBy the continuity of \"X\", this vanishes in the limit as formula_6 goes to zero.\n\nThe quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion \"B\" exists, and is given by [\"B\"] = \"t\", however the limit in the definition is meant in the L2 sense and not pathwise. This generalizes to Itô processes that, by definition, can be expressed in terms of Itô integrals\nwhere \"B\" is a Brownian motion. Any such process has quadratic variation given by\n\nQuadratic variations and covariations of all semimartingales can be shown to exist. They form an important part of the theory of stochastic calculus, appearing in Itô's lemma, which is the generalization of the chain rule to the Itô integral. The quadratic covariation also appears in the integration by parts formula\nwhich can be used to compute [\"X\",\"Y\"].\n\nAlternatively this can be written as a Stochastic Differential Equation:\nwhere formula_11\n\nAll càdlàg martingales, and local martingales have well defined quadratic variation, which follows from the fact that such processes are examples of semimartingales.\nIt can be shown that the quadratic variation [\"M\"] of a general locally square integrable martingale \"M\" is the unique right-continuous and increasing process starting at zero, with jumps Δ[\"M\"] = Δ\"M\", and such that \"M\" − [\"M\"] is a local martingale. A proof of existence of [\"M\"] (without using stochastic calculus) is given in Karandikar–Rao (2014). \n\nA useful result for square integrable martingales is the Itô isometry, which can be used to calculate the variance of Itô integrals,\nThis result holds whenever \"M\" is a càdlàg square integrable martingale and \"H\" is a bounded predictable process, and is often used in the construction of the Itô integral.\n\nAnother important result is the Burkholder–Davis–Gundy inequality. This gives bounds for the maximum of a martingale in terms of the quadratic variation. For a local martingale \"M\" starting at zero, with maximum denoted by \"M\" ≡ sup|\"M\"|, and any real number \"p\" ≥ 1, the inequality is\nHere, \"c\" < \"C\" are constants depending on the choice of \"p\", but not depending on the martingale \"M\" or time \"t\" used. If \"M\" is a continuous local martingale, then the Burkholder–Davis–Gundy inequality holds for any \"p\" > 0.\n\nAn alternative process, the predictable quadratic variation is sometimes used for locally square integrable martingales. This is written as <\"M\">, and is defined to be the unique right-continuous and increasing predictable process starting at zero such that \"M\" − <\"M\"> is a local martingale. Its existence follows from the Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem and, for continuous local martingales, it is the same as the quadratic variation.\n\n\n"}

After leaving WCW in 1997, he continued to wrestle in independent promotions until 2004.\n\nPrior to his professional career Pittman was a successful amateur wrestler.\n\nHe has also fought in four mixed martial arts bouts.\n\nBefore entering the marines, Pittman attended the University of Kentucky where he was on the wrestling team.\nHe grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Attended P.S. 279.\n\nPittman joined the United States Marine Corps and achieved the rank of sergeant. He was a wrestler in the Marines and won several championships. His biggest victories came in the 1989 and 1991 USA Senior Greco-Roman Championships, in which he won the heavyweight division. He also placed seventh in the heavyweight division at the 1989 FILA Greco-Roman World Championships.\n\nAfter leaving the military, Pittman trained as a professional wrestler at the WCW Power Plant under Terry Taylor and The Assassin. Pittman made his wrestling debut as Sgt. Craig Pittman, a villainous character at a live event on February 5, 1994. He won his first match by pinning Brian Anderson just before the time limit expired. He made his televised debut as one of the judges for Marquess of Queensberry Rules between Ric Flair and Lord Steven Regal on the April 30 episode of \"Worldwide\". His first televised match was on the November 5 episode of \"Pro\" by defeating Ken Kendall. His character was repackaged in early 1995 and vignettes promoting his debut aired on television beginning with the February 19 episode of \"Worldwide\". He made his televised re-debut by defeating Todd Morton on the February 26 episode of \"Worldwide\". Pittman made his pay-per-view debut at The Great American Bash, against \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, which he lost by disqualification when he refused to let go of the \"Code Red\" when Duggan was in the ropes. This marked Pittman's first loss but he remained undefeated as he was not pinned or submitted.\n\nPittman began his first feud against Cobra in the summer of 1995. According to the storyline, he had been Cobra's commanding officer during the Gulf War. During a mission, he left Cobra behind, which led to Cobra seeking revenge in WCW. This feud led to a match between the two at Fall Brawl, which Pittman won by submission after attacking him from behind before the match while a recruit of Pittman distracted Cobra. However, Pittman lost a rematch to Cobra on the September 23 episode of \"Saturday Night\", thus ending Pittman's undefeated streak in WCW. In November 1995, Pittman also appeared at WCW's first World War 3 pay-per-view. In a sixty-man battle royal, he became the forty-second wrestler eliminated when Hugh Morrus threw him over the top rope. Following the pay-per-view, Pittman began a quest to find a manager to guide his career. After propositioning the likes of Jimmy Hart, Bobby Heenan, and Steve McMichael, Pittman connected with Teddy Long, turning face in the process.\n\nIn 1996, Pittman wrestled mainly as a mid-carder, losing most of his matches to main event wrestlers. He received his first opportunity for the World Heavyweight Championship against Ric Flair on the March 23 episode of \"Saturday Night\", where Flair retained the title. He made two final pay-per-view appearances in 1996. The first came at Slamboree 1996 as part of a \"Lethal Lottery\" tournament. In a storyline in which wrestlers were supposedly assigned partners in a random drawing, Pittman teamed with Scott Steiner in a loss to Rick Steiner and The Booty Man., in fall 1996, Pittman quietly turned heel again and dropped Long as his manager, Pittman also appeared at 1996's World War 3 as part of the sixty-man battle royal, which was won by The Giant.\n\nPittman would go on to wrestle in WCW through the first 5 months of 1997, gaining opportunities at the United States Heavyweight Championship against Eddie Guerrero on \"Saturday Night\" on March 4th, and his final match in WCW taking place on the 24th of May on Saturday Night, a shot at the World Television Championship against Lord Steven Regal.\n\nPittman left WCW in mid-1997 for the National Wrestling Alliance's Mid-Atlantic area.

Until July 2004, Blackwell lived at home with his parents in Melling, Merseyside, an affluent village in the northern suburbs of Liverpool, England. It is believed that his parents were overindulgent, as well as excessively overprotective and controlling of even minor aspects of Blackwell's life throughout his childhood. He had been an under-18 tennis champion at the local club. Nicknamed \"Little Brian\" by his parents and \"Brains\" by his friends, he was described as an \"exemplary student\" with a scholarship to Liverpool College and was planning to begin studying medicine at the University of Nottingham in the autumn of 2004.\n\nHe regularly told innocuous lies, such as embellishing his academic achievements, but his lying escalated in the two months leading up to killing his parents in July 2004. He applied for 13 credit cards in his father's name and attempted to obtain a cash advance from the bank by falsely claiming to be a professional tennis player who needed the money to play in the French Open later that summer. He wrote on his application form that he'd be able to repay the loan with his fabricated salary of £45,000 a year. His girlfriend at the time believed he was a professional tennis player with a sponsorship from Nike and that he had a £60,000 Mercedes and a £450,000 flat in the same complex where footballer Steven Gerrard lived. With the savings bond that his parents had intended for university, he bought his girlfriend expensive gifts, and \"hired\" her as his manager, writing her a cheque for £39,000 that bounced. When his mother found out about the lies he told to the bank and the large withdrawals he had made, she contacted the bank manager.\n\nOn 25 July 2004, Blackwell killed his parents in their home by bludgeoning them with a claw hammer and stabbing them repeatedly with a carving knife. He told the Liverpool Crown Court at his 2005 trial that he became enraged when his parents expressed concern about his extravagant spending and tried to stop him from travelling to the US with his then-girlfriend.\n\nThe next day, Blackwell and his girlfriend, who was unaware of the violent crime Blackwell had just committed, went on a lavish holiday to the United States as originally planned. Upon returning to Liverpool in mid-August, Blackwell stayed at his girlfriend's house for the next couple of weeks under the pretence that he was locked out of his parents' house while they were on holiday in Spain.\n\nOn 5 September 2004, six weeks after they were killed, police discovered the decomposing bodies of Blackwell's parents after a neighbour called to report a strong, unusual odour coming from the property. The decomposition of the bodies from the attacks was so advanced that investigators initially thought they had died from gun shot wounds. Blackwell was arrested the following day and charged with two counts of murder. He denied the charges during initial interviews and hearings and was remanded into custody without bail until trial.\n\nDuring an interview, Blackwell claimed he knew nothing of his parents' deaths and was on holiday when they were killed. After two days of questioning, Blackwell's story began to change. He confessed to the killings and claimed that he had acted in self-defence. According to Blackwell, he was holding a claw hammer for hanging a picture on the wall when his father stood up to hit him. Investigators had previously learned that Blackwell's father had been struck on the back of the head while sitting down, which conflicted with Blackwell's claim of self-defence. Afterwards, according to Blackwell, his mother came in, and he attacked her.\n\nThe double-murder charge was dropped after he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after experts diagnosed him with narcissistic personality disorder. Blackwell was sentenced to life imprisonment on 29 June 2005. According to \"The Guardian\", Blackwell could theoretically be eligible for parole after serving just over five and half years if a psychiatrist decided he was \"fit for release\", but the judge stated that \"present evidence suggests that that conclusion is unlikely ever to be reached.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2143933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143933", "title": "Rhinorrhea", "text": "Rhinorrhea\n\nRhinorrhea or rhinorrhoea is a condition where the nasal cavity is filled with a significant amount of mucus fluid. The condition, commonly known as a runny nose, occurs relatively frequently. Rhinorrhea is a common symptom of allergies (hay fever) or certain viral infections, such as the common cold. It can be a side effect of crying, exposure to cold temperatures, cocaine abuse, or withdrawal, such as from opioids like methadone. Treatment for rhinorrhea is not usually necessary, but there are a number of medical treatments and preventive techniques available.\n\nThe term was coined in 1866 and is a combination of the Greek terms \"rhino-\" (\"of the nose\") and \"-rhoia\" (\"discharge\" or \"flow\").\n\nRhinorrhea is characterized by an excess amount of mucus produced by the mucous membranes that line the nasal cavities. The membranes create mucus faster than it can be processed, causing a backup of mucus in the nasal cavities. As the cavity fills up, it blocks off the air passageway, causing difficulty breathing through the nose. Air caught in nasal cavities, namely the sinus cavities, cannot be released and the resulting pressure may cause a headache or facial pain. If the sinus passage remains blocked, there is a chance that sinusitis may result. If the mucus backs up through the Eustachian tube, it may result in ear pain or an ear infection. Excess mucus accumulating in the throat or back of the nose may cause a post-nasal drip, resulting in a sore throat or coughing. Additional symptoms include sneezing, nosebleeds, and nasal discharge.\n\nRhinorrhea is especially common during winter months and certain low temperature seasons. Cold-induced rhinorrhea occurs due to a combination of thermodynamics and the body's natural reactions to cold weather stimuli. One of the purposes of nasal mucus is to warm inhaled air to body temperature as it enters the body. In order for this to happen, the nasal cavities must be constantly coated with liquid mucus. During cold, dry seasons, the mucus lining nasal passages tends to dry out, meaning that mucous membranes must work harder, producing more mucus to keep the cavity lined. As a result, the nasal cavity can fill up with mucus. At the same time, when air is exhaled, water vapor in breath condenses as the warm air meets the colder outside temperature near the nostrils. This causes an excess amount of water to build up inside nasal cavities. In these cases, the excess fluid usually spills out externally through the nostrils.\n\nRhinorrhea can be a symptom of other diseases, such as the common cold or influenza. During these infections, the nasal mucous membranes produce excess mucus, filling the nasal cavities. This is to prevent infection from spreading to the lungs and respiratory tract, where it could cause far worse damage. It has also been suggested that rhinorrhea is a result of viral evolution, and may be a response that is not useful to the host, but which has evolved by the virus to maximise its own infectivity. Rhinorrhea caused by these infections usually occur on circadian rhythms. Over the course of a viral infection, sinusitis (the inflammation of the nasal tissue) may occur, causing the mucous membranes to release more mucus. Acute sinusitis consists of the nasal passages swelling during a viral infection. Chronic sinusitis occurs when one or more nasal polyps appear. This can be caused by a deviated septum as well as a viral infection.\n\nRhinorrhea can also occur when individuals with allergies to certain substances, such as pollen, dust, latex, soy, shellfish, or animal dander, are exposed to these allergens. In people with sensitized immune systems, the inhalation of one of these substances triggers the production of the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE), which binds to mast cells and basophils. IgE bound to mast cells are stimulated by pollen and dust, causing the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. In turn, this causes, among other things, inflammation and swelling of the tissue of the nasal cavities as well as increased mucus production. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as chlorine and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can make the condition considerably worse.\n\nRhinorrhea is also associated with shedding tears (lacrimation), whether from emotional events or from eye irritation. When excess tears are produced, the liquid drains through the inner corner of the eyelids, through the nasolacrimal duct, and into the nasal cavities. As more tears are shed, more liquid flows into the nasal cavities, both stimulating mucus production and hydrating any dry mucus already present in the nasal cavity. The buildup of fluid is usually resolved via mucus expulsion through the nostrils.\n\nIf caused by a head injury, rhinorrhea can be a much more serious condition. A basilar skull fracture can result in a rupture of the barrier between the sinonasal cavity and the anterior cranial fossae or the middle cranial fossae. This rupture can cause the nasal cavity to fill with cerebrospinal fluid. This condition, known as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea or CSF rhinorrhea, can lead to a number of serious complications and possibly death if not addressed properly.\n\nRhinorrhea can occur as a symptom of opioid withdrawal accompanied by lacrimation. Other causes include cystic fibrosis, whooping cough, nasal tumors, hormonal changes, and cluster headaches. Due to changes in clinical practice, Rhinorrhea is now reported as a frequent side effect of oxygen-intubation during colonoscopy procedures [A simple, innovative way to reduce rhinitis symptoms after sedation during endoscopy\" by Nai-Liang Li, et al., Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology, 2011, Feb; volume 25(2): pages 68–72.]. Rhinorrhea can also be the side effect of several genetic disorders, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia.\n\nIn most cases,treatment for rhinorrhea is not necessary since it will clear up on its own—especially if it is the symptom of an infection. For general cases nose-blowing can get rid of the mucus buildup. Though blowing may be a quick-fix solution, it would likely proliferate mucosal production in the sinuses, leading to frequent and higher mucus buildups in the nose. Alternatively, saline nasal sprays and vasoconstrictor nasal sprays may also be used, but may become counterproductive after several days of use, causing rhinitis medicamentosa.\n\nIn recurring cases, such as those due to allergies, there are medicinal treatments available. For cases caused by histamine buildup, several types of antihistamines can be obtained relatively cheaply from drugstores.\n\nPeople who prefer to keep clear nasal passages, such as singers, who need a clear nasal passage to perform, may use a technique called nasal irrigation to prevent rhinorrhea. Nasal irrigation involves rinsing the nasal cavity regularly with salty water or commercial saline solutions.\n\n"}
{"id": "2143938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143938", "title": "Schuylkill Expressway", "text": "Schuylkill Expressway\n\nThe Schuylkill Expressway , locally known as \"the Schuylkill\", is a two to eight lane freeway through southwestern Montgomery County and the city of Philadelphia, and the easternmost segment of Interstate 76 in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It extends from the Valley Forge exit of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in King of Prussia, paralleling its namesake Schuylkill River for most of the route, to the Walt Whitman Bridge in South Philadelphia. It serves as the primary corridor into Philadelphia from points west. Maintenance and planning are administered through Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) District 6. \nConstructed over a period of ten years from 1949 to 1959, a large portion of the expressway predates the 1956 introduction of Interstate Highway System; many of these portions were not built to contemporary standards. The rugged terrain, limited riverfront space covered by the route and narrow spans of bridges passing over the highway have largely stymied later attempts to upgrade or widen the highway. With the road being highly over capacity, it has become notorious for its chronic congestion. An average of 163,000 vehicles use the road daily in Philadelphia County, and an average of 109,000 use the highway in Montgomery County, making it the busiest road in commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Its narrow lane and left shoulder configuration, left lane entrances and exits (nicknamed \"merge or die\"), common construction activity and generally congested conditions have led to many accidents, critical injuries and fatalities, leading to the highway's humorous nickname of the \"Surekill Expressway\" or in further embellishment, the \"Surekill Distressway\" or the “Surekill Crawlway\".\n\nThe Schuylkill Expressway begins at the Valley Forge Interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the community of King of Prussia in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County. The I-76 designation continues west on the Pennsylvania Turnpike from this point, while the Pennsylvania Turnpike from this point east is designated I-276. The road heads southeast from the trumpet interchange as a nine-lane freeway carrying four westbound lanes and five eastbound lanes that is designated as part of I-76, passing through the Valley Forge Interchange toll plaza. Past the toll plaza, the Schuylkill Expressway narrows to four lanes, with two lanes in each direction, and comes to an eastbound exit and entrance with Gulph Road, providing access to Valley Forge National Historical Park and the King of Prussia Town Center, and a westbound exit and entrance with Mall Boulevard, providing access to the King of Prussia mall to the northeast of the road. The freeway passes businesses and comes to an interchange with US 202, the eastern terminus of US 422, and Swedesford Road that serves King of Prussia. A westbound collector/distributor road carrying two lanes provides access to the US 202/US 422/Swedesford Road and Mall Boulevard interchanges. I-76 passes under the Chester Valley Trail and Norfolk Southern's Dale Secondary and continues east-southeast as a six-lane road between residential areas to the southwest and commercial areas to the northeast, eventually narrowing to four lanes. The freeway heads east and comes to a westbound exit and entrance with Gulph Road and Henderson Road. The Schuylkill Expressway curves southeast near wooded areas of homes before coming to an interchange with PA 320 in the community of Gulph Mills. This interchange has an eastbound exit and entrance and a westbound exit. Within this interchange, the highway passes over SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line and crosses Gulph Creek. Past the PA 320 interchange, I-76 continues east-southeast through woodland near residential development, heading into Lower Merion Township. The freeway enters the borough of West Conshohocken and comes to an interchange with I-476 that also has ramps providing access to PA 23 and serving the boroughs of West Conshohocken and Conshohocken.\nPast the I-476 interchange, the Schuylkill Expressway heads east and comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance providing access to PA 23 and Conshohocken, passing near residential and commercial development. The freeway passes over PA 23 and leaves West Conshohocken for Lower Merion Township, where it heads through wooded areas and runs on top of a cliff, with Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and the Schuylkill River parallel to the north below the cliff and another cliff rising above the highway to the south. East of Conshohocken at about mile marker 331, it curves sharply southeast in a 90-degree turn locally known as the \"Conshohocken Curve\" or \"Conshy Curve\", which has a history of traffic congestion and dangerous conditions. I-76 continues southeast through wooded areas, with the railroad tracks and the river parallel to the northeast. Farther southeast, the Schuylkill Expressway crosses Mill Creek and comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with Hollow Road that provides access to the community of Gladwyne. The freeway passes over the Flat Rock Tunnel carrying Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and continues to the southeast with the Schuylkill River to the northeast and the railroad tracks to the southwest. I-76 comes to a diamond interchange with Belmont Avenue and Green Lane, with Belmont Avenue heading south through the community of Bala Cynwyd in Lower Merion Township, and Green Lane crossing the river into the Philadelphia neighborhood of Manayunk. Following this interchange, the freeway passes under the Manayunk Bridge that carries an extension of the Cynwyd Heritage Trail across the Schuylkill River. The Schuykill Expressway passes over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and runs southeast between the West Laurel Hill Cemetery to the southwest and an industrial area to the northeast that is sandwiched between the railroad tracks and the river. I-76 comes to an interchange with City Avenue on the border of Lower Merion Township and the city of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County; City Avenue heads southwest as US 1 and northeast across the Schuylkill River on the City Avenue Bridges to an interchange with Ridge Avenue, Lincoln Drive, and Kelly Drive.\n\nPast the City Avenue interchange, I-76 enters the city of Philadelphia and becomes concurrent with US 1, with the Schuylkill Expressway widening to eight lanes and running between a yard on Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line and the river to the north and wooded areas of Fairmount Park to the south. US 1 splits from I-76 by heading northeast on the Roosevelt Expressway, while I-76 continues south on the Schuylkill Expressway, heading through Fairmount Park and running parallel to CSX's Trenton Subdivision, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River to the east. The freeway curves to the southwest, with CSX's Trenton Subdivision heading east away from the road and CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision beginning to run parallel. I-76 comes to a diamond interchange with Montgomery Drive that provides access to Fairmount Park and serves the Mann Center for the Performing Arts. Following this, the Schuylkill Expressway narrows to six lanes and turns to the southeast, running through more of the park with the railroad tracks, Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River parallel to the northeast. The freeway passes under CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision and comes to an interchange with US 13 and US 30 at Girard Avenue. Within this interchange, the highway passes under the Pennsylvania Railroad, Connecting Railway Bridge that carries Amtrak's Northeast Corridor across the Schuylkill River before heading under the Girard Avenue Bridge that carries US 13 (Girard Avenue) across the river. US 30 becomes concurrent with I-76 on the Schuylkill Expressway at this point and the road heads south, with the Philadelphia Zoo to the west and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, the Schuylkill River Trail, and the Schuylkill River still parallel to the east. The freeway turns southeast and runs between Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the southwest and the river drive, trail, and river to the northeast, with Boathouse Row on the opposite bank of the river. The Schuylkill Expressway comes to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance with Spring Garden Street, which heads east across the Schuylkill River towards the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The freeway continues south, heading east of a large Amtrak railroad yard, and comes to an interchange with the western terminus of I-676, which heads east along with US 30 on the Vine Street Expressway into Center City.\nFollowing this, I-76 narrows to four lanes and heads south between the Amtrak yard to the west and the Schuylkill River to the east. The road comes to an interchange with Market Street (PA 3) and 30th Street that provides access to the 30th Street Station that serves Amtrak, SEPTA Regional Rail, and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line along with the Cira Centre and University City. At this point, the Schuylkill Expressway dips below street level and runs in a tunnel sandwiched between 30th Street Station and the city's former main Post Office facility to the west and the river to the east, with Schuylkill Avenue running at street level above the tunnel and intersecting John F. Kennedy Boulevard (PA 3 west), Market Street (PA 3 east), Chestnut Street, and Walnut Street. Past the interchange, the freeway returns to ground level and runs southwest between Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to the northwest and the Schuylkill River to the southeast, coming to an interchange with South Street that has left entrances and exits. I-76 continues southwest alongside the river, with athletic fields belonging to the University of Pennsylvania to the northwest of the road. The Schuylkill Expressway passes under the Schuylkill Arsenal Railroad Bridge that carries CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision across the river before coming to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance providing access to University Avenue.\n\nFollowing this, the freeway passes over the Schuylkill River on the Schuylkill Expressway Bridge and heads into South Philadelphia. The highway passes over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision and heads south-southwest near urban residential and commercial areas and reaches a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with 34th Street just south of Wharton Street that provides access to Grays Ferry Avenue. I-76 widens to six lanes and continues south near urban development, curving southeast and running between the Philadelphia Gas Works to the southwest and urban neighborhoods to the northeast and reaching an eastbound interchange for 28th Street and a westbound interchange with Vare Avenue and Mifflin Street. The Schuylkill Expressway comes to an interchange with Passyunk Avenue and Oregon Avenue that also has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance to 26th Street that provides access to PA 291 and the Philadelphia International Airport. At this point, I-76 narrows to four lanes and turns south, with a CSX railroad branch parallel to the west and CSX's Harrisburg Subdivision parallel to the east. The freeway makes a sharp turn to the east and passes under the Harrisburg Subdivision, heading near commercial areas and coming to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance with the eastern terminus of PA 291 at Penrose Avenue, providing access to the Philadelphia International Airport. The Schuylkill Expressway continues east near urban residential neighborhoods and reaches an interchange with PA 611 (Broad Street). From here, I-76 widens to six lanes and passes north of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, coming to an interchange with 7th Street and Packer Avenue that has an eastbound exit and entrance and a westbound exit. A short distance later, the freeway comes to a westbound exit and eastbound entrance providing access to I-95 and Front Street. Immediately after, the road has a westbound toll plaza for the Walt Whitman Bridge. The freeway heads onto the seven-lane Walt Whitman Bridge, which carries it over Front Street, I-95, Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Swanson Street Industrial Track, industrial areas in the Port of Philadelphia, Christopher Columbus Boulevard, the Philadelphia Belt Line Railroad, and finally the Delaware River. At this point, the Schuylkill Expressway ends and I-76 continues into New Jersey.\n\nPlans for a limited-access highway along the west bank of the Schuylkill River originated in 1932, as part of a proposed cars-only parkway system for the Philadelphia area similar to the contemporary system being built in New York City. The \"Valley Forge Parkway\" was to have run from Fairmount Park to Valley Forge State Park, with plans for a later extension to Reading via Pottstown. However, planning for the proposed parkway system stalled and the plan was eventually abandoned.\n\nPlanning for today's expressway began in 1947, when the city of Philadelphia approved plans to develop a highway connecting the city with the terminus of the planned Philadelphia Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Valley Forge. The highway was designed by engineers Michael Rapuano, who had previously aided in the design of the Garden State Parkway, and Bill Allen of Gannett Fleming. The new expressway largely followed the earlier planned parkway route from Valley Forge to Fairmount Park, while also extending into southern Philadelphia and across the Delaware River into New Jersey. Two alternatives were proposed south of University City: one routing would continue along the west bank of the river into Southwest Philadelphia to its confluence near Philadelphia International Airport, where it would tunnel underneath the Delaware to Paulsboro, New Jersey; the other would cross the Schuylkill south of University City and bisect South Philadelphia, crossing the Delaware into Gloucester City, New Jersey. Planned expansions of the airport in the path of the former proposal led to adoption of the routing through South Philadelphia.\n\nConstruction of the road began in 1949. The road was completed in stages, with a short segment near King of Prussia opening in 1951 along with the Turnpike's Philadelphia Extension, with the section from King of Prussia to Conshohocken opening a year later. The section between Conshohocken and City Avenue opened in 1954. The Walt Whitman Bridge opened in 1957. The expressway was completed through Fairmount Park in 1959, and in 1960 the entire expressway was complete with the opening of the segment through University City. \n\nThe Schuylkill Expressway was initially designated as PA 43 and was cosigned with I-80S between King of Prussia and Center City Philadelphia and I-680 between Center City Philadelphia and the Walt Whitman Bridge when the Interstate Highway System was designated in 1956. On April 16, 1963, Pennsylvania wanted to renumber its Interstate numbers. Part of this was the renumbering from I-80S into I-76, and all of its auxiliary routes into I-x76. The Federal Highway Administration approved the request on February 26, 1964. As a result, I-80S became I-76 and I-680 became I-676. In addition to this renumbering, the PA 43 designation was removed from the Schuylkill Expressway. In 1972, the I-76 and the I-676 designations were switched onto their current routes, with the entire length of the Schuylkill Expressway designated as I-76. \nImmediately after its completion, operational studies performed on the Schuylkill Expressway found that the route would be unable to cope with the area's growing traffic demands, due to the many substandard design elements and compromises incorporated to cope with the rugged, difficult routing of the road. In 1962, plans were announced for a parallel expressway along the east bank of the Schuylkill, known as the Manayunk Expressway; however, these plans were quickly withdrawn due to substantial opposition. An alternative plan was then introduced to widen the entire highway to eight lanes in time for the United States Bicentennial in 1976; however, these plans were also shelved due to local disapproval. A scaled-down widening project was successfully undertaken from 1969 to 1972 to widen a short section of the road to six lanes through Fairmount Park.\nIn the decades since its opening, congestion on the expressway has steadily increased. Plans to expand the expressway to eight lanes by building an upper deck, including high-occupancy toll lanes, were advocated by former Pennsylvania House Speaker John Perzel, but have not come to fruition due to a lack of funding. PennDOT has planned a $23.7 million project, with testing by fall 2008, to add 29 webcams on the Schuylkill Expressway between the Conshohocken Curve and Passyunk Avenue.\nOn the afternoon of June 8, 2011, a section of the Schuylkill Expressway near Grays Ferry Avenue buckled from temperatures around , causing lane closures. The closed lane of the road was later reopened after temporary repairs, but will require full repairs.\n\nOn September 8, 2011, heavy rains caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee caused a rockslide in the vicinity of the Conshohocken Curve, flooding near Belmont Avenue and a mudslide by Girard Avenue. For hours, motorists were either stuck between the Blue Route and Girard Avenue or had to get off at the I-476 interchange until the mess could be cleaned up.\n\nIn May 2011, a new westbound entrance was completed at South Gulph Road and South Henderson Road in King of Prussia. A westbound exit opened at this same location in November 2011. The new interchange cost $10.5 million and used money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\nPennDOT undertook an $8 million project that would help reduce traffic congestion along the highway. By the middle of 2019, PennDOT plans to implement variable speed limit signs along the Schuylkill Expressway, where the speed limit can be lowered due to factors such as inclement weather or accidents. The project will also implement queue warning, which will use variable message signs to alert motorists to traffic congestion ahead and also coordinate with SEPTA to provide motorists real-time mass transit information to give commuters an option to exit the highway and use public transportation to finish their trip. There are also future plans to coordinate traffic signals on roads leading to the Schuylkill Expressway and install ramp meters on entrance ramps to the highway. PennDOT is in the preliminary stages of studying plans to use the right shoulder of the Schuylkill Expressway as a travel lane in certain sections during peak periods; construction of these lanes is not expected to begin until the 2020s.\n\nMileposts and exit numbers reflect the entire length of I-76, which is concurrent with the Pennsylvania Turnpike from the Ohio state line to the Valley Forge Interchange. \n\n"}

{"id": "2143953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143953", "title": "High and Mighty Color", "text": "High and Mighty Color\n\nHigh and Mighty Color (stylized as HIGH and MIGHTY COLOR) was a Japanese rock band active from 2003 to 2010. They had two vocalists; a male and a female.\n\nThe band started in Okinawa when Sassy and Meg left a Metallica cover band after they decided to make their own music. Sassy offered Mackaz the opportunity to join their new band, he accepted and invited long time friend Kazuto to join as well. Meg sat in on a school performance one day, and Yuusuke's voice stood out to him, so he offered him a chance to join the band. Initially Yuusuke declined due to wanting to be a solo singer, but joined after Meg reportedly asked him to join every day for nearly four months. The band, known as Anti-Nobunaga at this time, played mainly in small coffee shops and art theaters for about a year. Sassy, the bandleader, sent demo tapes to every major Japanese label, all of whom rejected the band. It was not until a small label signed the band that they found their first big break. Anti-Nobunaga were now playing areas further from their local hometown and eventually landed a spot at the yearly music festival of Okinawa.\n\nDuring the summer of 2003, at the yearly music festival in Okinawa, the band's label promoted their spot and eventually they ended up playing for a sold-out crowd. Due to this festival being a \"per show\" ticket selling one, it meant that Anti-Nobunaga was the only band to play for a sold-out crowd. A scout for a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Japan was in the crowd and offered the band the chance to produce music for an upcoming various artists album entitled \"Okinawa 2003\". The band then composed their two and only completely original songs under the name of Anti-Nobunaga entitled \"Meaning\" and \"Hate You!\". At another festival known as the \"Music Picnic Festival\", vocalist Mākii also grabbed the attention of the same scout that found Anti-Nobunaga. The scout felt that both projects on their own were not remarkable, but combined, the band could be something never before seen on the Japanese music scene. Mākii first rejected the offer due to her wanting to study English abroad, but was later convinced by her future bandmates to watch them perform. After she was impressed by the band's energy, Mākii agreed to join them. With the addition of Mākii the band took on a new name, High and Mighty Color. After six months of perfecting their craft, they moved up from SMJ's minor label to their major label, in league with bands such as Orange Range. High and Mighty Color is some times referred to as the sister band of Orange Range, because they are both from the Okinawa area, an area known for musical fusion thanks in part to various military bases stationed there and were both discovered at the same music festival. They spent much of 2004 writing and recording, in late 2004 they released their first single, \"Over\" which was only sold through Tower Records stores. It sold out in a month and became immensely scarce, thus it was re-released the next year. The album sat at number one spot of the indie Oricon charts for an entire month.\n\nDuring 2005, the band released their first major single, \"Pride\". It was originally going to be attached to a Japanese football event being held at the same time, but was picked up for something else. A Sunrise music partner was looking for a song to use for \"Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny\" and \"Pride\" was chosen to be that song. At the time, the show was the number one rated anime, and being attached to this helped the single's sales immensely. With a final sales count of 223,208 copies, \"Pride\" remains the band's best selling single of their career.\n\nOver the next year, the band went on a media blitz, performing for shows such as \"Music Fighter\", \"Music Station\" and \"Hey! Hey! Hey!\" at various times. During August, the band released \"Days\", their fourth single, selling 7,679 copies and not breaking the top 20 mark on the Oricon charts. Despite this setback, the band was still honored with the Japanese Record Grand Prix's \"Rookie of the Year\" award, and Mākii's grandmother who had just died was given a tribute just before their performance.\n\nIn April 2006, the band released their second album \"Gou on Progressive\" after only releasing two singles for the album. The album sold less copies than their first album, but it stayed on the Oricon charts longer and managed to gain a higher peak position than their first album. The band's first single of the year was \"Ichirin no Hana\" and was used as the third opening to the anime adaption of \"Bleach\". This was their first and only single to break the top five mark on the Oricon charts since their debut with \"Pride.\" They also played their first American concert at an anime convention in Houston, Texas on April 28.\n\nThe band then went on a large-scale tour of Japan. They played 65 venues over the course of the next five months. They released their seventh single, \"Dive into Yourself\", in August. The song was used as the opening theme of the video game \"Sengoku Basara II\". For a time this was the band's second lowest selling single and was also their lowest ranking single among the Oricon charts, only managing to reach the 24th spot on the weekly charts. Their 8th single \"Enrai ~Tooku ni Aru Akari~\" was released on October 25 and used as the ending theme for the third \"\" compilation movie. The single entered the charts 12 spots higher than \"Dive into Yourself\" at number 12. \"Energy\", a B-side song from the \"Style ~Get Glory in this Hand~\" single, was used in a tribute compilation album composed for the movie \"Death Note: The Last Name\".\n\nMākii made her acting debut with the December 2006 movie, \"Anata wo Wasurenai (I Won't Forget You)\". The band performed two songs for the film, \"Tadoritsuku Basho\", the film's theme song, and \"Oxalis\", an insert song. The two songs were released as a double A-side single, \"Tadoritsuku Basho/Oxalis\". When \"Anata wo Wasurenai\" was released, it entered the Japanese box offices in the 10th position. Also, \"Resistance\" was used as the theme song for the Nintendo DS game, \"\".\n\nOn February 4, the official High and Mighty Color website released various 30 second previews of songs from the band's third album, \"San\", which was released on February 21. The album contained 15 tracks with 10 being new releases. The album was ranked number 10 on the Oricon daily rankings during its first day and 16th on the weekly charts.\n\nIn March, it was announced that Yūsuke would work with former Porno Graffitti bassist, Masami Shiratama. Yūsuke provided vocals for the joint single entitled \"Honnō\", the single was released on May 23 featured Yūsuke using what the band describes as his \"machine gun vocals\".\n\nThe band also made their second American performance on May 11 and May 12 during 2007's Anime Central anime convention.\n\nThe 10th single from the band was released on August 1, 2007. The title track, \"Dreams\", was used as the second ending theme to the anime \"Darker Than Black\". During its first week, the single entered the Oricon charts at the 24th spot.\n\nOn November 4, 2007, the band announced the release of a single collection album entitled \"10 Color Singles\" featuring their first 10 singles and a bonus track, \"Ichirin no Hana (Live Studio Version)\". It also includes a DVD with music videos that never made it to DVD like; \"Style\", \"Dreams\", \"Here I Am\", and the new music video for \"Mushroom\". In December, they contributed to \"\", covering Luna Sea's song \"Rosier\".\n\nHigh and Mighty Color's 12th single, \"Flashback/Komorebi no Uta\", was released on February 27, 2008. It was their second double a-side single and was used in promotion with the anime series \"Hero Tales\". Their 4th album, \"Rock Pit\", was released on March 19 and became their lowest selling album.\n\nThe band began the fourth volume of their \"Live Bee Loud\" tour on March 17, 2008 at the famous Club Quattro in Japan. They then went on to perform at 13 other venues across the country, with the final venue being in their hometown of Okinawa. The 13th single of the band, \"Hot Limit\", is a cover of one of T.M. Revolution's early singles. The visual style of both the music video and the promotional images is meant to mimic that of the original. This was also the first time since \"Dive into Yourself\" that Sony Music Entertainment had produced a commercial for advertisement of a single from the band. The single went on to garner the best sales for the band in nearly two years and ranked at number 20 on the Oricon charts in the weekly rankings for its first week.\n\nOn July 1, 2008, it was announced that Mākii had married Dreams Come True singer Masato Nakamura on June 22, 2008 and would be leaving the band by the end of the year. In her parting message, Mākii thanked her fellow band members and all of their fans for supporting her and the group for such a long time. A special event was planned for Mākii's graduation from the band as well as at least one more single. It was also announced that the band will begin searching for a new vocalist in early 2009.\n\nHigh and Mighty Color appeared at the Zepp in Nagoya, alongside 175R, One Ok Rock and Gollbetty, on August 15 as part of the \"Steal The Show Friday Night\" lineup. The 14th single from the band, \"Remember\", was released on October 15, 2008 and is their final single featuring Mākii.\n\nThe band transferred to Spice Records on January 1, 2009. Spice Records was an Okinawa based studio that maintained minor rights to the band while under SME. The first live DVD from the band was released on January 25 and reached the 11th spot on the Oricon weekly DVD charts, reaching a peak of 9th on the daily charts. After the departure of Mākii, the band began auditions for a replacement vocalist; the auditions were open to women for a month before call backs and performances were done. On February 9, 2009, the band announced that a replacement vocalist was found, whose information would soon be added to their website after an extensive overhaul. The band planned to begin working on a summer single and live tour to promote the new vocalist in May. The first single, titled \"XYZ\", featuring the band's new vocalist Halca, was released on iTunes in both Japan and Australia on July 8, 2009.\n\nThe band released their fifth album, \"Swamp Man\", on September 2, 2009 and took the 25th spot on the Oricon charts on its release date.\n\nFollowing the release of the album, High and Mighty Color released a tribute song for two popular manga named \"Red\". The song was released digitally in Japan on December 9, 2009 and re-released December 23, 2009 on iTunes Japan and Japan Files.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, the band was scheduled to give a live concert with Halca, titled \"Night Light Parade Vol. 1.1: One of the New Beginning\" at Shibuya Club Quattro in Tokyo.\n\nIt was announced on May 19 that on August 11 High and Mighty Color would release a single, \"\", which would be the band's last. Explaining the breakup, band members cited \"musical differences\" and \"future opportunities\". \"Re:ache\" contained three new songs, with four songs in total, the fourth being a live rendition of \"Red\". The single was bundled with a DVD of the music videos for \"Re:ache\" and \"Good Bye\", as well as live recordings of their American concert from Sakura-Con 2010.\n\nAfter the band broke up, the members began separate activities. In 2017, Mackaz and Sassy reunited with Mākii to form the new band DracoVirgo.\n\n\n\n"}

The most radical departure from previous designs was the shedding of tumblehome and adoption of vertical sides, shared by the \"Hercule\" and \"Suffren\" classes; this significantly increased the space available for upper batteries, but reduced the stability of the ship.\n\n\"Valmy\" was laid down at Brest in 1838 as \"Formidable\" and launched in 1847.\n\nShe displayed poor performances during her trials, especially with a tendency to roll, and was generally considered a failure. Stability problems were to some extent improved by the addition of a high belt of wood sheathing at the waterline. The outcome of the project led the French Navy to return to a more traditional design with the next generation of ships, which would lead to \"Bretagne\".\n\n\"Valmy\" participated in the Crimean War, where she proved difficult to manoeuvre and, like other sailing vessels, often had to be towed by steam ships. During the bombardment of Sevastopol, the only time \"Valmy\" fired her guns in anger, she was towed by the new steam two-decker \"Napoléon\".\n\nOn 13 November 1855, \"Valmy\" collided with the French schooner \"Etoile du Nord\" in the Mediterranean Sea. The schooner was dismasted and \"Valmy\" put in to Málaga, Spain. She returned to Brest in 1855, where she was disarmed. In 1864, she was renamed \"Borda\" and became a training hulk for the French Naval Academy. Upon her replacement in 1890, she was renamed \"Intrépide\". She was stricken from the navy list in 1891 and scrapped soon afterwards.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143978", "title": "Traveler (mascot)", "text": "Traveler (mascot)\n\nTraveler is a horse who is the mascot of the University of Southern California. Traveler appears at all USC home football games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as well as many other outdoor events, including numerous Rose Parades. The current horse is Traveler IX. Although the Traveler web site describes Traveler as \"pure white,\" most of the horses who have served as Traveler are actually gray horses whose hair coats have become completely white. (Truly white horses are quite uncommon.) The rider, dressed as an idealized Trojan warrior, is often mistaken for Tommy Trojan, the Trojan portrayed in USC's famous Trojan Shrine statue; however, the rider is unnamed and simply designated as a Trojan warrior with the horse as the official mascot. On November 6, 2013, the costumed version of Tommy and Traveler were introduced for men's and women's basketball games.\n\nUntil it was renovated in the 1990s, the Coliseum included an Olympic running track going around the football field. This proved to be useful for Traveler, who would gallop around the track after every USC score and pump up the crowd. Once the track was removed, Traveler still made its way around the field but had to move cautiously to avoid people on the sidelines. The horse had a minor collision with a person in 2000, and afterwards had human spotters running in front to clear a path.\n\nBefore Traveler, USC used another mascot, a series of canines known as George Tirebiter. There had also been several previous, unofficial horse mascots making appearances on USC sidelines since 1927, but none were permanent. The idea for the current mascot began during the 1961 Rose Parade, when a USC events director spotted Richard Saukko and his white horse, Traveler, marching in the parade. The university persuaded Saukko to ride his horse during USC football games.\n\nTraveler was introduced in the autumn of 1961, during the USC Trojans football team's home opener at the Coliseum, against the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. To dress Saukko as a Trojan warrior, USC used its connections to the film industry to procure the costume worn by Charlton Heston in \"Ben Hur\" two years earlier. The costume proved to be too heavy for extended use, so Saukko made his own leather uniform for the 1962 season and the same costume has been used since. The name was believed to have been inspired by the gray horse Traveller, ridden by Civil War Confederate general Robert E. Lee, In August 2017 concerns that the horse's name had a connection to Lee led to further research, which revealed that the first Traveler was acquired with his name, spelled with one L, in 1958 after he had become unreliable as a movie horse. On Equinespot.com, Traveler is listed as one of the six most common horse names to begin with the letter T. \n\nAfter Saukko retired from riding the horse in 1988, his family continued to provide the successive horses acting as Traveler until 2002. All of Saukko's successors as rider have been USC alumni, including Cass Dabbs, Rick Oas, Tom Nolan, Ardeshir Radpour, Brent Dahlgren, and current riders Chuck O'Donnell and Hector Aguilar.\n\nSeveral horses have been \"Traveler\" over the years, of breeds ranging from Tennessee Walking horses, to Arabian horses and some crossbred animals. The current mascot, Traveler IX, is a purebred Andalusian horse, owned by Joanne Asman. An eighth Traveler was in training, but according to a post on the Spirit of Troy Facebook account, Traveler 8 died on or about October 8, 2013. \"It is with Sadness that I let you all know that Traveler number 8 who many of you did not have the opportunity to meet passed away. He was only 14 years old. For those who had the opportunity to see this bold, arched neck, beautiful creature run on the field for some of the games last year, he will be missed. Most of the fans did not realize when we switched Traveler 7 & Traveler 8 out, but for those who did know, he will be missed. Traveler 7 continues forward for his 11th year as Traveler.\" Traveler VII was retired as the mascot following the 2017 Rose Bowl Game, with Traveler IX being introduced at the first USC home game of the 2017 season against Western Michigan.\n\n"}

Palermo was conquered in 831 and became the new capital. Syracuse fell in 878 and in 902 the last Byzantine outpost, Taormina, was taken. At the same time various Muslim incursions into southern Italy occurred, with new Emirates being founded in Tropea, Taranto and Bari. During this period there were constant power struggles amongst the Muslims. Nominally the island was under rule of the Aghlabids and later the Fatimids.\n\nAfter successfully suppressing a revolt the Fatimid caliph appointed al-Hasan al-Kalbi (948–953) as Emir of Sicily, the first of the Kalbid dynasty. The Fatimids appointed the Kalbids as rulers via proxy before they shifted their capital from Ifriqiya to Cairo in 969. Raids into southern Italy continued under the Kalbids into the 11th century, and in 982 a German army under Otto II was defeated by Abu'l-Qasim in the Battle of Stilo near Crotone in Calabria. The dynasty began a steady period of decline with the Emirate of Yusuf al-Kalbi (990-998) who entrusted the island to his sons and created space for interference from the Zirids of Ifriqiya. Under al-Akhal (1017–1037) the dynastic conflict intensified, with factions allying themselves variously with Byzantium and the Zirids. Even though neither of these powers could establish themselves in Sicily permanently, under Hasan as-Samsam (1040–1053) the island fragmented into small fiefdoms. The Kalbids died out in 1053, and in 1061 the Normans of southern Italy arrived under Roger I of Sicily and began their conquest, which was completed in 1091. The Muslims were allowed to remain and played an important role in the administration, army and economy of the Norman kingdom until the 12th century.\n\nUnder the Kalbid dynasty, Sicily, and especially Palermo, was an important economic centre of the Mediterranean. The Muslims introduced lemons, Seville oranges and sugar cane, as well as cotton and mulberries for sericulture, and built irrigation systems for agriculture. Sicily was also an important hub for trade between the Near East, North Africa and the Italian maritime republics such as Amalfi, Pisa and Genoa.\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated from Lawrence Academy, Groton, Massachusetts, in 1942, and then attended California College of Commerce in Long Beach from 1946 to 1948. He was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration by the college in 1956, when he completed requirements while assigned to the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program at Southern Methodist University.\n\nHarlow jointed the United States Army in August 1942 during World War II and was assigned to the Army Air Corps. He attended Armament School and upon completion was an instructor in the Aircraft Armament Ground School. He transferred to the personnel career field in 1945 and advanced to the grade of staff sergeant prior to his discharge from active duty in February 1946. He then became a member of the Air Force Reserve.\n\nIn August 1950, during the Korean War, Harlow was recalled to active duty and assigned as the personnel chief clerk, 5th and 9th Maintenance Squadrons, Travis Air Force Base, Calif. He has held various positions in the personnel career field, increasing in responsibility. He was promoted to chief master sergeant in April 1963 after a total of 16 years active duty.

Barrie is located north of Toronto.\n\nThe event is also referred to as \"Live 8 Toronto\" or \"Live 8 Canada\".\n\nAbout 35,000 people, full capacity at Park Place, were at the event, ranking eighth in attendance among the ten July 2 Live 8 concerts. Had a larger venue been available, organizers originally expected upwards of 150,000 spectators at the show. (\"see Location\").\n\nPast Live Aid performers are listed with an asterisk (*). In order of appearance:\n\n\nSibling duo Tegan and Sara were slated to be in the lineup, but had to drop out close to the date due to illness. Likewise, Burton Cummings was to perform with Randy Bachman, but also didn't attend, apparently also due to illness.\n\nFor weeks leading up to the concert, several locations were considered as potential hosts for the Canadian Live 8 concert.\n\nParliament Hill, Ottawa, Ontario was the first choice for the concert. However, on June 10, the federal Public Works and Canadian Heritage departments, along with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police rejected the idea of using the site for Live 8. Government officials felt that Parliament Hill, with a capacity of 75,000 people was too small for the event, which was originally expected to attract over 150,000 participants. They were also concerned about damage to the local buildings and grounds.\n\nOn June 15, Bob Geldof announced Toronto, Ontario as the host of the Canadian Live 8 concert. At that point, several venues were considered as candidates for the concert: Downsview Park, which hosted the Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto concert and a World Youth Day mass; Exhibition Place, which also hosted World Youth Day activities; Molson Amphitheatre, and Sunnyside Beach, which would have involved floating stages on Lake Ontario. Ultimately, none of these considerations were used for the concert. There were several financial and logistical problems related to these bids. For example, both Downsview Park and Molson Amphitheatre were hosting concerts on Canada Day (the day before Live 8) and it was impossible to set up the Live 8 stage a day before the concert.\n\nOn June 21, Park Place in Barrie, Ontario was finally announced as the official venue for the Canadian Live 8 concert by promoter, Michael Cohl.\n"}

The ironclads crossed Stono Bar and entered Charleston Harbor on 6 April, but a heavy fog stopped their advance lest they run aground attempting to negotiate the tricky channels leading to the vital Confederate port. Though dawn broke clear the next morning, an ebb tide kept the warships from getting underway until noon. Shortly after 15:00, 's guns opened on Fort Sumter, and through the afternoon Du Pont's ships stubbornly hammered at Confederate batteries while withstanding the intense and accurate converging fire of the Southern cannon.\n\nWith darkness approaching and his ironclads severely battered, Du Pont broke off the action, determined to return to the fray at daybreak. That night, however, reports from his captains of the serious damage suffered by their ships convinced him that the small chance of success of another attack did not justify the great risk to his squadron.\n\nIn the fighting, \"Nahant\" had been hit 36 times, disabling her turret and breaking off a large piece of iron inside her pilot house, killing her helmsman and wounding her pilot and two others. The whole fleet took 13 casualties. The next day, with her sister monitors, she retired to Port Royal for repairs.\n\nOn 10 June, after intelligence reports indicated that the ram was preparing to attack wooden blockader , Du Pont ordered \"Weehawken\", Captain John Rodgers, and \"Nahant\" to Wassaw Sound, Georgia to await the powerful ironclad ram. Shortly before dawn, a week later, \"Atlanta\", accompanied by stern wheel gunboat and ram , steamed down the Wilmington River and entered Wassaw Sound to attack the monitors. The Confederate flagship carried a torpedo projecting from her bow, hoping to explode it against one of the monitors before dispatching the other with her guns.\n\nSeeing the Southern ships approach, \"Weehawken\" and \"Nahant\" headed in to accept the challenge. As the adversaries closed to fighting range, \"Atlanta\" was first to fire, but soon ran aground, where she could not aim her guns effectively. The monitors held their fire until within . \"Weehawken\" then quickly put five rounds from her heavy guns into the ram. With two of his guns out of action, two of his three pilots severely wounded, and his ship hard aground, Cdr. William A. Webb, CSN, was compelled to surrender \"Atlanta\" while her escorts scurried to safety. \"Atlanta\" was subsequently purchased from a prize court by the Federal Government and commissioned in the Union Navy.\n\nEarly in July, after he had taken command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Rear Adm. John A. Dahlgren ordered the monitors back to Charleston harbor. \"Nahant\", now under the command of William Kennon Mayo, and her sisters bombarded Confederate works on Morris Island on July 10, supporting and covering the landing of Army troops. For almost two months, the shelling continued until the steadfast defenders were finally compelled to abandon Battery Wagner, their last position on the island, on September 6.\n\nIn ensuing months, \"Nahant\" continued operations in the vicinity of Charleston, patrolling, enforcing the blockade, and bombarding Confederate positions ashore. On November 15, she joined in supporting the Union Army at Cumming's Point on Morris Island during a heavy evening bombardment from Fort Moultrie. The next day, despite heavy shelling from shore batteries, she helped refloat \"Lehigh\" after her sister monitor had run aground.\n\nOn February 2, 1865, \"Nahant\" joined \"Lehigh\" and in shelling the Confederate blockade runner \"Presto\" after the blockade runner had run ashore under the batteries of Fort Moultrie. After three days of shelling, the hulk was completely destroyed.\n\n\"Nahant\" decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 11, 1865. While laid up, she was renamed Atlas on June 15, 1869, but resumed the name \"Nahant\" on August 10. The veteran monitor recommissioned at League Island on April 12, 1898 and steamed to New York City for harbor defense during the Spanish–American War. \"Nahant\" decommissioned at League Island and was laid up there until sold on April 6, 1904, to L. E. Hunt of Melrose, Massachusetts.\n\nLife aboard \"Nahant\" during the Civil War was documented in a book titled \"A Year on a Monitor and the Destruction of Fort Sumter\" by Alvah F Hunter. In 1862 Hunter enlisted in the Union Navy, with difficulty as he was only 16. He served for a year on \"Nahant\" as a cabin boy, keeping a careful diary. Later in life he wrote the book, which stands as one of the few detailed accounts of wartime routine on a monitor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2143998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143998", "title": "Amtrak paint schemes", "text": "Amtrak paint schemes\n\nAmtrak has used a variety of liveries on its rolling stock since taking over intercity passenger rail service in the United States in 1971. A series of six schemes termed \"Phases\", first introduced in 1972, have seen the widest use. Phases primarily use geometric arrangements of red, white, and blue—the national colors of the United States—part of Amtrak's patriotic visual identity.\n\nAmtrak began operations in May 1971 with a mixture of equipment still painted in the distinct liveries of the freight railroads that relinquished their passenger service to Amtrak. Amtrak picked and chose equipment that it determined to be in the best condition, and elected not to keep the same rolling stock on the same routes. Since (prior to Amtrak's operation) one almost never found rolling stock from anywhere in the country on any train, let alone rolling stock from competing railroads mixed together on the same train, that period was later known as the Rainbow Era.\n\nTo build the brand of Amtrak as a unified passenger railroad, the rolling stock was gradually repainted into system-wide Phases starting around 1972 with Phase I. The Phases are sequentially numbered using Roman numerals. Phases were painted on all rolling stock, with locomotives and passenger cars often painted in different styles of the same Phase. Most current locomotives use the 2000-introduced Phase V, while passenger cars use the 2002-introduced Phase VI. A modified Phase III scheme was introduced for some equipment in 2013. Non-revenue equipment uses bright lime green or a variation of Phase V.\n\nThe three routes under the Amtrak California branch—the \"Capitol Corridor\", \"Pacific Surfliner\", and \"San Joaquin\"—use equipment painted in several custom schemes, as do the \"Cascades\" and \"Piedmont\". Amtrak has repainted equipment in unique livery for special uses, including its 40th anniversary in 2011 and to promote the Operation Lifesaver safety campaign. Equipment has also been wrapped for advertising promotions. When testing equipment from other railroads, Amtrak has mostly kept existing livery, though some longer-term tests used Phase schemes.\n\nWhen Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail service on May 1, 1971, it inherited a collection of rolling stock from twenty different railroads, each with its own distinct colors and logos. Needing only to operate 184 of the 366 trains that had been run nationwide by the private railroads, Amtrak was able to pick the 1,200 best passenger cars to lease from the 3,000 that the private railroads had owned. This equipment was haphazardly mixed to form consists, resulting in trains with the mismatched colors of several predecessor railroads. This \"Rainbow Era\" was short-lived; Amtrak began purchasing some of the leased equipment in mid-1971, setting the stage for wholesale repainting from 1972 to 1974.\nIntroduced in 1972, Phase I was the first paint scheme to be implemented system-wide on Amtrak's trains. Except for a small number of locomotives that had been painted into experimental and promotional paint schemes, it was the first new paint for most equipment under Amtrak. The scheme was part of Amtrak's larger move to a visual identity featuring the national colors of red, white, and blue.\n\nLocomotives were painted a light gray (\"Platinum Mist\") with a black roof, the Amtrak \"Pointless Arrow\" chevron logo on the side, and a red nose (which led to a \"Bloody Nose\" nickname). Passenger cars were silver (or left bare stainless steel), with a red and bright blue stripe (bracketed by thin white stripes) at window level and the chevron logo at one or both ends. A number of variants were made for non-revenue locomotives, GG1 locomotives, Turbotrain and Turboliner trainsets, and self-propelled RDC and Metroliner railcars.\nThe Phase II paint scheme was introduced in late 1974 with the arrival of the new GE E60 locomotives. The red nose and chevron logo on locomotives were replaced with stripes similar to passenger cars. Most passenger cars were essentially unchanged from Phase I, except for the removal of the chevron logo; new Sightseer lounges had a higher stripe with an angled transition on each end.\nPhase III, introduced in 1976, is still used on some equipment. On both passenger cars and locomotives, the outer white pinstripes were removed while the inner stripe was widened, resulting in red, white, and blue stripes of equal width. Turboliners and the LRC test train were painted in white, with the stripes at the bottom of the train. This scheme was introduced \"for safety, graphic aid and saving money\", as the white band was highly reflective and provided a place for car information, and the standard widths made better use of raw material.\n\nSeveral types of locomotives that were acquired later were given variations on Phase III. AEM-7 locomotives had the blue stripe expanded to cover the entire lower part of the body. On Dash 8-32BWH locomotives, a deeper blue and red was used; the stripes had additional pinstripes and angled upward across the middle of the body. The similarity to the Pepsi logo led to the units being nicknamed \"Pepsi Cans\". Genesis locomotives had a lighter roof and narrower white stripe; the stripes angled downward on the sloped nose, and faded towards the rear. That variant was created by industrial designer Cesar Vergara, who also designed the angular bodies of the locomotives.\n\nIn October 2013, Amtrak introduced a new variant of Phase III with the production of the new Viewliner II cars, the first of which entered service in 2015. The Viewliner cars have some changes from previous Phase III passenger cars, including a red reflective stripe at the bottom and a newer (\"Travelmark\") logo. In January 2016, Amtrak revealed a P32AC-DM that was repainted into Phase III, similar to that of the heritage units 145 and 822, but featuring modern logos and \"Empire Service\" emblems on the sides. All P32AC-DMs will eventually be repainted into this scheme, with costs shared between Amtrak and the state of New York.\n\nBeginning in 1993, Phase IV was introduced as a striking departure from the traditional red, white, and blue style seen previously. Brought into service with the delivery of the newer Superliner II cars, Phase IV has two thin red stripes and a thick dark blue stripe. In 1997, Amtrak extended the scheme to locomotives, initially GE P42DC diesel locomotives on Northeast Corridor services. \nPhase V was introduced with the arrival of the \"Acela Express\" high-speed train sets in 2000 and is used on most locomotives. Locomotives are painted light gray, with a blue stripe (darker than Phases I–III, but lighter than IV) at the top and a thin red reflective stripe at the bottom. The blue stripe has a wavy bottom on Genesis locomotives and a flat bottom on other locomotives and ex-F40PH non-powered control units (NPCUs). The Amtrak \"Travelmark\" logo is painted near the front or rear of the unit. SC-44 locomotives used on Midwest routes have a variant of Phase V with a blue front and a halftone transition into the grey side. Non-passenger cars like \"Auto Train\" autoracks are all-gray except for the logo and red stripe; Express Box Cars had blue stripes on top and bottom.\n\n\"Acela Express\" trainsets have grey and stainless steel bodies with the lower red stripe, with the wavy blue roof and Acela logo on the power cars only. The Acela passenger cars have no blue stripe; colored blobs called \"mobiles\" are used to indicate the type of car (Business Class, Cafe Bistro, or First Class). When the \"Acela Express\" was introduced, regional trains on the Northeast Corridor were briefly designated \"Acela Regional\". Amfleet coaches for these trains received \"Capstone\" livery, which had a window stripe with various patterns of blue, light blue, and green to indicate the type of service. Rebuilt Turboliners had a similar variant of the Capstone livery.\nPhase VI, commonly referred to as Phase IVb, introduced in 2002, is used on most passenger cars. It retains the same stripe style as Phase IV: wide window stripes on single-level cars, and narrow stripes on Superliners. The red reflective sill stripe and mid-tone blue on Phase V are used. Single-level cars have white logos within the blue stripe, while Superliners have blue logos below the stripes.\nFive state-funded corridor routes—the \"Cascades\", \"Capitol Corridor\", \"Pacific Surfliner\", \"Piedmont\", and \"San Joaquin\"—are operated by Amtrak using equipment that is largely owned by the states in which they operate, and painted in custom schemes that deviate from the national Amtrak livery. Several other route-specific paint schemes have been used in the past.\n\nThe three routes under the Amtrak California branch—the \"Capitol Corridor\", \"Pacific Surfliner\", and \"San Joaquin\"—use equipment painted in several custom schemes. The \"Capitol Corridor\" and \"San Joaquin\" largely use California Cars and F59PHI locomotives painted in the state colors of blue and yellow. Locomotives are grey with a navy blue underside, yellow bottom stripe, black roof, and navy blue cab area; Caltrans and Amtrak California logos are prominent. The California Cars are stainless steel with a black upper window stripe, a navy blue lower window stripe with a yellow pinstripe, and orange triangles next to boarding doors. Newer Siemens SC-44 Charger locomotives have navy blue curved shapes on the front and rear with yellow accents, a black cab area, and Amtrak California logos on the front and sides. Single-level Comet IB and Horizon cars used on the \"San Joaquin\" have a yellow bottom stripe and a navy blue window stripe with orange, turquoise, and light blue accents. Several NPCUs used for the service are grey with turquoise and light blue stripes and curve towards the top rear of the locomotive, red chevron stripes on the front (a nod to a 1985 Caltrain paint scheme), and yellow grab bars.\n\nThe \"Pacific Surfliner\" uses SC-44 Charger locomotives and Surfliner cars in a deep blue and gray paint scheme. The upper half of the passenger cars are deep blue with a white pinstriping, plus a white pinstripe on the bottom of the cars. The stripes continue onto locomotives, with the blue stripe narrowing and curving under the black-painted cab area. Lettering is white and placed in the blue stripe. The Charger locomotives are painted in the same shape as the Northern California units but using the \"Pacific Surfliner\" color scheme. The first two Surfliner Chargers did not match the Surfliner cars. This issue was fixed starting with Charger 2111. Amtrak wrapped F59PHI 457 in a special scheme to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the \"Pacific Surfliner\" and the train's ridership surpassing 25 million. The locomotive's new scheme was released on May 8, 2010, for National Train Day.\nThe \"Cascades\" service uses seven Talgo trainsets, F59PHI and SC-44 Charger locomotives, and ex-F40PH NPCUs painted in a brown, light tan, and dark green scheme - the only revenue equipment not painted in a blue-and-gray-based palette. The five older Talgo VII trainsets have the passenger cars split evenly between tan on top, brown in middle, and dark green on bottom. The transition baggage cars at the end have the green curve above the other colors, where it matches with a green curve on the older locomotives and NPCUs. The scheme was created by industrial designer Cesar Vergara, who also styled the GE Genesis locomotive.\n\nOn the newer SC-44 Charger locomotives, the green stripe is narrower and runs along the top and over the cab. One trainset was originally painted in blue, silver, and white for a Los Angeles-Las Vegas service that was never implemented. In 2016, one NPCU, #90250, was wrapped in Seattle Seahawks livery for several months. The newer Series 8 trainsets are painted similarly to the older sets. One end has a cab car, where the brown and green stripes come to a point, with the top of the cab also painted green.\n\nEMD E8 No. 4316 and coach 1589 were painted for display in New York when Amtrak began service in May 1971; they saw later use on the \"Broadway Limited\". The locomotive was painted black; the Chevron \"pointless arrow\" logo on each side wrapped around the front with blue and white safety stripes.\n\nIn late 2008, Amtrak wrapped F59PHI No. 455 in an Operation Lifesaver paint scheme to promote a Caltrans safety campaign. The wrap featured a surfer with a surfboard standing in the middle of railroad tracks during a sunset. The words \"Stay off, stay away, stay alive\" were printed on both sides. The locomotive was restored to its original livery in 2010. Other locomotives painted for Operation Lifesaver have included F59PHI No. 2007 in a yellow paint scheme with several printed slogans and No. 457 in a blue scheme with a pattern of handprints and the words \"BE TRACK SMART\".\n\nFor Amtrak's 40th anniversary in 2011, four P42DC locomotives received a special version of Phase I through Phase IV paint schemes. From January through April 2011, Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops outside Indianapolis repainted the units and sent them north on the \"Hoosier State\" to Chicago, where they were cycled into regular service on other routes. The Anniversary locomotives were selected from units scheduled for repainting or recent wreck rebuilds. The first repainted locomotive was No. 145 in Phase III paint, which led the \"Capitol Limited\" on January 30, 2011. Three other locomotives followed: Nos. 156 in Phase I, 66 in Phase II, and 184 in Phase IV. P42DC No. 130 was painted in the Phase II livery after No. 66 was damaged beyond repair.\n\nThe 40th Anniversary Exhibit Train consisted of P40DC locomotive No. 822, NPCU No. 406, modified Budd 10-6 heritage sleeper/Crew Dorm No. 10020 \"Pacific Bend\", three heritage baggage cars used as exhibit cars, and reconfigured Amfleet cafe car No. 85999. The whole train was painted in Phase III.\nThe first three ACS-64 units released from Siemens in 2013 received a special variation to the regular Phase V paint scheme. Locomotive Nos. 600 and 601 received a large American flag on the sides as well as smaller logos for Siemens & Amtrak. Locomotive No. 602 had a special \"Reliability - Efficiency - Mobility\" infographic on the sides. All three were later repainted with a conventional Phase V scheme before entering service.\n\nIn June 2013, P42DC #42 was painted in a red, white, black, and dark blue scheme with a large logo on the side saying \"America's Railroad Salutes our Veterans\". A blue band near the wheelbase contains 50 white stars. ACS-64 Nos. 642 and NPCUs Nos. 90208 and 90221 received similar paint schemes in 2015 and 2016.\n\nBeginning in 1976, Amtrak work train equipment was painted safety orange with black undersides. Light grey livery with a red bottom stripe, similar to Phase V non-passenger cars, was introduced for work train cars in 2004. Safety yellow livery was introduced for maintenance of way equipment and roadway vehicles in 2001; it was replaced with a pale lime around 2004, and a brighter lime around 2013. Non-revenue locomotives typically use variations of the Phase paint schemes to make them visually distinct from revenue locomotives while maintaining consistent styles.\n\nIn 1997, Amtrak bought 50 rebuilt boxcars to supplement its newly-built Express Box Car fleet. The rebuilt cars arrived in their original Southern Pacific Olive Green paint scheme, rather than the Phase V scheme of the newer cars, though some were later repainted.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Amtrak has occasionally rented advertising space on the exterior of its passenger equipment. The ads sometimes take the form of wraps rather than true paint schemes. Customers have included fast food restaurants, auto manufacturers, television networks, and politicians. In some cases, the advertisements were on equipment rented for private use, rather than on equipment in normal revenue service. Notable temporary advertisements have included:\n\nAmtrak has tested a number of types of off-the-shelf equipment on the Northeast Corridor and short corridors. Some of these have been painted fully in Amtrak livery:\n\nOther equipment largely retained their paint schemes from usage elsewhere:\n"}
{"id": "2143999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2143999", "title": "DNN (software)", "text": "DNN (software)\n\nDNN (formerly DotNetNuke) is a web content management system and web application framework based on Microsoft .NET. The DNN Platform Edition is open source.\n\nDNN is written in C#, though it existed for many years as a VB.NET project. It is distributed under both a Community Edition MIT license and commercial proprietary licenses as DNN Evoq Content and DNN Evoq Engage editions.\n\nDNN Platform (formerly \"DotNetNuke Community Edition\" content management system) is open source software distributed under an MIT License that is intended to allow management of websites without much technical knowledge, and to be extensible through a large number of third-party apps to provide functionality not included in the DNN core modules. Skins can be used to change the visual appearance of a website using DNN.\n\nThere are two commercial editions of the software with increased functionality (compared to DNN Platform) and technical support. The DotNetNuke Professional Edition was introduced in February 2009 with version 4.9. In July 2013, DotNetNuke Professional Edition was renamed Evoq Content. In addition, DotNetNuke Enterprise Edition was renamed Evoq Content: Enterprise. Evoq version 9.0 was released in December 2016.\n\nDotNetNuke uses a three-tier architecture model with a core framework providing support to the extensible modular structure.\n\nWhile traditionally DNN focused on providing server side functionality, recent projects strive to enhance client side experiences - along with the rest of the industry. In recent years DNN migrated from using exclusively Web Forms to also allowing Model View Controller and Single-page application architectures. In the future, DNN faces the challenge of moving from ASP.NET 4.6 to the cross-platform free and open source .NET Core.\n\nDNN can be extended using 3rd-party modules and providers that add functionality at the server or client side. The appearance of individual pages and sites can be customized using skins.\n\nThe default functionality of DNN can be expanded by adding third-party modules, either from an existing module store, from 3rd party authors, or through in-house development of custom functionality. The DNN framework provides basic functionality such as security, user administration, and content management, while modules are used to tailor the web site for specific deployment needs.\n\nA set of primary modules are included with the core DNN distribution. These modules provide the functionality required to create an e-commerce system, an intranet, a public web site or a custom web application. They are maintained by a volunteer team community. In 2015 and 2016 most projects were moved from the DotNetNuke Community Forge to GitHub.\n\nWeb pages have skins which define regions of a page (plus their appearance) where page editors can place modules (or extensions) made available by site administrators. Pages and modules can inherit or set custom access permissions that define which groups of users can view or edit each item.\n\nModule can be created in various ways: compiled modules use the Web Application Project model and are written in C# or VB.NET, dynamic modules use the Web Site Project model, and Razor modules which use a C# or VB.NET scripting language.\n\nA skinning architecture provides a separation of presentation and content, enabling a web designer to develop skins without requiring any specialist knowledge of development in ASP.NET: only knowledge of HTML and an understanding of how to prepare and package the skins themselves is required. Skins consist of basic HTML files with placeholders (tokens) for content, menus and other functionality, along with support files such as images, style sheets and JavaScript, packaged in a ZIP file.\n\nLike modules, skins, can be uploaded and automatically installed through the administration pages. If the compiled skin does not contain an ASP.NET user control file, then the DNN skinning engine builds one based on various tokens included in the HTML file which refer to various sections, placeholders and/or modules of a DNN-produced page. Modern skins incorporate CSS3 and HTML5 with many authors' skins supporting Responsive web design, various JavaScript libraries. With no credentialing, a skin's quality may vary, but often trial periods are available to evaluate functionality.\n\nDNN 7.0 and above has a minimum requirement of Windows 7, SQL Server 2008, and .NET 4.0 and IIS 7+. These product's latest versions are supported. As of version 6.0, DNN can also be installed in an Azure cloud computing environment. Numerous web hosting companies offer DNN as an offering, and a 1 step installation process is available through Microsoft. However DNN's requirement for an IIS medium trust environment has prevented broader adoption among some mainstream hosting companies.\n\nDNNSoftware.com has over 1 million registered members as of November 2013 and is used on some 750,000 websites globally. Support for the Community Edition of DotNetNuke is provided by community members and developers can participate in the open-source project on GitHub.\n\nAPI reference documents for modules and skins are available, although as of 2013, some documentation was still available only in task-oriented form. A Wiki has been created to address this weakness, with 400 wiki pages as of May 2014.\n\nThe DotNetNuke application originally evolved out of another project, the IBuySpy Portal which was a reference application created in 2001 by Microsoft to showcase the new ASP.NET software development framework. Shaun Walker added significant enhancements to the IBuySpy Portal and released a new version branded as the IBuySpy Workshop on December 24, 2002. The early releases of the IBuySpy Workshop application were developed solely by Walker and distributed by his consulting company, Perpetual Motion Interactive Systems Inc. In March 2003, Shaun Walker announced a rebranding of the open source application to DotNetNuke. The name \"DotNetNuke\" was coined by Walker by combining the term .NET with the word \"nuke\", which had been popular with pre-existing frameworks such as PHP-Nuke and PostNuke. Walker registered trademarks for the terms DotNetNuke and DNN in both the United States and Canada. At this point Walker formed a Core Team of software developers to help him develop and promote new versions of the open source project.\n\nIn September 2006, Shaun Walker invited 3 members of the Core Team, Joe Brinkman, Nik Kalyani, and Scott Willhite, to form DotNetNuke Corporation to oversee management and development of the project, as well as offer professional services to the community.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, DotNetNuke Corporation announced that it had secured Series A financing from Sierra Ventures and August Capital and hired Navin Nagiah as CEO; and in February 2009 it released DotNetNuke Professional Edition, targeted at business and enterprise customers. In February 2010, DotNetNuke closed a round of Series B financing from Sierra Ventures, August Capital, and Pelion Venture Partners.\n\nIn August 2009 DotNetNuke Corporation launched a partnership program aimed at providing support to web design and development companies using DotNetNuke. They also announced the acquisition of Snowcovered, an online market for DotNetNuke modules, skins, services, and related products.\n\nIn October 2009, the Open Source CMS Market Share Report concluded that DotNetNuke was the leading .NET-based open source web content management system.\n\nIn 2013, the company was renamed DNN Corporation and in 2017 the company was acquired by ESW Capital.\n\nDNN provides basic content-management out of the box, but is usually accompanied with one of many (mostly open-source) content management extensions.\n\n\n"}

The event is also referred to as Live 8 London or Live 8 UK.\n\nAll times BST\n\n\nIt had been said that Paul McCartney and U2's Bono would wear Sgt. Pepper costumes during their performance together. However, when the show took place, the costumes were worn by a four-piece French horn section of free-lance London area players, Richard Steggall, Adam Walters, Joe Walters, and Matt Gunner.\n\nImmediately following Travis' performance, Bob Geldof told the audience that he \"couldn't resist playing on this stage\" and played the Boomtown Rats song \"I Don't Like Mondays\". He had earlier said that he did not deserve to play alongside the scheduled acts.\n\nBoth The Cure and Muse were originally listed on the Live 8 website as appearing at the Live 8 London concert. During a BBC TV documentary called The Live 8 Story, the names of both acts are visible on a provisional running order compiled during a production meeting between Geldof, Richard Curtis, Harvey Goldsmith and various other parties. In the end, both acts played the Paris Live 8 concert.\n\nAll the songs performed by Sting were sung twenty years before at Live Aid.\n\nMariah Carey performed a medley of her hits \"Make It Happen\", \"We Belong Together\", and \"Hero\" where she was accompanied by a children’s choir.\n\nSome artists already had shows planned for 2 July which they performed after their performances at Live 8. Accordingly, they were not present for the \"Hey Jude\" grand finale.\n\nThe event marked the first time in 24 years that Pink Floyd's seminal line-up would perform.\n\nOriginally scheduled to close at 21:30 the concert overran and went on until about 00:30, leaving many in the audience with no means of returning home.\n\nAs he had done at Live Aid 20 years previously, Harvey Goldsmith appeared on stage to thank the audience for their patience with the late-running event and to make a closing appeal for people to leave slowly to avoid crushes.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC provided full television coverage, starting on BBC Two from 13:00 and continuing from 18:15 on BBC One, right up to the end of the concert at 00:00. The advertised changeover time was 16:15, disappointing many who had set video recorders accordingly. The coverage was presented by Jonathan Ross, Fearne Cotton, Jo Whiley and Graham Norton. 350 complaints were made to the BBC about swearing before the 21:00 watershed. The BBC apologised, however a spokesman said: \n\nIn Ireland, the concert was broadcast on RTÉ Two, whose coverage ran from 14:00 to 00:00 (except 17:00 to 18:00, when the coverage switched to RTÉ One). The coverage was presented by Dave Fanning and Laura Woods.\n\nIn the United States, MTV and VH1 provided intermittent and incomplete live and taped coverage, frequently breaking away mid-song for commercials or commentary by their VJs. This decision drew criticism from numerous viewers who viewed the commentary as being frivolous or inane and would have preferred to see the music acts themselves. However, AOL provided a full webcast of the entire show.\n\nAfter the criticism from viewers, both VH1 and MTV showed highlights of the Live 8 concerts on 9 July 2005 for 5 hours each without commercial interruption.\n\nIn Australia, the concert was broadcast on FOX8 (live) and the Nine Network (highlights).\n\nIn the UK, there was radio coverage on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 5 Live and several local radio stations.\n\nThe Radio 1 coverage was presented by Chris Moyles, Scott Mills, Edith Bowman, Colin Murray, Sara Cox and Vernon Kay. While the Radio 2 presenters were Chris Evans, Davina McCall and Dermot O'Leary. Each station focussed on artists who matched the station's playlisting policy and target audience. The Radio 5 Live coverage was presented by Brian Alexander, Phil Williams and Aasmah Mir. The coverage also focused on the Make Poverty History march in Edinburgh and the Wimbledon Women's Singles Final.\n\nMost commercial radio stations in the UK took a programme produced by Capital FM for the day, presented by Ulrika Jonsson.\n\nIn the US, XM Satellite Radio broadcast the concert in its entirety.\n\nThe BBC also had live coverage on big screens across the UK.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2144007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144007", "title": "Generalizations of the derivative", "text": "Generalizations of the derivative\n\nIn mathematics, the derivative is a fundamental construction of differential calculus and admits many possible generalizations within the fields of mathematical analysis, combinatorics, algebra, and geometry.\n\nIn real, complex, and functional analysis, derivatives are generalized to functions of several real or complex variables and functions between topological vector spaces. An important case is the variational derivative in the calculus of variations. Repeated application of differentiation leads to derivatives of higher order and differential operators. \n\nThe derivative is often met for the first time as an operation on a single real function of a single real variable. One of the simplest settings for generalizations is to vector valued functions of several variables (most often the domain forms a vector space as well). This is the field of multivariable calculus.\n\nIn one-variable calculus, we say that a function formula_1 is differentiable at a point \"x\" if the limit\nexists. Its value is then the derivative ƒ'(\"x\"). A function is differentiable on an interval if it is differentiable at every point within the interval. Since the line formula_3 is tangent to the original function at the point formula_4 the derivative can be seen as a way to find the \"best linear approximation\" of a function. If one ignores the constant term, setting formula_5, \"L\"(\"z\") becomes an actual linear operator on R considered as a vector space over itself.\n\nThis motivates the following generalization to functions mapping formula_6 to formula_7: ƒ is differentiable at \"x\" if there exists a linear operator \"A\"(\"x\") (depending on \"x\") such that\nAlthough this definition is perhaps not as explicit as the above, if such an operator exists, then it is unique, and in the one-dimensional case coincides with the original definition. (In this case the derivative is represented by a 1-by-1 matrix consisting of the sole entry \"f\"'(\"x\").) Note that, in general, we concern ourselves mostly with functions being differentiable in some open neighbourhood of formula_9 rather than at individual points, as not doing so tends to lead to many pathological counterexamples.\n\nAn \"n\" by \"m\" matrix, of the linear operator \"A\"(\"x\") is known as Jacobian matrix J(ƒ) of the mapping ƒ at point \"x\". Each entry of this matrix represents a partial derivative, specifying the rate of change of one range coordinate with respect to a change in a domain coordinate. Of course, the Jacobian\nmatrix of the composition \"gf\" is a product of corresponding Jacobian matrices: \nJ(\"gf\") =J(\"g\")J(ƒ). This is a higher-dimensional statement of the chain rule.\n\nFor real valued functions from R to R (scalar fields), the total derivative can be interpreted as a vector field called the gradient. An intuitive interpretation of the gradient is that it points \"up\": in other words, it points in the direction of fastest increase of the function. It can be used to calculate directional derivatives of scalar functions or normal directions.\n\nSeveral linear combinations of partial derivatives are especially useful in the context of differential equations defined by a vector valued function R to R. The divergence gives a measure of how much \"source\" or \"sink\" near a point there is. It can be used to calculate flux by divergence theorem. The curl measures how much \"rotation\" a vector field has near a point.\n\nFor vector-valued functions from R to R (i.e., parametric curves), one can take the derivative of each component separately. The resulting derivative is another vector valued function. This is useful, for example, if the vector-valued function is the position vector of a particle through time, then the derivative is the velocity vector of the particle through time.\n\nThe convective derivative takes into account changes due to time dependence and motion through space along vector field.\n\nThe subderivative and subgradient are generalizations of the derivative to convex functions.\n\nOne can iterate the differentiation process, that is, apply derivatives more than once, obtaining derivatives of second and higher order. A more sophisticated idea is to combine several derivatives, possibly of different orders, in one algebraic expression, a differential operator. This is especially useful in considering ordinary linear differential equations with constant coefficients. For example, if \"f\"(\"x\") is a twice differentiable function of one variable, the differential equation\n\nmay be rewritten in the form \n\nis a \"second order linear constant coefficient differential operator\" acting on functions of \"x\". The key idea here is that we consider a particular linear combination of zeroth, first and second order derivatives \"all at once\". This allows us to think of the set of solutions of this differential equation as a \"generalized antiderivative\" of its right hand side 4\"x\" − 1, by analogy with ordinary integration, and formally write \n\nHigher derivatives can also be defined for functions of several variables, studied in multivariable calculus. In this case, instead of repeatedly applying the derivative, one repeatedly applies partial derivatives with respect to different variables. For example, the second order partial derivatives of a scalar function of \"n\" variables can be organized into an \"n\" by \"n\" matrix, the Hessian matrix. One of the subtle points is that the higher derivatives are not intrinsically defined, and depend on the choice of the coordinates in a complicated fashion (in particular, the Hessian matrix of a function is not a tensor). Nevertheless, higher derivatives have important applications to analysis of local extrema of a function at its critical points. For an advanced application of this analysis to topology of manifolds, see Morse theory.\n\nAs in the case of functions of one variable, we can combine first and higher order partial derivatives to arrive at a notion of a partial differential operator. Some of these operators are so important that they have their own names: \n\n\nAnalogous operators can be defined for functions of any number of variables.\n\n\nGiven a function formula_16 which is locally integrable, but not necessarily classically differentiable, a weak derivative may be defined by means of integration by parts. First define test functions, which are infinitely differentiable and compactly supported functions formula_17, and multi-indices, which are length formula_18 lists of integers formula_19 with formula_20. Applied to test functions, formula_21. Then the formula_22 weak derivative of formula_23 exists if there is a function formula_24 such that for \"all\" test functions formula_25, we have \n\nformula_26\n\nIf such a function exists, then formula_27, which is unique almost everywhere. This definition coincides with the classical derivative for functions formula_28, and can be extended to a type of generalized functions called distributions, the dual space of test functions. Weak derivatives are particularly useful in the study of partial differential equations, and within parts of functional analysis.\n\nLaplacians and differential equations can be defined on fractals.\n\nIn addition to \"n\"-th derivatives for any natural number \"n\", there are various ways to define derivatives of fractional or negative orders, which are studied in fractional calculus. The -1 order derivative corresponds to the integral, whence the term differintegral.\n\nIn complex analysis, the central objects of study are holomorphic functions, which are complex-valued functions on the complex numbers satisfying a suitably extended definition of differentiability.\n\nThe Schwarzian derivative describes how a complex function is approximated by a fractional-linear map, in much the same way that a normal derivative describes how a function is approximated by a linear map.\n\nThe Wirtinger derivatives are a set of differential operators that permit the construction of a differential calculus for complex functions that is entirely analogous to the ordinary differential calculus for functions of real variables.\n\nIn quaternionic analysis, derivatives can be defined in a similar way to real and complex functions. Since the quaternions formula_29 are non-commutative, the limit of the difference quotient yield two different derivatives. Left derivative\n\nand right derivative\n\nThe existence of these limits are very restrictive conditions. For example, if formula_32 has left-derivatives at every point on an open connected set formula_33, then formula_34 for formula_35.\n\nIn functional analysis, the functional derivative defines the derivative with respect to a function of a functional on a space of functions. This is an extension of the directional derivative to an infinite dimensional vector space. \n\nThe Fréchet derivative allows the extension of the directional derivative to a general Banach space. The Gateaux derivative extends the concept to locally convex topological vector spaces. Fréchet differentiability is a strictly stronger condition than Gateaux differentiability, even in finite dimensions. Between the two extremes is the quasi-derivative.\n\nIn measure theory, the Radon–Nikodym derivative generalizes the Jacobian, used for changing variables, to measures. It expresses one measure μ in terms of another measure ν (under certain conditions).\n\nIn the theory of abstract Wiener spaces, the \"H\"-derivative defines a derivative in certain directions corresponding to the Cameron-Martin Hilbert space.\n\nOn a function space, the linear operator which assigns to each function its derivative is an example of a differential operator. General differential operators include higher order derivatives. By means of the Fourier transform, pseudo-differential operators can be defined which allow for fractional calculus.\n\nThe Carlitz derivative is an operation similar to usual differentiation have been devised with the usual context of real or complex numbers changed to local fields of positive characteristic in the form of formal Laurent series with coefficients in some finite field F (it is known that any local field of positive characteristic is isomorphic to a Laurent series field).\n\nAlong with suitably defined analogs to the exponential function, logarithms and others the derivative can be used to develop notions of smoothness, analycity, integration, Taylor series as well as a theory of differential equations.\n\n\nFor \"x\" nonzero, if \"f\" is a differentiable function of \"x\" then in the limit as \"q\" → 1 we obtain the ordinary derivative, thus the \"q\"-derivative may be viewed as its q-deformation. A large body of results from ordinary differential calculus, such as binomial formula and Taylor expansion, have natural \"q\"-analogues that were discovered in the 19th century, but remained relatively obscure for a big part of the 20th century, outside of the theory of special functions. The progress of combinatorics and the discovery of quantum groups have changed the situation dramatically, and the popularity of \"q\"-analogues is on the rise.\n\n\n\nThe q-derivative is a special case of Hahn difference (see ),\nHahn difference is not only a generalization of q-derivative but also an extension of forward difference.\n\nIn algebra, generalizations of the derivative can be obtained by imposing the Leibniz rule of differentiation in an algebraic structure, such as a ring or a Lie algebra.\n\nA derivation is a linear map on a ring or algebra which satisfies the Leibniz law (the product rule). Higher derivatives and algebraic differential operators can also be defined. They are studied in a purely algebraic setting in differential Galois theory and the theory of D-modules, but also turn up in many other areas, where they often agree with less algebraic definitions of derivatives.\n\nFor example, the formal derivative of a polynomial over a commutative ring \"R\" is defined by\nThe mapping formula_44 is then a derivation on the polynomial ring \"R\"[\"X\"]. This definition can be extended to rational functions as well.\n\nThe notion of derivation applies to noncommutative as well as commutative rings, and even to non-associative algebraic structures, such as Lie algebras.\n\nSee also Pincherle derivative and Arithmetic derivative.\n\nIn commutative algebra, Kähler differentials are universal derivations of a commutative ring or module. They can be used to define an analogue of exterior derivative from differential geometry that applies to arbitrary algebraic varieties, instead of just smooth manifolds.\n\nIn p-adic analysis, the usual definition of derivative is not quite strong enough, and one requires strict differentiability instead.\n\nAlso see arithmetic derivative and Hasse derivative.\n\nMany abstract data types in mathematics and computer science can be described as the algebra generated by a transformation that maps structures based on the type back into the type. For example, the type T of binary trees containing values of type A can be represented as the algebra generated by the transformation 1+A×T→T. The \"1\" represents the construction of an empty tree, and the second term represents the construction of a tree from a value and two subtrees. The \"+\" indicates that a tree can be constructed either way.\n\nThe derivative of such a type is the type that describes the context of a particular substructure with respect to its next outer containing structure. Put another way, it is the type representing the \"difference\" between the two. In the tree example, the derivative is a type that describes the information needed, given a particular subtree, to construct its parent tree. This information is a tuple that contains a binary indicator of whether the child is on the left or right, the value at the parent, and the sibling subtree. This type can be represented as 2×A×T, which looks very much like the derivative of the transformation that generated the tree type.\n\nThis concept of a derivative of a type has practical applications, such as the zipper technique used in functional programming languages.\n\nMain types of derivatives in geometry is Lie derivatives along a vector field, exterior differential, and covariant derivatives.\n\nIn differential topology, a vector field may be defined as a derivation on the ring of smooth functions on a manifold, and a tangent vector may be defined as a derivation at a point. This allows the abstraction of the notion of a directional derivative of a scalar function to general manifolds. For manifolds that are subsets of R, this tangent vector will agree with the directional derivative defined above.\n\nThe differential or pushforward of a map between manifolds is the induced map between tangent spaces of those maps. It abstracts the Jacobian matrix.\n\nOn the exterior algebra of differential forms over a smooth manifold, the exterior derivative is the unique linear map which satisfies a graded version of the Leibniz law and squares to zero. It is a grade 1 derivation on the exterior algebra.\n\nThe Lie derivative is the rate of change of a vector or tensor field along the flow of another vector field. On vector fields, it is an example of a Lie bracket (vector fields form the Lie algebra of the diffeomorphism group of the manifold). It is a grade 0 derivation on the algebra.\n\nTogether with the interior product (a degree -1 derivation on the exterior algebra defined by contraction with a vector field), the exterior derivative and the Lie derivative form a Lie superalgebra.\n\nIn differential geometry, the covariant derivative makes a choice for taking directional derivatives of vector fields along curves. This extends the directional derivative of scalar functions to sections of vector bundles or principal bundles. In Riemannian geometry, the existence of a metric chooses a unique preferred torsion-free covariant derivative, known as the Levi-Civita connection. See also gauge covariant derivative for a treatment oriented to physics.\n\nThe exterior covariant derivative extends the exterior derivative to vector valued forms.\n\nIn geometric calculus, the geometric derivative satisfies a weaker form of the Leibniz rule. It specializes the Frechet derivative to the objects of geometric algebra. Geometric calculus is a powerful formalism that has been shown to encompass the similar frameworks of differential forms and differential geometry.\n\nIt may be possible to combine two or more of the above different notions of extension or abstraction of the original derivative. For example, in Finsler geometry, one studies spaces which look locally like Banach spaces. Thus one might want a derivative with some of the features of a functional derivative and the covariant derivative.\n\nThe study of stochastic processes requires a form of calculus known as the Malliavin calculus. One notion of derivative in this setting is the \"H\"-derivative of a function on an abstract Wiener space.\n\nMultiplicative calculus replaces addition with multiplication, and hence rather than dealing with the limit of a ratio of differences, it deals with the limit of an exponentiation of ratios. This allows the development of the geometric derivative and bigeometric derivative. Moreover, just like the classical differential operator has a discrete analog, the difference operator, there are also discrete analogs of these multiplicative derivatives.\n\n"}

In the modern day, there are over 250 variations in spelling of the name Ó Dochartaigh, of which Doherty (with or without the \"Ó\") is the most common anglicisation.\n\nThe O’Dohertys are named after Dochartach (fl. 10th century), a member of the Cenél Conaill dynasty which in medieval Irish genealogy traced itself to Niall of the Nine Hostages (see Uí Néill).\n\nThe O’Doherty clan and family name is one of the most ancient in Europe. The clan traces its pedigree through history, pre-history and mythology to the second millennium BC. Their story was transmitted orally for thousands of years and was first put in writing by Christian monks between the 6th and 11th centuries AD. The principal written sources are manuscripts, genealogies, king-lists, chronologies and poems including:\n\n\nAccording to these sources, the O’Dohertys are descended from Breogán, the famous Celtic King of Galicia in Spain in the second millennium BC. His grandson Galam, famously known as Míl Espáine (Irish: Soldier of Spain) a.k.a. Milesius, gave his name to the Milesians who are said to have been the first Celtic (or Gaelic) peoples of Ireland). Breogan's great-grandson Érimón was one of the Celtic chieftains who conquered Ireland from the pre-Celtic neolithic Tuatha Dé Danann (Irish: \"People of the Goddess Danu\"), and was the first Milesian King of Ireland.  \n\nÉrimón was King of Ireland from c.1700 – 1684 BC according to the Annals of the Four Masters, although the Foras Feasa ar Éirinn calculates his reign from 1287-1272 BC. \n\nThe O’Doherty clan traces its descent from Erimon through some 150 generations of his descendants including 54 kings and 26 princes. Notable among Erimon’s descendants are:\n\nEochu Feidlech a.k.a. \"Eochaid\" (i.e. the enduring) was High King of Ireland in the 4th century BC and the father of Queen Medb or Maeve the great warrior Queen of Connacht who started the famous \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\" (English: Cattle Raid of Cooley) to steal Ulster’s prize stud bull, opposed by the teenage Ulster hero Cú Chulainn.\n\nTúathal Techtmar (1st century BC), high King of Ireland and ancestor of the historic O’Neill and Connachta dynasties.\n\nConn of the Hundred Battles (Irish: \"Conn Cétchathach\"), High King of Ireland in the 2nd century AD. He was the ancestor of the Connachta and, through his descendant Niall Noígiallach, the Uí Néill dynasties, which dominated Ireland in the early Middle Ages. Conn appointed the legendary hero Finn MacCool (Irish: \"Fionn mac Cumhaill\") the last leader of the Fianna, the small, semi-independent warrior bands in Irish mythology.  \n\nNiall of the Nine Hostages (Irish: \"Niall Noígíallach\"), King of the Northern half if Ireland from c.368–395 AD  The O’Neill dynasty which he founded were High Kings of Ireland for 400 years, and ruled their own Kingdom of Aileach for 8 centuries from 465-1283. His grandson Saint Columba (Irish: \"Colum Cillle\") (7 December 521 – 9 June 597) introduced Christianity to what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important Abbey of Iona on the Scottish island of the same name, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. The O’Neill dynasty includes the O’Donnell Kings, Princes and Lords of Tyrconnell, and the O’Doherty Princes or Lords of Inishowen in County Donegal. These titles were given through the traditional proto-democratic system of election by tanistry (the form of elective monarchy based on patrilineal relationship that characterised the succession of the ancient Gaelic clans under Brehon law. However, after the Anglo-Norman and English conquests of Ireland, the aristocratic titles of Irish Kings and clan chieftains were designated by the foreign system of primogeniture through which the first-born \"legitimate\" son would automatically inherit his father’s title and or property (which transmitting and concentrating power and wealth to men with no regard of their merit or ability).\n\nKing Conall Gulban (died c. 464 AD) was the son of Niall Naoigiallach. He is the eponymous ancestor of the Cenél Conaill, and founded and gave his name to the kingdom of Tír Chonaill, comprising much of what is now County Donegal in Ulster. He is important in the history of Irish Christianity as he was the first Gaelic nobleman baptised by St. Patrick, thus opening the way for the conversion of the nobility in Ireland. The Kingdom of Tyrconnell was part of the Kingdom of Aileach until 1185 AD.\n\nDonagh Dochartach, who lived in the 9th century AD, gave his name to the O'Doherty family. The later chiefs of the clan, elected by tanistry under the Brehon Laws, became the Lords of Inishowen after migrating from their original territory in the Laggan valley area of present-day Donegal, into the vacuum left by the end of Meic Lochlainn rule in Inishowen, the northernmost peninsula of the island of Ireland.\n\nConor-an-Einigh O Dochartaigh (1359-1413) was the first of the clan to settle in Inishowen, namely at Castleross in the parish of Desertegney (Irish: \"Díseart Einigh\", i.e. the refuge or hiding place of Einigh) which is named after him. Other members of the clan subsequently born in Desertagny include a brother of the rebel Sir Cahir O’Doherty (1587-1608) and the ancestors of the politician Joseph O’Doherty who lived a few miles further south in the same parish at Gortyarrigan.\n\nSeán More O Dochartaigh (Abt. 1505 -26 May 1582 or 1566?) had castles at Aileach, Inch and Burt. The O’Doherty’s were called the ‘Lords of Inishowen’. An agreement was reached in abt. 1540 that O’Dochartaigh would not cross the River Foyle if the British would stay out of Inishowen. In doing this under the process called Surrender and Regrant, Seán Mor O’Dochartaigh bent the knee before the English King Henry VIII in 1541 and became Sir John O’Doherty. This strategy essentially sought to assimilate the Gaelic leadership into the new Tudor Kingdom of Ireland and the Anglican Church.\n\nSir John Og O’Doherty (Abt. 1540- 1601, Lord in 1582). Son of Seán Mor O’Doherty and Rosa O’Donnell. Lived at Burt Castle. In 1600 he protected Inishowen against an invasion by the English fleet which had set up three forts around Lough Foyle, one of which was built on the O’Dogherty estate at Culmore. Later in 1600, he slew Colonel Sir John Chamberlain and many members of the English army who had marched against him. John Og was slain on 27 January 1601. \"There was not a lord of a barony amongst the Irish more distinguished for manual action and hospitality, or more bold in counsel than he.\"\n\nRosa O’Doherty (Irish: \"Róisín Ní Dhochartaigh\") (c.1588–1660) was the daughter of Sir John O’Doherty and the younger sister of Sir Cahir O’Doherty. Rosa was first married to Cathbarr O’Donnell, the younger brother of Rory O’Donnell, the last King of Tyrconnell and then 1st Earl of Tyrconnell. Cathbarr, Rosa and her infant son Hugh accompanied Rory to Continental Europe during the 1607 Flight of the Earls, which signalled the end of the ancient Gaelic nobility in Ireland. They embarked on a French ship from Rathmullan on the shore of Lough Swilly heading for La Coruña in Spain on 14 September with the Earls O’Neill and O’Donnell along with a great number of the nobles of the province of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters described the event as follows: \"That was a distinguished company for one ship, for it is most certain that the sea has not borne nor the wind wafted from Ireland in the latter times a party in any one ship more eminent, illustrious, and noble than they were, in point of geneaology, or more distinguished for great deeds, renown, feats of arms, and valorous achievements; and would that God had granted them to remain in their patrimonies, until their youths should arrive at the age of manhood! Woe to the heart that meditated! Woe to the mind that planned! Woe to the Council that determined on the project which caused the party who went on that voyage to depart, while they had no prospect to the end of their lives of returning safe to their hereditary estates or patrimonial inheritance.\" Rosa's husband Cathbarr O’Donnell died of fever in Italy the following year, leaving Rosa widow at the age of twenty. In 1613–14 she married Owen Roe O’Neill, an Irish officer serving in the Spanish army whom she met in Flanders. His great-grandfather was Conn O’Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone, the most powerful figure in Ulster and the first Ó Néill to take a title from the Crown as part of the surrender and regrant policy.  At the peak of his lengthy reign, he was the most powerful Irish king. He was known throughout Europe as a strong and able leader, a hearty warrior, and looked to by the Catholic world as a bastion of strength against the English crown, despite his conversion to the Protestant faith. In 1642 Rosa returned to Ireland when Owen Roe came back to serve the Irish Confederacy during the War of Three Kingdoms. She landed at Wexford in the company of Colonel Richard O’Farrell with supplies and reinforcements for her husband’s Ulster Army. Owen Roe became a leading figure of the Irish Confederacy, enjoying mixed fortunes but winning a notable success against Scottish forces at the Battle of Benburb in 1646. Following the Irish Rebellion of 1641, O’Neill returned and took command of the Ulster Army of the Irish Confederates. Owen Roe O’Neill died of natural causes at Cloughoughter Castle in Cavan November 1649. Rosa had been in Galway and arrived a few days after her husband’s death. She went to Flanders following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, living in Brussels until her death in 1660. She was buried near the altar of the Franciscan College of St. Anthony of Padua in Louvain. The Latin inscription on the stone slab that covers her grave (here translated into English) reads as follows: \"To the Greater Glory of God —Here lies awaiting the Resurrection D.O.M. The Most Excellent Lady Rosa O’Docharty, Daughter and Sister of Chiefs of Inishowen. The honour of her exalted race; illustrious by character and by her splendid alliances. She was first married to that eminent man, her kinsman Lord Cathbar O’Donnell, Chief of Tirconnell. Subsequently she married, His Excellency Lord Eugene O’Neill, Commander-in-Chief of the Catholic Army in Ulster. She experienced good and evil fortune, And strove through her beneficience to become worth of Heaven. She was more than seventy years when she died in Brussels, 1st November A.D. 1670. This monument was erected by her first-born son Hugh O’Donnell. Here, her body awaits the resurrection.\"\n\nSir Cahir O'Doherty (1587–1608) was the last Gaelic Lord of Inishowen.  Following the Flight of the Earls in 1607, he rebelled against English domination in Ireland and the plantation of Protestant settlers in what is known as O'Doherty's Rebellion. Provoked by the English Governor George Paulet, Cahir and his followers attacked and destroyed Derry and burned several castles in Strabane and Lifford in 1608. However, the King’s Marshal Richard Wingfield (1st Viscount Powerscourt) recovered the city in a counter-attack and on 5 July 1608, Sir Cahir was killed at the Rock of Doon during the Battle of Kilmacrennan on 5 July 1608. The remaining rebels were then crushed by Sir Arthur Chichester who received the Lordship of Inishowen for himself, together with a grant of O’Doherty’s entire 170,000 acres of land in Inishowen.\n\nAfter this loss the O'Doherty family lost much of its power and influence. By 1784, the leading branch of the family (i.e. with titles recognised according to the English system of primogeniture) fled the country and has not returned since.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Irish government offered some limited recognition to the Chiefs of the most ancient clans \"as recognised under the English system of primogeniture\", rather than the original Irish tradition of tanistry, calling them the Chiefs of the Name. The chieftainship of the Dohertys was thus claimed by the late Dr. Ramón O'Dogherty of Spain and was celebrated by an inauguration ceremony during the 1990 O'Dochartaigh Clan Reunion. However, after Terence MacCarthy claimed and was recognised as chief of the MacCarthy clan under the tanistry system, this created a scandal which threw the status of the \"chiefs of the name\" into question, including that of Ramon O'Doherty in Spain.\n\nToday there are Doherty families in many parts of Ireland, with primary concentration in their homeland of the Inishowen Peninsula, Co. Donegal and the vicinity of Derry. The O’Dohertys are an important part of the Irish diaspora. To this end, the family continues through voluntary organisations, exploring family and Irish history and hosting regular family reunions.\n\nThe Ó Dochartaigh Clann Association was formed in the 1980s by a collaboration of American and Canadian clanfolk with its base in Michigan. It operated from Inch Island, Co, Donegal from 1985 until 1999, and from Buncrana from 1999 until 2007. The association is now based in Michigan again, offering international membership and a newsletter.\n\nÓ Doherty reunions have been hosted in Ireland every five years since 1985, by the Ó Dochartaigh Irish Reunion Committee (an amalgamation of the reunion committees from Inishowen and Derry). A special reunion was held in July 2008, commemorating the 1608 death of Cahir Ó Doherty. The next reunion is scheduled for 23-28 July 2020. In 2005 the reunion hosted the film premiere of \"Roots of a Man\" – \"A Journey Through The Land of the Clan O'Doherty\".\n\nThe O’Dohertys built or occupied numerous castles to defend their territory of Inishowen against Viking, Saxon, Anglo-Norman and English invaders. These included:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2144039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2144039", "title": "Highpointing", "text": "Highpointing\n\nHighpointing is the sport of ascending to the point with the highest elevation within a given area (the \"highpoint\"). Examples include: climbing the highest point of each U.S. state; reaching the highest point of each county within a specific state; and ascending the highest mountain on each continent (the \"Seven Summits\").\n\nWhile highpointing takes its adherents to the apex of dangerous and spectacular mountains, it also leads people to climb much less notable hilltops in pursuit of their goal. An example of this can be found in those who climb the highest point of each U.S. state. This requires ascents not only of Denali and Mt. Rainier, two of North America’s most impressive peaks, but also to the tops of such states as Delaware and Rhode Island, where most people would contend there are no actual mountains to climb. The heterogeneous nature of these summits is usually considered part of the appeal, as the travel and cultural experiences en route to the climbs are often valued as highly as the climbs themselves.\nThis sport is practiced all around the world, though it seems the most popular in the United States. The most prominent groups of \"highpointers\" in the U.S. attempt to either climb to the highest point of each state in the U.S. or to the highest point in each county within a specific U.S. state. These activities are called \"state\" and \"county\" highpointing, respectively.\n\nOther notable highpointing pursuits include climbing the Seven Summits, ascending to the highest mountain in each country in Europe, and reaching the top of each state or province in one’s home country.\n\nHighpointing is related to, but different than peakbagging. Peakbaggers usually climb every peak above a certain height in a specific region (like the Munros or the Colorado Fourteeners), whereas highpointers would climb just one summit in each region of a larger geographical area.\n\nThe goal of many highpointers is to ascend to every highpoint on their list; however, many others undertake highpointing for the experience of climbing as many highpoints as they find enjoyable, with no expectation of doing them all.\n\nStarting in the early 20th century, a few pioneers of highpointing began visiting the highest geographic point in each of the 50 states of the United States. In the early days, this endeavor involved dispute and original research, as the tools to precisely map every square inch of the country were just beginning to find widespread use - and this was part of the charm.\n\nThe first person to successfully climb each U.S. state highpoint was A.H. Marshall, who completed the task in July, 1936, when there were only 48 states. Marshall's 48th highpoint to complete the task was Indiana's modest Hoosier Hill. \nOnly four individuals are known to have completed all 48 states before the addition of Alaska and Hawaii in 1959.\n\nThe first person to climb to the top of all 50 U.S. states was Vin Hoeman in 1966. Since then, about 250 people have successfully climbed to the top of each U.S. state. Mt. Everest, by comparison, has seen over 5,000 ascents by more than 3,000 individuals.\n\nIn 1986, Jack Longacre placed an ad in Outside magazine which led the next year to the formation of the Highpointers Club , which is devoted to climbs of U.S. state highpoints.\n\nParticipation in county highpointing in the U.S. varies widely among states, with few states being climbed by more than a few dozen individuals. See County Highpointers Club for more information.\n\nThe Seven Summits including Mount Kosciusko was first completed in 1985 by Dick Bass. At least 350 people have climbed all seven since then. There is some dispute over what constitutes Australia's summit: some people climb Mount Kosciuszko, the highest point on the Australian mainland; others climb the more demanding Puncak Jaya, highest point of the Australian continental shelf. In 1986, Canadian Patrick Morrow became the first to complete the Seven Summits with Puncak Jaya. In 1996, Californian David D. Keaton became the first person to complete both versions of the Seven Summits as well as the 50 U.S. state highpoints.\n\nThe first person to climb all of Europe's highpoints was Ginge Fullen in 1999. There were a few revisions of the high points in Europe e.g. Kosovo - Morgan Batt is the first to summit the revised list 2017. Mr. Fullen also appears to be the first person to climb the highpoint of every nation in Africa. Since then, a few dozen people have also completed the European highpoints. European highpoint climbers have their task complicated by 1) various definitions of what constitutes the European continent 2) emergence of new nations 3) debate over whether to count the highest points on the mainland of a nation, or the highpoints of islands belonging to it.\n\nClimbs to the tops of each state/province in Canada, Australia, and other countries have also been recorded.\n\nTo date, no person is known to have reached the highest point in every country in the world. The highest point of Bhutan (Gangkhar Puensum) is closed to the public, and is probably the world's highest unclimbed mountain.\n\nRules for this pursuit are few, and ascents are generally defined by the individuals themselves. Highpointing has no formal governing body. The organizational body for state highpointing in the U.S. is The Highpointers Club. However, many Highpoint Guides and Books hold to these general principles:\n\n\n\"See also: List of U.S. states and territories by elevation\"\nThe two most prolific highpointing organizations are The Highpointers Club, whose members aspire to reaching all of the U.S. state highpoints, and the County Highpointers Club, whose members are collectively attempting to reach the highest point in the 3,142 U.S. counties located in the 50 states and District of Columbia. (The County Highpointers Club is not attempting to reach the highest points of the 100 county-equivalents in the U.S. territories).\nU.S. state highpointers generally consider the recognized highpoints of the 50 U.S. states, but may also include the highpoints of the District of Columbia and the 5 major U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Because of the difficulty of climbing Alaska's Denali, many people only attempt to reach the highpoints of the 48 contiguous states.\n\nIn addition to reaching the highest point in each of the 50 U.S. states, some highpointers also ascend Fort Reno Park, the highest point in the District of Columbia, and/or Cerro de Punta, the highest mountain in Puerto Rico. Some also climb the highpoints of other U.S. territories like Mount Lamlam in Guam and Lata Mountain in American Samoa.\n\nElevations range from 20,310 feet on Alaska's Denali to 345 feet on Florida's Britton Hill. Technically, the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands has the lowest elevation, with the highest elevation being 279 feet (85 meters) on Navassa Island. See List of U.S. states and territories by elevation for more information.\nDifficulty of ascent varies considerably from state to state (or territory). About 20 of the states can be ascended by automobile. Many of the rest can be reached via an easy hike. Only 10 to 20 require serious effort, depending on an individual's fitness and skills. Denali is by far the most difficult, requiring serious training, thousands of dollars, about three weeks, and favorable weather conditions to summit. See and for more information on the relative difficulty of the various ascents.\n\nWhile most highpointers view highpointing as a hobby it is also seen a sport by many in the mountaineering community. In 1991 a team consisting of Pete Allard, Jim Grace, Shaun Lacher, David Sandway and Dennis Stewart, who called themselves \"The Highpoint Hoppers,\" set the first recognized record for climbing the highest point in each of the lower contiguous states in the fastest time. The team began on the summit of Mount Rainier in Washington at midnight on July 1 and finished on the summit of Gannett Peak in Wyoming on July 31 thus completing their goal of ascending all 48 state highpoints in one calendar month. Their time was 30 days, 10 hours and 52 minutes. For their effort, the Highpoint Hoppers got recognition in Guinness Book of World Records. Fifteen years later, British climber Jake Meyer broke the speed record for climbing the lower 48 highpoints in 23 days, 19 hours and 31 minutes in 2006. The record stood until American siblings Josh and Lindsay Sanders broke the record in 19 days, 7 hours and 37 minutes in 2015\n\nCounty highpointing, unlike state highpointing, is most popular in the British Isles. There are several guides covering ascents of the counties of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.\n\nThere are 48 counties in England, 33 in Scotland, 32 in Ireland, and 22 in Wales. Most of these \"county tops\" outside Scotland are non-technical walk-ups. Each nation in the British Isles has seen dozens of people complete their lists. Climbers have been confused in recent years by status changes in the various counties, both adding and subtracting highpoints, depending upon the criteria used.\n\nBy contrast, in the United States, there are 3,242 counties, and no one has yet approached climbing all of them. Bob Packard is currently listed as the person with the most county highpoints completed, having ascended to the tops of all the counties of 29 states. Because of the large number of counties in the U.S., most county highpointers narrow the list by aspiring to climb only a certain subset of county highpoints. For instance, many county highpointers only ascend the highpoints of single (or perhaps maybe a few) states. Others may climb only the highest, most prominent, or most difficult county high points.\n\nRhode Island, a low state with a handful of counties, has seen the most people climb all its counties, with 40 people listed. Several U.S. states and territories have not yet seen ascents of all their counties.\n\nThe U.S. county highpointers' club rules, as described here, are slightly stricter than state highpoint rules.\n\nMany counties, especially flat and low-lying ones, have not been fully surveyed and thus have no single defined highest point, just multiple areas with the same highest contour line. In order to claim to have successfully climbed the county's highest point, then, it is necessary to visit all those areas, unless one can clearly be ruled out by line of sight from another one or by virtue of having been graded or excavated. Even if one area has an elevation indicated on the USGS map, the county highpointer must visit other areas within the same contour until and unless the maximum elevations are resolved by an official survey.\nFor flat counties with multiple points, county highpointing is more akin to geocaching than peak bagging, since logically only one of the points is the highpoint, and the rest are not. In this case the number of virtual 'caches' is largely an artifact of the size of the contour interval (for a given area, the larger the contour interval, the more 'possible' highpoints there will be). For instance suppose the two highest points in a county are 101 feet and 106 feet above sea level, and that neither has a spot elevation on the map. If the region is mapped with 5-foot contours, there will be only 1 \"highpoint\". However, if the region is mapped with 10-foot contours, there will be two \"highpoints\", and county highpointers will be required to visit both points to claim the county.\n\n"}

Presenters stated several times on stage that over one million people were at the concert.\nNon-organizer estimates ranged from 600,000 to 800,000 and one million to 1.5 million. Some estimates are of the number of people at the concert at any one time, while other estimates are of the total number of people on the Parkway over the course of the nearly 8 hour-long event.\n\nAll times EDT\nSeveral artists mentioned or dedicated performances to Luther Vandross who had died the day before.\n\nThe show managed to expose fault in the SEPTA Regional Rail system, which is the commuter rail portion of the city's mass transit system, SEPTA. Trains to and from the concert were overcrowded and many had to ignore departure times in order to accommodate the unprecedented influx of passengers using the system at one time.\n\nTwo days after the concert, Elton John gave a free concert on the same stage used for Live 8, as part of the city's Independence Day celebrations.\n\nLive 8 producer/promoter Russell Simmons was the man responsible for adding more African American artists to the Live 8 Philadelphia bill, including some Def Poetry Jam poets.\n\nAfter noticing the lack of hip-hop artists on the bill, Bono called Jay-Z and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park personally and asked them to perform in Philadelphia. 50 Cent, Justin Timberlake, Usher, and Sean Combs were also originally scheduled to perform but cancelled due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nDespite suspicions that the show's finale would consist of a new rendition of the USA for Africa hit \"We Are the World\", which was performed at the Philadelphia show twenty years ago at Live Aid, it did not.\n\nAlso, rumors circulated in the crowd that Bruce Springsteen would close the show.\n\nIn the United States, MTV and VH1 provided intermittent and incomplete live and taped coverage, frequently breaking away mid-song for commercials or commentary by their veejays. ABC provided a short highlights program that evening.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, BBC One aired highlights after the full coverage of the London show. Furthermore, BBC Three aired further highlights the following evening. Clair Brothers Audio Systems and Franklin Simon Productions were responsible for providing the live sound reinforcement for Live 8 Philadelphia. Electric Factory Concerts was also involved in the production. Clair Brothers also provided the live sound reinforcement for Live 8 London.

The theater was named in honor of the original Ziegfeld Theatre (1927–1966) which was built by the impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr..\n\nOn December 17, 1969, a few hundred feet from the site of the original Ziegfeld Theatre, a new Ziegfeld opened as a single-screen movie house with the New York premiere of \"Marooned\". It was the flagship of the Walter Reade movie theatre chain.\n\nConstructed by Emery Roth & Sons from designs by Irving Gershon it was built on part of the old theatre and was the first new theatre in the Times Square area since Radio City Music Hall was built in 1932. It was one of the last large-scale, single-screen movie palaces built in the United States. The gold and maroon interior was designed by John J. McNamara at a cost of $600,000. \n\nThe theatre had 1,152 seats (825 seats in the orchestra section and 306 seats in the tiered rear section).
