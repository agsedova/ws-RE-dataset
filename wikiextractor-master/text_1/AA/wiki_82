The Sleeman Centre has hosted concerts, sporting and family events as well as trade shows and conferences. It is home to the Guelph Storm of the major junior Ontario Hockey League. The arena hosted the 2002 Memorial Cup and the 2008 Founders Cup tournament.\n\nThe \"Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre\" was built in 2000 at a cost of $21 million. A new arena for Guelph had been in discussion for well over a decade by Guelph City Council. The owners of the Guelph Platers, the OHL team at Guelph Memorial Gardens at the time, moved to Owen Sound in 1989 with one of the stated reasons was the lack of a new arena. Serious talks of a new arena for the Guelph Storm, which moved from Hamilton in 1991 and played out of the cramped Guelph Memorial Gardens, did not get started until the mid to late 1990s after the Guelph Storm's failed attempt to host the Memorial Cup.\n\nFinding a suitable location, as well as the cost, was debated for many years. Many sites had been looked at including the Memorial Gardens site, the Fountain Street parking lot, and in the west end of the city where there was plans to build a new recreation and community complex. When the Eaton's store at the Guelph Eaton Centre closed down, the city investigated the potential of building an arena where the now empty store stood. To acquire the property, the city had to purchase the mall from ING Barings for $1.7 million. The 5,000-seat arena was then built on the site of the former Eaton's store after the purchase of the mall in 1998 and demolition of the back section where the Eaton's store once stood.\n\nThe city entered a public–private partnership agreement with Nustadia in 1998 to build and operate the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre for 30 years. The city contributed half of the cost of the project and also guaranteed a $9-million loan for capital costs, which was to be paid back by Nustadia. However, in 2001, the city of Guelph had to take over the $10 million \"senior\" loan for the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre, plus the $9.5 million \"subordinated\" loan the city was already paying due to Nustadia failing to make a June 1 quarterly payment of $181,250. The city had to pay $3 million over the a four-year span to make Nustadia's payments on its bank loan for the downtown arena. Nustadia stated that difficulties in making payments were attributed to a number of factors, including the failure to generate anticipated restaurant and food court revenue and lower-than-projected ticket sales from Guelph Storm hockey games. Nustadia expected 3,500 people per game but the average was closer to 2,800 in 2000–01. A four-year reprieve was granted by Guelph City Council so that Nustadia could operate under ideal conditions. Nustadia was to repay the money but with a clause in the agreement between the city and the developer giving either side the ability to walk away with no financial obligations to the other. That deal expired on June 30, 2005.\n\nIn 2005, after the four year reprieve, the city took over ownership of the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre because Nustadia Developments Inc. decided to walk away from the downtown facility, completing a controversial transaction that had been expected for a few months. The deal at the time transferred the ownership from Guelph Centre Partners, a division of Nustadia that was managing the arena, to the city, and left the City of Guelph with nearly $4 million in unanticipated debt plus the $9-million loan previously guaranteed by the city. In 2009, the City of Guelph announced plans to upgrade the Sleeman Centre starting spring 2010. This upgrade consisted of adding a video score clock to the arena that has four video replay screens as well as two LED rings at the top and bottom of the scoreboard.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2018, Guelph's junior B team, the Guelph Hurricanes (formerly known as the Guelph Dominators) moved to the Sleeman Centre for their regular season home games. The team moved back to Cambridge, Ontario, as the Cambridge Redhawks in 2018.\n\nIn June 2007, Sleeman Breweries and the City of Guelph finalized a $1.2 million sponsorship deal that gives the beer company exclusive naming rights to the Guelph Sports & Entertainment Centre until 2020.\n\nIn the main arena the seats are blue, with private suites located one level above the main seating area. The club seats are behind the player benches. There is also a restaurant behind the club seats as well as a 200 level VIP section on the same level of the private boxes. The arena has a standard four-sided scoreboard, which is blue to go with the arena theme colour. The concourse is wide and horseshoe shaped, as fans have to either exit to Old Quebec Street food court or go through the restaurant. Fans can walk all the way around the arena with uninterrupted views of the action on the ice.\n\n"}

It is the oldest (informal) era of the Hadean eon, and it is commonly accepted to have begun close to 4533 million (about 4.533 billion) years ago when the Earth and Moon formed. No samples exist to date the transition between the Cryptic era and the following Basin Groups era for the Moon (see also Pre-Nectarian), though sometimes it is stated that this era ended 4150 million years ago for one or both of these bodies. Neither this time period, nor any other Hadean subdivision, has been officially recognized by the International Commission on Stratigraphy.\n\nThis time is cryptic because very little geological evidence has survived from this time. Most geological landforms and rocks were probably destroyed in the early bombardment phase, or by the continued effects of plate tectonics. The Earth accreted, its interior differentiated and its molten surface solidified during the Cryptic era. The proposed collision that led to the formation of the Moon occurred also at this time. The oldest known minerals are from the Cryptic era.\n\n\n"}

It operated from 1964 to 2006, and was primarily used as an ice hockey venue for the Oshawa Generals. The auditorium was built as a replacement to the Hambly Arena, which burned down in 1953. The auditorium was part of a larger multi-purpose recreational complex.\n\nThe construction of the auditorium was led by a committee of residents with the slogan: \"Let's build it ourselves, for ourselves.\" Volunteers raised $1.4 million from the community to fund the project, including $476,000 from the local General Motors employees union (Canadian Auto Workers) through payroll reductions. The City of Oshawa provided 20 acres of land on Thornton Road South, previously designated for a cemetery. Groundbreaking for the project took place on February 28, 1964, and the formal opening took place on December 11, 1964. The auditorium capacity was 3,625 seated, and 4,025 including standing room.\n\nThe Oshawa Generals began play at the auditorium on December 15, 1964, and won 6–4 over the St. Catharines Black Hawks. While playing at the auditorium, the Generals won five J. Ross Robertson Cups, and the 1990 Memorial Cup. The Oshawa Generals hosted the 1987 Memorial Cup tournament at the auditorium. The Generals played their final at the auditorium on October 29, 2006, and won 8–6 over the Kingston Frontenacs. The Oshawa Legionaires won three regular season Metro Junior B League titles playing at the auditorium. The Oshawa Green Gaels moved into the auditorium partway through their seven consecutive Minto Cups from 1963 to 1969.\n\nThe auditorium hosted the inaugural Wrigley Cup in 1974, a national midget hockey tournament for the top 12 teams in the country set up by Jack Devine and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. On April 22, 1979, the auditorium hosted two benefit concerts for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind by the Rolling Stones, after Keith Richards was charged with possession of heroin. The auditorium became home to the Oshawa Sports Hall of Fame on May 21, 1986. The auditorium became home to the world's longest hockey stick in 2003. In May 2006, Alice Cooper was one of the final concerts at the auditorium.\n\nIn June 2005, construction began on a replacement arena in downtown Oshawa. The General Motors Centre opened as the city's new primary hockey venue in October 2006. The auditorium sat idle until demolition between April and July 2010. The former site of the auditorium became an indoor turf field.\n\n"}

{"id": "1890167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890167", "title": "Sault Memorial Gardens", "text": "Sault Memorial Gardens\n\nThe Sault Memorial Gardens was the focal point of ice hockey in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, for 57 years from 1949 to 2006. It was located in the heart of the downtown district at 169 Queen Street. The Gardens was one of the first Northern Ontario arenas to have artificial ice, and seated 3,990 spectators.\n\nThe arena was built as a war memorial, and hosted several teams over the years, but was primarily home to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League. The Memorial Gardens was ultimately replaced by the Steelback Centre, built directly adjacent to where the Gardens once stood.\n\nOn January 7, 1946, the City of Sault Ste. Marie voted to construct a new recreational facility with an arena. It was approved by city residents via questionnaire to replace the then existing Gouin Street Arena. Plans originally intended the facility to be multi-purpose, including an indoor pool, auditorium, and large outdoor fountains. Cost estimates at the outlook of the project were in the range of $400,000 CAD.\n\nThe official groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 18, 1946. Work on the massive structure would take two and a half years to complete. Once completed, total costs were approximately $765,000 CAD. The Memorial Gardens officially opened February 20, 1949, with a crowd of 8,500 to mark the official dedication.\n\nThe design of the Gardens' front facade was representative of Streamline Moderne architecture style, using straight lines and curved forms. The main entrance and lobby were on the first floor at street level, and the Greyhounds team offices were on the second floor above. Inside the front doors, the lobby featured cast iron gates through which spectators filed to have their tickets taken. Inside these gates were concessions and entrances to the seating areas.\n\nThe seating area had main concourse around the top of arena, and an aisle around the boards at ice level for movement of spectators. The benches for hockey teams, and penalty boxes were located in these aisles. The seats were all wooden benches, painted light blue.\n\nThe Gardens had more rows of seats at the ends of the arena, than along the sides. The concourse and seats along the sides, sloped downwards from the end sections, towards the middle sections. As a result of this there were four full sections in the Gardens in which every single seat was tilted on a diagonal angle. The upper concourse area was very narrow, along the sides, and it was also the standing room area.\n\nThe Gardens' most distinctive feature was the Memorial Tower and red-lighted beacon. The beacon was lit on nights the Greyhounds played home games. The tower was also in commemoration of soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during World War II. At the base of the tower, inside the building, stands a list among wreaths, bearing the names of those of Sault Ste. Marie's bravest who did not return. The tower is all that remains from the demolished structure of the Gardens.\n\nInside the Gardens, high above the ice at the south end was a memorial fresco featuring stained glass panels and a bronze angel, commemorating the war dead.\n\nThe exterior of the south end of the arena had a large Greyhounds logo and a list of all the years that Sault teams had won league championships and the Memorial Cup.\n\nUnderneath the stands on the east side, in the corridor beside the Greyhounds dressing room, was the \"Greyhounds alumni wall\". Every Greyhounds alumnus had his name painted on the wall under the year in which he graduated from the team. The exact wording at the beginning of the list read:\nSince its inauguration in 1949, the building has seen some dramatic changes.\n\nThe last Greyhounds game was played on March 28, 2006, a playoff game versus the London Knights. David Bolland of the London Knights scored the last goal, in game four of the first round playoff series.\n\nThe building was officially decommissioned and closed to the public on April 9, 2006 in much the same fashion that it was ceremonially opened. Royal Canadian Legion members and other dignitaries were on hand to bid farewell to an important piece of Northern Ontario, and Sault Ste. Marie's heritage. Demolition of the building's interior began on April 27, 2006, with final exterior demolition beginning May 27, 2006. At the time of demolition, the Sault Memorial Gardens was the second oldest operational arena in the Ontario Hockey League. Only the Windsor Arena was older.\n\nAll that remains of the former building is the preserved Memorial Tower, and its beacon. The decision not to demolish the tower, shows its importance to local history, and to remember war veterans. The city block that contains the site of the tower, and the arena facility, is now known as \"Memorial Square\".\n\nThe Memorial Gardens played host to the Memorial Cup tournament in 1978 and 1993, as well as the 1979 OHL All-Star Game.\n\nThe last big tournament played in the Gardens was the 2003 Air Canada Cup, Canada's national midget hockey championship.\n\nAside from hockey, the 1990 Labatt Brier, the Canadian men's curling championship, and the 1996 Canadian National Gymnastics Championship were hosted in the Gardens.\n\nArtists that have performed at Memorial Gardens include, Stompin' Tom Connors, Randy Travis, Tom Cochrane, Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Alice Cooper, Billy Ray Cyrus, Rush, The Tragically Hip, Rita MacNeil, Bryan Adams, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson, Helix, Great White, and Honeymoon Suite, among others.\n\nOther larger performances include WWF Wrestling, Smurfs on Ice, and the PharmAssist Skate the Nation Tour.\n\n\n"}

It is home to the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League.\n\nIt has an ice size of 200' x 85', with a capacity of 4,640 seated, 5,100 standing and is wheelchair accessible.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, the arena underwent extensive renovations, which added 12 private boxes and a new club seating section, with padded seats and refreshments services along with new washrooms, concession stand and lounge. Seating was sacrificed to make way for the improvements. Standing room capacity was shrunk from 1,000 to 500, while seating capacity was dropped by 150. The new arena capacity, with standing room patrons, became 5,100, down from 5,750.\n\nOn November 5, 2015, a life size statue of Stompin' Tom Connors was unveiled on the grounds of the arena.

Established in November 1991, it became part of Dixons Retail in February 1993, and then part of Dixons Carphone after the merger of Dixons Retail and Carphone Warehouse in August 2014. Many of its physical shops in the United Kingdom now trade under the combined \"Currys PC World\" brand, and PC City in Italy, when this branch of the brand was still trading. \n\nAll stores of PC City in Italy have now ceased trading.\n\nIn November 1991, Vision Technology Group Ltd, led by Jan Murray, opened the first PC World shop in Purley Way, Croydon. In February 1993, when Dixons Group plc (now Dixons Carphone) purchased the chain, there were four PC World shops in existence. There followed a period of expansion, as more shops were opened across the country. Jan Murray attainined an annual turnover of £50 million by April 1992, as he had opened the four largest flagship stores around London.\n\nThis expansion was partly driven by a series of acquisitions, beginning with \"DN Computer Services\" in November 1996, followed by \"Byte Computer Superstores Ltd\" in April 1998, and MicroWarehouse in June 2004.\n\nIn September 2006, PC World UK assumed management control of its French subsidiary. In 2006, there were 163 PC World shops in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the United Kingdom, PC World Business was launched in September 1997. Since March 2001, PC World Business has been based in Bury, Greater Manchester, and has its own management team.\n\nIn October 2006, PC World launched \"The Connected Home\", selling PC based home entertainment systems and installation services. During 2007 to 2008, PC World was due to undergo a style change, with a proposed new logo, staff uniforms, shop layouts, as part of its image re branding programme. The changes were trialled at branches in Brentford, Colchester, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Southampton, Isle of Wight, Enfield, Burnley and North Shields.\n\nIn August 2008, the \"proposed\" logo was shelved, in favour of a new logo. In December 2008, PC World reported its first ever loss, posting underlying losses of £29.8 million in the six months to October 2008, compared to a £52.4 million profit in 2007.\n\nThe shops offer ranges of consumer oriented PCs, laptops and peripherals, including DSG shops' own brand Advent and PC Line. Shops also have a \"KnowHow desk\", which offers advice and services. Some shops also have a \"Component Centre\" area, which contains more basic PC components such as motherboards, hard drives and cases.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, it was announced that PC World would begin selling Dell PCs in their shops. This was one of many moves Dell made to sell their desktops and laptops to a wider market. This also includes Dell selling their XPS systems in many HMV shops across the United Kingdom.\n\nPC World opened their first two in one megastore with Currys at Wandsworth Bridge, Fulham, on 29 October 2009, followed by Merry Hill Shopping Centre (West Midlands), Aintree (Merseyside) Teesside Park (Stockton-on-Tees) and Bridge of Dee (Aberdeen) in June and July 2010.\n\nPC World closed their last remaining standalone shop in Ayr, in the week commencing 26 March 2018, and now exists solely online and as part of the Currys megastores.\n\nIn February 2005, PC World attracted criticism, for the strong promotion of extended warranties (also known as insurance and support packages) and in May 2013, if an extended warranty is not purchased, customers are required to use outsourced, local rate telephone support for hardware issues or premium rate telephone lines (£1/minute, except for set up which is 75p/minute) for software issues.\n\nAn internet survey by \"Which?\" in June 2004 ranked PC World joint last for customer satisfaction. In March 2006, PC World attempted to get away from its reputation for having sales staff on up to 20% commission, who would therefore use high pressure sales tactics with its \"One Team\" marketing campaign.\n\nThe bonus is also based on other non monetary metrics, such as customer satisfaction. To compensate the 275 highest earners under the old scheme for reduced bonuses, their basic pay was raised by 16% from around £11,000 to around £13,000 per year.\n\nIn December 2007, in an response to the perception that PC World staff are often young, and lacking in knowledge and communications skills, a set of e learning courses called \"The Power of Knowledge\" were completed by 6,000 staff. The results were incorporated into their Christmas bonuses, as an incentive for staff to improve their knowledge.\n\nAnother survey for \"Which?\" in January 2008 revealed that PC World was ranked in the bottom ten retailers in the United Kingdom. In June 2014, \"Which?\" also reported PC World overcharging for repairs, and lack of technical competence among technicians. This was from seven sampled shops.\n\nIn March 2014, an \"offensive\" PC World logo was visible, if you had typed 'computer superstore' on Google. In June 2014, the BBC's consumer awareness programme \"Watchdog\" found that PC World was accused of misselling HDMI cables in 9 out of 15 test purchases, claiming that the more you pay the better the quality, which was a false statement.\n\nIn November 1997, Gary Glitter took a laptop into a branch of PC World in Bristol for repair, where child abuse imagery was found by staff, who informed the police and Glitter was subsequently charged and found guilty of possessing child pornography. This conviction severely damaged Glitter's reputation, and effectively ended his career.\n\nIn January 2006, after numerous complaints, PC World was forced to remove an advert, that gave misinformation about wireless networking. There have also been countless other complaints over adverts, particularly regarding goods advertised, but not actually available in the shops.\n\nIn September 2007, a customer alleged that when he returned a laptop under warranty with a faulty hinge, PC World refused to honour their warranty because he had installed a Linux operating system on the laptop, and therefore had invalidated the warranty he had had on the product, although the fault was a hardware matter and would not have been affected by the operating system installed.\n\nIn September 2009, PC World staff were investigated for posting abusive and offensive comments about customers on Facebook.\n\nPC World currently trades only in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It has previously traded in other European countries, but has disposed of these as the parent company refocussed. The European shops traded under the name PC City. In February 2007, the French shops were the first of the Mainland Europe shops to be closed down.\n\nIn April 2009, the Swedish shops were closed down, and the online operation then switched to the \"ElectroWorld\" brand. 34 shops in Spain also operated under the brand \"PC City\". In April 2011, however, all Spanish shops were closed, as part of Dixons Retail's withdrawal from the market in Spain.\n\n\n"}

Looney Tunes animated cartoons.\n\nFranklyn was born in New York City September 16, 1897, to the marriage of Julius B. Frumkin (1874–1913) and Fanny Hertzberg (maiden; 1876–1932). Julius Frumkin had been the proprietor of Frumkin's Cigar Stores in Salt Lake City, notably the Mission Cigar Store at 139 South Main Street. Franklyn was three years old when his family moved from New York to Salt Lake City. Franklyn attended high school in Salt Lake City and graduated June 10, 1915. He finished one year at the University of Utah. He was the state junior tennis champion in Utah for six years. The next two years were spent at the University of California, Berkeley, then he began a term at Pennsylvania University when he was called to service in World War One. Franklyn did not serve overseas; he trained as a naval officer for three months and then the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. He returned to Berkeley to finish his education.\n\nAs Franklyn could play a number of instruments, he joined a band in San Francisco and for the next few years played at the Palace and St. Francis hotels. He began his own nine-piece orchestra, known at various times as the Peninsula Band, the Super Soloists, and the Merrimakers, and appeared in San Mateo (1926 to June 1927), where he also owned a music store, and San Jose (1928 to January 1929), where he was Master of Ceremonies and wrote revues for the California Theatre before moving on to Fresno and Oakland. For two years he was emcee with Fanchon and Marco at Fox West Coast in San Diego; musical director and emcee with Paramount Publix Corporation, travelling to Seattle, Denver, Houston and Toledo; and finally worked on the Loew's circuit in Providence, Rhode Island and New York City from 1933 to 1935. Franklyn quit vaudeville to go to Hollywood in 1935 and spent a year doing occasional work.\n\nIn early 1936, he joined Warner Bros. as music arranger to Carl Stalling, becoming music director in 1953. The first cartoon with Franklyn credited as a composer was \"Bugs and Thugs\", released in 1954, though Franklyn estimated at the time his 599th cartoon for Warners was \"Past Perfumance\". Franklyn always composed his scores at home early in the morning; he only went to the studio to watch the 30-piece Warner Bros. Orchestra record the music or to view the finished cartoon. Among the songs Franklyn is said to have composed with director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese is \"The Michigan Rag\" for the 1955 cartoon \"One Froggy Evening\", featuring Michigan J. Frog. However, the ASCAP database lists only Maltese as the composer. He became the sole composer in 1958 upon Stalling's retirement.\n\nFranklyn died of a heart attack on April 24, 1962. At the time of his death, Franklyn was composing the score for a Tweety cartoon, \"The Jet Cage\". The first two minutes of the cartoon were scored by Franklyn, the rest by William Lava, who had been working on the Warner Bros. main lot and replaced him as musical director. \"The Jet Cage\" opening credits lists Franklyn and not Lava, while the ASCAP database credits Franklyn with composing the opening title, with no mention of Lava, but a change in composing style in the cartoon is noticeable.\n\nFranklyn joined ASCAP in 1954 and was a member of the Academy of TV Arts and Sciences. He and his wife Charlotte K. Franklyn were registered Democrats.\n\nAfter his death, Franklyn's music also appeared in \"Bugs Bunny on Broadway\".\n"}

This district area is 3,811.9 square kilometres, and population (year 2000 census) was 35,300. It is 1200 km from the state capital, Kuching and 200 km from the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu.\n\nThere are several versions of the origin of the name \"Lawas\". It reportedly came from the Malay word \"luas\" which means \"spacious\". During the earlier days, people tend to settle down in spacious areas and thus the town was born. In another version of the story, there was once a group of merchants who were attacked and chased by the pirates at the mouth of the Lawas river. The merchants managed to hid themselves in the middle of the jungle and the pirates could not find them. Feelling relieved and secure, the merchants returned to the sea. In the local dialect, \"Lawas\" means \"relief, safe, and secure\".\n\nOn 7 September 1901, British North Borneo Company (BNBC) had obtained the administrative rights of the Lawas river from Brunei Sultanate in order to stem the smuggling of weapons that worked against the BNBC government in North Borneo (present day Sabah) and the trading of slaves in the interior of the Lawas district. There were two types of rights exist in the Brunei administrative system: \"sungai kerajaan\" (government river) and \"sungai tulin\" (private river). Government control on the river includes the rights to all the minerals mined from the river and the right to interfere if there is any political disturbances around the river. Private ownership of the river functioned like a private inheritance which includes the right collect taxes from the residents living near the river. At that time, Pengiran Abu Bakar and Pengiran Tajudin had the private ownership of the Lawas river. They refused to surrender their private ownerships to BNBC but keen to sell their rights to Kingdom of Sarawak. When the British Consul at Labuan decided that BNBC should take over the Lawas river by force, Pengiran Abu Bakar quickly invited Rajah Charles Brooke from Kingdom of Sarawak to govern the Lawas river. BNBC initially was unhappy with the Brooke involvement in the administration of Lawas river. However, in November 1904, BNBC decided the sell their administrative right to Brooke in view of private owners unwilling to cooperate with BNBC; taking Lawas river by force will only spark more rebellion against BNBC and drain the BNBC cash reserves. On 19 January 1905, an agreement was signed between BNBC and Rajah Charles Brooke which saw the official handover of Lawas river to the Brooke government in exchange of 5000 pounds and several administrative areas around Brunei bay to BNBC. An agreement was later reached with the private owners to sell Lawas river to the Brooke government with reparation of 6,000 dollars per year to the private owners.\n\nLawas is made up of a population comprising Lun Bawang, Kedayan, Brunei Malay, Murut Tagal and Chinese. The main spoken language is Brunei Malay, Kedayan, Lun Bawang and Hokkien.\n\nAs with Limbang, the town is a busy transit point between Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei.\nTimber and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy. The highland area known as Ba'Kelalan has been experimenting with the cultivation of apples. In addition, the tourism industry is being developed in Ba'Kelalan. However, these plans have been met with controversy due to the probable effects on several traditional tribal villages. Plans to develop small and middle scale industries in Lawas have been proposed by the state government. \nAt this time much of the land in Lawas, Sundar and Trusan has been transformed from padi fields into oil palm plantations. Lawas is also known as the producer of smoked fish called 'Tahai' in local dialect. One of the villages that produces 'Tahai' commercially is Kampung Awat-Awat in the Sundar sub-district.\n\nLawas, by virtue of its geographical location, is cut off from the rest of Sarawak's road network. It is however linked by main road to Sabah and Brunei's Temburong district. There is a good local road network around Lawas district which is relatively free of traffic jams.\n\nTravelling to or from Lawas by road requires undergoing immigration checks. Travelling to the rest of Sarawak requires a passport. Two road border crossings are located in Lawas district. \n\nAnother mode of transport is via the Lawas River. The cleaned river serves as an important link to neighbouring towns and deep interior settlements. Besides that, Lawas is also served by an airport. There has also been a plan to build a new airport. Commonly, four wheel drive would be the main transport for most of the highlanders.\n\nBrunei, Labuan and Limbang can be reached by boat. The journey will take around two hours to get to the destination. Boats to Brunei, Labuan and Limbang are available at Lawas Wharf every morning. The boats can accommodate around 150 passengers.\n\nLawas is served by Lawas Airport (IATA: LWY). It has flights to Miri, Ba' Kelalan and Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.\nThere is a local bus network as well as buses linking Lawas with Kota Kinabalu (Sabah), Miri (Sarawak) and Brunei.\n\n\nPlanned:\n\nProposed:\n\n\nA government hospital was proposed to be built for the town under the Ninth Malaysia Plan. As of May 2016, the hospital is scheduled to be completed in 36 months.\n\nA planned RM210 million state government office complex cum three-storey shopping mall will be built next to Hotel Seri Malaysia and Lawas Town Square. The mall will houses a supermarket, departmental store and 132 commercial lots.\n\nThe open-air market, locally known as tamu, is held weekly on from Friday evening until Saturday afternoon. Local produce such as fresh fruits, vegetables, fresh meat, Adan rice, Bario rice, Ikan Tahai, Hill salts (Garam Bakelalan), handycraft traditional and live poultry are sold. The days of this weekly community occasion differ from district to district.\n\n\nOne of the most popular tourist attractions in Lawas is its Tamu Lawas (or Lawas Produce Market), which is held every Saturday. Local products such as vegetables, fruits and sea products are sold by locals in this market which is frequented by locals and people from the neighbouring Temburong district of Brunei.\n\nBesides Tamu Lawas, other interesting places in Lawas are Punang Beach, Sungai Bangat Beach, Pa' Lelau in Merarap, Mount Murud, Kampung air Terjun (along Jalan Trusan). \nKuala Lawas, Punang and Awat Awat are famous with its Kampung Air. It is similar to Kampung Ayer in Brunei but smaller. The main mode of transportation is perahu (boat) to cross the river.\n\n"}

Earlier, it was the centre of Torgay Region, which was abolished in 1997. Today, it is the administrative centre of Torgay District, Kostanay Region. \nEstablished in 1956, it acquired the status of the city in 1965. The distance from the town of Arkalyk to Kostanay is , to Nur-Sultan is . Population: \n\nThe Arkalyk Business Centre describes today's Arkalyk as \"a city of miners, of regional administrators, and people excited to live in a regional center\". Historically Arkalyk was a centre for the Soviet space programme. Cosmonauts would land on the huge central Kazakh steppe and come back to Arkalyk before heading to the Baikonur, the Soviet Union's premier \"space city\". Arkalyk is served by Arkalyk Airport.\n\nThe city is linked by rail communication with the regional center (terminal station on a branch Esil - Derzhavinsk - Arkalyk). Roads Kostanay - Arkalyk tarmac, but is severely broken in the state. Roads Zhezkazgan - Arkalyk ground, in the wet weather becomes difficult even for freight transport because of mud. There is an airport (located 6 kilometers north-east of the city), capable of class aircraft Tu-154, Tu-134, etc. In Soviet times, it carried out flights to many cities in Kazakhstan, but since the mid-1990s an airport has been practically abandoned and used only sporadically during the search and rescue for the planting of manned spaceaids.\n\nArkalyk was founded in 1956 as a settlement of geologists and builders. By birth, it was obliged to open after the war for deposits of bauxite (raw material for aluminum production). On May 17, 1956, in a joint decree of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers a separate line was written: «On the basis of Amangeldy bauxite deposits construct and put into operation Torghay bauxite mines ». In the 1960s Arkalyk was declared the All-Union shock Komsomol building, there was the young people flock from all over the USSR. In 1965 Arkalyk received city status and in 1971 became the center of the newly created Torghay area. \n\nIn the 1980s the city reached its peak: it produced meat, poultry, and dairy. It functioned grain elevator, ceramic factory, sewing factory, the factory radio, factory built Aviamotornaya, Turgay bauxite mine (TBRU), which extracted up to 20% of bauxite ores in the USSR. But despite the industrial production, the economy of Torgay Region was behind other regions of Kazakhstan due to large agricultural sector which was 90%. The region constantly demanded subsidies from the national budget, so in June 1988 it was dissolved and its territory was divided between Kostanai and Aqmola areas. When the city stopped to be a regional center, some parts of the infrastructure was evacuated (for example, regional radio station), and a number of potential industrial sites was frozen. \n\nIn 1989, active inhabitants of Arkalyk organized committee to restore Torgay Region. In August 1990, Torgay Region was re-established, and Arkalyk become the regional center again.\n\nDegradation of the city began in 1993-1994: production fell into decay. Migration began to other regions of Kazakhstan, Russia and Germany. Consequently, population of the city reduced. In 1991 it was 65,000 people, in 1999 it was 45,000, now it is 23,000 people. During 90s there were disrupted public services such as lengthy interruption of electricity, heat and water. In 1997, Turgay area has been disbanded again, and its territory was again moved into Kostanai and Akmola areas. \n\nSome of the city districts as a part of #6, all of #7 and #9 were completely abandoned by the 2000s. Migration from the city was a complicated process which started in 90s. Full optimization stopped in 2000–2001. Enterprising businessmen from other regions of Kazakhstan dismantled the houses by removing building materials. \n\nAt the turn of 20th and 21st century, local authorities organized a campaign to relocate the remaining residents from the abandoned districts to the older city center, so the cost for municipal services would be reduced and communication would be significantly improved.\n\nCurrently, the city of Arkalyk is included in the list of depressed cities of Kazakhstan due to a very high level of unemployment. Industry in the city is virtually non-existent, except for maintaining the life of city and Torgayskogo bauxite mine, which is housed in SC «Aluminum of Kazakhstan». All produced bauxiteore is sent to the aluminum plant in Pavlodar, and other regions. Establishment of an aluminum smelter in Arkalyk is difficult due to lack of water.\n\nProspectives of Arkalyk are dual. On the one hand, the town has the bauxite mine which over the next 15–20 years will exhaust deposits and it will be possible to extract refractory clay only. On the other hand, there are a number of other minerals such as Jean-Arkalykskoe field has the shallow bed (up to 50 meters); Akzhalskoe field nefritoidov has the jewelry and raw materials; Akbulakskoe field has white marble; Agyrzhalskoe field has black marble; Jean-Arkalykskoe has deposits of therapeutic mineral waters. Development of these fields could lead to the economic and social revival of the region.\n\nIn Arkalyk, the climate is cold and temperate. There is more rainfall in winter than in summer. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is Dfa. The average annual temperature in Arkalyk is . About of precipitation falls annually.\n\n\nArea is a hilly terrain with absolute marks 320–360 meters north of the city up to . The radius of from the city are extensive mining (related to mining bauxite ore), the depth of 20–50 m. \n\nThe natural reservoirs are not numerous, except for two drying creeks Akjar (in the northern part of town) and Arkalyksay (in the southern part of town), running from the East to the West.\n\nNear the town of Arkalyk is 6 bauxite for the aluminum industry. This Arkalyk, Lower Ashut, Ushtobe, Northern, Upper Ashut and Aktas. These same deposits associated classes of refractory clay. In addition, the bauxite, the associated component is gallium, stocks of which is formed by 761 kilograms. At the distance of from the city there is another lead field \"Jana-Arkalyk\" under exploration. Among the associated components of the ore we can find yttrium, gold, silver, tin, and others. The reserves of Jana-Arkalyk deposit are estimated at 6 million tons of lead. In the same area there are 37 fields common minerals including 28-brick commodity, 4-building stone, construction sand 5. from the city there is Akzhal deposit of nephritis, which was mined in 1997 for extraction purposes of decorative facing stone. Within the radius of 70–100 km away from the city there are deposits with an estimated volume of 3-6 million cubic metres of White Akbulak Marble and deposits of Agirjal black marble with reserves of about 8 million cubic metres.

Swaffham Prior was often known as Great Swaffham in past centuries. It should not be confused with the town of Swaffham in Norfolk.\n\nThe village is dominated by its twin churches that have served the parish since at least the 12th century – the Church of St Mary, and the Church of St Cyriac and St Julitta (dedicated to Saint Quiricus and Saint Julietta). In 1667 a parliamentary order combined the churches under a single parish.\n\nThe church of St Mary was first built in Norman times, and over its history has at times been allowed to fall into ruin, only being fully restored at the start of the 20th century and now serving as the parish church. It contains a rood screen, and has a series of stained glass windows showing scenes from World War I.\n\nThe original church of St Cyriac and St Julitta (Cyriac's mother) was built prior to 1200, and may possibly have existed before 1066. The present chapel is a plain Gothic-style church, consisting of a small chancel and nave with three small transeptal chapels. The tower was built in the 15th century and contains 6 bells. Having fallen into disuse, in 1878 an order was received that the church be demolished, but the order was never carried out. It now serves as a hall for exhibitions and other functions. Scottish poet Edwin Muir (1887–1959) is buried here.\n\nJohn George Witt, the barrister and Q.C./K.C., was born in 1836 at Denny Abbey, Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, and was a son of James Maling Witt (1799–1870), a prosperous farmer at Waterbeach and at Queens' College Farm, Swaffham Prior. J.G. Witt lived at Swaffham Prior during much of his youth and early manhood. He died in London in 1906. J.G. Witt's uncle, Dr. George Witt (1804 - 1869), was born at Swaffham Prior and died at 22 Princes' Terrace, Hyde Park, London. He was buried at Swaffham Prior.\n\nJust a mile or so north of Swaffham Prior is the Anglo-Saxon defensive earthwork known as the Devil's Dyke, blocking a land route through the fens.\n\nSwaffham Prior is an old village, and is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as possibly 'Great Swaffham', with Swaffham Bulbeck being 'Little Swaffham'. There are houses in the village dating back several centuries, with the 17th century being most prominent. Though previously a trading village, today it could be described as a 'dormitory' village especially looking back on its busier past. Local facilities include a local primary school and The Red Lion pub. There's also a village hall, hosting village feasts, village fêtes, etc.\n\nSwaffham Prior is also known for its two windmills (one still operating as a mill) which are symbols of the village, seen on the village sign on Cage Hill.\n\nChildren initially attend the Swaffham Prior Church of England Primary School in the village and usually then go on to Bottisham Village College, in another village.\n\nSwaffham Prior chalk escarpment, observable only in a few places within the village is largely physically hidden from view. This local geological feature of the landscape is the chalk (local term \"clunch\") escarpment of Swaffham Prior and it runs the full length of this East Cambridgeshire village dating back to Anglo-saxon times. The more modern sections of the village are built along the top of the escarpment with the older houses nestling below the cliff face backing on to the high street.\n\nThe chalk escarpment straddles two very different local eco-systems- the Cambridgeshire Fens to the west, where the land slopes down and the chalk heathland to the east, known locally as Swaffham Prior heath, part of the Greater Newmarket chalk heath, where the land height increases and plateaus into a larger area towards the east.\n\nIn a few places, the ridge of the escarpment is exposed, although usually within private property. A fraction of it can be seen from the high street, opposite the parish play area.\n\nCensus counts for the village have been paired with Burwell and Reach at various times.

{"id": "1890199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890199", "title": "Interactive whiteboard", "text": "Interactive whiteboard\n\nAn interactive whiteboard (IWB) also commonly known as Interactive board or Smart boards is a large interactive display in the form factor of a whiteboard. It can either be a standalone touchscreen computer used independently to perform tasks and operations, or a connectable apparatus used as a touchpad to control computers from a projector. They are used in a variety of settings, including classrooms at all levels of education, in corporate board rooms and work groups, in training rooms for professional sports coaching, in broadcasting studios, and others.\n\nThe first interactive whiteboards were designed and manufactured for use in the office. They were developed by PARC around 1990. This board was used in small group meetings and round-tables. \n\nThe interactive whiteboard industry was expected to reach sales of US$1 billion worldwide by 2008; one of every seven classrooms in the world was expected to feature an interactive whiteboard by 2011 according to market research by Futuresource Consulting. In 2004, 26% of British primary classrooms had interactive whiteboards. The Becta Harnessing Technology Schools Survey 2007 indicated that 98% of secondary and 100% of primary schools had IWBs. By 2008, the average numbers of interactive whiteboards rose in both primary schools (18 compared with just over six in 2005, and eight in the 2007 survey) and secondary schools (38, compared with 18 in 2005 and 22 in 2007).\n\nAn interactive whiteboard (IWB) device can either be a standalone computer or a large, functioning touchpad for computers to use.\n\nA device driver is usually installed on the attached computer so that the interactive whiteboard can act as a Human Input Device (HID), like a mouse. The computer's video output is connected to a digital projector so that images may be projected on the interactive whiteboard surface.\n\nThe user then calibrates the whiteboard image by matching the position of the projected image in reference to the whiteboard using a pointer as necessary. After this, the pointer or other device may be used to activate programs, buttons and menus from the whiteboard itself, just as one would ordinarily do with a mouse. If text input is required, user can invoke an on-screen keyboard or, if the whiteboard software provides for this, utilize handwriting recognition. This makes it unnecessary to go to the computer keyboard to enter text.\n\nThus, an IWB emulates both a mouse and a keyboard. The user can conduct a presentation or a class almost exclusively from the whiteboard.\n\nIn addition, most IWBs are supplied with software that provides tools and features specifically designed to maximize interaction opportunities. These generally include the ability to create virtual versions of paper flipcharts, pen and highlighter options, and possibly even virtual rulers, protractors, and compasses—instruments that would be used in traditional classroom teaching.\n\nUses for interactive whiteboards may include:\n\nThe majority of IWBs sold globally involve one of four forms of interaction between the user and the content projected on the whiteboard. These are an infrared scan technology; a resistive, touch-based board; an electromagnetic pen and associated software; and an ultrasonic pen.\n\nAn infrared interactive whiteboard is a large interactive display that connects to a computer and projector. The board is typically mounted to a wall or floor stand. Movement of the user's finger, pen, or other pointer over the image projected on the whiteboard is captured by its interference with infrared light at the surface of the whiteboard.\nWhen the whiteboard surface is pressed, software triangulates the location of the marker or stylus. Infrared IWBs may be made of any material, no dry-erase markers are involved, and may be found in many settings, including various levels of classroom education, corporate boardrooms, training or activity rooms for organizations, professional sports coaching facilities, and broadcasting studios.\n\nA touch-based IWB also involves a simple pointing device. In this case, the material of the board is important. In the most common resistive system, a membrane stretched over the surface deforms under pressure to make contact with a conducting backplate. The touch point location can then be determined electronically and registered as a mouse event. For example, when a finger is pressed on the surface, it is registered as the equivalent of the left mouse click. Again, such a board requires no special instruments. This leads to the claim of resistive systems manufacturers that such a whiteboard is easy and natural to use. It is, however, heavily dependent on the construction of the board itself.\n\nAn electromagnetic pen-based interactive whiteboard involves an array of wires embedded behind the solid board surface that interacts with a coil in the stylus tip to determine the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the stylus. The pen itself usually is passive, i.e., it contains no batteries or other power source; it alters the electrical signals produced by the board. For instance, when close to the surface of the board, the mouse pointer can be sensed, giving the board \"mouse-over\" capabilities. When it is pressed in against the board in one way, the board activates a switch in the pen to signal a mouse click to the computer; pressed in another way, contact with the board signals a click of the right mouse-button. Like a scaled-up version of a graphics tablet used by professional digital artists and designers, an electromagnetic IWB can emulate mouse actions accurately, will not malfunction if a user leans on the board, and can potentially handle multiple inputs.\n\nThis technology uses infrared light and ultrasound positioning technology. The technology works in a similar way to lightning in a thunderstorm by computing the time difference between the speed of light and the speed of sound. An infrared IWB is also available in a portable format. After moving the set-up to a new location, the system acquires connection to the computer with a simple re-calibration of the projected image — again using the electronic pen. The device or bar scans a bracketed area (usually 3m by 1.5m, giving a whiteboard that is 110\" wide). Typically, multiple brackets can be added, providing for users at different sites to share the same virtual whiteboard.\n\nA portable IR pen-based whiteboard works on a variety of surfaces — an existing whiteboard, a flat wall, even a chalkboard with dry-erase paint, transforms those surface into an interactive whiteboard. No battery is required for USB signal receiver and the unit can be mounted to the ceiling if a permanent solution is required. Made of a tiny and lightweight material, the PIWB is easy to transport.\n\nA Wii-based IR system was invented by Johnny Chung Lee, PhD. in 2007. Lee claimed that the system \"[m]akes a technology available to a much wider percentage of the population\" (Speaking at TED, April 2008) by using an ordinary Wii remote control as a pointer and the IR camera on the front of the remote control as tracking device sensing light from an IR light pen. Lee produced several videos on YouTube about this system to demonstrate its operability, flexibility, and ease of use, and pointing out its modest price — the most inexpensive part is the infrared LED of the pen. This is an approach with a shallow learning curve since the gaming system is already familiar to many. A large programming support community may be available, both in opensource and commercial offerings.) However, the system cannot be used near direct sunlight, nor can it share the software of manufacturers of the IWB-types already mentioned. Certain considerations about the Bluetooth connection of the light pen also apply. Two lines of sight are involved (the controller and the pen) in the case of rear-projection case. unlike many others.)\n\nAn interactive projector IWB involves a CMOS camera built into the projector, so that the projector produces the IWB image, but also detects the position of an active IR light pen when it contacts the surface where the image is projected. This solution, developed in 2007 and patented in 2010 by U.S. manufacturer Boxlight, like the other IR whiteboard systems, can suffer from potential problems caused by 'line of sight' between the pen and the projector/receiver and, like them also, does not provide mouse-over capability found in other solutions.\n\nIn some classrooms, interactive whiteboards have replaced traditional whiteboards or flipcharts, or video/media systems such as a DVD player and TV combination. Even where traditional boards are used, the IWB often supplements them by connecting to a school network digital video distribution system. In other cases, IWBs interact with online shared annotation and drawing environments such as interactive vector based graphical websites.\n\nBrief instructional blocks can be recorded for review by students — they will see the exact presentation that occurred in the classroom with the teacher's audio input. This can help transform learning and instruction.\n\nMany companies and projects now focus on creating supplemental instructional materials specifically designed for interactive whiteboards. Electrokite out of Boston, MA, for example, will have the first complete curriculum for schools and districts.\n\nOne recent use of the IWB is in shared reading lessons. Mimic books, for instance, allow teachers to project children's books onto the interactive whiteboard with book-like interactivity.\n\nDixons City Academy in the North of England was the first non college or university learning environment to make use of interactive whiteboards after the school's then principal Sir John Lewis showed a keen interest in the developing technology. An interactive whiteboard can now be found in every classroom of the school.\n\nSome manufacturers also provide classroom response systems as an integrated part of their interactive whiteboard products. Handheld 'clickers' operating via Infrared or Radio signals, for example, offer basic multiple choice and polling options. More sophisticated clickers offer text and numeric responses and can export an analysis of student performance for subsequent review.\n\nBy combining classroom response with an interactive whiteboard system, teachers can present material and receive feedback from students in order to direct instruction more effectively or else to carry out formal assessments. For example, a student may both solve a puzzle involving math concepts on the interactive whiteboard and later demonstrate his or her knowledge on a test delivered via the classroom response system. Some classroom response software can organize and develop activities and tests aligned with State standards.\n\nThere are now several studies revealing contradictory conclusions about the effect of the use of IWBs is effective on student learning. A compilation of this research is available.\n\nAccording to the findings of a study conducted by the London Institute of Education with the funding of the DfES evaluated the educational and operational effectiveness of the London Challenge element of the adoption of the use of interactive whiteboards in the London area under a program called \"the Schools Whiteboard Expansion project.\" At Key Stage 3, interactive whiteboards here associated with little significant impact on student performance in Mathematics and English and only a slight improvement in Science. In the same schools, at Key Stage 4, use of interactive whiteboards was found to have negative effects for Mathematics and Science, but positive effects for English. The authors cite several possible causes for the Key Stage 4 findings, including: a Type II statistical error, disruption to teaching methods leading to reduced pupil performance when IWBs were installed, or a non-random deployment decision of IWB installation resulting in a skew of the data.\n\nAt the same time, there is evidence of improved performance gains with the use of interactive whiteboards. The BECTA (UK) commissioned a study into the impact of Interactive Whiteboards over a two-year period. This study showed a very significant learning gains, particularly with second cohorts of students, where they benefited from the teacher's experience with the device.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2004, The DfES Primary Schools Whiteboard Expansion project (PSWE) provided substantial funding to 21 local authorities for the acquisition and use of interactive whiteboards in UK primary schools. The BECTA-sponsored study investigated the impact of this investment with 20 local authorities, using data for 7272 learners in 97 schools.\n\nVariables considered in the research included length of exposure to interactive whiteboard technology, the age of pupils (down to individual birthdays), gender, special needs, entitlement to free schools meals and other socio-economic groupings. The implementation and impacts of the project were evaluated by a team at Manchester Metropolitan University, led by Professor Bridget Somekh. To date it is the largest and longest study conducted into the impact of interactive whiteboards.\n\nThe principal finding of this large-scale study was that, \"[w]hen teachers have used an interactive whiteboard for a considerable period of time (by the autumn of 2006 for at least two years) its use becomes embedded in their pedagogy as a mediating artefact for their interactions with their pupils, and pupils’ interactions with one another.\" The authors of the study argued that \"mediating interactivity\" is a sound concept, offering \"a ... theoretical explanation for the way in which the multi-level modelling (MLM) analyses link the length of time pupils have been taught with interactive whiteboards to greater progress in national test scores year on year.\"\"\n\nThe research showed that interactive whiteboard technology led to consistent gains across all key stages and subjects with increasingly significant impact on the second cohorts, indicating that embedding of the technology into the classroom and teacher experience with the technology are key factors.\n\nGains were measured in ‘months progress’ against standard measures of attainment over the two-year study period.\n\nIn infant classes, ages 5–7:\n\nThere was also clear evidence of similar impacts in Key stage two – ages 7 – 11\nThere was no adverse impact observed at any level.\n\nGlover & Miller conducted a study on the pedagogic impact of interactive whiteboards in a secondary school. They found that although interactive whiteboards are theoretically more than a computer if it is only being used as an adjunct to teaching its potential remains unrealized. The authors’ research was primarily to ascertain the extent and type of use in the classroom.\nIn order to determine if any change in pedagogy or teaching strategies was taking place the researchers conducted a detailed questionnaire. The authors found that the teachers used the IWBs in one of three ways; as an aid to efficiency, as an extension device, and as a transformative device. They noted that teachers’ use of the technology was not primarily affected by training, access, or software availability. When used as a transformative device (approximately 10% of teachers taking part in the study) the impact on pedagogy was transformative.\n\nIn recent times, manufacturers of IWB technology have been setting up various online support communities for teachers and educational institutions deploying the use of the interactive whiteboards in learning environments. Such websites regularly contribute research findings and administer free whiteboard lessons to promote widespread use of interactive whiteboards in classrooms.\n\nSome of the benefits of using interactive whiteboards include:\n\nAccording to a June 11, 2010 \"Washington Post\" article:\n\nThe same article also quotes Larry Cuban, education professor emeritus at Stanford University:\n\nAn article posted on the National Association of Secondary School Principals web site details pros & cons of interactive whiteboards.\nA report on interactive whiteboards from London's Institute of Education said:\n\n\nThe report highlighted the following issues:\n\n\nThere are a number of literature reviews, findings and papers on the use of interactive whiteboards in the classroom:\n\n\nInteractive whiteboards may use one of several types of sensing technology to track interaction on the screen surface: resistive, electromagnetic, infrared optical, laser, ultra-sonic, and camera-based (optical).\n\n\n\n\n\nPermanent markers and use of regular dry erase markers can create problems on some interactive whiteboard surfaces because interactive whiteboard surfaces are most often melamine, which is a porous, painted surface that can absorb marker ink. Punctures, dents and other damage to surfaces are also a risk.\n\nSome educators have found that the use of interactive whiteboards reinforces an age-old teaching method: the teacher speaks, and students listen. This teaching model is contrary to many modern instructional models.\n\nInteractive whiteboards are generally available in two forms: front projection and rear projection.\n\n\nSome manufacturers also provide an option to raise and lower the display to accommodate users of different heights.\n\nSome manufacturers offer short-throw projection systems in which a projector with a special wide angle lens is mounted much closer to the interactive whiteboard surface and projects down at an angle of around 45 degrees. These vastly reduce the shadow effects of traditional front-projection systems and eliminate any chance for a user to see the projector beam. The risk of projector theft, which is problematic for some school districts, is reduced by integrating the projector with the interactive whiteboard.\n\nSome manufacturers have provided a unified system where the whiteboards, short throw projection system and audio system are all combined into a single unit which can be set at different heights and enable young children and those in wheelchairs to access all areas of the board. Reduced installation costs make these short-throw projection systems cost effective.\n\nIn most cases, the touch surface must be initially calibrated with the display image. This process involves displaying a sequence of dots or crosses on the touch surface and having the user select these dots either with a stylus or their finger. This process is called alignment, calibration, or orientation. Fixed installations with projectors and boards bolted to roof and wall greatly reduce or eliminate the need to calibrate.\n\nA few interactive whiteboards can automatically detect projected images during a different type of calibration. The technology was developed by Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories Inc and is disclosed in patent 7,001,023. The computer projects a Gray Code sequence of white and black bars on the touch surface and light sensitive sensors behind the touch surface detect the light passing through the touch surface. This sequence allows the computer to align the touch surface with the display; however, it has the disadvantage of having tiny fiber-sized \"dead spots\" in the resistive touch surface where the light sensors are present. The \"dead spots\" are so small that touches in that area are still presented to the computer properly.\n\nAnother system involves having a light sensor built into the projector and facing the screen. As the projector generates its calibration image (a process called \"training\"), it detects the change in light reflected from the black border and the white surface. In this manner it can uniquely compute all the linear matrix transform coefficients.\n\nYet another system includes a camera built into the handheld pen, with human imperceptible targets injected into the image stream sent to the projector or display, containing positioning information, where the camera detects that information and calculates position accordingly, requiring no calibration at all. Such a technology and system is integrated into penveu, and is further disclosed in patent 8,217,997\n\nA variety of accessories is available for interactive whiteboards:\n"}

It passes through the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area at milepost 329; the riparian area makes up a large part of the southern section of the San Pedro Valley.\n\nThe northern terminus of SR 90 is located at an interchange with I-10 west in Benson. It heads south from the interchange and provides access to Kartchner Caverns State Park. It continues south from the state park to a junction with SR 82 north of Huachuca City. It continues towards the south, but curves towards the southeast before passing through Huachuca City. SR 90 continues to the southeast passing through the Fort Huachuca Military Reservation and passes near the Sierra Vista Municipal Airport. The highway turns towards the east as it enters Sierra Vista. It continues to the east along the north side of the city before curving towards the south to a junction with SR 92. As SR 92 continues south from the junction, SR 90 turns towards the east. It continues to the east until curving towards the southeast near the overpass over the San Pedro & South Western Railroad line.

In 1961, the road was extended north, overtaking State Route 92's path to Whetstone and continuing north to Benson, providing easier access to Sierra Vista and Fort Huachuca from the north. This segment was widened to four lanes in the 1990s.\n\nSR 90 has a spur route, logged as two separate sections and located entirely within the city of Sierra Vista. Both sections of the spur are less than and are located near Fort Huachuca.\n\nState Spur Route 90 (1) (SR 90 Spur) is a long spur route of SR 90. The route begins immediately south of SR 90 on Buffalo Soldier Trail. The spur travels north along Buffalo Soldier Trail to a traffic light with SR 90 and the second SR 90 Spur. The second spur begins at the western end of the intersection. The remainder of Buffalo Soldier trail acts as the western edge of Sierra Vista. The road also provides a direct connection to SR 92 and can be used as a bypass of downtown Sierra Vista by SR 90 traffic headed to SR 92.

Tullio Arena) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the downtown area of Erie, Pennsylvania. It is home to the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League and the Erie BayHawks of the NBA G League. It was built in 1983 as part of the Louis J. Tullio Plaza, which also includes the Warner Theatre and UPMC Park – all of which are administered by the Erie County Convention Center Authority. The arena is named for the Erie Insurance Group, which purchased the naming rights in May 2012.\n\nErie Insurance Arena was built for $9.3 million in 1983. It opened in June 1983 with a Beach Boys concert. Since then, it has hosted entertainers including Elton John, Rod Stewart, Cher, KISS, Barry Manilow, Alan Jackson, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and Alice Cooper. Erie Insurance Arena has also featured Disney on Ice, World Wrestling Entertainment, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, the Harlem Globetrotters, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\nIn May 2012, the Erie County Convention Center Authority and the Erie Insurance Group announced a 10-year, $3 million naming agreement that would rename the former Louis J. Tullio Arena, \"Erie Insurance Arena.\" This renaming coincided with the completion of the current $42 million renovation project that was completed in September 2013. The renovation, designed by Friday/Sink Combs Dethlefs Joint Venture Architects, modernized the arena and added some new sections and a landscaped park entrance. Construction on the project was carried out by the Pittsburgh-based Turner Construction Company. Improvements included additional seating and concourses. To accommodate this, its footprint expanded from the original to . This increased the venue's capacity to 6,833 for hockey, 6,754 for basketball and about 9,000 for concerts. Erie Insurance Arena now has enlarged lobbies, more box office windows, luxury suites, administrative offices, mechanical rooms, training areas, new locker rooms, and a club level sponsored by the \"Erie Times-News\". Funding for the renovations derived from $32 million pledged by former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, combined with $10 million paid by Erie County. The arena has hosted numerous high school and college basketball games. Two of the most notable basketball games were between Cathedral Preparatory School and McDowell and local colleges, Gannon University and Mercyhurst University. Both games featured rival schools. Both games generated the most attended high school and college basketball games in city history, both selling out at 5,500.\n\nIn September 2014, the Erie County Convention Center Authority completed a $1.4 million upgrade to the arena which had been dropped from the previous renovation due to a tightened budget. This upgrade included a closed-circuit video system, high-definition video panels on the east and west ends of the arena, and a high-definition \"center ice\" video scoreboard. The new scoreboard replaced the scoreboard added in 2006. The video boards replaced scoreboards from the original construction of the arena in 1983. The new scoreboard and video boards were manufactured by Daktronics.\n\nLouis J. Tullio Arena, in conjunction with Mercyhurst College, hosted the 2011 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament, in which the Wisconsin Badgers defeated the Boston University Terriers in the championship final by a score of 4-1.\n\nErie Insurance Arena, in conjunction with Gannon University, hosted the NCAA Division II Women's Basketball Tournament, in which the Bentley Falcons defeated the West Texas A&M Buffaloes 73–65.\n\nErie Insurance Arena offers conventional food and beverage offerings such as pizza and corn dogs, as well as some more local items such as Greek hot dogs, Greek nachos, and pepperoni balls. The venue offers a separate menu for the floor seats, which includes the shrimp cocktail, spinach artichoke dip, steak burger on a pretzel bun, chicken bacon sandwich, cheesesteak, and a vegetable platter.

The volcano is of the cinder cone (or scoria-cone) type, and is on the northeast corner of the Thadra table mountain in the al Jaww basin, an erosional divide between Harrat ar-Rahah and Harrat al 'Uwayrid. Its eruption history is currently unknown, but geological studies have shown that Hallat al Badr erupted some time during the Holocene period, and the most recent lava flows were in the al Jaww basin. Badr has a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of at least 2, so it is capable of producing an eruption column at least high.\n\nWriters including Charles Beke, Sigmund Freud, Immanuel Velikovsky, Colin HumphreysEduard Meyer, Martin Noth, and Hermann Gunkel have proposed that the biblical description of \"devouring fire\" on Mount Sinai refers to an erupting volcano in the land of biblical Midian. Gunkel writes, \"The characteristic Israelite narratives of Yahweh's appearance in the burning thorn bush (Exod. 3:2), in the burning and smoking Sinai (Exod. 19:9, 20:18; Deut. 4:11), and especially in the pillars of smoke and fire (Exod. 13:21)... can be explained originally from the fact that, in Israel's earliest belief, Yahweh was the god of the Sinai volcano.\" This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai Peninsula and Mount Seir, but would match a number of places in northwestern Saudi Arabia, of which Hala-'l Badr is the most prominent. Beke renounced his theory that Sinai was a volcano when he learned that Mount Baghir (also \"Mountain of Light\"), his volcanic Mount Sinai which was just northeast of the Gulf of Aqaba, was not a volcanic mountain after all.\n\nIn part, Humphreys' argument that Hallat al Badr is Mount Sinai rests on Alois Musils' argument that the itinerary stations given in Numbers 33 lead directly to Badr; he also reports that a volcano in the region erupted in 640 AD, but it is not known exactly which volcano this was. James K. Hoffmeier argues that the route suggested by Humphreys would have put the supposed volcano behind the Israelites at times, not in front. He also notes that the words for \"cloud\" and \"pillar of cloud\" appear frequently in Numbers - it covers the mountain, the temple built on top of the mountain, \"it occupies the holy of holies in Solomon's temple\" and \"Numbers 12:5 specifically refers to God coming down in a pillar of cloud to denounce Miriam's charges against Moses after departing the mountain of God.\" Thus \"fire and cloud are understood to be vessels of theophany.\"\n\n\n"}

It was renamed again to USA Hockey Arena in 2015 when the USA Hockey Foundation purchased the arena.\n\nPeter Karmanos, the President of Compuware and owner of the Detroit Whalers, arranged to build the Whalers a new home as soon as the 1995-96 season ended after playing that season at Oak Park Ice Arena and The Palace of Auburn Hills. The Compuware Sports Arena was constructed in six months time, ready for the 1996–97 season. The team remained the Detroit Whalers after moving to Plymouth Township and then were renamed the Plymouth Whalers in 1997–98.\n\nThe complex features two arenas: the main arena, where the Whalers played their home games, is standard NHL-size and has seating for roughly four thousand people; it also has a larger (in terms of ice area) Olympic-size ice surface, which has much more limited seating (800 seats) on only one side of the ice. The Olympic Arena is the home ice of Detroit Catholic Central High School although they occasionally play games in the main arena when strong attendance is anticipated. The two arenas share concession stands, both of which have openings for both arenas simultaneously, allowing one set of staff to serve both arenas simultaneously. Attached to the complex is \"CJ's Brewing Company\". The arena was home to the now defunct Detroit Ignition, a Major Indoor Soccer League / XSL team, as well as the Compuware Ambassadors minor hockey program. Previously, the arena hosted the now defunct Detroit Rockers of the National Professional Soccer League during its last season in 2000-2001\n\nThe arena also hosts the annual MHSAA high school state championships for boys ice hockey. On October 22, 2006, TNA hosted Bound for Glory (2006) at the arena. During the summer months, the arena's parking lot is home to a drive-in movie theater that features double feature first run movies on three giant screens.

With the success of the Mozilla Firefox, however, demand increased for a mail client to go with it, and the work on Minotaur was revived under the new name of Thunderbird, and migrated to the new toolkit developed by the Firefox team.\n\nSignificant work on Thunderbird restarted with the announcement that from version 1.5 onwards, the main Mozilla suite would be designed around separate applications using this then-new toolkit. This contrasted with the previous all-in-one approach, hopefully leading to more efficient and maintainable code, as well as allowing users to mix and match the Mozilla applications with alternatives.\n\nThe original Thunderbird logo was just a modified Firebird logo, with a simple shifting of hue value from red to blue. In 2004, together with the change of Firefox's visual identity by Jon Hicks, a more professional logo that is currently in use was introduced.\n\nColor chart\nCurrent supported releases\nCurrent test releases\n\nOn 23 December 2004, the Project Lightning was announced for tightly integrating calendar functionality (scheduling, tasks, etc.) into Thunderbird.

An unofficial Eudora/Penelope forum is accessible via web or newsreader.\n\nOn 26 July 2007, the Mozilla Foundation announced that Thunderbird would be developed by an independent organization, because the Mozilla Corporation (the for profit portion of Mozilla) is focusing on Mozilla Firefox development. This change was made in order to stimulate development in Thunderbird, which was being neglected during the Mozilla focus on Firefox.\n\nOn 17 September 2007, the Mozilla Foundation announced the funding of a new internet communications initiative with Dr. David Ascher of ActiveState. The purpose of this initiative is \"to develop Internet communications software based on the Thunderbird product, code and brand\".\n\nOn 19 February 2008, Mozilla Messaging started operations as a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation responsible for the development of email and similar communications. Its initial focus was on the next major version, Thunderbird 3.0, which was released on 8 December 2009.\n\nOn 6 July 2012, the Mozilla Foundation announced that while they will no longer be focused on innovations for Thunderbird, they would provide support until the second half of 2013.

She is a daughter of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Paul Pelosi.\n\nPelosi was born and raised in San Francisco, California. The youngest of five children, she earned a B.A. from Loyola Marymount University. In 1993, she received a master's degree from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nPelosi has produced 12 HBO documentary films with Sheila Nevins.\n\nAfter a decade working in network news, Pelosi made her first film in 2000, while working as a producer for NBC covering George W. Bush's presidential campaign. She brought along a handheld camcorder documenting 18 months of her experience on the campaign trail; the footage was used to create \"Journeys with George\", a documentary that earned her six Emmy nominations.\n\nIn 2001, Sheila Nevins convinced Pelosi to leave network news to work exclusively for HBO. During the 2004 Democratic primaries, Pelosi returned to the campaign trail, this time following the Democratic candidates. Her HBO documentary, \"Diary of a Political Tourist\", was accompanied by her first book \"Sneaking into the Flying Circus: How the Media Turn Our Presidential Campaigns into Freak Shows\", about the process of selecting candidates for President of the United States. She stated that her conversations with Candy Crowley of CNN, Howard Dean, and Wesley Clark inspired her to write a book.\n\nIn 2006, Pelosi created the documentary about evangelical Christians called \"\" which featured former pastor Ted Haggard. After it aired on HBO in 2007, she made a follow-up film, \"The Trials of Ted Haggard\", chronicling the exile of Ted Haggard from New Life Church after his sex and drug scandal, which \"The New York Times\" called \"strangely intriguing\". The LA Times review said, \"this heartbreaking little film that may wind up being the most powerful indictment of homophobia since \"Brokeback Mountain.\"\" \nPelosi went back on the campaign trail in 2008 to document the birth of the Tea Party movement at Republican campaign events for her film, \"\", which premiered on HBO on President's Day 2009.

According to Recode, it's \"a clear-eyed, sober recap of what's been going on...Pelosi's tale is also deeply personal; she grew up in San Francisco, but she has lived in New York for a long time. A key theme of the documentary is that the San Francisco to which she's returning is very different from the one she left.\" Variety called \"San Francisco 2.0\" \"one of her finest.\" San Francisco 2.0 was nominated for an Emmy for best business reporting.\n\nIn 2016, Pelosi made \"\" about money's influence in politics. In a profile in \"Vogue\", Pelosi calls her film a \"light romp into the road map of the people and places that are funding our elections.\" The film drops in on a handful of folks who rank on the OpenSecrets.org list of top donors.\n\nUproxx described it as watching \"Pelosi meet with an assortment of billionaire donors, asking them why they give millions to candidates, how this funding affects campaigns, and all the access these hefty donations can get you.\" On the press tour for the film, Pelosi talked about everything she has learned in her lifetime on the political fundraising circuit\n\n\"The Words That Built America\", Pelosi's eleventh film, premiered on July 4, 2017, narrated by Pulitzer Prize winning David McCullough, is a reading of the U.S. Constitution read by all the living presidents, vice presidents, 50 US senators of both parties, Supreme Court justices, and others.

It closes with middle-school children from the United Nations International School reading the Bill of Rights and summaries of the other amendments. On Anderson Cooper 360, Anderson Cooper talked about hanging out with Pelosi's two sons on the set.\n\nAccording to \"The Port Arthur News\", Pelosi was spotted in Port Arthur filming a new HBO documentary about Trump's America.\n\n\"Outside the Bubble: A Roadtrip\" with Alexandra Pelosi aired on HBO in October 2018. According to IMDB, \"Pelosi sets out on a cross-country trip to engage in conversations with fellow Americans in an effort to gain an unfiltered understanding of other perspectives.\" According to \"The New York Times\",\"It’s not just another episode of the learned cosmopolitan descending from the ivory tower to produce anthropological discourses on that strange creature known as the Trump voter and make it back to the big city in time for a martini. Though she is Democratic royalty, Ms. Pelosi has spent much of her career dissecting, with compassion, the psyche of the political right in America.\"\nIn January 2019, Pelosi debuted \"Goodbye Congress\" on HBO's \"Vice News Tonight\" - the film that features exit interviews with 14 retiring members of Congress, including Speaker Paul Ryan and 7 other Republicans who explain how Washington works.\n\nOn June 18, 2005, in Greenwich Village, she married Dutch journalist, lawyer, and United States correspondent Michiel Vos (born on December 19, 1970 in Groningen, the Netherlands).\n\nIn 2006, Pelosi gave birth to their first child, a boy named Paul, named after his grandfather Paul Pelosi.

They are often photographed with their grandmother Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi often mentions them in speeches. Pelosi says, 'public service runs in the family'. According to Politico, during the battle to repeal Obamacare, Pelosi's 9-year-old grandson Thomas ambled over to reporters in slacks and a blazer and announced, \"It's not going to pass,\" \"He [Paul Ryan] doesn't have the votes!\" In a joint interview on CNN, Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi discussed Ryan's friendship with Pelosi's children. \"I thought you were going to brag about how much my grandchildren are your big fans,\" Pelosi said. \"That's right, her grandkids actually like me, go figure,\" Ryan replied.\n\nAt Spotlight on Alexandra Pelosi at Lincoln Center, Pelosi talked about the solitary life of a documentary filmmaker and how being naive is the best prescription for a documentary filmmaker: \"It feels like every documentary has been made, but it's not true.

{"id": "1890256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890256", "title": "Xenoturbella", "text": "Xenoturbella\n\nXenoturbella is a genus of very simple bilaterians up to a few centimeters long. It contains a small number of marine benthic worm-like species.\n\nThe first known species (\"Xenoturbella bocki\") was discovered in 1915 by Sixten Bock, but it was only properly described in 1949 by Einar Westblad.\n\n\"Xenoturbella\" has a very simple body plan. It consists of dorsoventrally flattened acoelomate animals, with an anterior circumferential furrow. It shows two ciliated epithelial layers: an external epidermis and an internal gastrodermis lining the simple sac-like gut. The multiciliated epiderm displays unique interconnected ciliary rootlets and mode of withdrawal and resorption of worn epidermal cells. The mouth is a mid-ventral pore leading to a gastral cavity, and there is no anus: waste is dispelled through the same opening as food is taken in.\n\nThe nervous system is composed by a net of interconnected neurons beneath the epidermis, without any concentration of neurons forming ganglia or nerve cords.\n\nSpecies of \"Xenoturbella\" also lack a respiratory, circulatory and excretory system. In fact, there are no defined organs, except for an anterior statocyst containing flagellated cells and a frontal pore organ. There are no organized gonads, but gametes are produced. Adults producing sperm are very rarely observed, but eggs and embryos are known to occur in follicles.\n\nEggs of \"Xenoturbella\" are wide, pale orange and opaque. Newly hatched embryos are free-swimming (tending to stay close to water surface) and ciliated. They feature no mouth and they do not apparently feed. They are similar to the juveniles of acoelomate \"Neochildia fusca\".\n\nThe term \"Xenoturbella\" derives from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning \"strange, unusual\", and from the Latin word \"turbella\" meaning \"stir, bustle\". This refers to the enigmatic, unusual taxonomic status of the animal, initially considered as related to turbellarians, a group of flatworms whose aquatic species stir microscopic particles close to their ciliated epidermis.\n\nCurrently the genus \"Xenoturbella\" contains 6 recognized species:\n\nTo date, the genus \"Xenoturbella\" is composed of six species distributed into a shallow-water clade — three species up to — and a deep-water clade — three species deeper than .\n\nThe two smaller species, \"X. bocki\" and \"X. hollandorum\", which are up to long, are found in shallower waters less than deep. They form a clade together with a third species, \"X. japonica\", which is slightly over long and was found in waters less than deep. Three larger species, \"X. monstrosa\", \"X. churro\", and \"X. profunda\", which were or greater long and lived in deeper waters , form another clade. \n\nThe systematic and phylogenetic position of \"Xenoturbella\" among animals has been considered enigmatic since its discovery. An early DNA analysis suggested a close relationship to molluscs, but it was probably a result from contamination with DNA of molluscs that \"Xenoturbella\" consumes.\n\nA subsequent study suggested a placement of the genus in its own phylum, Xenoturbellida, as a deuterostome clade and sister group to the Ambulacraria. The deuterostome affiliations were then recovered by studies that indicate a basal position of this phylum within the deuterostomes or in a sister group relationship with the Ambulacraria.\n\nHowever, morphological characters, such as the structure of epidermal cilia, suggested a close relationship with Acoelomorpha, another problematic group. The study of the embryonic stages of \"Xenoturbella\" also showed that it is a direct developer without a feeding larval stage, and this developmental mode is similar to that of acoelomorphs. Molecular studies based on the concatenation of hundreds of proteins revealed indeed a monophyletic group composed by \"Xenoturbella\" and Acoelomorpha. This clade was named Xenacoelomorpha.\n\nThe monophyly of Xenacoelomorpha soon became established, but its position as either a basal bilaterian clade or a deuterostome remained unresolved until 2016 when two new studies, with increased gene and taxon sampling, again placed \"Xenoturbella\" as the sister group of Acoelomorpha within Xenacoelomorpha, and placed Xenacoelomorpha as sister to Nephrozoa (Protostomia plus Deuterostomia), and therefore the basalmost bilaterian phylum.\n\n\n"}

He was graduated at \"Liceo Torquato Tasso\", and attended to the Sapienza University of Rome until the 1915, when Italy declared war to the Central Powers: in the same year he left his studies to enlist himself in the Italian Royal Army. Wounded in battle, he obtained a Medal of Military Valor after the World War I.\n\nIn 1919, Bottai met Benito Mussolini during a Futurist meeting, and contributed to establish the \"Fasci Italiani di Combattimento\" (\"Italian Fasci of Combat\").\nIn 1921, Bottai ended his studies at law faculty and became a freemason, member of the \"Gran Loggia d'Italia\". At the same time he also started a journalist career in the \"Il Popolo d'Italia\", newspaper of the recently-founded National Fascist Party.\nDuring the March on Rome, Bottai was along with Ulisse Igliori and Gino Calza-Bini, the head of the Roman \"squadrismo\", supporting Blackshirts' political violence.\n\nAfter 1921 election, Bottai was elected in the Chamber of Deputies for the National Blocs, but was removed for his young age. He returned to the Chamber in 1924, maintaining the office until 1943. In 1923, he became leader of the intransigent, national syndicalist and revolutionary faction of the Fascism. To support his ideas, Bottai founded \"Critica fascista\" (\"Fascist Critic\"), a cultural periodical, co-operating with other left-leaning fascists like Filippo De Pisis, Renato Guttuso and Mario Mafai.\n\nBottai worked to the Ministry of Corporations, introducing the Labour Charter and planning a \"Corporative Academic Pole\" in Pisa, from 1926 to 1932, when he was excluded by Mussolini from the Ministry. In 1933, Bottai established and chaired the National Institute of the Social Security (, INPS). After, he was appointed Fascist Governor of Rome (1935–1936) but resigned to fight in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War with the rank of major. In 5 May 1936, Bottai and Pietro Badoglio entered in Addis Abeba, and Bottai was appointed as City Governor. After the war, Bottai returned in Rome to be Education Minister. During his ministry, Bottai proclaimed a law (the so-called \"Bottai Law\") on safeguarding public and cultural heritage and the preservation of natural beauties . He also co-worked with art critics Giulio Carlo Argan and Cesare Brandi to improve the Italian cultural life.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Bottai became more radical and a Germanophile. In 1938 he expressed support to Radical Laws against the Italian Jews and in 1940 he founded \"Primato\" (\"Record\"), a magazine that supported the Aryan race's supremacy and war interventionism. Bottai thought that the \"Fascist Revolution\" was incomplete, and that what was needed was a return to the original, \"pure\" fascism.\n\nHowever, the Italian intervention in World War II resulted in disaster. The Campaign on the Eastern Front caused the death or dispersion of approximately 77,000 soldiers, with more than 39,000 injured. Bottai voted for Mussolini's arrest proposed by Dino Grandi on 25 July 1943, when Italy's defeat became evident. In 1944, the Italian Social Republic condemned Bottai to death, during the Verona trial, but Bottai was hiding in a Roman convent.\n\nIn 1944, Bottai enlisted in the French Foreign Legion, with the pseudodyn Andrea Battaglia. He fought in Provence during the Operation Dragoon and then in the Western Allied invasion of Germany. \n\nAt the war's end, Bottai remained in France, and continued to serve in Foreign Legion until 1948, when he was discharged. For his role in the final stages of World War II, he got an amnesty for his role in Fascism.\n\nReturned in Italy in 1953, Bottai founded the periodical \"ABC\" (not to be confused with the same-name magazine) and \"Il Popolo di Roma\", financed by ex-fascist Vittorio Cini, who supported centrist and conservative views. He died in Rome in 1959. At his funeral participated also Aldo Moro, like his father was a Bottai's friend and assistant during his career.\n\n\n"}

He also inherited the estates of Sir William Lowther, 3rd Baronet, of Marske on 15 April 1756 and the estates of his cousin Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet, of Whitehaven in 1755.\n\nLowther exercised influence over a number of \"rotten\" or \"pocket\" boroughs, including Appleby, a classic example of this type of constituency. In 1761 he was credited with securing the return of eight MPs—two each for Cumberland, Westmorland, and Cockermouth, and one each for Appleby and Carlisle. Later, in 1781, he secured the election of William Pitt the Younger as member for Appleby.\n\nHe married Mary Crichton-Stuart, daughter of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and Mary Wortley-Montagu, 1st Baroness Mount Stuart, on 7 September 1761 and had a string of mistresses. He fell in love with the daughter of one of his tenants and made her his mistress keeping her in luxury. When she died he could not endure to have her buried and the body remained lying in bed until the increasing putrefaction became unbearable. He then had her body placed in a glass topped coffin that was placed in a cupboard. Eventually her body was buried in Paddington cemetery.\n\nHe was created Earl of Lonsdale on 24 May 1784 and Viscount Lowther on 26 October 1797, with special remainder to his third cousin Sir William Lowther, 2nd Baronet, of Little Preston.\n\nOn 9 June 1792 he fought a duel with a Captain Cuthbert of the Guards, when the latter refused to let the former's carriage pass through Mount Street in London where some rioting had been taking place. The Earl asked him if he knew who he was which this led to an unpleasant exchange of words following which the Earl felt obliged to challenge the Captain to a duel the next morning. A pistol ball passed through the flap of Cuthbert's coat but after the exchange of fire both men were unhurt. The matter was concluded with a handshake.\n\nHe was variously known as \"Wicked Jimmy\", the \"Bad Earl\", the \"Gloomy Earl\" and \"Jimmy\" or \"Jemmy Grasp-all, Earl of Toadstool\".\n\nHe died in 1802, having had no children by his wife. His earldom and baronetcy became extinct but he was succeeded as Viscount Lowther, according to the special remainder, by his third cousin William Lowther, 2nd Viscount Lowther, who was later (1807) advanced to Earl of Lonsdale of the second creation. The latter, a coal magnate, also inherited Lowther Castle, which he rebuilt between 1806 and 1814.\n\nLowther had accumulated debts to his solicitor, John Wordsworth, the father of William Wordsworth. Although Wordsworth worked for Lowther, Lowther never paid Wordsworth for his various expenses, which amounted to £4,000 from 1763 until Wordsworth's death in 1783. This debt was finally discharged after his death by his successor.\n\n"}

The monohull sportsboat is notable for its ability to plane over the water downwind in modest winds, and for its combination of a simple design that is highly tunable.\n\nThe Melges 24 has more than 850 boats sold, and is the most popular design produced by Melges Performance Sailboats, a United States company founded by Harry Melges, father of former Olympic sailor Buddy Melges. The boat was designed in 1992 by the Reichel/Pugh design team, and went into production in 1993. Of the nearly nine hundred Melges 24s that have been produced, approximately half were sold in North America with the remainder in Europe, and with fleets in Japan as well.. Fleets are now growing in the Asia Pacific with Northshore Yachts taking the role of building boats for the Australasian Countries. They have built 9 so far with a growing fleet of around 10 Melges 24 in Australia.\n\nThe boat is long and wide at the beam. The fractional rig carries around 1000 square feet (93 m²) of sail area, main, jib and spinnaker combined. Upwind, it has a mainsail and 100% jib. Downwind, it has a large 670 square foot (62 m²) Asymmetrical spinnaker that flies from a retractable bowsprit.\n\nThe boat's hull is made from lightweight fiberglass. The mast, rudder, bowsprit, and keel fin are made from carbon fiber for light weight. The hull is generally flat on the bottom, making it plane easily. The 630 pound (286 kg) keel bulb can retract up to the hull bottom to make it easier to put on a trailer.\n\nThe boat is generally raced with a crew of four or five. Because the boat sails faster with a heavier crew, class rules for racing limit crew weight to 827 pounds (375 kg) total. Unlike most spinnaker-rigged keelboats, the Melges 24 is designed so that no foredeck work is required to fly the spinnaker; it is launched, trimmed, and doused from a launch bag in the pit.\n\nReichel/Pugh also designed other modern Melges boats, including the Melges 17, Melges 32 and Melges 20.\n\n"}

The Adelaide Institute was formed in 1995 from the former Truth Mission that was established in 1994 by Fredrick Töben, later a convicted Holocaust denier. Töben directed the Institute until his incarceration in 2009 in South Australia for contempt of court. Peter Hartung assumed the role of director of the Adelaide Institute. On assuming the role from Töben, Hartung defied the Federal Court by publishing the revisionist material that led to Töben's three months jail time. In June 2009, the Adelaide Institute was linked with an American white supremacist, James von Brunn, charged with killing a security guard in Washington's Holocaust Museum.\n\nTöben and his associates at the Adelaide Institute have denied \"being Holocaust deniers\" in interviews conducted by Australian media, claiming they cannot deny that which never happened. The Institute's stated goal is to expose the myth of the Holocaust.\n\nSupporters of the Institute have in the past been active in organisations such as Australians For Free Speech, which held a rally in 1994. The Institute has also been implicated in distributing Holocaust denialist material through mainstream and alternative publications. Letters to the editor and talk radio appear to be the favourite means of disseminating the worldview of the Institute. Prior to the opening of the film \"Schindler's List\" in Adelaide, members of the institute distributed Holocaust denial pamphlets on the street and through the mail, apparently targeting those of Jewish background. Additionally, members of the Institute sent materials denying the Holocaust to prominent Australian newspapers masquerading as objective movie reviews, some of which reached publication.\n\nThe activity of the Institute appears to have declined since its initial burst of activity in the mid-1990s. The Institute does however still maintain a website on which statements on various issues are posted from time to time.\n\nThe Adelaide Institute website triggered the arrest of Fredrick Töben in Germany in 1998 for breaching Germany's Holocaust Law, Section 130, that outlaws \"Incitement to hatred\". Töben was sentenced in April 1999 to 10 months in prison, but had already served seven months during trial, and was released upon payment of a $5000 bond-Kaution.\n\nThe Institute's website was drawn to the attention of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) in 2000, which ruled in \"Jones v Toben\" [2000] HREOCA 39 that a person contravenes section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act when they refer to the treatment of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s as having been \"mythologised\". The HREOC found that the Adelaide Institute had breached section 18C by publishing material on the website the consequences of which were \"vilificatory, bullying, insulting and offensive\" to the Jewish population, and ordered Töben to close the site and apologise to the people he had offended.\n\nAs rulings of the HREOC are not enforceable at law, the case went to the Federal Court of Australia to enforce the Commission's decision. The Court ordered in 2002 that Töben remove from the Adelaide Institute website any material which conveys one or any of the following imputations:\n\n\nIn \"Toben v Jones\" (2003) 129 FCR 515, [2003] FCAFC 137, the Full Court of the Federal Court dismissed an appeal from those orders, in which Töben challenged the constitutional validity of section 18C.\n\nElectronic Frontiers Australia spoke out against the ruling, taking the view that \"when encountering racist or hateful speech, the best remedy to be applied is generally more speech, not enforced silence.\" One of the reasons mentioned is that suppressing such content results in perception that the speaker must have something important to say, and \"massively increased interest in what would otherwise be marginal ideas.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Whilst Cumbernauld was designated a new town in 1955, the Village itself has a pre-mediaeval history, with a Roman settlement being built in the area due to its proximity to the Antonine Wall. After the Roman period the settlement remained and grew to such an extent that the Comyn family built their chapel there. It is recorded that, in 1500, the Black Death led to a special plea from the surviving people of Cumbernauld to the church authorities in Glasgow to allow them to establish their own cemetery rather than taking all their dead to St. Ninian's in Kirkintilloch. This source is also quoted in \"Excavations at 3-11 Main Street, Cumbernauld\". The villagers were granted permission to do so, and used the ground at the existing Comyns' chapel which dates from the end of the 12th century. Farming in long strips or Lang Riggs was carried out in the village.\n\nThe Flemings (who would become the Earls of Wigtown) later took over the Comyns' castle in Cumbernauld. In the 18th century this was replaced by Cumbernauld House\n\nBy the Seventeenth century the main industry of the Village was hand loom weaving, but this subsequently changed as due to the village's proximity to the Forth and Clyde canal and rich source of natural minerals and stone it became a site of mining and quarrying. The Village was also the site of a number of tenant held farms on the Flemings' estate. The 19th century Groome's Gazetteer states that Cumbernauld is:\n\nCumbernauld had one of the oldest curling societies in the world which was established in the 18th century. The curling pond was near the Spur Inn, on the other side of the Bog Stank to the village.\n\nOctober 1878 was a difficult time locally made worse by the failure of the Bank of Glasgow in which much of the village's money was invested. As the mining industry declined the village was further boosted by the decision to site a new town in the vicinity, with Cumbernauld lending its name to this new town.\n\nToday, Cumbernauld Village is quite characteristically different from most of the rest of the town, as it contains a high number of local amenities, and its structure of having pavements beside the roads in the Village is quite unlike the rest of the planned new town, with the possible exception of Condorrat which, like Cumbernauld Village, is a settlement of many years' standing before the new town's construction.\n\nCumbernauld Village has an active local community and local people are involved in the Village Community Council and in Cumbernauld Village Action for the Community. The latter is a community group campaigning for improvements to the amenity of the Village.\n\nCumbernauld's non-league (junior) football team, Cumbernauld United, play in the Village at Guy's Meadow. Cumbernauld United also have a full youth academy with teams at all age groups from under 6 upwards, considered by many as one of the best in Central Scotland.

He has had much success crossing over into the American comic book market. Primarily working for Marvel Comics, Jenkins had a big part shaping the characters of the company, helping via the Marvel Knights imprint to propel Marvel from Chapter 11 bankruptcy before choosing to focus on independent publications. He is also noted for his groundbreaking narrative work in the field of video games, and is recognized as one of the world's preeminent \"cross-media\" creators for his work across such multiple media as animation, video games, comic books, and film.\n\nDespite his commercial success, Jenkins is a noted advocate for creators' rights thanks in part to his early days at Mirage Studios and Tundra Publishing, where he witnessed first hand the drafting of the Creators Bill of Rights. He has spoken frequently in support of mentoring, and the need for hands-on education in the entertainment industry.\n\nCurrently, Jenkins is the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of META Studios, Atlanta's only cross-media development and production house. \n\nHis current projects include Commissioner Gordon and Black Adam with DC Comics. He is also working on the upcoming fan film inspired by Star Trek, Axanar.\n\nPaul Jenkins was raised by a single parent in the West Country of his native United Kingdom. He gained his first writing and directing experience while studying for his degree in acting. Jenkins moved to the United States in 1987, where he first taught music and drama to learning-disabled children before embarking on a successful career in the entertainment industry.\n\nAfter moving to the US, he joined Mirage Studios in 1988, where he worked as editor/production manager. He edited Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's books, including \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", and even negotiated their licensing deals. Seeing the TMNT were fully owned and controlled by Eastman and Laird, Jenkins gained an important understanding of the benefits of cross-media development and ancillary exploitation.\n\nLeaving Mirage, Jenkins followed Eastman to Tundra Publishing - another Eastman publishing venture - where he became Editor-in-Chief at the age of 24. His duties also included heading the production and licensing departments. During this time, Jenkins edited such notable comics creators as Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean, and George Pratt. This was followed by stints as Editor-in-Chief at Majestic Entertainment and the short-lived Scoreboard Comics.\n\nTired of editing, Jenkins pitched to several companies as a writer. Despite minimal writing experience, he journeyed to San Diego Comicon where he approached DC Comics' Vertigo editor Lou Stathis and pitched for the prestigious gig as writer of \"Hellblazer\". In 1994, with no previous mainstream credits to his name, he took over as writer of \"Hellblazer\", and began what would go on to be a five-year-long stint. His work on this title gained him attention in the American comic industry, and as of January 2016, his complete run has been collected.\n\nPaul's Marvel Comics career began in 1997, when he worked on reviving some of the company's horror-themed properties. He relaunched the psychological horror title \"Werewolf By Night\", writing six issues, until the title was canceled to start the anthology title \"Strange Tales\", the first two issues of which printed the rest of his \"Werewolf By Night\" story.\n\nLater in the year, he and artist Jae Lee were responsible for launching the critically acclaimed and commercially successful Marvel Knights series \"Inhumans\". The limited series ran twelve issues between November 1998 and October 1999, and earned Jenkins an Eisner Award.\n\nIn 2000, Jenkins and Lee followed up their collaboration with another five issue Marvel Knights limited series, this time concerning The Sentry, a series Jenkins had unsuccessfully pitched to Marvel and DC Comics for a number of years. Although the mentally tortured hero was an original creation of Jenkins', Marvel ran a marketing hoax claiming that the character was a long-lost Silver Age creation of Stan Lee himself, even pre-dating the Fantastic Four. Several years later, Brian Michael Bendis reused the Sentry by making him a member of the New Avengers : Jenkins himself was featured as a character in the storyline which reintroduced the Sentry. Also in 2000, Jenkins given writing assignments in the mainstream Marvel Universe. In March, he was made the regular writer on \"The Incredible Hulk\". Like in much of his earlier work, Jenkins conducted a psychiatric examination of Bruce Banner, including a look at Banner's multiple Hulk personas. His 20 issue run on \"The Incredible Hulk\" ran until November 2001. During this same period, Jenkins became the regular writer of \"\". Taking over the title from issue 20, in August 2000, he wrote it until its end in August 2003. Marvel placed him on \"The Spectacular Spider-Man\" Vol.2, which Jenkins wrote for most of its three-year run, which paired him with artist Humberto Ramos.\n\nIn 2001 he collaborated with penciller Andy Kubert on the six-issue limited series \"Origin\", which for the first time revealed the details of Wolverine's childhood and early life. The title was one of the biggest sales successes of that year for Marvel. Jenkins later wrote \"\", a story addressing plot threads begun in \"Origin\", although it is not a direct sequel, as Marvel's \"The End\" stories are not canon.\n\nJenkins later wrote \"Wolverine\" for Marvel, and \"The Darkness\" for Top Cow. Another project undertaken by Jenkins for Marvel was the \"Mythos\" series of one-shots where Jenkins, with Paolo Rivera's painted artwork, would retell the origin stories of Marvel's movie adapted characters to bridge the gap between the movie and the comic book versions of the characters.\n\nIn 2005 Jenkins wrote the Dark Horse Comics six issue miniseries \"Revelations\", illustrated by Ramos, and Marvel's \"The Sentry\" with artist John Romita Jr.. In 2006 he wrote his own independent comic, \"Sidekick\", published by Image Comics. That same year, he wrote \"\", a tie-in to Marvel's crossover storyline, \"Civil War\" that depicted the transformation of Robbie Baldwin from Speedball to Penance, was expanded on in the limited series \"Penance: Relentless\". It also led to \"World War Hulk: Front Line\". He also took over the writing on \"Son of Hulk\" when it lost its focus on Skaar, the series ran from No. 13 to 17.\n\nJenkins has worked on several video games including the \"Legacy of Kain\", \"Prototype\", \"Twisted Metal Black\" and \"God of War\" series. Most recently, Paul is credited as writer on \"\", created with Radical Entertainment, \"The Darkness\", created by Starbreeze Studios, and \"The Darkness 2\" by Digital Extremes.\n\nHe made his return to DC Comics in 2011, taking a big part in the New 52 initiative, include writing stints on \"DC Universe Presents\" featuring the character of Deadman; \"\" with artist David Finch, and a two-issue fill-in arc on \"Stormwatch\".\n\nIn February 2013 Paul Jenkins left DC and Marvel to work with Boom! Studios. Jenkins launched \"Deathmatch\" with Carlos Magno and \"Fairy Quest\" with Humberto Ramos, and brought \"Revelations\" from Dark Horse to Boom!\n\nIn 2014, Jenkins founded META Studios, Atlanta's only cross-media development and production house. META Studios works directly in the creation of nearly all existing media, from graphic novels and books, to film & television, animation, videogames (console & mobile), and virtual, augmented, and variable reality.\n\nIn 2015, Jenkins subsequently moved on to work with Aftershock Comics where he created the comic series \"Replica\". This was followed by the ongoing series \"Alters\", which focuses on various disadvantaged heroes with mutant powers known as \"alterations.\"\n\nIn 2015, Jenkins was asked by Georgia Governor Nathan Deal to assemble and chair an advisory committee to educate the Georgia General Assembly on the evolution of digital and interactive technologies.\n\nIn 2016, Jenkins created the transgender superhero Chalice for the \"Alters\" comic book series.\n\nJenkins' current projects include Commissioner Gordon and Black Adam with DC Comics.

Opened on 24 February 1914, it was India's first sea bridge, and was the longest sea bridge in India until the opening of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in 2010. The rail bridge is, for the most part, a conventional bridge resting on concrete piers, but has a double-leaf bascule section midway, which can be raised to let ships and barges pass through. Until 1988, the Pamban bridge was the only surface transport that connected Tamil Nadu's island of Rameswaram to the mainland. In Dec-2018, the bascule of this bridge was damaged, which suspended the transportation on the bridge for 3 months. Rail movement was again restored on 27th Feb 2019.\n\nIn 1988, a road bridge was also constructed parallel to the rail bridge. This road bridge is also known as Indira Gandhi Road Bridge. The Pamban Road Bridge connects the National Highway (NH 49) with the Rameswaram island. It stands on the Palk Strait and between the shores of Mandapam (a place on the Indian mainland) and Pamban (one of the fishermen town in Rameswaram island). It was inaugurated by former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on 2 October 1988. This 2.345 km long Bridge took close to 14 years to be completed.\n\nThe Pamban railway bridge spans a 2.065 km strait between the Indian mainland and Pamban island. The mainland end of the bridge is located at . The bridge is located in the world's second most corrosive environment after Florida, making its maintenance a challenging job. The location is also a cyclone-prone high wind velocity zone.\n\nThe railway bridge is located above sea level and is long. The bridge consists of 143 piers and has a double-leaf bascule section with a Scherzer rolling type lift span that can be raised to let ships pass. Each half of the lifting span weighs . The two leaves of the bridge are opened manually using levers.\n\nPlans for a bridge to connect to mainland was suggested in 1870 as the British Administration sought ways to increase trade with Ceylon. The construction began in August 1911 and was opened on 24 February 1914. The adjacent road bridge was opened in 1988. As of 5 December 2018, the bridge was closed due to a crack in the bridge and the maintenance work is going on. The Indian Railway Minister Piyush Goyal announced that a new railway bridge will be constructed near the old Pamban Bridge at a cost of Rs. 250 crores. This new dual track bridge is planned to be constructed in automotive mode, allowing two ships to pass this bridge at the same time.\n\nThe bridge was damaged during the 1964 Rameswaram cyclone and required repair work. Strengthening work was carried out on the bridge under the supervision of E. Sreedharan in 2009 to enable it to carry goods trains. On 13 January 2013, the bridge required repair work to the piers after suffering minor damage from a naval barge. In 2016, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned to replace the existing long rolling type span with a long single truss span which could be opened automatically. All train movement was stopped from 5 December 2018 when a fissure was noticed on 4 December 2018.\n\nRail movement on the bridge is restored as of 10 March 2019.\nThe railway bridge carried metre gauge trains connecting Mandapam on mainland India to Pamban. Indian Railways upgraded the bridge to carry broad gauge trains and the work was completed on 12 August 2007. From Pamban, the railway line bifurcated, one line towards Rameshwaram about up and another branch line of terminating at Dhanushkodi. The Boat mail express runs from Chennai Egmore to Rameswaram. The train ran up to Dhanushkodi until 1964 when the metre-gauge branch line from Pamban to Dhanushkodi was destroyed during the 1964 Dhanushkodi cyclone.\n\nThe construction works of Pamban Road bridge was commenced on 17 November 1974 by the Indian Highway department and contracted to M/S Neelakandan Brothers Engs, Madras.\nAfter the 1978 cyclone the work was carried out slowly, and few years later the contract was given to the New Gammon India Ltd. The Government sanctioned 16.6514 crore INR by 1986. The work was completed on 1988.\n\nOn 23 December 1964, an estimated storm surge struck the island, overturning the Pamban-Dhanuskodi passenger train killing all 150 passengers on board. On 13 January 2013, the bridge suffered minor damage when a naval barge drifted into it.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1890444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890444", "title": "List of Viking metal bands", "text": "List of Viking metal bands\n\nThis is a list of Viking metal bands. Viking metal is a style of heavy metal music with origins in black metal and Nordic folk music, characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than genre, but it is typically manifested as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both clean and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect.\n\nViking metal emerged during the late-1980s through the mid-1990s as a rejection of Satanism and the occult, instead embracing the Vikings and paganism as the leaders of opposition to Christianity. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings.\n\nThough artists such as Led Zeppelin, Yngwie Malmsteen, Heavy Load, and Manowar have previously dealt with Viking themes, Bathory from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums \"Blood Fire Death\" (1988) and \"Hammerheart\" (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. Enslaved, from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with \"Hordanes Land\" (1993) and \"Vikingligr Veldi\" (1994). Burzum, Emperor, Einherjer, and Helheim, among others, helped further develop the genre in the early through mid-1990s. Through the work of artists such as the German project Falkenbach, Viking metal soon spread from the Nordic countries to other nations with Viking history or an even broader Germanic heritage, and has since influenced musicians across the globe. The death metal bands Unleashed and Amon Amarth, which emerged in the early 1990s, also adopted Viking themes, broadening the style from its primarily black metal origin.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890447", "title": "Gun Carrier Mark I", "text": "Gun Carrier Mark I\n\nThe Gun Carrier Mark I was a British vehicle of the First World War. The gun carrier was designed to transport a 6-inch howitzer or a 60-pounder gun forward soon after an attack to support infantry in advanced positions. Gun carriers were first used in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July – 2 August 1917) during the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917). The carriers moved guns and equipment but were used for the rest of the war mainly for carrying equipment and supplies through areas under fire, where porters in the open would have suffered many casualties. The 6-inch howitzer could be fired while mounted, making the Gun Carrier Mark I the first modern self-propelled gun, a weapon capable of independent action and having tactical mobility on the battlefield.\n\nIn early 1916, the tactical conditions on the Western Front could leave infantry who had captured positions exhausted, disorganised, short of supplies, out of touch with the rear and incapable of defeating a counter-attack. Allied artillery was being moved by tractor and an armoured, tracked vehicle would allow artillery to be moved in areas under German fire. Major John Greg, an engineer working for Metropolitan, Carriage, Wagon and Finance, proposed to build special mechanised artillery, using parts of the Tank Mark I. Greg began work on a design with Major Walter Wilson, an inventor who had worked on the Tank Mark I, on 7 March.. At first, carriage of the BL 6-inch howitzer, 8-inch howitzer or the 60-pounder gun (5-inch) was envisaged but the idea of transporting the 8-inch howitzer was dropped. On 3 March 1917, the prototype was tested at Oldbury with other experimental vehicles at a Tank Trials Day.\n\nThe prototype Gun Carrier Mark I (War Department serial number \"GC\" 100) was long, and included a Tank Mark I steering tail; with the tail and carrying a gun, the equipment was long. The vehicle was wide and high. The gun carrier moved on tracks wide and about high. The empty weight was and the vehicle was propelled by a Daimler engine The vehicle had a Tank Mark I transmission of a primary gearbox with two forward and one reverse gear; there were two-speed secondary gears for each track. The gun carrier was operated by a commander, driver and two gearsmen. An armoured box enclosed the rear half of the vehicle, overhanging the tracks which ran through a gap. The front half of the machine had a platform for a gun with two armoured cabs, one for the driver and one for the commander, above the tracks at the front on each side.\nThe vehicle had an endurance of about eleven hours, with a top speed of on flat ground and could cross trenches up to wide. There was no room for track spuds to be attached and in tests, it was found that mud and debris clogged the track runs, pierced the superstructure and holed the radiators above them. A 6-inch howitzer or a 60-pounder gun could be winched backwards onto the gun platform at the front and secured, the wheels being removed and hung over the sides of the gun carrier. Sixty rounds of ammunition were carried for either gun bringing the weight to for the 6-inch howitzer and for the 60-pounder. The armoured box at the back accommodated an eight-man gun crew and each vehicle carried a machine-gun.\n\nWork by Greg and Wilson began on 7 March 1916 but only with GHQ approval, which was received on 17 May 1916. The Ordnance Board refused to approve the design on 15 June 1916 and Albert Stern, the Secretary of the Landship Committee appealed to David Lloyd George, the Minister of Munitions. Lloyd George over-ruled the Board and unilaterally placed an order for fifty vehicles the next day. On 29 May 1917 the War Office ordered\n\nThe prototype was built by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon & Finance Co. and was finished on 1 January 1917. An order was placed with Kitson & Co. in Leeds for 49 gun carriers (changed to 47 gun carriers and two salvage vehicles on 16 October 1917). Trials of the prototype began around 2 February 1917 and at Shoeburyness ranges the 60-pounder was fired from the carrier. Six gun carriers and the two salvage vehicles were delivered to the army in the second quarter of 1917, the third quarter, the fourth quarter and the last five in the first quarter of 1918 at a price of £168,000 for the carriers and £10,000 for the two salvage vehicles.\n\nThe two forward driving cabs were removed, the carrying platform was covered and a hand-crane to lift -loads on a jib or using shear legs. The box had a cab in front, behind which was a winding drum connected to the engine for hauling with a wire hawser; the price of the two vehicles was £10,000. In December a third vehicle was equipped with a Priestman Brothers clamshell steam-grab. David Fletcher suggests this was the track chassis of the prototype Gun Carrier \n\nA revised Gun Carrier Mark II was designed but only a mock-up was built. The hull covered two-thirds of the length of the vehicle and the carrying platform was moved to the back. The front end was built on similar lines to Tank Marks IV and V, with the tracks raised at the front for climbing obstacles. The vehicle was to be powered by a 150-hp Ricardo engine through epicyclic gears. Guns would be embarked at the rear and retain their wheels but not fire from the vehicle.\n\nGun Carrier arrived in France before the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917) and was attached to XVIII Corps for field trials. The gun carrier was first used at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July – 2 August 1917) and the steering tail was soon dispensed with. During the fighting in Flanders, the carrier brought several hundred tons of ammunition and several 60-pounder guns forward. On at least one occasion, a 6-inch howitzer was fired from which then changed position to confuse the Germans. The 1st Gun Carrier Company was formed on 6 September and greatly eased the task of moving supplies, each carrier moving loads of which would have needed a carrying party of By the end of the year carriers were in France. As supply tanks, the gun carriers had much greater capacity than converted Mark I and Mark IV tanks and were in constant demand. Seven gun carriers were available for the opening of the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November 1917.\n\nIn June 1918, the two gun carrier companies were converted to supply companies and attached to the 3rd and 5th Tank Brigades. At the Battle of Hamel (4 July 1918), Captain James Smith led the four machines of the 1st Gun Carrier Company forward with of engineer stores to within of the final objective, within thirty minutes of its capture. As the vehicles returned the crews picked up seventy wounded soldiers and transported them to a dressing station. Four officers and sixteen men transported the equivalent of the equivalent of about two infantry battalions' worth of stores and equipment. One gun carrier moved of barbed wire, pickets, sheets, fifty tins of water, bombs, of ammunition and twenty boxes of hand grenades. When the 1st and 2nd Supply companies reached France, they joined the 1st and 4th Tank Brigades and the 3rd, 4th and 5th Supply companies were posted to Blingel Camp, near Bermicourt which had driving and maintenance facilities. In late July the 3rd and 5th Supply companies were re-equipped with Mark IV supply tanks and Mark IVs with fitments to haul sledges full of supplies. By August the 1st Gun Carrier Company was attached to the 5th Tank Brigade and the 2nd Company to the 3rd Tank Brigade.\n\nThe carriers of the 1st Gun Carrier Company were allotted to the Australian Corps during the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August 1918). On the night of the 1st Gun Carrier Company drove to an orchard on the west of Villers-Bretonneux carrying explosives. A shell from a German battery near Chipilly ignited a camouflage net on one of the carriers, thick smoke rose and German artillery bombarded the orchard. The vehicle crews and some Australian gunners rescued three carriers which were driven out of danger but the rest exploded; Major W. Partington, commander of the 1st Gun Carrier Company was wounded. When not needed for tank support, the gun carriers shifted engineer stores and ammunition for the infantry, being of great use in areas swept by machine-gun fire. The 2nd Gun Carrier Company carried forward a 6-inch howitzer to conduct harassing fire at night, moving around to deceive the Germans. Several gas attacks were carried out by gun carriers moving Livens projectors and gas bombs over ground too cut up for wheeled vehicles. The cross-country mobility of the gun carriers enabled more bombs to be fired in the dark and the carriers to vacate the area before dawn. For the remainder of the war, gun carriers were in great demand to carry tank supplies over ground unfit for wheeled vehicles. On 18 September, during the Hundred Days Offensive, Australian infantry were so understrength during operations against the Hindenburg outpost-line, that two gun carriers moved supplies to the first objective. Eleven days later, the 5th Tank Supply Company, with supported the Australian Corps at the Hindenburg Line.\n\nOnce the gun had been winched aboard and fixed to a cross beam, it was near its usual firing position. In a 2013 publication, John Glanfield described the vehicle as a \"dual self-propelled gun/gun carrier\". The vehicle had been designed for the 6-inch howitzer, which could be fired from the vehicle and the 60-pounder Mk II, none of which were in France in 1917 and the Mk I had to be disembarked to fire. As supply vehicles, the gun carriers excelled, being able to carry a heavy load on the platform, rather than inconveniently placed inside a converted tank.\n\nBooks\n\nTheses\n\n"}

Glover. He describes what he calls the \"Nice guy Syndrome\", a condition in men who appear to be always nice and who try to avoid conflict at all costs.\n\nGlover's premise is that nice guys have been conditioned by their childhoods and by society to believe that they will be successful only if they make everyone happy and never cause any problems for others. However, this desire for approval results in self-loathing. In other words, nice guys want approval, but don't think they deserve it. This creates internal frustration, since nice guys never try to obtain what they want in life. In addition, the nice guy's desire to obtain approval from everyone (especially women), often causes him to actually behave in very \"un\"-\"nice\" ways. This includes dishonesty (about themselves), passive-aggressive behavior, and inauthenticity. \n\nDr. Glover's prescription involves getting nice guys to recognize that their needs and desires are important, and that to make others happy they must first learn to make themselves happy. One of the primary ways advised in the book to remedy this is for nice guys to learn to embrace and develop their masculine traits, instead of fearing and suppressing them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890466", "title": "Paul Jenkins (painter)", "text": "Paul Jenkins (painter)\n\nPaul Jenkins (July 12, 1923 – June 9, 2012) was an American abstract expressionist painter.\n\nWilliam Paul Jenkins (known as Paul Jenkins) was born in 1923 in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was raised. He met Frank Lloyd Wright who was commissioned by the artist's great-uncle, the Rev. Burris Jenkins (whose own motto was to \"live dangerously\") to rebuild his church in Kansas City, Missouri after a fire. (Wright suggested that Jenkins should think about a career in agriculture rather than art.) The young Jenkins also visited Thomas Hart Benton and confided his intention to become a painter. The Eastern art collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum (then, the William Rockhill Nelson Art Gallery) had an early influence on him.\n\nIn his teenage years, Jenkins moved to Struthers, Ohio to live with his mother, Nadyne Herrick, and stepfather, who both ran the local newspaper, the Hometown Journal (then the Struthers Journal). After graduating from Struthers High School, he served in the U.S. Maritime Service and entered the U.S. Naval Air Corps during World War II. In 1948, he moved to New York City where, on the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Art Students League of New York with Yasuo Kuniyoshi for four years, and with Morris Kantor. During that time, he met Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and Barnett Newman. In 1953, he traveled to Europe, working for three months in Taormina in Sicily before settling in Paris, France. From 1955 on, the artist shared his time between New York and Paris.\n\nIn 1953, after studying with Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Art Students League of New York, Jenkins traveled to Italy and Spain, settling in Paris where his first solo exhibition took place in 1954 at Studio on the rue de Lille. , with the help of Alfonso Ossorio, held in 1952, an exhibition of the work of Jackson Pollock in his gallery, which was well known for showing works by abstract artists of the time, among others.\n\nJenkins' first solo exhibition in the US took place in 1954 at the pioneering gallery of Zoe Dusanne in Seattle. His first solo exhibition in New York was held in 1956 at the Martha Jackson Gallery, a leading gallery of the time. The Whitney Museum of American Art in New York purchased the painting \"Divining Rod\" from this exhibition. In the '50s, Jenkins achieved prominence both in New York and Europe for his early abstractions. At the Gutai exhibition held at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York in 1958, Jenkins is invited by Jiro Yoshihara to work with Gutai in Osaka; however, Jenkins waited until 1964 to implement this invitation.\n\nFrom the artist's studio in Paris in 1959, Peggy Guggenheim purchased \"Osage,\" a work on canvas, and continued to later purchase the artist's work.\n\nJenkins continued to experiment with flowing paints, pouring pigment in streams of various thicknesses, with white linear overlays.\n\nJenkins, described as an abstract expressionist, would at times call himself \"an abstract phenomenist.\" His early works were made in oil on primed canvas, as he continued working on paper with ink and with watercolor. In 1959 and 1960, he explored the writings of Goethe and Kant. Influenced by Goethe's color theories, he began to preface the titles of his works with the word \"Phenomena\" followed by a key word or phrase. Regarding his paintings, he once said, \"I have conversations with them, and they tell me what they want to be called.\"\n\nGradually in 1960 he moved away from working in oil on canvas to acrylic. Jenkins began to paint using an ivory knife, a key tool in the creation of his work:\n\nThe art historian Albert E. Elsen has noted: \"Jenkins was not staining his canvas, because of the sizing and priming.\"\n\nThroughout the 60s, his work was shown worldwide, at major galleries and museums in Tokyo, London, New York, Paris, Amsterdam and elsewhere. In 1963, he took over Willem de Kooning's light-infused loft at Union Square in New York City where he worked until the end of 2000.\n\nIn 1964, he traveled to Tokyo for his exhibition at the Tokyo Gallery and worked with Gutai in Osaka. Gutai works in Jenkins' collection are later shown in a 2009 exhibition curated by Ming Tiampo at the Pollock-Krasner House & Study Center in The Springs, East Hampton, then traveling to The Harold B. Lemmerman Gallery, New Jersey City University. In 2010, this exhibition traveled to UB Anderson Gallery of the State University of New York Buffalo.\n\n\"The Ivory Knife\", a film by the Martha Jackson Gallery and Red Parrot, receives the Golden Eagle Award at the 1966 Venice Film Festival and is shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His play, \"Strike the Puma\", is published by Editions Gonthier in 1966, and in 1968 is performed off Broadway in New York City.\n\nDuring this time, Harry Abrams decides against including what the artist called his \"black and white photo montages\" in the forthcoming monograph then in preparation and published in 1973 with text by the late art historian Albert E. Elsen. Fragments of these autobiographical montages are later integrated into expanded collages that form \"Anatomy of a Cloud\", published by Harry N. Abrams in 1983.\n\nIn 1968, Jenkins began the creation of a limited number of solid and unique sculptures in glass with Egidio Costantini in Murano. Several of these works were shown in the 2007 exhibition \"Viva Vetro! Glass Alive! Venice and America\", 1950-2006.\n\nSculpture, already present in the artist's life in the 1950s, comes to the forefront with a series of works. In 1971, invited by Philip Pavia to participate in the Sculptors' Symposium held at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, Jenkins carves a 2-ton block of French limestone currently in the collection of the Hofstra Museum Sculpture Garden in Hempstead, New York. In this decade, the artist creates the first drawing for Meditation Mandala, a sculpture project for a park. \"Meditation Mandala\" is then cast in bronze, together with the sculptures \"Shakti Samothrace\", \"Excalibur\" and \"Echo Chamber\".\n\nCollages, a little known aspect of the artist's work, begin to come into view. Prior to publication of \"Anatomy of a Cloud\" in 1983 by Harry N. Abrams, the artist's collages were largely unknown. A notable exception is the 1978 exhibition at the Gimpel Weitzenhoffer Gallery in New York, which integrated sculptural elements with collage. Yet, as early as the mid-fifties, visitors to the artist's Paris studio could see abstract collaged interior doors, as well as an inner wall later called Hokusai Arch, consisting of collaged Japanese woodcuts.\n\nIn 1971-1972 a retrospective of works on canvas organized by Gerald Nordland and Philippe de Montebello took place at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the San Francisco Museum of Art. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. initiates an exhibition of his watercolors which traveled across the US for two years.\n\nIn 1977, he begins to work in watercolor and on canvas in St. Croix in the Caribbean and is strongly influenced by the physicality of working outside, reminiscent of Taormina where he was confronted by color in a direct and decisive way. Jenkins gained a level of notoriety when his paintings appeared in the Academy Award-nominated 1978 movie \"An Unmarried Woman\" directed by Paul Mazursky. (People Magazine, June 19, 1978). In 1979, during a long stay in the Caribbean, impasto begins to appear in Jenkins' paintings and he completes \"Phenomena Forcing a Passage at the Mark\", a decisive painting to him in discovering the scraped veils with prism concentrates.\n\nAs he pursued working in acrylic and in watercolor, Jenkins began to build full-scale elements of the \"Meditation Mandala\" sculpture in steel at the Shidoni Foundry in Tesuque, New Mexico; these elements are later installed in the Sculpture Garden of the Hofstra Museum. At Shidoni Foundry, he also casts a unique sculpture in bronze, \"Four Corners\".\nIn 1987, through the initiative of Jean-Louis Martinoty, the Paris Opera stages \"Shaman to the Prism Seen\", a dance-drama written by Jenkins retracing the passage of colors through the prism. Jenkins paints two canvases 30 x 40 feet each for the stage set, together with vertical paintings on canvas as sentinel elements for the stage, as well as costumes and silks, and creates a sculptural prism dais for Shaman.\n\nDuring the preparation of his monograph \"Anatomy of a Cloud\", Jenkins creates collages in honor of the French theatre director and actor, Jean-Louis Barrault. These collages are shown at the French Cultural Services of the French Embassy in New York. At Barrault's request, these works travel to the theatre of the Renaud-Barrault Company, Le Théâtre du Rond-Point in Paris, to inaugurate La Maison Internationale du Théâtre, whose insignia is created from a work by the artist.\n\nThe director, Alan Schneider, enters \"Anatomy of a Cloud\" into his workshop of actors at the University of California, San Diego. Jenkins begins to use granular poured veils on scraped prism forms; abstract collage elements integrate themselves in the works on canvas.\n\n\"Anatomy of a Cloud\", an autobiographical book of what the artist calls \"word impressions\" and collages, is published by Harry N. Abrams in New York in 1983 and receives the silver medal from the Art Directors Club of New York.\n\nIn 1990, invited by Abba Eban, Jenkins traveled to Israel and the following year to Japan and to Italy. In Paris, he created a series of original lithographs on stone entitled, \"Seven Aspects of Amadeus and the Others\". In 1991, Jenkins' Polyptychs on canvas entitled, \"Conjunctions and Annexes\" are shown in New York at the Gimpel Weitzenhoffer Gallery; a book of the same title is published with a text by Pascal Bonafoux.\n\nIn 1994, \"Water and Color/L'Eau et la Couleur\", an exhibition of his watercolors, was initiated by PACA in Angers and traveled throughout France for two years.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Steel elements of \"Meditation Mandala\" made by the artist at the Shidoni Foundry in New Mexico were installed in the sculpture garden of Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY.\n\nIn 1999, the Hofstra Museum held an exhibition of the artist's works on canvas from 1954-1960 in New York and Paris.\n\nIn 2000, the Butler Institute of American Art in Ohio exhibited Jenkins' works on paper from the exhibition, \"Water and Color\".\n\nIn 2003 Jenkins began to exhibit with the Redfern Gallery in London. In 2005, he created specific works on canvas in \"New York for As Above So Below\", a temporary installation at the Silvacane Abbey, a 12th-century Cistercian abbey in La Roque-d'Anthéron, near Aix-en-Provence. In 2005, \"Œuvres Majeure\"s, an exhibition of works on canvas together with watercolors, was shown at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Lille in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, 2008, and 2009, Jenkins donated around 5,000 pieces from his archive to the Archives of American Art of the Smithsonian Institution, then his personal papers.\n\nIn 2010, the new Crocker Art Museum building exhibited, \"Paul Jenkins: The Color of Light\", 50 watercolors including large-scale and works originally created in conjunction with his dance-drama performed at the Paris Opera, together with selected paintings on canvas.\n\nJenkins died in Manhattan, USA in 2012, one month prior to his 89th birthday, after suffering an illness. The Strand Bookstore in Manhattan, which the artist loved to frequent over many years, devoted a window to him when they learned of his death.\n\n\nRetrospective exhibitions of Jenkins work have included:\n\nMajor solo exhibitions of his work have included: \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1890473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890473", "title": "Reparata and the Delrons", "text": "Reparata and the Delrons\n\nReparata and the Delrons was an American girl group. They are best known for their 1965 recordings \"Whenever A Teenager Cries\" and \"Tommy\", for the 1968 European hit \"Captain of Your Ship\" and for Reparata's 1975 solo hit \"Shoes\".\n\nThe group started out as a five-piece high school harmony group called the Delrons, formed in 1962 at St. Brendan's Catholic School in Brooklyn, New York by the lead singer Mary Aiese. The other original members included Nanette Licari, Regina Gallagher, and Ann Fitzgerald, but they were soon replaced by Sheila Reilly, Carol Drobnicki and Kathy Romeo. Romeo was replaced by Marge McGuire, but McGuire herself then left the group. All eight girls graduated St Brendan's in the Class of 1964.\n\nAs a trio, Aiese, O'Reilly and Drobnicki were spotted by record producers Bill and Steve Jerome. They asked Mary Aiese to choose a stage name to make the group name more interesting and marketable. She chose Reparata, her confirmation name, which she had taken from one of her favorite teachers at Good Shepherd Catholic grammar school.\n\nThe Jeromes recorded them in 1964 first for Laurie Records, then on the Pittsburgh-based World Artists label with Ernie Maresca's song \"Whenever a Teenager Cries\". The song became a regional hit and reached #60 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The follow-up, \"Tommy,\" co-written by Chip Taylor, reached #92. Writing about \"Tommy\" in her 2003 memoir \"A Misfit's Manifesto: The Spiritual Journey of a Rock-and-Roll Heart\", journalist and sociologist Donna Gaines comments:\n\nThe 1965 album \"Whenever a Teenager Cries\" showcased the singles, and included covers of popular hits by \"British invasion\" groups including The Beatles' \"If I Fell\" and Manfred Mann's \"Doo Wah Diddy Diddy\".\n\nThe group opened for the Rolling Stones at the Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center on their Spring 1965 North American tour.\nThe group became more widely known when they were invited to tour nationally with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars on two occasions during 1965. However Sheila Reilly and Carol Drobnicki left the group just before the second tour began, and Reparata performed solo on the tour, with backing vocals from the wings. The next two singles were credited only to Reparata: \"A Summer Thought\" and \"I Found My Place\".\n\nWhen Reparata and the Delrons signed with RCA in 1965, new Delrons were needed. Original member Nanette Licari was brought back. \"I Can Tell\", the first single for RCA needed a third vocalist, and although it has been reported that Lesley Gore sang on the track, it was actually session singer Lesley Miller, while Gore recorded her own version of the song. 18-year-old Lorraine Mazzola was soon recruited to join the group.\n\nThis line-up of Reparata, Licari and Mazzola became the group's best-known and most prolific, although ironically they never released an album and none of their dozen singles ever made the US national charts. Their 1967 release \"It's Waiting There For You\" became a minor hit in Colorado Springs, Colorado, with airplay on KYSN, 1460-AM. After several unsuccessful releases in a style similar to the Shangri-Las, including Jeff Barry's \"I’m Nobody's Baby Now,\" and \"I Can Hear the Rain\" which featured the then-unknown Melba Moore, the group moved again to Mala Records.\n\nIn 1968 they released the up-tempo \"Captain of Your Ship\", co-written by Kenny Young. Although the song missed the U.S. national charts, it became their biggest ever hit when it made #13 in the UK Singles Chart, and the group toured there. The trio's backing group on this tour was Clouds. \"Saturday Night Didn't Happen\" and \"Weather Forecast\" were also issued as singles, but did not repeat the success of \"Captain of Your Ship\". Young said of this period: '\"They were responsible for me moving to England. I accompanied them to Top Of The Pops...[and]...attended the reception for their hit single \"Captain Of Your Ship\", along with John Lennon and Ringo at the Revolution Club in London. I met half the Beatles at our own reception...\"\".\n\n\"Captain Of Your Ship\" was popular in many European countries, and was released in Australia and Rhodesia. Footage of the group performing the song live on the \"Beat-Club\" show on German television, introduced by Dave Lee Travis and available on video sharing websites, appears to be the only archive television footage of the group, except for some cable spots from much later in their career. The \"Beat Club\" clip shows that Reparata sings lead on the song, not Lorraine Mazzola as reported in some histories of the group. The record's success in Europe led to the group being invited to perform at the Interfestival in Poland in August 1968 alongside British act Julie Driscoll with the Brian Auger Trinity, and Austrian Udo Jürgens as well as acts from Poland, USSR, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe B-side \"Toom-Toom is a Little Boy\" gave the group the unusual accolade of a release in pre-revolutionary Iran in 1968, on an EP alongside tracks by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, Otis Redding and Tommy James.\n\nIn 1969 the group provided backing vocals for the Rolling Stones' single \"Honky Tonk Women\", recorded at Olympic Studios in London, and for the Ox-Bow Incident cover of The Four Tops' \"Reach Out\".\n\nThe group's 18th and final single was released in September 1969. A cover of The Ronettes' Walking in the Rain, its potential to be a hit was challenged when Jay and the Americans released their own version the following month, which reached number 19 in the Billboard charts. The latter group acknowledged the issue by having \"Sorry Reparata\" etched into the record's vinyl.\n\nReparata married in 1969. She took her husband's name and became Mary O'Leary. She decided to stop doing live shows and to concentrate on starting a family and on her separate career as a schoolteacher.\n\nReparata agreed that Lorraine Mazzola and Nanette Licari would carry on without her doing live shows as The Delrons. They recruited Helaine Tobias, who performed as Cooky, and with Lorraine Mazzola on lead vocals they performed Reparata and the Delrons' back catalogue. The musicians who played with the live group from this time included Dave Camacho (keyboard), Augie Ciulla (drums), Frank Franco (guitar), Frankie Pelligrino (sax) and Cooky's future husband Joe Sirico (bass).\n\nReparata had already recorded some lead vocals for the group's second LP, \"1970 Rock'n'Roll Revolution\", which is a collection of covers of pop standards songs of the 1950s and 1960s, and these tracks were included on the album. The album cover artwork shows the new line-up without Reparata, and the other band members also took some lead vocals on the album. The vocal arrangements on the album are credited to Lorraine Mazzola.\n\nDuring her time as lead singer with The Delrons, Lorraine Mazzola began to introduce herself as Reparata. The live shows stopped in 1973 when Mazzola joined Barry Manilow's back-up singers Lady Flash. In Lady Flash, Mazzola began to use the stage name \"Reparata Mazzola\", and has done so ever since. For clarity, in this history of the group Reparata always refers to Mary Aiese O'Leary.\n\nCooky Sirico and Nanette Licari did not continue with the group after Lorraine Mazzola left, and Reparata and the Delrons went on hiatus as a live act in 1973.\n\nWhile The Delrons played live shows without her, Reparata continued to release new singles produced by Steve and Bill Jerome, who had worked on all the group's records since 1964.\n\n\"There's So Little Time\" was released as Big Tree 114 in 1971, written by Rupert Holmes and Danny Jordan. The B-side is \"Just You\" written by the Jeromes and K. Stella.\n\nIn February 1972, Reparata signed a three-year contract with Dart Records, a UK-based label. Dart quickly released \"Octopus's Garden\" (Dart ART 2006), a cover version of The Beatles song. The recording is credited to Reparata and the Delrons, although only Reparata is featured, not any of the Delrons who were still playing live in the US at that time. The B-side is \"Your Life is Gone\", a dramatic story song similar to The Shangri-La's' \"Leader of the Pack\". In the US, it was released on Laurie Records, who had released the Delrons first single back in 1964. The production of \"Octopus's Garden\" uses some vocal effects and sound effects to recapture the quirky mood and sound of the groups' earlier recordings like \"Captain of Your Ship\" and \"Weather Report\", and \"Your Life is Gone\" includes some car-crash and ambulance sound effects like \"Leader of the Pack\". References to the Beatles and the Shangri-Las, and allusions to the group's own previous hits, seemed dated in 1972, and the record was not a hit.\n\nTo capitalize on Reparata's new material for Dart, the group's 1968 UK hit \"Captain of Your Ship\" / Toom Toom Is a Little Boy (Bell Records BL 1252) was re-released there in July 1972, but it did not make the charts this time.\n\nIn 1974 a remake of the group's 1964 hit \"Whenever a Teenager Cries\" was released as on the North American Music Industries label as NAMI 2024. As ever, it was produced by the Jeromes and arranged by John Abbott. It has a mono recording on one side and a stereo recording on the other. It featured only Reparata, although credited to the group. It may have been the original vocal with an overdubbed country guitar.\n\nOn 18 October 1974 Reparata released a solo single \"Shoes\", backed with \"A Song for All\", as a UK-only promo on Surrey International Records as SIT 5013. Reparata's contract with Dart Records ended in February 1975, and \"Shoes\" was then given a commercial release on her new label Polydor in the summer of that year. While the single was drawing praise for its catchy and unique sound, promotion and distribution were hampered by two legal disputes.\n\nFirst, there was a dispute over the name Reparata. Mary O'Leary had used the name since her confirmation as a teenager, and as her stage name since 1964, first as lead singer of Reparata and the Delrons until 1969, then afterwards as a solo performer. Former bandmate Lorraine Mazzola was now also using the name, having taken over from O'Leary as lead singer at live shows between 1969 and 1973. After this line-up disbanded, Mazzola continued to use the name when working as Barry Manilow's back-up singer, benefiting from the impression that Mazzola had been the lead voice of the still fondly-remembered girl group Reparata and the Delrons.\n\nWhen Mary O'Leary released her latest Reparata solo single \"Shoes\" in 1975, with Mazzola now also singing with as Reparata with Barry Manilow, this caused a problem. In a 2005 radio interview, Mary O'Leary explained that this seriously affected the success of \"Shoes\" because the record had to be removed from sale during the case: \"When the record came out, being done by Reparata, the record was squashed because, quote unquote, Reparata was with Barry Manilow. Believe me, it's a whole big megillah...\". O'Leary won the case when Mazzola did not come to the hearing.\n\nSecond, and separate from the dispute over the name Reparata, Dart Records disputed Polydor's right to the master tapes of \"Shoes\", which had been recorded during Reparata's contract with Dart. This dispute was settled out of court and the single was eventually released on 8 August 1975 on both Dart and Polydor with one catalogue number.\n\n\"Shoes\" did become a \"turntable hit\" in both the US and the UK. In August 1975 it reached #92 in the Billboard Hot 100, while in the UK it reached #43 in October 1975. The record's biggest chart success was in South Africa, where it made the Top 10 in early 1976.\n\nAfter Mary O'Leary won the right to perform as Reparata, Lorraine Mazzola changed her legal given name from Lorraine to Reparata and therefore she could also continue to use the name. This has continued to cause confusion down the years, with Lorraine Mazzola often assumed to be the person who led the group Reparata and the Delrons throughout its recording career, when in fact all recordings feature Mary O'Leary's lead vocal, except for some tracks on \"1970 Rock and Roll Revolution\" when all group members took turns singing lead.\n\nSome examples of the confusion: \n\n\"Billboard\" reported in November 1975 that Reparata was making a solo album with the Jeromes and Lou Guarino, for release in early 1976. The album was not released but the version of Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans 1963 hit \"Why Do Lovers Break Each Others Hearts\" was included on the 2004 Ace Records compilation, \"Where The Girls Are Volume 6\".\n\nFrom the recordings, Reparata release the single \"Jesabee Lancer (The Belly Dancer)\" in 1976 on Polydor, number 2058688, in the UK only. Like \"Shoes\", it is an Eric Beam song originally recorded by his group Felix Harp in the early 1970s. Their original was called \"Savait\", and was about Jessica Lancer, not Jesabee Lancer. Also like \"Shoes\", it has a Middle Eastern or Turkish pop sound which echoes the song's lyrics about a belly dancer. In contrast, the B-side is a religious ballad called \"We Need You\". The record did not make the UK singles charts, and it has been rarely heard since.\n\nMeanwhile in March 1976, following the success of \"Shoes\" in the UK and capitalising on recent success of a reissue of The Shangri-La's \"Leader of the Pack\", Reparata's former UK label Dart Records re-packaged the 1972 single which had featured the Beatles cover \"Octopus's Garden\" on the A-side, and the Shangri-La's-like \"Your Life Is Gone\" on the B-side. Dart reversed the A- and B-sides, changed the credit from Reparata and the Delrons to simply Reparata, and assigned a new catalogue number ART 2057.\n\nThe group's 1965 album \"Whenever a Teenager Cries\" continued to be sold throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The group's biography on the MTV website comments that the album was\n\nIn the late 1970s, several of the group's 1960s singles including \"Panic\" and \"It's Waiting There For You\" became favourites on the Northern soul scene in England. \"Panic\" was re-released in the UK in 1978 on an EP of Northern Soul classics which also featured tracks by Gerri Granger and James & Bobby Purify.\n\nThat same year, Mary O'Leary asked Nanette Licari and Cooky Sirico to reform the group with her. All three were now in their mid-30s, with jobs outside the music industry: O'Leary was a schoolteacher, Licari a cashier at a Brooklyn department store, and Sirico a secretary at a brokerage stock cage. The group became a part-time project for the trio, and they performed approximately once a month on the oldies circuit, and at club gigs and private functions in the New York City and New England areas for over twenty years.\n\nIn 1979, the group contributed vocals to Gary Private's EP \"Private\", on the songs \"Caught Up In Los Angeles\" and \"Rumor Has It\". Private commented that \n\"my producer Fred Munao knew them from other sessions so we brought them in. I was thrilled as I grew up to their voices.\".\n\nIn 1981, they released a privately pressed LP called \"On the Road Again\" on the Perfection Sound label, and they appeared on Don K. Reed's radio show \"Doo Wop Shop\" in 1982 singing a cappella \"The Book of Love\", \"So Young\" and \"Brooklyn\".\n\n\"Captain of Your Ship\" remained a popular oldie in the UK, and it was re-released as a B-side in January 1985 on the Old Gold label as OG 9504, with the A-side \"Keep On\" by Bruce Channel.\n\nIn June 1985, the group joined James Brown and many other 1950s and 1960s artists to record the Roots of Rock 'n' Roll Against Famine charity single \"Our Message to the People (For The Children)\". It was released in November 1986 and sales benefited the UNICEF World Hunger campaign.\n\nNanette Licari left the group in 1987 and Lauren Stich took her place. With this line-up, the group made a second appearance on Don K. Reed's \"Doo Wop Shop\" in 1988, performing \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\" and performed as part of the Solid Gold Super Show at Nassau Coliseum in 1987 alongside many recording artists of the '50s and '60s.\n\nReparata says in a 2016 interview that the live performances of this period were the group's best, especially compared to the hops and club gigs of their early career, when they would either lip sync or work with a house band that was not familiar with their material:\n\n\"Captain of Your Ship\" was adapted for a 1990 UK TV commercial for Müllerice, and the same year it was sampled by Betty Boo on her single \"Doin' The Do\".\n\nIn the early 1990s Lauren Stich returned to her main career as a horse-racing journalist and handicapper. Judy Jae joined Reparata and Cooky Sirico in what would be the group's final line-up.\n\nA budget Best Of compilation, called \"Whenever a Teenager Cries\" like the group's original 1965 LP, was released in 1993 on the Collectable label.\n\nDuring the 1990s the group was managed first by Mary O'Leary's husband Jon, then by Vito Picone. The group recorded tracks for a Christmas CD in the mid-1990s. It was not released, but their version of \"Winter Wonderland\" appeared on the 2010 compilation \"Christmas Harmonies\", and is available via Soundcloud.\n\nIn 1996 the group performed on Art Loria's cable show \"Twilight Time\". The clip is available on YouTube. The following year, Ace Records included an unreleased track \"Look in My Diary\" on the compilation \"Where the Girls Are, vol. 1\".\n\nIn 2000, Mary O'Leary retired from teaching and decided it was time to also disband the group for good, almost 40 years after she formed the group as a high school student.\n\nReparata and the Delrons' recordings are regularly featured on compilations of songs by girl groups, 1960's records and Northern Soul favourites. Since 2000 they have been featured on at least 16 such anthologies (see Discography).\n\nIn May 2003, Mary O'Leary was a guest speaker at \"Italian Americans and Early Rock and Roll\", a symposium presented at Queens College, City University of New York by the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute and the university's Newman Center.\n\nLicensing tracks for a Best Of compilation was always going to be logistically difficult. In their twelve-year recording career, Reparata and the Delrons recorded for more than twelve different labels. There had been an unauthorised Best Of compilation in 2001, but it was not until 2005 that an authorised Ace Records compilation \"The Best of Reparata and the Delrons\" was released. The compilation included most of the singles, and some rarities, B-sides and unreleased material. It was accompanied by a comprehensive illustrated booklet, with some new commentary by Mary O'Leary.\n\nAlso released in 2005, the Rhino Records box set \"One Kiss Can Lead To Another: Girl Group Sounds - Lost & Found\" (Rhino R2 74615) featured \"I'm Nobody's Baby Now\" and \"Saturday Night Didn't Happen\". Mary O'Leary and Nanette Licari were guests at the album launch at The Cutting Room in New York City. The same month, Mary O'Leary gave an extended radio interview about her career to Alex McNeil, host of the \"Lost and Found\" show on the MIT college radio station WMBR.\n\nA Facebook page launched in 2008 as a community for group members, musicians, friends, family and fans. Mary O'Leary, Cooky Sirico, Lauren Stich, Judy Jae and some of the group's musicians are active participants. There is also an unofficial MySpace page (/reparatathedelrons).\n\nIn summer 2011, Nanette Licari was invited to perform some of the group's songs at the event \"She's Got the Power\", a celebration of the girl group sound at New York City's Lincoln Center. The supergroup formed for the event continues to perform occasionally as the Super Girls Group in New York and Connecticut, with members of The Chantels, The Toys, The Jaynetts, The Exciters and The Cookies forming a changing line-up at different shows.\n\nThe UK Northern Soul record label Outta Sight released \"Panic\" and \"Captain of Your Ship\" as a vinyl 45 in March 2016.\n\nMary O'Leary gave an interview in June 2016 to Arnie Amber on the WMBS show \"Oldies Unlimited\", where she spoke about her career, her theories about why the group did not make it bigger, and current interest in the group on social media.\n\nThe group had only one real hit in Europe with \"Captain of Your Ship\", and only a minor early hit in the US with \"Whenever a Teenager Cries\". In a 2016 radio interview, Reparata explains why she thinks the group did not have more commercial success:\n\nThis is an incomplete selection of compilation albums and CDs which feature tracks by Reparata and the Delrons, or Reparata solo.\n\nSeveral of the group's former members and musicians, as well as fans, friends and family, are active on the Reparata and the Delrons Facebook page.\n\nMary Catherine Aiese was born on December 31, 1947. She formed the group as a high school student in 1962. She led the group throughout its existence, except for 1969–1973 when she stopped performing live, although she continued to record. She married Jonathan O'Leary on 29 Noivember 1969 and took his name. They have two children Nicole and Jonathan Jr and four grandchildren Analiese, Nicholas, Jonathan III and Ava. Mary taught fifth and sixth grade for 32 years. In 1975 she had an unexpected solo hit in the UK and South Africa with \"Shoes\". Around this time, she also won a legal dispute with former bandmate Lorraine Mazzola over the right to perform as Reparata. O'Leary reformed the group in 1978 as a part-time project, finally disbanding the group in 2000 when she retired from teaching. She lives in Neponsit, Queens and works as an estate agent and a personal tutor. On 29 November 2019 she and Jon celebrated their golden wedding anniversary.\n\nNanette Rosemary Licari, born 24 May 1947, was in the earliest iteration of the group at high school from 1962–1963, then she rejoined in 1965. Nanette continued to perform with the group until the late 1980s. During the 5-year period when the group was inactive from 1973, she worked as a cashier at a Brooklyn department store. She later became an elementary school teacher and worked at a Catholic school in Brooklyn, from where she is now retired. In summer 2011 she performed at the event \"She's Got the Power\", a celebration of the girl group sound at New York City's Lincoln Centre. She continues to perform occasionally in the Long Island area as a member of oldies group the Tercels and at nostalgia gigs with other former members of 1960s girl groups. Nanette lives in Ozone Park, Queens with her husband Robert Salerno, where she occasionally makes the local news as a high-profile animal lover and rescuer of stray cats.\n\nLorraine Marie Mazzola, born 25 February 1947, joined the group in 1965. She became lead singer in 1969 when Mary Aiese decided to stop doing live shows, and informally called herself Reparata. Mazzola left the group in 1973 to form Barry Manilow's backing group Lady Flash, staying with them until 1979.\nAfter losing the 1975 court case to Mary O'Leary over the sole right to the stage name Reparata, Mazzola formally changed her given name to Reparata. She co-wrote the book \"Mafia Kingpin: the True Story of Sonny Gibson\" (1981), and she wrote and acted in a film with Gibson called \"Dark Before Dawn\" (1988). More recently, she has been developing the book into a movie. She was nominated for an Emmy as writer-producer of an informational series for WCBS-TV in New York. In May 2001 she pleaded guilty to being involved in a fraudulent investment scheme with Gibson. Mazzola contributed an essay to the 2007 book \"Women's Poker Night\", and for five years she was a contributing editor for \"Poker Pro\" magazine. She was Events and Operations director for WriteGirl, a programme in creative writing for at-risk young women in Los Angeles and continues to work in the entertainment field. Mazzola brought her experience as a writer and fundraiser for non-profits to her work as Secretary for the Gate Community, a spiritual organisation of entertainment professionals. She and her partner Chef Gordon Smith published \"Save the Males: A Kitchen Survival Cookbook\" in 2013. In 2017 she was running the social media campaign for the upcoming \"Ed Wood: The Musical\". She lives in Los Angeles.\n\nCooky Sirico was born Helaine F. Tobias on 2 February 1948 She first became a Delron in 1969 when Mary O'Leary stopped performing live. Originally known by the mononym Cooky, in November 1971 she married the group's bass player Joe Sirico (born 29 November 1946) and took his name. When the live group became inactive in 1973, Cooky became a secretary at a brokerage stock cage. Cooky rejoined the group when they reformed as a part-time project in 1978 and performed with them for the next 22 years until they disbanded in 2000. Cooky and Joe continue to perform in the tri-state area in the oldies groups The BeBops, Johnny and the Raybands, and Just Friends. Cooky also performs with The Remnants and with Witness, and Joe plays with the Brooklyn Keys. Cooky and Joe have two adult daughters, Jackie and Stephanie.\n\nCarol Dorothy Drobnicki, born 13 February 1947 was in the group 1962–1964. She married Frank Barsh in September 1965, and later remarried and was known as Carol Scordilis. She died from cancer in December 1980 at the age of 33.\n\nSheila Anne Reilly was a Delron from 1963–1965. She became a teacher, and taught at St Thomas Aquinas School in Brooklyn. She later moved to Seattle, Washington and became a school principal.\n\nJudy Jae was in the final line-up from 1992 to 2000. She went on to record four CDs of original country-crossover material in Nashville, and continues to perform in Manhattan and on Long Island, and to write music under the name Judy Rae Jae.\n\nLauren S. Stich was born on Christmas Day 1951. She joined the group for a year in the late 1980s. Lauren continues to sing occasionally, but works more behind the scenes as the founder and director of a talent agency. Lauren also has a separate career as a respected writer on horse racing, and she also breeds horses. She wrote a weekly column for the \"Daily Racing Form\"and is now a racing handicapper and analyst for the \"Racing Digest\". Lauren lives in Las Vegas.\n\nKatherine Anne Romeo was in the group from 1962–1963. She still lives in Brooklyn. She is a widow with two grandchildren.\n\nAnne Frances Fitzgerald and Regina Marie Gallagher were in the group from 1962–1963, and Marguerite Frances McGuire was a member from 1963–1965.\n\nDrummer Augie Ciulla recorded with his nephews' band The Infinite Staircase, and was featured on their debut album \"The Road Less Taken\", which was released in early 2009. Keyboard player Dave Camacho performs with the Borinquen Blues Band.\n\n\n"}

The 15-year agreement includes an annual contribution to the veterans trust fund along with upkeep of the arena. It is corporately sponsored despite a city ordinance that on its face prohibits the arena from having such a name. The ordinance does not cover any other venues, which allows for two other venues in Duval County to have corporate sponsors, most notably TIAA Bank Field.\n\n\nThe arena was designed, using state-of-the-art techniques, to have the acoustical characteristics necessary for concerts. The first artist to hold a concert in the Arena was Elton John in November 2003. Since that time, dozens of groups, including country, rap, rock, and others, have performed at the arena.\n\nIn 2006, a scheduled Dixie Chicks concert was cancelled, due to lack of ticket sales, which was seen as part of the general backlash against the group's comments on the Iraq War.\n\nSporting events hosted include the 2004 USA Men's Olympic basketball team in their only game played in the United States, as well as some early round games of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 2006, 2010, 2015, and 2019.\n\nOn October 17, 2006 an episode of ECW on Sci-Fi was held in the arena.

Their single \"Cherry Bomb\" from the Elektra Records album of the same title reached the Top 40 of the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2001, as well as the Top 50 in the Dance chart.\n\nDespite the initial promise of success, Richardson expressed displeasure with the marketing direction for 1 plus 1, and the act was recreated as alternative rock band MNQNN (pronounced \"mannequin\"). This music, differing greatly from the prior 1 plus 1 work, prompted Elektra to release them from their recording contract. MNQNN played rock clubs for a couple of years before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in June 2003.\n\nRichardson persuaded Josh Deutsch of Virgin Records to sign her to that record label. She reconnected with Steve Sydelink who had worked in her bands and was the drummer in Madonna's band.\n\nIn 2004, Richardson returned to major label recording, after Sydelink introduced her to record producer Stuart Price (also known as Jacques Lu Cont) under the name 'Juliet'. The album resulting from this project, \"Random Order\", was released in August 2005; reviews of advance copies have been well received by critics. The advance single, \"Avalon\", reached the top 5 on the European Dance chart in May 2005, and number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart in March 2005. \"Avalon\" was popular at the 2005 'Miami Winter Music Conference'. The song also reached the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart in April 2005. She scored a second number one on the US dance chart in August with \"Ride the Pain\".\n\nIn August 2005, Richardson released her debut album on Virgin Records. Recorded with the help of record producer Stuart Price of Les Rythmes Digitales, Zoot Woman and Madonna's \"Confessions On A Dance Floor\" fame, the album drew comparisons to a young Annie Lennox or Madonna thanks to her coolly emotional delivery with a sultry sexual charge. Richardson collaborated with other producers on the album, Guy Sigsworth on the song \"New Shoes\" and Jacknife Lee on \"Ride The Pain\". UK radio DJ Pete Tong supported \"Avalon\" on his show. Overall the album mixed old school electro and funk with modern-day pop sensibilities.\n\nIn 2007 she collaborated with David Guetta on \"Do Something Love\" for his Pop Life album.\n\nIn December 2012, Richardson and her husband Kyle Korver welcomed their first child, a girl named Kyra Elyse.

Running roughly in an \"L\"-shaped pattern, SR 92 begins at SR 90 in Sierra Vista and ends at a traffic circle in Bisbee along SR 80, running entirely within Cochise County. The route was constructed and numbered as SR 92 in the late 1930s with a route that traveled further north past Sierra Vista than it does today. The routing was corrected in the 1960s.\n\nSR 92 begins at an intersection with Fry Boulevard in Sierra Vista. SR 90 is the designation along the roads heading north and east from the intersection. From here, SR 92 heads south through Sierra Vista, passing by residential areas in a desert terrain. The road then passes through the town of Nicksville while the west side of the route is flanked by the Coronado National Forest, in which Huachuca Mountains are located. SR 92 then turns eastward, passing within several miles within the Mexico–United States border. The route passes the town of Palominas before turning northeast. The roadway enters the town of Bisbee, meeting its terminus at a traffic circle in the city.\n\nThe highway is maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), which is responsible for maintaining SR 92 like all other highways around the state. As part of this role, ADOT periodically surveys traffic along its routes. These surveys are most often presented in the form of average annual daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around as few as 3,700 vehicles used the route daily near Palominas and as many as 31,000 daily near the northern terminus at Sierra Vista. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nThe highway was designated in 1936, originating at SR 82 in Whetstone and heading south into Sierra Vista. From there, it turned east for a stretch and then turned south following its current route to Bisbee. At this time, the section of the route corresponding to the current routing was paved, while the northern section was still a gravel road. The northern section was improved in 1942. In 1961, SR 90 took over the segment of SR 92 north of Sierra Vista, leaving SR 92 to the section south of the city and east to Bisbee. Since then, the routing has not been modified.\n"}

It is around 4 km long and named after Johann II of Liechtenstein who had the walkways installed in 1875.\n\nThe gorge is around 4 km in length of which 1 km is accessible to visitors by means of wooden walkways (closed in winter months). It has a depth of up to 300m and in some places is only a few meters wide. At the end of the gorge is a waterfall. It receives around 100,000 visitors a year.\n\nThe waters of the Großarler Ache, a mountain stream, formed the gorge over thousands of years. In 1875 work began by members of the Pongau Alpine Club to make the gorge accessible, however was unfinished due to a lack of funds. Prince Johann II. of Liechtenstein, who ran a hunting lodge in the nearby Großarl, donated 600 guilders for an expansion of the work. At the completion of work in 1876 the gorge was renamed to honour the generous donation from the Prince.\n\nAccording to legend, the gorge was created when the devil full of anger and rage over a failed plan, flew across the canyon throwing water into it with such force as to carve the rock.\n\n"}

Seating 7,182 for hockey and arena football and up to 9,252 for concerts.\n\nMacon Centreplex was built in 1968 as the first facility of its size and kind in the state. Mayor Ronnie Thompson was among its most influential backers. Thompson, who served from 1967-1975, blocked an appearance at the facility by the boxer Muhammad Ali because the mayor objected to Ali's Conscientious Objector status during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe Centreplex quickly became Central Georgia's premier sports, entertainment and trade show venue, with concerts by well-known performers such as Elvis Presley. Presley performed at the centreplex on April 15, 1972, afternoon show and evening show, April 24, 1975, August 31, 1976, and June 1, 1977.

World Championship Wrestling (WCW) was a frequent visitor of the Centreplex, holding multiple television tapings and non-televised house shows all throughout the 90s. WCW's supercard Clash of the Champions XXI aired live from the Centreplex on TBS on November 18, 1992. The show featured Ricky Steamboat & Shane Douglas winning the unified WCW World Tag Team Championship and NWA World Tag Team Championship from Barry Windham & Dustin Rhodes. Windham turned heel on Rhodes after the match.\n\n\"WCW Monday Nitro\", WCW's flagship weekly live television show that aired on TNT, emanated from the Centreplex a few times:\n\n-- November 20, 1995\n\n-- May 27, 1996 (notable for being the first two-hour episode of the show and Scott Hall's debut in WCW, beginning the New World Order storyline)\n\n-- December 23, 1996\n\n-- June 23, 1997\n\n-- December 22, 1997 (notable for being the first and only episode of \"nWo Monday Nitro\")\n\nWWE also visits the Centreplex.

It has been described as mostly liberal or liberal-leaning. The site offers news, satire, blogs, and original content and covers politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy living, women's interests, and local news featuring columnists.\n\nFounded by Andrew Breitbart, Arianna Huffington, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti, the site was launched on May 9, 2005. In March 2011, it was acquired by AOL for US$315 million, making Arianna Huffington editor-in-chief. In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media.\n\nIn 2012, the website became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThe site offers user-generated content via video blogging, audio, and photo content posted directly on the site.\n\n\"The Huffington Post\" was launched on May 9, 2005 as a commentary outlet, blog, and an alternative to news aggregators such as the \"Drudge Report\". It was founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti.\n\nPrior to \"HuffPost\", Huffington hosted the website Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was the website Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton.\n\nAn early \"HuffPost\" strategy was crafting search engine optimized stories and headlines based around trending keywords, such as \"What Time Is the Super Bowl?\"\n\nIn August 2006, \"HuffPost\" raised a $5 million Series A round from SoftBank Capital and Greycroft.\n\nIn December 2008, \"HuffPost\" raised $25 million from Oak Investment Partners at a $100 million valuation and Fred Harman of Oak Investment Partners joined its board of directors. The money was to be used for technology, infrastructure, investigative journalism, and development of local versions.\n\nIn June 2009, Eric Hippeau, co-managing partner of Softbank Capital, became CEO of HuffPost.\n\nIn January 2011, the \"HuffPost\" website received 35% of its traffic from web search engines, compared to 20% at CNN. This strategy appealed to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who tried to implement similar SEO-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of \"HuffPost\".\n\nIn March 2011, AOL acquired \"HuffPost\" for 315 million. As part of the deal, Arianna Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of \"HuffPost\" and existing AOL properties Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater (now HuffPost Celebrity), AOL Music, AOL Latino (now \"HuffPost Voices\"), AutoBlog, Patch, and StyleList.\n\n\"HuffPost\" subsumed many of AOL's \"Voices\" properties, including \"AOL Black Voices\", which was established in 1995 as Blackvoices.com, and \"AOL Latino\", \"Impact\" (launched in 2010 as a partnership between \"HuffPost\" and Causecast), \"Women\", \"Teen\", \"College\", \"Religion\", and the Spanish-language \"Voces (en español)\". The \"Voices\" brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of \"Gay Voices\", dedicated to LGBT-relevant articles.\n\nBy late 2013, the website operated as a \"stand-alone business\" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing \"premium advertising\".\n\nIn June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media.\n\nArianna Huffington resigned to pursue other ventures, and in December 2016 was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Lydia Polgreen.\n\nIn April 2017, Polgreen announced the company would rebrand, changing its name to \"HuffPost\", with changes to the design of its website and logo and content and reporting.\n\nOn January 24, 2019, 20 employees were laid off as a part of Verizon Media laying off 7% of its staff. The opinion and health sections were eliminated. Pulitzer Prize finalist Jason Cherkis lost his job.\n\n\n\nThe site originally published work from both paid reporters and unpaid bloggers.\n\nIn February 2011, Visual Art Source, which had been cross-posting material from its website, went on strike against \"HuffPost\" to protest its writers not being paid. In March 2011, the strike and the call to boycott was joined and endorsed by the National Writers Union and NewsGuild-CWA; however, the boycott was dropped in October 2011.\n\nIn April 2011, \"HuffPost\" was targeted with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit by Jonathan Tasini on behalf of thousands of uncompensated bloggers. On March 30, 2012, the suit was dismissed with prejudice by the court, holding that the bloggers had volunteered their services, their compensation being publication.\n\nIn 2015, Wil Wheaton stated that he refused to allow his work to be reused for free on the site.\n\nThe practice of publishing blog posts from unpaid contributors ended in January 2018. \n\nBefore the practice of publishing unpaid content ended, the following people made contributions to the site:\n\n\"HuffPost\" has been criticized for providing a platform for alternative medicine and supporters of vaccine hesitancy. Steven Novella, president of the New England Skeptical Society, criticized \"HuffPost\" for allowing homeopathy proponent Dana Ullman to have a blog on the site.\n\nIn July 2019, Huffpost was criticized for publishing a story written by Rachel Wolfson, a publicist, that praised Jeffrey Epstein. Editors later removed the article at the author's request.\n\n\"HuffPost\" has been described as a mostly liberal or liberal-leaning magazine, although there is a perception that it defends the centrist establishment of the Democratic Party.\n\nCommenting in 2012 on increased conservative engagement on the website despite its reputation as a liberal news source, \"HuffPost\" founder Arianna Huffington stated that her website is \"increasingly seen\" as an Internet newspaper that is \"not positioned ideologically in terms of how we cover the news\". According to Michael Steel, press secretary for Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, Republican aides \"engage with liberal websites like \"The Huffington Post\" [anyway, if for] no other reason than [because] they drive a lot of cable coverage\". Jon Bekken, journalism professor at Suffolk University, has cited \"The Huffington Post\" as an example of an \"advocacy newspaper\". \"The Wall Street Journal\" editor James Taranto has mockingly referred to it as the \"\"Puffington Host\",\" while Rush Limbaugh has referred to it as the \"\"Huffing and Puffington Post\".\"\n\nDuring the 2016 United States presidential election, \"HuffPost\" regularly appended an editor's note to the end of stories about candidate Donald Trump, reading: \"Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims—1.6 billion members of an entire religion—from entering the U.S.\" After Trump was elected on November 8, 2016, \"HuffPost\" ended this practice.\n\n\n"}

Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration (part of the New Deal), the Coliseum has hosted numerous historical events, including the only performances ever held in Indiana by The Beatles, in 1964.\n\nOn October 26, 2012, the Coliseum held a \"Lights Out\" ceremony and closed for renovations. On April 24, 2014, after a 17-month, $53 million renovation, the Coliseum re-opened.\n\nIn December 2014, the Indiana Farmers Mutual Insurance Company entered into a ten-year agreement with the Indiana State Fair Commission to re-christen the arena as the Indiana Farmers Coliseum.\n\nOn October 31, 1963, during a Holiday on Ice show, a propane leak at a concession stand caused an explosion which killed 74 people and injured around 400 others. A memorial plaque was dedicated 40 years later in the building, but it has since been removed. Another plaque honoring the explosion victims currently hangs inside the building's lobby.\n\nThe venue was home to the Indiana Pacers of the American Basketball Association (ABA) from 1967 to 1974. The Pacers were very successful in their tenure at the Coliseum, winning three ABA Championships. They captured the ABA titles in 1969–70, defeating the Los Angeles Stars in 6 games, in 1971–72, defeating the New York Nets in 6 games, and in the 1972–73 season, defeating the Kentucky Colonels in 7 games. The team moved to Market Square Arena in 1974. In 1976, the Pacers became a franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA) when the ABA merged with the NBA.\n\nThe Pacers returned for a night when they played their first pre-season game of the 2008–09 season at the Pepsi Coliseum on October 8, 2008, hosting the then-New Orleans Hornets. 7,439 people watched the Pacers lose to the Hornets 105–71. The Pacers wore uniforms based on the 1967 to 1971 uniform design. Former ABA Pacers George McGinnis, Darnell Hillman, Bob Netolicky, Don Buse, Jerry Harkness, Steve Green, Tom Thacker, Bill Newton, and Wayne Pack, attended the game and were recognized during a halftime ceremony. During the game's first quarter, former Championship Pacers coach and current radio commentator Slick Leonard sat on the Pacers' bench as head coach, while then-head coach Jim O'Brien joined Mark Boyle for the radio broadcast.\n\nThe Indianapolis Capitals of the American Hockey League played at the Coliseum from 1939 to 1952, winning the Calder Cup in 1942 and 1950.

These open cupboards typically had between one and three display tiers, and at the time, a drawer or multiple drawers fitted to them. The word cupboard gradually came to mean a closed piece of furniture.\n\nAn airing cupboard is a built-in storage space, sometimes of walk-in dimensions, containing a water heater, either an immersion heater for hot running water or a boiler for central heating water (hence, also \"boiler cupboard\"), or a hot water storage tank. Shelves, usually slatted to allow for circulation of heat, are positioned above or around the heater to provide room for clothing. The purpose is to allow air to circulate around the stored fabrics to prevent damp forming.\n\nSome variants of airing cupboards also serve as the linen cupboard, the storing area of the household's clean sheets and towels.\n\nIn another version, the airing cupboard serves as a temporary drying space, either for laundry or for wet outdoor clothes and shoes. Its shelves can be used to fully remove traces of damp from dried clothing before the items are put away elsewhere in drawers and wardrobes. A moveable electrical version of this is a drying cabinet.\n\nA built-in cupboard is a storage space that forms part of the design of the room and is not free-standing or moveable. It is not the same as a cabinet.\n\nA linen cupboard is an enclosed recess of a room used for storing household linen (e.g. sheets, towels, tablecloths) and other things for storage, usually with shelves, or a free-standing piece of furniture for this purpose.\n\nMost offices have a lockable repository for valuables. The heart of this is usually the supply of stationery.\n\n"}

He was primarily known for his promotion of White separatism, National Socialism, antisemitism, and Holocaust denial. Schmidt was arrested in Germany on hate charges in 1995, but avoided standing trial by returning to the USA while released on bail.\n\nSchmidt was born on 24 April 1927, in Völklingen. During Nazi rule, he was a member of the Hitler Youth, and, by his own account, joined the Waffen-SS in 1943 at the age of 16, and served as a corporal in the SS Division Leibstandarte. Schmidt was wounded twice during campaigns in Hungary, Austria, and the Battle of the Bulge. He left Germany in 1947, arrived in the United States in 1949, and became a naturalized citizen in 1955 in Chicago.\n\nIn 1983, Schmidt founded the German-American National Political Action Committee (GANPAC), which published the \"GANPAC Brief\" in English and the \"USA-Bericht\" ([\"U.S.A. Report\"]) in German. GANPAC was characterized as \"pretending to represent the 52 million Americans of German descent\" by the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\", as \"openly anti-Semitic\" by \"The New York Times\", and as \"virulently anti-Semitic\" by the Anti-Defamation League. GANPAC was also accused of promoting Holocaust denial.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985, GANPAC raised about $55,000 in contributions, but, unlike other political action committees, did not make any financial contributions until the late 1980s, when it began donating money to the election campaigns of conservative Republican candidates. When U.S. Senator Steve Symms gave a $1,000 contribution from GANPAC to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the Idaho Holocaust Council, Schmidt complained to the Federal Election Commission. GANPAC also made a contribution to Democrat Bob Edgar who was running against Jewish Republican candidate Arlen Specter.\n\nThe Santa Monica offices of GANPAC were fire-bombed in 1985, causing $50,000 in damage. Schmidt claimed the Jewish Defense League carried out the attack, a claim the JDL rejected.\n\nThe \"GANPAC Brief\" was published out of Washington, D.C. (1983-1989), Santa Monica, California (1990-1993), Burke, Virginia (January–March 1994), and Pensacola, Florida (April 1994-July 2004).\n\nSchmidt also founded the German-American Information and Education Association (GIEA), which is presided over by E. Stanley Rittenhouse, a known anti-Semite, who \"served as chief legislative representative for the Liberty Lobby, a far right organization founded by Willis Carto, whom the Anti-Defamation League calls \"perhaps the most influential professional anti-Semite in the United States\".\n\nIn one of his last speeches, William Luther Pierce briefly discussed a longtime friendship with Hans Schmidt.\n\nOn 9 August 1995 Schmidt was arrested at the Frankfurt airport by German authorities after copies of his newsletter, \"USA-Bericht\", were discovered. He was charged with \"incitement to hate\" (Volksverhetzung in German) as a result of a letter he had sent to a German state legislator in Schwerin. Schmidt came to regard the German government as treasonous and controlled by \"\"Oberjuden\"\" (\"top Jews\"), and claimed the U.S. embassy provided false information to Germany to persecute him. The ADL applauded his arrest. Due to poor health, he was released on bail in January 1996. He fled Germany and returned to the US to avoid further persecution. He wrote a book about this experience, titled \"Jailed in 'Democratic' Germany\" (1997).\n\nSchmidt continued anti-Semitic campaigns, first by calling for a repeal of the Kosher tax (specifically addressing the Adolph Coors Brewing Co.), and later by writing a book entitled \"End Times/End Games\" (1999) where he listed all the ways \"Aryans\" were more accomplished than Jews and begged all Jews to voluntarily leave white-majority countries on their own accord. His influence waned as his friend Ernst Zundel's career withered, and he died in 2010. He had no known survivors.\n\n\n\n"}

He held political offices, the most important being Lord President of the Council of Wales and the Marches. He became very wealthy and was a benefactor of a number of institutions. He was a co-founder of Brasenose College, Oxford and endowed a grammar school in the village of his birth in Lancashire.\n\nSmyth was born in the south Lancashire village of Farnworth in the parish of Prescot, which now falls within the town of Widnes in the Borough of Halton. Smyth was the fourth son of Robert Smyth of Peel Hall. He was allegedly brought up during his youth at nearby Knowsley Hall, the home of Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby. At this time Stanley was married to his second wife Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond. Lady Margaret was the mother of the future Henry VII by her previous marriage to Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, and she was to have an important influence in Smyth's life.\n\nSmyth went to the University of Oxford. His college is uncertain, being either Oriel or Lincoln, or both in succession. In 1476 he gained the degree of bachelor of canon law and by 1492 he had received the degree of bachelor of civil law.\n\nOn 24 September 1485, one month after the battle of Bosworth and the consequent accession to the throne of Henry VII, Smyth was given the benefice of the deanery of Wimborne, Dorset, where Lady Margaret's parents were buried. On 20 October 1485 he was made a canon and prebendary of St Stephen's Chapel in the Palace of Westminster, where he became dean in 1490. He later obtained the livings of Combe Martin, Devon, of Great Grimsby and on 14 June 1492 he was instituted as rector of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. It is not possible to be sure about all his preferments because of his common name.\n\nOn 1 October 1492 he became bishop of Coventry and Lichfield and was consecrated on 3 February 1493 by Archbishop Morton. On 6 November 1496 he was translated to the diocese of Lincoln.\n\nOn 20 September 1485 Smyth gained a place in the Court of Chancery as keeper of the hanaper which gave him a salary for life. In 1486 he obtained a grant for the custody of the daughters of Edward IV. In 1493 Smyth was appointed a member of Prince Arthur's Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1500 he was made Chancellor of the University of Oxford.\n\nPrince Arthur died in April 1502 and in August of that year Smyth became Lord President of the Council, giving him full responsibility for the exercise of royal power in Wales. He continued to hold this post until at least 1512 or, possibly, until his death. By August 1502 he was no longer Chancellor of Oxford University.\n\nIn November 1495 Smyth refounded the hospital of St John the Baptist in Lichfield and added to it a school for poor children. In 1500 he founded the Cuerdley Chapel which was added to the south aisle of St Luke's Church, Farnworth for the use of his tenants from Cuerdley. The nearby village of Cuerdley was the seat of the very ancient Smith family of Cuerdley his armorial progenitors from which the renowned Captain John Smith also claimed his lineage. He purchased land including a footpath from the village to the church to allow entry for his tenants by a separate door to avoid contact with the residents of Farnworth at the time of the plague. In 1507 he made an endowment of £350 to found a grammar school in Farnworth, the village of his birth.\n\nAlso in 1507 Smyth founded a fellowship in Oriel College, Oxford, and gave manors to Lincoln College. Around the same time he and Sir Richard Sutton set out to found a new college in Oxford. They rebuilt Brasenose Hall, added other existing halls to it, and having obtained a charter in 1512, called it \"The King's haule and college of Brasennose\". This is now Brasenose College. Smyth's intention at the college was to benefit clergy from the north of England. The twelve fellows of the college were to have been born in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, or to have come from Lancashire, and particularly from the area of his birthplace. He gave to the college his lands of Cold Norton and, by his will, a considerable legacy of lands, plate, vestments, manuscripts and books.\n\nSmyth's ecclesiastical, legal and political duties resulted in his having a very busy life, only at times being resident in his diocese. He was very wealthy and was described by Hugh Latimer as being one of the \"unpreaching prelates\"; no sermons by him survive. He indulged in nepotism. Matthew Smyth was the first principal of Brasenose College, a William Smyth was archdeacon of Northampton and then of Lincoln and another William Smyth was appointed to St John's Hospital at Lichfield.\n\nWilliam Smyth died on 2 January 1514 at Buckden Palace, now in Cambridgeshire, one of the residences of the bishops of Lincoln. In addition to bequests to Brasenose College and Lincoln Cathedral, he made provision for a hospital at Banbury. He is buried in Lincoln Cathedral.\n\n"}

The season was full of suspense as the champions and the relegated teams were only known on the 33rd (on 34) matchday. Furthermore, the 3rd place (qualifying for UEFA Cup) had to be decided on a test-match, a fact that had not occurred recently.\n\nThese teams were promoted from the second division at the start of the season:\n\nThese teams were relegated to the second division at the end of the season:\n\nAs usual, the two giants (Sporting Anderlecht and Club Brugge) were occupying the first two places after 5 matches. Brugge was already 1st and actually stayed on top until the end. The Brussels side has indeed failed to show consistency under the management of Hugo Broos who was fired after a 0-0 draw at Gent. Under new coach (Franky Vercauteren), Anderlecht had a run of good form (after the initial 0-1 defeat against Oostende). Linked to the poor results of rivals Brugge, this situation led to a 6-point difference between the two clubs after 32 matches. The Brugge-Anderlecht game (33rd matchday) was thus decisive for both clubs. It ended with a 2-2 draw that was sufficient for the West Flemish.\n\nBrugge title is due to its exceptional regularity against smaller teams as is shown on the following table (showing points gained by a top 4 team against the other top 4 teams) :\n\nAs Anderlecht and Brugge rapidly ran away with the first two places, the battle for Europe was mainly consisted in the battle for UEFA Cup spots (or battle for the third place). Four teams were serious candidates: Standard, Genk, Charleroi and Gent. The latter two were soon dismissed. Before the last matchday, Standard was two points ahead of Genk but they lost their advantage after a 1-1 draw at Ostend while Genk earned a 3-1 win at Cercle Brugge. As both teams now had the same number of points and wins, a test-match had to be played (in two legs). Standard won the first match 3-1 but lost the away match 0-3 and lost the European ticket for next season.\n\nAfter their poor early results, five teams were predicted to fight against relegation: Sint-Truiden, Mouscron and especially newcomers FC Brussels and Oostende along with Mons. Beveren joined the list after a very poor final run. Before the 33rd matchday, the table read:\n\nLierse and Sint-Truiden were already saved.

His father, Julius Tappert (1892-1957), was a civil servant. His mother was Ewaldine Röll Tappert (1892-1981). Following high school, Tappert was drafted into the German army in World War II and ended up as a prisoner of war. Like the later author of the \"Derrick\" series, Herbert Reinecker, Tappert joined the \"Waffen-SS\". Initially a member of the \"SS-Flak-Ersatzabteilung\" (Arolsen), he was listed as a member of 3rd SS Division Totenkopf in March 1943. Following the war, he was hired as a bookkeeper at a theatre in Stendal, Germany, and became interested in acting. He took acting classes and gave his stage debut in Stendal, playing Dr. Stribel in Paul Helwig's \"Die Flitterwochen\".\n\nIn the following years, he changed employers several times and, in 1956, started working at the Kammerspiele, Munich. An independent actor since 1967, he worked as an actor until he died.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Tappert started taking part in movie and television productions. His big breakthrough was in 1966 with the three-part television show \"Die Gentlemen bitten zur Kasse\", in which he played train robber Michael Donegan. In 1968, he changed sides by playing Scotland Yard detective Perkins in Edgar Wallace movies. When the second public television station in Germany, the ZDF, started planning a new mystery series with a different type of investigator in 1973, he was chosen for the character of detective Stephan Derrick, with sidekick assistant Harry Klein (played by Fritz Wepper).\n\nThe character of Stephan Derrick became a cult figure. The series was licensed in 104 countries and was popular with the Chinese, Japanese, and Italians (and even Pope John Paul II). The last of 281 episodes was filmed in 1998, when Tappert reached his self-imposed age limit of 75 years for being a television actor.\n\nDivorced twice, he last lived in Gräfelfing near Munich with his third wife, Ursula Pistor (married in 1957). He was the father of three children. Tappert enjoyed fishing and hunting. He had a summer holiday home on the coast of northern Norway, a country where he also became a popular visitor as Derrick as well as a private person. Tappert and his wife Ursula had a cabin in Hamarøy municipality in Nordland from 1990 to 2008 when, due to his age and failing health, they had to sell the cabin. His wife Ursula Pistor is also an actor, a graduate of the same acting school in Berlin as Ellinor Hamsun, daughter of Knut Hamsun.\n\nIn interviews and his memoirs, Tappert did not elaborate on his World War II career, claiming to have served as a company medic in the \"Wehrmacht\", after which he became a prisoner of war. In April 2013 it was revealed that he had joined the infamous 3. SS-Panzergrenadier-Division Totenkopf, then deployed on the Eastern Front, in March 1943. Historian Jan Erik Schulte, an expert on the history of the SS, said that the circumstances of Tappert's membership of the SS and the question of whether he was pressured or coerced into joining remain unclear.\n\nTappert died on 13 December 2008 in Planegg, Germany.\n\n\n"}

Among their holdings were they owned \"Klaw and Erlanger's Costume Company\" and the \"Klaw & Erlanger Opera Company.\" \n\nBy 1895 Klaw & Erlanger were the second largest booking company in the US.\n\nIn 1896, Klaw & Erlanger joined with Al Hayman, Charles Frohman, Samuel F. Nixon, and J. Fred Zimmerman to form the \"Theatrical Syndicate\". Their organization established systemized booking networks throughout the US and created a monopoly that controlled every aspect of contracts and bookings until the late 1910s when the Shubert brothers broke their hold on the industry.\nDespite being nearly universally despised in the industry for their ruthless tactics, Klaw and Erlanger produced dozens of Broadway plays and financed many others including the early editions of the Ziegfeld Follies. \n\nThe partnership of Klaw & Erlanger was hurt as a result of the Actors' Equity strike of 1919. The partnership ended in 1919, and the last Broadway production by \"Klaw and Erlanger\" was in 1919 (\"The Velvet Lady\"). After that, Klaw built the Klaw Theatre and produced plays until his retirement in 1927.\n\nAfter his retirement, in 1929 Klaw moved to England, where he died in 1936 at Bracken Fell, Hassocks, West Sussex. He is buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist's Church, Clayton.\n\n"}

His work includes drama, poetry, and prose, and he has been considered one of the last great writers of Spanish Baroque literature.\n\nHe was born at Alcalá de Henares (or, less probably, Plasencia). He studied law at Salamanca, where he produced a comedy entitled \"Amour and Obligation\", which was acted in 1627. He became secretary to the count of Oropesa, and in 1654 he was appointed secretary of state as well as private secretary to Philip IV. Later he obtained the lucrative post of chronicler of the Indies, and, on taking orders in 1667 severed his connexion with the stage. He died at Madrid on 19 April 1686.\n\nOf his ten extant plays, two have some place in the history of the drama. \"El Amor al uso\" was adapted by Scarron and again by Thomas Corneille as \"L'Amour de la mode\", while \"La Gitanilla de Madrid\", itself founded on the novela of Cervantes, has been utilized directly or indirectly by Pius Alexander Wolff, Victor Hugo and Longfellow.\n\nThe titles of the remaining seven are \"Triumph from Armor and Fortune\", \"Eurídice y Orfeo\", \"The Alcetzar del secretion\", \"The Amazons\", \"The Doctor Carlino\", \"Un bobo hace ciento\" and \"Defend the Enemy\". \"Amor y obligación\" survives in a manuscript at the Biblioteca Nacional.\n\nThe \"Historia de la conquista de México, población y progresos de la América septentrional, conocida por el nombre de Nueva España\", covering the three years between the appointment of Cortés to command the invading force and the fall of the city, deservedly ranks as a Spanish prose classic. It was first published in 1684 in Spain. French and Italian translations were published by the 1690s, and an English translation by Townshend appeared in 1724. The book was extremely popular on both sides of the Atlantic and was known to important figures in colonial Latin America and the British colonies. It remained the most important European source on Latin American history up through the first part of the nineteenth century.\n\n"}

Simple functions are sufficiently \"nice\" that using them makes mathematical reasoning, theory, and proof easier. For example, simple functions attain only a finite number of values. Some authors also require simple functions to be measurable; as used in practice, they invariably are.\n\nA basic example of a simple function is the floor function over the half-open interval [1, 9), whose only values are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. A more advanced example is the Dirichlet function over the real line, which takes the value 1 if \"x\" is rational and 0 otherwise. (Thus the \"simple\" of \"simple function\" has a technical meaning somewhat at odds with common language.) All step functions are simple.\n\nSimple functions are used as a first stage in the development of theories of integration, such as the Lebesgue integral, because it is easy to define integration for a simple function and also it is straightforward to approximate more general functions by sequences of simple functions.\n\nFormally, a simple function is a finite linear combination of indicator functions of measurable sets. More precisely, let (\"X\", Σ) be a measurable space. Let \"A\", ..., \"A\" ∈ Σ be a sequence of disjoint measurable sets, and let \"a\", ..., \"a\" be a sequence of real or complex numbers. A \"simple function\" is a function formula_1 of the form\n\nwhere formula_3 is the indicator function of the set \"A\".\n\nThe sum, difference, and product of two simple functions are again simple functions, and multiplication by constant keeps a simple function simple; hence it follows that the collection of all simple functions on a given measurable space forms a commutative algebra over formula_4.\n\nIf a measure μ is defined on the space (\"X\",Σ), the integral of \"f\" with respect to μ is\n\nif all summands are finite.\n\nAny non-negative measurable function formula_6 is the pointwise limit of a monotonic increasing sequence of non-negative simple functions. Indeed, let formula_7 be a non-negative measurable function defined over the measure space formula_8 as before. For each formula_9, subdivide the range of formula_7 into formula_11 intervals, formula_12 of which have length formula_13. For each formula_14, set \n\nNow define the measurable sets \n\nThen the increasing sequence of simple functions \n\nconverges pointwise to formula_7 as formula_24. Note that, when formula_7 is bounded, the convergence is uniform. This approximation of formula_7 by simple functions (which are easily integrable) allows us to define an integral formula_7 itself; see the article on Lebesgue integration for more details.\n\n"}

It is related to absorption spectrum in many systems. Mathematically, it describes the inverse quantity of light required to evoke a constant response. It is very rare for an action spectrum to describe the level of biological activity, since biological responses are often nonlinear with intensity.\n\nAction spectra are typically written as unit-less responses with peak response of one, and it is also important to distinguish if an action spectrum refers to quanta at each wavelength (mol or log-photons), or to spectral power (W).\n\nIt shows which wavelength of light is most effectively used in a specific chemical reaction. Some reactants are able to use specific wavelengths of light more effectively to complete their reactions. For example, chlorophyll is much more efficient at using the red and blue regions than the green region of the light spectrum to carry out photosynthesis. Therefore, the action spectrum graph would show spikes above the wavelengths representing the colours red and blue.\n\nThe first action spectrum was made by T. W. Engelmann, who split light into its components by the prism and then illuminated \"Cladophora\" placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. He found that bacteria accumulated in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. He thus discovered the effect of the different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis and plotted the first action spectrum of photosynthesis.\n\nFurther examples include suppression of melatonin by wavelength and a variety of hazard functions, related to tissue damage from visible and near-visible light.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890619", "title": "James Stark (painter)", "text": "James Stark (painter)\n\nJames Stark (19 November 1794 – 24 March 1859) was an English landscape painter. A leading member of the Norwich School of painters, he was elected vice-president of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1828 and became their president in 1829. He had wealthy patrons and was consistently praised by the Norfolk press for his successful London career.\n\nStark was born in Norwich, the youngest son of an important dye manufacturer, Michael Stark, who is credited with the invention of the dye known as 'Norwich red'. On the completion of his education at Norwich School in 1811, he was apprenticed to John Crome, whose influence on his pupil was profound. His work was exhibited in London as early as 1811 and at the British Institution from 1814-18. In 1814 he moved away from Norwich to London, where he befriended the artist William Collins. In 1819 ill health forced him to return to Norwich, where lived for twenty years, before moving to Windsor in 1840, where he continued to produce landscapes. He returned to London in 1849, residing there until his death in 1859 at the age of 64. He is buried in the Rosary Cemetery in Norwich. \n\nStark generally worked in oils, although his total output included etchings, watercolours and pencil and chalk drawings. His landscapes paintings often depicting woodland scenes that were pastiches of the seventeenth century Dutch masters. His works during the 1830s were more successful, and displayed a freshness that was previously lacking. In 1834 he published his admired \"Scenery of the Rivers of Norfolk\", which consisted of thirty-six etchings produced by specialist engravers after his own paintings. This ambitious work was well-received at the time, but as with similar works published by other artists, it was financially unsuccessful.\n\nJames Stark was born in Norwich on 19 November 1794, the son of Michael Stark (1748–1831) and his wife Jane Ivory. He was christened on 30 November 1794 at the Church of St Michael Coslany, Norwich, close to the family home. James was the youngest son of eight siblings. His father Michael Stark was a Scottish-born dyer who had a considerable literary and scientific background, and who ran his own dyeing business on Duke Street, Norwich. He is credited with a number of innovations in the dyeing industry, including the invention of the formula of 'Norwich red'.\n\nJames Stark showed a talent for art from an early age. He was educated at Norwich School, where he became friends with John Berney Crome, the son of the artist (and his teacher) John Crome. Two of Stark's pencil drawings were exhibited in Norwich in 1809, and he exhibited for the first time in London in 1811, at the age of seventeen, when his painting \"A view on King Street river, Norwich\" was shown at the Royal Academy.\n\nBecause of his poor health, which dogged him throughout his life, his initial ambitions to become a farmer were never realised. In 1811 he was apprenticed for three years to John Crome. Two letters from Crome to his teenage pupil survive. One, dated 3 July 1814 and sent to Starks' house in London, contains a reminder to submit work to the Norwich Society of Artists' forthcoming exhibition. The second letter is considered by art historians to be important, as it reveals how Crome was able to impart his knowledge to his pupils. Amongst other suggestions, the letter encouraged Stark to consider using more \"breadth\". Crome was a strong influence on Stark, who was his favourite pupil, and Crome's preoccupation with depicting trees and woodland scenes led Stark to produce many such scenes himself. He was elected as a member of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1812. He exhibited at the British Institution between 1814 and 1818, winning a prize of £50 in 1818.\n\nIn 1814, following the end of his Norwich apprenticeship, Stark moved to London. There he befriended and became influenced by the artist William Collins. In 1817 he became a student at the Royal Academy. \"The Bathing Place, Morning\" was sold in 1817 to the Henry Hobart, the Dean of Windsor. For a short period he shared lodgings with the portrait painter Joseph Clover. During this period he began to sell paintings to wealthy patrons: both the Marquis of Stafford and the Countess de Grey bought works from him.\n\nAfter only two years of study in London, debilitating ill health forced him to return to Norwich, where he remained for nearly twenty years, until his final move from the city in 1830. There he devoted himself to painting the scenery around the city and executing a series of paintings of Norfolk rivers, which were eventually engraved and published in 1834. Regarded during his lifetime by his friends as one of the leaders of the Norwich School of painters, he was elected Vice-President of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1828 and President in the following year, at a time when the Society was struggling to survive.\n\nIn 1840 Stark moved to Windsor, where he lived for ten years. During this period in his life he painted many pictures of the scenery along the Thames and in Windsor Great Park, producing images of trees that revealed his improved understanding of their structure.\n\nOn 7 July 1821 he married Elizabeth Younge Dinmore of King's Lynn. In 1830, he moved to London, taking up residence in Beaumont Row, Chelsea. Elizabeth Stark died in 1834, three years after the birth of their son, Arthur James Stark. He moved back to London in 1849 to further his son's artistic education, residing at Mornington Place, Camden Town. James Stark died in March 1859. His body was interred in the family burial plot in the Rosary Cemetery, Norwich.\n\nStark mainly worked in oils, though he was also a watercolourist, and produced drawings in pencil and chalk. He initially followed his teacher John Crome in producing works with soft greys and pinks, in a style similar to that of Crome's \"Back of the New Mills\" (c. 1815). His first important success occurred the same year, when he exhibited \"The Bathing Place - Morning\". His \"Lambeth, looking towards Westminster Bridge\" (1818), now in the Yale Center for British Art collection in New Haven, Connecticut, provides an indication of Stark's initial technique, which Andrew Hemingway describes as \"a fairly broad style comparable with that of his fellow pupils\".\n\nStark's early paintings were followed by landscapes of a repetitive and stylized kind, generally depicting woodland glades, and for which he is generally best known today. These scenes fell into the trap of being \"a mere pastiche of the seventeenth formula\", containing ochre, red and green pigments to depict scenes containing poorly-drawn trees. Such works were exhibited under the title \"Landscape\". By 1825, the \"London Magazine\" was reporting that Stark's subject matter lacked development, tending as he did to base his works on the paintings of seventeenth-century Dutch masters such as Meindert Hobbema and Jacob van Ruisdael.\n\nBy the mid-1830s, Stark had moved away from the influence of the Dutch masters and was producing paintings that showed nature less heavily and more freely. These works have more descriptive titles. Not all his critics were pleased: the \"Norfolk Chronicle\" complained in 1829 of Stark's move away from depicting formulaic scenes towards a greater use of bright colours and more brilliant lighting effects. His work during this period in his artistic career became more successful, according to Hemingway. The numerous sketches of the Norfolk countryside he had previously produced gave his exhibited works a freshness that was previously lacking, and which was more appealing to the critics. \"Cromer\", exhibited at the British Institution in 1837, is a good example of this new kind of work, and shows the influence of his friend William Collins and the Norwich artist John Thirtle. Like many of his later works, it is based on earlier sketchwork.\n\nLike many painters of the Norwich School, Stark produced his own etchings, but these were not exhibited. As they generally lacked a title, they are nowadays difficult to identify and are little known. Geoffrey Searle, in his survey of the etchings produced by the Norwich School, describes Stark's own etchings as \"having a distinctive charm\". The article on Stark in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica noted that \"his works charm rather by their gentle truth and quietness of manner than by their robustness of view or by their decisiveness of execution\".\n\nJames Stark exhibited paintings throughout his working life. The Norwich Society of Artists, which was inaugurated in 1803 and held annual exhibitions almost continuously until 1833, exhibited 105 works by Stark from 1809-32, of which seventy-three were landscapes and four were of marine scenes.\n\nDuring his career he had many wealthy patrons and was regarded in London as a successful provincial artist. He was consistently praised by the Norfolk press. In 1817, when only twenty-three, he and his friend John Berney Crome had been praised in the \"Norwich Mercury\" \"for their great and rapid strides\". As well as exhibiting in London and Norwich, Stark had his paintings shown in exhibitions as far afield as Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dublin.\n\nStark wrote an essay \"On the moral and political influence of the Fine Arts\", published in the \"Norwich Mercury\" on 26 May 1827, criticising those who were apparently indifferent towards the financial plight of the Norwich Society of Artists. \n\nSubsequent exhibitions of works by Stark include an exhibition held in 1887.\n\nStark taught his own son Arthur, as well as Alfred Priest, Henry Jutsum and Samuel David Colkett, all of whom emerged to become minor artists. Their artistic styles were heavily influenced by their teacher, and none of them produced notable works of art. Arthur James Stark specialised in depicting landscapes and animals, and drew the cattle on a few of his father's pictures.\n\n\n"}

The elections saw the Malaysian ruling party, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), backed with Singapore Alliance Party (SAP) in an attempt to oust the People's Action Party (PAP), after violating previous agreement not to do so and a highlight in the relations between UMNO and the PAP. However, the result was a victory for the PAP, which won 37 of the 51 seats in the Singapore Legislative Assembly. The 1963 election was the only election to date with no boundary changes to any of the 51 existing constituencies.\n\nAs Singapore gained independence in 1965, this election was the only election that was held as a state of Malaysia. After independence, the elected members of the Legislative Assembly would then became Members of the inaugural Parliament of Singapore.\n\nAlthough the People's Action Party (PAP) had won 43 seats in the 1959 elections, they lost four seats in 1961 (two were from the by-election defeats, and two defected to the new United People's Party (UPP)). A further 13 legislators were expelled from PAP for voting against the government in a no-confidence motion on 20 July 1961; the dissidents subsequently formed a new party, the Barisan Sosialis (BS), alleging PAP as a communist front. The combination of by-election defeats, defections and expulsions reduced the PAP by 17 seats down to 26, leaving PAP with a one-seat majority.\n\nOn 3 July 1962, while the integration referendum debate was in procession, PAP lost its majority following the resignation of legislator Ho Puay Choo (who later joined BS on 11 August). Five days later, UPP legislator S. V. Lingam returned to PAP fold, giving it back its one-seat majority, but five days later, PAP lost its majority again after health minister Ahmad Ibrahim died from liver cancer. BS initially planned to field its iconic leader, Lim Chin Siong, in the vacated seat, but the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew opted against a by-election, and instead called a fresh election.\n\nOn 31 August 1963, Singapore was declared independent with PAP declared as trustees until the merger with Malaysia could be complete. On 3 September, Lee dissolved the Legislative Assembly in accordance with procedure, and called for elections to be held on 21 September.\n\nThe elections, held in the midst of Singapore's merger with Malaysia, are remembered as the PAP's most hard-fought election, as the party fielded a full slate and faced intensive challenges from three components that did nearly the same. BS collated with Parti Rakyat, and fielded candidates in all but two seats, while UPP had an unusual large number of candidates. The PAP government launched Operation Coldstore on 2 February 1963 and detained several BS leaders, including Lim.\n\nOn the final night of campaigning, PAP officials warned that should BS win the election and defeat PAP, the Malaysia Federal government could send troops into Singapore to invoke emergency powers in place of the incoming government led by the new pro-communist party, leaving no opportunity for BS to respond. This was said to have accounted for the eventual victory of the PAP the following day.\n\nThe sole Workers' Party (WP) legislator David Marshall resigned from the party he founded and became the only independent. Another participant was Singapore Alliance, an extension of the ruling federal Alliance Party in Malaysia, which was a coalition consisting of the Singapore People's Alliance (SPA) along with the local branches of UMNO, the Malayan Chinese Association and Malayan Indian Congress. However, former Chief Minister and leader Lim Yew Hock opted not to run in the elections, citing a defamation campaign by the PAP.\n\nThe PAP won a landslide victory, securing a two-thirds majority, an outcome that had been in doubt or unexpected in the lead-up to the vote. However, the party's vote share was its lowest-ever at just under 47%. Despite the BS and UPP winning a combined 14 seats, both parties failed to win most of the seats they contested, due to the split of the anti-PAP vote. A total of 92 candidates lost their deposits.\n\nThe Singapore Alliance lost all seven seats it had held before dissolution, losing even in core support areas such as Malay constituencies Kampong Kembangan, Geylang Serai and Southern Islands.\n\nNine incumbent members lost their re-election on the election, among which the defeats of Kenneth Michael Byrne and Tan Kia Gan (in the seats of Crawford and Paya Lebar, respectively) marked the first time a higher-ranked PAP cabinet minister had been defeated in their constituencies. This would not happen again until the 2011 elections, 48 years and 11 elections later, where cabinet ministers Lim Hwee Hua and George Yeo were defeated in his constituency of Aljunied.\n\nMany cited factors that led to the PAP victory include: \n\nTo discourage future defections, the PAP government passed a constitutional amendment stipulating that legislators who resign or are expelled from the parties they were elected under would lose their seats. As a result, by-elections were subsequently held in Hong Lim in 1965, seven constituencies in 1966 and five constituencies in 1967. Those victories resulted PAP in achieving a parliament monopoly that would last for the next 15 years until the first elected opposition MP in 1981.\n\nThe distribution of 15 Singapore seats in Malaysia's lower house of Parliament (Dewan Rakyat) was based on the outcome of the election. PAP was allocated 12, which were given to Prime Minister Lee, Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye, ministers Goh Keng Swee, Ong Pang Boon, S. Rajaratnam, Yong Nyuk Lin, Jek Yeun Thong, Lim Kim San, Othman Wok and assembly members Abdul Rahim Ishak, Wee Toon Boon and Ho See Beng. BS was allocated 3: Chia Thye Poh, Lim Huan Boon and Kow Kee Seng. \n"}

The species is endemic to desert areas along the western coast of South Africa. In 2011, it was moved to its own genus based on molecular phylogeny, but formerly it was included in the genus \"Cordylus\".\n\nThe armadillo girdled lizard can be a light brown to dark brown in coloration. The underbelly is yellow with a blackish pattern, especially under the chin. Its size can range from in snout-vent length (SVL). It may grow to a maximum size of SVL.\n\n\"O. cataphractus\" is endemic to the Succulent Karoo biome in the Northern and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa, where it occurs from the southern Richtersveld to the Piketberg Mountains and the southern Tankwa Karoo. It inhabits rock outcrops and mountain slopes, preferably on sandstone substrate.\n\nThe armadillo girdled lizard feeds mainly on small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders, but sometimes also may take plant material. In captivity, it is commonly fed crickets. In the wild, its most common prey items are termites, especially \"Microhodotermes viator\" and \"Hodotermes mossambicus\".\n\nThe armadillo girdled lizard is diurnal. It hides in rock cracks and crevices. It lives in social groups of up to 30 to 60 individuals of all ages, but usually fewer. Males are territorial, protecting a territory and mating with the females living there.\nThe armadillo girdled lizard possesses an uncommon antipredator adaptation, in which it takes its tail in its mouth and rolls into a ball when frightened. In this shape, it is protected from predators by the thick, squarish scales along its back and the spines on its tail. This behavior, which resembles that of the mammalian armadillo, gives it its English common names.\n\nThe female armadillo girdled lizard gives birth to one or two live young; the species is one of the few lizards that does not lay eggs. The female may even feed her young, which is also unusual for a lizard. Females give birth once a year at most; some take a year off between births.\n\nThe species \"Ouroborus cataphractus\" was classified by the IUCN as Vulnerable until 1996, but has since been downgraded to Least Concern. This is mostly due to a general cessation of collection for the pet trade, which was a significant drain on populations but is now illegal. The armadillo girdled lizard is thought to be somewhat susceptible to fluctuations in its primary foodsource (termites), which in turn can be impacted by climatic events such as changes in rainfall patterns, as well as to habitat changes through invasive alien plant species and poor fire management.\n\n\n"}

He studied at Middlebury College, Vermont, in 1838–1839, graduated at Yale in 1843, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, and studied at Harvard Law School in 1843–1844. In 1845 he went to London, where he was employed during most of the remainder of his life as a collector of Americana for the British Museum and for various public and private American libraries.\n\nHe was engaged by Sir Anthony Panizzi, librarian of the British Museum, to collect historical books, documents, journals, etc., concerning North and South America; and he was purchasing agent for the Smithsonian Institution and for the Library of Congress, as well as for James Lenox, of New York, for whom he secured much of the valuable Americana in the Lenox library in that city, and for the John Carter Brown library, at Providence, Rhode Island. He became a member of the Society of Antiquaries in 1852, and in 1877 was a member of the committee which organized the Caxton Exhibition, for which he catalogued the collection of Bibles. Stevens was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1854. He died at South Hampstead, England, on February 28, 1886. His brother, Benjamin Franklin Stevens, was also a bibliographer.\n\nHis principal compilations and publications were:\n\n\"In the year 1877 the late Mr. Henry Stevens of Vermont, under the pseudonym of ' Mr. Secretary Outis,' projected and initiated a literary Association entitled THE HERCULES CLUB. The following extracts from the original prospectus of that year explain this platform:\n\n\"The objects of this Association are literary, social, antiquarian, festive and historical ; and its aims are thoroughly independent research into the materials of early Anglo-American history and literature. The Association is known as THE HERCULES CLUB, whose Eurystheus is Historic Truth and whose appointed labours are to clear this field for the historian of the future.\" The founders of the club believed that many valuable historical documents of the Age of Discovery still awaited publication and selected ten topics for which members would contribute research and writings. The ambitious list of topics which they selected for their initial publication were as follows:\n\n\n\"The co-operative objects of the Association, however, appear never to have been fully inaugurated, although a large number of literary men, collectors, societies and libraries entered their names as Members of the Club. All were willing to give their pecuniary support as subscribers to the Club's publications, but few offered the more valuable aid of their literary assistance; hence practically the whole of the editing also devolved upon Mr. Henry Stevens.\n\n\"He first took up No. 10 on the above list, Hariot's Virginia. His long and diligent study for the introduction thereto, resulted in the discovery of so much new and important matter relative to Hariot and Raleigh, that it became necessary to embody it in a separate volume, as the maximum dimensions contemplated for the introduction to each work had been exceeded tenfold or more.\"\n\nOn Stevens' death in 1886, the completion of the project devolved upon his son Henry N. Stevens who assessed the situation as follows: \"Ever since 1886 I have from time to time unsuccessfully endeavoured to enlist the services of various editors competent to complete the projected eleven volumes of the Hercules Club publications, but after a lapse of nearly fourteen years I have awakened to the fact that no actual progress has been made, and that I have secured nothing beyond the vague promise of future assistance.\" However all was not lost. Mr Stevens (Jr.) found that \"On collating the printed stock I found that the two volumes, \"Hariot's Virginia\" and the \"Life of Hariot\", were practically complete, the text of both all printed off, and the titles and preliminary leaves and the Index to \"Hariot's Virginia\" actually standing in type at the Chiswick Press just as my father left them fourteen years ago!\" Thus it was not until 1900, almost 300 years after Hariot's death that the first serious biography appeared.\n\nEven so, the work was not widely distributed, only 162 copies had been printed and one of these deposited in the Harvard College Library. In 1972 the Burt Franklin Press, NYC, issued a reprint edition of the 'Life of Hariot\" making it finally available to the literary public. And so 350 years after Hariot's death the true story of his life began slowly to appear. The volume here referred to is titled:\n\nStevens consulted the records in the British Museum and found Hariot's will, but did not visit Petworth where the bulk of Hariot's papers were located. Also Stevens was not a mathematician and not equipped to evaluate properly Hariot's mathematical writings including his book on algebra (\"Artis Analyticae Praxis\") which was published posthumously (1631). In fact it is only in 2007 that a full translation into English has been completed.\n\n"}
{"id": "1890700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890700", "title": "Amelogenin", "text": "Amelogenin\n\nAmelogenins are a group of protein isoforms produced by alternative splicing or proteolysis from the \"AMELX\" gene, on the X chromosome, and also the \"AMELY\" gene in males, on the Y chromosome. They are involved in amelogenesis, the development of enamel. Amelogenins are type of extracellular matrix protein, which, together with ameloblastins, enamelins and tuftelins, direct the mineralization of enamel to form a highly organized matrix of rods, interrod crystal and proteins.\n\nAlthough the precise role of amelogenin(s) in regulating the mineralization process is unknown, it is known that amelogenins are abundant during amelogenesis. Developing human enamel contains about 70% protein, 90% of which are amelogenins.\n\nAmelogenins are believed to be involved in the organizing of enamel rods during tooth development. The latest research indicates that these proteins regulate the initiation and growth of hydroxyapatite crystals during the mineralization of enamel. In addition, amelogenins appear to aid in the development of cementum by directing cementoblasts to the tooth's root surface.\n\nThe amelogenin gene has been most widely studied in humans, where it is a single copy gene, located on the X and Y chromosomes at Xp22.1-Xp22.3 and Yp 11.2 [5]. The amelogenin gene’s location on sex chromosomes has implications for variability both between the X chromosome form (AMELX) and the Y chromosome form (AMELY), and between alleles of AMELY among different populations. This is because AMELY exists in the non-recombining region of chromosome Y, effectively isolating it from normal selection pressures. Other sources of amelogenin variation arise from the various isoforms of AMELX obtained from alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts. Specific roles for isoforms have yet to be established. Among other organisms, amelogenin is well conserved among eutherians, and has homologs in monotremes, reptiles and amphibians.\n\nDifferences between the X chromosome and Y chromosome versions of the amelogenin gene (AMELX and AMELY respectively) enable it to be used in sex determination of unknown human samples. AMELX’s intron 1 contains a 6-base-pair deletion relative to intron 1 of AMELY. This can be detected at low cost using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of intron 1, followed by gel electrophoresis. Two bands of DNA, at 555 bps and 371 bps, are resolved if both the AMELX and AMELY versions of the gene are present (i.e. the sample is from a male) or one band of DNA, at 555 bps, if the AMELX version only is present (i.e. the sample is from a female). \nHowever because of AMELY variation among individuals and populations, this method of sex determination is not 100% accurate. Mutation in regions of AMELY intron 1 commonly used as primer annealing sites may disable PCR amplification. A 6bp insertion to AMELY intron 1 results in an amplicon identical in length to that of AMELX. In some males AMELY may be deleted entirely. In any of these cases only one band is visualized during gel electrophoresis of PCR products, causing misidentification of the sample as female. The misidentification rate may vary among populations, but in general appears to be low. In one study in Spain, the amelogenin sex determination test using AMELX (977bps) and AMELY (790bps) bands was performed for 1224 individuals of known gender with a 99.84% (1222/1224) accuracy rate. Another study in India, however, found 5 of its 270 men studied (1.85%) possessed an AMELY deletion, terming them “deleted-amelogenin males” (DAMs). In response the authors suggested that while the amelogenin sex test may be accurate in general, other Y chromosome markers such as SRY, STR, or 50f2 can be used for less ambiguous gender identification.\n\nMutations in AMELX can cause amelogenesis imperfecta, a disorder of tooth enamel development.\n"}

{"id": "1890727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890727", "title": "Exponential smoothing", "text": "Exponential smoothing\n\nExponential smoothing is a rule of thumb technique for smoothing time series data using the exponential window function. Whereas in the simple moving average the past observations are weighted equally, exponential functions are used to assign exponentially decreasing weights over time. It is an easily learned and easily applied procedure for making some determination based on prior assumptions by the user, such as seasonality. Exponential smoothing is often used for analysis of time-series data.\n\nExponential smoothing is one of many window functions commonly applied to smooth data in signal processing, acting as low-pass filters to remove high-frequency noise. This method is preceded by Poisson's use of recursive exponential window functions in convolutions from the 19th century, as well as Kolmogorov and Zurbenko's use of recursive moving averages from their studies of turbulence in the 1940s.\n\nThe raw data sequence is often represented by formula_1 beginning at time formula_2, and the output of the exponential smoothing algorithm is commonly written as formula_3, which may be regarded as a best estimate of what the next value of formula_4 will be. When the sequence of observations begins at time formula_2, the simplest form of exponential smoothing is given by the formulas:\n\nformula_6\n\nwhere formula_7 is the \"smoothing factor\", and formula_8.\n\nThe use of the exponential window function is first attributed to Poisson as an extension of a numerical analysis technique from the 17th century, and later adopted by the signal processing community in the 1940s. Here, exponential smoothing is the application of the exponential, or Poisson, window function. Exponential smoothing was first suggested in the statistical literature without citation to previous work by Robert Goodell Brown in 1956, and then expanded by Charles C. Holt in 1957. The formulation below, which is the one commonly used, is attributed to Brown and is known as “Brown’s simple exponential smoothing”. All the methods of Holt, Winters and Brown may be seen as a simple application of recursive filtering, first found in the 1940s to convert FIR filters to IIR filters.\n\nThe simplest form of exponential smoothing is given by the formula:\n\nwhere \"α\" is the \"smoothing factor\", and 0 < \"α\" < 1. In other words, the smoothed statistic \"s\" is a simple weighted average of the current observation \"x\" and the previous smoothed statistic \"s\". The term \"smoothing factor\" applied to \"α\" here is something of a misnomer, as larger values of \"α\" actually reduce the level of smoothing, and in the limiting case with \"α\" = 1 the output series is just the current observation.\nSimple exponential smoothing is easily applied, and it produces a smoothed statistic as soon as two observations are available.\n\nValues of \"α\" close to one have less of a smoothing effect and give greater weight to recent changes in the data, while values of \"α\" closer to zero have a greater smoothing effect and are less responsive to recent changes. There is no formally correct procedure for choosing \"α\". Sometimes the statistician's judgment is used to choose an appropriate factor. Alternatively, a statistical technique may be used to \"optimize\" the value of \"α\". For example, the method of least squares might be used to determine the value of \"α\" for which the sum of the quantities formula_10 is minimized.\n\nUnlike some other smoothing methods, such as the simple moving average, this technique does not require any minimum number of observations to be made before it begins to produce results. In practice, however, a “good average” will not be achieved until several samples have been averaged together; for example, a constant signal will take approximately \"3\"/\"α\" stages to reach 95% of the actual value. To accurately reconstruct the original signal without information loss all stages of the exponential moving average must also be available, because older samples decay in weight exponentially. This is in contrast to a simple moving average, in which some samples can be skipped without as much loss of information due to the constant weighting of samples within the average. If a known number of samples will be missed, one can adjust a weighted average for this as well, by giving equal weight to the new sample and all those to be skipped.\n\nThis simple form of exponential smoothing is also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). Technically it can also be classified as an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (0,1,1) model with no constant term.\n\nThe time constant of an exponential moving average is the amount of time for the smoothed response of a unit set function to reach formula_11 of the original signal. The relationship between this time constant, formula_12, and the smoothing factor, formula_13, is given by the formula:\n\nWhere formula_15 is the sampling time interval of the discrete time implementation. If the sampling time is fast compared to the time constant (formula_16) then\n\nNote that in the definition above, \"s\" is being initialized to \"x\". Because exponential smoothing requires that at each stage we have the previous forecast, it is not obvious how to get the method started. We could assume that the initial forecast is equal to the initial value of demand; however, this approach has a serious drawback. Exponential smoothing puts substantial weight on past observations, so the initial value of demand will have an unreasonably large effect on early forecasts. This problem can be overcome by allowing the process to evolve for a reasonable number of periods (10 or more) and using the average of the demand during those periods as the initial forecast. There are many other ways of setting this initial value, but it is important to note that the smaller the value of \"α\", the more sensitive your forecast will be on the selection of this initial smoother value \"s\".\n\nFor every exponential smoothing method we also need to choose the value for the smoothing parameters. For simple exponential smoothing, there is only one smoothing parameter (\"α\"), but for the methods that follow there is usually more than one smoothing parameter.\n\nThere are cases where the smoothing parameters may be chosen in a subjective manner — the forecaster specifies the value of the smoothing parameters based on previous experience. However, a more robust and objective way to obtain values for the unknown parameters included in any exponential smoothing method is to estimate them from the observed data.\n\nThe unknown parameters and the initial values for any exponential smoothing method can be estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE). The errors are specified as formula_18 for t=1...,T (the one-step-ahead within-sample forecast errors). Hence we find the values of the unknown parameters and the initial values that minimize\n\nformula_19 \n\nUnlike the regression case (where we have formulae to directly compute the regression coefficients which minimize the SSE) this involves a non-linear minimization problem and we need to use an optimization tool to perform this.\n\nThe name 'exponential smoothing' is attributed to the use of the exponential window function during convolution. It is no longer attributed to Holt, Winters & Brown.\n\nBy direct substitution of the defining equation for simple exponential smoothing back into itself we find that\n\nIn other words, as time passes the smoothed statistic \"s\" becomes the weighted average of a greater and greater number of the past observations \"x\", and the weights assigned to previous observations are in general proportional to the terms of the geometric progression {1, (1 − \"α\"), (1 − \"α\"), (1 − \"α\"), ...}. A geometric progression is the discrete version of an exponential function, so this is where the name for this smoothing method originated according to Statistics lore.\n\nExponential smoothing and moving average have similar defects of introducing a lag relative to the input data. While this can be corrected by shifting the result by half the window length for a symmetrical kernel, such as a moving average or gaussian, it is unclear how appropriate this would be for exponential smoothing. They also both have roughly the same distribution of forecast error when \"α\" = 2/(\"k\"+1). They differ in that exponential smoothing takes into account all past data, whereas moving average only takes into account \"k\" past data points. Computationally speaking, they also differ in that moving average requires that the past \"k\" data points, or the data point at lag \"k\"+1 plus the most recent forecast value, to be kept, whereas exponential smoothing only needs the most recent forecast value to be kept.\n\nIn the signal processing literature, the use of non-causal (symmetric) filters is commonplace, and the exponential window function is broadly used in this fashion, but a different terminology is used: exponential smoothing is equivalent to a first-order Infinite Impulse Response or IIR filter and moving average is equivalent to a Finite Impulse Response filter with equal weighting factors.\n\nSimple exponential smoothing does not do well when there is a trend in the data, which is inconvenient. In such situations, several methods were devised under the name \"double exponential smoothing\" or \"second-order exponential smoothing,\" which is the recursive application of an exponential filter twice, thus being termed \"double exponential smoothing\". This nomenclature is similar to quadruple exponential smoothing, which also references its recursion depth. \nThe basic idea behind double exponential smoothing is to introduce a term to take into account the possibility of a series\nexhibiting some form of trend. This slope component is itself updated via exponential smoothing.\n\nOne method, sometimes referred to as \"Holt-Winters double exponential smoothing\" works as follows:\n\nAgain, the raw data sequence of observations is represented by {\"x\"}, beginning at time \"t\" = 0. We use {\"s\"} to represent the smoothed value for time \"t\", and {\"b\"} is our best estimate of the trend at time \"t\". The output of the algorithm is now written as \"F\", an estimate of the value of \"x\" at time for \"m\" > 0 based on the raw data up to time \"t\". Double exponential smoothing is given by the formulas\n\nAnd for t > 1 by\n\nwhere α is the \"data smoothing factor\", 0 < α < 1, and β is the \"trend smoothing factor\", 0 < β < 1.\n\nTo forecast beyond \"x\"\n\nSetting the initial value \"b\" is a matter of preference. An option other than the one listed above is (\"x\" - \"x\")/\"n\" for some \"n\" > 1.\n\nNote that \"F\" is undefined (there is no estimation for time 0), and according to the definition \"F\"=\"s\"+\"b\", which is well defined, thus further values can be evaluated.\n\nA second method, referred to as either Brown's linear exponential smoothing (LES) or Brown's double exponential smoothing works as follows.\n\nwhere \"a\", the estimated level at time \"t\" and \"b\", the estimated trend at time \"t\" are:\n\nTriple exponential smoothing applies exponential smoothing three times, which is commonly used when there are three high frequency signals to be removed from a time series under study. There are different types of seasonality: 'multiplicative' and 'additive' in nature, much like addition and multiplication are basic operations in mathematics.\n\nIf every month of December we sell 10,000 more apartments than we do in November the seasonality is \"additive\" in nature. However, if we sell 10% more apartments in the summer months than we do in the winter months the seasonality is \"multiplicative\" in nature. Multiplicative seasonality can be represented as a constant factor, not an absolute amount.\nTriple exponential smoothing was first suggested by Holt's student, Peter Winters, in 1960 after reading a signal processing book from the 1940s on exponential smoothing. Holt's novel idea was to repeat filtering an odd number of times greater than 1 and less than 5, which was popular with scholars of previous eras. While recursive filtering had been used previously, it was applied twice and four times to coincide with the Hadamard conjecture, while triple application required more than double the operations of singular convolution. The use of a triple application is considered a rule of thumb technique, rather than one based on theoretical foundations and has often been over-emphasized by practitioners.\n\nSuppose we have a sequence of observations {\"x\"}, beginning at time \"t\" = 0 with a cycle of seasonal change of length \"L\".\n\nThe method calculates a trend line for the data as well as seasonal indices that weight the values in the trend line based on where that time point falls in the cycle of length \"L\".\n\nThe output of the algorithm is again written as \"F\", an estimate of the value of \"x\" at time \"t+m, m>0\" based on the raw data up to time \"t\".

A demotion may also lead to the loss of other privileges associated with a more senior rank and/or a reduction in salary or benefits. An employee may be demoted for violating the rules of the organization by a behavior such as excessive lateness, misconduct, or negligence. In some cases, an employee may be demoted as an alternative to being laid off, if the employee has poor job performance or if the company is facing a financial crisis. A move to a position at the same rank or level elsewhere in the organization is called a lateral move or deployment. A voluntary move to a lower level is also a deployment as it is not a compulsory reduction in level. Demotion is often misinterpreted simply as the opposite of a promotion, however it is only one means of undergoing a reduction in work level.\n\nWithin the continuum of disciplinary options available within most organizations, a demotion falls in the middle range of severity. Minor violations of rules, or the first violation of a rule will typically result in a verbal or written warning or a suspension without pay. At the other extreme, for severe violations of the rules, such as embezzlement or sabotage, an employee will typically be fired and/or the company will file criminal or civil charges. In sports leagues, when teams are transferred between divisions, the worst-ranked teams in the higher division are relegated (or demoted) to the lower division.\nThe word \"demotion\" is not restricted to the world of employment; It can be used in a number of areas.\n\n"}
{"id": "1890739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890739", "title": "Malaysian Malaysia", "text": "Malaysian Malaysia\n\nThe phrase \"Malaysian Malaysia\" was originally used in the early 1960s as the rallying motto of the Malaysian Solidarity Council, a confederation of political parties formed to oppose Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia. This article specifically provides special quotas for the Malay and other indigenous peoples of Malaysia in admission to the public service, awarding of public scholarships, admission to public education institutions and the awarding of trade licences. It also authorises the government to create Malay monopolies in particular trades. The given reason for this affirmative action was carried out because the Malays and other aborigines were discriminated against employment during over 100 years of British colonial rule. British colonised Malaysia from 1786 to 1957 after the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. During these years, the British refused to employ Malay Indonesians and Malaysians, preferring to employ only Chinese and Indians.\n\nCritics have called such affirmative action for the Malays to be racial discrimination against other Malaysian citizens, with the goal of creating \"ketuanan Melayu\" (Malay supremacy). \"Malaysian Malaysia\" is not a mere tautology, because it distinguishes between nationality and ethnic classification. The complaint was that Malaysia was not being \"Malaysian\" by discriminating against non-Malays and was rather being a \"Malay Malaysia\".\n\nThe phrase \"Malaysian Malaysia\" is widely associated with Lee Kuan Yew, then leader of the Singapore-based People's Action Party (PAP), the prime constituent in the Malaysian Solidarity Convention; who was foremost a critic against the racial policy.\n\nIn a speech, Lee scoffed at what he viewed as the discriminatory social contract in the constitution that allowed citizenship to non-Malays while providing for special programs and policies for Malays: \"According to history, the Perak Man was believed to survive in Malaysia 10,000 years ago and more skeletons were found in Sarawak indicating the human living there since 3,000 – 4,000 years ago. Of the 50.1% percent Malays in Malaysia today, about one-third are comparatively new immigrants like the secretary-general of UMNO, Dato' Syed Ja'afar Albar, who came to Malaya from Indonesia just before the war at the age of more than thirty. Therefore the supporters of \"Malaysian Malaysia\" argue that it is wrong and illogical for a particular ethnic group to think that they are more entitled to be called Malaysians than others, and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour.\"\n\nThe campaign for a \"Malaysian Malaysia\" was not viewed highly by the government of Malaysia and the parties in the ruling coalition of the Alliance (later the Barisan Nasional). \nThose against the concept of a Malaysian Malaysia cited the fact that Malaya was progressively colonised by the British from the mid-19th century to its height in 1926. During this period, a large number of immigrant labourers, including Chinese and Indian peoples, came to Malaysia and Singapore. They suggest that during the colonial era, the Malays were forced to accommodate other peoples. Those historic immigrants and their descendants allowed to remain after the nation achieved independence should understand their presence was a privilege, not a right. Such people said that the influx of immigrants had negatively affected the rights and resources of the Malays. The argument was made in spite of the existence of Malay-Chinese Peranakans since the late 18th century, as well as regular Chinese merchant presence in Malaya long before the arrival of the British.\n\nSome politicians in the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) thought Malaysian Malaysia threatened the Malays' special position in Malaysia. They considered Lee to be a dangerous and seditious trouble-maker; one politician called him a traitor to the country. The more moderate Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, was perturbed by the campaign. He thought it would lead to trouble, as he believed that the Malays were not ready to compete without their special privileges. Eventually, Singapore was expelled from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965.\n\nIn 1999, controversy was reignited when Lim Kit Siang of the Democratic Action Party (DAP, the former Malaysian branch of the PAP) called for a second campaign for a \"Malaysian Malaysia\". Then acting UMNO Youth Chief Hishamuddin Hussein angrily responded with a warning not to \"play with fire,\" and accused Lim of politicising an issue that had been decided at independence with the social contract. Lim argued that the concept of a Malaysian Malaysia did not differ much from the government policy of establishing a \"Bangsa Malaysia\" (Malaysian race or Malaysian nation). Some noted that Hishamuddin's grandfather, Dato' Onn Ja'afar, the founder of UMNO, had left the party to form the Independence of Malaya Party based on the concept of eliminating special privileges for the Malays.\n\nIn 2006, at the Johor UMNO convention, Johor Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) Abdul Ghani Othman linked the \"Malaysian Malaysia\" campaign to those advocating the \"Bangsa Malaysia\" concept, insinuating that \"Bangsa Malaysia\" was a threat to the Bumiputra/Malay privileges granted under Article 153 of the Constitution. However, others criticised Ghani, with Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak stating: \"It (\"Bangsa Malaysia\") does not question the special rights of the Malays, our quota or anything of that sort.\"\n\n1Malaysia or One Malaysia (Malay: Satu Malaysia) is a Malaysian idea introduced by the sixth Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Tun Razak on 5 April 2009. The main motto is People First; Performance Now (Rakyat Didahulukan, Pencapaian Diutamakan). 1Malaysia concept according to YAB Dato'Sri Mohd Najib Tun Abdul Razak explanation: \"We stand, we think and act as a Malaysia race. And we take actions based on the needs of all ethnic groups in our country; (\"Kita berdiri, kita berfikir dan bertindak sebagai bangsa Malaysia. Dan kita mengambil tindakan-tindakan berdasarkan kehendak semua kumpulan etnik dalam negara kita;). While 1Malaysia does not seek to do away with Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution it does place a strong emphasis on protecting the rights and welfare of non-Malays. This means that 1Malaysia still doesn't provide an equal right for all citizens as per 1960s Malaysian Malaysia associated to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew which later then became the prime minister the Republic of Singapore. 1Malaysia concept is to harmonise citizens of the country regardless of race without changing its racial identity.\n\nIntegration under 1Malaysia is different from assimilation concept where the identity of various races were wiped out and replaced by a common national identity. Instead 1Malaysia appreciate and respect principals of Federal Constitution and ethnic identity of various races in Malaysia, and consider it as an asset or an advantage that can be proud of. 1Malaysia stressed an acceptance attitude within multi-racial citizens society, where a race/ethnic accept the racial differences of others in order for all to live together by respecting each other as a citizen in one country.\n\n"}

{"id": "1890743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890743", "title": "Fall of Tenochtitlan", "text": "Fall of Tenochtitlan\n\nThe Fall of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, was a decisive event in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire.\n\nIt occurred in 1521 following extensive manipulation of local factions and exploitation of preexisting divisions by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, who was aided by the support of his indigenous allies and his interpreter and companion La Malinche.\n\nAlthough numerous battles were fought between the Aztec Empire and the Spanish-led coalition, which was itself composed primarily of indigenous (mostly Tlaxcaltec) personnel, it was the siege of Tenochtitlan—its outcome probably largely determined by the effects of a smallpox epidemic (which devastated the Aztec population and dealt a severe blow to the Aztec leadership while leaving an immune Spanish leadership intact)—that directly led to the downfall of the Aztec civilization and marked the end of the first phase of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire.\n\nThe conquest of Mexico was a critical stage in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Ultimately, Spain conquered Mexico and thereby gained substantial access to the Pacific Ocean, which meant that the Spanish Empire could finally achieve its original oceanic goal of reaching the Asian markets.\n\nIn April 1519 Hernán Cortés, an ambitious nobleman recently landed in Cuba, and the leader of the third Spanish expedition to the coast of Mexico, landed as directed by the survivors of the previous two expeditions at San Juan de Ulúa, a good harbour on Mexico's east coast, with 508 soldiers, 100 sailors, and 14 small cannons. Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the Governor of Cuba, called for Cortés to lead an expedition into Mexico after favourable reports from two previous expeditions to Yucatán caught the interest of the Spanish in Cuba. Under the pressure of his relatives who had a different leader in mind, Velázquez regretted his decision and revoked Cortés' mandate to lead the expedition even before Cortés left Cuba. Thus Cortés had to fight for his survival as a leader while still in Cuba; twice messengers from Velázquez arrived to depose him, and twice they were spoken to with honeyed words and dissuaded from executing their mission. After Cortés sailed, Velázquez sent an army led by Pánfilo de Narváez to take him into custody.\n\nBut Cortés used the same legal tactic used by Governor Velázquez when he invaded Cuba years before: he created a local government and had himself elected as the magistrate, thus (in theory) making him responsible only to the King of Spain. Cortés followed this tactic when he and his men established the city of \"Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz\", also known as Veracruz, seven miles from the harbour of San Juan de Ulúa. An inquiry into Cortés' action was conducted in Spain in 1529 and no action was taken against him.\n\nCortés chanced to land at the borders of Cempoala, a recently Aztec-subdued vassal state with many grievances against them. Coming into contact with a number of polities who resented Aztec rule, Cortés claimed he has arrived on the orders of his Emperor to put things in order, abolish human sacrifices, teach the locals the true faith and \"stop them from robbing each other\", and was successful in enforcing excellent behaviour of his army when among potential allies. Cortés clashed with some of these polities, among them the Totonacs and Tlaxcalans. The latter gave him two good day battles and one night battle, and kept up a strong defence, holding off his army on a hilltop for two weeks. His numerically inferior force finally triumphed when the minds of Tlaxcalans opened up to consideration of his ceaseless offers of peace, notably Xicotencatl the Elder and his wish to form an alliance with the Spaniards against the Aztecs which was the proffered aim of Cortés as well.\n\nIt once was widely believed that the Aztecs first thought Cortés was Quetzalcoatl, a mythical god prophesied to return to Mexico—coincidentally in the same year Cortés landed and from the same direction he came. This is now believed to be an invention of the conquerors, and perhaps natives who wished to rationalize the actions of the Aztec \"tlatoani\", Moctezuma II. Most scholars agree that the Aztecs, especially the inner circle around Moctezuma, were well convinced that Cortés was not a god in any shape or form. Messages between Cortés and Moctezuma, however, frequently allude to the legend, which was widely known across the Aztec dominions to both Aztecs and their subjects, and strongly influenced them, as Bernal Díaz del Castillo repeatedly mentions.\n\nMoctezuma sent a group of noblemen and other emissaries to meet Cortés at Quauhtechcac. These emissaries brought golden jewelry as a gift, which greatly pleased the Spaniards. According to the Florentine Codex, Lib. 12, f.6r., Moctezuma also ordered that his messengers carry the highly symbolic \"penacho\" (headdress) of Quetzalcoatl de Tula to Cortés and place it on his person. As news about the strangers reached the capital city, Moctezuma became increasingly fearful and considered fleeing the city but resigned himself to what he considered to be the fate of his people.\n\nCortés continued on his march towards Tenochtitlan. Before entering the city, on November 8, 1519, Cortés and his troops prepared themselves for battle, armoring themselves and their horses, and arranging themselves in proper military rank. Four horsemen were at the lead of the procession. Behind these horsemen were five more contingents: foot soldiers with iron swords and wooden or leather shields; horsemen in cuirasses, armed with iron lances, swords, and wooden shields; crossbowmen; more horsemen; soldiers armed with arquebuses; lastly, native peoples from Tlaxcalan, Tliliuhquitepec, and Huexotzinco. The indigenous soldiers wore cotton armor and were armed with shields and crossbows; many carried provisions in baskets or bundles while others escorted the cannons on wooden carts.\n\nCortés' army entered the city on the flower-covered causeway from Iztapalapa, associated with the god Quetzalcoatl. Cortés was amicably received by Moctezuma. The captive woman Malinalli Tenépal, also known as Doña Marina, translated from Nahuatl to Chontal Maya; the Spaniard Gerónimo de Aguilar translated from Chontal Maya to Spanish.\n\nMoctezuma was soon taken hostage on November 14, 1519, as a safety measure by the vastly outnumbered Spanish. Another reason for his sudden capture was news that Moctezuma received from one of his messengers. It was reported to Moctezuma that at least eight hundred more Spaniards in thirteen great ships had arrived on the coast. Moctezuma received this information a few days before Cortés did. Cortés had been communicating to the crown that he had the entire situation under control and was practically running the city of Tenochtitlan. With the vast new Spanish ships forces on the horizon, sent by his enemy Diego Velázquez, they could only revoke his commission and recall him, thus ending his campaign in Mexico and probably dooming the Spanish attempt for a lightning conquest, as no other Spanish leader could wield authority as effectively both among the natives and the Spaniards. Therefore, Cortés made the decision to abruptly abduct the tlatoani; only with a knife to his throat could Cortés ensure his cooperation. According to all eyewitness accounts, Moctezuma initially refused to leave his palace but after a series of threats from and debates with the Spanish captains, and assurances from Doña Marina, he agreed to move to the Axayáctal palace with his retinue. The first captain assigned to guard him was Pedro de Alvarado. Other Aztec lords were also detained by the Spanish, when they started questioning their captive tlatoani's authority. The palace was surrounded by over 100 Spanish soldiers in order to prevent any attempt at rescue.\n\nIt is uncertain why Moctezuma cooperated so readily with the Spaniards. It is possible he feared losing his life or political power; however, one of the effective threats wielded by Cortés was the destruction of his beautiful city in the case of fighting between Spaniards and Aztecs (which ultimately came to pass). This Moctezuma at all costs wanted to avoid, vacillating and deferring the rupture until this policy claimed his life. It was clear from the beginning that he was ambivalent about who Cortés and his men really were, whether they be gods, descendants of a god, ambassadors from a greater king, or just barbaric invaders. From the perspective of the tlatoani, the Spaniards might have been assigned some decisive role by fate. It could also have been a tactical move: Moctezuma may have wanted to gather more information on the Spaniards, or to wait for the end of the agricultural season and strike at the beginning of the war season. However, he did not carry out either of these actions even though high-ranking military leaders such as his brother Cuitlahuac and nephew Cacamatzin urged him to do so.\n\nWith Moctezuma captive, Cortés did not need to worry about being cut off from supplies or being attacked, although some of his captains had such concerns. He also assumed that he could control the Aztecs through Moctezuma. However, Cortés had little knowledge of the ruling system of the Aztecs; Moctezuma was not all-powerful as Cortés imagined. Being appointed to and maintaining the position of tlatoani was based on the ability to rule decisively; he could be replaced by another noble if he failed to do so. At any sign of weakness, Aztec nobles within Tenochtitlan and in other Aztec tributaries were liable to rebel. As Moctezuma complied with orders issued by Cortés, such as commanding tribute to be gathered and given to the Spaniards, his authority was slipping, and quickly his people began to turn against him.\n\nCortés and his army were permitted to stay in the Palace of Axayacatl, and tensions continued to grow. While the Spaniards were in Tenochtitlan, Velázquez assembled a force of nineteen ships, more than 1400 soldiers with twenty cannons, eighty horsemen, one-hundred and twenty crossbowmen, and eighty arquebusiers under the command of Pánfilo de Narváez to capture Cortés and return him to Cuba. Velázquez felt that Cortés had exceeded his authority, and had been aware of Cortés's misconduct for nearly a year. He had to wait for favorable winds, though, and was unable to send any forces until spring. Narváez's troops landed at San Juan de Ulúa on the Gulf of Mexico coast around April 20, 1520.\n\nAfter Cortés became aware of their arrival, he left Pedro de Alvarado in charge in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers, and brought all his forces (about two hundred and forty men) by quick marches to Narváez's camp in Cempohuallan on May 27. Several negotiations between the two Spaniards took place on the way, in which Cortés was able to persuade many persons of weight in Narváez's camp to incline to his side. Cortés attacked Narváez's camp late at night; his men, much superior in experience and organization, wounded Narváez in the eye and took him as a hostage quickly; also taken were his principal adherents, de Salvatierra and Diego Velasquez (the nephew of the Governor of Cuba). Evidence suggests that the two were in the midst of negotiations at the time, and Narváez was not expecting an attack. Cortés then completed winning over Narváez's captains with promises of the vast wealth in Tenochtitlan, inducing them to follow him back to the Aztec capital. Narváez was imprisoned in Vera Cruz, and his army was integrated into Cortés's forces.\n\nDuring Cortés's absence, Pedro de Alvarado was left in command in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers.\n\nAt this time, the Aztecs began to prepare for the annual festival of Toxcatl in early May, in honor of Tezcatlipoca, otherwise known as the Smoking Mirror or the Omnipotent Power. They honored this god during the onset of the dry season so that the god would fill dry streambeds and cause rain to fall on crops. Moctezuma secured the consent of Cortés to hold the festival, and again confirmed permission with Alvarado.\n\nAlvarado agreed to allow the festival on the condition that there would be no human sacrifice, but the Toxcatl festival had featured human sacrifice as the main part of its climactic rituals. The sacrifice involved the killing of a young man who had been impersonating the Toxcatl deity for a full year. Thus, prohibiting human sacrifice during this festival was an untenable proposition for the Aztecs.\n\nBefore the festival, Alvarado encountered a group of women building a statue of Huitzilopochtli and the image unsettled him, and he became suspicious about the eventuality of human sacrifice. He tortured priests and nobles and discovered that the Aztecs were planning a revolt. Unable to assert control over events, he sequestered Moctezuma and increased the guards around the tlatoani.\n\nBy the day of the festival, the Aztecs had gathered on the Patio of Dances. Alvarado had sixty of his men as well as many of his Tlaxcalan allies into positions around the patio. The Aztecs initiated the Serpent Dance. The euphoric dancing as well as the accompanying flute and drum playing disturbed Alvarado about the potential for revolt. He ordered the gates closed and initiated the killing of many thousands of Aztec nobles, warriors and priests.\n\nAlvarado, the conquistadors and the Tlaxcalans retreated to their base in the Palace of Axayacatl and secured the entrances. Alvarado ordered his men to shoot their cannons, crossbows and arquebuses into the gathering crowd. The result either preempted or triggered the Aztec revolt, which was, however, inevitable from the moment of Moctezuma's capture and was accelerated by the split of the Spanish forces. Alvarado forced Moctezuma to appeal to the crowd outside the Palace and this appeal temporarily calmed them.\n\nThe massacre had the result of resolutely turning all the Aztecs against the Spanish and completely undermining Moctezuma's authority.\n\nAlvarado sent word to Cortés of the events, and Cortés hurried back to Tenochtitlan on June 24 with 1,300 soldiers, 96 horses, 80 crossbowmen, and 80 arquebusiers. Cortés also came with 2,000 Tlaxcalan warriors on the journey. Cortés entered the palace unscathed, as the hostilities had not started yet, although the Aztecs had probably planned to ambush him. The Aztecs had already stopped sending food and supplies to the Spaniards. They became suspicious and watched for people trying to sneak supplies to them; many innocent people were slaughtered because they were suspected of helping them. A few days after the great forces of Cortés got into Tenochtitlan, the roads were shut and the causeway bridges were raised. The Aztecs halted any Spanish attacks or attempts to leave the palace. Every Spanish soldier that was not killed was wounded.\n\nCortés failed to grasp the full extent of the situation, as the attack on the festival was the last straw for the Aztecs, who now were completely against Moctezuma and the Spanish. The military gains of the attack therefore had a serious political cost for Cortés. His new followers were greatly disturbed at the power of the Aztecs, and held Cortés to be a liar since nobody revered them and brought them food and gifts as Cortés had promised.\n\nCortés attempted to parlay with the Aztecs, and after this failed he sent Moctezuma to tell his people to stop fighting. However, the Aztecs refused. The Spanish asserted that Moctezuma was stoned to death by his own people as he attempted to speak with them. Three stones hit him, one of them on the head, so cerebral hematoma is possible. Moctezuma refused all medical help as well as food, and died soon after the attack. The Aztecs later claimed that Moctezuma had been murdered by the Spanish. Two other local rulers were found strangled as well. Moctezuma's younger brother Cuitláhuac, who had been ruler of Ixtlapalapan until then, was chosen as the Tlatoani.\n\nThe flight of the Spanish from Tenochtitlan was a crushing defeat for Cortés that was just short of annihilation. It is still remembered as \"La Noche Triste,\" The Night of Sorrows. Popular tales say Cortés wept under a tree the night of the massacre of his troops at the hands of the Aztecs.\n\nInitially, Cortés resolved to fight the Aztec troops opposed to him and win the city in direct conflict. This stemmed from three errors of judgment:\n\n1. Underestimation of the Aztecs. Cortés fought the Tabascans, the Cempoalans, the Tlaxcalans and found them strong opponents, but always prevailed. He had never fought an Aztec army before and did not expect such resolve and martial skill as he encountered – although all his previous foes warned that the Mexicans were the greatest warriors they had ever seen and could not be withstood within their city.\n\n2. Overrating his forces. Since Cortés won all his battles in Mexico before this while at the head of much inferior forces, being in charge of a nearly full Spanish tercio must have made him feel invincible. In fact, the only serviceable portion of his army were his old followers with great experience of Mexican warfare, who were by this time severely whittled down by wounds and disease. The newly-arrived Narvaéz's men did not have experience in local fighting and were worth much less in combat - and eventually perished in much greater numbers than the veterans.\n\n3. Unprepared for enemy tactics. The Aztecs had fought for the lake cities many times before and their tactics were excellent - the use of canoes, the use of flat roofs with prepared missiles, dropping down into the lake when cornered, and destroying bridges. Cavalry could not operate in these conditions and control of the water was crucial, which Cortés did not realize at first.\n\nWith this mindset, Cortés launched an attack directly at the chief temple of the city, the Cue of Huichilopotzli. In spite of determined opposition, the Spanish push got them to the top of the temple's 114 steps, but at a great loss. Cortés aimed at routing the Aztecs and by holding both Moctezuma and the great temple - being able to offer peace once again. However, the Spanish attack encountered such fierce resistance and numerous fatalities among his men, that the plan fell apart. The retreat to Spanish quarters was as hard as the attack, and part of their quarters were plundered in the meantime. The direct loss of nearly a hundred men dead and the fierce spirit of the Aztecs who refused to be cowed by his ascent of the temple convinced Cortés that a night escape was now his only option for survival.\n\nThough a flight from the city would make Cortés appear weak before his indigenous allies, it was this or death for the Spanish forces. Cortés and his men were in the center of the city, and would most likely have to fight their way out no matter what direction they took. Cortés wanted to flee to Tlaxcala, so a path directly east would have been most favorable. Nevertheless, this would require hundreds of canoes to move all of Cortés's people and supplies, which he was unable to procure in his position.\n\nCortés therefore had to choose among three land routes: north to Tlatelolco, which was the least dangerous path but required the longest trip through the city; south to Coyohuacan and Iztapalapa, two towns that would not welcome the Spanish; or west to Tlacopan, which required the shortest trip through Tenochtitlan, though they would not be welcome there either. Cortés decided on the west causeway to Tlacopan, needing the quickest route out of Tenochtitlan with all his provisions and people.\n\nHeavy rains and a moonless night provided some cover for the escaping Spanish. On that \"Sad Night,\" July 1, 1520, the Spanish forces exited the palace first with their indigenous allies close behind, bringing as much treasure as possible. Cortés had hoped to go undetected by muffling the horses' hooves and carrying wooden boards to cross the canals.\nThe Spanish forces were able to pass through the first three canals, the Tecpantzinco, Tzapotlan, and Atenchicalco.\n\nHowever, they were discovered on the fourth canal at Mixcoatechialtitlan. One account says a woman fetching water saw them and alerted the city, another says it was a sentry. Some Aztecs set out in canoes, others by road to Nonchualco then Tlacopan to cut the Spanish off. The Aztecs attacked the fleeing Spanish on the Tlacopan causeway from canoes, shooting arrows at them. The Spanish fired their crossbows and arquebuses, but were unable to see their attackers or get into formation. Many Spaniards leaped into the water and drowned, weighed down by armor and booty.\n\nWhen faced with a gap in the causeway, Alvarado made the famous \"leap of Alvarado\" using a spear to get to the other side. Approximately a third of the Spaniards succeeding in reaching the mainland, while the remaining ones died in battle or were captured and later sacrificed on Aztec altars - these were reported to be mostly the followers of Narváez, less experienced and more weighted down with gold, which was handed out freely before the escape.\n\nAfter crossing over the bridge, the surviving Spanish had little reprieve before the Aztecs appeared to attack and chase them towards Tlacopan. When they arrived at Tlacopan, a good number of Spaniards had been killed, as well as most of the indigenous warriors, and some of the horses; all of the cannons and most of the crossbows and other weapons were lost. In all battles with main Aztec forces after that, Spaniards noted their lost arms being used against them. The Spanish finally found refuge in Otancalpolco, where they were aided by the Teocalhueyacans. The morning after, the Aztecs returned to recover the spoils from the canals.\n\nTo reach Tlaxcala, Cortés had to bring his troops around Lake Texcoco. Though the Spanish were under attack the entire trip, because Cortés took his troops through the northern towns, they were at an advantage. The northern valley was less populous, travel was difficult, and it was still the agricultural season, so the attacks on Cortés's forces were not very heavy. As Cortés arrived in more densely inhabited areas east of the lake, the attacks were more forceful.\n\nBefore reaching Tlaxcala, the scanty Spanish forces arrived at the plain of Otumba Valley (Otompan), where they were met by a vast Aztec army intent on their destruction. The Aztecs intended to cut short the Spanish retreat from Tenochtitlan and annihilate them. Here, the Aztecs made their own errors of judgement by underestimating the shock value of the Spanish caballeros because all they had seen was the horses traveling gingerly on the wet paved streets of Tenochtitlan. They had never seen them used in open battle on the plains. By marshalling on an open plain, they also allowed experienced Spanish commanders to bring to bear their own tactics, weaponry, and the know-how of European warfare.\n\nDespite the overwhelming numbers of Aztecs and the generally poor condition of the Spanish survivors, Cortés snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. He spotted the Aztec commander in his ornate and colourful feather tlahuiztli and immediately charged him with several horsemen, killing the Aztec commander and most other leaders as they were clearly marked by their golden plumage and an easy target for a charge. The many Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish are mentioned as playing an important role in the battle, armed with Spanish swords and shields. The Spanish suffered some losses, but were victorious over the Aztecs, who then retreated and were pursued by cavalry.\n\nWhen Cortés finally reached Tlaxcala five days after fleeing Tenochtitlan, he had lost over 860 Spanish soldiers, over a thousand Tlaxcalans, as well as Spanish women who had accompanied Narváez's troops. Cortés claimed only 15 Spaniards were lost along with 2,000 native allies. Cano, another primary source, gives 1,150 Spaniards dead, though this figure was likely too high and might encompass the total loss from entering Mexico to arriving into Tlaxcala. Cortés' chaplain back in Spain, Francisco López de Gómara, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies had died. Other sources estimate that nearly half of the Spanish and almost all of the natives were killed or wounded.\n\nThe women survivors included Cortés's translator and lover La Malinche, María Estrada, and two of Moctezuma's daughters who had been given to Cortés, including the emperor's favorite and reportedly most beautiful daughter Tecuichpotzin (later Doña Isabel Moctezuma). A third daughter died, leaving behind her infant by Cortés, the mysterious second \"María\" named in his will.\n\nCuitláhuac had been elected as the emperor immediately following Moctezuma's death. It was necessary for him to prove his power and authority to keep the tributaries from revolting. Usually, the new king would take his army on a campaign before coronation; this demonstration would solidify necessary ties. However, Cuitláhuac was not in a position to do this, as it was not yet war season; therefore, allegiance to the Spanish seemed to be an option for many tributaries. The Aztec empire was very susceptible to division: most of the tributary states were divided internally, and their loyalty to the Aztecs was based either on their own interests or fear of punishment.\n\nIt was necessary for Cortés to rebuild his alliances after his escape from Tenochtitlan before he could try again to take the city. He started with the Tlaxcalans. Tlaxcala was an autonomous state, and a fierce enemy of the Aztecs. Another strong motivation to join forces with the Spanish was that Tlaxcala was encircled by Aztec tributaries. The Tlaxcalans could have crushed the Spaniards at this point or turned them over to the Aztecs. In fact, the Aztecs sent emissaries promising peace and prosperity if they would do just that. The Tlaxcalan leaders rebuffed the overtures of the Aztec emissaries, deciding to continue their friendship with Cortés.\n\nCortés managed to negotiate an alliance; however, the Tlaxcalans required heavy concessions from Cortés for their continued support, which he was to provide after they defeated the Aztecs. They expected the Spanish to pay for their supplies, to have the city of Cholula, an equal share of any of the spoils, the right to build a citadel in Tenochtitlan, and finally, to be exempted from any future tribute. Cortés was willing to promise anything in the name of the King of Spain, and agreed to their demands. The Spanish did complain about having to pay for their food and water with their gold and other jewels with which they had escaped Tenochtitlan. The Spanish authorities would later disown this treaty with the Tlaxcalans after the fall of Tenochtitlan.\n\nCortés needed to gain other new allies as well. If the Spaniards were able to prove they could protect their new allies from the possibility of Aztec retribution, changing sides would not be too difficult for other tributaries. After Cortés' forces managed to defeat the smaller armies of some Aztec tributary states, Tepeyac, and later, Yauhtepec and Cuauhnahuac were easily won over. Cortés also used political maneuvering to assure the allegiance of other states, such as Tetzcoco. In addition, Cortés replaced kings with those who he knew would be loyal to him. Cortés now controlled many major towns, which simultaneously bolstered Cortés's forces while weakening the Aztecs.\n\nThough the largest group of indigenous allies were Tlaxcalans, the Huexotzinco, Atlixco, Tliliuhqui-Tepecs, Tetzcocans, Chalca, Alcohua and Tepanecs were all important allies as well, and had all been previously subjugated by the Aztecs.\n\nEven the former Triple Alliance member, city of Tetzcoco (or Texcoco) became a Spanish ally. As the rebellion attempt led by the Tetzcocan Tlatoani, Cacamatzin, in times of Moctezuma's reclusion was conjured by the Spanish, Cortés named one of Cacamatzin's brothers as new tlatoani. He was Ixtlilxóchitl II, who had disagreed with his brother and always proved friendly to the Spanish. Later, Cortés also occupied the city as base for the construction of brigantines. However, one faction of Tetzcocan warriors remained loyal to the Aztecs.\n\nCortés had to put down internal struggles among the Spanish troops as well. The remaining Spanish soldiers were somewhat divided; many wanted nothing more than to go home, or at the very least to return to Vera Cruz and wait for reinforcements. Cortés hurriedly quashed this faction, determined to finish what he had started. Not only had he staked everything he had or could borrow on this enterprise, he had completely compromised himself by defying his superior Velázquez. He knew that in defeat he would be considered a traitor to Spain, but that in success he would be its hero. So he argued, cajoled, bullied and coerced his troops, and they began preparing for the siege of Mexico. In this Cortés showed skill at exploiting the divisions within and between the Aztec states while hiding those of his own troops.\n\nWhile Cortés was rebuilding his alliances and garnering more supplies, a smallpox epidemic struck the natives of the Valley of Mexico, including Tenochtitlan. The disease was probably carried by a Spanish slave from Narváez's forces, who had been abandoned in the capital during the Spanish flight. Smallpox played a crucial role in the Spanish success during the Siege of Tenochtitlan from 1519–1521, a fact not mentioned in some historical accounts. The disease broke out in Tenochtitlan in late October 1520. The epidemic lasted sixty days, ending by early December.\n\nIt was at this event where firsthand accounts were recorded in the Florentine Codex concerning the adverse effects of the smallpox epidemic of the Aztecs, which stated, \"many died from this plague, and many others died of hunger. They could not get up and search for food, and everyone else was too sick to care for them, so they starved to death in their beds. By the time the danger was recognized, the plague was well established that nothing could halt it\". The smallpox epidemic caused not only infection to the Mexica peoples, but it weakened able bodied people who could no longer grow and harvest their crops, which in turn led to mass famine and death from malnutrition. While the population of Tenochtitlan was recovering, the disease continued to Chalco, a city on the southeast corner of Lake Texcoco that was formerly controlled by the Aztecs but now occupied by the Spanish.\n\nReproduction and population growth declined since people of child-bearing age either had to fight off the Spanish invasion or died due to famine, malnutrition or other diseases. Diseases like smallpox could travel great distances and spread throughout large populations, which was the case with the Aztecs having lost approximately 50% of its population from smallpox and other diseases. The disease killed an estimated forty percent of the native population in the area within a year. The Aztecs codices give ample depictions of the disease's progression. It was known to them as the \"huey ahuizotl\" (great rash).\n\nCuitlahuac contracted the disease and died after ruling for eighty days. Though the disease also affected the Spanish-aligned forces somewhat, it had more dire consequences for the leadership on the side of the Aztecs, as they were much harder hit by the smallpox than the Spanish leaders, who were largely resistant to the disease.\n\nIt is often debated why the Aztecs took little action against the Spanish and their allies after they fled the city. One reason was that Tenochtitlan was certainly in a state of disorder: the smallpox disease ravaged the population, killing still more important leaders and nobles, and a new king, Cuauhtémoc, son of King Ahuitzotl, was placed on the throne in February 1521. The people were in the process of mourning the dead and rebuilding their damaged city. It is possible that the Aztecs truly believed that the Spanish were gone for good. In addition, Cortés astutely directed his forces in multiple directions in preparing his encirclement of the Aztec capital, and knew how to use the military initiative that he gained after the battle of Otumba.\n\nStaying within Tenochtitlan as a defensive tactic may have seemed like a reliable strategy at the time. This would allow them the largest possible army that would be close to its supplies, while affording them the mobility provided by the surrounding lake. Any Spanish assault would have to come through the causeways, where the Aztecs could easily attack them. As the only Aztec victory against the Spanish was won in the city using their peculiar urban warfare tactics, and as they counted on retaining control over the water, it seems natural that they wanted to risk their main army only to defend their capital. However, it would not be correct to infer that the Aztecs were passive observers of their fate - they did send numerous expeditions to aid their allies against Cortés at every point, with 10 to 20 thousand forces risked in every engagement, such as in Chalco and Chapultepec. They were driven back every time, and some of the native allies won their own victories over the Aztecs, as their dread of their invincible overlords faded with every success of Cortés.\n\nCortés's overall plan was to trap and besiege the Aztecs within their capital. Cortés intended to do that primarily by increasing his power and mobility on the lake, while protecting \"his flanks while they marched up the causeway\", previously one of his main weaknesses. He ordered the construction of thirteen sloops (brigantines) in Tlaxcala, by his master shipbuilder, Martín López. Cortés continued to receive a steady stream of supplies from ships arriving at Vera Cruz, one ship from Spain loaded with \"arms and powder\", and two ships intended for Narváez. Cortés also received one hundred and fifty soldiers and twenty horses from the abandoned Panuco river settlement. A large source of succour for Cortés were the misguided expeditions by Francisco de Garay, the Governor of Jamaica, who kept sending ship after ship to aid his original Panuco venture long after it had been destroyed and abandoned; all of these ships and forces ended up reinforcing Cortés before the siege.\n\nCortés then decided to move his army to Texcoco, where he could assemble and launch the sloops in the creeks flowing into Lake Texcoco. With his main headquarters in Texcoco, he could stop his forces from being spread too thin around the lake, and there he could contact them where they needed. Xicotencatl the Elder provided Cortés with over ten thousand Tlaxcalan warriors under the command of Chichimecatecle. Cortés departed Tlaxcala on the day after Christmas 1520. When his force arrived at the outskirts of Texcoco, he was met by seven chieftains stating their leader Coanacotzin begs \"for your friendship\". Cortés quickly replaced that leader with the son of Nezahualpilli, baptized as Don Hernán Cortés.\n\nAfter winning over Chalco and Tlamanalco, Cortés sent eight Mexican prisoners to Cuauhtemoc stating, \"all the towns in the neighborhood were now on our side, as well as the Tlaxcalans\". Cortés intended to blockade Mexico and then destroy it. Once Martin López and Chichimecatecle brought the logs and planks to Texcoco, the sloops were built quickly. Cuauhtemoc's forces were defeated four times in March 1521, around Chalco and Huaxtepec, and Cortés received another ship load of arms and men from the Emperor.\n\nOn 6 April 1521, Cortés met with the \"caciques\" around Chalco, and announced he would \"bring peace\" and blockade Mexico. He wanted all of their warriors ready the next day when he put thirteen sloops into the lake (misleadingly called \"launches\" in some translations). He was then joined at Chimaluacan by twenty thousand warriors from Chalco, Texcoco, Huejotzingo, and Tlaxcala. Cortés fought a major engagement with seventeen thousand of Cuauhtemoc's warriors at Xochimilco, before continuing his march northwestward. Cortés found Coyoacan, Tacuba, Atzcapotzalco, and Cuauhitlan deserted.\n\nReturning to Texcoco, which had been guarded by his Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval, Cortés was joined by many more men from Castile. Cortés then discovered a plot aimed at his murder, for which he had the main conspirator, Antonio de Villafana, hanged. Thereafter, Cortés had a personal guard of six soldiers, under the command of Antonio de Quiñones. The Spaniards also held their third auctioning of branded slaves, Mexican allies captured by Cortés, \"who had revolted after giving their obedience to His Majesty.\"\n\nCortés had 84 horsemen, 194 arbalesters and arquebusiers, plus 650 Spanish foot soldiers. He stationed 25 men on every sloop, 12 oarsmen, 12 crossbowmen and musketeers, and a captain. Each sloop had rigging, sails, oars, and spare oars. Additionally, Cortés had 20,000 warriors from Tlaxcala, Huexotzinco, and Cholula. The Tlaxcalans were led by Xicotencatl II and Chichimecatecle. Cortés was ready to start the blockade of Mexico after Corpus Christi (feast).\n\nCortés put Alvarado in command of 30 horsemen, 18 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, and sent him, accompanied by his brother Jorge de Alvarado, Gutierrez de Badajoz, and Andrés de Monjaraz, to secure Tacuba. Cristóbal de Olid took 30 horsemen, 20 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 175 foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, accompanied by Andrés de Tapia, Francisco Verdugo, and Francisco de Lugo, and secured Coyohuacan. Gonzalo de Sandoval took 24 horsemen, 14 arquebusiers and arbalesters, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 warriors from Chalco and Huexotzinco, accompanied by Luis Marin and Pedro de Ircio, to secure Ixtlapalapan. Cortés commanded the 13 sloops. Cortés' forces took up these positions on May 22.\n\nThe forces under Alvarado and Olid marched first towards Chapultepec to disconnect the Aztecs from their water supply. There were springs there that supplied much of the city's water by aqueduct; the rest of the city's water was brought in by canoe. The two generals then tried to bring their forces over the causeway at Tlacopan, resulting in the Battle of Tlacopan. The Aztec forces managed to push back the Spanish and halt this assault on the capital with a determined and hard-fought land and naval counterattack.\n\nCortés faced \"more than a thousand canoes\" after he launched his thirteen sloops from Texcoco. Yet a \"favorable breeze sprang up\", enabling him to overturn many canoes and kill or capture many. After winning the First Battle on the Lake, Cortés camped with Olid's forces.\n\nThe Aztec canoe fleets worked well for attacking the Spanish because they allowed the Aztecs to surround the Spanish on both sides of the causeway. Cortés decided to make an opening in the causeway so that his brigantines could help defend his forces from both sides. He then distributed the sloops amongst his attacking forces, four to Alvarado, six for Olid, and two to Sandoval on the Tepeaquilla causeway. After this move, the Aztecs could no longer attack from their canoes on the opposite side of the Spanish brigantines, and \"the fighting went very much in our favour\", according to Díaz.\n\nWith his brigantines, Cortés could also send forces and supplies to areas he previously could not, which put a kink in Cuauhtémoc's plan. To make it more difficult for the Spanish ships to aid the Spanish soldier's advance along the causeways, the Aztecs dug deep pits in shallow areas of the lakes, into which they hoped the Spaniards would stumble, and fixed concealed stakes into the lake bottom to impale the launches. The Spanish horses were also ineffective on the causeways.\n\nCortés was forced to adapt his plans again, as his initial land campaigns were ineffective. He had planned to attack on the causeways during the daytime and retreat to camp at night; however, the Aztecs moved in to occupy the abandoned bridges and barricades as soon as the Spanish forces left. Consequently, Cortés had his forces set up on the causeways at night to defend their positions. Cortés also sent orders to \"never on any account to leave a gap unblocked, and that all the horsemen were to sleep on the causeway with their horses saddled and bridled all night long.\" This allowed the Spanish to progress closer and closer towards the city.\n\nThe Spaniards prevented food and water from reaching Tenochtitlan along the three causeways. They limited the supplies reaching the city from the nine surrounding towns via canoe, by sending out two of their launches on nightly capture missions. However, the Aztecs were successful in setting an ambush with thirty of their pirogues in an area in which they had placed impaling stakes. They captured two Spanish launches, killing Captain de Portilla and Pedro Barba.\n\nAfter capturing two chieftains, Cortés learned of another Aztec plot to ambush his launches with forty pirogues. Cortés then organized a counter-ambush with six of his launches, which was successful, \"killing many warriors and taking many prisoners.\" Afterwards, the Aztec \"did not dare to lay any more ambuscades, or to bring in food and water as openly as before.\" Lakeside towns, including Iztapalapa, Churubusco, Culuacan, and Mixquic made peace with the Spaniards. The fighting in Tenochtitlan was described by the American historian Charles Robinson as \"desperate\" as both sides battled one another in the streets in a ferocious battle where no quarter was given nor asked for.\n\nCuauhtemoc then attacked all three Spanish camps simultaneously with his entire army on the feast day of St. John. On the Tacuba Causeway across Lake Texcoco connecting Tenochtitlan to the mainland along a street now known as \"Puente de Alvarado\" (Alvarado's Bridge) in Mexico City, Pedro de Alvarado made a mad cavalry charge across a gap in the Causeway. As Alvarado and his cavalry emerged on the other side of the gap with the infantry behind, Aztec canoes filled the gap. Pedro de Alvarado was wounded along with eight men in his camp. Alvarado escaped from the ambush, but five of his men were captured and taken off to the Great Temple to be sacrificed. Much to their horror, the Spanish from their positions could see their captured comrades being sacrificed on the Great Pyramid, which increased their hatred of the Aztecs. At the end of each day, the Spanish gave a prayer: \"Oh, thanks be to God that they did not carry me off today to be sacrificed.\"\n\nCortés then decided to push forward a simultaneous attack towards the Mexican market square. However, he neglected to fill in a channel as he advanced, and when the Aztec counter-attacked, Cortés was wounded and almost captured. Cristóbal de Olea and Cristóbal de Guzmán gave their lives for Cortés, and sixty-five Spanish soldiers were captured alive. Cuauhtemoc then had five of their heads thrown at Alvarado's camp, four thrown at Cortés' camp, six thrown at Sandoval's camp, while ten more were sacrificed to the Huitzilopochtli and Texcatlipoca idols.\n\nDíaz relates, \"...the dismal drum of Huichilobos sounded again...we saw our comrades who had been captured in Cortés' defeat being dragged up the steps to be sacrificed...cutting open their chests, drew out their palpitating hearts which they offered to the idols...the Indian butchers...cut off their arms and legs...then they ate their flesh with a sauce of peppers and tomatoes...throwing their trunks and entrails to the lions and tigers and serpents and snakes.\" Cuauhtemoc then \"sent the hands and feet of our soldiers, and the skin of their faces...to all the towns of our allies...\" The Aztec sacrificed a batch of Spanish prisoners each night for ten nights. The Aztec cast off the cooked limbs of their prisoners to the Tlaxcalans, shouting: \"Eat the flesh of these \"teules\" [\"Gods\"-a reference to the early belief that Spanish were gods] and of your brothers because we are sated with it\".\n\nThe Aztec continued to attack the Spaniards on the causeways, \"day and night\". The Spanish allies in the cities surrounding the lake lost many lives or \"went home wounded\", and \"half their canoes were destroyed\". Yet, \"they did not help the Aztec any more, for they loathed them.\" Yet, of the 24,000 allies, only 200 remained in the three Spanish camps, the rest deciding to return home.\nAhuaxpitzactzin (later baptized as Don Carlos), the brother of the Texcoco lord Don Fernando, remained in Cortés' camp with forty relatives and friends. The Huejotzinco Cacique remained in Sandoval's camp with fifty men. Alvarado's camp had Chichimecatecle, the two sons of Lorenzo de Vargas, and eighty Tlaxcalans. To maintain the advance, Cortés razed every neighborhood he captured, using the rubble to fill up canals and gaps in the causeways to allow his infantry and cavalry to advance in formation, a fighting tactic that favored the Spanish instead of engaging in hand to hand street fighting, which favored the Aztec.\n\nCortés then concentrated on letting the Aztec \"eat up all the provisions they have\" and drink brackish water. The Spaniards gradually advanced along the causeways, though without allies. Their launches had freedom of the lake, after devising a method for breaking the impaling stakes the Aztec had placed for them. After twelve days of this, the Spanish allies realized the prophecy by the Aztec idols, that the Spaniards would be dead in ten days was false. Two thousand warriors returned from Texcoco, as did many Tlaxcan warriors under Tepaneca from Topeyanco, and those from Huejotzingo and Cholula.\nCuauhtemoc then enlisted his allies in Matlazingo, Malinalco, and Tulapa, in attacking the Spaniards from the rear. However, Cortés sent Andrés de Tapia, with 20 horsemen and 100 soldiers, and Gonzalo de Sandoval, with 20 horsemen and 80 soldiers, to help his allies attack this new threat. They returned with two of the Matlazingo chieftains as prisoners.\n\nAs the Spanish employed more successful strategies, their stranglehold on Tenochtitlan tightened, and famine began to affect the Aztecs. The Aztecs were cut off from the mainland because of the occupied causeways. Cortés also had the advantage of fighting a mostly defensive battle. Though Cuauhtémoc organized a large-scale attack on Alvarado's forces at Tlacopan, the Aztec forces were pushed back. Throughout the siege, the Aztecs had little aid from outside of Tenochtitlan. The remaining loyal tributaries had difficulty sending forces, because it would leave them vulnerable to Spanish attack. Many of these loyal tributaries were surrounded by the Spanish.\n\nThough the tributaries often went back and forth in their loyalties at any sign of change, the Spanish tried hard not to lose any allies. They feared a \"snowball effect\": if one tributary left, others might follow. Therefore, they brutally crushed any tributaries who tried to send help to Tenochtitlan. Any shipments of food and water were intercepted, and even those trying to fish in the lake were attacked. The situation inside the city was desperate: because of the famine and the smallpox there were already thousands of victims, women offered to the gods even their children's clothes, so most children were stark naked. Many Aztecs drank dirty, brackish water because of their severe thirst and contracted dysentery. The famine was so severe that the Aztecs ate anything, even wood, leather, and bricks for sustenance.\n\nThe Spanish continued to push closer to Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs changed tactics as often as the Spanish did, preventing Cortés's forces from being entirely victorious. However, the Aztecs were severely worn down. They had no new troops, supplies, food, nor water. The Spanish received a large amount of supplies from Vera Cruz, and, somewhat renewed, finally entered the main part of Tenochtitlan.\n\nCortés then ordered a simultaneous advance of all three camps towards the Tlatelolco marketplace. Alvarado's company made it there first, and Gutierrez de Badajoz advanced to the top of the Huichilopotzli \"cu\", setting it afire and planting their Spanish banners. Cortés' and Sandoval's men were able to join them there after four more days of fighting.\n\nThe Spanish forces and their allies advanced into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled Tlatelolco. Cortés sent emissaries to negotiate with the Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for a hundred years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an annual quota of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge. The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: \"Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cortés himself\". In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Cortés wrote: \"We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. Our allies also took many spoils that day, which we were unable to prevent, as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, though we did all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the people began to come out [to surrender] they might prevent our allies from killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable. I also told the captains of our allies that on no account should any of those people be slain; but there were so many that we could not prevent more than fifteen thousand being killed and sacrificed [by the Tlaxcalans] that day\".\n\nThroughout the battles with the Spanish, the Aztecs still practiced the traditional ceremonies and customs. Tlapaltecatl Opochtzin was chosen to be outfitted to wear the quetzal owl costume. He was supplied with darts sacred to Huitzilopochtli, which came with wooden tips and flint tops. When he came, the Spanish soldiers appeared scared and intimidated. They chased the owl-warrior, but he was neither captured nor killed. The Aztecs took this as a good sign, but they could fight no more, and after discussions with the nobles, Cuauhtémoc began talks with the Spanish.\n\nAfter several failed peace overtures to Cuauhtémoc, Cortés ordered Sandoval to attack that part of the city in which Cuauhtémoc had retreated. As hundreds of canoes filled the lake fleeing the doomed city, Cortés sent his brigantines out to intercept them. Cuauhtémoc attempted to flee with his property, gold, jewels, and family in fifty pirogues, but was soon captured by Sandoval's launches, and brought before Cortés.\n\nThe Aztec forces were destroyed and the Aztecs surrendered on 13 August 1521, Julian Date. Cortés demanded the return of the gold lost during La Noche Triste. Under torture, by burning their feet with oil, Cuauhtémoc and the lord of Tacuba confessed to dumping his gold and jewels into the lake. Yet, little gold remained, as earlier, a fifth had been sent to Spain and another kept by Cortés. \"In the end...the remaining gold all fell to the King's officials.\"\n\nCuauhtémoc was taken prisoner the same day, as related above, and remained the titular leader of Tenochtitlan, under the control of Cortés, until he was hanged for treason in 1525 while accompanying a Spanish expedition to Guatemala.\n\n100,000 to 240,000 were killed in the campaign overall including warriors and civilians. As many as 40,000 Aztecs bodies were floating in the canals or awaiting burial after the siege. Almost all of the Aztec nobility were dead, and the remaining survivors were mostly young women and very young children. At least 40,000 Aztecs civilians were killed and captured.\n\nAfter the Fall of Tenochtitlan the remaining Aztec warriors and civilians fled the city as the Spanish allies, primarily the Tlaxcalans, continued to attack even after the surrender, slaughtering thousands of the remaining civilians and looting the city. The Tlaxcalans did not spare women or children: they entered houses, stealing all precious things they found, raping and then killing women, stabbing children. The survivors marched out of the city for the next three days. One source claims 6,000 were massacred in the town of Ixtapalapa alone. Due to the wholesale slaughter after the campaign and the destruction of Aztec culture some sources such as Israel Charney, John C. Cox, and Norman Naimark have likened the siege to a genocide.\n\nAlthough some reports put the number as low as forty, the Spanish lost over 100 soldiers in the siege, while thousands of Tlaxcalans perished. It is estimated that around 1,800 Spaniards died from all causes during the two-year campaign—from Vera Cruz to Tenochtitlan. (Thomas, pp. 528–29) The remaining Spanish forces consisted of 800–900 Spaniards, eighty horses, sixteen pieces of artillery, and Cortés' thirteen brigantines. Other sources estimate that around 860 Spanish soldiers and 20,000 Tlaxcalan warriors were killed during all the battles in this region from 1519–1521.\n\nIt is well accepted that Cortés' indigenous allies, which may have numbered as many as 200,000 over the three-year period of the conquest, were indispensable to his success.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890753", "title": "Wink murder", "text": "Wink murder\n\nWink murder is a party game or parlour game in which a secretly selected player is able to \"kill\" others by winking at them, while the surviving players try to identify the killer. The game is also variously known as Murder Wink, Killer, Murder in the Dark, Lonely Ghost and Killer Killer. The practical minimum number of players is four, but the spirit of the game is best captured by groups of at least six players or more.\n\nIn each round of play, one player is secretly assigned the role of \"murderer\", perhaps by handing every player a playing card with a particular card signifying that the recipient is the murderer. The murderer has the ability to \"kill\" other players by making eye contact and winking at them. If a player is winked at, they must count silently to five before feigning sudden death, and either lying on the floor where they died, or silently leaving the playing area.\n\nIf a player suspects they know the identity of the murderer, they may raise their hand and announce \"I accuse\", without naming their suspect. At this point, the game pauses and the accuser asks for somebody to second their accusation, again with neither naming a suspect. When they have a seconder, both of these players simultaneously point to their suspect; if they are both pointing to a player who admits to being the murderer, the game ends. Otherwise (if they are pointing to different players, or to an innocent player) the accusers are both eliminated as if they had been murdered. Players are forbidden from communicating their thoughts on who the murderer might be, and players who are not the murderer are not allowed to wink.\n\nThe objective of the murderer is to murder as many people as possible without being caught.\n\nIn one variant of the game, sometimes played by children as a class activity in primary school, another player, unaware of the murderer's identity, is assigned the role of \"detective\". All other players sit in a circle around the detective, whose objective is to correctly identify and accuse the murderer, minimising the number of murder victims. A limit is often imposed upon the number of accusations the detective can make. In this version of the game, players other than the murderer and detective do not know the murderer's identity, and have no role to play in the game other than to die noticeably if winked at.\n\nHarpo Marx in his book \"Harpo Speaks\" described a version of this game at the home of Alexander Woollcott, called \"Murder\". Lots are drawn to choose a District Attorney, then drawn a second time to choose (known only to him- or herself) a Murderer. The D.A. leaves the house and the social evening proceeds as normal. As soon as the Murderer is alone with someone, he says to that person \"You are dead\". The victim must immediately feign death until discovered, then the D.A. is summoned and questions the suspects (everyone) as to where they were, what they were doing, and with whom. The D.A. then uses deductive reasoning to solve the case. Marx said he played the Murderer once, and wrote the deadly phrase on a piece of toilet paper. His victim, Alice Duer Miller, pulled it down and properly \"died\" on the toilet, but grade-school dropout Marx was immediately identified when she was found; he had written \"You are ded\".\n\nThe \"Deadly Handshake\" variation has players walking around and routinely shaking hands as though greeting one another at a party, and the murderer kills by using a special handshake, such as tickling the victim's palm. It is recommended that victims do not \"die\" immediately, but take a few steps or shake hands with one or two other people before doing so.\n\nIn \"Lonely Ghost\", a player may challenge the murderer (the \"Lonely Ghost\") by approaching them and asking them directly. In another variant of the basic game, a player may simply point to their suspect and call out their accusation. If the accuser is correct, they win the game, otherwise they are eliminated. In some variants, a wrongly accused player is also eliminated.\n\n\"Cops and Robbers\" is a drinking game variation of Wink murder. It uses the Ace and King to identify the \"Cop\" and the \"Robber.\" How a cop or a robber relates is not known. The game starts by using the same number of playing cards as players, including one Ace and one King. The rest of the cards are usually number cards which represent the number of seconds to drink. Play begins by shuffling the cards and laying them all face down. Each player grabs a card and keeps it to themselves. The player with the Ace is the player who winks to one other player. The player who got winked then says something like \"The deal has been made.\" Usually this player waits a few seconds before making that statement. Once \"the deal has been made\" the player with the King turns over their card and begins the \"interrogation.\" This player tries to guess who did the winking. As they choose a player, they turn over their card and if they did not have the Ace, the other player drinks the number on the card. If they correctly chose the player with the Ace, that player must finish their beverage. If the player with the Ace winks at the player with the King, an immediate \"social\" is called and everyone drinks. Because no one knows who will choose the Ace or King, all players are involved in either winking or looking for a wink. This can also be played with other drinking games like \"drink, drank or drunk\" to expedite the festivities.\n\nThe \"Slit Throat\" variation has players walking around in the Dark, wandering the halls and rooms of a building. Identities are given out at the beginning with Ace of Spades as Murderer (depending on number of players, there can be multiple Murderers), Kings are Detectives (at least double the number of Murderers), all other cards are towns people (Town Mob). As people wander the halls, the Murderer kills people in the Dark by slitting their throat with a finger and tells them where to lay down and die, the Murderer then walks away from the victim as they precede to lie down. The Murderer may steal the Identity Card of the victims. All dead people must remain silent and can only answer YES if asked if they are dead. When somebody discovers a dead person they quickly move to turn on the nearest light and yell \"Murder in the Dark\". Then everybody comes to the room for a town meeting, including all people killed that round. A Detective may reveal him/herself to lead the meeting by showing off their badge (King Identity Card). During the meeting the towns people tell the Detective what they saw and who they suspect. The Detective may then decide to accuse a player of being the Murderer or close the meeting and continue the game if they are not ready to do so. If a Detective accuses wrongly, (s)he is killed by the town mob and the next round begins. The town mob may also accuse by majority vote, but kill the accused when innocent. After a wrong accusation the game automatically goes on to the next round. The lights are turned off and people resume wandering through the building. During the town meetings the Murderer may lie as much as they want to fool the Detective and/or Town Mob. Only when properly accused the Murderer must admit to guilt and the game is over and (s)he loses. If the Murderer successfully kills off everybody, (s)he turns on the light and declares him/herself the winner and the game is over.\n\n"}

It is located in the Port Lands area of the Toronto waterfront at 470 Unwin Avenue, adjacent to the site of the decommissioned Hearn Generating Station.\n\nThe Portlands Energy Centre is owned and operated as a 50/50 joint partnership between Ontario Power Generation and TransCanada Corporation (now TC Energy).\n\nThe technical specifications of the plant in the original submission of the environmental review report (a less rigorous form of a full environmental assessment) to the Ministry of the Environment in November 2003 have been significantly altered. This was due to the government instructing Ontario Power Generation to stop participating in projects which use more environmentally acceptable generations systems, such as co-generation. Originally, the plant was described as two identical 275 MW power train systems, each comprising a 175 MW GE 7FA gas turbine generator, and other equipment. This proposed configuration was capable of producing over 272,000 kilograms per hour of steam for district heating. This design would, according to a PEC newsletter, allow for the efficiency of the plant to be “about 55% compared to 35% for a typical fossil power plant” There were also plans to include “Canada’s largest solar array” capable of producing “hundreds of kilowatts” though no actual specification seems to have ever been given.\n\nThe original design met with some community resistance and many local residents, all local politicians and a number of significant City of Toronto departments including the Works Department and the Board of Health. These groups called for a full Environmental Assessment (EA) as a way to resolve some of the technical and health related issues with the plant. The Ontario Liberal Government denied a full EA. Over time, the plan was altered significantly in a way that reduced the efficiency and aesthetic virtues of the plant. In November 2004, the proponents hosted a meeting to tell the community that the generation of steam for district heating was no longer going to happen and that the solar panels were no longer going to be included. It was also noted that the attempts to make the exterior of the plant aesthetically pleasing had been dropped in favour of a shed type design.\n\nThe plant was met with considerable local opposition, since it was to be sited on the Waterfront, which is currently undergoing a revitalization process, and has been striving to be a “world leader in sustainable design” (according to the Corporation Chair, Robert Fung). The Ontario Liberal Government decided that, despite significant opposition, the project would be allowed to move forward without a full Environmental Assessment. The Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation played a more neutral role, offering criticism of the plant but falling short of calling for a change of plans.\n\nOn September 18, 2006, TransCanada issued a press release announcing that Portlands Energy Centre L.P. had signed a 20-year Accelerated Clean Energy Supply (ACES) contract with the Ontario Power Authority for the power output of the PEC.\n\nThe plant started delivering 340 MW of power to the City of Toronto in June 2008 in single-cycle operation and was fully operational with an output of 550 MW by the second-quarter 2009. Total capital costs are expected to reach $730MM.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890776", "title": "Enamelin", "text": "Enamelin\n\nEnamelin is an enamel matrix protein (EMPs), that in humans is encoded by the \"ENAM\" gene. It is part of the non-amelogenins, which comprise 10% of the total enamel matrix proteins. It is one of the key proteins thought to be involved in amelogenesis (enamel development). The formation of enamel's intricate architecture is thought to be rigorously controlled in ameloblasts through interactions of various organic matrix protein molecules that include: enamelin, amelogenin, ameloblastin, tuftelin, dentine sialophosphoprotein, and a variety of enzymes. Enamelin is the largest protein (~168kDa) in the enamel matrix of developing teeth and is the least abundant (encompasses approximately 1-5%) of total enamel matrix proteins. It is present predominantly at the growing enamel surface.\n\nEnamelin is thought to be the oldest member of the enamel matrix protein (EMP) family, with animal studies showing remarkable conservation of the gene phylogenetically. All other EMPs are derived from enamelin, such as amelogenin. EMPs belong to a larger family of proteins termed 'secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins' (SCPP).\n\nSimilar to other enamel matrix proteins, enamelin undergoes extensive post-translational modifications (mainly phosphorylation), processing, and secretion by proteases. Enamelin has three putative phosphoserines (Ser, Ser, and Ser in humans) phosphorylated by a Golgi-associated secretory pathway kinase (FAM20C) based on their distinctive Ser-x-Glu (S-x-E) motifs. The major secretory product of the ENAM gene has 1103 amino acids (post-secretion), and has an acidic isoelectric point ranging from 4.5–6.5 (depending on the fragment).\n\nAt the secretory stage, the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-20 (MMP20) proteolytically cleaves the secreted enamelin protein immediately upon release, into several smaller polypeptides; each having their own functions. However, the whole protein (~168 kDa) and its largest derivative fragment (~89 kDa) are undetectable in the secretory stage; these are existent only at the mineralisation front. Smaller polypeptide fragments remain embedded in the enamel, throughout the secretory stage enamel matrix. These strongly bind to the mineral and retard seeded crystal growth.\n\nThe primary function of the proteins acts at the mineralisation front; growth sites where it is the interface between the ameloblast plasma membrane and lengthening extremity of crystals. The key activities of enamelin can be summarised:\n\n\nIt is speculated that this protein could interact with amelogenin or other enamel matrix proteins and be important in determining growth of the length of enamel crystallites. The mechanism of this proposed co-interaction is synergistic (\"Goldilocks effect\"). With enamelin enhancing the rates of crystal nucleation via the creation of addition sites for EMPs, such as amelogenin, to template calcium phosphate nucleation.\n\nIt is best thought to understand the overarching function of enamelin as the proteins responsible for correct enamel thickness formation.\n\nMutations in the \"ENAM\" gene can cause certain subtypes of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a heterogenous group of heritable conditions in which enamel in malformed. Point mutations can cause autosomal-dominant hypoplastic AI, and novel \"ENAM\" mutations can cause autosomal-recessive hypoplastic AI. However, mutations in the \"ENAM\" gene mainly tend to lead to the autosomal-dominant AI. The phenotype of the mutations are generalised thin enamel and no defined enamel layer.\n\nA moderately higher than usual \"ENAM\" expression leads to protrusive structures (often, horizontal grooves) on the surface of enamel, and with high transgene expression, the enamel layer is almost lost.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1890794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890794", "title": "Parliament of Singapore", "text": "Parliament of Singapore\n\nThe Parliament of the Republic of Singapore and the President jointly make up the legislature of Singapore, which is based on the Westminster system. Parliament is unicameral and is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) who are elected, as well as Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) who are appointed. Following the 2015 general election, 89 MPs and three NCMPs were elected to the 13th Parliament. Nine NMPs were appointed during the first session of this Parliament. The first sitting of the 13th Parliament took place on 15 January 2016.\n\nBetween 1819, when modern Singapore was founded, and 1867, the lawmaking authorities were the British government in India and the Parliament of the United Kingdom. After the Straits Settlements (Malacca, Penang, and Singapore) became a Crown colony, this function was taken over by the Settlements' Legislative Council, which was an unelected body. Following World War II the Straits Settlements were dissolved and Singapore became a colony in its own right with its own Legislative Council. In 1948 the Constitution was amended to allow for six seats in the council to be elected; the country's first democratic elections were held that year. A further amendment in 1955 increased the number of elected seats to 25, and in the general elections that followed, the Labour Front won the majority of the seats in the Legislative Assembly of Singapore and its leader, David Saul Marshall, became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. Self-government was negotiated with the Colonial Office in London in 1956–1957, and became a reality in 1959. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power, and its leader Lee Kuan Yew was appointed Prime Minister of Singapore. Singapore gained independence from Britain by joining Malaysia in 1963, but became a fully independent republic on 9 August 1965. Its Legislative Assembly was renamed the Parliament of Singapore.\n\nThe Speaker of Parliament has overall charge of the administration of Parliament and its secretariat, and presides over parliamentary sittings. The Leader of the House is an MP appointed by the Prime Minister to arrange government business and the legislative programme of Parliament, while the unofficial Leader of the Opposition is the MP who leads the largest opposition party able and prepared to assume office if the Government resigns. However, in September 2011, Low Thia Khiang, the secretary-general of the Workers' Party of Singapore, which holds the most opposition seats in Parliament, said that he would not be accepting the title. Some of Parliament's work is carried out by select committees made up of small numbers of MPs. Standing select committees are permanently constituted to fulfil certain duties, and \"ad hoc\" select committees are established from time to time to deal with matters such studying the details of bills. In addition, selected PAP backbenchers sit on Government Parliamentary Committees that examine the policies, programmes and proposed legislation of government ministries.\n\nThe main functions of Parliament are lawmaking, controlling the nation's finances, and ensuring ministerial accountability. Parliament convenes when it is in session. The first session of a particular Parliament commences when Parliament meets after being formed following a general election. A session ends when Parliament is prorogued (temporarily suspended) or dissolved. The maximum term of each Parliament is five years, after which Parliament automatically dissolves. A general election must then be held within three months.\n\nThe quorum for a Parliamentary sitting is one quarter of the total number of MPs, not including the Speaker. An MP begins a debate by moving a motion and delivering an opening speech explaining the reasons for the motion. The Speaker (or chairman, if Parliament is in committee) then puts the motion in the form of a question, following which other MPs may debate the motion. After that, the mover may exercise a right of reply. When the debate is closed, the Speaker puts the question on the motion to the House and calls for a vote. Voting is generally done verbally, and whether the motion is carried depends on the Speaker's personal assessment of whether more MPs have voted for than against the motion. MPs' votes are only formally counted if an MP claims a division.\n\nParliament regulates its own privileges, immunities and powers. For instance, the freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament may not be impeached or questioned in any court or other place out of Parliament. Parliament may punish an MP for acting dishonourably, abusing a privilege or behaving contemptuously.\n\nParliament convened at the Old Parliament House between 1955 and 1999, before moving into a newly constructed Parliament House on 6 September 1999.\n\nThe term \"Parliament\" is used in a number of different senses. First, it refers to the institution made up of a group of people (Members of Parliament or MPs) who are elected to discuss matters of state. Secondly, it can mean each group of MPs voted into office following a general election. In this sense, the First Parliament of the independent Republic of Singapore sat from 8 December 1965 to 8 February 1968. The current Parliament, which started on 15 January 2016, is the thirteenth.\n\n\"Parliament\" is sometimes used loosely to refer to Parliament House, which is the seat of the Parliament of Singapore.\n\nOn 6 February 1819, Sultan Hussein Shah and the Temenggung of Johor, Abdul Rahman Sri Maharajah, entered into an agreement with Sir Stamford Raffles for the British East India Company (EIC) to establish a \"factory\" or trading post on the island of Singapore. Raffles, who was Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen (now Bengkulu, Indonesia), placed Singapore under Bencoolen's jurisdiction. As Bencoolen was itself a factory subordinate to the Bengal Presidency in British India, only the Governor-General in Council in Bengal was authorized to enact laws for Singapore. On 24 June 1824 Singapore was removed from Bencoolen's control and, together with Malacca, formally transferred to the EIC. This made them subordinate to Fort William in Calcutta (now Kolkata), the capital of the Bengal Presidency. By a treaty of 19 November 1824, the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor ceded Singapore to the EIC. In 1826, the company constituted Malacca, Prince of Wales Island (now Penang) and Singapore into the Presidency of the Straits Settlements with Penang as the capital. The general power to make laws for the Straits Settlements remained with the Supreme Government in India and the Parliament of the United Kingdom; Penang's legislative power was limited to making rules and regulations relating to duties and taxes that the Settlement was empowered to levy.\n\nOn 20 June 1830, as a cost-cutting measure, the Straits Settlements ceased to be a separate presidency and were placed under the Bengal Presidency's control by the EIC. In 1833, the Government of India Act passed by the British Parliament created a local government for the whole of India made up of the Governor-General and his counsellors. They were collectively known as the Governor-General of India in Council and had the sole power to pass laws for the Straits Settlements. However, India's slow response to problems in the Settlements such as the ineffective court system and the lack of Straits representation in the Indian legislative council prompted merchants and other prominent people to call for the Settlements to be governed directly by the Colonial Office in the United Kingdom. Finally, on 1 April 1867 the Straits Settlements were separated from the Government of India and became a Crown colony.\n\nUnder letters patent dated 4 February 1867, the Straits Settlements were granted a colonial constitution in the usual form. The Governor of the Straits Settlements ruled with the help of an executive council and a legislative council. The executive council was made up of the governor, the commanding officer of the troops in the Straits, and six senior officials (including the colonial secretary, lieutenant-governor of Penang, attorney-general and colonial engineer). The legislative council, in which legislative authority was vested, consisted of the executive council and the chief justice (together known as the official members) and four unofficial members nominated by the governor. As the unofficial members were outnumbered by the official members, they and the governor (who had a casting vote) had effective control of the council. Legislation was generally initiated by the Governor, and he had the power to assent to or veto bills. During legislative debates, official members were required to support the governor, but the unofficials could speak and vote as they wished. In 1924, the system was changed such that two unofficial members of the legislative council were nominated by the governor to sit on the Executive Council. In addition, the number of members of the legislative council was increased to 26, with equal numbers of officials and unofficials. The governor retained his casting vote. The Penang and European chambers of commerce each nominated one unofficial, while the governor nominated the others on an ethnic basis: five Europeans, including one each from Penang and Malacca, three Chinese British subjects, one Malay, one Indian and one Eurasian. This system remained in place until Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore became a Crown colony in its own right. The reconstituted Legislative Council consisted of four \"ex officio\" members from the Executive Council, seven official members, between two and four unofficial members, and nine elected members. The Governor continued to hold a veto and certain reserved powers over legislation. As there was a majority of official members in the council, the constitution was criticized for not allowing locals to play an effective role in public affairs. Governor Franklin Charles Gimson therefore formed a Reconstitution Committee that proposed, among other things, recommended that the council should be made up of four \"ex officio\" members; five officials; four nominated unofficials; three representatives nominated by the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce to represent European, Chinese and Indian economic interests; and six members to be elected by universal suffrage. For the first time, non-officials held a majority in the legislature. A new constitution embodying these arrangements came into force on 1 March 1948 and Singapore's first democratic elections were held on 20 March that year. Three out of the six elected seats were won by the Progressive Party.\n\nIn 1951 three more elected seats were created in the council. In February 1954, the Rendel Constitutional Commission under the chairmanship of Sir George William Rendel, which had been appointed to comprehensively review the constitution of the Colony of Singapore, rendered its report. Among other things, it recommended that the Legislative Council be transformed into a legislative assembly of 32 members made up of three \"ex officio\" official members holding ministerial posts, four nominated unofficial members, and 25 elected unofficial members. In addition, a Council of Ministers would be created, composed of the three \"ex officio\" members and six elected members appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House, who would be the leader of the largest political party or coalition of parties having majority support in the legislature. The recommendation was implemented in 1955. In the general election held that year, the Labour Front took a majority of the seats in the Assembly, and David Saul Marshall became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. Major problems with the Rendel Constitution were that the Chief Minister and Ministers' powers were ill-defined, and that the official members retained control of the finance, administration, and internal security and law portfolios. This led to confrontation between Marshall, who saw himself as a Prime Minister governing the country, and the Governor, Sir John Fearns Nicoll, who felt that important decisions and policies should remain with himself and the officials.\n\nIn 1956, members of the Legislative Assembly held constitutional talks with the Colonial Office in London. The talks broke down as Marshall did not agree to the British Government's proposal for the casting vote on a proposed Defence Council to be held by the British High Commissioner to Singapore, who would only exercise it in an emergency. Marshall resigned as Chief Minister in June 1956, and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock. The following year, Lim led another delegation to the UK for further talks on self-government. This time, agreement was reached on the composition of an Internal Security Council. Other constitutional arrangements were swiftly settled in 1958, and on 1 August the United Kingdom Parliament passed the State of Singapore Act 1958, granting the colony full internal self-government. Under Singapore's new constitution, which came into force on 3 June 1959, the Legislative Assembly consisted of 51 elected members and the Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State), who had power to appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Legislative Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore.\n\nIn 1963, Singapore gained independence from Britain through merger with Malaysia. In the federal legislature, Singapore was allocated 15 out of 127 seats. Under its new State Constitution, Singapore kept its own executive government and legislative assembly. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left Malaysia and became a fully independent republic. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its legislative powers, and the Parliament of Malaysia gave up all power to make laws for Singapore. Similarly, the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965, passed on 22 December 1965 and made retrospective to 9 August, declared that the legislative powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (Supreme Head of the Federation) and Parliament of Malaysia ceased and vested in the president and the Parliament of Singapore respectively.\n\nThe Parliament of Singapore is unicameral – all Members of Parliament (MPs) make up a single chamber, and there is no senate or upper house. At present, the effect of the Constitution of Singapore and other legislation is that there can be a maximum of 99 MPs. Eighty-seven are elected by the people while up to nine Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and up to nine Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) may be appointed, following changes to the Constitution enacted on 26 April 2010. After the 2011 general election, 87 MPs were elected and three NCMPs were appointed (or, in the terms of the Parliamentary Elections Act, declared elected) to Parliament.\n\nAs of 24 February 2011, for the purpose of Parliamentary elections, Singapore was divided into 27 electoral divisions (also known as constituencies). The names and boundaries of the divisions are specified by the Prime Minister by notification in the \"Government Gazette\". Twelve of these divisions are Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and 15 are Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). GRCs were introduced in 1991 for the purpose of ensuring representation of the Malay, Indian and other minority communities in Parliament. In a GRC, all the candidates must either be members of the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of the candidates must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. The president, at Cabinet's direction, declares the electoral divisions that are to be GRCs; the number of candidates (not less than three but not more than six) to stand for Parliament in each GRC; and whether the minority candidates in each GRC are to be from the Malay, Indian, or other minority communities. At all times there must be at least eight divisions that are not GRCs, and the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) to be returned by all GRCs cannot be less than a quarter of the total number of MPs to be returned at a general election.\n\nEach electoral division returns one MP, or if it is a GRC the number of MPs designated for the constituency by the president, to serve in Parliament. All GRCs currently have between four and six MPs. In other words, a successful voter's single vote in an SMC sends to Parliament one MP, and in a GRC sends either four, five or six MPs depending on how many have been designated for that GRC. At present, SMCs return to Parliament 12 MPs and GRCs 75 MPs. All elected MPs are selected on a simple plurality voting (\"first past the post\") basis. A person is not permitted to be an MP for more than one constituency at the same time.\n\nIn the last general election in 2011, the incumbent People's Action Party (PAP) won 81 of the 87 seats, but lost Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC to the Workers' Party of Singapore (WP). This was the first time a GRC had been won by an opposition party. With the Workers' Party ending up with six elected seats in Parliament, this was the best opposition parliamentary result since independence. Out of the current 87 elected MPs, 19 (about 16.5%) are female. This was a slight fall from the figure of about 20% for the 11th Parliament, in which 17 of the 84 elected MPs were women.\nFollowing the resignation of the Speaker of Parliament Michael Palmer, a by-election for the Punggol East Single Member Constituency was held on 26 January 2013. The seat was won by Lee Li Lian of the Workers' Party, bringing the number of elected WP seats in Parliament to seven and reducing the number of PAP seats to 80.\n\nNon-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) were introduced in 1984 to ensure the representation in Parliament of a minimum number of MPs from a political party or parties not forming the Government. With effect from 1 July 2010, the Constitution provides that the number of NCMPs in Parliament is nine less the number of opposition MPs elected. Following the 2011 general election, since six opposition MPs were elected to Parliament, the law provided for up to three NCMPs to be declared elected. The seats were taken by Lina Chiam of the Singapore People's Party, and Gerald Giam and Yee Jenn Jong of the Workers' Party.\n\nTo be eligible to become an NCMP, a candidate must have polled not less than 15% of the total number of valid votes in the electoral division contested by him or her. The unelected opposition candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes is entitled to be declared the first NCMP, followed by other opposition candidates in descending order according to the percentages of votes polled by them. If any candidates have an equal percentage of votes and the number of such candidates exceeds the number of NCMPs to be declared elected, the NCMPs are determined as follows:\n\n\nIn 1990, the Constitution was amended to provide for the appointment of up to nine Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) to Parliament. The change was prompted by the impression that the existing two Opposition MPs had not adequately expressed significant alternative views held outside Parliament, and that the scheme would allow the Government to take advantage of the expertise of Singaporeans who were not able or prepared to take part in elections and look after constituencies.\n\nFormerly, within six months after Parliament first met after any general election, it had to decide whether there would be any NMPs during the term of that Parliament. With effect from 1 July 2010, such a decision became unnecessary as NMPs were made a permanent feature in Parliament. A special select committee of Parliament chaired by the Speaker of Parliament is established, and invites the general public to submit names of persons who may be considered for nomination by the Committee. From these names, the special select committee then nominates not more than nine persons for appointment by the president as NMPs. The persons to be nominated must have rendered distinguished public service, or have brought honour to Singapore, or have distinguished themselves in the field of arts and letters, culture, the sciences, business, industry, the professions, social or community service or the labour movement; and in making any nomination, the special select committee must have regard to the need for NMPs to reflect as wide a range of independent and non-partisan views as possible. Subject to rules on the tenure of MPs in general, NMPs serve for a term of two and a half years. The first two NMPs sworn in on 20 December 1990 were cardiologist Professor Maurice Choo and company executive Leong Chee Whye. On 6 July 2009, the special select committee announced that it had submitted the names of nine individuals to the President for appointment as new NMPs.\n\nNCMPs and NMPs can participate in all Parliamentary debates, but cannot vote on any motion relating to:\n\n\nPersons are qualified to be elected or appointed as Members of Parliament if:\n\nArticle 45 provides that persons are not qualified to be MPs if:\n\nA person's disqualification for having failed to properly lodge a return of election expenses or having been convicted of an offence may be removed by the president. If the president has not done so, the disqualification ceases at the end of five years from the date when the return was required to be lodged or, as the case may be, the date when the person convicted was released from custody or the date when the fine was imposed. In addition, a person is not disqualified for acquiring or exercising rights of foreign citizenship or declared allegiance to a foreign country if he or she did so before becoming a Singapore citizen.\n\nIf an MP becomes subject to any disqualification specified in paragraph 1, 2, 5 or 7 above and it is open to the Member to appeal against the decision, the Member immediately ceases to be entitled to sit or vote in Parliament or any committee of it. However, he or she is not required to vacate his or her seat until the end of 180 days beginning with the date of the adjudication, declaration or conviction, as the case may be. After that period, the MP must vacate his or her seat if he or she continues to be subject to one of the previously mentioned disqualifications. Otherwise, the MP is entitled to resume sitting or voting in Parliament immediately after ceasing to be disqualified.\n\nThe above rules do not operate to extend the term of service of an NMP beyond two and a half years.\n\nMPs also cease to hold office when Parliament is dissolved, or before that if their seats become vacant for one of the following reasons:\n\nOn 14 February 2012, Yaw Shin Leong, MP for Hougang Single Member Constituency, was expelled from the Workers' Party for refusing to explain allegations of marital infidelity against him. After he notified the Clerk of Parliament that he did not intend to challenge his ouster, the Speaker stated that his Parliamentary seat had been vacated with effect from the date of expulsion, and that a formal announcement would be made in Parliament on the matter on 28 February.\n\nNMPs must vacate their Parliamentary seats if they stand as candidates for any political party in an election or if they are elected as MPs for any constituencies. A person whose seat in Parliament has become vacant may, if qualified, again be elected or appointed as a Member of Parliament from time to time. Any person who sits or votes in Parliament, knowing or having reasonable ground for knowing they are not entitled to do so, is liable to a penalty not exceeding $200 for each day that they sit or vote.\n\nAny question whether any MP has vacated his or her seat, or, in the case of a person elected as Speaker or Deputy Speaker from among non-MPs, he or she ceases to be a citizen of Singapore or becomes subject to any of the disqualifications specified in Article 45, is to be determined by Parliament, the decision of which on the matter is final.\n\nThis does not mean that an MP retains his or her Parliamentary seat despite being under some disqualification until Parliament has made a formal decision on the matter. On 10 November 1986, the MP for Anson, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore, lost an appeal against a conviction for making a false statement in a declaration and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and a fine of $5,000. Further applications and appeals in the criminal proceedings to the High Court, Court of Appeal and the Privy Council (then Singapore's highest court) were dismissed. On 9 December, the Speaker of Parliament made a statement in the House that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP with effect from 10 November by virtue of having been convicted of an offence and sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000. Jeyaretnam did not object to the statement at the time. Under Article 45(2) of the Constitution, he was disqualified to be an MP until five years had elapsed from the date the fine was imposed. Jeyaretnam subsequently applied to court for a declaration that, among other things, he had not ceased to be an MP in 1986 and that the Speaker's statement had been ineffective because Parliament itself had not determined that he had vacated his seat. On 9 July 1990, the High Court ruled that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP by operation of law and that no separate determination by Parliament had been necessary.\n\nMPs receive a monthly allowance, a non-pensionable annual allowance (commonly known as the 13th month pay), and an annual variable component that is paid in July and December each year. The monthly allowance is 56% of the salary of an Administrative Service officer at the SR9 grade – the entry grade for Singapore's top civil servants – which is itself benchmarked at the salary of the 15th person aged 32 years from six professions: banking, law, engineering, accountancy, multinational companies and local manufacturers. In 1995, the monthly allowance was S$8,375 ($100,500 per year). The allowance was revised in 2000 to $11,900 ($142,800 per year).\n\nIn 2007, it was announced that civil service salaries had lagged behind those in the private sector and required revision. MPs' salaries were therefore increased in phases. In 2007, the monthly allowance was revised to $13,200, raising the annual sum to $158,400. A gross domestic product (GDP) bonus payable to civil servants was also extended to MPs to link their annual remuneration to the state of the economy. They would receive no bonus if GDP growth was 2% or less, one month's bonus if the GDP grew at 5%, and up to two months' bonus if the GDP growth reached or exceeded 8%. MPs' allowances to engage legislative and secretarial assistants were also increased from $1,000 to $1,300 and from $350 to $500 respectively. With effect from January 2008, each MP received another increase of his or her allowance package to $13,710 a month, bringing it to $225,000 per year. Subsequently, in 2012, MP's allowances were reduced to $192,500 per annum.\n\nPersons who have reached the age of 50 years and retired as MPs and who have served in this capacity for not less than nine years may be granted a pension for the rest of their lives. The annual amount payable is of the person's highest annual salary for every completed year of service and for every uncompleted year, up to a ceiling of two-thirds of the Member's annual salary. No person has an absolute right to compensation for past services or to any pension or gratuity, and the president may reduce or withhold pensions and gratuities upon an MP's conviction for corruption.\n\nThe Speaker has overall charge of the administration of Parliament and its secretariat. His or her official role is to preside over parliamentary sittings, moderating debates and making decisions based on the Standing Orders of Parliament for the proper conduct of parliamentary business. The Speaker does not participate in debates, but can abstain or vote for or against a motion if he or she is entitled to do so by virtue of being an MP. The Speaker also acts as the representative of Parliament in its external relations, welcoming visiting dignitaries and representing Parliament at national events and overseas visits.\n\nThe Speaker must be elected when Parliament first meets after any general election, before it proceeds to deal with any other business. Similarly, whenever the office of Speaker is vacant for some reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, no business must be transacted other than the election of a person to fill that office. The Speaker may be elected from among the MPs who are not Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries, but even a person who is not an MP can be chosen. Nonetheless, a candidate who is not an MP must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP. The Speaker's salary may not be reduced while he is in office.\n\nThe Speaker may at any time resign his or her office by writing to the Clerk of Parliament. The Speaker must vacate his or her office\n\nParliament shall from time to time elect two Deputy Speakers. Whenever the office of a Deputy Speaker is vacant for a reason other than a dissolution of Parliament, Parliament shall, as soon as is convenient, elect another person to that office. As with the Speaker, a Deputy Speaker may be elected either from among the MPs who are neither Ministers nor Parliamentary Secretaries or from among persons who are not MPs, but those in the latter category must have the qualifications to be elected an MP. Deputy Speakers may resign their office in the same way as the Speaker, and must vacate their office in the same circumstances.\n\nIf there is no one holding the office of Speaker, or if the Speaker is absent from a sitting of Parliament or is otherwise unable to perform the functions conferred by the Constitution, these functions may be performed by a Deputy Speaker. If there is no Deputy Speaker or he or she is likewise absent or unable to perform the functions, they may be carried out by some other person elected by Parliament for the purpose.\n\nMichael Palmer was elected Speaker of the 12th Parliament on 10 October 2011 as the eighth Speaker in the history of the Singapore Parliament since it started in 1955 as a Legislative Assembly. On 17 October 2011, two Deputy Speakers were appointed: Charles Chong and Seah Kian Peng. Palmer resigned as Speaker and as an MP and member of the PAP on 12 December 2012 after admitting he had had an extramarital affair. Halimah Yacob was elected in his place on 14 January 2013, becoming Singapore's first female Speaker. On 7 August 2017, Halimah resigned as Speaker, MP and member of the PAP to stand as a candidate for the 2017 presidential election, and won uncontested on the nomination day held 13 September 2017. In her place, Tan Chuan-Jin, the Minister for Social and Family Development was appointed as Speaker with effect from 11 September 2017.\n\nThe Leader of the House is an MP appointed by the Prime Minister to arrange government business and the legislative programme of Parliament. He or she initiates motions concerning the business of the House during sittings, such as actions to be taken on procedural matters and extending sitting times.\n\nThe current Leader of the House is Grace Fu who has assumed this office on 1 October 2015. She is assisted by Deputy Leader Desmond Lee.\n\n\nIn parliamentary systems of government on the Westminster model, the Leader of the Opposition is the MP who is the leader of the largest opposition party able and prepared to assume office if the Government resigns. This political party often forms a Shadow Cabinet, the members of which serve as opposition spokespersons on key areas of government. Singapore law does not provide for an official Leader of the Opposition, though the leader of the largest opposition party in Parliament is usually given the title of unofficial Leader of the Opposition. This is taken into consideration by the Speaker when seats in Parliament are allocated, and during a debate the MP so designated is often given the privilege of being one of the first non-Government MPs to speak.\n\nSingapore presently does not have a shadow cabinet in Parliament as the People's Action Party (PAP) has held an overwhelming majority of the seats in the House since it came to power in 1959. However, at the 1991 general election four opposition politicians were elected to Parliament: Chiam See Tong, Cheo Chai Chen and Ling How Doong from the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), and Low Thia Khiang from the Workers' Party of Singapore (WP). On 6 January 1992 during a Parliamentary debate on the election of the Speaker of Parliament, the Leader of the House Wong Kan Seng said that he proposed to treat Chiam, then the SDP's secretary-general, as the \"unofficial Leader of the Opposition\" and that the House should give him \"due courtesy and precedence among Opposition MPs\". He likened the situation to that in the Legislative Assembly of Singapore in 1955 when the PAP won three out of four contested seats, and Lee Kuan Yew was \"de facto\" Leader of the Opposition. After Chiam was replaced by Ling as secretary-general of the SDP in 1993, the latter was referred to as the unofficial Leader of the Opposition.\n\nIn the 2006 general election, Chiam and Low retained their seats, and Sylvia Lim from the WP was appointed an NCMP. The prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, referred to Low, who is the WP's secretary-general, as Leader of the Opposition during a debate in the House on 13 November 2006. However, following the 2011 general election, Low announced he would not be accepting the title. He said: \"Either you have a leader of the opposition, or you do not have it. There's no need to have an unofficial leader of the opposition.\" He also noted that the title appeared \"derogatory\" to him because it implied that \"you only qualify as unofficial\". Pritam Singh took over as the Leader of Opposition upon being elected as WP's new secretary-general on 8 April 2018.\n\nThe primary role of a party whip in Parliament is to enforce party discipline and ensure that sufficient numbers of MPs from his or her political parties attend sittings of the House and vote along party lines. From time to time, a whip may \"lift the whip\" and allow MPs to vote according to their consciences. In March 2009, the whip was lifted for PAP MPs during debates on amendments to the Human Organ Transplant Act that would permit financial compensation to be paid to organ donors. A whip also schedules the MPs that will speak for each item of Parliamentary business.\n\nThe present government whip is Janil Puthucheary, assisted by two deputy government whips, Sim Ann and Zaqy Mohamad. The party whip for the Workers' Party is Low Thia Khiang, and the deputy party whip is Sylvia Lim.\n\nA select committee is a committee made up of a small number of MPs appointed to deal with particular areas or issues. Standing select committees (that is, permanently constituted committees) are either chaired by the Speaker of Parliament or an MP appointed to the position, and its members are usually up to seven MPs appointed by Parliament in a manner that ensures that, so far as is possible, the balance between the Government benches and the Opposition benches in Parliament is reflected in the Committee. Parliament may also appoint \"ad hoc\" select committees to deal with other matters, such as to study the details of bills that are before Parliament. In addition, if Parliament resolves that NMPs will be appointed during its term, a special select committee on nominations for appointment as NMP is established to consider suggestions for nominees submitted by members of the public.\n\nA standing select committee continues for the duration of a Parliament unless Parliament otherwise provides, while other select committees last until they have presented their final reports. A prorogation of Parliament (see below) does not cause the business and proceedings before select committees to lapse; these are proceeded with in the next session of the same Parliament.\n\nGovernment Parliamentary Committees (GPCs) were established by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in 1987. GPCs are Party organs, and were not set up because they are required by any provision of the Constitution or constitutional convention. Each GPC examines the policies, programmes and proposed legislation of a particular government ministry, provides the ministry with feedback and suggestions, and is consulted by the ministry on issues of public interest.\n\nThe members of GPCs are PAP backbenchers, and each GPC is backed by a resource panel that members of the public are invited to join. When GPCs were introduced, Goh Chok Tong, then First Deputy Prime Minister, said that the three main reasons for establishing GPCs were to increase the participation of MPs in policymaking, to give the public a say in government policies through sitting on resource panels, and to strengthen democratic institutions in the country. It was envisaged that GPC members would act as a sort of proxy opposition in Parliament, challenging the views of Cabinet members. However, in the 1991 general election the PAP lost four seats to opposition parties and suffered a 2.2% drop in popular votes compared to the 1988 election. Goh, who had become Prime Minister in 1990, said in a post-election press conference that GPCs would be abolished as the increased number of Opposition MPs meant they were no longer needed. The PAP would return to the old system of having internal party committees meeting in private. A few weeks later, he said that GPCs would continue to exist, but their members would no longer take an adversarial stance in Parliament.\n\nAs of 13 November 2015 there were 12 GPCs dealing with the following matters:\n\n\nPrior to this date, there were 11 GPCs. The changes were due to the reorganization of the GPC for National Development and Environment into two separate GPCs – one for National Development, the other for Environment and Water Resources — corresponding to their respective ministries.\n\nThe administration of Parliament is managed by its secretariat. Among other things, the secretariat organizes the business of Parliament and its committees, managing tasks such as the simultaneous interpretation of debates in the House and the preparation of Hansard (the official reports of Parliamentary debates). The secretariat also assists with the work of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization.\n\nThe Clerk of Parliament is the chief executive of the secretariat. As of 2009, the clerk is Ms. Ng Sheau Jiuan. She is the principal adviser to the House on parliamentary procedures and practices. When Parliament is sitting, she is stationed at the Clerk's Table below the Speaker's chair, and reads the orders of the day. The clerk is appointed by the president after consultation with the Speaker and the Public Service Commission. She is supported by a deputy clerk, principal assistant clerks and assistant clerks. The independence of the clerk and her staff are protected to some extent by the Constitution. The clerk can only be removed from office on the grounds of inability to discharge the functions of the office (whether arising from an infirmity of body or mind or any other cause) or for misbehaviour, and a parliamentary resolution that has received the affirmative votes of not less than two-thirds of all MPs is required. Further, the staff of Parliament are not eligible for promotion or transfer to any other office in the public service without the Speaker's consent.\n\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms is the officer of Parliament who has the duty of maintaining order in the precincts of the House. For instance, if the conduct of any MP is grossly disorderly during a sitting of Parliament, the Speaker or a committee chairman may order him or her to withdraw immediately from Parliament for the rest of the day's sitting, and the Speaker or chairman may instruct the Serjeant to enforce the order. The Speaker may also direct an MP to withdraw when Parliament has voted to suspend him or her for committing the offence of disregarding the authority of the chair or of persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of Parliament. If the MP refuses to obey this direction despite having been summoned several times to do so by the Serjeant acting under the Speaker's orders, the Serjeant may use force to compel the MP's obedience to the direction.\n\nThe Serjeant-at-Arms is also the custodian of the Mace of Parliament, and bears the Mace into and out of the chamber of the House – the room where Parliamentary debates take place – during sittings (see below).\n\nThe legislative power of Singapore is vested in the Legislature of Singapore, which consists of the president and Parliament. One of the Legislature's major functions is lawmaking. As Singapore is an independent and sovereign republic, Parliament has plenary power to pass laws regulating the rights and liabilities of persons in the country and elsewhere. The power of the Legislature to make laws is exercised by Parliament passing bills and the president assenting to them. The president's role in the exercise of legislative power is nominal. He may address Parliament and may send messages to it, and must assent to most bills, which then become law.\n\nA bill is a draft law. In Singapore, most bills are government bills; they are introduced in Parliament by ministers on behalf of the Cabinet. However, any MP can introduce a bill. A bill introduced by an MP who is not a minister is known as a private member's bill. Because the Government currently holds a majority of the seats in Parliament, a private member's bill will not be passed unless it gains the Government's support. Three private members' bills have been introduced since 1965. The first was the Roman Catholic Archbishop Bill, a private bill that was introduced by P. Selvadurai and Chiang Hai Ding in 1974 and passed the following year. The first public law that originated from a private member's bill is the Maintenance of Parents Act, which entitles parents at least 60 years old and unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them. The bill was introduced on 23 May 1994 by Walter Woon, who was then an NMP, and eventually passed on 2 November 1995. In that year, the first woman NMP, Dr. Kanwaljit Soin, also introduced a Family Violence Bill but it did not pass.\n\nAll bills must go through three readings in Parliament and receive the president's assent to become an Act of Parliament. The first reading is a mere formality, during which a bill is introduced without a debate. The bill is considered as having been read after the MP introducing it has read aloud its long title and laid a copy of it on the Table of the House, and the Clerk of Parliament has read out its short title. Copies of the bill are then distributed to MPs, and it is published in the \"Government Gazette\" for the public's information. The bill is then scheduled for its second reading.\n\nDuring the second reading, MPs debate the general principles of the bill. If Parliament opposes the bill, it may vote to reject it. If the bill goes through its second reading, it proceeds to the committee stage where the details of the drafting of the proposed law are examined. Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs present at the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause. At this stage, MPs who support the bill in principle but do not agree with certain clauses can propose amendments to those clauses. Bills that are more controversial, or for which it is desired to obtain views from interested groups or the public, are often referred to a select committee. This is a committee made up of MPs who invite interested persons to submit representations on a bill. Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may also be held. Where the Speaker of Parliament is of the opinion that a bill appears to prejudicially affect individual rights or interests (such a bill is known as a hybrid bill) it must be referred to a select committee, and the committee must hear any affected party who has presented a petition to Parliament. The select committee then reports its findings, together with any suggested amendments to the bill, to Parliament.\n\nFollowing the committee stage, the bill goes through its third reading. During this stage the principles behind the bill can no longer be questioned, and only minor amendments will be allowed. The bill is then voted upon. In most cases, a simple majority of all the MPs present and voting is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.\n\nA minister may lay on the Table of the House a certificate of urgency that the president has signed for a proposed bill or a bill that has already been introduced. Once this is done, provided that copies of the bill are provided to MPs, the bill may be proceeded with throughout all its stages until it has been read the third time.\n\nMost bills passed by Parliament are scrutinized by a non-elected advisory body called the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR), which reports to the Speaker of Parliament whether there is any clause in a bill that contains a \"differentiating measure\", that is, one which discriminates against any racial or religious community. When the council makes a favourable report or no report within 30 days of the bill being sent to it (in which case the bill is conclusively presumed not to contain any differentiating measures), the bill is presented to the President for assent.\n\nIf the PCMR submits an adverse report, Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the president's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all MPs. The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in 1970.\n\nThree types of bills need not be submitted to the PCMR:\n\nBefore a bill officially becomes law, the president must assent to it. The president exercises this constitutional function in accordance with Cabinet's advice and does not act in his personal discretion; thus, except in certain instances described below, he may not refuse to assent to bills that have been validly passed by Parliament. The words of enactment in Singapore statutes are: \"Be it enacted by the President with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Singapore, as follows:\".\n\nThe president may act in his discretion in withholding assent to any of the following types of bills passed by Parliament:\n\nAs regards a bill mentioned in paragraph 1, the president, acting in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal the question of whether the bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the president is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the president either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill will only become law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill mentioned in paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the president's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.\n\nIf the president withholds his assent to any Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill referred to in paragraph 5 contrary to the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers, Parliament may by resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the total number of elected MPs overrule the decision of the president. If Parliament does not do so within 30 days of the withholding of assent, it may authorize expenditure or supplementary expenditure, from the Consolidated Fund and Development Fund during the relevant financial year, provided that:\n\n\nIf 30 days have passed after a Supply Bill, Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill has been presented to the President for assent and her or she has not signified the withholding of assent, the president is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the expiration of the 30-day period.\n\nUpon receiving presidential assent, a bill becomes law and is known as an Act of Parliament. However, the Act only comes into force on the date of its publication in the \"Government Gazette\", or on such other date that is stipulated by the Act or another law, or a notification made under a law.\n\nAll revenues of Singapore that are not allocated to specific purposes by law are paid into a Consolidated Fund. In addition, there exists a Development Fund, which is used for purposes relating to matters such as:\n\nThe Government may only withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund and Development Fund if authorized by a Supply law, Supplementary Supply law or Final Supply law passed by Parliament. In this way, Parliament exerts a degree of financial control over the Government as the latter's budget must be approved each year following a debate in the House. However, at present it is virtually certain that the Government's budgets will be approved as it holds a majority of seats in Parliament, and MPs are required by party discipline to vote according to the party line.\n\nThe annual budget approval process begins with the Minister for Finance presenting a Budget Statement in Parliament. This usually takes place in late February or early March before the start of the financial year on 1 April. The Budget Statement assesses the performance of Singapore's economy in the previous year and provides information about the Government's financial policy for the coming financial year, including details about tax changes or incentives to be introduced. The Budget Book is presented together with the Budget Statement. This sets out estimates of how each Government ministry proposes to use the public funds allocated to it in the budget in the next financial year. Following the Minister's budget speech, Parliament stands adjourned for not less than seven clear days.\n\nWhen Parliament resumes sitting, two days are allotted for a debate on the Budget Statement, after which Parliament votes on a motion to approve the Government's financial policy as set out in the Statement. Parliament then constitutes itself as the Committee of Supply and debates the estimates of expenditure. During the debates, MPs are entitled to question Ministers on their ministries' policies after giving notice of their intention to move amendments to reduce by token sums of S$100 the total amounts provisionally allocated to particular heads of expenditure. The Committee of Supply debates usually last between seven and ten days, and upon their conclusion a Supply Bill is passed. The enacted law is called a Supply Act.\n\nIf the Government wishes to spend public money in addition to what was provided for in the budget, it must submit supplementary estimates to Parliament for approval. If the financial year has not yet ended, such supplementary estimates are passed in the form of a Supplementary Supply Act. As soon as possible after the end of each financial year, the Minister for Finance must introduce into Parliament a Final Supply Bill containing any sums which have not yet been included in any Supply Bill. This is enacted by Parliament as a Final Supply Act.\n\nA crucial reason why governmental powers are separated among three branches of government – the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary – is so that the exercise of power by one branch may be checked by the other two branches. In addition to approving the Government's expenditure of public funds, Parliament exercises a check over the Cabinet through the power of MPs to question the Prime Minister and other Ministers regarding the Government's policies and decisions. MPs may put questions to Ministers relating to affairs within their official functions, or bills, motions or other public matters connected with the business of Parliament for which they are responsible. Questions may also be put to other MPs relating to matters that they are responsible for. However, this is a weak check when most of the MPs are members of the political party in power, as they are constrained by party discipline to adhere to the policies it espouses.\n\nUnless a question is urgent and relates to a matter of public importance or to the arrangement of public business and the Speaker's permission has been obtained to ask it, to pose a question an MP must give not later than seven clear days' written notice before the sitting day on which the answer is required. An MP may ask up to five questions at any one time, not more than three of which may be for oral answer. Detailed rules govern the contents of questions. For instance, questions must not contain statements which the MP is not prepared to substantiate; or arguments, inferences, opinions, imputations, epithets or tendentious, ironical or offensive expressions; and a question must not be asked to obtain an expression of opinion, the solution of an abstract legal case or the answer to a hypothetical proposition.\n\nMPs' questions requiring oral answers are raised during Question Time, which is usually one and a half hours from the commencement of each Parliamentary sitting. Written answers are sent to the MP and to the Clerk of Parliament, who circulates the answer to all MPs and arranges for it to be printed in Hansard.\n\nParliament regulates and ensure the orderly conduct of its own proceedings and the despatch of business through the Standing Orders of Parliament, which it is entitled to make, amend and revoke. If there is any matter not provided for by the Standing Orders, or any question relating to the interpretation or application of any Standing Order, the Speaker of Parliament decides how it should be dealt with. He may have regard to the practice of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, but is not bound to follow it.\n\nParliament convenes when it is in session. The first session of a particular Parliament commences when Parliament meets after being formed following a general election. Each year there must be at least one session, and not more than six months must intervene between the last sitting of Parliament in any session and the first sitting in the next session. Each Parliament generally has two sessions, although the Seventh Parliament had three sessions: 9 January 1989 to 2 April 1990, 7 June 1990 to 29 January 1991, and 22 February to 14 August 1991. A session usually opens with an address by the president drafted by the Cabinet, which sets out the Government's agenda for the session.\n\nA Parliamentary session concludes in one of two ways. First, the president, on Cabinet's advice, may prorogue Parliament by proclamation in the \"Government Gazette\". Prorogation has the effect of suspending the sitting of Parliament, but MPs retain their seats and it is not necessary for an election to be held. Uncompleted Parliamentary business is not affected by a prorogation, and is carried over from one session to the next. For instance, Standing Order 88(1) of the Standing Orders of Parliament states: \"A Bill before Parliament shall not lapse upon the prorogation of Parliament and all business and proceedings connected therewith shall be carried over to the next session of the same Parliament and continue from the stage that it had reached in the preceding session.\" The period between sessions is called a recess.\n\nSecondly, a session terminates when Parliament is dissolved. A dissolution puts an end to a particular Parliament, and all unfinished business is expunged. Dissolution occurs in the following circumstances:\n\n\nThe president is not permitted to dissolve Parliament following the giving of a notice of motion in Parliament proposing an inquiry into his conduct unless (1) a resolution is not passed pursuant to the notice of motion; (2) where a resolution has been passed, the tribunal appointed to inquire into the allegations against the president determines that he has not become permanently incapable of discharging the functions of his office or that he is not guilty of any other allegations; (3) following a tribunal report that is unfavourable to the president, Parliament does not successfully pass a resolution for the president's removal from office; or (4) Parliament by resolution requests him to dissolve Parliament.\n\nA general election must be held within three months after every dissolution of Parliament. The Prime Minister and other Ministers who make up the Cabinet do not vacate their offices upon a dissolution of Parliament, but continue in their posts until the first sitting of the next Parliament following a general election.\n\nUnless otherwise notified by the Speaker, a Parliamentary sitting begins at 1:30 pm. It begins with the Speaker's procession, during which the Serjeant-at-Arms enters the chamber of the House bearing the Mace of Parliament on his right shoulder ahead of the Speaker, the Clerk of Parliament, and the Clerk's assistants. Members of Parliament rise in their places upon the entry of the Speaker and bow to him, and he reciprocates. The mace is an ornamented staff that represents the Speaker's authority and is the Serjeant's emblem of office. When Parliament's predecessor, the Legislative Assembly, acquired the Mace in 1958, the Speaker, Sir George Oehlers, invited members to \"accept that the Mace is an essential part of the equipment of this Assembly and that this Assembly cannot, in future, be considered to be properly constituted unless the Mace be first brought into the House and laid on the Table\". The Mace is placed on the Table of the House, which is a table in the centre of the debating chamber between the front benches. There are two sets of brackets on the Table, and when the Speaker is in his chair the Mace is placed on the upper brackets. The Mace is removed to the lower brackets when the House sits as a committee, and is not brought into the chamber when the president addresses Parliament.\n\nThe quorum for a Parliamentary sitting is one quarter of the total number of MPs, not including the Speaker or someone presiding on his behalf. If any MP contends that there are insufficient MPs attending to form a quorum, the Speaker waits two minutes, then conducts a count of the MPs. If there is still no quorum, he must adjourn Parliament without putting any question.\n\nMPs must occupy the seats in the debating chamber allocated to them by the Speaker. The front benches (those nearest the Table of the House) on the Speaker's right are occupied by Government Ministers, and those on the left by Opposition MPs or by backbenchers. MPs may use any one of the four official languages of Singapore – Malay, English, Mandarin or Tamil – during debates and discussions. Simultaneous oral interpretation of speeches in Malay, Mandarin and Tamil into English and \"vice versa\" is provided by the Parliament Secretariat's Language Service Department.\n\nAt an ordinary sitting, the order of business in Parliament is as follows:\n\n\nEach debate in Parliament begins with a motion, which is a formal proposal that a certain course of action be taken by the House. The MP who moves a motion has not more than one hour for his or her opening speech explaining the reasons for the motion, but Parliament may vote to extend this time by 15 minutes. The Speaker (or chairman, if Parliament is in committee) then proposes the motion in the form of a question, following which other MPs may debate the motion. MPs who wish to speak must rise in their places and catch the eye of the Speaker. They may speak only if called upon by the Speaker. MPs must speak from the rostrum unless they are front benchers, in which case they may speak at the Table of the House if they wish. Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries may speak for up to one hour, while other MPs may speak for up to 30 minutes (15 minutes if addressing a Committee of the whole Parliament). In general, MPs may only speak once to any question, though they may be heard again to clarify their speeches if misunderstood or to seek a clarification of another MP's speech. If they do so, they are not allowed to introduce new matters. After MPs have spoken, the mover may exercise a right of reply for up to one hour; again, Parliament may grant an extension of up to 15 minutes.\n\nDuring debates, MPs must direct their observations to the Chair of the House occupied by the Speaker or a committee chairman, and not directly to another Member; the phrase \"Madam Speaker\" or \"Mr. Speaker, Sir\" is often used for this purpose. Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are addressed by the offices held by them (for example, \"the Honourable Minister for Trade and Industry\"), while other MPs are referred to by the constituencies they represent (\"the Honourable Member for Holland–Bukit Timah GRC\") or by their names. The use of the honorific \"the Honourable\" is not required by the Standing Orders of Parliament, but during a 1988 parliamentary debate the Leader of the House, Wong Kan Seng, said it would be polite for MPs to refer to their colleagues using the terms \"Mr.\", \"Honourable Mr.\" or \"Honourable Minister\" depending on their choice.\n\nMPs must confine their observations to the subject being discussed and may not talk about irrelevant matters, and will be ruled out of order if they use offensive and insulting language about other MPs. They are also not permitted to impute improper motives to other MPs, or to refer to the conduct or character of any MP or public servant other than that person's conduct as an MP or public servant. There are restrictions on discussing the conduct of the president or a Judge or Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court; and referring to matters that are \"sub judice\" (pending before a court), though when a bill is being considered such cases can be discussed in a way that does not prejudice the parties to the case.\n\nTo bring a debate to a close, an MP may move \"that the question be now put\". The debate ends if the motion is carried (that is, a majority of MPs vote to support the motion). The Speaker then puts the question on the original motion to the House and calls for a vote. To determine whether this motion is carried, the Speaker will \"collect the voices\" by saying, \"As many as are of that opinion say 'Aye'\", and MPs supporting the motion will respond \"Aye\". The Speaker then says \"To the contrary say 'No'\", and MPs opposing the motion will say \"No\". Following this, the Speaker assesses the number of votes and says, \"I think the Ayes (or Noes) have it\". At this point, an MP may challenge the Speaker's decision by claiming a division. If at least five other MPs rise in their places to support the challenge, the Speaker will direct that the division bells be rung for at least a minute. After that, the Speaker orders the Serjeant-at-Arms to lock the doors of the chamber. The Speaker then puts the question a second time. If a division is again claimed, the Speaker asks each MP to vote \"Aye\" or \"No\", or to indicate that he or she is abstaining from voting. MPs must vote in the same way as they did when voices were taken collectively. Votes and abstentions are recorded using an electronic system. If it appears that a quorum is not present, the division is invalid and the matter is postponed till the next sitting. Otherwise, the Speaker states the numbers of MPs voting \"Aye\" and \"No\" and declares the results of the division. The Serjeant then unlocks the doors.\n\nA Minister may make a statement in Parliament on a matter of public importance. MPs are allowed to seek clarification on the statement but no debate is allowed on it.\n\nIf Parliament decides, a sitting may be suspended at any time after 3:15 pm, and if so suspended resumes at 3:45 pm. The Speaker may also direct that the sitting be suspended at other times. At 7:00 pm the \"moment of interruption\" is reached. At that point, the proceedings on any business being considered are interrupted and deferred, together with the remaining items of business that have not yet been dealt with, to the next sitting day unless the MPs in charge of the items of business name alternative sitting days for the deferred business to be taken up again. When proceedings have been interrupted or if all items of business have been completed, a Minister must move \"That Parliament do now adjourn\". Upon that motion, a debate may take place during which any matter that Cabinet is responsible for may be raised by an MP who has obtained the right to raise such a matter for 20 minutes. Each sitting day, only one MP is allotted the right to raise a matter on the motion for the adjournment of Parliament.\n\nAn MP can ask for leave to move the adjournment of Parliament for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance. If the MP obtains the general assent of Parliament or at least eight MPs rise in their places to support the motion, the motion stands adjourned until 5:30 pm on the same day. At that time, any proceedings on which Parliament is engaged are suspended so that the urgent matter may be raised. Proceedings on the motion for adjournment may continue until the moment of interruption, whereupon if they have not been completed the motion lapses. The postponed proceedings are resumed either on the disposal or the lapse of the motion for adjournment. Not more than one such motion for adjournment may be made at any one sitting.\n\nThe Constitution provides that the Legislature may by law determine and regulate the privileges, immunities or powers of Parliament. The first such law was enacted in 1962 prior to Singapore's independence by the Legislative Assembly. The current version of that statute is the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act.\n\nIn general, the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of the Speaker, MPs and committees of Parliament are the same as those of the United Kingdom House of Commons and of its Speaker, Members or committees at the establishment of the Republic of Singapore on 9 August 1965. Such privileges, immunities and powers have effect even though they are not expressly prescribed by the Act, and are required to be judicially noticed in all courts.\n\nThe Act provides that there shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament, and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings is not liable to be impeached or questioned in any court, commission of inquiry, committee of inquiry, tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament.\n\nMPs are not liable to the following:\n\nNo civil or criminal process (official notice of legal proceedings) may be served or executed on any person in Parliament or in its precincts while Parliament is sitting, or in any room in Parliament while a committee is sitting in it, except for a contravention of the Act.\n\nNo person is liable to any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages by reason of any act done under the authority of Parliament or the Speaker and within its or his or her legal powers or under any warrant issued by virtue of those powers. Thus, defamation proceedings cannot be brought against a member of the public on the basis of statements in a written representation sent by him to a select committee of Parliament in response to an invitation that the Clerk of Parliament has issued.\n\nReports, papers or journals that are published by order or under the authority of Parliament are absolutely privileged. If civil or criminal proceedings (for instance, for defamation or sedition) are brought against a person or his or her employee for the publication, the person may give the court a certificate from the Speaker or Clerk of Parliament stating that the documents were published by order of Parliament or under its authority. The court must then immediately stay the proceedings. Further, in any civil or criminal proceedings started for printing or publishing any extract from or abstract of any document published under Parliament's authority, the court must grant judgment in favour of the defendant or accused if satisfied that the extract or abstract was printed or published \"bona fide\" and without malice.\n\nIf an MP acts dishonourably, abuses a privilege or behaves contemptuously, Parliament may:\n\nIt is for Parliament alone to determine what actions constitute an abuse of privilege and contempt, and the procedure for reaching a decision. On 19 March and 30 July 1986 the Leader of the House objected in Parliament to Opposition MP J.B. Jeyaretnam's allegations that the executive had interfered with the judiciary. The complaints were considered by the Committee of Privileges in September. While the hearing was in progress, Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the proceedings of the Committee and sent them to residents of his constituency. On 9 October, the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters' contents to the Speaker of Parliament, which the Committee also considered. On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee's reports on the complaints and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters. Fines totalling $26,000 were imposed. Upon Jeyaretnam's refusal to pay the fines, civil suits to recover them were brought against him by the Attorney-General acting on the Government's behalf. Jeyaretnam challenged the suits on the grounds that the Committee had been wrong in law in finding him guilty of contempt, that Parliament could not lawfully punish him by imposing fines, and that natural justice had been breached as he had not been given an opportunity to be heard. However, he failed in his appeals to the High Court and the Court of Appeal, both courts holding that the determinations made by Parliament could not be challenged in court.\n\nWhere an MP has been found guilty of abuse of privilege in respect of anything said in Parliament by him or her, Parliament may order a suspension from privileges and immunities relating to liability to civil proceedings.\n\nParliament may exclude any officer of Parliament or stranger (that is, a person who is neither an MP nor an officer of Parliament) from any Parliamentary sitting, and regulate the admission of strangers to any sitting.\n\nIf a stranger commits a contempt, Parliament may:\n\nParliament and any committee of Parliament may also exercise the following powers:\n\nKey parliamentary sessions such as the budget statement and the opening of Parliament are broadcast live on both TV and online. Parliamentary highlights are hosted by Mediacorp's subsidiary ChannelNewsAsia through its microsite for a duration of six months. Permissions have to be sought from Ministry of Communication and Information and the Member(s) of Parliament featured, for release of all other Parliamentary videos, before purchase can be made through MediaCorp.\nComplaints filed by ChannelNewsAsia over copyright issues of a Parliamentary video hosted on the Online Citizens Facebook page had resulted in a takedown action. The government had subsequently clarified that it owns the copyright of the Parliamentary videos.\n\nBetween 1954 and 1999, Singapore's legislature met at what is now called the Old Parliament House. The building was originally a private mansion designed in the Palladian style by George Drumgoole Coleman and completed in June 1827 for a merchant, John Argyle Maxwell. Instead of living in it, Maxwell leased it to the Government for use as Singapore's first courthouse. The building was eventually sold to Governor George Bonham and the East India Company in October 1842. It served as a courthouse up to 1865, and again from 1875 until 1939, when the courts moved to a purpose-built Supreme Court Building on St. Andrew's Road. The building fell into disrepair and was used as a government storehouse during and after World War II.\n\nIn 1953, Governor John Nicoll decided that the building should be renovated for use as a legislative chamber. Renamed Assembly House, it was declared officially open on 9 July 1954, and the existing Legislative Council had its first meeting there on 20 July. It was then occupied from 1955 by the newly formed Legislative Assembly of Singapore, and was renamed Parliament House when Singapore became fully independent in 1965. In 1988 the building's debating chamber was extensively renovated to increase the number of seats in it to 90. However, as further extensions were not feasible without causing MPs discomfort and disrupting the chamber's configuration, plans were approved in 1992 for a new Parliament building to be constructed. The present Parliament House, on a part of High Street that was renamed Parliament Place, was completed in July 1999. It was officially inaugurated on 6 September 1999 with a special sitting that began in the Old Parliament House, continued with legislators walking from the old building to the new one, and concluded in the new Parliament House. Three items from the old chamber were brought over: the Mace of Parliament, the Table of the House, and the Speaker's chair. The building formerly occupied by Parliament reopened in March 2004 as a performance venue called the Arts House at the Old Parliament, and the street it is on was renamed Old Parliament Lane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

It was built in 1937 by the nascent Islamic community (then mostly Sunni Muslims from the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon), and was only the second mosque constructed in the United States. The building is three stories high and almost an entire city block on the intersection of Vernor and Dix Streets.\n\nThe number of people attending grew rapidly through the 1960s to 1980s. In the early 1980s, the mosque obtained a court order permitting it to broadcast the call to prayer using loudspeakers, overruling objections from some of its neighbors; it was the first mosque in America to do so. The court ruled that it was the Muslim equivalent of church bells.\n\nThe mosque is led by Sheikh Hamood Afif; before him, it was led by Sheikh Mohamed Musa for many years.\n\nDearborn Mosque is not to be confused with the Islamic Center of America, also in Dearborn, which was the nation's largest mosque when it opened in 2005.\n\n"}

{"id": "1890803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890803", "title": "Ernest Thesiger", "text": "Ernest Thesiger\n\nErnest Frederic Graham Thesiger, CBE (15 January 1879 – 14 January 1961) was an English stage and film actor. He is noted for his performance as Doctor Septimus Pretorius in James Whale's film, \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935).\n\nThe grandson of the 1st Lord Chelmsford, Thesiger was born in London, England. He was the first cousin once removed of the explorer and author Wilfred Thesiger (1910–2003), and the nephew of the 2nd Lord Chelmsford, who, exactly a week after Ernest's birth, famously led his troops in battle against – and suffered a defeat at the hands of – a Zulu army at the Battle of Isandlwana.\n\nThesiger attended Marlborough College and the Slade School of Art with aspirations of becoming a painter, but quickly switched to drama, making his professional debut in a production of \"Colonel Smith\" in 1909. He also processed with the Men's League for Womens Suffrage at the mass rally in 1909.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I, on 31 August 1914, he volunteered with the British Army's Territorial Force, enlisting into the 2nd Battalion of the 9th London Regiment (Queen Victoria's Rifles), as Rifleman No.2546 at its Regimental Headquarters in London's West End. After training in England for three months, he was sent to the Western Front in late 1914 with the Q.V.R.'s 1st Battalion. \n\nOn 1 January 1915, he was wounded in the trenches, and medically evacuated back to England. His interest in needlework had begun with buying and repairing pieces of historical embroidery with his brother in law William Ranken whilst in France. After the incident in a barn explosion, his hands had been damaged and on return home, despite the Ministry of Pensions declaring it “too effeminate an occupation for men”, Thesiger developed small sewing kits for soldiers similarly injured to provide activity and pain relief. This became The Disabled Soldiers' Embroidery Industry, 42 Edbury Street, London. As Honorary Secretary Cross-Stitch, Thesiger was convinced that needlework could improve injured men's morale and earn some money, as he also obtained commissions, including an altar frontal for private use in Buckingham Palace. \n\nAt a dinner party shortly after his return, someone asked him what it had been like in France, to which he is supposed to have responded \"Oh, my dear, the noise! and the people!\"\n\nIn 1917, he married Janette Mary Fernie Ranken (1877–1970), sister of his close friend and fellow Slade graduate William Bruce Ellis Ranken. In her biography of Thesiger's friend, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Hilary Spurling suggests that Thesiger and Janette wed largely out of their mutual adoration of William, who shaved his head when he learned of the engagement. Another source states more explicitly that Thesiger made no secret of his bisexuality.\n\nThesiger moved in several artistic, literary and theatrical circles, and is reported to have spent time with Queen Mary, both doing needlework and commenting on the sexuality of proposed honours nominees . At various times, he frequented the studio of John Singer Sargent, befriended Mrs. Patrick Campbell, visited and corresponded with Percy Grainger and worked closely with George Bernard Shaw, who wrote the role of the Dauphin in \"Saint Joan\" for him. Somerset Maugham, on the other hand, responded to Thesiger's inquiry as to why he wrote no parts for him with the quip, “But I am always writing parts for you, Ernest. The trouble is that somebody called Gladys Cooper will insist on playing them.” Thesiger was in the cast of Maugham's highly successful 1921 play \"The Circle\", produced at the Haymarket Theatre (also with Fay Compton and Leon Quartermaine).\n\nThesiger first came to public notice in the farce \"A Little Bit of Fluff\" by Walter W. Ellis at the Criterion Theatre in 1915-18. He played the comic hero Bertrand Tully over 1,200 times, and received very favourable reviews. The \"London Standard\" wrote, “The character of Bertram Tully...is one of the happiest seen on the stage for a decade past...Mr. Ernest Thesiger achieved a real triumph.” He reprised the role in the 1919 film version, and in a 1923 revival at the Ambassadors Theatre.\n\nIn 1925, Thesiger appeared in drag in Noël Coward's \"On with the Dance\", and later played the Dauphin in Shaw's \"Saint Joan\". He wrote an autobiography \"Practically True\", published in 1927, which covers his stage career. An unpublished memoir written near the end of his life is housed in the Ernest Thesiger Collection at the University of Bristol Theatre Collection.\n\nThesiger made his film debut in 1916 in \"The Real Thing at Last\", a spoof presenting \"Macbeth\" as it might be done by an American company, in which he did a drag turn as one of the Witches. Thesiger also played the First Witch in a 1941 production of \"Macbeth\" directed by John Gielgud. He performed more small roles in films during the silent era, but worked mainly on the stage. He had a larger role in an early film for director Alfred Hitchcock, the silent \"Number 13\" (1922), but this was never completed due to lack of funds.\n\nWhen he appeared in a Christmas production of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" in 1919, Thesiger met and befriended James Whale. After Whale moved to Hollywood and had found success with the films \"Journey's End\" (1930) and \"Frankenstein\" (1931), the director was commissioned to direct the screen adaptation of J. B. Priestley's \"Benighted\" as \"The Old Dark House\" (1932), starring Charles Laughton in his first American film, together with Boris Karloff and Raymond Massey. Whale immediately cast Thesiger in the film as Horace Femm, launching his Hollywood career. The following year Thesiger appeared (as a Scottish butler) with Karloff in a British film \"The Ghoul\".\n\nWhen Whale agreed to direct \"Bride of Frankenstein\" in 1935, he insisted on casting Thesiger as Dr. Septimus Pretorius, instead of the studio's choice of Claude Rains. Partly inspired by Mary Shelley's friend John Polidori and largely based on the Renaissance physician and botanist Paracelsus, it became Thesiger's most famous role.\n\nArriving in the United States for the filming of \"Bride of Frankenstein\", Thesiger immediately set up a display in his hotel suite of all his needlework, each with a price tag, and during the making of the film he would work on needlework, one of his hobbies.\n\nOriginally cast to play the luddite sculptor Theotocopolous in H.G. Wells's \"Things to Come\" (1936), Thesiger's performance was deemed unsuitable by the author, and so was replaced by Cedric Hardwicke, although he was retained on the parallel production of Wells's \"The Man Who Could Work Miracles\". Around this same time Thesiger published a book, \"Adventures in Embroidery\", about needlework, which was his expert hobby.\n\nThe remainder of Thesiger's career was centered on the theatrical stage, though he did appear in supporting roles in films produced in Britain, prominent among which is \"The Man in the White Suit\" (1951), starring Alec Guinness. He plays “Sir John,” the most powerful, the richest, and the oldest of the industrialists (jointly with the trade unions) trying to suppress Guinness's invention of a fabric that never wears out and never gets dirty.\n\nThesiger made several appearances on Broadway, notably as Jacques to Katharine Hepburn's Rosalind in the longest-running production of \"As You Like It\" ever produced on Broadway. Later films included \"The Horse's Mouth\" (1958) with Alec Guinness, \"Sons and Lovers\" (1960), and \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\", with Vivien Leigh and Warren Beatty (1961). That same year he made his final stage appearance—a mere week before his death—in \"The Last Joke\", with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.\n\nIn 1960, Thesiger was awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was Vice Patron of the Embroiderers Guild. His last film appearance was a small role in \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" (1962). Shortly after completing it, Thesiger died in his sleep from natural causes on the eve of his 82nd birthday. His body was buried in Brompton Cemetery in London.\n\nIn the fictionalised James Whale biopic \"Gods and Monsters\" (1998), Thesiger was portrayed by Arthur Dignam. And the real Thesiger is seen in the film when Brendan Fraser, as Whale's gardener, sits at a bar watching a televised showing of the original 1935 \"Bride of Frankenstein\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1890804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890804", "title": "Castiglion Fiorentino", "text": "Castiglion Fiorentino\n\nCastiglion Fiorentino () is a small, walled city in eastern Tuscany, Italy, in the province of Arezzo, between the cities of Arezzo and Cortona. It is known for its annual festivals and its Etruscan archeological site.\n\nCastiglion Fiorentino lies at the centre of a triangle formed by the cities of Florence, Siena and Perugia. Situated on a hilltop, above sea level, the town overlooks the Val di Chio and the Preappenines. Slightly more than 13,000 people live in the city (2013). The village of Manciano, known locally as \"Misericordia\", lies a mile to the west.\n\nDue to the overall infrastructure, town walls, and building architecture, for many years scholars considered the town to have been established in the late medieval time frame. More recent excavations, however, have found the remains of an Etruscan city wall (c. 4th century BC) underneath the current Piazzale del Cassero, and have discovered the remains of an Etruscan temple under one of the town's churches, la chiesa di Sant'Angelo, which was built in the twelfth century.\n\nDocuments from the 10th century mention a town named \"Castiglione\" in the feudal property of the Marquis of Monte Santa Maria. During the following century, the town became a part of the Diocese of Arezzo. From the 12th century the town was a free commune, until 1289 when, in the wake of the battle of Campaldino, it became part of the Republic of Florence. Arezzo and Siena joined forces against the Florentines in later years and reconquered Castiglione Aretino (as it was known then), which was then fortified under the direction of Bishop Guido Tarlati, Lord of Arezzo. Following Tarlati's death in 1336, Florence again gained control of Castiglione, until 1344, when it was acquired by Perugia, and renamed Castiglione Perugino. In 1369 the townspeople revolted against the Perugians, giving themselves to the Papal States; by 1384 the Florentines seized the town and bestowed its current name, Castiglione Fiorentino.\n\nDuring the 15th century, Castiglion Fiorentino suffered from repeated outbreaks of the plague, blamed at the time on the marshy areas surrounding the city. At the dawn of the 16th century, the Sienese army, led by Pietro Strozzi, gained control of the area, holding Castiglion Fiorentino until 1654, when the area became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. For the next two hundred years, the Medici Grand Dukes ruled the city, until in 1765 the House of Lorraine gained power. The new dynasty encouraged the reclamation of marshlands, leading to a period of economic and population growth for Castiglion Fiorentino.\n\nFrom 1800 to 1814, the town was garrisoned by Napoleon's troops. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the town was returned to Tuscany, to which it remained until 1861, when the Grand Duchy was annexed to the newly created Kingdom of Italy. Military activity during World War II damaged part of the town center as well as much of the surrounding countryside.\n\nThe first of the existing city walls, including Porta Fiorentina, the main entrance to the town's historical center, was erected in the 13th century, then enlarged in the 14th under the Perugians to connect the castle to the outside walls. An anti-gate containing the Medici coat of arms is located outside of the walls, while the inside of the gate is constructed of three arches under a statue of the town's patron saint, St. Michael. The town's fortress, the Cassero, was completed in 1367. In the 15th century, the nuns of San Girolamo used the fortress as a convent, and by the 19th century much of the fortress had been destroyed, with the remaining structure used as a prison.\n\nThe Pinacoteca, or Municipal Art Gallery, occupies the former church of Sant'Angelo. Built on the site of an Etruscan temple, the church of Sant'Angelo was built in Romanesque style between 1229 and 1239. The church has served as a hospital, wine cellar, and workshop before being renovated and used as an official museum and art gallery.\n\nIn 1513 Vasari constructed a nine arch loggia (Logge del Vasari) in Piazza del Comune, overlooking the valley. The Logge were restored once between 1560 and 1570 and then again in the first part of the 20th century.\n\nNearby is the Castello di Montecchio, which once was given to the British mercenary John Hawkwood.\n\nCastiglion also has many festivals throughout the year including the famous \"Palio dei Rioni\" on the third Sunday of June. Similar to the festival in Siena, the Palio dei Rioni is a horse race around Piazza Garibaldi, including a colourful and energetic display of the ancient custom of flag-waving, which dates back to the 13th century. During the week leading up to Easter Sunday, the parade along the city's streets, re-enacting a scene from the Passion as they have done annually for the past four hundred years.\n\nIn addition to the spring poppies, summer sunflowers and the famous Tuscan Cypress and Olive trees the beautiful green hillsides and country lanes are a must for any traveller any time of the year.\n\nMuch of the town's economy is based on agricultural and cattle ranching. Other residents are employed at pasta factories, sausage factories and sugarhouses. Some artisans create ceramics, and an additional 27% of the town's workers are employed by the service industry.\n\nYoung children are educated at a school within the town. Older children attend secondary school in Arezzo.\n\nIn June, 1989, Texas A&M University opened the Santa Chiara Study Center in Castiglion Fiorentino. Approximately 100 students from Texas A&M and other American universities, including Texas Tech University, University of Texas at Austin, Cal Poly Pomona, Colorado State University, University of Houston, and Kansas State University, study at Santa Chiara each semester, studying landscape architecture, art, architecture, literature, horticulture, music and international business. The Santa Chiara center is named after the building in which it is found, which is a former convent of the Order of Poor Clares. The building still contains the Church of Saint Clare (Santa Chiara in Italian), although it is now considered to be structurally unsound and is not used.

The organization works mainly in the United States but also focuses on developing countries. The Guttmacher Institute uses studies to help support policy making and program reform. The Institute is named after obstetrician-gynocologist and the former president of Planned Parenthood, Alan F. Guttmacher. The Guttmacher Institute has many sources of funding nationally and internationally. One of the Institute's biggest projects is keeping a running list of the reproductive health laws and policies throughout the United States.\n\nFounded in 1968, the Guttmacher Institute was originally called the Center for Family Planning Program Development and was a branch of Planned Parenthood. After Alan Guttmacher’s death, the Center for Family Planning Program Development was renamed and became an independent non-profit organization. In 2007, the organization officially split from Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute continually updates its analysis of state and national laws and policies about contraception and abortion. The Institute keeps a record of the restrictions that different states have put in place for reproductive health. The organization also keeps data about how teens are affected by pregnancy and the number of teens who use contraception. Internationally, the Guttmacher Institute uses methodologies to give an approximation of abortions in places where the data is not as accessible or the abortions happen outside of the health care setting.\n\nIn 2013, it was awarded a Population Center grant by the US National Institutes of Health in support of the Guttmacher Center for Population Research Innovation and Dissemination. The Guttmacher Institute has received Charity Navigator’s highest 4-star rating annually since 2010. In 2011 and 2013, the Institute was named the number one organization in the field of reproductive health by Philanthropedia.\n\nThe Institute was first started in 1968 as part of Planned Parenthood, with its funding being solely from Planned Parenthood. Once the Guttmacher Institute was no longer connected to Planned Parenthood in 2007, the organization only received less than 1% of its funding from Planned Parenthood in 2010. Now, most of the funding is gained through private foundations based in the United States. Other funding does come from international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The Guttmacher Institute was awarded $3.9 million between 1986 and 2015 by the MacArthur Foundation including 13 grants in population and reproductive health.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute isn’t affiliated with a political party, and so it is nonpartisan in the strict sense of the word. It is true that the group does work to \"ensure that all women are able to exercise their reproductive rights and responsibilities,\" which puts them among advocates of abortion rights. However, according to Factcheck.org, Guttmacher \"provides the most highly respected statistics on the sexual health of women and men. Its figures on abortion are widely cited by the media as well as by groups on both sides of the political aisle.\"\n\nSharon Camp, former CEO\n\n"}

Hayes, then CEO of Western and a customer of Wittig's at Salomon Brothers. At that time, Warren Buffett had taken over Salomon in the wake of a trading scandal \"and decided to cut the exorbitant compensation of the firm’s managing directors.\" Wittig accepted the Western invitation, and was named President in 1998 and Chairman and CEO in January 1999. He quickly became one of Topeka's most prominent citizens and was a generous contributor to local charities. Wittig supported the Multi-cultural Business Scholars Program at the University of Kansas and established a $250,000 scholarship in his family's name. He then purchased and renovated the mansion of former Kansas governor Alf Landon, the 1936 presidential nominee of the Republican Party. Wittig's remodeling of the home (appraised at roughly $2 million, compared to the median Topeka single family home value of $125,000) later became subject to much controversy.\n\nAmong other unconventional initiatives taken by Wittig at Westar, he \"bought around 30 percent of ADT, the home-security company, and then sold it for a pre-tax profit of $865 million to Tyco, making more for the staid utility in one year than it had made in many.\"\nIn 2002, it was revealed that there was some evidence that a Topeka banker had entered into an illegal loan with Wittig. The banker, Clinton (Del) Weidner, well known in Topeka for his charitable efforts, had informed Wittig that he was considering investing in a property development in Arizona and was in need of a $1.5 million loan to make a proper investment in the venture. Wittig loaned Weidner $1.5 million and Weidner increased the bank's line of credit to Wittig, ultimately by $2 million. The two men faced trial in 2003, and both were found guilty as charged. In February 2004, Weidner was sentenced to six years and six months in a federal prison in North Dakota. Wittig that same month was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1 million.\n\nConcurrent with the loan to Weidner becoming public, Wittig and corporate strategy vice president Douglas Lake resigned from Westar amid charges of \"looting\" the utility company. Prosecutors contended that the two men had unjustly compensated themselves and used the company jet for non-business-related matters. The two men were put to trial on 39 charges in fall 2004. The tide seemed to be in favor of the prosecution, but the trial ended with a hung jury in December. A retrial with an added 40th charge was conducted during the late summer of 2005. On September 12, Wittig was convicted of 39 counts while Lake was convicted of 30; both were convicted of the 40th charge, forfeiture, later that week. On April 4, 2006, US District Judge Julie Robinson sentenced Wittig to 18 years and ordered him to pay a $5 million fine in addition to $14.5 million in restitution. Wittig faced a maximum of 455 years behind bars and intended to appeal.\n\nOn January 5, 2007, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the convictions of Wittig and Lake in the Westar Energy case. Wittig was freed from prison on February 12, 2007.\n\nWittig was scheduled to be retried for the third time for looting Westar in September 2008. With delays, in July 2010, the new trial was set to begin September 20. However, the trial judge first was \"expected to rule whether to proceed at all (and, if so, on what basis), in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling [in June] on the conviction of the former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling, which appears to limit the government’s use of the so-called honest services statute to seek convictions in corruption cases. A motion to dismiss the case is before\" the judge, Julie A. Robinson.\n\nIn 2010 all charges against Wittig were dismissed.\n\nIn July, 2011, Wittig settled a dispute with Weststar Energy for back compensation owed him. The settlement amount received by Wittig was $36,000,000 in cash, $3,100,000 in legal fees incurred by Wittig, and $2,700,000 in stock compensation.\n"}

These planes of relative weakness are a result of the regular locations of atoms and ions in the crystal, which create smooth repeating surfaces that are visible both in the microscope and to the naked eye.\n\nCleavage forms parallel to crystallographic planes:\n\n\nCrystal parting occurs when minerals break along planes of structural weakness due to external stress or along twin composition planes. Parting breaks are very similar in appearance to cleavage, but only occur due to stress. Examples include magnetite which shows octahedral parting, the rhombohedral parting of corundum and basal parting in pyroxenes.\n\nCleavage is a physical property traditionally used in mineral identification, both in hand specimen and microscopic examination of rock and mineral studies. As an example, the angles between the prismatic cleavage planes for the pyroxenes (88–92°) and the amphiboles (56–124°) are diagnostic.\n\nCrystal cleavage is of technical importance in the electronics industry and in the cutting of gemstones.\n\nPrecious stones are generally cleaved by impact, as in diamond cutting.\n\nSynthetic single crystals of semiconductor materials are generally sold as thin wafers which are much easier to cleave. Simply pressing a silicon wafer against a soft surface and scratching its edge with a diamond scribe is usually enough to cause cleavage; however, when dicing a wafer to form chips, a procedure of scoring and breaking is often followed for greater control. Elemental semiconductors (Si, , and diamond) are diamond cubic, a space group for which octahedral cleavage is observed. This means that some orientations of wafer allow near-perfect rectangles to be cleaved. Most other commercial semiconductors (GaAs, InSb, etc.) can be made in the related zinc blende structure, with similar cleavage planes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890884", "title": "Nucleotide excision repair", "text": "Nucleotide excision repair\n\nNucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism. DNA damage occurs constantly because of chemicals (e.g. intercalating agents), radiation and other mutagens. Three excision repair pathways exist to repair single stranded DNA damage: Nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and DNA mismatch repair (MMR). While the BER pathway can recognize specific non-bulky lesions in DNA, it can correct only damaged bases that are removed by specific glycosylases. Similarly, the MMR pathway only targets mismatched Watson-Crick base pairs.\n\nNucleotide excision repair (NER) is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts - these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. Recognition of the damage leads to removal of a short single-stranded DNA segment that contains the lesion. The undamaged single-stranded DNA remains and DNA polymerase uses it as a template to synthesize a short complementary sequence. Final ligation to complete NER and form a double stranded DNA is carried out by DNA ligase. NER can be divided into two subpathways: global genomic NER (GG-NER or GGR) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER or TCR). The two subpathways differ in how they recognize DNA damage but they share the same process for lesion incision, repair, and ligation.\n\nThe importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins. Xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome are two examples of NER associated diseases.\n\nNucleotide excision repair is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes, but the general principle is similar. There are 9 major proteins involved in NER in mammalian cells. Deficiencies in certain proteins leads to disease; protein names are associated with the disease. XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPE, XPF, and XPG all derive from хeroderma pigmentosum and CSA and CSB represent proteins linked to Cockayne syndrome. Additionally, the proteins ERCC1, RPA, RAD23A, RAD23B, and others also participate in nucleotide excision repair. A more complete list of proteins involved in NER is found below.\n\nEukaryotic nucleotide excision repair can be divided into two subpathways: global genomic NER (GG-NER) and transcription coupled NER (TC-NER). Three different sets of proteins are involved in recognizing DNA damage for each subpathway. After damage recognition, the three subpathways converge for the steps of dual incision, repair, and ligation.\n\nGlobal genomic NER repairs damage in both transcribed and untranscribed DNA strands in active and inactive genes throughout the genome. This process is not dependent on transcription. This pathway employs several \"damage sensing\" proteins including the DNA-damage binding (DDB) and XPC-Rad23B complexes that constantly scan the genome and recognize helix distortions: the XPC-Rad23B complex is responsible for distortion recognition, while DDB1 and DDB2 (XPE) can also recognize some types of damage caused by UV light. Additionally, XPA performs a function in damage recognition that is as yet poorly defined. Upon identification of a damaged site, subsequent repair proteins are then recruited to the damaged DNA to verify presence of DNA damage, excise the damaged DNA surrounding the lesion then fill in the repair patch.\n\nMutations in GG-NER machinery are responsible for multiple genetic disorders including:\n\nAt any given time, most of the genome in an organism is not undergoing transcription; there is a difference in NER efficiency between transcriptionally silent and transcriptionally active regions of the genome. For many types of lesions, NER repairs the transcribed strands of transcriptionally active genes faster than it repairs nontranscribed strands and transcriptionally silent DNA.\n\nTC-NER and GG-NER differ only in the initial steps of DNA damage recognition. The principal difference between TC-NER and GG-NER is that TC-NER does not require XPC or DDB proteins for distortion recognition in mammalian cells. Instead TC-NER initiates when RNA polymerase stalls at a lesion in DNA: the blocked RNA polymerase serves as a damage recognition signal, which replaces the need for the distortion recognition properties of the XPC-RAD23B and DDB complexes. CS proteins (CSA and CSB) bind some types of DNA damage instead of XPC-Rad23B.\n\nOther repair mechanisms are possible but less accurate and efficient.\n\nTC-NER initiates when RNA polymerase stalls at a lesion in DNA, whereupon protein complexes help move the polymerase backwards. Mutations in TC-NER machinery are responsible for multiple genetic disorders including:\n\nTranscription factor II H (TFIIH) is the key enzyme involved in dual excision. TFIIH and XPG are first recruited to the site of DNA damage (XPG stabilizes TFIIH). The TFIIH subunits of XPD and XPB act as a 5'-3' and 3'-5' helicase, respectively - they help unwind DNA and generate a junction between the double-stranded and single-stranded DNA around the transcription bubble. In addition to stabilizing TFIIH, XPG also has endonuclease activity; it cuts DNA damage on the 3' side while the XPF–ERCC1 heterodimeric protein cuts on the 5' side. The dual incision leads to the removal of a ssDNA with a single strand gap of 25~30 nucleotides. The small, excised, damage-containing DNA (sedDNA) oligonucleotides are initially released from the duplex in complex with TFIIH but then dissociate in an ATP-dependent manner and become bound to replication protein A (RPA). Inhibition of gap filling DNA synthesis and ligation results in an accumulation of RPA-bound sedDNAs in the cell.\n\nReplication protein A (RPA) and XPA are the last two proteins associated with the main NER repair complex. These two proteins are present prior to TFIIH binding since they are involved with verifying DNA damage. They may also protect single-stranded DNA. After verification, the 5' side incision is made and DNA repair begins before the 3' side incision. This helps reduce exposed single stranded DNA during the repair process.\n\nReplication factor C (RFC) loads the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) onto the DNA strand. This allows DNA polymerases implicated in repair (δ, ε and/or κ) to copy the undamaged strand via translocation. DNA ligase I and Flap endonuclease 1 or the Ligase-III-XRCC1 complex seal the nicks to complete NER.\n\nThe process of nucleotide excision repair is controlled in \"Escherichia coli\" by the UvrABC endonuclease enzyme complex, which consists of four Uvr proteins: UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, and DNA helicase II (sometimes also known as UvrD in this complex). First, a UvrA-UvrB complex scans the DNA, with the UvrA subunit recognizing distortions in the helix, caused for example by pyrimidine dimers. When the complex recognizes such a distortion, the UvrA subunit leaves and an UvrC protein comes in and binds to the UvrB monomer and, hence, forms a new UvrBC dimer. UvrB cleaves a phosphodiester bond 4 nucleotides downstream of the DNA damage, and the UvrC cleaves a phosphodiester bond 8 nucleotides upstream of the DNA damage and created 12 nucleotide excised segment. DNA helicase II (sometimes called UvrD) then comes in and removes the excised segment by actively breaking the hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases. The resultant gap is then filled in using DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase. The basic excision process is very similar in higher cells, but these cells usually involve many more proteins – \"E.coli\" is a simple example.\n\nTC-NER also exists in bacteria, and is mediated by the TRCF (Mfd) protein. TRCF is an SF2 ATPase that uses ATP hydrolysis to translocate on dsDNA upstream of the transcription bubble and forward translocate RNA polymerase, thus initiating dissociation of the RNA Polymerase ternary elongation complex. TRCF also recruits the Uvr(A)BC nucleotide excision repair machinery by direct physical interaction with the UvrA subunit.\n\nThough historical studies have shown inconsistent results, genetic variation or mutation to nucleotide excision repair genes can impact cancer risk by affecting repair efficacy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nonsynonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) are present at very low levels (>1%) in the human population. If located in NER genes or regulatory sequences, such mutations can negatively affect DNA repair capacity resulting in an increase likelihood of cancer development. While the functional impact of all polymorphisms has not been characterized, some polymorphisms in DNA repair genes or their regulatory sequences do induce phenotypical changes and are involved in cancer development. A study of lung cancer cases found modest association between NER specific SNP polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. The results indicate that some inherited polymorphic variations in NER genes may result in predisposition to lung cancer, and potentially other cancer states.\n\nTwo important genes in the NER pathway for which polymorphism has shown functional and phenotypic impact are the XPD and XPC genes. XPD, also known as ERCC2, serves to open DNA around the site of damage during NER, in addition to other transcriptional activities. Studies have shown that polymorphisms at Exon 10 (G>A)(Asp312Asn) and Exon 23 (A>T)(Lys751Gln) are linked with genetic predisposition to several cancer types. The XPC gene is responsible for a protein which recognizes DNA during the early portion of the NER pathway. This gene can have polymorphisms at Intron 9 and SNPs in Exon 15 which have been correlated with cancer risk as well. Research has shown that a biallelic poly (AT) insertion/deletion polymorphism in Intron 9 of XPC is associated with increased risk for skin, breast and prostate cancers, especially in North Indian populations.\n\nThe study of a hereditary cancer, xeroderma pigmentosum has helped identify several genes which encode proteins in the NER pathway, two of which are XPC and XPD. XP is caused by a homozygous deficiency in UV DNA damage repair (GG-NER) which increases the patients’ risk of skin cancer by 1000-fold. In heterozygous patients, the risk of cancer is sporadic but can be predicted based on analytical assessment of polymorphisms in XP related DNA repair genes purified from lymphocytes. In a study relapse rates of high-risk stage II and III colorectal cancers, XPD (ERCC2) polymorphism 2251A>C was significantly correlated with early relapse after chemotherapeutic treatment. Studies have indicated that the effects of polymorphic NER genes is additive, with greater frequency of variants, greater cancer risk presents.\n\nIn humans and mice, germline mutation in genes employed in NER cause features of premature aging. These genes and their corresponding proteins include \"ERCC1\"(ERCC1), \"ERCC2\"(XPD), \"ERCC3\"(XPB), \"ERCC4\"(XPF), \"ERCC5\" (XPG), \"ERCC6\"(CSB) and \"ERCC8\"(CSA).\n\nDNA repair-deficient \"ERCC1\" mutant mice show features of accelerated aging, and have a limited lifespan. Accelerated aging in the mutant involves numerous organs.\n\nMutations in the \"ERCC2\"(XPD) gene can lead to various syndromes, either xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), trichothiodystrophy (TTD) or a combination of XP and TTD (XPTTD), or a combination of XP and Cockayne syndrome (XPCS). TTD and CS both display features of premature aging. These features may include sensorineural deafness, retinal degeneration, white matter hypomethylation, central nervous system calcification, reduced stature, and cachexia (loss of subcutaneous fat tissue). XPCS and TTD fibroblasts from \"ERCC2\"(XPD) mutant human and mouse show evidence of defective repair of oxidative DNA damages that may underlie the segmental progeroid (premature aging) symptoms (see DNA damage theory of aging).\n\nMutations in the \"ERCC3\"(XPB) gene can lead, in humans, to xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or XP combined with Cockayne syndrome (XPCS).\n\nDeficiency of \"ERCC4\"(XPF) in humans results in a variety of conditions including accelerated aging.\n\nIn humans, mutational defects in the \"ERCC5\"(XPG) gene can cause either the cancer-prone condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) alone, or in combination with the severe neurodevelopmental disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS) or the infantile lethal cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome. An \"ERCC5\"(XPG) mutant mouse model presents features of premature aging including cachexia and osteoporosis with pronounced degenerative phenotypes in both liver and brain. These mutant mice develop a multi-system premature aging degenerative phenotype that appears to strengthen the link between DNA damage and aging.(see DNA damage theory of aging).\n\nCockayne syndrome (CS) arises from germline mutations in either of two genes \"ERCC8\"(CSA) or \"ERCC6\"(CSB). \"ERCC8\"(CSA) mutations generally give rise to a more moderate form of CS than \"ERCC6\"(CSB) mutations. Mutations in the CSA gene account for about 20% of CS cases. Individuals with CSA and CSB are charactericed by severe postnatal growth and mental retardation and accelerated aging leading to premature death at the age of 12 to 16 years.\n\nAs reviewed by Gorbunova et al., studies of NER in different cells and tissues from young and old individuals frequently have shown a decrease in NER capacity with increasing age. This decline may be due to reduced constitutive levels of proteins employed in the NER pathway.\n\n"}

As Paisley, she made her in-ring singles debut against Tammy Lynn Sytch on the April 26, 2000, episode of \"WCW Thunder\", winning with a DDT. Following The Artist's release from WCW, Sullivan began valeting for Kwee Wee. She also formed an alliance with fellow former Nitro Girl Tygress, and the two ladies frequently double-teamed the Misfits In Action's valet Major Gunns.\n\nWhile in WCW, Sullivan was also a part of the pop music group \"Diversity 5\" with other Nitro Girls Fyre, Spice, Chae, and Tygress. In 2001, when she signed with the WWF, she was replaced in the group by Chiquita Anderson (also a Nitro Girl).\n\nIn 2001, just before WCW was bought by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Sullivan was released from WCW and signed a developmental contract with WWF with the intent of becoming a full-time in-ring performer and backstage interviewer. She was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling to continue her training, and was made the valet for The Suicide Blondes, wearing a blonde wig and using the name Sister Sharmell. Her training, however, was cut short by an injury, forcing her to retire from in-ring work. In November 2001, Sullivan was called up and put in a backstage interview position on Smackdown, which lasted until sometime in early 2002 before the company was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment. She retired from wrestling afterwards to run a clothing store in Houston, Texas.\n\nSullivan was re-hired by the (now renamed) World Wrestling Entertainment in the spring of 2005, debuting as a face valet for her real-life husband Booker T. Together they took part in a feud with Kurt Angle, during which he continually sexually harassed her. Sharmell began turning heel in October when she started interfering in Booker's matches, presumably without his knowledge. Her villainous turn was cemented she helped Booker win the United States Championship from Chris Benoit, which preceded a heel turn by Booker when he revealed he knew of her involvement in his matches the entire time.\n\nSullivan and Booker T then began a feud with The Boogeyman, and during a match at WrestleMania 22 he managed to kiss Sullivan while he had a mouth full of worms.\n\nAfter Booker T's victory in the 2006 King of the Ring tournament, Booker T began referring to himself as \"King Booker\" and Sharmell as \"Queen Sharmell\". As part of their new on-screen personas, the duo began speaking in faux British accents and acting pompous. On the April 6, 2007, episode of \"SmackDown!\" Sullivan turned on her husband, claiming his failure to defeat Matt Hardy that night—after he'd nearly attacked her during WrestleMania 23—meant he didn't care about her honor. Later that night, as part of the storyline, Booker tried to impress Sharmell by attacking World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker which ended in Booker being hit with a Tombstone piledriver on the announce table and sprained Booker's neck, which put him out of action. On the June 11 episode of \"Raw\", Sharmell (with King Booker) was drafted from \"SmackDown!\" to \"RAW\" as part of the WWE Draft. Due to conflicts with storyline and overall character direction, in October 2007, Sharmell, along with Booker, requested and were granted their releases from their contracts by WWE. She then made an appearance at the 2013 WWE Hall Of Fame to watch her husband get inducted.\n\nAt the Genesis pay per view on November 11, 2007, Sharmell debuted in TNA during the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match attacking Karen Angle.\n\nAt Final Resolution on January 6, 2008, Sharmell and Booker T were booked into a mixed tag team match against Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks and won after she rolled-up Ms. Brooks. After the match, Roode was arguing with Ms. Brooks when Sharmell came back to stop Roode only to get hit in the face and kayfabe breaking her jaw. She made her return at Destination X, after the Booker T and Roode match, whipping Payton Banks and Roode. On April 13 at Lockdown, she and husband, Booker T defeated Robert Roode and Payton Banks.\n\nSharmell was inactive following Booker's heel turn, but returned at Victory Road during the main event between Samoa Joe and her husband. She established herself as a heel during the match by making the three-count, allowing her husband to \"win\" the TNA World Championship. When Booker joined The Main Event Mafia in October 2008, Sharmell followed suit. On the November 20th edition of iMPACT!, Sharmell was challenged to a match with ODB at Final Resolution, which she accepted. Along with The Beautiful People, Sharmell fell to the team of ODB, Taylor Wilde, and Roxxi at Final Resolution. Sharmell was regularly seen bickering with fellow Mafia valet Jenna Morasca, leading to a catfight backstage on the May 28th edition of Impact! which led to Sharmell challenging Morasca to a match at Victory Road 2009. She lost the match after Kong knocked her out then Morasca pinned her. She then competed in the TNA Knockout Tag Title tournament teaming with Traci Brooks to represent The Main Event Mafia, but they lost in the first round of the tournament to Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed. At Bound for Glory Booker and Sharmell made their final appearance for TNA, before leaving the company.\n\nDuring the week of November 5, 2007, she appeared on five episodes of \"Family Feud\" with Batista, Candice Michelle, Booker T, Mr. Kennedy, Layla El, Michelle McCool, Maria, Ric Flair, and Jonathan Coachman.\n\nSullivan has a stepson Brandon, from Huffman's first marriage. She and Huffman began dating while they both worked for WCW. The couple were married in February 2005. Sullivan gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, on August 5, 2010.\n\n\n"}

The NBA announced that 49 college and high school players and 11 international players had filed as early-entry candidates for the draft.\n\nThis was the last NBA draft for which high school players were eligible. The new collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players union established a new age limit for draft eligibility.

International players, defined in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement as non-US nationals who did not complete athletic eligibility at a U.S. high school, must turn 19 (or older) in the calendar year of the draft, up from 18.

The family acquired great influence and wealth in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the 16th century.\n\nThe first confirmed records of the Sapieha family date back to the 15th century, when Semen Sopiha () was mentioned as a writer (scribe) of the then King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV Jagiellon () for the period of 1441–49. Semen had two sons, Bohdan and Iwan.\n\nPossibly, the family of Semen Sopiha owned the village of Sopieszyno near Gdansk, which they left because of the Teutonic invasion. Sopieszyno is one of the oldest Pomeranian villages. The records have it that already in the 11th-12th centuries it was a knightly estate. It was then mentioned in 1399 as a village owned in fiefdom by knights subject to the Polish Crown. Their family could be involved in the Baltic-Volga trade, as many Pomeranian families. It is archeologically evident that the Western Dvina was part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Arabs. Their family's appearance near Smolensk corresponds to that. \n\nThe creator of the fortune and power of the Sapieha family was the Court and Great Chancellor and Great Hetman of Lithuania, Lew Sapieha.\n\nThe princely title of the Sapieha-Kodenski branch was recognized in Poland in 1572 and in Austria-Hungary in 1845, while that of the Sapieha-Rozanski line was officially acknowledged in Russia in 1880. \n\nOn 14 September 1700, Michał Franciszek Sapieha had obtained the title of prince from Emperor Leopold I, but the title became extinct upon his death on 19 November 1700. That year, the family lost its dominant position in the Grand Duchy as a result of its defeat in the Lithuanian Civil War. In 1768, members of the Sapieha family obtained recognition of the princely title from the Polish Sejm. After the partitions of Poland, the family appeared in the list of persons authorised to bear the title of Prince of the Kingdom of Poland in 1824. The title was recognised in Austria in 1836 and 1840, and in Russia in 1874 and 1901. In 1905, the family obtained the qualification of Serene Highness in Austria.\n\nThe maternal grandmother of Queen Mathilde of Belgium was a member of the house of Sapieha.\n\nThe Sapieha family used the Polish coat of arms named \"Lis\".\n\nChancellor, marshal of the Lithuanian Tribunal\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1890951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890951", "title": "Cleavage (breasts)", "text": "Cleavage (breasts)\n\nCleavage is the exposed area between a woman's breasts lying over the sternum, and refers \"only\" to what is visible with clothing (or dense, nontransparent body art) that includes a low-cut neckline. In some cultures, display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and may be associated with garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as ball gowns, evening gowns, lingerie, and swimwear. In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their physical attractiveness and femininity, within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific norms of modesty of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally taboo (e.g. \"juyub\" in Islam), illegal or otherwise socially disapproved of.\n\nThe anatomical term for the area that constitutes a cleavage is intermammary cleft, intermammary sulcus or sulcus intermammarius.\n\nDécolletage is the upper part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.\n\nWhen the side of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as \"side cleavage\" (a dubious construction, since cleavage is not involved since the intermammary cleft is not what is shown), \"sidewinders\" or \"sideboob\". In early 2010s side cleavage was identified as a fashion trend. Gabriele Hackworthy, fashion director at \"Harper's Bazaar\", said, \"The look is unlikely to fade fast, with Yves Saint Laurent and Roberto Cavalli both pushing the silhouette next season.\"\n\nWhen the lower part of the breasts is uncovered, it is called \"underboob\".\n\nMany people in Western culture, both male and female, consider breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic and an important aspect of femininity. Décolletage that exposes cleavage is used by many women to enhance their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become fixated on breast shape and cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.\n\nIn Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public. In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by dress codes in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of nipples or areolae is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as lewd or indecent behavior. Art historian James Laver argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.\n\nThere is historical evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or any hint of a bosom. Early English Puritans used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century Spaniards put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.\n\nMuslims refer to the Quran where it is stated, \"Let them draw their Khimar (shawl/head veil) over their \"juyub\" (breast-line/cleavage)\". The \"ayat\" refers to the women's clothes worn, parted in the front to expose the breasts, at the time when it was cited. It was later interpreted as total covering of a woman's body. In early 21st century Muslim world there are differences in legal implementation. In Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, women are required to cover their body and face completely, Iranian law requires a chador (over-cloak) or a hijab (head scarf). In Egypt, the exposure of cleavage in the media is considered to be nudity.\n\nThe cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock cleavages, sharing a similarity between their appearances, are considered sexual in some cultures. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during ovulation, allowed females to \"solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile\", though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations. According to social historian David Kunzle, waist confinement and décolletage are the primary sexualization devices of Western costume. By the turn of the 21st century, some of the attention given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks, especially in the media.\n\nIn 2600 BCE, princess Nofret of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt was depicted in a V-neck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE, Snake Goddess figurines were sculpted in Minos with open dress-fronts, revealing entire breasts. Ancient Greek goddess Hera wore an early version of a push-up bra, described in the \"Iliad\" as festooned with \"brooches of gold\" and \"a hundred tassels\", to increase her cleavage to divert Zeus from the Trojan War.\n\nDécolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late Middle Ages. This continued through the Victorian period. Gowns that exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.\n\nIn the 14th century, necklines were lowered, clothes were tightened and breasts were once again flaunted. In 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the French court. Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c.1480.\n\nIn many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts. In aristocratic and upper-class circles the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol, as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position. The bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of classical Greece that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period. After the French Revolution décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back.\n\nDuring the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. Anne of Brittany has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts. During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. Anne of Austria was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight bodice and corsets that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the areola and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.\n\nDuring the Victorian period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see 1880s in fashion).\n\nDuring the French Enlightenment, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy's 1771 play \"The True Mother\" (\"La Vraie Mère\"), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: \"Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?\" Nearly a century later, also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at the Tuileries in Paris in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: \"I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!\"\n\nIn 1884 \"Portrait of Madame X\", a portrait painting by John Singer Sargent of American-born Paris socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, was criticized for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884. In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a \"bust form\" was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.\n\nClergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the German Empire, for example, all Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions. Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies during World War I and remained so for nearly half a century.\n\nA 1946 Time Magazine article titled \"Cleavage & the Code\" discussed the new meaning to the word cleavage as viewed by Joseph Breen of the Production Code Administration (PCA). Previously the PCA had applied the word decolletage, such as in the film \"The Outlaw\" (1941), starring Jane Russell. The article referenced the PCA´s decision to refuse a certificate for the US release of the British film \"The Wicked Lady\" (1945), starring Margaret Lockwood and Patricia Roc, as the women's dress bodices (appropriate for the era portrayed) were perceived to be very low-cut and showed too much cleavage, thereby violating the Hays Purity Code. As a result of the objections by Breen and the PCA, extensive reshooting was required with the actresses' cleavages covered before the film could be released in the US. The Time article also references further usages on the word cleavage by the PCA on other British films, \"Bedelia\" (also starring Margaret Lockwood) (1946) and \"Pink String and Sealing Wax\" (1945) (starring Googie Withers).\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood film \"The French Line\" was found objectionable under the Hays Code because of Jane Russell's \"breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure\" while some of her décollete gowns were thought \"...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage.\" But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, Gina Lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and falsies). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty.\n\nFrom the 1960s onward, however, changes in fashions were towards increasing displays of cleavage in films and television, with Jane Russell and Elizabeth Taylor being the biggest stars who led the fashion, and in everyday life low-cut dress styles became very common, even for casual wear. The Wonderbra was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.\n\nThe ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of the 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of methods and techniques. In the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy, echoing the sci-fi look of the times; in the 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with Hippie chic of the times; and from the 1990s a buffed, pumped and engorged look has become the preference.\n\n21st century women's fashions, especially at formal occasions, has increasingly included low-cut dress designs which expose cleavage. Such dress designs have been most noticeable at various awards presentations, such as those seen at the 2016 Academy Awards. However, such low-cut dresses still attract comment, though less controversy. It was also noticeable in the 2013 film \"American Hustle\", as well as in films which expose cleavage in a low-cut bra or swimsuit.\n\nDisplay of cleavage can still be controversial. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, Southwest Airlines crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable. In Langley, British Columbia, a young woman was sent home from her high school for wearing a top that her principal deemed inappropriate because \"it showed too much cleavage.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel created controversy when she wore a low-cut evening gown to the opening of the Oslo Opera House in 2008; U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton and British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith drew attention for wearing low-cut blouses that revealed a small amount of cleavage, resulting in comments in the \"Washington Post\" and the \"New York Times.\" Vera Lengsfeld, the Conservative Christian Democratic Union candidate for Berlin's Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district, used pictures of herself and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in low-cut dresses during her political campaign. Facing a tough campaign, she posted 750 provocative campaign posters, accompanied by the slogan \"We Have More to Offer\" to draw attention to \"serious election issues.\" The posters had a positive impact.\n\nVarious methods have been used by women in history to enhance their physical attractiveness and femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place.\n\nCorsets that enhanced cleavage were introduced in the mid-16th century. By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward. The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.\n\nWhen corsets became unfashionable, brassieres and padding helped to project, display and emphasize the breasts. In 1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent for a \"breast supporter,\" described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern push-up bra designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits.\n\nDevelopment of the underwire bra started in the 1930s, though it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of World War II freed metal for domestic use. Aviator and filmmaker Howard Hughes designed a prototype for an aerodynamic underwire bra for Jane Russell when filming \"The Outlaw\" in 1941. According to Hughes, the resultant amount was \"the length of the actual cleavage is five and one-quarter inches.\" Several brassiere manufacturers, among them Wonderbra and Victoria's Secret, produce push-up and other types of bras that enhance cleavage. Frederick's of Hollywood introduced a design called Hollywood Extreme Cleavage Bra that helped give the impression of a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by stars like Pamela Anderson.\n\nMany women, such as beauty pageant participants and transgender people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling them together and up. Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of moleskin under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.\n\nBigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between them. Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking breast augmentation. Plastic surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, \"you can't have cleavage with an A cup. You have to be at least a B or a C.\" A similar statement was made for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie manufacturers Frederick's of Hollywood promises \"high-rise cleavage to small busts\" and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a B cup an \"exciting C cup cleavage\").\n\nBreast surgery for emplacing breast implants can be done for three purposes:\n\n\nFor breast reconstruction and for the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics — size, shape, and texture — of a woman's breasts, there are two types of breast implant devices in practice: saline implants filled with sterile saline solution and silicone implants filled with viscous silicone gel.\n\nIf a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the medial borders of the breasts, it could result in symmastia, a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the sternum, creating a lack of defined cleavage. Procedures are generally followed during breast reconstruction to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts.\n\nRegular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex, which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent droopiness and can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage. Weight training, use of exercise machines, push ups and chest presses are considered helpful, as well as a number of other exercises, including rowing and basketball.

{"id": "1890954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890954", "title": "Atonement (novel)", "text": "Atonement (novel)\n\nAtonement is a 2001 British metafiction novel written by Ian McEwan. Set in three time periods, 1935 England, Second World War England and France, and present-day England, it covers an upper-class girl's half-innocent mistake that ruins lives, her adulthood in the shadow of that mistake, and a reflection on the nature of writing.\n\nWidely regarded as one of McEwan's best works, it was shortlisted for the 2001 Booker Prize for fiction. In 2010, \"TIME\" magazine named \"Atonement\" in its list of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923.\n\nIn 2007, the book was adapted into a BAFTA and Academy Award-winning film of the same title, starring Saoirse Ronan, James McAvoy, and Keira Knightley, and directed by Joe Wright.\n\nBriony Tallis, a 13-year-old English girl with a talent for writing, lives at her family's country estate with her parents Jack and Emily Tallis. Her older sister Cecilia has recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with Robbie Turner, the Tallis family housekeeper's son and Cecilia's childhood friend (Robbie received a first in English while Cecilia received a \"humiliating third\"), with whom she eventually develops a relationship.\n\nIn the summer of 1935, Briony's maternal cousins, Lola and her twin brothers Jackson and Pierrot, visit the family after their parents are going through a bitter divorce. Briony's immaturity, and her inability to grasp certain situations which are beyond her understanding, lead her to misinterpret a scene she witnesses of a struggle between Robbie and Cecilia. What she believes to be a moment of sexual tension between Cecilia and Robbie is far from the reality of the situation and is the spark that begins Briony's fantasies. Briony misconstrues this situation and concludes that Robbie is acting aggressively toward Cecilia, due to their differences in gender and Briony's idea of male dominance over women.\n\nRobbie, meanwhile, begins to realise he has developed an attraction towards Cecilia, whom he has not seen in some time, and writes several drafts of a love letter to her expressing the feelings he has for her. He decides to give the letter to Briony to deliver to Cecilia for him; however, he inadvertently gives her a version he had meant to discard, which contains lewd and vulgar references (\"In my dreams I kiss your cunt\"). It becomes too late for Robbie to rectify his mistake and despite his instructions to Briony not to open the letter she disobeys him and reads what he had initially written to Cecilia. Being a child, she most certainly had not seen such language written and interprets it as being a threat from Robbie to her sister Cecilia.\n\nLater on that same evening, she walks in on Robbie and Cecilia making love in the library. Again Briony misinterprets the sexual act as rape and believes Robbie is a \"maniac\". What Briony fails to understand is that upon her entrance into the library, she has crushed Robbie and Cecilia's only moment of love and labels Robbie as a rapist, which again is far from the truth. Her interpretation of their love leads her to believe that she needs to protect her sister from Robbie.\n\nLater, there is a family dinner party attended by Briony's brother Leon and his friend Paul Marshall, who appears to have a lengthy scratch on his face. Moments later it is discovered that the twins have run away. The dinner party breaks into teams to search for them.\n\nIn the darkness, whilst everyone is searching for the twins, Briony discovers her cousin Lola being raped by an assailant she cannot clearly see. Lola is unable or perhaps unwilling to identify the attacker — strongly hinted to be Marshall — but Briony decides to accuse Robbie and identifies him to the police as the rapist, claiming she has seen Robbie's face in the dark. Her previous misinterpretations of seeing Robbie and Cecilia's struggle at the fountain, the letter, and the scene she witnesses in the library, lead Briony to accuse Robbie of raping Lola, despite having no solid proof that he was responsible. Robbie is taken away to prison, with only Cecilia and his mother believing his protestations of innocence. Briony perceives her actions to be heroic, fulfilling her fantasies of the criminal being locked up, yet she is unaware of the impact her implications had. As a result of this, Cecilia cuts off her family and refuses to speak to them again.\n\nBy the time Second World War has started, Robbie has spent several years in prison. He is released on the condition he enlists in the army.\n\nCecilia has trained and become a nurse. She has cut off all contact with her family because of the part they took in sending Robbie to jail.\n\nRobbie and Cecilia have only been in contact by letter, since she was not allowed to visit him in prison. Before Robbie has to go to war in France, they meet once for half an hour, during Cecilia's lunch break. Their reunion starts awkwardly, but they share a kiss before leaving each other.\n\nIn France, the war is going badly, and the army is retreating to Dunkirk. As the injured Robbie goes to that safe haven, he thinks about Cecilia and past events like teaching Briony how to swim, reflecting on Briony's possible reasons for accusing him.\n\nHis single meeting with Cecilia is the memory that keeps him walking; his only aim is seeing her again. His condition deteriorates over the course of the section: He weakens and becomes delirious, and the text strongly implies that he is dying of his wound. At the end of part two, Robbie falls asleep in Dunkirk, one day before the evacuation begins.\n\nRemorseful Briony has refused her place at Cambridge and instead is a trainee nurse in London. She has realised the full extent of her mistake and decides it was Paul Marshall, Leon's friend, whom she saw raping Lola. Briony still writes, although she does not pursue it with the same recklessness as she did as a child.\n\nBriony is called to the bedside of Luc, a young, fatally wounded French soldier. She consoles him in his last moments by speaking with him in her school French, and he mistakes her for an English girl whom his mother wanted him to marry.\n\nJust before his death, Luc asks, \"Do you love me?\" Briony replies, \"Yes,\" not only because \"no other answer was possible\" but also because \"for the moment, she did. He was a lovely boy far away from his family and about to die.\" Afterward, Briony daydreams about the life she might have had if she had married Luc and gone to live with him and his family.\n\nBriony attends the wedding of Paul Marshall and her cousin Lola — who has decided to marry her rapist — before finally visiting Cecilia. Robbie is on leave from the army, and Briony meets him unexpectedly at her sister's.\n\nCecilia and Robbie both refuse to forgive Briony, who nonetheless tells them she will try to put things right. She promises to begin the legal procedures needed to exonerate Robbie, even though Paul Marshall will never be held responsible for his crime because of his marriage to Lola, the victim.\n\nThe final section, titled \"London 1999,\" is narrated by Briony herself in the form of a diary entry. Now 77, she is a successful novelist who has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia, so she is facing rapid mental decline and death.\n\nThe reader learns that Briony is the author of the preceding sections of the novel. On the penultimate page, Briony reveals that Robbie Turner died of septicaemia — caused by his injury — on the beaches of Dunkirk, that Cecilia was killed during the same year that a bomb that destroyed Balham Underground station, and Briony never saw them in 1940. Briony did attend Lola's wedding to Marshall, but confesses she was too \"cowardly\" to visit the \"recently bereaved\" Cecilia to make amends. The novel — which she says is factually true apart from Robbie and Cecilia being reunited — is her lifelong attempt at \"atonement\" for what she did to them. \n\nBriony justifies her invented happy ending by saying she does not see what purpose it would serve to give readers a \"pitiless\" story. She writes, \"I like to think that it isn't weakness or evasion, but a final act of kindness, a stand against oblivion and despair, to let my lovers live and to unite them at the end.\"\n\n\n\"Atonement\" contains intertextual references to a number of other literary works, including \"Gray's Anatomy\", Virginia Woolf's \"The Waves\", Thomas Hardy's \"Jude the Obscure\", Henry James' \"The Golden Bowl\", Jane Austen's \"Northanger Abbey\", Samuel Richardson's \"Clarissa\", Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\", Rosamond Lehmann's \"Dusty Answer\", and Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet,\" and \"Twelfth Night\". McEwan has also said that he was directly influenced by L.P. Hartley's \"The Go-Between\".\n\n\"Atonement\" contains a (fictional) letter addressed to Briony by the literary critic and editor Cyril Connolly. Like Connolly, Elizabeth Bowen is revealed to have reviewed Briony's earlier novel.\n\n\"Atonement\" was shortlisted for the 2001 Booker Prize for fiction. It was also shortlisted for the 2001 James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the 2001 Whitbread Novel Award. It won the 2002 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction, the 2002 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, the 2002 WH Smith Literary Award, the 2002 Boeke Prize and the 2004 Santiago Prize for the European Novel. In its 1000th issue, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named the novel #82 on its list of the 100 best books from 1983–2008. Additionally, \"Time\" named it the best fiction novel of the year and included it in its \"All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels\". \"The Observer\" cites it as one of the 100 greatest novels ever written, calling it \"a contemporary classic of mesmerising narrative conviction.\" In 2019, the novel was ranked 41st on \"The Guardian\"'s list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.\n\nLiterary critiques:\n\n\nIn late 2006, romance and historical author Lucilla Andrews said that McEwan had failed to give her sufficient credit for material on wartime nursing in London sourced from her 1977 autobiography \"No Time for Romance\". McEwan professed innocence of plagiarism while acknowledging his debt to the author. McEwan had included Andrews among the acknowledgements in the book, and several authors defended him, including John Updike, Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Thomas Keneally, Zadie Smith, and the reclusive Thomas Pynchon.\n\nA film adaptation, directed by Joe Wright from a screenplay by Christopher Hampton, was released by Working Title Films in September 2007 in the United Kingdom and in December 2007 in the United States.\n\n\n"}

It is both a summer and a winter tourist resort.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, the former municipalities of Calfreisen, Castiel, Langwies, Lüen, Molinis, Peist and St. Peter-Pagig merged into the municipality of Arosa.\n\nAt the end of 2013 the Arosa ski resort was linked with Lenzerheide by cable-car, creating the new ski resort of Arosa Lenzerheide. Since then transport passes work in both resorts.\n\nThe official language of Arosa is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.\n\nThe resort is known throughout Switzerland for its famous ice hockey team, the EHC Arosa which used to be one of the most successful teams in the country.\n\nArosa is first mentioned about 1330 as \"Araus\". In 1383 it was mentioned as \"Orossen\" and in 1428 it was first mentioned as \"Arosa\".\n\nThe first known settlements are from the 13th century. After 1300 Arosa German-speaking Walser settlers came from Davos and replaced the original Romansh-speaking inhabitants. During the following centuries, the village had a subsistence alpine pasture economy. Until 1851 it was politically a part of the Davos municipality. Arosa was established as a health resort by a German doctor in 1883, and the first sanatorium was opened in 1888. From 1900 on it gradually developed as a winter resort. In 1938 the first ski lifts were built, and in 1956 the Weisshorn cable car was opened and further rope and chair lifts followed.\n\nIn 1851 Arosa separated from the municipality of Davos.\n\nSkiing in Switzerland received a big boost from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes series. Conan Doyle, an avid sportsman, was wintering in Davos. For entertainment, he ordered some skiing \"boards\" from Norway and hiked up the mountain with two local guides. They then skied down into Arosa, ending their journey with a luncheon at a local inn, the Seehof, the first hotel in Arosa. Conan Doyle wrote of his pioneering Davos/Arosa ski adventure in a British magazine, \"The Strand\", in 1894, and the story attracted British skiers to Switzerland.\n\nErwin Schrödinger was vacationing in Arosa at Christmas 1925 when he made his breakthrough discovery of wave mechanics.\n\nIn 1933, Thomas Mann stayed in Arosa during the first week of his Swiss exile.\n\nThe 1939 film \"Over the Moon\" (shot 1937-9) has brief Technicolor exterior shots of the train station and ski resort areas.\n\nOn 20 February 1940, Germany's Hassall met with British J. Lonsdale Bryant in Arosa, to make a plan to overthrow the ruling German Nazi Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe municipality of Arosa has an area of . Of this, 42% is used for agriculture, and 15.2% is forested. 3.1% is settled (buildings and roads) and the remainder (39.7%) includes the rivers, glaciers and mountains which attract tourists which constitute the primary industry.\n\nBefore 2017, the municipality was in the Schanfigg sub-district of the Plessur district, after that date it was part of the Plessur Region. Located on the south-east slope of the Weisshorn chain, the town of Arosa is at the top of the Schanfigg valley at the foot of the Aroser Weisshorn (). Adjoining are the areas of Innerarosa, Dorf-Obersee, Untersee and Maran-Prätschli at an elevation of .\n\nThe two lakes in the centre of Arosa are the Obersee (upper lake) and Untersee. The town's railway station is at the end of a branch line from Chur.\n\nArosa has a well-known and safe skiing area and boasts over of slopes.\n\nThe main industry is tourism: there are 4287 guest beds. Arosa has an unemployment rate of 1.32%. , there were only 4 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 2 businesses involved in this sector. 308 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 30 businesses in this sector. 1,202 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 185 businesses in this sector.\n\nArosa has a year-round population (as of ) of . , 22.0% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has decreased by 9.8%, but fluctuates seasonally from about 4600 in January to about 2500 in May. Most of the population () speak German (79.8%), with Portuguese being second most common language (7.3%) and Italian third (4.1%).\n\n, there were 51.1% males and 48.9% females. The age distribution, , in Arosa is: 7.0% between 0 and 9 years old; 3.2% are 10 to 14; 4.5% are 15 to 19. 26.2% are between 20 and 29 years old. 18.0% are 30 to 39, 14.5% are 40 to 49, 11.6% are 50 to 59. 7.0% are between 60 and 69 years old, 4.9% are 70 to 79, 2.3% are 80 to 89, and 0.6% are 90 to 99.\n\nIn the 2007 federal election the most popular party was the SVP which received 45% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the FDP (24.7%), the SP (17%) and the CVP (12%).\n\nIn Arosa about 70.3% of the population between age 25-64 have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a \"Fachhochschule\").\n\nFrom the , 1,140 or 41.1% are Roman Catholic, while 1,150 or 41.5% belonged to the Swiss Reformed Church. 109 individuals (or about 3.9% of the population) belong to the Orthodox Church, and 17 individuals (about 0.6% of the population) who belong to another Christian church.

Unlike the original Usenet, it was peered only between \"sound sites\" and employed a system of rules to keep out spam. \n\nUsenet II was backed by influential Usenetters like Russ Allbery. \n\nSometime between 2010 and 2011, the web page for Usenet II went offline.\n\nThe newsgroup hierarchy in Usenet II revived the old naming system used by Usenet before the Great Renaming. All groups had names starting \"net.\", which serve to distinguish them from the \"Big 8\" (misc.*, sci.*, news.*, rec.*, soc.*, talk.*, comp.*, humanities.*). A separate checkgroup system, using the same technical mechanism as the one produced by David C. Lawrence for the Big 8, enforced the Usenet II hierarchy and prevents the creation of unauthorized newsgroups within it.\n\nThe basic principles of operation were controlled by a \"Steering Committee\", which appointed \"hierarchy czars\" who were responsible for the content of specific portions of the namespace, or hierarchies.\n\nUsenet II had strictly enforced rules. Readers of messages in Usenet II had to be fully compliant with the RFC 1036 (Usenet) standard plus some additional format compliance rules that were specific to Usenet II. A message header had to contain a valid email address in the From field. It was required to have an NNTP-Posting-Host header field containing a sound site. The distribution field was to be set to \"4gh\" (a reference to \"Shockwave Rider\" by John Brunner). If the Subject field started with \"Re:\", indicating a follow-up, there had to be a valid \"References\" field that contained the Message-ID of a previous message. Crossposts to groups outside the net.* hierarchy were cancelled automatically.\n\nNo message were allowed to spawn a discussion in more than three newsgroups.

She was born during a failed saline abortion attempt. The 2011 film \"October Baby\" was loosely based on Jessen's life.\n\nJessen was born April 6, 1977 in Los Angeles, California. Her medical records indicate that she was born in the 30th week of pregnancy to a 17-year-old girl during a failed saline abortion. Jessen's birth certificate is signed by the doctor who was performing the abortion.\n\nJessen weighed at birth, and was born with cerebral palsy, a motor condition that affects various areas of body movement, which she says was caused by the abortion attempt. She describes it as a \"tremendous gift\". Jessen spent three months in the hospital before being placed in foster care. She was adopted at the age of four.\n\nJessen's career as an activist began in 1991, when she was 14, after her adoptive mother, Diana DePaul, told Jessen she was born to a 17-year-old girl, during a failed abortion attempt. Jessen has since campaigned against abortion, saying \"It's more comfortable for people to think of abortion as a political decision, or a right. But I am not a right. I am a human being\". Jessen said she's forgiven her birth mother, but is not interested in a relationship with her, citing a strong relationship with her adoptive mother. Jessen has also campaigned against exceptions to late-term abortion laws, on the grounds of fetal disability, citing her own disability. Jessen appeared on the Maury Povich Show with her adoptive mother in 1991. In reporting her story and publicizing Jessen's early life to the nation, \"The New York Times\" observed that Jessen and Becky Bell, a teenage girl who reportedly died as a result of a botched unsafe abortion in 1988, had become the symbols of America's debate over abortion and characterized them as \"poster girls whose stories are being shrewdly marketed by their supporters to keep passions high.\" Jessen is a stage name that was adopted when she began her activism.\n\nIn 1995, four years after Jessen was placed in the national spotlight, author Jessica Shaver published a biography on Jessen. In early 1996, Festival of Light Australia sponsored an Australian tour, during which Jessen spoke at venues in all states and territories.\n\nIn his speech at the 2002 signing of the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act President George W. Bush mentioned Jessen, acknowledging her presence and extending his appreciation.\n\nIn December 2005 Jessen travelled to London to support a campaign to reduce the number of abortions under the UK Abortion Act and to speak at a parliamentary meeting at the House of Commons. Both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of Westminster indicated that they hoped her story would encourage Parliament to look again at abortion.\n\nOn May 8, 2006, the Colorado State House of Representatives considered a resolution honoring the 90th anniversary of a local branch of Planned Parenthood. Republican representative Ted Harvey invited Jessen to sing the national anthem to the House that day and then told her story \"because, 'I just wanted to put a face to this celebration'.\" \n\nIn September 2008, Jessen was in Canberra, Australia, sponsored by the Australian Christian Lobby, to lobby federal politicians on late term abortions. The same month, Jessen appeared in a political advertisement during the 2008 US presidential campaign stating, \"if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here\", referring to Obama's opposition to \"born alive\" legislation.\n\nIn September 2015, Jessen testified at a Congressional hearing investigating Planned Parenthood's practices regarding fetal tissue donation, following the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy. During her testimony, Jessen said she would ask Planned Parenthood the following question: \"If abortion is about women’s rights, then what were mine?\"\n\n\n"}

They are the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary. According to convention, when the Prime Minister names his or her Cabinet, either after a general election or a mid-term reshuffle, the first Cabinet ministers to be announced are the Chancellor, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary.\n\nThe Great Offices of State are derived from the most senior positions in the Royal Household – the Great Officers of State. These eventually became hereditary and honorary titles, while the substantive duties of the Officers passed to individuals who were appointed on behalf of the Crown. The medieval origins of the Chancellorship of the Exchequer make it the oldest surviving Great Office of State, while the position of Secretary of State came into being in the late 16th century and the office of Prime Minister evolved gradually in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nJames Callaghan is the only person to date to have served in all four positions. In the past hundred years, several other people have come close to achieving this distinction: H. H. Asquith and Winston Churchill both served as Chancellor, Prime Minister and Home Secretary while Harold Macmillan and John Major served as Prime Minister, Chancellor and Foreign Secretary. Rab Butler and Sir John Simon served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary and Home Secretary. Two of the Great Offices of State have often been held simultaneously by one person, most recently by Ramsay MacDonald, Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary in 1924; the Duke of Wellington is the only person to have held three of the Great Offices simultaneously, serving as Prime Minister, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary in the Wellington caretaker ministry.\n\nOwing to the political constitution of the United Kingdom, in which the House of Commons retains most of the power, it is accepted that it is no longer practical for holders of the Great Offices of State to be members of the House of Lords. The House of Lords has traditionally been restrained in the passage of financial bills, meaning that the office of Chancellor is effectively limited to the House of Commons. The last holders of the other positions to have been peers were:\n\n\nIt is most exceptional that a holder of a Great Office of State should not hold a seat in Parliament at all, neither in the Commons nor in the Lords. It occurred briefly in 1963, when Alec Douglas-Home was appointed Prime Minister: he disclaimed his peerage on 23 October, and was not returned to the Commons until a by-election on 7 November. More substantially, Patrick Gordon Walker was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1964 despite not holding a Parliamentary seat, having been defeated in his Smethwick constituency seat in the 1964 general election; he held the post for three months until his resignation in January 1965.\n\nSix women have held one or more Great Offices of State, with four of the six being members of the Conservative Party. Out of the four Offices, three have been held by women; Chancellor of the Exchequer is the only position that has not. Due to her ascension to the office of Prime Minister in July 2016, Theresa May became the first woman to hold two different Great Offices of State, with the appointment of Amber Rudd as Home Secretary resulting in the first period in which more than one of the Offices were held by women simultaneously.\n\nPrime Minister:\n\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer:\n\nNo woman has yet served as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nForeign Secretary:\n\n\nHome Secretary: \n\n\nBenjamin Disraeli became the first person of an ethnic minority to attain one of the Great Offices of State when he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1852. Following the resignation of The Earl of Derby in 1868, he also became the first and to date the only person of Jewish heritage to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Malcolm Rifkind and David Miliband later held the position of Foreign Secretary, with Michael Howard and Leon Brittan serving as Home Secretary and Nigel Lawson as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nAfter Amber Rudd's resignation following the Windrush scandal, Sajid Javid became the first person of Pakistani descent to hold a Great Office of State as Home Secretary and later Chancellor of the Exchequer. Priti Patel was appointed as Home Secretary by Boris Johnson, becoming the first woman of ethnic minority to take the position. After her appointment, three ethnic minority ministers held positions of the Great Offices of State simultaneously for the first time.\n\nPrime Minister:\n\n\n\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Secretary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Secretary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1991, the FCSAA has been the sole sponsor of the Brain Bowl.\n\nAfter initially gaining the approval and support of the Florida Community College Council of Presidents, the fall of 1981 was spent developing rules and organizing regional competitions. The cash awards for the initial year came from a combination of funds from the legislative appropriation that established the Program to Recognize Initiative and Distinction in Education (PRIDE) and more than $12,000 that the founders of the Brain Bowl competition were able to raise from private sources.\n\nSince its inception in 1981, the Florida Community Colleges Brain Bowl competition has involved more than 1,000 students in regional and state competitions.

Walker\n\nSir John Ernest Walker (born 7 January 1941) is a British chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997. Walker is Emeritus Director and Professor at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit in Cambridge, and a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.\n\nWalker was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Ernest Walker, a stonemason, and Elsie Lawton, an amateur musician. He was brought up with his two younger sisters (Judith and Gen) in a rural environment and went to Rastrick Grammar School. At school, he was a keen sportsman and specialized in physical sciences and mathematics during his final three years there. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry from St Catherine's College, Oxford. Walker began his study of peptide antibiotics with Edward Abraham at Oxford in 1965 and received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1969. During this period, he became interested in developments in molecular biology.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1971, Walker worked at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and from 1971–1974 in France. He met Fred Sanger in 1974 at a workshop at the University of Cambridge. This resulted in an invitation to work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council, which became a long-term appointment. Among the other staff was Francis Crick, who was well known for his discovery of the molecular structure of DNA. At first, he analyzed the sequences of proteins and then uncovered details of the modified genetic code in mitochondria. In 1978, he decided to apply protein chemical methods to membrane proteins. In this way, Walker characterized the subunit composition of proteins in the mitochondrial membrane and the DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome.\n\nHis landmark crystallographic studies of the F1-ATPase, the catalytic region of the ATP synthase (done in collaboration with crystallographer Andrew Leslie), from bovine heart mitochondria revealed the three catalytic sites in three different conformations imposed by the position of the asymmetric central stalk. This structure supported the binding change mechanism and rotary catalysis for the ATP synthase (and related enzymes), one of the catalytic mechanisms proposed by Paul Boyer. This work, published in 1994, led to Walker's share of the 1997 Nobel prize for chemistry. Since this structure, Walker and his colleagues have produced most of the crystal structures in the PDB of mitochondrial ATP synthase, including transition state structures and protein with bound inhibitors and antibiotics. Scientists trained in Walker's group at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge or MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit have gone on to determine crystal bacterial complex I and cryo-EM maps of mitochondrial complex I and vacuolar type ATPases.\n\nStudents and postdoctoral research fellows who studied with John Walker who have gone on to independent research careers include:\nWalker was elected an EMBO Member in 1984. He shared his Nobel Prize with the American chemist Paul D. Boyer for their elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism underlying the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. They also shared the prize with Danish chemist Jens C. Skou for research unrelated to theirs (Discovery of the Na+/K+-ATPase). Sir John was knighted in 1999 for services to molecular biology. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1995. Walker is also a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences and an Honorary Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. In 2012 he was awarded the Copley Medal.\n\nWalker married Christina Westcott in 1963, and has two daughters.\n"}
{"id": "1891000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891000", "title": "Punk pathetique", "text": "Punk pathetique\n\nPunk pathetique is a subgenre of British punk rock (principally active circa 1980–1982) that involved humour and working-class cultural themes.\n\nThe name of the genre was coined by \"Sounds\" journalist Garry Bushell, who actively championed many of its exponents. Punk pathetique was initially an attempt to characterize a group of London bands that embodied Cockney culture with a Dickensian working class attitude. Musically, it was related to (and had crossover with) the Oi! subgenre. The cover of the 1980 Bushell/\"Sounds\" compilation album \"Oi the Album\" described the record as featuring \"ruck 'n' rollers and punk pathetiques\". In contrast to harder-edged Oi! bands with more serious lyrics, punk pathetique bands focused on the naughty, silly and trivial. Max Splodge of Splodgenessabounds said: \"The pathetique bands are the other side of Oi! We're working class too, only whereas some bands sing about prison and the dole, we sing about pilchards and bums. The audience is the same\".\n\nSome punk pathetique bands had notable success in the UK charts. Toy Dolls reached No. 4 in December 1984 with \"Nellie the Elephant\". Splodgenessabounds reached No. 7 in 1980 with \"Simon Templar,\" and No. 26 with \"Two Little Boys\" later that year. According to Bushell:\nPeter and the Test Tube Babies were first featured in \"Sounds\" in July 1980, and made their vinyl debut on \"Oi! the Album\" later that year. They favoured absurd lyrics and strange titles, such as \"The Queen Gives Good Blow Jobs\" and \"Elvis Is Dead (He Was 42 and a Fat Cunt)\". Toy Dolls, based in Sunderland, shared the punk pathetique approach to nonsensical entertainment. Toy Dolls singer Michael \"Olga\" Algar told \"Sounds\" in March 1980: \"We're a new wave group, but we're not serious. All our songs are pretty childish and infantile, but they're all based on things and people 'round here\".\n\nBushell wrote that punk pathetique peaked in autumn 1980, with the \"Pathetique Convention\" staged at the Electric Ballroom. However, music critic Dave Thompson has said, regarding Splodgenessabounds' 1981 album:\nOther punk pathetique bands included Television Personalities, Half Man Half Biscuit, the Shapes, the Adicts, Notsensibles, the Gonads, the Postmen, Desert Island Joe, the Hoopers, Pierre the Poet (Garry Butterfield), Paul Devine, Lord Waistrel & the Cosh Boys, Stephen Louis Knoche Jr & His Raging Cronies, the Alaska Cowboys, Percy Throwers Man Eating Plans, SexyCows, and the Orgasm Guerrillas. Later, the mantle was inherited by the Bus Station Loonies, Monkish and Macc Lads, who performed comic punk singalongs in very much the same style. Toy Dolls, Peter and the Test Tube Babies, the Gonads, and Splodgenessabounds continue to tour and record.\n\nIn Germany, the similar Fun-Punk genre emerged in the mid-1980s as a response to hardcore punk, which at that time was marked by political correctness and negative imagery. Fun-Punk often dealt with absurd themes or alcohol and drug excesses. An early pioneer was Normahl, later followed by Die Ärzte, Die Goldenen Zitronen and Wizo.\n"}
{"id": "1891001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891001", "title": "Pye Ltd.", "text": "Pye Ltd.\n\nPye Ltd was an electronics company founded in 1896 in Cambridge, England, as a manufacturer of scientific instruments. The company merged with EKCO in 1960. Philips of the Netherlands acquired a majority shareholding in 1967, and later gained full ownership.\n\nW.G. Pye & Co. Ltd. was founded in 1896 in Cambridge by William Pye, superintendent of the Cavendish Laboratory workshop, as a part-time business making scientific instruments. By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the company employed 40 people manufacturing instruments used for teaching and research. The war increased demand for such instruments and the War Office needed experimental thermionic valves. The manufacture of such components afforded the company the technical knowledge needed to develop the first wireless receiver when the first UK broadcasts were made by the British Broadcasting Company in 1922. Instruments continued to be designed and manufactured under W G Pye Ltd, later situated in York Street Cambridge, while a separate company was started to build wireless components in a factory to become known as Cambridge Works at Church Path, Chesterton.\n\nA series of receivers made at Church Path were given positive reviews by \"Popular Wireless\" magazine. In 1924, Harold Pye, the son of the founder, and Edward Appleton, his former tutor at St John's College, Cambridge, designed a new series of receivers which proved even more saleable. In 1928 William Pye sold the company, now renamed Pye Radio Limited, to C. O. Stanley, who established a chain of small component-manufacturing factories across East Anglia.\n\nWhen the BBC started to explore television broadcasting, Pye found that the closest of their East Anglian offices was 25 miles outside the estimated effective 25-mile radius of the Alexandra Palace transmitter. Stanley was fascinated by the new technology and on his instructions the company built a high gain receiver that could pick up these transmissions. In 1937, a five-inch Pye television receiver was priced at 21 guineas (£22.05) and within two years the company had sold 2,000 sets at an average price of £34 ().\n\nThe new EF50 valve from Philips enabled Pye to build this high-gain receiver, which was a Tuned Radio Frequency (TRF) type and not a superhet type. With the outbreak of World War II, the Pye receiver using EF50 valves became a key component of many radar receivers, forming the 45 MHz Intermediate Amplifier (IF) section of the equipment. Pye went on to design and manufacture radio equipment for the British Army, including Wireless Sets No. 10, 18, 19, 22, 62 and 68. Pye was also responsible for the early development work on the proximity fuze for anti-aircraft shells.\nIn February 1944, Pye formed a subsidiary called Pye Telecommunications Ltd, which it intended would design and produce radio communications equipment when the war ended. This company grew to become the leading UK producer of mobile radio equipment for commercial, business, industrial, police and government purposes. Popular products included the \"Reporter\", \"Cambridge\", and \"Westminster\" series of VHF radio transceivers. The company also produced the PF8 UHF hand-held radios featured in episodes of \"The Professionals\" television series.\n\nAfter the war, Pye's B16T nine-inch table television was designed around the 12-year-old EF50 valve. It was soon superseded by the B18T, which used an extra high tension (EHT) transformer developed by German companies before the war to produce the high voltage required by the cathode ray tube.\n\nIn 1955, the company diversified into music production with Pye Records. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) started public transmissions in the same year, so Pye produced new televisions that could receive ITV, and the availability of a second channel introduced the need for tuners. Pye's VT4 tunable television was launched in March 1954 and was followed by the V14. The V14 proved to be technically unreliable and so tarnished the Pye name that many dealers transferred their allegiance to other manufacturers. This failure so damaged corporate confidence that Pye avoided being first-to-market thereafter, although they developed the first British transistor in 1956.\nPye TVT Ltd was formed to produce broadcast television equipment, including cameras, which were popular with British broadcasters including the BBC as well as achieving international sales. The early cameras were called \"Photicon\" and the later models by their Mk number: 2, 3, etc. The Mk7/8 solid-state monochrome cameras were the last to be produced. The Pye Mk6 image orthicon camera, known as the PC60, was the last version supplied to BBC Outside Broadcasts in 1963 for a new fleet of eight outside broadcast vans. These cameras were the first generation of outside broadcast cameras to feature a zoom lens, rather than a turret system. These three-tubed cameras were known for their reliability but were so heavy and unwieldy that they required a stretcher to carry them around the OB site. The Pye PC60 was eventually replaced by the EMI 2001 on BBC outside broadcasts but, during its lifespan, it was used on numerous high-profile productions including Wimbledon tennis and Open golf.\n\nThe ITV companies purchased the popular Pye Mk3s, and to a lesser extent the Mk4s and Mk7s. Pye (TVT) never produced a colour broadcast television camera, but there was an abortive colour telecine camera; few if any were sold. The reason for this was probably the financial difficulties the company was in.\n\nIn 1960, Pye acquired the Telephone Manufacturing Company.\n\nNot wishing to risk further damage to their fragile brand, Pye first used transistors in a product sold as a subsidiary brand: the Pam 710 radio (1956), with the transistors themselves labelled Newmarket Transistors (another subsidiary). When this proved acceptable the company launched the Pye 123 radio (1957, still with the Newmarket label on the novel internal components). Products such as these reversed the decline but the arrival of Japanese competition reduced demand to a level that threatened the viability of the manufacturing plants. In 1960, Pye merged with its rival EKCO to form British Electronic Industries Ltd, with C.O. Stanley as Chairman and E.K. Cole as Vice-Chairman.\n\nThe company, like most of its domestic competitors, attempted to restore demand with price competition and, where viable production exceeded demand, sold excess stock at loss-making clearance prices. By 1966 Pye was in such difficulties that they started to reduce their manufacturing capacity with closure of the EKCO factory in Southend-on-Sea.\n\nPhilips attempted to buy out the ailing Pye in 1966. The Trade Secretary Anthony Wedgwood Benn determined that a complete sale would create a \"de facto\" monopoly so he permitted the transfer of only a 60% shareholding, with an undertaking that the Lowestoft factory would continue to manufacture televisions.\n\nOn 20 April 1964, BBC2 was launched, broadcasting entirely on the new television standard of 625-line UHF, but BBC1 and ITV would remain in 405-line VHF until 1969, when they began UHF broadcasting. During this transition, television receivers in the UK had to handle both the VHF and UHF wavebands, which added to the cost of producing the sets. The price of a dual-standard set, combined with the limited coverage of BBC2 and the highbrow programming on that channel, meant that initial sales of dual-standard sets were slow. The VHF system was finally switched off in the UK on 3 January 1985.\n\nPAL colour test signals began in 1966 and scheduled transmissions commenced on BBC2 on 1 July 1967, with a full colour service beginning on that channel on 2 December 1967. BBC1 and ITV followed suit on 15 November 1969. Colour broadcasting added further to the cost and complexity of producing television sets. The resulting high price and low coverage areas of the new technology delayed consumer adoption further: it wasn't until 1977 that the number of colour licences sold outnumbered those of black and white.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Sony and Hitachi launched UK colour televisions that cost less than £200. Domestic manufacturers attempted to compete, but were handicapped by outdated manufacturing techniques and an inflexible workforce. Pye found themselves with high stocks and low cash flow at a time when industrial relations were poor, the low-growth economy of the time and limited scope for reducing costs. The Pye group of companies was bought outright by Philips in 1976. The Lowestoft factory was subsequently sold to Sanyo and Philips moved the manufacture of Pye televisions to Singapore. Prior to the manufacturing offshoring, the company produced a range of televisions branded 'Pye Chelsea'. The range were teak-clad with stainless steel 'feet' and sported three large channel selectors. Whilst unsuitable for the reception of the forthcoming Channel 4, the equipment would operate through early video recorders, machines with larger channel capability. The Chelsea range were popular with TV rental companies such as Radio Rentals, Rumbelows and Wigfalls. Maintenance of these sets continued well into the 1980s, with the northern rental chain Wigfalls being the last to withdraw them in 1988.\n\nIn 1979 Pye were implicated in an episode of Granada's \"World in Action\" in relation to the sale of UHF and VHF radios as well as telephone intercept equipment which was used by the Ugandan Public Safety Unit, the secret police of Idi Amin's rule responsible for killing perhaps several hundred thousand Ugandans. Pye had been supplying Uganda through Wilken Telecommunications, its East Africa distributor.\n\nThe Pye brand enjoyed a short-lived renaissance in audio equipment (known as music centres) during the 1970s, and in the late 1980s with televisions, gaining something of a cult status among college students at the time. \n\nIn recent years the Pye brand has enjoyed a resurgence on the UK market , with domestic products including DVD recorders. The Pye brand is one of a handful surviving today from the early domestic electronics era that dates to before World War II.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1891017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891017", "title": "Alfred Stevens (painter)", "text": "Alfred Stevens (painter)\n\nAlfred Émile Léopold Stevens (11 May 182324 August 1906) was a Belgian painter, known for his paintings of elegant modern women.\n\nStevens was born in Brussels. He came from a family involved with the visual arts: his older brother Joseph (1816–1892) and his son Léopold (1866–1935) were painters, while another brother Arthur (1825–1899) was an art dealer and critic. His father, who had fought in the Napoleonic wars in the army of William I of the Netherlands, was an art collector who owned several watercolors by Eugène Delacroix, among other artists. His mother's parents ran Café de l'Amitié in Brussels, a meeting place for politicians, writers, and artists. All the Stevens children benefited from the people they met there, and the social skills they acquired in growing up around important people.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1837, Stevens left middle school to begin study at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, where he knew François Navez, the Neo-Classical painter and former student of Jacques-Louis David who was its director and an old friend of Stevens's grandfather. Following a traditional curriculum, he drew from casts of classical sculpture for the first two years, and then drew from live models. In 1843, Stevens went to Paris, joining his brother Joseph who already was there. He was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts, the most important art school in Paris. Although it is said that he became a student of its director Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, this is likely not true. An early picture by Stevens, \"The Pardon\" or \"Absolution\" (Hermitage, St. Petersburg), signed and dated 1849, shows his mastery of a conventional naturalistic style which owes much to 17th-century Dutch genre painting. Like the Belgian painter and friend with whom he stayed in Paris, Florent Joseph Marie Willems (1823–1905), Stevens carefully studied works by painters such as Gerard ter Borch and Gabriel Metsu.\n\nStevens's work was shown publicly for the first time in 1851, when three of his paintings were admitted to the Brussels Salon. He was awarded a third-class medal at the Paris Salon in 1853, and a second-class medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1855. His \"Ce qu'on appelle le vagabondage [What is called vagrancy]\" (Musée d'Orsay, Paris) attracted the attention of Napoleon III who, as a result of the scene in the picture, ordered that soldiers no longer be used to pick up the poor from the streets. Two other paintings he exhibited at the Salon in Antwerp that year, \"Chez soi\" or \"At Home\" (present location unknown) and \"The Painter and his Model\" (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore), introduced subjects from \"la vie moderne\" for which he became known: an elegant young woman in contemporary dress and the artist in his studio. In 1857, Stevens made his first important sale to a private collector, when \"Consolation\" was bought for a rumored 6,000 francs by the Berlin collector and dealer Ravéné. At the same time, he and his brother were becoming part of the art world of Paris, meeting people such as the Goncourt brothers, Théophile Gautier, and Alexandre Dumas at the salons of Princess Mathilde as well as popular cafés. In 1858, Stevens married Marie Blanc, who came from a rich Belgian family and old friends of the Stevens's. Eugène Delacroix was a witness at the ceremony.\n\nDuring the 1860s, Stevens became an immensely successful painter, known for his paintings of elegant modern women. His exhibits at the Salons in Paris and Brussels attracted favorable critical attention and buyers. An excellent example of his work during this time is \"La Dame en Rose\" or \"Woman in Pink\" (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels), painted in 1866, which combines a view of a fashionably dressed woman in an interior with a detailed examination of Japanese objects, a fashionable taste called \"japonisme\" of which Stevens was an early enthusiast. In 1863, he received the Legion of Honor (Chevalier) from the French government. In 1867, he won a first-class medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris, where he and Jan August Hendrik Leys were the stars of the Belgian section, and was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honor. His friends included Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Charles Baudelaire, Berthe Morisot, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Frédéric Bazille, and Puvis de Chavannes, and he was a regular in the group that gathered at the Café Guerbois in Paris.\n\nStevens fought for the French during the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War, but returned to Belgium with his wife and family before the Paris Commune. They returned after the war, and Stevens continued to achieve critical acclaim as well as great success with collectors. In 1875, he bought a grand house and garden in Paris on rue des Martyrs, which appeared in his paintings as well as those of other artists, including Édouard Manet's \"The Croquet Party\" (Städel Museum, Frankfurt am Main) from 1873. (He had to leave the house in 1880, however, to make way for the construction of a new street, which was named after him.) In 1878, he was made a Commander of the Legion of Honor and received another first-class medal at the Salon.\n\nDespite earning a considerable income through the sale of his paintings, Stevens found that a combination of bad investments and excessive spending caused him great financial difficulties during the 1880s. An additional expense came from summers by the sea, which a doctor told Stevens in 1880 were essential for his health. Thus the artist was glad to agree when the Paris dealer Georges Petit offered him 50,000 francs to finance his vacation in exchange for the paintings Stevens produced during that time. This deal, which lasted for three years, resulted in the sea becoming an important subject for him, and over the rest of his career, he painted hundreds of views of popular resorts along the Normandy coast and the Midi in the south. Many of them are painted in a sketchy style that shows the influence of the Impressionists. Stevens also began to take private students, including Sarah Bernhardt, who became a close personal friend, and William Merritt Chase. Other students were Berthe Art, Charles Bell Birch, Jules Cayron, Marie Collart-Henrotin, Louise De Hem, Harriet Campbell Foss, Georgette Meunier, Lilla Cabot Perry, Jean Paul Sinibaldi, and Fernand Toussaint.\n\nThe single most important work from the second half of Stevens's career is the monumental \"Panorama du Siècle, 1789–1889\", which he painted with Henri Gervex. Stevens painted the women and details and Gervex the men, with the help of fifteen assistants. It was shown to great acclaim at the International Exhibition held in Paris in 1889. He also received several great professional tributes. In 1895, a large exhibition of his work was held in Brussels. In 1900, Stevens was honored by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris with the first retrospective exhibition ever given to a living artist. Supported by patrons led by the Comtesse de Greffulhe, it achieved social cachet as well as popular success. In 1905, he was the only living artist allowed to exhibit in a retrospective show of Belgian art in Brussels. Despite these exhibitions, he was not able to sell enough of his work to manage well financially. Having outlived his brothers and most of his friends, he died in Paris in 1906, living alone in modest rooms.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the only head of government to plead guilty to genocide, in the first group of such convictions since the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide came into effect in 1951.\n\nKambanda holds a degree in commercial engineering and began his career as a low-level United Popular BPR banker, rising as a technocrat to become the chair of the bank. At the time of the April 1994 crisis he was vice president of the Butare section of the opposition Republican Democratic Movement (MDR).\n\nHe was sworn in as prime minister on April 9, 1994 after the president Juvénal Habyarimana and prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, were both assassinated. The opposition MDR had been promised the prime ministerial post in the transitional government established by the Arusha accords, but Kambanda leapfrogged several levels in the party's hierarchy to take the job from the initial choice, Faustin Twagiramungu. He remained in the post for the hundred days of the genocide until July 19, 1994. After leaving office he fled the country.\n\nKambanda was arrested in Nairobi on July 18, 1997, after a seven-week multinational stakeout and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The court accused him of distributing small arms and ammunition in Butare and Gitarama with the knowledge that they would be used to massacre civilians. He was found guilty after pleading guilty, a plea he later rescinded, but which rescission the Court did not accept.\n\nOn September 4, 1998, the ICTR condemned Jean Kambanda to life imprisonment for:\n\nJoy Mukanyange, the Rwandan Ambassador to Tanzania was the only Rwandan official who attended the sentencing. She thought it fair that Kambanda received a life sentence and his crimes had been recognized by the international community. She noted that Rwanda was \"not looking for revenge\".\n\nThis verdict was upheld by the ICTR Appeal Chamber on October 19, 2000, and Kambanda is currently jailed in Koulikoro Prison in Mali.\n\nAlthough Kambanda pleaded guilty after receiving legal counsel, his lawyer argued that the prime minister was a \"puppet\" of the military, who had dragged him from his bank, after killing the previous prime minister, to legitimize their control of their country. He asked the ICTR for a sentence of two years because he acted \"under duress with limited responsibility\".\n\nThe court concluded that this defense against a charge of genocide was irrelevant.\n\nIn 2006 he testified for the defence of Colonel Theoneste Bagosora in the 'Military 1' trial of senior military leaders. That testimony was the former Prime Minister's first and only public testimony on the 1994 events in Rwanda and in which he said that he had never found a plan to commit genocide. The decisions of the ICTR regarding Kambanda have been subject to criticism.\n\nIn his appeal, Kambanda said that his confession had been in error, due to poor or misunderstood counsel. He said that his objective was not to plead guilty but to tell the truth. According to the ICTR appeal:\n\nAs a head of government convicted by an international court, Kambanda is an important figure, with the verdict against him forming a precedent against the legal principle of State Immunity (which was used to reject an extradition order for Augusto Pinochet, for example).\n\n"}

Their crops had failed and the area had been overhunted, and they were starving. In a meeting at the Upper Sioux Agency on August 4, US Indian Agent Thomas Galbraith directed that only some food be released to the Dakota from the warehouse, as annuity supplies and payments had been delayed by the American Civil War and a government preoccupied with the Northern Virginia Campaign, which threatened the safety of the capital, Washington D.C. \n\nAndrew Myrick had stores at both Yellow Medicine (also known as the Upper Sioux Agency) and Redwood (Lower Sioux Agency).

Myrick was killed on the first day at the Battle of Lower Sioux Agency, where Dakota warriors took revenge at the agency for its failure to give them food.

Bjørn is remembered for his collapse at Royal St. George's during the 2003 Open Championship, when he led by two strokes with three holes to play, but took three attempts to get out of a greenside bunker on the par three 16th, handing the tournament to Ben Curtis. He captained the winning European side at the 2018 Ryder Cup.\n\nBjørn started his career playing on the Challenge Tour from 1993 to 1995. In 1995 he won four tournaments on the Challenge Tour to earn his card for his debut year on the European Tour in 1996. Bjørn made his breakthrough immediately winning his maiden tour title in his debut season at the Loch Lomond World Invitational. He became the first golfer from Denmark to win a tournament on the European Tour.

He won early in the 1998 season in Perth, Australia taking the Heineken Classic for his second European Tour title. Despite an over par final round of 74, Bjørn won by a single stroke from Ian Woosnam. In April 1998, after a five-week break from competitive golf, Bjørn won for the second time that year at the Peugeot Open de Espana after a final round 66 took him to 21 under and one stroke ahead of the chasing pack. He later said: \"I didn’t really expect this after taking five weeks off, but when your confidence has gone like mine did after winning in Perth, it just shows it’s best to take a break and regroup.\" After his two wins he finished the year 6th on the Order of Merit.\n\nAfter a winless period due to injuries and the birth of his first child, Bjørn returned to the winner's circle in October 1999 at the Sarazen World Open.

It was the site of the Battle of Lower Sioux Agency on August 18, 1862, the first organized battle of the Dakota War of 1862. Today it is a historic site managed by the Lower Sioux Community in partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society. The site contains an interpretive center, self-guided trails, and a restored 1861 stone warehouse which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Lower Sioux Agency was established in 1853 by the United States government, to oversee the newly created Lower Sioux Indian Reservation. This reservation was to be the home for the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute bands following the 1851 Treaty of Mendota.\n\nOn August 15, 1862, the Lower Sioux turned to the Agency staff for supplies. Representatives of the northern Sissetowan and Wahpeton Dakota bands had successfully negotiated to obtain food at the Upper Sioux Agency on August 4. However Thomas J. Galbraith, the Indian agent in charge, rejected the Lower Sioux bands as he would not distribute food to these bands without payment. At a meeting of the Dakota, the U.S. government and local traders, the Dakota representatives asked the representative of the government traders, Andrew J. Myrick, to sell them food on credit. His response was said to be, \"So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry let them eat grass or their own dung.\"\n\nOn August 16, 1862, the treaty payments to the Dakota arrived in St. Paul, Minnesota, and were brought to Fort Ridgely the next day. They arrived too late to prevent violence. On August 17, 1862, four young Dakota men were on a hunting trip in Acton Township, Minnesota, during which one stole eggs and then killed five white settlers. Soon after, a Dakota war council was convened and their leader, Little Crow, agreed to continue attacks on the European-American settlements to try to drive out the whites.\n\nOn August 18, 1862, Little Crow led a group that attacked the Lower Sioux Agency. Andrew Myrick was discovered trying to escape through a second-floor window of a building at the agency. Myrick's body later was found with grass stuffed into his mouth because of his recent statement (See above). The warriors burned the buildings at the Lower Sioux Agency, giving enough time for settlers to escape across the river at Redwood Ferry. Minnesota militia forces and B Company of the 5th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment sent to quell the uprising were defeated at the Battle of Redwood Ferry. Twenty-four soldiers, including the party's commander (Captain John Marsh), were killed in the battle. Throughout the day, Dakota war parties swept the Minnesota River Valley and near vicinity, killing many settlers. Numerous settlements including the Townships of Milford, Leavenworth and Sacred Heart, were surrounded and burned and their populations nearly exterminated.\n\nSelf-guided trails take visitors around the site. The 1861 granary is the only surviving structure from the agency. Interpretive signs mark the locations of other features, including the location of the Redwood Ferry crossing the Minnesota River. Period gardens and plots demonstrate differences between traditional Dakota and Euro-American farming.\n\n"}

His major work is the monument to the Duke of Wellington in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nAlfred Stevens was born on 30 December 1817 at Blandford Forum in Dorset, the son of a decorator and joiner. At the age of ten, he entered his father's workshop as an assistant. In 1833, the rector of his parish enabled him to go to Italy, where he spent nine years studying at Naples, Bologna, Siena, Pompeii, Capri, Rome, Milan, Venice, and Florence where he studied for a time at the Accademia di Belle Arti. Stevens had never attended an English school. In 1841, Bertel Thorvaldsen employed him for a year in Rome. After a significant period of study and training throughout Italy, Stevens returned to England.\n\nIn 1845, Stevens obtained a tutorial position in the School of Design at Somerset House, London, where he remained until 1847. In 1850 he became chief artist to the Sheffield firm of H.E. Hoole and Co. who specialised in bronze and metal work. While in Sheffield it is thought that Stevens devised plans which were eventually integrated into the design of the ornate gateway of the Green Lane Works of 1860. In 1852 he returned to London. To this period belongs his design for the vases on the railings in front of the British Museum, and also the lions on the dwarf posts which were subsequently transferred to the inside of the museum.\n\nIn 1856, Stevens took part in the competition for the Wellington monument, originally intended to be set up under one of the great arches of St Paul's Cathedral, though it was only consigned to that position in 1892. Stevens agreed to carry out the monument for £20,000 – a quite derisory sum, as it turned out. Stevens devoted most of his career to this grand monument, constantly harassed and finally worn out by the interference of government, want of money and other difficulties.\n\nStevens did not live to see the monument set up. For many years it was placed in a small side chapel, where the effect was utterly destroyed and its magnificent bronze groups hidden from view. Stevens was aware of the position finally decided on for the work, and he suppressed the equestrian group intended for the summit and left the model for the latter feature in a rough state. On the removal of the monument from the chapel to the inter-columnar space on the north side of the nave for which it was originally designed, the model of horse and man was placed in the hands of another sculptor, to be worked upon and cast in bronze. It was still not completed by 1920, after years of work and polemics, and it was feared that it would have a disastrous result on the masterpiece as a whole. The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects declared that the structure would not bear the weight of the addition.\n\nThe monument consists of a sarcophagus supporting a recumbent bronze effigy of the duke, over which is an arched marble canopy of late Renaissance style on delicately enriched shafts. At each end of the upper part of the canopy is a large bronze group, one representing \"Truth tearing the tongue out of the mouth of False-hood\", and the other \"Valour trampling Cowardice underfoot\". The two virtues are represented by very stately female figures modelled with wonderful beauty and vigour; the vices are two nude male figures treated in a very massive way. The vigorous strength of these groups recalls the style of Michelangelo, but Stevens's work throughout is original and has a very distinct character of its own.\n\nOwing to the many years he spent on this one work Stevens produced little other sculpture. In Dorchester House (demolished in 1929 to make way for the hotel of the same name), Park Lane, there was some of his work, most notably a mantelpiece supported by nude female caryatids in a crouching attitude, modelled with great largeness of style, now in the central refreshment room at the Victoria and Albert museum. He also designed the four mosaics of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, which fill the spandrels under the dome of St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nOne of his pupils was Edgar Bundy.\n\nStevens resided at 7 Canning Place in Kensington, London. He died suddenly in his studio in London, aged 57. The cause of his death is unspecified. He is buried in the western part of Highgate Cemetery in North London.\n\n"}

The elder Gretzky, an avid hockey player as a youth and a keen analyst of the game, is credited by his famous son as playing a key role in his phenomenal success as a player. Walter coached his hockey-loving son continuously, starting at age three, building him a backyard rink, devising creative exercises and drills, teaching him profound insights into how to play successfully, and accompanying him to most of his games. He is famous for instructing Wayne and his brothers to “Go to where the puck is going, not where it has been.\"\n\nThe elder Gretzky is well known in his own right for his contributions to minor hockey in Canada, and for his dedication to helping many local, provincial, and national charities, for which he has been honoured and recognized.\n\nThe Gretzky family were landowners in the Russian Empire, and supporters of Tsar Nicholas II originally from Grodno/Hrodna (now in the Republic of Belarus). Prior to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Gretzky's father Anton (\"Tony\") Gretzky (; pronounced \"Hretskyy\"), a white émigré, immigrated along with his family to Canada via the United States from Ukraine. Following World War I, Anton, who served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, would marry his wife, Mary, who immigrated from Podhajce, interwar Poland (now Ukraine).\n\nGretzky's ancestry is typically described as either Belarusian, Ukrainian, or Polish. In interviews, Walter Gretzky has stated that his parents were \"White Russians from Belarus\", and whenever anyone asked his father if they were Russian, he would reply, \"\"Nyet.\" Belarus.\" On other occasions he has mentioned his family's Polish ancestry. However, according to one source \"the only Slavic language spoken in the Gretzky family [was] Ukrainian,\" of which Walter was a fluent speaker from birth, while according to the Belarusian Wikipedia article about Wayne, his paternal grandfather spoke Belarusian.\n\nTony and Mary owned a cucumber farm in Canning, Ontario where Walter Gretzky was born and raised. This is where he met his future wife, Phyllis Hockin at a wiener roast when she was 15 and he was 18. She was a descendant of British General Sir Isaac Brock, a hero of the War of 1812. They married in 1960, and moved to Brantford, Ontario, where Gretzky worked for Bell Telephone Canada. The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after the birth of their son, Wayne Gretzky, chosen partly because the yard was flat enough to be able to make an ice rink every winter. The couple would later have a daughter, Kim (b. 1963), and three more sons, Keith, Glen (b. 1969), and Brent. Unlike Walter, who did Sharp ViewCam commercials with Wayne and Wayne's son, Ty, Phyllis Gretzky mostly refused to embrace the celebrity that sprang from their son's exploits, although she did a commercial with Wayne for ProStars Cereal in the 1980's and appeared in the video \"Wayne Gretzky: Above and Beyond\" (1990).\n\nWalter was an excellent athlete in high school. He excelled in track, setting school records in running, pole vault, and long jump. However, he was even better at hockey, and in his teens was a prolific goal-scorer during five years of play with the Junior B-level Woodstock Warriors. He set his sights on the National Hockey League (NHL), and some thought he was destined to make it there. A local car salesman, in order to encourage the rising hockey star, bestowed a new car on him for a nominal charge, so that he could more easily drive to hockey games in and around Woodstock, but his size and weight, at 5-foot-9 inches and 140 lbs, was a problem. He tried out for a major team at the Junior A level, but unfortunately, just a few weeks beforehand, came down with chicken pox, losing considerable weight. Although he scored just as many goals in the tryout game as any of his fellow hopefuls, he was judged to be too small for the higher league. He returned to play with the Woodstock team.\n\nWalter was an installer and repairman for Bell Canada for 34 years, retiring in 1991. A work-related injury he suffered in 1961 left him in a coma and resulted in deafness in his right ear. Five days after his 53rd birthday, in 1991, he suffered a near-fatal brain aneurysm which destroyed his short-term memory. His physical therapist, Ian Kohler, married his daughter Kim in 1995. His ordeal is the basis of the CBC movie \"Waking Up Wally: The Walter Gretzky Story\". He spends his time helping charities and fundraisers and coaching at his summer youth hockey camp in California. In his book Walter recounts that during his recovery from his brain aneurysm, the only language he could speak was Ukrainian.\n\nSome said that his son Wayne, lauded by most sportswriters and the NHL itself as the greatest hockey player who ever lived, had God-given abilities, but Wayne gave a great deal of credit to his father's brilliant coaching.\n\nThe elder Gretzky devised numerous creative ways to develop hockey skills. Walter's drills were his own invention, but were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing to offer him: \"I'd been doing those drills since I was three. My Dad was very smart.\"\n\nSome say I have a 'sixth sense' . . . Baloney, I've just learned to guess what's going to happen next. Its anticipation. It's not God-given, it's Wally-given. He used to stand on the blue line and say to me, 'Watch, this is how everybody else does it.' Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and into the corner and then go chasing after it. Then he'd come back and say, 'Now, this is how the smart player does it.' He'd shoot it into the corner again, only this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over there. Who says anticipation can't be taught?\n\nIn his autobiography, Wayne describes how his Dad would teach him the fundamentals of smart hockey, quiz style:\n\n<poem>Him: \"Where do you skate?\"\nMe: \"To where the puck is going, not where it's been.\"\nHim: \"Where's the last place a guy looks before he passes it?\"\nMe: \"The guy he's passing to.\"\nHim: \"Which means...\"\nMe: \"Get over there and intercept it.\"\nHim: \"If you get cut off, what are you gonna do?\"\nMe: \"Peel.\"\nHim: \"Which way?\"\nMe: \"Away from the guy, not towards him.\"</poem>\n\nFrom September 2004 to April 2005, Walter was an assistant coach for the University of Pittsburgh inline hockey team. A long time friend of head coach Bob Coyne, Walter was hired by team president Ryan Gaus as an assistant coach, along with Bob Bradley and Tim Fryer. Pitt participated in the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association (ECRHA) at the Division I level.\n\nWalter has been working for the CNIB (formerly the Canadian National Institute for the Blind). The entire Gretzky family is now associated with the CNIB.\n\nThe Gretzky's support of the CNIB started when Walter’s son Wayne was 19 years old. Two completely blind boys started to talk to him, and one recognized Wayne just by his voice. Wayne felt a sense of compassion and persuaded his father to set up a golf tournament to raise cash for the CNIB. These tournaments soon gained fame and attracted NHL players and celebrities. Brendan Shanahan, the Toronto Maple Leafs, Brett Hull, Gordie Howe, Scott Stevens, Mark Messier, Marty McSorley, Glen Campbell and Paul Coffey are among hockey names that have attended. Celebrities who have attended include John Candy, Rob Lowe, Teri Garr, Alan Thicke, Jamie Farr, Bob Woods, Kevin Smith, and David Foster. All the money from these tournaments go across Canada to help visually impaired students have money and scholarships to go to universities. At the first tournament, Walter had enough money raised to award three scholarships; now he awards 15 scholarships a year. After eleven years, these tournaments had raised over three million dollars.\n\nAnother fundraiser that Walter Gretzky does is the SCORE program (Summer Computer Orientation Recreational Education). SCORE helps blind students learn computer skills that will be needed for jobs in the future and increases blind student’s access to computer programs and internet applications. So far SCORE has provided over 500 career positions for visually impaired students.\n\nFans come to his house to see his basement, stuffed with mementos from Wayne's amateur career, and his backyard, which, every winter, was turned into a \"rink\" on which Walter taught his sons and their friends to play hockey. The \"rink\" was replaced by a swimming pool on the day Wayne was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. His other children – Kim, Keith, Glen, and Brent – were also athletic. Brent, drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning, played 13 NHL games. Keith, drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in 1985, never made it to the NHL but has coached in the minors (he was Brent's coach when both were with the UHL Asheville Smoke). Kim was an exceptional track and field star, but broke her foot at the age of 15 and never ran again.\nWalter Gretzky has written two books: \"On Family, Hockey and Healing\" (2003), and \"Gretzky: From Backyard Rink to the Stanley Cup\" (1985), in which he recounted how he recognized Wayne's prodigious skills and shaped him into the most prolific scorer in hockey history. In an unusually frank 1990 interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Wayne recounted how Walter would build him up one minute and tear him down the next, reminding him constantly that he could never have an \"average\" game.\n\nPhyllis died of lung cancer at Brantford General Hospital on December 19, 2005. Her mother, Betty Hockin, died in Brantford on January 7, 2006 from complications from a heart attack.\n\nWalter Gretzky was named to the Order of Canada on 28 December 2007, \"for his contributions to minor hockey in Canada and for his dedication to helping a myriad of local, provincial, and national charities.\"\n\nOn February 12, 2010, Walter had the chance to carry the Olympic Torch during the Olympic Relay on the last day of the relay, hours before the Opening Ceremonies in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his son would light the Olympic Flame.\n\nOn April 12, 2012, in his home town of Brantford, Ontario, the Grand Erie District School Board opened Walter Gretzky Elementary School. It is part of a dual-track Catholic-Public Green School with the Brant Haldimand-Norfolk Catholic District School Board's St. Basil's School.\n\n"}
{"id": "1891090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891090", "title": "Spoon River Anthology", "text": "Spoon River Anthology\n\nSpoon River Anthology (1915), by Edgar Lee Masters, is a collection of short free verse poems that collectively narrates the epitaphs of the residents of Spoon River, a fictional small town named after the real Spoon River that ran near Masters' home town of Lewistown, Illinois. The aim of the poems is to demystify rural and small town American life. The collection includes 212 separate characters, in all providing 244 accounts of their lives, losses, and manner of death. Many of the poems contain cross-references that create an unabashed tapestry of the community. The poems were originally published in 1914 in the St. Louis, Missouri literary journal \"Reedy's Mirror\", under the pseudonym Webster Ford.\n\nThe first poem serves as an introduction:\n\n\"The Hill\"\nWhere are Elmer, Herman, Bert, Tom and Charley,\nThe weak of will, the strong of arm, the clown, the boozer, the fighter?\nAll, all are sleeping on the hill.\nOne passed in a fever,\nOne was burned in a mine,\nOne was killed in a brawl,\nOne died in a jail,\nOne fell from a bridge toiling for children and wife—\nAll, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.\nWhere are Ella, Kate, Mag, Lizzie and Edith,\nThe tender heart, the simple soul, the loud, the proud, the happy one?—\nAll, all are sleeping on the hill.\nOne died in shameful child-birth,\nOne of a thwarted love,\nOne at the hands of a brute in a brothel,\nOne of a broken pride, in the search for heart’s desire;\nOne after life in far-away London and Paris\nWas brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag—\nAll, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.\nWhere are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily,\nAnd old Towny Kincaid and Sevigne Houghton,\nAnd Major Walker who had talked\nWith venerable men of the revolution?—\nAll, all are sleeping on the hill.\nThey brought them dead sons from the war,\nAnd daughters whom life had crushed,\nAnd their children fatherless, crying—\nAll, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill.\nWhere is Old Fiddler Jones\nWho played with life all his ninety years,\nBraving the sleet with bared breast,\nDrinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin,\nNor gold, nor love, nor heaven?\nLo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago,\nOf the horse-races of long ago at Clary’s Grove,\nOf what Abe Lincoln said\nOne time at Springfield.\nEach following poem is an autobiographical epitaph of a dead citizen, delivered by the dead themselves. Characters include Tom Merritt, Amos Sibley, Carl Hamblin, Fiddler Jones and A.D. Blood. They speak about the sorts of things one might expect: some recite their histories and turning points, others make observations of life from the outside, and petty ones complain of the treatment of their graves, while few tell how they really died. The subject of afterlife receives only the occasional brief mention, and even those seem to be contradictory. Speaking without reason to lie or fear the consequences, they construct a picture of life in their town that is shorn of façades. The interplay of various villagers — e.g. a bright and successful man crediting his parents for all he's accomplished, and an old woman weeping because he is secretly her illegitimate child — forms a gripping, if not pretty, whole.\n\nMany of the characters who make appearances in \"Spoon River Anthology\" were based on real people that Masters knew or heard of in the two towns in which he grew up, Petersburg and Lewistown, Illinois. Masters sometimes substantially disguised the names of these real-life inspirations, but he sometimes disguised them only barely and, in a few cases, not at all. Most notable is Ann Rutledge, regarded in local legend to be Abraham Lincoln's early love interest (though there is no actual proof of such a relationship); Masters heard this legend from his grandfather. Rutledge's grave can still be found in a Petersburg cemetery, and a tour of graveyards in both towns, especially Oak Hill Cemetery in Lewistown, reveals most of the surnames that Masters applied to his characters.\n\nAfter growing up and leaving Lewistown for Chicago, Masters met and befriended William Marion Reedy, the owner, publisher and editor of the St. Louis-based literary magazine \"Reedy's Mirror.\" By the time Masters wrote the poems that would become \"Spoon River Anthology,\" he had already published some poetry, with some success; these prior poems, however, were more conventional in style and subject matter. Masters would later write that it was Reedy, through his criticism and friendship, who encouraged him to write “something more distinctive than what I was doing, somehow, someway, but without telling me how to do it.” Masters in particular credited Reedy with introducing him to the \"Greek Anthology,\" a collection of classical period epigrams, to which \"Spoon River Anthology\" is stylistically similar.\n\n\"Spoon River Anthology\" was originally published in serial form in \"Reedy's Mirror\" from May 29, 1914 until January 5, 1915. The poems were attributed initially to the pseudonym Webster Ford. William Marion Reedy, owner, publisher and editor of the magazine revealed the poems’ true authorship in November 1914, after 21 weekly entries.\n\nThe first bound edition of \"Spoon River Anthology\" was published by The Macmillan Company in 1915 with a total of 209 poems. Masters added 35 new poems in the 1916 edition, expanding on new characters with connections to some of the originals. Among these new additions were \"Andy the Night-Watch\", \"Isa Nutter,\" \"Plymouth Rock Joe\" and \"The Epilogue.\"\n\n\"Spoon River Anthology\" was a critical and commercial success. Ezra Pound's review of the Spoon River poems begins, \"At last! At last America has discovered a poet.\" Carl Sandburg's review is similarly glowing: \"Once in a while a man comes along who writes a book that has his own heart-beats in it. The people whose faces look out from the pages of the book are the people of life itself, each trait of them as plain or as mysterious as in the old home valley where the writer came from. Such a writer and book are realized here.\" The book sold 80,000 copies over four years, making it an international bestseller by the standards of the day.\n\nMeanwhile, those who lived in the Spoon River region objected to their portrayal in the anthology, particularly as so many of the poems' characters were based on real people. The book was banned from Lewistown schools and libraries until 1974. Even Masters's mother, who sat on the Lewistown library board, voted for the ban. (Masters himself claimed, \"My mother disliked [the anthology]; my father adored it.\" Despite this, the anthology remained widely read in Lewistown; local historian Kelvin Sampson notes that \"Every family in Lewistown probably had a sheet of paper or a notebook hidden away with their copy of the \"Anthology,\" saying who was who in town.\"\n\nMasters capitalized on the success of \"The Spoon River Anthology\" with a 1924 sequel, \"The New Spoon River\", in which Spoon River became a suburb of Chicago and its inhabitants have been urbanized. The second work was less successful and received poorer reviews. In 1933, Masters wrote a retrospective essay on the composition of \"The Spoon River Anthology\" and the response it received, entitled \"The Genesis of Spoon River.\" He recounts, among other things, the \"exhaustion of body\" that befell him while writing, which eventually manifested in pneumonia and a year-long bout of illness as the work was being prepared for publication. He claims that the Lewistown residents who strove to identify the poems' characters with real people did so only \"with poor success.\"\n\nMore recently, Lewistown celebrated its relationship to Masters' poetry. The Oak Hill Cemetery features a memorial statue of Masters and offers a self-guided walking tour of the graves that inspired the poems. In 2015, the town celebrated the 100th anniversary of the anthology's publication with tours, exhibitions and theatrical performances.\n\nToday \"Spoon River Anthology\" is often assigned in high school and college literature classes and as a source of monologues for theatrical auditions. It is also often used in second year characterization work in the Meisner technique of actor training.\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the American Civil War, as well as for two subsequent decades before retiring as a rear admiral.\n\nWells was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, and attended school there. He was appointed as a midshipman in the Navy on September 25, 1840, and spent a year at the Mediterranean Station before serving at the Home Station from 1842 to 1843. For the next two years, Wells served in the Pacific Squadron. He attended the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1846 and graduated from its Naval School. He became a Passed Midshipman on July 11, 1846.\n\nWells was assigned to duty during the Mexican–American War blockading Vera Cruz. He sailed around the world from 1848 until 1851. Returning to the United States, he married Mary S. Walsh on September 11, 1851. Wells received a promotion to Master Commandant in 1855, then was commissioned lieutenant in September of that year. In 1857, served on and was part of the first expedition to lay a transatlantic telegraph cable.\n\nAt the start of the American Civil War, Wells was suffering from exhaustion and exposure from this travels, coupled with depression from the recent death of his beloved brother-in-law, with whom he had sailed for twelve years. Consequently, he spent three months in the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane in Philadelphia where he was diagnosed as having Melancholia, being released on October 11, 1861, to return to active duty. He was appointed executive officer of the and took part in the capture of Port Royal, South Carolina, on November 7, 1861.\n\nHe was promoted to lieutenant-commander on July 16, 1862, then became the executive officer of the Philadelphia Navy Yard in early 1863. During this time, sent a letter to the United States Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, that accused Maj. Granville O. Haller, former commander of George B.

{"id": "1891094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891094", "title": "Come Out, Ye Black and Tans", "text": "Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\n\nCome Out, Ye Black and Tans is an Irish rebel song referring to the Black and Tans, who were \"special reserve constables\" (mainly former World War I army soldiers), recruited in Great Britain and sent to Ireland from 1920, to reinforce the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence. The song was written by Dominic Behan as a tribute to his Irish Republican Army (IRA) father Stephen, who had fought in the War of Independence, and is concerned with political divisions in working-class Dublin of the 1920s. The song uses the term \"Black and Tans\" in the pejorative sense against people living in Dublin, both Catholic and Protestant, who were pro-British. The most notable recording was in 1972 by the Irish traditional music group, The Wolfe Tones, which re-charted in 2020.\n\nThe song is attributed to Irish songwriter Dominic Behan, who was born into the literary Behan family in Dublin in 1928 (his brother was Brendan Behan). The date of when the song was written is not recorded, but Behan was active as a songwriter from 1958 onwards. The setting of the song is the Dublin into which Behan was born in the mid-1920s, and the main character in the song (who is calling his neighbours \"Black and Tans\"), is attributed to being Behan's father, Stephen Behan, who was a prominent Irish republican, and who had fought in the Irish War of Independence, and the Irish Civil War. At times, the song has been incorrectly attributed to Stephen Behan as the author.\n\nThe melody of the song was adapted by Behan from an old air, \"\" (Irish for \"Battlecry of Munster\"), by Piaras Mac Gearailt (Pierce FitzGerald, c. 1709 – c. 1792), which is also ironically used by the loyalist song, \"The Boyne Water\".\n\nWhile the song title and lyrics refer to the Black and Tans from the War of Independence, the song itself is a dispute between republican and unionist neighbours in inner-city Dublin in the Irish Free State era of the mid-1920s. During this era, Dublin continued to elect unionist pro-British politicians and voluntary service in the British Army was a popular career choice amongst working-class Dubliners, for both Catholics and Protestants. Supporting this tradition was the existence of a relatively large, and now generally forgotten and disappeared, Dublin Protestant working class. It is this pro-British working class of both religions, who the composer is confronting in the song (a noted representation of this cultural group is Bessie Burgess in the Seán O'Casey play \"The Plough and the Stars\").\n\nIn the chorus, the composer is pejoratively labelling his Dublin neighbours, who are pro-British and ex-British army (\"show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders\"). He calls them \"Black and Tans\", and asks them to come out and \"fight me like a man\", stating that the \"IRA\" (Irish Republican Army), had made the Black and Tans \"run like hell away\" from rural Ireland such as the \"green and lovely lanes of Killeshandra\" (which is in County Cavan, and where, in 1922, ex-RIC and Black and Tan soldiers were forced to flee the town after being given a few days warning to leave by the local IRA).\n\nThe lyrics make references to the history of Irish nationalism, and the struggle of lesser armed peoples against the British Army, with: \"Come tell us how you slew them poor Arabs two by two / Like the Zulus, they had spears and bows and arrows\". The lyrics reference the disdain by his neighbours (saying \"sneers and jeers that you bravely let us hear\"), to the execution of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising, and to the fall of the Irish nationalist political leader, Charles Stuart Parnell.\n\nThere are variations of the original lyrics that incorporate references to more modern events in Irish nationalism, such as The Troubles.\n\nThe most notable recording of the song was by the Irish traditional group, The Wolfe Tones, who recorded the song on their 1972 album, \"Let the People Sing\", and which credited the writing of the song to Joe Giltrap and Wes McGhee (who were traditional musicians but not band members), and an \"unknown PD writer\". The Wolfe Tones version of the song recharted in 2019–2020 (see below), and the group posted on their Twitter account that the proceeds from the re-charting would be donated to an Irish homeless charity run by Peter McVerry.\n\nThe song has been recorded by other artists including:\n\nIn an article about the violence and bigotry surrounding Old Firm football matches, the \"Irish Independent\" said: \"Then there's the stereotypical image of the Celtic supporters wearing T-shirts of 'undefeated army' and having their phones ringing to the sound of 'Come out ye black and tans'\".\n\nIn March 2019, Irish food company, Brady Family Ham, released an advertising video that went viral, which used the tune of the song but with amended lyrics, and replacing the word \"Tan\" with \"Ham\", that was directed by \"Father Ted\" director, Declan Lowney.\n\nIn March 2019, episode four of Steve Coogan’s \"This Time with Alan Partridge\", ended with a rendition of \"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\" by Coogan, acting in-character as the fictional Irish performer Martin Brennan (played as an eccentric rural Irish farmer). \"The Guardian\" reported that: \"Irish Twitter went wild and the Wolfe Tones’ rendition of the song started to penetrate foreign consciousness on easily the biggest scale since Behan apparently put pen to paper\". \"RTE News\" called it \"the TV moment of the year\".\n\nIn January 2020, The Wolfe Tones' version of \"'Come Out Ye Black and Tans\" reached number 1 on the Ireland and UK iTunes charts, as part of \"widespread criticism\" of the (Irish) Government's planned commemoration of the RIC, as part of its \"Decade of Commemoration\" (commemorating the events of 19121922 in Ireland). As a result of this, on 10 January, the song entered the Irish Singles Chart at No. 33, and also debuted at No. 1 in the Scottish Singles Chart, which only counts paid-for sales and does not include streaming.\n\nThe song was used on occasions by Irish political party Sinn Féin, during the 2020 Irish general election, and was listed in the \"10 defining moments\" of the election by the \"Irish Independent\".\n\nThe Wolfe Tones version\n\n"}

In September 1943, 14 commandos and sailors from the Allied Z Special Unit raided Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour, sinking six ships.\n\nSpecial Operations Australia (SOA), a joint Allied military intelligence organisation, was established in March 1942. SOA operated under the cover name Inter-Allied Services Department (IASD). It contained several British SOE officers who had escaped from Japanese occupied Singapore, and they formed the nucleus of the IASD, which was based in Melbourne. In June 1942, a commando arm was organised as Z Special Unit (which was later commonly known as Z Force). It drew its personnel primarily from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy.\n\nIn 1943, a 28-year-old British officer, Captain (later Major) Ivan Lyon (of the Allied Intelligence Bureau and Gordon Highlanders), and a 61-year-old Australian civilian, Bill Reynolds, devised a plan to attack Japanese shipping in Singapore Harbour. Commandos would travel to the harbour in a vessel disguised as an Asian fishing boat. They would then use folboats (collapsible canoes) to attach limpet mines to Japanese ships.\n\nInitial training for the raid was organised and carried out by Major Lyon and Captain Davidson at Refuge Bay. The site selected was a remote, inaccessible area along the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales and named 'Camp X' for the purpose. Folboats were essential for training the prospective operatives, however only two; a one-man and a two-man were found to be suitable after a thorough search in Australia by Military personnel. These were bought on the spot from the folboat builder Walter Hoehn after a test run on the Yarra River, Alphington by the head of the Inter Allied Services Department Colonel Mott and Major Moneypenny. A wooden rigid canoe was also built for Camp-X by trainees under the supervision of Davidson.\n\nReynolds was in possession of a Japanese coastal fish carrier, \"Kofuku Maru\" 幸福丸, which he had used to evacuate refugees from Singapore. Lyon ordered that the boat be shipped from India to Australia. Upon its arrival, he renamed the vessel \"Krait\", after the small but deadly Asian snake.\n\nIn mid-1943, \"Krait\" travelled from a training camp at Broken Bay, New South Wales to Thursday Island. Aboard was a complement from Z Special Unit of three British and eleven Australian personnel, comprising:\n\n\nOn 13 August 1943, \"Krait\" left Thursday Island for Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, where it was refuelled and repairs were undertaken. Not only did the repairs cause delays in departure, but the folboats, manufactured by Harris Lebus and designated as model MKI**, which had been specially ordered for the attack by Lyon from England only arrived at the last minute. They were found to be faulty, lacked some important parts and were not according to the design that Davidson had specified. They had to undergo many on the spot changes simply to make each framework fit together and then fit correctly into the outer skins. This left the crew little time to get accustomed to them before being loaded on to \"Krait\".\nOn 2 September 1943, \"Krait\" left Exmouth Gulf and departed for Singapore. The team's safety depended on maintaining the disguise of a local fishing boat. The men stained their skin brown with dye to appear more Asiatic and were meticulous in what sort of rubbish they threw overboard, lest a trail of European garbage arouse suspicion. After a relatively uneventful voyage, \"Krait\" arrived off Singapore on 24 September. That night, six men left the boat and paddled with folboats (collapsible canoes) to establish a forward base in a cave on a small island near the harbour. On the night of 26 September 1943, they paddled into the harbour and placed limpet mines on several Japanese ships before returning to their hiding spot.\n\nIn the resulting explosions, the limpet mines allegedly sank or seriously damaged seven Japanese ships, comprising over 39,000 tons between them. The commandos waited until the commotion over the attack had subsided and then returned to \"Krait\", which they reached on 2 October. Their return to Australia was mostly uneventful, except for a tense incident in the Lombok Strait when the ship was closely approached by a Japanese auxiliary minesweeper Wa-102 on patrol; however \"Krait\" was not challenged. On 19 October, the ship and crew arrived safely back at Exmouth Gulf.\n\nRecent analysis of Japanese records and radio decrypts have identified only 6 ships sunk or damaged. Japanese radio messages only reference six ships attacked, and it is highly probable the attack on the seventh failed.\n\nThe often repeated claim that the saboteurs sank the large high speed tanker \"Shinkoku Maru\" (Sinkoku Maru in kokutai spelling) is not supported by Japanese records that clearly show the ship leaving Truk (Chuuk), Carolines Islands on the day of the attack.\n\nThe raid took the Japanese authorities in Singapore completely by surprise. Never suspecting such an attack could be mounted from Australia, they assumed it had been carried out by local saboteurs, most likely pro-Communist Chinese guerillas. In their efforts to uncover the perpetrators, a wave of arrests, torture and executions began. Local Chinese and Malays, as well as interned POWs and European civilians were targeted in this programme. The incident became known as the Double Tenth, for 10 October, the day that Japanese secret police began the mass arrests.\n\nGiven the misery inflicted upon the local population by the Japanese, criticism has arisen as to whether Operation Jaywick was justified, especially with its relatively limited strategic results. In the aftermath of the raid, the Allies never claimed responsibility for the attack on shipping, most likely because they wanted to preserve the secret of \"Krait\" for future similar missions. Therefore, the Japanese did not divert significant military resources to defending against such attacks, instead just using their secret police to enact reprisals against civilians.\n\nOperation Jaywick was followed by Operation Rimau. Although three ships are sometimes claimed as sunk in this raid, no corroboration of this has ever been found and in all likelihood no vessels were sunk; but the participants, including Lyon, were either killed in action or captured and executed.\n\nAustralian novelist Ronald McKie wrote an account of the operation in 1961 titled \"The Heroes\". In 1989, a British/Australian miniseries dramatized McKie's book. The Heroes was directed by Donald Crombie, with the cast including Paul Rhys as Ivan Lyon, John Bach as Donald Davidson and Jason Donovan as 'Happy' Houston.\n\n\n\n"}

Its Roman name was Arpinum. In Roman times, the town produced two consuls of the Roman Republic: Gaius Marius and Marcus Tullius Cicero.\n\nThe ancient city of Arpinum dates back to at least the 7th century BC. Connected with the Pelasgi, the Volsci and Samnite people, it was captured by the Romans and granted \"civitas sine suffragio\" in 305 BC. The city gained Roman suffrage in 188 BC and the status of a \"municipium\" in 90 BC.\n\nThe town produced both Gaius Marius and Marcus Tullius Cicero, who were homines novi (people from new families who were elected to the Roman Senate, usually referring to those who had reached the office of Consul). Cicero, in speeches before the courts in Rome, would later praise his hometown's contributions to the Republic when attacked as a \"foreigner\", for Arpinum had twice borne men to save the Republic: Marius against the Cimbric invaders of 101 BC and Cicero himself against the Second Catilinarian conspiracy. Cicero in letters to his friend Atticus referred often to the peace and quiet of his beloved Arpinum. There is an oral tradition that persists to this day that Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was also a native of Arpinum. Historians however have not been able to confirm his place of birth.\n\nBeside the ancient town of Arpinum there are the fortified remains of a much earlier Samnite town. The high defensive walls are of the polygonal type associated historically with these people. There is an example of an arch of this type which can still be still seen today. Dates are generally from the early Roman period to about 400 BC. The recent suggestions that these walls were created by some superior beings given their large size blocks is considered to be completely untrue and scurrilous. The Stone is some times referred to as \"puddingstone\" but in this case it seem to be of a more sedimentary dark gray type. Arpinum, Atina, and Cominium were known Samnite strongholds. The Valle di Comino nearby is considered to be strong Samnite and subsections of the tribes home lands and the language generally spoken up to the Roman assimilations was Oscan part of the \"Co\" group of Indo-European languages.\n\nIn the early Middle Ages, the Roman duchy and the Duchy of Benevento contended for its strategic position. After the 11th century it was ruled by the Normans, the Hohenstaufen and by the Papal States. It was destroyed twice; in 1229 by Frederick II and in 1242 by Conrad IV.\n\nThe castrato sopranist Gioacchino Conti, known as \"Il Gizziello\" or \"heb ceilliau\", was born in Arpino in 1714.\n\nAttractions include the circuit walls in polygonal masonry. These walls include an example of an ogive arch.\nBelow Arpino, in the Liri valley, a little north of the Isola del Liri, lies the church of S. Domenico, which marks the site of the villa in which Cicero was born and frequently resided. Near it is an ancient bridge, of a road which crossed the Liris to Cereatae (modern Casamari).\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "1891135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891135", "title": "Ariwara no Narihira", "text": "Ariwara no Narihira\n\nThere are 87 poems attributed to Narihira in court anthologies, though some attributions are dubious. Narihira's poems are exceptionally ambiguous; the compilers of the 10th-century \"Kokin Wakashū\" thus treated them to relatively long headnotes.\n\nNarihira's many renowned love affairs have exerted a profound influence on later Japanese culture. Legends have held that he had affairs with the high priestess of the Ise Grand Shrine and the poet Ono no Komachi, and that he fathered Emperor Yōzei. His love affairs inspired \"The Tales of Ise\", and he has ever since been a model of the handsome, amorous nobleman.\n\nAriwara no Narihira was born in 825. He was a grandson of two emperors: Emperor Heizei through his father, Prince Abo; and Emperor Kanmu through his mother, Princess Ito. He was the fifth child of Prince Abo, but was supposedly the only child of Princess Ito, who lived in the former capital at Nagaoka. Some of Narihira's poems are about his mother.\n\nAbo was banished from the old capital Heijō-kyō (modern Nara) to Tsukushi Province (within modern Fukuoka) in 824 due to his involvement in a failed coup d'état known as the Kusuko Incident. Narihira was born during his father's exile. After Abo's return to Heijō, in 826, Narihira and his brothers Yukihira, Nakahira and were made commoners and given the surname \"Ariwara\". The scholar Ōe no Otondo was also a brother of Narihira's.\n\nAlthough he is remembered mainly for his poetry, Narihira was of high birth and served at court. In 841 he was appointed Lieutenant of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards, before being promoted to Lieutenant of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards and then Chamberlain. In 849, he held the Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade.\n\nNarihira rose to the positions of Provisional Assistant Master of the Left Military Guard, Assistant Chamberlain, Provisional Minor Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards, Captain of the Right Division of the Bureau of Horses, Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards, Provisional Governor of Sagami, reaching the Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade. By the end of his life he had risen to Chamberlain and Provisional Governor of Mino.\n\nLiterary historian and critic Donald Keene observed in his description of Narihira as the protagonist of \"The Tales of Ise\":\n\nNarihira combined all the qualities most admired in a Heian courtier: he was of high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. He was probably also an expert horseman, adept in arms, and a competent official. These aspects of his life are not emphasized in \"The Tales of Ise\", but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.\n\nNarihira was known as a great lover; a third of his poems included in the \"Kokin Wakashū\" (\"Kokinshū\") describe his various romantic affairs, and after his death the national history \"Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku\" (compiled 901) said of him: \"Narihira was elegant and of handsome appearance, but he was unrestrained in his self-indulgence.\"\n\n\"The Tales of Ise\" portrays Narihira as falling in love with , a consort of Emperor Seiwa, and it is hinted that this was one of the reasons for his leaving the capital and travelling east. It has been speculated that this romantic affair with the consort of the emperor was the reason why the \"Sandai Jitsuroku\" describes his rank as going down from Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade to Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade, before again rising to Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade the following year. However, it has also been speculated that this may be an error in the \"Sandai Jitsuroku\" as a result of binding changing the order of events. Furthermore, Fujiwara no Takaiko reputedly had an affair with the monk , which may have formed the core of the otherwise fictional legend that she also had an affair with Narihira. Whether the affair was historical or not, the Reizei family's commentary on \"The Tales of Ise\" speculates that Emperor Yōzei was a product of this union, and not the previous emperor.\n\nOne of Narihira's most famous affairs—the one that gave \"The Tales of Ise\" its name—was said to be with , high priestess of the Ise Grand Shrine and daughter of Emperor Montoku. \"The Tales of Ise\" describes the protagonist, presumed to be Narihira, visiting Ise on a hunt, and sleeping with the priestess. However, a passage in the \"Kokinshū\" describes the meeting ambiguously, in a manner that implies Narihira did not sleep with the priestess herself but rather another woman in her service. The 12th-century work and the 13th-century work \"Kojidan\" claim that the product of this union was , who was later adopted by . Japanologist Helen Craig McCullough stated there was \"no evidence\" the affair between Narihira and Yasuko was \"more than a romantic myth\".\n\nA headnote to poems 784 and 785 in the \"Kokinshū\" connects Narihira to the daughter of . Medieval commentaries call her Narihira's wife, and some modern scholars, such as Katagiri, do the same, although the only early source that explicitly names her is the note in the \"Kokinshū\". In the classical Noh play \"Izutsu\", an adaptation by Zeami Motokiyo of from \"The Tales of Ise\", portrays Narihira and Ki no Aritsune's daughter as childhood playmates who eventually marry; Narihira is unfaithful to his wife, and her pining spirit appears to a monk after their deaths.\n\nIt has been speculated, based in part on their being considered the most beautiful man and woman of their age, that Narihira and the poet Ono no Komachi may have been lovers, but there is little evidence for this. Scholars of the 20th century such as have held up this speculation, which can be traced back at least as far as the 14th-century historian Kitabatake Chikafusa.\n\nChikafusa likely used Kamakura period \"Kokinshū\" commentaries such as the extant , which speculates that one of Komachi's poems was left for Narihira after a tryst. The \"Bishamondō-bon Kokinshū-chū\" in turn likely worked from a then-common belief that fictional \"Tales of Ise\" was a genuine historical work detailing the actual events in Narihira's life (see above). Kamakura period commentaries on \"The Tales of Ise\" therefore tried to insert the names of real women where the original text simply said \"a woman\", and thus inserted Ono no Komachi into several passages of the text.\n\nThe literary scholar Yōichi Katagiri concluded, on the lack of surviving evidence, that, while it is possible that Narihira and Ono no Komachi knew each other and were lovers, there was no usable evidence to say conclusively either way.\n\nThe \"Kokinshū\", \"Tales of Ise\" and \"Tales of Yamato\" all describe Narihira leaving Kyoto to travel east through the Tōkaidō region and crossing the Sumida River, composing poems at famous places (see \"utamakura\") along the way. \"The Tales of Ise\" implies this journey was the result of the scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts as to whether this journey actually took place, from the point of view both that the number of surviving poems is quite small for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, and in terms of the historical likelihood that a courtier could have gone wandering to the other end of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.\n\nAccording to the \"Sandai Jitsuroku\", Narihira died on 9 July 880 (the 28th day of the fifth month of Tenchō 6 on the Japanese calendar). Poem 861 in the \"Kokinshū\", Narihira's last, expresses his shock and regret that his death should come so soon:\n\nThe location of Narihira's grave is uncertain. In the Middle Ages he was considered a deity (\"kami\") or even an avatar of the Buddha Dainichi, and so it is possible that some what have been called graves of Narihira's are in fact sacred sites consecrated to him rather than places where he was actually believed to have been buried. Kansai University professor and scholar of \"The Tales of Ise\" has speculated that the small stone grove on Mount Yoshida in eastern Kyoto known as may be such a site. He further speculated that the site became associated with Narihira because it was near the grave-site of Emperor Yōzei, who in the Middle Ages was widely believed to have secretly been fathered by Narihira. Another site traditionally believed to house Narihira's grave is in western Kyoto, which is also known as .\n\nAmong Narihira's children were the \"waka\" poets () and (), and at least one daughter. Through Muneyama, he was also the grandfather of the poet Ariwara no Motokata. One of his granddaughters, whose name is not known, was married to Fujiwara no Kunitsune and engaged in a clandestine affair with Taira no Sadafun.\n\nNarihira is also known by the nicknames , and . \"Zai\" is the Sino-Japanese reading of the first character of his surname \"Ariwara\", and \"Go\", meaning \"five\", refers to him and his four brothers Yukihira, Nakahira, Morihira, and Ōe no Otondo. \"Chūjō\" (\"Middle Captain\") is a reference to the post he held near the end of his life, Provisional Middle Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards. After the recurring use of the phrase in \"The Tales of Ise\", he is also known as .\n\nNarihira left a private collection, the , which was included in the . This was likely compiled by a later editor, after the compilation of the \"Gosen Wakashū\" in the mid-10th century.\n\nThirty poems attributed to Narihira were included in the early 10th-century \"Kokinshū\", and many more in later anthologies, but the attributions are dubious. Ki no Tsurayuki mentioned Narihira in his \"kana\" preface to the \"Kokinshū\" as one of the Six Poetic Geniuses—important poets of an earlier age. He was also included in Fujiwara no Kintō's later Thirty-Six Poetic Geniuses.\n\nOf the eleven poems the \"Gosen Wakashū\" attributed to Narihira, several were really by others—for example, two were actually by Fujiwara no Nakahira and one by Ōshikōchi no Mitsune. The \"Shin Kokinshū\" and later court anthologies attribute more poems to Narihira, but many of these were likely misunderstood to have been written by him because of their appearance in \"The Tales of Ise\". Some of these were probably composed after Narihira's death. Combined, poems attributed to Narihira in court anthologies total 87.\nThe following poem by Narihira was included as No. 17 in Fujiwara no Teika's \"Ogura Hyakunin Isshu\":\n\nAlthough at least some of the poems attributed to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, there is a large enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable \"Kokinshū\" for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style. Narihira made use of \"engo\" (related words) and \"kakekotoba\" (pivot words).\n\nThe following poem, number 618 in the \"Kokinshū\", is cited by Keene as an example of Narihira's use of \"engo\" related to water:\nThe \"water\" engo are ' (\"brooding\", but a pun on ' \"long rain\"), ' (\"a river of tears\") and ' (\"is soaked\").\n\nNarihira's poems are exceptionally ambiguous by \"Kokinshū\" standards, and so were treated by the anthology's compilers to relatively long headnotes. He was the only poet in the collection to receive this treatment. An example of Narihira's characteristic ambiguity that Keene cites is \"Kokinshū\" No. 747:\nScholars have subjected this poem, Narihira's most famous, to several conflicting interpretations in recent centuries. The Edo-period \"kokugaku\" scholar Motoori Norinaga interpreted the first part of it as a pair of rhetorical questions, marked by the particle \"ya\". He explained away the logical inconsistency with the latter part of the poem that his reading introduced by reading in an \"implied\" conclusion that though the poet remains the same as before, everything somehow feels different. The late-Edo period \"waka\" poet took a different view, interpreting the \" as exclamatory: the moon and spring are not those of before, and only the poet himself remains unchanged.\n\nA similar problem of interpretation has also plagued Narihira's last poem (quoted above). The fourth line, \", is most normally read as \"(I never thought) that it might be yesterday or today\", but has been occasionally interpreted by scholars to mean \"until yesterday I never thought it might be today\"; others take it as simply meaning \"right about now\". But the emotion behind the poem is nonetheless clear: Narihira, who died in his fifties, always knew he must die someday, but is nonetheless shocked that his time has come so soon.\n\nTsurayuki's preface to the \"Kokinshū\" describes Narihira's poems as containing \"too much feeling and insufficient words. They are like faded flowers whose colour has been lost but which retain a lingering fragrance\". Ki no Yoshimochi repeats this in his Chinese preface to the \"Kokinshū\", though according to literary scholars Rodd and Henkenius, it may not be negative criticism, and may even \"be seen as complimentary\". It likely refers to the subjective, emotional nature of his poetry; they say that \"'insufficient' may suggest that many of his poems are misleading or unintelligible without explanatory headnotes\", and perhaps indicates that \"even though Narihira approached the art in an unconventional manner, his poetry succeeds\".\n\nKeene pointed out that this criticism likely reflected a change in literary tastes in the decades between Narihira's compositions and Tsurayuki's criticisms. His history of Japanese literature, \"Seeds in the Heart\" concluded its discussion of Narihira with the following:\n\nNarihira was not a profound poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining the grandeur of the best \"Man'yōshū\" poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the \"waka\" during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.\n\nPoet and translator Peter McMillan says the large number of Narihira's poems included in the \"Kokinshū\" and later court anthologies is an indicator of the high regard in which his poetry was held.\n\n\"The Tales of Ise\" is a collection of narrative episodes, centred on Narihira, and presenting poems he had composed, along with narratives explaining what had inspired the poems.\n\nNarihira was once widely considered the author of the work, but scholars have come to reject this attribution. Keene speculates that it is at least possible that Narihira originally composed the work from his and others' poems as a kind of inventive autobiography, and some later author came across his manuscript after his death and expanded on it. The protagonist of the work was likely modelled on him. The work itself was likely put together in something resembling its present form by the middle of 10th century, and took several decades starting with Narihira's death.\n\nThree stages have been identified in the composition of the work. The first of these stages would have been based primarily on poems actually composed by Narihira, although the background details provided were not necessarily historical. The second saw poems added to the first layer that were not necessarily by Narihira, and had a higher proportion of fiction to fact. The third and final stage saw some later author adding the use of Narihira's name, and treating him as a legendary figure of the past.\n\nThe late 11th-century refers to \"Ise\" by the variant name \"Zaigo Chūjō no Nikki\" (\"Narihira's diary\").\n\nIn later centuries Narihira has been considered the epitome of the amorous \"bel homme\", and his romantic escapades have given rise to many later legends. He and his contemporary Ono no Komachi were considered the archetypes of the beautiful man and woman of the Heian court, and appear as such in many later literary works, particularly in Noh theatre.\n\nIt is believed Narihira was one of the men who inspired Murasaki Shikibu when she created Hikaru Genji, the protagonist of \"The Tale of Genji\". \"Genji\" makes allusion to \"The Tales of Ise\" and draws parallels between their respective protagonists. Though not directly stated in the text, later commentators have interpreted \"The Tales of Ise\" as implying that Narihira's illicit union with the empress Fujiwara no Takaiko made him the true father of Emperor Yōzei; whether Murasaki interpreted the work this way is uncertain, but \"The Tale of Genji\" describes a very similar incident in which the protagonist, a former imperial prince made a commoner, has an affair with an empress and sires a son who ultimately becomes emperor as his true parentage is kept secret. Narihira appears in tales such as 35 and 36 of Book 24 of the late Heian-period \"Konjaku Monogatarishū\".\n\nAlong with his contemporary Ono no Komachi and the protagonist of \"The Tale of Genji\", Narihira figured prominently in Edo-period \"ukiyo-e\" prints and was alluded to in the \"ukiyo-zōshi\" of Ihara Saikaku.\n\nThe 16th-century warrior used Narihira and the courtly world of \"The Tales of Ise\" as an ironic reference in a poem he composed about the severed head of his defeated enemy Tachibana Nagatoshi (), the lord of Tachibana Castle in Chikuzen Province, whom he killed 10 March 1550.\n\n\n\n"}

Originally, and officially, known as the \"Monastery of Saint Mary of the Victory\" (), it was erected in commemoration of the 1385 Battle of Aljubarrota and would serve as the burial church of the 15th-century Aviz dynasty of Portuguese royalty. It is one of the best and original examples of Late Gothic architecture in Portugal, intermingled with the Manueline style.\n\nThe monastery was built to thank the Virgin Mary for the Portuguese victory over the Castilians in the battle of Aljubarrota in 1385, fulfilling a promise of King John I of Portugal. The battle put an end to the 1383–85 Crisis.\n\nIt took over a century to build, starting in 1386 and ending circa 1517, spanning the reign of seven kings. It took the efforts of fifteen architects (\"Mestre das Obras da Batalha\"), although for seven of them the title was merely honorary. The construction required an enormous effort, using extraordinary resources of men and material. New techniques and artistic styles, hitherto unknown in Portugal, were deployed.\n\nWork began in 1386 by the Portuguese architect Afonso Domingues, who continued until 1402. He drew up the plan, and many of the structures in the church and the cloister are his doing. His style was essentially Rayonnant Gothic; however, there are influences from the English Perpendicular Period. There are similarities with the façade of York Minster and with the nave and transept of Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nHe was succeeded by Huguet from 1402 to 1438. This architect, who was probably of Catalan descent, introduced the Flamboyant Gothic style. This is manifest in the main façade, the dome of the square chapter house, the Founder's Chapel, the basic structure of the Imperfect Chapels and the north and east naves of the main cloister. He raised the height of the nave to 32.46 m. By altering the proportions he made the interior of the church seem even narrower. He also completed the transept, but he died before he could finish the Imperfect Chapels.\n\nDuring the reign of Afonso V of Portugal, the Portuguese architect Fernão de Évora continued the construction between 1448 and 1477. He added the Cloister of Afonso V. He was succeeded by the architect Mateus Fernandes the Elder in the period 1480–1515. This master of the Manueline style worked on the portal of the Capelas Imperfeitas. Together with the famous Diogo Boitac he realized the tracery of the arcades in the Claustro Real. Work on the convent continued into the reign of John III of Portugal with the addition of the fine Renaissance tribune (1532) by João de Castilho. The construction came to a halt when the king decided to put all his efforts in the construction of the Jerónimos Monastery in Lisbon.\n\nThe earthquake of 1755 did some damage, but much greater damage was inflicted by the Napoleonic troops of Marshal Masséna, who sacked and burned the complex in 1810 and 1811. When the Dominicans were expelled from the complex in 1834, the church and convent were abandoned and left to fall into ruin.\n\nIn 1840, king Ferdinand II of Portugal started a restoration program of the abandoned and ruined convent, saving this jewel of Gothic architecture. The restoration would last till the early years of the 20th century. One of the last architects was master stonemason Jose Patrocinio de Sousa, responsible for rebuilding the monastery. It was declared a National Monument in 1907. In 1980 the monastery was turned into a museum.\n\nThe Batalha convent was added in 1983 by UNESCO to its list of World Heritage sites.\n\nThe convent stands apart from the town.\n\nThe western façade, facing the large square with its equestrian statue of general Nuno Álvares Pereira, is divided in three by buttresses and huge pilasters: the Founder's Chapel (\"Capelo do Fundador\"), the side wall of an aisle and the projecting portal. On the right side of this façade are the Unfinished Chapels (\"Capelas Imperfeitas\"), a separate octagonal structure added to the complex.\n\nOff the east side, next to the church choir is the Chapterhouse (\"Sala do Capitulo\"). The Cloister of King João I borders on the church and this chapterhouse. The structure continues into the cloister of King Afonso V (\"Claustro de D. Afonso V\"). On the northern side of the complex lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from the First World War.\n\nThe portal shows in the archivolt a profusion of 78 statues, divided over six rows, of Old Testament kings, angels, prophets and saints, each under a baldachin. The splays on both sides display (inferior copies of) statues of the apostles, with one standing on a chained devil. The tympanum shows Christ enthroned, sitting under a baldachin and flanked by the four Evangelists, each with his own attribute.\n\nThe church is vast and narrow (22 m) in proportion to its height (32.4 m). The nave was raised to its present height by the second architect, Huguet, altering the proportions of the church and giving it its present aspect. Its interior gives a sober and bare impression by its lack of ornaments and statues in the nave. The ribbed vaults, supported by compound piers, are closed by ornamented keystones. Light enters the church through ten stained-glass windows of the clerestory and the tall, traceried windows in the side walls and the transept and through the two rows of lanciform windows in the choir. The choir extends into two-bay transepts and consists of five apsidal chapels, with the central one projecting.\n\nBatalha probably had the first workshop for stained-glass windows in Portugal. The art was introduced to Portugal by German artists from the regions of Franconia and Nuremberg. The oldest windows date back to the end of the 1430s. But the Manueline, ogival stained-glass windows in the choir date from the 1520s and 1530s and were produced by Portuguese masters, among them Francisco Henriques. They represent scenes from the lives of Jesus and Mary: the Visitation, the Epiphany, the Flight into Egypt and the Resurrection of Christ.\n\nThe architect Mateus Fernandes and his wife are buried under a marble tomb-slab close to the portal. The tomb of the knight Martim Gonçalves de Maçada, who saved the king's life during the battle at Aljubarrota, can be found close to the Capela do Fundador.\n\nThe square Founder's Chapel () was built between 1426 and 1434 by the architect Huguet on orders of King John I to become the first royal pantheon in Portugal. It gives a perfect synthesis between Flamboyant Gothic and the English Perpendicular style, as Philippa of Lancaster had brought along a few English architects. The chapel consists of three notional bays and a central octagon buttressed by eight piers, adorned with crockets, supporting deeply stilted arches.\n\nThe joint tomb of King John I of Portugal (d.1433) and his wife Philippa of Lancaster (d.1415) stands under the star vault of the octagon. Their statues lie in full regalia, with clasped hands (expressing the good relations between Portugal and England) and heads resting on a pillow, under elaborately ornamented baldachins. The coats of arms of the houses of Aviz and Lancaster are on top of these baldachins, together with the insignia of the Order of the Garter. On the cover plate of the tomb are inscribed in repetition the mottos of the king \"Por bem\" (\"for the better\") and of the queen \"Yl me plet\" (\"I am pleased\").\n\nThis octagon is surrounded by an ambulatory with complex vaulting. At the south wall stand a row of recessed arches with the tombs of the four younger sons of John I, together with their spouses. From left to right: Ferdinand the Holy Prince (a bachelor, he died a prisoner in Fez in 1443; his bodily remains were later recovered and moved here in 1473); John of Reguengos, the Constable of Portugal (d.1442), with his wife Isabella of Barcelos (d.1466); Henry the Navigator (under a baldachin, d.1460, a bachelor); and Peter of Coimbra (regent for Afonso V, 1438–1448, who was killed at the Battle of Alfarrobeira in 1449; his remains were moved here in 1456) with his wife Isabella of Urgell (d.1459).\n\nThe three tombs on the west wall are copies of the original tombs of King Afonso V (r.1438–1481), John II (r.1481–1495) (empty because Masséna's soldiers threw away the bones) and his son and heir, Prince Afonso (who died in an accident at the age of seventeen, predeceasing his father).\n\n\"As Capelas Imperfeitas\" (\"The Unfinished Chapels\") are a reminder that the monastery was never actually finished. They form a separate octagonal structure tacked on the choir of the church (via a retrochoir) and only accessible from the outside. It was commissioned in 1437 by King Edward of Portugal (\"Dom Duarte\", d.1438) as a second royal mausoleum for himself and his descendants. But he and his queen Eleanor of Aragon are the only ones buried here. (Eleanor died in exile in Toledo in 1445; her remains were moved here in 1456.)\nThe original design, begun by Huguet, was altered by successive architects, especially Mateus Fernandes (who is buried inside the church). The octagonal rotunda has seven radiating hexagonal chapels. In the corners of the chapels stand the massive unfinished buttresses that were intended to support the vault. These pillars, designed by Diogo Boitac, are decorated with Manueline motives carved in stone.\n\nThe portal rises to a monumental fifteen metres. It was originally built in Gothic style, but was transformed beyond recognition by Mateus Fernandes into a masterpiece of Manueline style (completed in 1509). It is completely decorated into a lacework of sumptuous and stylized Manueline motives: armillary, spheres, winged angels, ropes, circles, tree stumps, clover-shaped arches and florid projections. This homage of King Manuel I to his predecessor King Edward mentions his motto \"Leauté faray tam yaserei\" (\"I will always be loyal\"). This motto is then repeated more than two hundred times in the arches, vaults and pillars of the chapels.\n\nThe Renaissance loggia, added at about 1533, was probably meant for musicians. It is ascribed to the architect João de Castilho.\n\nThe Chapterhouse () reminds visitors of the military reason for the monastery's foundation: a military honor guard of two sentinels stands watch over the tombs of two unknown soldiers killed in World War I.\n\nThis square room is especially notable for its star vault lacking a central support and spanning a space of 19 square meters. This was such a daring idea at the time that condemned prisoners were used to perform the task. It was completed after two failed attempts. When the last scaffolds were removed, it is said that Huguet spent the night under the vault to silence his critics.\n\nThe stained-glass Renaissance window in the east wall dates from 1508. It depicts scenes of the Passion and is attributed to the Portuguese painters Master João and Francisco Henriques.\n\nThe Royal Cloister () was not part of the original project. It was built under the architect Fernão de Évora between 1448 and 1477. Its sober outward appearance is in stark contrast with the Flamboyant Gothic style of the church. The carved tracery decoration in Gothic style (including quatrefoils, fleurs-de-lis and rosettes) by Huguet in the ambulatory forms a successful combination with the Manueline style in the arcade screens, added later by Mateus Fernandes. Two different patterns alternate, one with the cross of the Order of Christ, the other with armillaries.\n\nThe colonettes, supporting these intricate arcade screens, are decorated with spiral motives, armillaries, lotus blossoms, briar branches, pearls and shells and exotic vegetation.\n\nSituated in the northwestern corner of the \"Claustro Real\", this work of Mateus Fernandes consists of a fountain and two smaller basins above, illuminated by light seeping through the intricate tracery of the arches around it.\n\nThis sober cloister next to the \"Claustro Real\" was built in conventional Gothic style with double pointed arches. It was constructed in the second half of the 15th century by the architect Fernão de Évora. It stands in contrast with the Manueline flamboyance of the somewhat larger \"Claustro Real\". The keystones in the vault carry the coat-of-arms of D. Duarte I and Afonso V.\n\n\n"}

He earned a Bachelor of Natural Sciences degree from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1844. He joined the New York Geological Survey as an assistant chemist, was promoted in 1849 to principal chemist, and remained in this position until 1852. He earned his medical degree from Albany Medical College in 1850, and a Master's degree from Schenectady College in 1852. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1862.\n\nSalisbury served as a physician during the American Civil War, and became convinced that diarrhea suffered by the troops could be controlled with a diet of coffee and lean chopped beefsteak. \n\nSalisbury was one of the earliest health food faddists and taught that diet was the main determinant of health. He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.\n\nThe Salisbury steak, his means of achieving this goal, is ground beef flavored with onion and seasoning and then deep-fried or boiled and covered with gravy or brown sauce. It was introduced in 1888. Salisbury saw beef as an excellent defense against many different physical problems. He suggested that Salisbury steak should be eaten three times a day, with lots of hot water to cleanse the digestive system. He was an early American proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet for weight loss, and he promoted his diet for that purpose. His diet became known as the \"Salisbury diet\". It has been described as an early example of a fad diet. The Salisbury diet was promoted by Elma Stuart in her book \"What Must I do to Get Well?\", that went through at least 32 editions.\n\nSalisbury steak is similar to a number of other dishes made of ground beef. Its name caught on partly because World War I inspired a movement in English-speaking nations to avoid German-sounding terms such as \"hamburger\".\n\nSalisbury died aged 82 at his country home in Dobbs Ferry, New York and was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n\n"}

Arochukwu is a principal historic town in Igbo land. It was also one of the cities in the Southern protectorate targeted by the British colonial government. Several historic tourist sites exist in the city. The mystic Ibini Ukpabi shrine, the slave routes and other relics of the slave trade era are frequently visited by tourists. It is also in the food belt of Abia state where most of the staple foods are produced.\n\nArochukwu is believed to have been the homeland of the Ibibio as they arrived in 300 AD from the Benue valley and founded early states like Obong Okon Ita and Ibom. Many years passed as Igbo immigrants came along and pressed into the Ibibio occupied territory and founded several states. The first Igbo group were the Ezeagwu group from Enugu led by their leader Agwu Inobia. As Aro-Ibibio wars occurred, there was a stalemate. In reaction, the Eze Agwu clan invited a priest named Nnachi from the Edda clan of northeastern Igboland and another group from the east of the Cross River through Nnachi. These people were identified as the Akpa people. Akpa forces led by Osim and Akuma Nnubi, they helped the Igbo forces capture the rest of the area. This formed the alliance of 19 new and old states in the area known as the Arochukwu kingdom around 1650–1700. The first king (or Eze Aro) of a unified Arochukwu was Akuma but after his death, Nnachi son's Oke Nnachi took over and his descendants have the throne to this day.\n\nBy the mid-18th century, Arochukwu people founded many other communities both within and outside Igboland. These migrations, influence of their god Ibini Ukpabi through priests, and their military power backed up by alliances with several related neighboring Igbo and eastern Cross River militarized states (particularly Ohafia, Abam, Abiriba, Afikpo, Ekoi, etc.) quickly established the Aro Confederacy as a regional economic power. However, Aro economic hegemony was threatened by the penetration of Europeans, mainly British colonists in the wake of the 20th century. Tensions finally led to bloodshed and the Anglo-Aro War took place from 1901–1902. The Aro Confederacy stoutly resisted but were eventually defeated. This helped the British to occupy the rest of what is now known as Eastern Nigeria.\n\nThe kingdom is Igbo mixed with Ibibio and Akpa.

{"id": "1891183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891183", "title": "Hungarian State Railways", "text": "Hungarian State Railways\n\nHungarian State Railways () is the Hungarian national railway company, with divisions \"MÁV START Zrt.\" (passenger transport), \"MÁV-Gépészet Zrt.\" (maintenance) and \"MÁV-Trakció Zrt.\". The \"MÁV Cargo Zrt\" (freight transport) was sold to Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) in 2007. The head office is in Budapest.\n\nThe first steam locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846 between Pest and Vác. This date is regarded as the birth date of the Hungarian railways. The Romantic poet Sándor Petőfi, later a leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, rode on the first train and wrote an occasional poem, predicting that rails would connect Hungary like blood vessels in the human body.\n\nAfter the failed revolution, the existing lines were nationalized by the Austrian State and new lines were built. As a result of the Austro-Sardinian War in the late 1850s, all these lines were sold to Austrian private companies. During this time the company of Ábrahám Ganz invented a method of \"crust-casting\" to produce cheap yet sturdy iron railway wheels, which greatly contributed to railway development in Central Europe.\n\nFollowing the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 that created the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary, transport issues became the responsibility of the Hungarian Government, which also inherited the duty to support local railway companies. This came at a considerable cost: in the 1874 fiscal year 8% of the annual budget went to railway company subsidies. This led the Hungarian Parliament to consider founding a State Railway in 1868.\n\nThe goal was to take over and operate the Hungarian main lines. The branch lines were constructed by private companies. When the law in 1884 provided a simplified way to create Railway Companies many small branch line companies were founded. These, however, usually only constructed the lines, then made a contract with MÁV to operate them. Thus they also owned no locomotives or other rolling stock. MÁV made a contract only if the line, its equipment and buildings were constructed to MÁV standards. This helped to build standard station buildings, sheds, and accessories, all to the MÁV rules.\n\nBecause of relatively high prices the traffic density was considerably lower in Hungary than in other countries. To change this the Interior Minister, Gábor Baross, introduced the zone tariff system in 1889. This system resulted in lower prices for passenger trips and goods transport but it induced a rapid increase in both and so higher overall profits. In 1891 the Hungarian lines of the StEG were bought by the Hungarian State directly from the French owners and became MÁV lines.\n\nIn 1890 most large private railway companies were nationalized as a consequence of their poor management, except the strong Austrian-owned Kaschau-Oderberg Railway (KsOd) and the Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway (SB/DV). They also joined the zone tariff system, and remained successful until the end of World War I when Austria-Hungary collapsed.\n\nBy 1910 MÁV had become one of the largest European railway companies, in terms of both its network and its finances. Its profitability, however, always lagged most Western European companies, be they publicly or privately owned. The Hungarian railway infrastructure was largely completed in these years, with a topology centred on Budapest that still remains.\n\nBy 1910, the total length of the rail networks of the Hungarian Kingdom reached , the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half (52%) of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania. This has ranked Hungarian railways the 6th most dense in the world (ahead of countries as Germany or France).\n\nIn 1911 a new locomotive numbering system was introduced which was used until the beginning of the 21st century and is still in use for motive power purchased before then. The notation specifies the number of driven axles and the maximum axle load of the locomotive.\nDespite the Hungarian factories were independent companies, the largest suppliers of MÁV were the MÁVAG company in Budapest (steam engines and wagons) and the Ganz company in Budapest (steam engines, wagons, the production of electric locomotives and electric trams started from 1894). and the RÁBA Company in Győr.\n\nThe Ganz Works identified the significance of induction motors and synchronous motors commissioned Kálmán Kandó (1869–1931) to develop it. In 1894, Kálmán Kandó developed high-voltage three-phase AC motors and generators for electric locomotives. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system. The first Ganz made asynchronous rail vehicles (altogether 2 pieces) were supplied in 1898 to Évian-les-Bains (Switzerland), with a , asynchronous-traction system. The Ganz Works won the tender of electrification of railway of Valtellina Railways in Italy in 1897. Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line, rather than just a short stretch. The Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The electrical system was three-phase at 3 kV 15 Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier, and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices. In 1918, Kandó invented and developed the rotary phase converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high voltage national networks.\n\nAt the end of World War I, after the peace treaty of Trianon that reduced Hungarian territory by 72%, the railway network was cut from around (the long MÁV-owned network decreased to ). The number of freight cars was 102,000 at the end of World War I, but after 1921 only 27,000 remained in Hungary, of which 13,000 were in working order. The total number of locomotives was 4,982 in 1919, but after the peace treaty, only 1,666 remained in Hungary. As many existing railway lines crossed Hungary's new borders, most of these branch lines were abandoned. On the main lines, new border stations had to be constructed with customs facilities and locomotive service.\n\nBetween the world wars, development focused on existing multiple-track lines and adding a second track to most main lines. An electrification process started, based on Kálmán Kandó's patent on a single-phase 16 kV 50 Hz AC traction and his newly designed MÁV Class V40 locomotive, which used a rotary phase converter unit to transform the catenary high voltage current into multiphase current with regulated low voltage that fed the single multi-phase AC induction traction motor. Most main lines' cargo and passenger trains were hauled by the MÁV Class 424 steam locomotive, which became the MÁV's workhorse in the late steam era. From 1928 onwards 4- and 6-wheeled gasoline (and later diesel) railcars were purchased (Class BCmot) and by 1935 57% of branch lines were served by railcars. The rest of MÁV's passenger network remained steam based with slow pre-war locomotives and 3rd class \"wooden bench\" carriages (called in Hungarian, a name nowadays applied to low cost airlines).\n\nIn the early 1930s, almost all Hungarian branch line operators went bankrupt because of the Great Depression. DSA, the Hungarian successor to the former Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway, went into receivership. MÁV took over DSA's branch lines and all property in 1932 and continued to operate them. MÁV thus became the only major railway operator in Hungary, the impact of the few other independent railway companies (GySEV, AEGV) being negligible.\n\nDuring late World War II the Hungarian railway system suffered tremendous destruction. More than half the main lines and a quarter of the branch lines were inoperable. 85% of all bridges were destroyed, 28% of all buildings were ruined and another 32% of them inoperable. The rolling stock was either destroyed or distributed to many other European countries. Only 213 locomotives, 120 railcars (there was no fuel in the last days of the war to move them away), 150 passenger cars and 1,900 freight cars were in working order. These were prized and signed as \"trophies\" by the Soviet Red Army.\n\nAfter World War II the track, buildings and service equipment were repaired with tremendous efforts in relatively short time. By 1948 most of the railway system was operable, some larger bridges needing more time to be rebuilt. The first electrified section was already in use by October 1945. The Red Army sold back the confiscated rolling stock and locomotives were returned from Austria and Germany. To accelerate reconstruction MÁV purchased 510 USATC S160 Class locomotives which became MAV Class 411.\n\nIn the 1950s, an accelerated industrialization was ordered by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the railway was considered a backbone of these efforts. Overloaded trains were hauled by badly maintained locomotives on poor quality tracks. Unrealistic Five Year Plans were specified; not fulfilling them was considered sabotage. After accidents, railway workers were given show trials and sometimes even sentenced to death.\n\nAll the time the production of steam locomotives continued, but at first in small numbers, as the Hungarian industry was fully booked producing Soviet war reparations. This included steam locomotives to Soviet designs, passenger and freight cars, and many other goods. The development of diesel locomotives started. The successor of the Kandó V40 locomotives, the Class V55 proved to be a failure and MÁV decided to purchase no more phase converter engines.\n\nDuring the 1956 Hungarian Revolution the railways were not seriously damaged. After the suppressed Revolution the system of Five-Year Plans was reintroduced but with lower targets. In 1958 steam locomotive manufacturing stopped in Hungary. 600 HP diesel-electric locomotives (Class M44) and 450 HP diesel hydraulic switchers (Class M31) were manufactured.\n\nBy 1964, the German-designed, domestically-built MÁV Class V43 four-axle 25 kV AC 50 Hz electric locomotive entered service and eventually some 450 of this reliable engine became the workhorse of MÁV traction in passenger as well as freight service. Heavy diesel engines arrived from the USSR (M62) and Sweden/United States (M61). Track maintenance, however, always remained poor, preventing the rolling stock from using the system to its fullest.\n\nTo this day (particularly ) remains the top speed for trains in Hungary, though EU funds have become available to upgrade the network, especially tracks of the Trans-European Transport Networks. (Since Hungary lies in Central Europe, many important railway lines go through the country.) During the 1990s the state-owned MÁV gradually abandoned its most rural routes, but large scale passenger service cuts were blocked by political pressure. Still, the quality of general passenger service deteriorated considerably since Hungary converted to capitalism, as MÁV became focused on the more profitable cargo business. Relatively few people have access to the higher-quality \"Intercity\" express trains because of the unbalanced topography of the Hungarian railway network. Further expansion is also hampered by the shortage of high-quality passenger carriages.\n\nAs the post-2000 Hungarian political establishment became very much focused on the perceived \"autobahn-gap\" compared to better-routed Slovakia and especially Croatia and decided to upgrade the highway system, there was no significant domestic funding for developing the Hungarian Railway especially for the small regional lines. Recent developments include the purchase of twelve Siemens Desiro diesel railbuses for commuter routes and the order for Swiss Stadler Flirts, a type of very advanced electric self-propelled train for medium range shuttle paths, which is mired in a selection scandal against Bombardier's more established, but conservatively engineered Talent trains.\n\nThe GySEV Győr–Sopron–Ebenfurti Vasút Rt. line (connecting two Hungarian and one Austrian city) is managed jointly by the two states.\n\nIn 2006 the government was elected for promises, among those are making the lines between cities double-tracked, electrified, and validated for 160 km/h (by this transferring highway-cargo of companies to more environment-friendly, faster and greater capacity transportation). This was supposed to be done by first building the new track then building the remaining one in the place of the original one. The only possible way to finance the project was with the help of EU funds. EU supervision revised the plans and the projected cost but this delayed starting. During construction, the actual billings were also checked. Because of the delay and the lengthy construction works, most of the lines are still not opened in the planned state. The building works are largely forgotten by public consciousness because of the following:\n\nOn 7 December 2006, as part of a broader economic restriction package, the Hungarian government announced its intention to stop operation on 14 regional lines with a total length of . The government, referring to an obligation under the constitution, ensured access to public transit in all settlements by installing bus routes and buses from Volánbusz Mass-Transit Company. This in cases when single railway stations served multiple villages, meant bus stations were established in the centers or ends of each settlement. This and increasing frequency theoretically can be done while eliminating the high fuel (diesel or electricity) consumption of the trains and their maintenance cost.\n\nThe first plans of János Kóka, Minister of the Economy and Transport, were more radical, abandoning 26 lines (or 12% of the entire network), but they were met with strong opposition from the local municipalities, parliamentary opposition parties and civic organizations. The main opposition party claimed that these measures were directed against more rural areas, especially small villages. The issue was heavily politicized. People considered the buses less safe or fast, especially in winter. Since the government wanted to avoid costly environmental protection and recultivation regulations, the railway lines will not be formally ceased, with the tracks removed, just the service suspended indefinitely. However, because of widespread scrap metal theft in Hungary, this effectively means the tracks are written off.\n\nOn 4 March 2007 service was suspended on 14 lines: Pápa–Környe, Pápa–Csorna, Zalabér–Zalaszentgrót, Lepsény–Hajmáskér, Sellye–Villány, Diósjenő–Romhány, Kisterenye–Kál–Kápolna, Mezőcsát–Nyékládháza, Kazincbarcika–Rudabánya, Nyíradony–Nagykálló, Békés–Murony, Kunszentmiklós–Dunapataj, Fülöpszállás–Kecskemét and Kiskőrös–Kalocsa. Many of these have since been reopened by the new government.\n\nOn 20 April 2007, the Index news web portal published material from internal MÁV studies, which indicated the new company leadership and the government intend to close \"all\" small regional railway lines after 2008, to eliminate sources of reincurring unfinanced expenses at MÁV (the to-be-closed lines' expenses are ten times as large as their incomes). This would leave only the international railway lines and large rural-to-town routes running.\n\nHowever, in 2010, when Fidesz returned to power, the new government announced that they would undo a plethora of transportation decisions made by the socialists. Ten rural railway lines, previously closed with the reason of low revenues, were reopened with much fanfare. The government states both bus and railway system have to be developed, and most settlements shouldn't be limited to have only one type of station.\n\nIn February 2013, for the first time in its history, the railway started to train women drivers. The Times quoted a spokesman as saying that since there are no steam trains, there is no need for heavy lifting.\n\nMÁV-Start entered into a framework contract with Stadler in 2017 for the purchase of a maximum of 40, 6-train unit motor trains, of which 11 will be the first installments. The wagon body and bogie of the motor trains is assembled in Szolnok, the non-driven middle wagon section and the final assembly of the trains take place at the Dunakeszi Vehicle Repair, so the domestic production rate of the trains will be more than 50%. In 2018, MÁV-Start called for an additional 8 motor trains, and in 2019, preparations for drawing up the remaining 21 began. Trains will run on the Budapest-Cegléd-Szolnok and Budapest-Szob railway lines from 2020, both of which are the busiest in the country.\n\nOn 16 July 2019, the first motor train, numbered 815,001, was publicly displayed.\n\nAll trains are expected to operate on the Budapest suburban lines by 2021.\n\nMany of the railway's major stations (and also numerous major stations within the Austro-Hungarian Empire now located outside Hungary) were designed by Ferenc Pfaff and opened in the late 1880s and 1890s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: The standard and broad gauge railways are operated by the State Railways and also the following narrow gauge railways: Nyíregyháza–Balsai Tisza part/Dombrád; Balatonfenyves–Somogyszentpál; Kecskemét–Kiskunmajsa/Kiskőrös and the Children's Railway in Budapest. All the other narrow gauge railways are run by State Forest companies or local non-profit organisations. See also Narrow gauge railways in Hungary. \n\n\n"}

She earned a master's degree in 1949 from University College London. Hesse lectured on mathematics at Royal Holloway College from 1947 to 1951, and at the University of Leeds from 1951 to 1955. From 1955 to 1959 she taught philosophy and history of science at the University of London (the subject of her 1949 UCL master's degree). In 1960 she was appointed to a lectureship in the same subject at the University of Cambridge, and in 1968 to a readership. Hesse was a Fellow of Wolfson College from its beginning in 1965, and served as its Vice-President from 1976 to 1980. From 1975 until her early retirement in 1985, she remained at Cambridge as Professor of Philosophy of Science.\n\nHesse was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1971, as president of the Philosophy of Science Association in 1979, and awarded a Cambridge honorary ScD in 2002.\n\nHesse's work has focused on the philosophical interpretation of logic and scientific methods, as well as to the principles of the natural and social sciences. She suggested a scientific methodology based on an analogical modelling approach. She distinguishes those models in formal and material, as well as positive, negative and neutral analog properties.\n\nHer publication \"Models and Analogies in Science\" is a widely cited and accessible introduction to the topic. Hesse argues, contra Duhem, that models and analogies are integral to understanding scientific practice in general and scientific advancement in particular, especially how the domain of a scientific theory is extended and how theories generate genuinely novel predictions. Examples of such models include the famous billiard ball model of the dynamical theory of gases and models of light based on analogies to sound and water waves.\n\nHesse thought that, in order help us understand a new system or phenomenon, we will often create an analogical model that compares this new system or phenomenon with a more familiar system or phenomenon. In her book, Hesse makes a distinction between three types of analogues in scientific models: \nPositive analogies are those features which are known or thought to be shared by both systems, negative analogies are those features which are known or thought to be present in one system but absent in the other, and neutral analogies are those features whose status as positive or negative analogies is uncertain at present.\n\nNeutral analogies are by far the most interesting of the three types of analogies, for they suggest ways to test the limits of our models, guiding the way for scientific advancement. In the late 19th century, for example, the idea that light-waves have a physical medium called the luminiferous ether would have been best thought of as a neutral analogy with water and sound waves. Eventually, due to a null result in the Michelson–Morley and Trouton–Noble experiments, as well as other similar experiments, this analogy came to be accepted as a negative analogy - we now accept that light has no physical medium, unlike sound and water waves. The discovery of this negative analogy led to further advances, including the unification of electromagnetic theory with optics, and the eventual creation of new and more informative models of light.\n\nMonographs:\n\nEssay collections:\n\n\nAcademic papers/book chapters, a selection:\n\n\n(Full Annotated Bibliography by Matteo Collodel).\n\n"}

He is considered one of the pioneering figures in defining the Asian Underground genre by mixing disparate genres of music such as Indian classical and folk with electronica, rock, pop and ambient music. In addition to production, remixing, and DJ work, Kale is known for his tabla drumming and film composition.\n\nBorn as Utkarsh Kale on 1 November 1974 to Indian Marathi speaking immigrants in West Bromwich, UK, Kale was raised in Stony Brook, New York after his parents relocated in 1977.\n\nKale took an interest in drums and eventually became a tabla player. Kale's father introduced Kale to a broad range of music, which included traditional Indian music, classical, rock, and even early hip-hop. From this broad range of influences, Kale, who was self-taught, developed his own style, which eventually led to his \"electric tabla\".\n\nIn 2000, Bill Laswell founded Tabla Beat Science, inviting Kale, along with Zakir Hussain, Talvin Singh, Trilok Gurtu and Sultan Khan. Together, the group released \"Tala Matrix\" that year. The album is considered to be one of the most influential Asian Fusion albums to date, and the group embarked on a tour, of which one of the shows was later released on DVD.\n\nWhile a Music Production and Performance student at New York University, Kale began playing in bands and working as a session musician. In 1999, Kale began work on his first EP, \"Classical Science Fiction from India\" and began hosting bi-weekly \"Futureproof\" events, which consisted of DJ and electric tabla sets.\n\nThese events attracted the attention of San Francisco label Six Degrees Records. Soon after, Kale became the first Indo-American to be signed to a solo recording contract in the United States, a move which was followed by Kale's first full-length album, \"Realize\", in 2001. \"Realize\", often considered as a major milestone in what Kale called \"Asian Massive\", was followed with 2002's Asian Massive Tour, which also featured Midival Punditz and Cheb i Sabbah, and 2003's \"Liberation\". Zakir Hussain also was featured in the album and in the major attraction of the album \"Milan\".\n\nKale's third album, 2006's \"Broken English\", was predominantly set to English lyrics, a shift from his previous albums. His follow-up \"Breathing Under Water\", released in 2007, was the result of a two-year collaboration with sitar instrumentalist Anoushka Shankar. In 2011, Kale released \"Cinema\", which is influenced by Kale's experiences in composing for Bollywood. He also won GIMA Awards best fusion album for the same, beating A.R.Rahman.\n\nKale has composed for crossover and Bollywood films including Chutney Popcorn, Indian Cowboy, Ocean of Pearls, and Pyaar Impossible!. His tracks have also been featured in shows such as HBO's True Blood and Real Time with Bill Maher. Two of his songs were included in as sample music in Windows Vista by Microsoft.\n\nKale's songwriting credits include songs with Sting and Norah Jones, and has remixed songs by artists including Paula Cole, Yoko Ono, and The Cure. Kale also worked with Midival Punditz on a rescoring of Bruce Lee's \"Enter the Dragon\".\n\nIn 2012 Kale was one of an esteemed group of music producers selected to take part in MTV India's music incubation project: Coke Studio for its second season. Working with Indian artists including Warren Mendonsa, Monali Thakur, Benny Dayal, Apeksha Dandekar and more, he produced some of the series most innovative and well received tracks.\n\nSolo albums\n\n\n\nWith Dave Douglas\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1891203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891203", "title": "Momoe Yamaguchi", "text": "Momoe Yamaguchi\n\nMomoe Yamaguchi was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1959. Not long afterwards she was left in the care of her maternal grandparents. At around four, she returned to her parents and the family then moved to Yokohama. Without her father, a medical doctor who was already married to another women with children, having never married \"her\" mother. The family moved once again to Yokosuka. Her mother raised Momoe and her younger sister Toshie by herself. Toshie Yamaguchi studied in the states from part of high school to college while Momoe made a life in Japan. Momoe has a niece in the US who she has never met. \n\nYamaguchi began a career in show business while she was still a student in junior high school. At the end of 1972, at the age of 13, Yamaguchi, along with many of her schoolmates, applied by postcard to appear on the idol talent search television show \"Star Tanjō!\". After a series of successful preliminary auditions, she appeared on the show covering a hit song \"Kaiten Mokuba\", by Yumi Makiba earlier that year. Though she finished second, Yamaguchi received offers from several music producers, and signed with Hori Productions. Her family moved to Tokyo. Yamaguchi transferred to Shinagawa Joshi Gakuin, and then attended Hinode Joshi Gakuin High School, a school which allows its students to carry on careers in show business.\n\nInitially she was promoted together with two other singers, Junko Sakurada and Masako Mori, as the \"Hana no Chūsan Torio\" (meaning \"The lovely trio of third-year middle school students\") since they were all in the third year of middle school (\"chūsan\").\n\nHer first single, \"Toshigoro\", coupled with her first movie of the same title, did not fare well in the charts, peaking at 37 on the Oricon singles chart. But her second single \"Aoi Kajitsu\" peaked at number 9. Japanese pop culture historians have credited its success to its suggestive lyrics. The chorus goes \"You can do what ever you want with me; it's OK if rumors spread that I'm a bad girl\".\n\nHer early songs were written for her by the Hori Productions songwriting team of composer Shunichi Tokura and lyricist Kazuya Senge. One of her biggest hits was her 5th single \"Hito natsu no Keiken\" (\"an experience one summer\"), which includes lyrics like \"I'll give you the most precious thing a girl has\". and \"Everyone experiences it at least once, the sweet trap of seduction\". The suggestive lyrics attracted widespread press interest. The young singer was frequently asked salacious questions such as \"What do you think a girl's most precious thing is?\", to which she replied \"magokoro\" (\"her devotion\").\n\nBy the end of 1974, her phenomenal popularity was demonstrated by her being invited to be the opening female singer for the 25th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, Japan's most popular musical show, with the song \"Hito Natsu No Keiken\". She would continue to appear in this show every year until her retirement.\nWith her increasing popularity, Yamaguchi gained more control over her career and was able to select her own songwriters. One of her choices was Ryudo Uzaki. She chose him because she liked his song \"Secret Love\", recorded by the Down Town Boogie Woogie Band. Their first collaboration resulted in the single \"Yokosuka Story\" in 1976, written by Uzaki with lyrics by his wife, Yoko Aki. Aki was inspired to write the song because both she and Yamaguchi, whom she had never met when the song was originally ordered, had both lived in Yokosuka. \"Yokosuka Story\" was Yamaguchi's biggest hit, selling more than 600,000 copies, and peaked at number one on the charts. This was the beginning of a collaboration with the husband and wife songwriting team which only ended with Yamaguchi's retirement. Songs were also written for her by writers such as Masashi Sada, who wrote one of her most popular hits, \"Cosmos\". \n\nHer popularity as a singer was paralleled by rising success in a series of films and television programs. Her second film, \"Izu no Odoriko\", paired her with actor Tomokazu Miura, chosen because he had previously done a commercial for Glico with her. Although Yamaguchi was 15 while Miura was 22, they had great screen chemistry, and became known as the Momoe-Tomokazu \"golden combi\". They starred together in a total of 14 of her 17 movies, one every winter and summer.\n\nAs she became popular, her father, Kubo, decided to cash in on her success. He held bogus \"press conferences\" unauthorized by either Yamaguchi or her management company, and in various ways disrupted her career. Since Yamaguchi was still a minor, he sued for the right of parental authority. The court case ended in a victory for her mother. Yamaguchi declared in her autobiographical book that she ended her relationship with her father, and would never acknowledge his existence again. She also expressed the regret that if she had not become famous, this would not have happened.\n\nBy the end of her career, Yamaguchi's music became more sophisticated. Her 12th and 18th albums, \"Golden Flight\" and \"L.A. Blue\", were recorded in London and Los Angeles respectively, using local musicians and production staff. Her 21st album, \"Phoenix Densetsu\", was written as a rock opera. Because she wanted to make a rock song before she ended her career, Uzaki and Aki wrote \"Rock 'n Roll Widow\" for her, which was included on the concept album \"Moebius's Game\". \n\nWhen her television series were broadcast in China in the 1980s, she also became hugely popular as an actress there. In China she is known as 山口百惠 (the final character is slightly different from that used in Japan), pronounced \"Shan Kou Bai Hui\". According to a 2000 poll by the \"News Station\" news magazine programme, she was the Japanese person known most widely among the Chinese.\n\nWith the on-screen romances between Yamaguchi and Tomokazu Miura, an off-screen romance grew. During a trip to Hawaii in early 1979, Miura proposed to Yamaguchi. She accepted, and she also said that she would retire from entertainment to marry him. Yamaguchi announced their relationship at a concert in October 1979, and the announcement about their marriage date and her retirement was made in March 1980. Billboard magazine stated in 1980 that the farewell concert by Momoe Yamaguchi was expected to gross $2.22 million. She performed the farewell concert at the Nippon Budokan on 5 October 1980, released her last album \"This is my trial\" on 21 October 1980, and released her last single \"Ichie\" on 19 November 1980. By the time of her retirement, Yamaguchi was responsible for over 25% of the sales at Horipro. She also wrote the lyrics to this song under the pen name \"Kei Yokosuka\", and continued to write a few songs for a while after retirement, such as Ann Lewis's \"La Saison\" from 1982.\n\nIn her autobiographical book, \"Aoi Toki\", she said that she disliked repeatedly singing the same songs. She also stated that she wanted to stop working to devote all her time to the wellbeing of her husband. She also said in an interview at the time of retirement that she did not want to continue working as a singer or an actress. \n\nOn 15 October 1980, Yamaguchi officially retired from show business, and on 19 November 1980, the pair were married. Despite several rumors of her comeback, she has devoted herself to being a homemaker and mother to two sons. Her husband, Tomokazu Miura, continued to work as an actor, even though his career up to then had mostly consisted of playing romantic leads in her films and television series.\n\nIn 1981, she wrote a book of autobiographical essays called \"Aoi Toki\", which sold over a million copies in its first month of publication.\n\nDespite her retirement, she is a regular feature in weekly entertainment magazines. Her family suffered considerable difficulty in attending school events due to television crews and photographers, who sometimes used deception to gain access. Fans have frequently been found hanging around her residence, and in at least one case a fan even broke in. In 1999, her husband, Tomokazu Miura, wrote a part-autobiography \"Hishatai\" detailing the problems the couple had faced.\n\nHer two sons, Yūtarō and Takahiro Miura, both also entered careers in entertainment. Yūtarō entered the music business under the pseudonym \"Yū\" in a now-defunct group called \"Peaky Salt\". Initially it was not known that he was Momoe and Tomokazu's son. Takahiro is an actor who has appeared in several films and television programs. Takahiro is also a qualified lifeguard because he was a swimmer and surf lifesaver from high school and university. \n\nYamaguchi's hobby is quilt making, and she exhibits her quilts under her married name, \"Momoe Miura\". \nIn 2011, she was selected in a poll as \"The ideal mother\".\n\nNew musical products continue to go on sale, such as a boxed DVD set of her appearances on television program \"Yoru No Hitto Sutajio\" (\"Evening Hit Studio\") in 2010. In a November 2011 television interview, Ryudo Uzaki said that she still receives a healthy income from record royalties. Her television dramas continue to be available on DVD, and from 2010 have been repeated daily on the TBS Channel cable television station.\n\nIn 2011, Tomokazu Miura wrote a book entitled \"Aishō\" (compatibility) explaining the secret of their happy marriage. In 2012, the couple came first for the seventh consecutive year in a poll by the Meiji Yasuda life insurance company to find \"the ideal celebrity couple\" as considered by married people in their 20s to 50s.\n\nThe following list gives the studio albums released during her career.\n\n\n\nYamaguchi released 31 singles during her career.\n\nHer songs are regularly covered by other performers. Ayako Fuji released an \"enka\" version of her hit \"Manjushaka\" in 2003. \"Cosmos\" has been covered by many artists, including its creator, Masashi Sada, as well as Akina Nakamori. \"Imitation Gold\" was covered by Tak Matsumoto with Mai Kuraki in 2003. In 2004, a tribute album \"Yamaguchi Momoe Toribyuto Thank You For ...\" appeared of Yamaguchi covers by singers such as Masaharu Fukuyama, Sowelu, and Hiromi Iwasaki. A second volume, \"Yamaguchi Momoe Toribyuto Thank You For ... Part 2\", with more covers, came out in 2005.\n\nIn the 1980s, Chinese-language versions of some of her songs, such as \"Manjushaka\" () as , or \"Rock'n'Roll Widow\" as \"\" were released by Hong Kong singer Anita Mui.\n\nIn English, in 1991 The Nolans released an album of songs entitled \"Playback Part 2\" containing well-known Yamaguchi songs with English lyrics. (The lyrics are largely newly written rather than translations of the originals, although some of the English parts of the originals are preserved.) This was re-issued as \"The Nolans Sing Momoe 2005\" in 2005. These albums were released only in Japan.\n\nRina Rahman covered her song \"Akai Unmei\" in Malay language, entitled \"Ku Ingin Bahagia\".\n\nApart from her first film \"Toshigoro\" and two concert films, all of Yamaguchi's films, from \"Izu no odiroko\" on, were romantic stories costarring Tomokazu Miura. Many of them were directed by Katsumi Nishikawa and were remakes of the director's own films. Except for \"White Love\" (set in Spain) and \"Furimukeba Ai\" (set in San Francisco), almost all of the romantic films with Miura were based on Japanese literary works.\n\n\n\nOn television, most of Yamaguchi's appearances were in a series of dramas with Ken Utsui. Each of these dramas went on for about twenty-six episodes, or half a year. Starting with \"Kao de waratte\" and going on to the so-called \"Akai Series\", in each serial drama she and Utsui played a different father and daughter. Echoing Yamaguchi's real-life family issues, all of the \"Akai\" series consisted of complex, melodramatic family circumstances such as hidden adoption (\"Akai Meiro\", \"Akai Giwaku\", \"Akai Kizuna\"), mistaken identity (\"Akai Unmei\"), murder (\"Akai Meiro\", \"Akai Unmei\") or illness (leukemia via radiation poisoning in \"Akai Giwaku\", paralysis via an accidental shooting in \"Akai Shogeki\"). \n\nSome of the serial dramas in the \"Akai\" series did not feature Yamaguchi, such as \"\" starring Yutaka Mizutani, in which she made a guest appearance in the first episode. Each of the \"Akai\" series which she appeared in, except \"Akai Meiro\", featured a title song sung by Yamaguchi herself.\n\nThe final \"Akai\" program, \"Akai Shisen\", was a two-part story starring her and Tomokazu Miura based on \"Deadline at Dawn,\" a novel by William Irish whose Japanese title is \"Akatsuki no shisen\" (). For the first time Ken Utsui appeared in it not as the father of Yamaguchi's character, but instead in a small part as a carjacking victim and pilot. It also featured cameos from Rentarō Mikuni and Gin Maeda who had starred in \"Akai Unmei\".\n\n\n\n"}

It has also produced other entertainment-related software such as ringtone applications, as well as games for other platforms such as PDAs and personal computers. EA Mobile produces games in a wide variety of genres, such as fighting games, puzzle games, and sports titles. Their most well-known products to date include \"The Sims\", \"Need for Speed\", and \"FIFA\" as well as a mobile conversion of the widely known puzzle game \"Bejeweled\", a conversion for Pocket PC of the PC game \"Worms World Party\" and their NFL, NBA, and MLB -branded games, in addition to holding the license for the mobile versions of \"Tetris\" and various \"Monopoly\" games. They have relationships with all major North American wireless service carriers, such as Sprint, Verizon, and AT&T, as well as many minor North American and some major European and Asian carriers. They have offices in Los Angeles, Montreal, London, Tokyo, Hyderabad, Honolulu, Bucharest and São Paulo.\n\nAs a publishing company in the wireless video game industry, EA Mobile's primary service is linking game developers, who generally develop the games from idea to playable software, with wireless telecommunications service providers or \"carriers\", who sell the games to their customers. To this end, they maintain strong relationships with major companies in both groups. In addition, they create, purchase, and maintain proprietary software libraries to aid developers with whom they have working relationships, a common practice among electronic game publishers. They also do the majority of the work regarding quality assurance for their games.\n\nEA Mobile was founded in 2004 by a group of EA company veterans. The group was formed/led by John Batter (General Manager) and included Linda Chaplin (head of US sales), Lincoln Wallen (CTO), John Burn (head of European sales), Jay Miller (US sales) and Mike McCabe (head of Asian sales). EA Mobile launched the division and products simultaneously in the US, Europe and Asia.\n\nIn 2006, EA Mobile expanded its footprint by acquiring JAMDAT Mobile. JAMDAT was founded by Scott Lahman and Zack Norman, two ex-Activision executives, and Austin Murray in March 2000. They were joined in November of that year by Mitch Lasky, who had also worked at Activision, who became the CEO of JAMDAT. JAMDAT went public in late 2004.\n\nOn December 9, 2005, it was announced that JAMDAT was going to be purchased by Electronic Arts for US$680 million. The acquisition occurred on February 14, 2006, and the JAMDAT name was retired.\n\nAs of November 21, 2006, the Sepulveda Center or Jamdat building (Visible from the 405 Freeway in West Los Angeles), sign has been removed from both sides of the building. KBS Realty purchased the property in June 2006, and will become the anchor tenant.\n\nAs of December 8, 2006, EA Mobile LA has been relocated to the EA Los Angeles building in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California. The same merger of offices happened in Montreal, where Jamdat Montreal moved from its Old-Montreal location to new offices one floor above EA Montreal's studios located in Place Ville-Marie (Downtown Montreal).\n\nOn August 8, 2007, it was announced that Barry Cottle will join EA Mobile as the new Senior Vice President and General Manager.\n\nIn October 2010, EA Mobile announced the acquisition of UK based iPhone and iPad games publisher 'Chillingo' for US$20 million in cash. While Chillingo publishes the popular Cut the Rope game, the deal did not include those properties.\n\nIn July 2015, Samantha Ryan became the new SVP and General Manager of EA Mobile replacing Frank Gibeau. And the following year in a restructuring across parent company, EA, she also added oversight of Maxis, and BioWare.\n\nAs of 2017, EA Mobile have an annual revenue topping almost $700 million and employees around 800 people\n\nOn May 2, 2012, \"Rock Band\" on iOS informed users that the game would no longer be playable after May 31, 2012. While EA Mobile have previously pulled games from the App Store such as \"\", they had either remained playable for anyone who had downloaded it or been free-to-play.\n\nFurther adding to the controversy was that the app was still being sold on the App Store for its full price with no warning to customers after this message was going out.\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the leader of the Homestake experiment in the 1960s-1980s, which was the first experiment to detect neutrinos emitted from the Sun; for this he shared the 2002 \nNobel Prize in Physics.\n\nDavis was born in Washington, D.C., where his father was a photographer for the National Bureau of Standards. He spent several years as a choirboy to please his mother, although he could not carry a tune. He enjoyed attending the concerts at the Watergate before air traffic was loud enough to drown out the music. His brother Warren, 14 months younger than he, was his constant companion in boyhood. He received his B.S. from the University of Maryland in 1938 in chemistry, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. He also received a master's degree from that school and a Ph.D. from Yale University in physical chemistry in 1942.\n\nDavis spent most of the war years at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah observing the results of chemical weapons tests and exploring the Great Salt Lake basin for evidence of its predecessor, Lake Bonneville.\n\nUpon his discharge from the army in 1946, Davis went to work at Monsanto's Mound Laboratory, in Miamisburg, Ohio, doing applied radiochemistry of interest to the United States Atomic Energy Commission. In 1948, he joined Brookhaven National Laboratory, which was dedicated to finding peaceful uses for nuclear power.\n\nDavis reports that he was asked \"to find something interesting to work on,\" and dedicated his career to the study of neutrinos, particles which had been predicted to explain the process of beta decay, but whose separate existence had not been confirmed. Davis investigated the detection of neutrinos by beta decay, the process by which a neutrino brings enough energy to a nucleus to make certain stable isotopes into radioactive ones. Since the rate for this process is very low, the number of radioactive atoms created in neutrino experiments is very small, and Davis began investigating the rates of processes other than beta decay that would mimic the signal of neutrinos. Using barrels and tanks of carbon tetrachloride as detectors, Davis characterized the rate of the production of argon-37 as a function of altitude and as a function of depth underground. He deployed a detector containing chlorine atoms at the Brookhaven Reactor in 1954 and later one of the reactors at Savannah River. These experiments failed to detect a surplus of radioactive argon when the reactors were operating over when the reactors were shut down, and this was taken as the first experimental evidence that neutrinos causing the chlorine reaction, and antineutrinos produced in reactors, were distinct. Detecting neutrinos proved considerably more difficult than not detecting antineutrinos. Davis was the lead scientist behind the Homestake Experiment, the large-scale radiochemical neutrino detector which first detected evidence of neutrinos from the sun.\n\nHe shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002 with Japanese physicist Masatoshi Koshiba and Italian Riccardo Giacconi for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos, looking at the solar neutrino problem in the Homestake Experiment. He was 88 years old when awarded the prize.\n\nDavis met his wife Anna Torrey at Brookhaven and together they built a 21-foot wooden sailboat, the \"Halcyon\". They had five children and lived in the same house in Blue Point, New York for over 50 years. He died in Blue Point, New York from Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1940s and 1950s Follis had teams and individual racers competing for him in his own name, most notably Jean Forestier, who won numerous races and three stages of the Tour de France in 1954-1957, finishing 4th overall in 1957 and winning the green jersey.\n\nIn 1973, the granddaughter of the founder Joseph Follis, Myriam, took over. She was married to the former employee Jean-Claude Chollet, and they ran the business until its closure in 2007. The entire production of this period were hand-crafted, made to measure steel frames and forks. Consequently, there was no serial production.

{"id": "1891244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891244", "title": "TOG1", "text": "TOG1\n\nThe Tank, Heavy, TOG 1 was a prototype British heavy tank produced in the early part of the Second World War in the expectation that battlefields might end up like those of the First World War. It was designed so it could cross churned-up countryside and trenches. A single prototype was built, and followed by an improved model (the TOG 2), but interest faded with the successful performance of another cross-country design, the Churchill tank, and the mobile war that was being fought.\n\nIn July 1939, the Special Vehicle Development Committee was drawn up for future tank designs suitable for Great War conditions under Sir Albert Gerald Stern; who had been on the original Landship Committee and head of the Tank Supply Depot during World War I. The committee included others who had been instrumental in the development of the tank during the Great War: former Director of Naval Construction, Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, General (retired) Sir Ernest Swinton, engine designer Harry Ricardo, the gearbox and transmission expert Major Walter Gordon Wilson. Unsurprisingly they got the nickname \"The Old Gang\" and the initials TOG were applied to their designs.\n\nTogether, they proposed the development of a \"heavy tank\" design, which they entrusted to another of the first tank's developers and builder of the first tank, Sir William Tritton of Foster's of Lincoln.\n\nTheir specification was comprehensive. As well as being able to operate across ground broken up by shelling and waterlogged, it was expected to resist 47-mm anti-tank guns and 105-mm field guns or howitzers at . Main armament would be a field gun mounted in the front - effective against thick reinforced concrete - and two 2-pounder guns, the latter in sponsons. For use against infantry, there would be Besa machine guns covering \"all arcs\" - one firing forward, one in each sponson, and one firing to the rear. The design was later revised with smaller sponsons containing only the Besa machine guns. To provide cover four smoke mortars were included.\n\nDesign work by Fosters began in December 1939, resulting in a wooden mock-up. Designed with trench crossing abilities to the fore and the capability to carry infantry as well, the design as built was a large hull with side doors supported on broad tracks, with a 2-pdr-gun-armed Matilda II infantry tank turret. The front plate of the hull carried the 75 mm gun and mounting as used on the French Char B1 tank. .Neither of the planned sponson designs was ever actually installed on the prototype hull\n\nIt was realised that running the track drive over the top of the hull was not necessary and work began on a follow-up design in June 1940. The prototype TOG I was delivered in October 1940. Due to the weight, electrical drive was used - the engine driving two generators connected to an electrical motor for each track. The steering wheel was connected to a potentiometer that varied the voltage to the track motors. This strained the drive and track. Due to these problems, it was converted to a hydraulic drive designed by Fluidrive Engineering, a process that took until May 1943 after which it was called TOG 1A. The fluid drive was not satisfactory either. The prototype was sent to Chobham and then seems to have disappeared into history.\n\n\n"}

Ekman is now a Catholic. Ekman is married to Birgitta Ekman and has 4 sons, Aron, Jonathan, Samuel and Benjamin.\n\nIn his youth, Ekman was a left-leaning atheist and sympathiser of Swedish Communist party KFML(r) before becoming a Christian, just before graduating from high school in 1970. He studied ethnography, history and theology at Uppsala University and in January 1979 was ordained in the Church of Sweden, returning to Uppsala University to work as the chaplain for several years. He studied for a year at Rhema Bible Training Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States and upon his return to Uppsala in 1983 founded the Charismatic Evangelist church Livets Ord. He remained pastor of the church until passing on the pastorship to Robert Ekh in 2002 to focus on international work, though he later took up the position again. He also founded Livets Ord University and Word of Life Bible School.\n\nThrough his church he has sent missionaries to Bangladesh, Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Albania, Israel and India. Word of Life is also the host for the annual Christian event \"Europe Conference.\" In the former USSR he started to preach in pentecostal churches and in stadiums. In Riga, Latvia he worked closely with Aleksej Ledyaev and the \"New Generation Church\" where he is a pastor. In almost every big city of the former USSR a Word of Life Church and a New Generation Church was established. The number of people reached with the Gospel can be estimated to be between 250,000–500,000 people. Cooperation with New Generation Church ended in March 2004 in doctrinal disagreement.\n\nIn the charismatic world, Ulf Ekman is considered to be a mentor, a spiritual father, and a pastor of pastors. Reverend Kong Hee has once claimed Ulf Ekman to be one of his mentors, and over the years they have developed a close relationship.\n\nDuring his Sunday service on 3 March 2013, Ekman informed the assembly of a major change – he, its founder and its pastor for 30 years, would resign in May and be succeeded by Joakim Lundqvist, the up–to–then youth pastor of the congregation.\n\nOn 9 March 2014, Ekman announced his and his wife's leaving Livets Ord with the intent of joining the Catholic Church. The couple described the split as mainly amicable, and Ekman explained their decision in a lengthy sermon, claiming Jesus’ appeal, in 1 Corinthians 1:10, for unity among Christians, as well as growing and more enthusiastic theological closeness to Catholic doctrine - including during a lengthy stay in Israel, where the couple took up residence in the early 2000s - as the main reasons. Earlier harsh condemnation of the Catholic Church made the decision controversial both among the Christian community and in national debate, where Ekman’s firebrand image had been debated for decades. \n\nHe indicated, that he received a confirming word of prophecy ahead of his decision from a pastor that just had attended Kenneth Copeland's Charismatic Evangelical Leadership Conference in February 2014, a Conference to which Pope Francis sent a video message through Tony Palmer urging for the protest of the Reformation to come to an end.\n\nLike many new Christian movements, Word of Life has been criticized by other Christians, but in particular by the media. Many critics claim that Word of Life's teachings about health and economic abundance created a survival of the fittest attitude, in opposition to the Christian ascetic ideal of being poor and humble. Ekman and Word of Life always responded to this criticism by saying that they strongly believed in God's promises in the Bible. Ekman claimed that a false image was created in the Swedish media on Word of Life as being against, for example, disabled persons, when the outspoken message was that God promises deliverance from sickness.\n\nEkman's theology, along with other representatives of the Word of Faith movement, was criticized for having gnostic elements. A thesis written by Kent Gunnarsson at Umeå University, published in 2004, had this claim. The opponent at the dissertation, Professor Alexander Radler, criticized Gunnarsson for a too-wide definition of Gnosticism. Radler appreciated Gunnarsson's thesis for its rich information about modern Gnosticism, but thought that Ekman's teachings could not be seen as gnostic. Ekman's own attitude against Gnosticism is negative.\n\nLater on, Ekman rarely preached the typical Word of Faith teachings. He partially criticized some of them (for example, the Jesus Died Spiritually doctrine), but also wrote and said that the ground for his preaching was the revelation in the Bible he got from first listening to teachers like Kenneth Copeland and later studying at Kenneth Hagin's school in Tulsa.\n\nEkman seems to have broadened his doctrinal horizons with studies in patristic and church history. He has now an ecumenical approach to other congregations. In 2006 the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Stockholm, Anders Arborelius, was invited to Word of Life church in Uppsala for a public discussion. Through the Livets Ord University, which is a branch of the Oral Roberts University, Ekman published a theological magazine called Keryx, containing articles from a broad, classical Christian point of view. This magazine had articles from different Christian traditions and excerpts from patristic writings. But a critical analysis of the Word of Faith movement's own teachings hasn’t been published to this day.\n\nIn 2014, Ekman and his family converted to Roman Catholicism. He claims that the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" is \"the best book he has ever read\".\n\nIn his 2015 book Den stora upptäckten. Vår väg till katolska kyrkan he claims that an important factor in his conversion to Catholicism was information about Međugorje in Herzegovina and subsequent visit to the place, where Ulf and Birgitta met with Franciscan Jozo Zovko.\n\n\n"}

Originally named Carthay Center, the neighborhood was later re-named after the famed Carthay Circle Theatre. \n\nThe neighborhood is bounded by Wilshire Boulevard to the north, Olympic Boulevard to the south, and Fairfax Avenue to the east. The neighborhood of South Carthay is located south of Olympic Boulevard.\n\nOriginally named Carthay Center, Carthay Circle was developed as an upscale residential district in 1922 by J. Harvey McCarthy, who founded the 136-acre, mainly Spanish Revival, community. No two homes are alike due to the rule that all homes had to be designed individually by an architect, and notable designers such as Irving Gill, Paul Williams and Robert Byrd contributed to the neighborhood. \n\nThe master plan for Carthay Circle was designed by leading early 20th century architects Aleck Curlett and his partner Claud Beelman (designer of MGM Studios and Downtown LA's Eastern Columbia Building) in conjunction with landscape architects Cook & Hall (Wilbur D. Cook is also noted for creating the master plan for the neighboring city of Beverly Hills).\n\nMcCarthy named the streets in honor of prominent figures of the California Gold Rush. He also planned the neighborhood around a shopping center. \n\nCarthay Circle was one of the first planned communities in Los Angeles, and the first in the city to feature underground utilities. The success of Carthay Circle served as the catalyst for the growth of the entire Mid-City area.\n\nThe main feature of the neighborhood was the Carthay Circle Theatre, the “Showplace of the Golden West,\" that opened May 18, 1926 and soon became the focal point of Carthay Center. The theater, site of film premieres including Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (their first full-length animated film) and the West Coast premiere of Gone with the Wind, inspired the community to change the name from “Carthay Center” to “Carthay Circle.” The theater was demolished in 1969 to make way for a new office complex, 1 Carthay Plaza, today known as Carthay Campus, designed in the mid-century Brutalist architectural style. A large-scale replica of Carthay Circle Theater opened in 2012 at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California.\n\n\n\"The Pioneer” is a statue by Henry Lion that was designed as part of a fountain in Carthay Circle Park. Standing about seven feet tall and weighing 512 pounds, it was installed on September 25, 1924. Also known as \"Dan the Miner\", the statue went missing in 2009. It has been stolen during a rash of robberies spawned by rising copper prices. The statue was recovered, repaired, and reinstalled in 2010.\n\nThe Carthay Circle Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ) adopting ordinance became effective on July 24, 1998. The Carthay Circle preservation plan was adopted by the City of Los Angeles on December 9, 2010. \n\nThe following architectural styles are present in the Carthay Circle HPOZ : Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial Revivial, English Tudor Revival, French Eclectic, Monterey Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival and Minimal Traditional. Objectives of the HPOZ include: Safeguarding the character of historic buildings and sites and recognizing and protecting the historic streetscape and development patterns.\n"}

Poling received the \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" Rookie of the Year award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994.\n\nPoling had two big matches in 1995, scoring wins over Ron Simmons at Hostile City Showdown and Jim Steele at \"Barbed Wire, Hoodies and Chokeslams\". At the 1996 House Party event, 911 teamed with Rey Misterio, Jr. to defeat The Eliminators in a tag team match, which would turn out to be his last match in ECW. He got involved in a brawl with Taz after the match and a feud evolved between the two, but it was scrapped as Poling left the promotion by early 1996 after a falling out backstage with Paul Heyman over the former's treatment of the ring crew.\n\nPoling wrestled in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996 and 1997, under the names Tombstone, Sledge Hammer and Big Al. Poling did not portray the Big Al who feuded with Tank Abbott in WCW in early 2000.\n\nIn 1998, Poling returned to ECW at UltraClash in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, chokeslamming Bill Wiles. Poling was then accompanied by manager Judge Jeff Jones, who proclaimed 911 to be the true giant of professional wrestling. They were then interrupted by Spike Dudley and had an impromptu match, which 911 lost in under a minute.\n\nThroughout the late 1990s, 911 appeared with the New Jersey based Jersey All Pro Wrestling promotion, winning the JAPW Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. He made an appearance at Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling \"A War Renewed\" on June 29, 2002 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, interfering on the behalf of Tod Gordon and Sabu, delivering a chokeslam to Sandman (who had just been betrayed by his partner, Bill Alfonso). At \"Hardcore Homecoming\" in 2005 he chokeslammed both Danny Doring and Roadkill. He wrestled at New York Wrestling League in 2008.\n\nPoling resides in West Creek, New Jersey and has eight children.\n\n"}

Gene activation patterns vary widely in complexity. Some are straightforward and static, such as the pattern of \"tubulin,\" which is expressed in all cells at all times in life. Some, on the other hand, are extraordinarily intricate and difficult to predict and model, with expression fluctuating wildly from minute to minute or from cell to cell. Spatiotemporal variation plays a key role in generating the diversity of cell types found in developed organisms; since the identity of a cell is specified by the collection of genes actively expressed within that cell, if gene expression was uniform spatially and temporally, there could be at most one kind of cell.\n\nConsider the gene \"wingless,\" a member of the wnt family of genes. In the early embryonic development of the model organism \"Drosophila melanogaster\", or fruit fly, \"wingless\" is expressed across almost the entire embryo in alternating stripes three cells separated. This pattern is lost by the time the organism develops into a larva, but \"wingless\" is still expressed in a variety of tissues such as the wing imaginal discs, patches of tissue that will develop into the adult wings. The spatiotemporal pattern of \"wingless\" gene expression is determined by a network of regulatory interactions consisting of the effects of many different genes such as \"even-skipped\" and \"Krüppel.\"\n\nWhat causes spatial and temporal differences in the expression of a single gene? Because current expression patterns depend strictly on previous expression patterns, there is a regressive problem of explaining what caused the first differences in gene expression. The process by which uniform gene expression becomes spatially and temporally differential is known as symmetry breaking. For example, in the case of embryonic \"Drosophila\" development, the genes \"nanos\" and \"bicoid\" are asymmetrically expressed in the oocyte because maternal cells deposit messenger RNA (mRNA) for these genes in the poles of the egg before it is laid.\nOne way to identify the expression pattern of a particular gene is to place a reporter gene downstream of its promoter. In this configuration, the promoter gene will cause the reporter gene to be expressed only where and when the gene of interest is expressed. The expression distribution of the reporter gene can be determined by visualizing it. For example, the reporter gene green fluorescent protein can be visualized by stimulating it with blue light and then using a digital camera to record green fluorescent emission.\n\nIf the promoter of the gene of interest is unknown, there are several ways to identify its spatiotemporal distribution. Immunohistochemistry involves preparing an antibody with specific affinity for the protein associated with the gene of interest. This distribution of this antibody can then be visualized by a technique such as fluorescent labeling. Immunohistochemistry has the advantages of being methodologically feasible and relatively inexpensive. Its disadvantages include non-specificity of the antibody leading to false positive identification of expression. Poor penetrance of the antibody into the target tissue can lead to false negative results. Furthermore, since immunohistochemistry visualizes the protein generated by the gene, if the protein product diffuses between cells, or has a particularly short or long half-life relative to the mRNA that is used to translate the protein, this can lead to distorted interpretation of which cells are expressing the mRNA.\n\"In situ\" hybridization is an alternate method in which a \"probe,\" a synthetic nucleic acid with a sequence complementary to the mRNA of the gene, is added to the tissue. This probe is then chemically tagged so that it can be visualized later. This technique enables visualization specifically of mRNA-producing cells without any of the artifacts associated with immunohistochemistry. However, it is notoriously difficult, and requires knowledge of the sequence of DNA corresponding to the gene of interest.\n\nA method called enhancer-trap screening reveals the diversity of spatiotemporal gene expression patterns possible in an organism. In this technique, DNA that encodes a reporter gene is randomly inserted into the genome. Depending on the gene promoters proximal to the insertion point, the reporter gene will be expressed in particular tissues at particular points in development. While enhancer-trap derived expression patterns do not necessarily reflect the actual patterns of expression of specific genes, they reveal the variety of spatiotemporal patterns that are accessible to evolution.\n\nReporter genes can be visualized in living organisms, but both immunohistochemistry and \"in situ\" hybridization must be performed in fixed tissues. Techniques that require fixation of tissue can only generate a single temporal time point per individual organism. However, using live animals instead of fixed tissue can be crucial in dynamically understanding expression patterns over an individual's lifespan. Either way, variation between individuals can confound the interpretation of temporal expression patterns.\n\nSeveral methods are being pursued for controlling gene expression spatially, temporally and in different degrees. One method is by using operon inducer/repressor system which provides temporal control of gene expression. To control gene expression spatially inkjet printers are underdevelopment for printing ligands on gel culture. Other popular method involves use of light to control gene expression in spatiotemporal fashion. Since light can also be controlled easily in space, time and degree, several methods of controlling gene expression at DNA and RNA level have been developed and are under study. For example, RNA interference can be controlled using light and also patterning of gene expression has been performed in cell monolayer and in zebrafish embryos using caged morpholino or peptide nucleic acid demonstrating the control of gene expression spatiotemporally. Recently light based control has been shown at DNA level using transgene based system or caged triplex forming oligos\n\n"}

{"id": "1891348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891348", "title": "Alien Planet", "text": "Alien Planet\n\nAlien Planet is a 94-minute docufiction, originally airing on the Discovery Channel, about two internationally built robot probes searching for alien life on the fictional planet Darwin IV. It was based on the book \"Expedition\", by sci-fi/fantasy artist and writer Wayne Douglas Barlowe, who was also executive producer on the special. It premiered on May 14, 2005.\n\nThe show uses computer-generated imagery, which is interspersed with interviews from such notables as Stephen Hawking, George Lucas, Michio Kaku and Jack Horner. The show was filmed in Iceland and Mono Lake in California.\n\n\"Alien Planet\" starts out with an interstellar spacecraft named \"Von Braun\", leaving Earth's orbit. Traveling at 20% the speed of light (37,000 miles/s), it reaches Darwin IV in 42 years. Upon reaching orbit, it deploys the \"Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter\", which looks for potential landing sites for the probes. The first probe, \"Balboa,\" explodes along with its lifting body transport during entry, because one of its wings failed to unfold. Two backup probes, \"Leonardo da Vinci\" (nicknamed Leo) and \"Isaac Newton\" (nicknamed Ike), successfully land on the planet, and learn much about its bizarre indigenous lifeforms, including an apparently sapient species.\n\nThe robotic probes sent out to research on Darwin IV are called Horus Probes. Each Horus probe consists of an high, long inflatable, hydrogen-filled balloon, which is covered with solar receptors, a computer 'brain', a 'head' covered with sensors, and several smaller robots that can be sent to places too dangerous for the probes themselves. The probes have a limited degree of artificial intelligence, very similar to the 'processing power' of a 4-year-old. All the real thinking is done by a supercomputer in the orbiting \"Von Braun\". The probes are programmed with different personalities; Ike is more cautious, while Leo is the risk-taker. The two probes are also equipped with a holographic message that will be projected to any sentient life found on Darwin.\n\nAfter the two probes inflate their gas-bags, they encounter a voracious Arrowtongue and watch it pursue a Gyrosprinter. Later that night, the twins find the wreckage of Balboa and are ordered to split up, Ike studying the unique plant life and Leo going after big game. Ike's voyage takes him to one of Darwin IV's pocket forests, where he encounters a flock of Trunk Suckers and their predator, the Daggerwrist. Before his research is finished, a massive hurricane-like storm hits and Ike must take to the sky, launching weather balloons. Leo goes to the mountain ranges and finds a herd of Unths engaged in rutting-like behavior.\n\nAfterward, Leo finds a pair of Bladderhorns engaging in combat. It tries to communicate with one, but a sonic ping interrupts the conversation and scares off the animal, and he is knocked out by a mysterious creature. Ike ventures to the meadows and gullies of Darwin IV, encountering massive Grovebacks and a herd of Littoralopes. Flying above, dangerous predators: the Skewers.\n\nLeo gets destroyed by a mysterious and evasive creature, and Ike, ordered by the \"Von Braun\" to search for Leo's attacker, hopes to find a new sentient species. Ike's route takes him across perilous terrain, and across the Amoebic Sea in its quest for Leo. As it embarks on its journey, one of the Grovebacks seen earlier falls victim to a swarm of Beach Quills. Ike then finds a pack of Prongheads hunting a Gyrosprinter, and crosses the Amoebic Sea (which attempted to attack Ike), encountering a herd of giant Sea Striders.\n\nIke manages to find Leo after a harrowing experience with a Skewer which tries to attack it, but is killed by a spear thrown by the newly discovered floating Eosapien. Shortly afterward, Ike communicates with the Eosapien tribe and discovers that they are truly intelligent. Ike launches a camera disk to record the moment, or perhaps \"to assess the threat\" due to a third Eosapien appearing; however one of the Eosapiens mistakes it as an attack and destroys the camera disk. Before shutting down, the wrecked camera disk records the Eosapien tribe carrying Ike away.\n\nCommentary from notable people discussing the details behind the fictional world of Darwin IV and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, in general, is interspersed throughout the movie.\n\nThe following are the craft and probes that appear in the film:\n\nThe cruise speed of the Von Braun is 20% the speed of light. At this speed, it reaches the planet Darwin IV in 42 years. The \"Von Braun\", named after Wernher von Braun, has two primary propulsion systems: nuclear ion engines for low-speed maneuvers during the first year of spaceflight and an antimatter catalyst to accelerate to 20% the speed of light. Once in orbit it deploys the \"Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter\" and the landing probes. It also has artificial intelligence computers to act as the central command for the mission. During the long cruise to Darwin IV, a metal-composite dust shield protects the spacecraft from interstellar debris. It is jettisoned before \"Von Braun\" brakes in orbit around Darwin IV. Finally, it has a diameter communications dish, deployed in orbit, for information transfer to Earth. It transfers a large amount of information via a laser beam at a frequency of 8 GHz in the X-band.\n\nThe Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter (DRO) was deployed in orbit around Darwin IV from the \"Von Braun\". The spacecraft has a mass of about 5,000 kilograms. Unlike the nuclear-powered \"Von Braun\", the DRO utilizes solar panels, capable of generating several megawatts for power. Its primary purpose was to look for potential landing sites for the Horus probes and to map the entire planet. After deployment, the DRO utilizes its own booster rocket to place it in the proper orbit. The DRO studied the planet for about 1 Darwin IV year (about 1.6 Earth years) to ensure the Horus probes would not land in unacceptable conditions. Instruments carried on the DRO include a synthetic aperture radar, a visible light camera, a near-infrared camera, and a spectrometer. The exact timing of the landings would be determined by computers in the \"Von Braun\" based on data from the DRO.\n\nThe Horus probes are used for the surface operations of the Darwin IV expedition. The \"Von Braun\" carries three probes. Each probe is essentially identical with the exception of their behavior and external color. Each probe is carried to the surface in a lifting body lander. The probes also have the intelligence on par with a 4-year-old child.\n\nProbe Balboa, named after Vasco Núñez de Balboa, was the first probe launched to explore Darwin IV. However, it experienced a malfunction while the two small wings/fins were unfolding. When it entered Darwin IV's atmosphere, non-heat-resistant material that was exposed caught fire, leading to the breakup of the craft. If Probe Balboa's entry into Darwin IV atmosphere is watched carefully, it can be seen that the right wing/fin does not extend and lock into place. Probe Balboa was never given a nickname. It was the shortest lasting probe, since it was never activated. Its color is red.\n\nProbe Leo, named after Leonardo da Vinci, was the second probe to attempt landing on Darwin IV, which was a success. Leo was programmed to take risks and be adventurous, and study animal life. It explored the planet for several days before it went offline due to an Eosapien attack. It came back online momentarily, launching a camera disk, which disturbed the Eosapiens and provoked them to attack a second time. Leo never came back online. Its color is blue.\n\nProbe Ike, named after Isaac Newton, was the third and final probe to land. He was programmed to be more observational and avoid risks. His first objective was the study of plant life; but Ike encountered many more creatures in the process. After Leo went offline, the \"Von Braun\" commanded probe Newton to search for Leo and to take more risks studying animal life. On the way, Ike traveled some distance and discovered several new aliens. Upon arrival at Leo's final transmission site, Ike was almost killed by a Skewer, but was miraculously saved by an Eosapien's spear. It is unknown if this was simply pure luck, or, as a genuine form of extraterrestrial intelligence, if it willingly saved Ike's life. Ike then showed the Eosapien the Earth communication message. Ike was surrounded by Eosapiens and launched its sixth and last camera disk. The Eosapiens thought the camera disk was a threat and attacked it and possibly Ike, thus terminating surface operations of the mission. If an observer looks carefully, they can see that Ike is last seen being carried away by the Eosapien tribe and is presumed to have been destroyed, although his true fate is still debatable. It was the longest-lasting probe on Darwin IV. Its color is yellow.\n\nThe Horus probes (Leo, Ike, and Balboa) carry mini-probes to venture into places too dangerous or too small for the Horus probes. The spiders and disks can be collected and recharged, while the balloons cannot.\n\nCamera disks are small, flying-saucer like disks that can be launched and fly at high speeds. The disks are equipped with two small cameras to record video. The disks were considered as threats by the Eosapiens (Probably because they see them as throwing weapons) and was the main culprit for the probe's destruction. Leo, Ike, and Balboa each have six of them.\n\nIke constantly launched camera disks to study life-forms.\n\nCamera disks 1, 5, and 6 from Ike were destroyed by native life. They were lost to - Daggerwrists (Because it \"wasn't interested in posing\"), Sea Striders (One stepped on the disk by accident), and Eosapiens (They mistook it for a threat for some reason, probably seeing it as throwing a weapon). One of Leo's camera disks was destroyed by an Eosapien (Again, because the disk was mistaken for a threat).\n\nGreen weather balloons are used to help Ike, Leo, and Balboa analyze the current weather conditions. They are built with a sensor that tells the Horus probes what is going on. They also have a small camera. Unlike the camera disks and spider probes, the weather balloons are not retrieved for re-use. It is unknown if any of them got destroyed by some force.\n\nThese robotic spiders are four-legged, and are used to help the Horus probe\n\n\n"}

The brief and mysterious life and death of Erik Johan Stagnelius have given a romantic interest to all that is connected with his name.\n\nStagnelius was born in Gärdslösa, Öland, where his father was a vicar; he was later bishop in Kalmar on the nearby mainland, which probably influenced Stagnelius's spiritual thinking. He came from a large family. Stagnelius showed a natural gift for poetic writing from an early childhood. He took his Bachelor's Degree from Uppsala University in 1814 and got an employment as a clerk in Stockholm. As a person he was said to have been unattractive and unkempt. A woman who knew him, said of his appearance \"where in this shabby person lies the beauty which his poetry expresses?\".\n\nHe was notably gloomy and lived alone for most of his life, although he seemed to flourish during brief visits to his home town. As he first arrived to Stockholm, he strived for success as a poet, but basically this did not come until after his death.\n\nHis first publication was the epic of \"Wladimir den store\" ('Vladimir the Great'; 1817); followed by the romantic poem \"Blenda\". His singular dramas, \"Bacchanterna\" ('The Bacchantes'; 1822), \"Sigurd Ring\", which was posthumous, and \"Martyrerna\" ('The Martyrs'; 1821), are esteemed by many critics to be his most original productions. His mystical lyrics, entitled \"Liljor i Saron\" ('Lilies in Sharon'; 1820), and his sonnets, which are best read in Swedish, may be recommended as among the most delicate products of the Scandinavian mind.\n\nIt is believed that he suffered a chronic physical condition (a side effect of his alleged intense alcohol consumption or possibly Noonan syndrome have been suggested by Swedish researchers) causing him increasing pain, and that he used opium as his main remedy. On the details of his life, little is known. He had only a few friends, and no female companionship. Following his death in Stockholm at the age of 29, no relatives were present at the funeral.\n\nStagnelius has been compared, and not improperly, to Shelley. Several of Stagnelius poems were translated into English by Edmund Gosse (1886). The bulk of his poetry was found in a sack in his shabby apartment after his death. They were almost sent to be burnt, but were instead kept, and several are still appreciated today for their romantic and mystic/spiritual qualities. Perhaps the best known are the poem \"Näcken,\" a romantic verse-based poem about the Nix; \"Till förruttnelsen\" ('For Decay') and \"Resa, Amanda, jag skall\" ('Travel, Amanda, I shall')\n\nHis thinking, which is evident from his later works, is influenced by mystics and romantic philosophers. He was also partly influenced by gnostic beliefs. Not proper, perhaps, in the Christian 19th century Sweden, this possible belief has been thoroughly examined, and is believed to have originated by a reading of the Swedish translation of Ginza Rba, the holy works of the Mandaeism, published as \"Adam's Book\". Other persons whose works he read and were likely influences were Schelling, Jakob Böhme and Plato.\n\n"}

{"id": "1891445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891445", "title": "Quechua people", "text": "Quechua people\n\nQuechua people (, ; ) or Quecha people, may refer to any of the indigenous people of South America who speak the Quechua languages, which originated among the indigenous people of Peru. Although most Quechua speakers are native to the country of origin, there are some significant populations living in Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nThe most common Quechua dialect is Southern Quechua. The Kichwa people of Ecuador speak the Kichwa dialect; in Colombia, the Inga people speak Inga Kichwa.\n\nThe Quechua word for a Quechua speaker is \"runa\" or \"nuna\" (\"person\"); the plural is \"runakuna\" or \"nunakuna\" (\"people\").\n\nSome historical Quechua people are:\n\nThe speakers of Quechua, who total some 4.4 million people in Peru, 1.6 million in Bolivia, 2.2 million in Ecuador (Hornberger and King, 2001), and according to Ethnologue (2006) 8,200 in Chile, 60,000 in Argentina, and a few hundred in Brazil, have an only slight sense of common identity. The various Quechua dialects are in some cases so different that no mutual understanding is possible. Quechua was not only spoken by the Incas, but also by their long-term enemies of the Inca Empire, like the Huanca (Wanka is a Quechua dialect spoken today in the Huancayo area) and the Chanka (the Chanca dialect of Ayacucho) of Peru, and the Kañari (Cañari) in Ecuador. Quechua was spoken by some of these people, for example, the Wanka, before the Incas of Cusco, while other people, especially in Bolivia but also in Ecuador, adopted Quechua only in Inca times or afterward.\n\nQuechua became Peru's second official language in 1969 under the infamous dictatorship of Juan Velasco Alvarado. Recently there have been tendencies toward nation building among Quechua speakers, particularly in Ecuador (Kichwa) but also in Bolivia, where there are only slight linguistic differences from the original Peruvian version. An indication of this effort is the umbrella organization of the Kichwa peoples in Ecuador, ECUARUNARI (\"Ecuador Runakunapak Rikcharimuy\"). Some Christian organizations also refer to a \"Quechua people\", such as the Christian shortwave radio station HCJB, \"The Voice of the Andes\" (\"La Voz de los Andes\"). The term \"Quechua Nation\" occurs in such contexts as the name of the Education Council of the Quechua Nation (\"Consejo Educativo de la Nación Quechua\", CENAQ), which is responsible for Quechua instruction or bilingual intercultural schools in the Quechua-speaking regions of Bolivia. Some Quechua speakers claim that if nation states in Latin America had been built following the European pattern, they should be a single, independent nation.\n\nDespite their ethnic diversity and linguistic distinctions, the various Quechua ethnic groups have numerous cultural characteristics in common. They also share many of these with the Aymara, or other indigenous peoples of the central Andes.\n\nTraditionally, Quechua identity is locally oriented and inseparably linked in each case with the established economic system. It is based on agriculture in the lower altitude regions, and on pastoral farming in the higher regions of the Puna. The typical Andean community extends over several altitude ranges and thus includes the cultivation of a variety of arable crops and/or livestock. The land is usually owned by the local community (\"ayllu\") and is either cultivated jointly or redistributed annually.\n\nBeginning with the colonial era and intensifying after the South American states had gained their independence, large landowners appropriated all or most of the land and forced the native population into bondage (known in Ecuador as \"Huasipungo\", from Kichwa \"wasipunku\", \"front door\"). Harsh conditions of exploitation repeatedly led to revolts by the indigenous farmers, which were forcibly suppressed. The largest of these revolts occurred 1780–1781 under the leadership of José Gabriel Kunturkanki.\n\nSome indigenous farmers re-occupied their ancestors' lands and expelled the landlords during the takeover of governments by infamous dictatorships in the middle of the 20th century, such as in 1952 in Bolivia (Víctor Paz Estenssoro) and 1968 in Peru (Juan Velasco Alvarado). The agrarian reforms included the illegal expropriation of large landowners. In Bolivia there was a redistribution of the land to the indigenous population as their private property. This disrupted traditional Quechua and Aymara culture based on communal ownership, but \"ayllus\" have been retained up to the present time in remote regions, such as in the Peruvian Quechua community of Q'ero.\n\nThe struggle for land rights continues up to the present time to be a political focal point of everyday Quechua life. The Kichwa ethnic groups of Ecuador which are part of the ECUARUNARI association were recently able to regain communal land titles or the return of estates—in some cases through militant activity. Especially the case of the community of Sarayaku has become well known among the Kichwa of the lowlands, who after years of struggle were able to successfully resist expropriation and exploitation of the rain forest for petroleum recovery.\n\nA distinction is made between two primary types of joint work. In the case of \"mink'a\", people work together for projects of common interest (such as the construction of communal facilities). \"Ayni\" is, in contrast, reciprocal assistance, whereby members of an \"ayllu\" help a family to accomplish a large private project, for example house construction, and in turn can expect to be similarly helped later with a project of their own.\n\nIn almost all Quechua ethnic groups, many traditional handicrafts are an important aspect of material culture. This includes a tradition of weaving handed down from Inca times or earlier, using cotton, wool (from llamas, alpacas, guanacos, vicunas) and a multitude of natural dyes, and incorporating numerous woven patterns (\"pallay\"). Houses are usually constructed using air-dried clay bricks (\"tika\", or in Spanish \"adobe\"), or branches and clay mortar (“wattle and daub”), with the roofs being covered with straw, reeds, or puna grass (\"ichu\").\n\nThe disintegration of the traditional economy, for example, regionally through mining activities and accompanying proletarian social structures, has usually led to a loss of both ethnic identity and the Quechua language. This is also a result of steady migration to large cities (especially to Lima), which has resulted in acculturation by Hispanic society there.\n\nQuechua peoples cultivate and eat a variety of foods. They domesticated potatoes and cultivate thousands of potato varieties, which are used for food and medicine. Climate change is threatening their potato and other traditional crops but they are undertaking conservation and adaptation efforts. Quinoa is another staple crop grown by Quechua peoples.\n\n\"Ch’arki\" (the origin of the English word \"jerky\") is a Quechua dried (and sometimes salted) meat. It was traditionally made from llama meat that was sun- and freeze-dried in the Andean sun and cold nights, but is now also often made from horse and beef, with variation among countries.\n\n\"Pachamanca\", a Quechua word for a pit cooking technique used in Peru, includes several types of meat such as chicken, beef, pork, lamb, and/or mutton; tubers such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, yucca, \"uqa\"/\"ok’a\" (\"oca\" in Spanish), and mashwa; other vegetables such as maize/corn and fava beans; seasonings; and sometimes cheese in a small pot and/or tamales.\n\nGuinea pigs are also sometimes raised for meat. Other foods and crops include the meat of Llamas and Alpacas as well as beans, barley, hot peppers, coriander, and peanuts.\n\nUp to the present time Quechuas continue to be victims of political conflicts and ethnic persecution. In the Peruvian civil war of the 1980s between the government and \"Sendero Luminoso\" about three-quarters of the estimated 70,000 death toll were Quechuas, whereas the war parties were without exception whites and \"mestizos\" (people with mixed descent from both natives and Spaniards).\n\nThe forced sterilization policy under Alberto Fujimori affected almost exclusively Quechua and Aymara women, a total exceeding 200,000. The Bolivian film director Jorge Sanjines dealt with the issue of forced sterilization in 1969 in his Quechua-language feature film \"Yawar Mallku\".\n\nPerceived ethnic discrimination continues to play a role at the parliamentary level. When the newly elected Peruvian members of parliament Hilaria Supa Huamán and María Sumire swore their oath of office in Quechua—for the first time in the history of Peru in an indigenous language—the Peruvian parliamentary president Martha Hildebrandt and the parliamentary officer Carlos Torres Caro refused their acceptance.\n\nPractically all Quechuas in the Andes have been nominally Roman Catholic since colonial times. Nevertheless, traditional religious forms persist in many regions, blended with Christian elements - a fully integrated Syncretism. Quechua ethnic groups also share traditional religions with other Andean peoples, particularly belief in Mother Earth (\"Pachamama\"), who grants fertility and to whom burnt offerings and libations are regularly made. Also important are the mountain spirits (\"apu\") as well as lesser local deities (\"wak'a\"), who are still venerated especially in southern Peru.\n\nThe Quechuas came to terms with their repeated historical experience of tragedy in the form of various myths. These include the figure of \"Nak'aq\" or \"Pishtaco\" (\"butcher\"), the white murderer who sucks out the fat from the bodies of the indigenous peoples he kills, and a song about a bloody river. In their myth of \"Wiraquchapampa\", the Q'ero people describe the victory of the \"Apus\" over the Spaniards. Of the myths still alive today, the \"Inkarrí\" myth common in southern Peru is especially interesting; it forms a cultural element linking the Quechua groups throughout the region from Ayacucho to Cusco. Some Quechua people consider classic products of the region - such as the Corn beer Chicha, Coca leaves and local potatoes as having a religious significance, but this belief is not uniform across communities.\n\nQuinine, which is found naturally in bark of cinchona tree, is known to be used by Quechuas people for malaria-like symptoms.\n\nWhen chewed, coca acts as a mild stimulant and suppresses hunger, thirst, pain, and fatigue; it is also used to alleviate altitude sickness. Coca leaves are chewed during work in the fields as well as during breaks in construction projects in Quechua provinces. Coca leaves are the raw material from which cocaine, one of Peru's most historically important exports, is chemically extracted.\n\nMany indigenous women wear the colorful traditional attire, complete with bowler style hat. The hat has been worn by Quechua and Aymara women since the 1920s, when it was brought to the country by British railway workers. They are still commonly worn today.\n\nThe traditional dress worn by Quechua women today is a mixture of styles from Pre-Spanish days and Spanish Colonial peasant dress. Younger Quechua men generally wear Western-style clothing, the most popular being synthetic football shirts and tracksuit pants. In certain regions, women also generally wear Western-style clothing. Older men still wear dark wool knee-length handwoven bayeta pants. A woven belt called a \"chumpi\" is also worn which provides protection to the lower back when working in the fields. Men's fine dress includes a woollen waistcoat, similar to a sleeveless juyuna as worn by the women but referred to as a \"chaleco\". \"Chalecos\" can be richly decorated.\n\nThe most distinctive part of men's clothing is the handwoven poncho. Nearly every Quechua man and boy has a poncho, generally red in colour decorated with intricate designs. Each district has a distinctive pattern. In some communities such as Huilloc, Patacancha, and many villages in the Lares Valley ponchos are worn as daily attire. However most men use their ponchos on special occasions such as festivals, village meetings, weddings etc.\n\nAs with the women, ajotas, sandals made from recycled tyres, are the standard footwear. They are cheap and durable.\n\nA \"ch'ullu\" is frequently worn. This is a knitted hat with earflaps. The first ch'ullu that a child receives is traditionally knitted by his father. In the Ausangate region chullos are often ornately adorned with white beads and large tassels called t'ikas. Men sometimes wear a felt hat called a sombrero over the top of the ch'ullu decorated with \"centillo\", finely decorated hat bands.\nSince ancient times men have worn small woven pouches called \"ch'uspa\" used to carry their coca leaves.\n\nThe following list of Quechua ethnic groups is only a selection and delimitations vary. In some cases these are village communities of just a few hundred people, in other cases ethnic groups of over a million.\n\n\nLowlands\nHighlands\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a part of the FC Barcelona multi sports club, and was founded on 29 November 1942. The club competes domestically in the Liga ASOBAL and in the European Champions League. It is the most successful handball club in Spain and Europe with a record number of domestic and international titles.\n\nThe handball section of Futbol Club Barcelona was founded on 29 November 1942 during the presidency of Enrique Piñeyro. In the beginning handball was played with eleven players per team and did not have a specialized field to play. They used football fields until the late 1950s, when they started to play, as in actual games, with seven players and a covered field.\n\nIn the early stages, competitions were dominated by other teams like Atlético de Madrid and Granollers, breaking their domination few times. Things changed radically with the arrival of one of the best coaches in handball history, Valero Rivera. With him, the team became virtually unbeatable in Spain and in Europe, winning a record of 62 trophies under his rule, including 5 consecutive European Cups.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, the Barça handball team, conducted by the head coach Xavi Pascual, won the Super Globe trophy, the only trophy that was still missing from the club's trophy cabinet.\n\nFC Barcelona’s handball team closed out the 2013/14 Liga Asobal with a record-breaking winning run.

Along the way they meet up with another progressive punk band, Minor Threat, whom they hang out with at the Dischord house for about a week near the end of their ill-fated tour.\n\nThe bands head north up through San Francisco, Oregon, and Seattle. The film documents Social Distortion and Youth Brigade live shows; it also features Minor Threat at band practice. At one point in the movie, Social Distortion's Mike Ness sits on a porch and writes future underground hit Another State of Mind. The film documents not only the complex and challenging social dynamics of the punk scene, the touring bands and their crew, but also documents the DIY punk touring circuit in its infancy. \n\nA final bus break-down in D.C. causes Social Distortion to split up. Liles and Danell abandon the group to stay with friends of Brinson's, where they voice their exhaustion with the tour and the rest of the group. Out of desperation, the others go to the local Kmart to shop for tarps with the members of Minor Threat. \n\nMike Ness ends up being stranded when the rest of Social Distortion heads back to OC where they feel they have a better chance of making money rather than staying on the difficult tour. Ness has really no choice but to grab a flight back to LA himself and try to regroup. Youth Brigade rents a truck and drives back to Los Angeles.\n\nFour cast members have died since the making of this film; Dennis Danell (brain aneurysm in 2000) and Brent Liles (traffic accident in 2007) of Social Distortion, and road crew members Louis Dufau (drug overdose in 1988) and Dominic Mastergeorge (died in Middletown, Connecticut in 1995). Additionally, Marcel, a wheelchair-using punk who is shown in the Montreal scene died in 1984. Manon Brière, another young Montreal punk, is still around and she fronted bands Generatorz and Maninc Manon and the Guest List.\nIn the mid 1980s Mike Brinson went to nuclear engineering school in the Navy. He currently resides in Indiana where he has 2 sons and works in the aerospace industry.\n\nStrangely, in the beginning of the documentary, Dennis Danell jokingly says that he's 38 and old. On February 29, 2000, Danell died at the age of 38.\n\n\nFilmmakers Peter Stuart and Adam Small came upon a large-scale project which immediately captured their imagination: the Better Youth Organization of Los Angeles was planning a North American tour. Eleven assorted punks would be traveling across the country in a broken down school bus. It was a chance to explore and document the punk community more extensively than ever before.\n\nOn August 17, 1982, armed with one production assistant, Stuart and Small set off in their rental truck on this journey through the underground. For six weeks and ten thousand miles, they recorded the adventures of the two touring bands – Youth Brigade and Social Distortion. More than just concert footage, this film documents the rich collection of characters in and around the tour, and the hardships and dangers of life on the road. The film was made on the cheap side and the scenes that feature instructions for slam dancing were filmed as filler so that the film would be at a viable length for release and distribution.\n\nThe poster was designed by Josh Freeman, now president and creative director of FreeAssociates, the design/advertising agency in Los Angeles.\n\nCommentaries by Mike Ness, the directors and Youth Brigade.\n\n"}
{"id": "1891478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891478", "title": "Honey Ryder", "text": "Honey Ryder\n\nHoneychile Rider is a fictional character in Ian Fleming's James Bond novel \"Dr. No\". In the 1962 Bond film of the same name, her name was shortened and changed to Honey Ryder. In the film, she is played by Swiss actress Ursula Andress and due to her heavy accent was dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl.\n\nIn the film series, Ryder is widely regarded as the first Bond girl, although she is not the first woman in the film to be with Bond (that distinction belongs to Sylvia Trench, while Miss Taro was Bond's first mission-related \"conquest\"). Her entrance in the film, emerging from the ocean in a white bikini, holding two large seashells, while the sun shines on her wet blonde hair, is considered a classic James Bond moment. The bikini is a movie invention - in the corresponding scene of the original novel, the character Honeychile Rider emerges wearing her belt only.\n\nAndress referred to the \"Dr. No\" bikini as the \"secret of her success\". As an homage, Halle Berry performed a similar scene in an orange bikini in the 20th James Bond film, \"Die Another Day\".\n\nUrsula Andress was later mentioned by name in the novel \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", and described as a \"beautiful movie star\". As such, Andress is the first of only two entertainers that have actually starred in a Bond film to be mentioned by Fleming in his James Bond novels. The other is David Niven who co-starred as James Bond in the 1967 film adaptation of \"Casino Royale\" which also starred Andress.\n\nHoneychile Rider is a Jamaican shell diver, descended from an old-established colonial family. She was orphaned at the age of five when her parents' house was burned down. She then lived with her black nanny in a cellar until she was 15, when her nanny died. Rider reveals that she was also raped as a young girl by the overseer of the property on which she lives. She later avenged her rape by killing the man with a poisonous spider.\n\nRider is an independent and very beautiful woman, with the minor imperfection of a broken nose, a lasting memory of the time the overseer punched her in the face to subdue her before sexually assaulting her. She became a shell diver near Crab Key in order to make enough money by selling the shells to American collectors, so that she can then have plastic surgery performed on her nose. While on Crab Key, she meets James Bond and confides in him she dreams of becoming a call girl in New York City order to live a good lifestyle. Bond gently dissuades her, citing how sordid prostitution is. Rider and Bond are later captured by Dr. Julius No, who attempts to kill Rider by tying her to some rocks and allowing crabs to eat her alive. However, she is aware that the crabs do not like human flesh and they won't attack her. She escapes, meets up with a badly injured Bond and, after Bond kills Dr. No's three hired assassins, they steal his armored dune buggy and escape to Bond's hidden canoe. Rider then single-handedly sails them back to Jamaica while Bond lies unconscious in the bottom of the canoe. She then tends his wounds until he can get to a hospital the next day. It is implied in the book that she and Bond will later travel to New York City where Rider will get her nose fixed; and that on her return, she will work at the Jamaican natural history museum. Before they part, Bond and Rider have dinner at her home, and the couple share a romantic night together before Bond leaves Jamaica.\n\nIn later novels, Bond divulges that Honeychile Rider moved to Philadelphia, where she married a doctor by the name of Wilder and had two children with him.\n\nHoney Ryder is a beachcomber making a living selling seashells in Miami. As in the novel, she is a very independent woman claiming to not need help from anyone. Resourceful and courageous, Ryder states that she can defend herself against any hostile when she first meets Bond. Although she is at first wary of Bond, he is allowed to get closer when he comments that his intentions are honourable.\n\nLike Pussy Galore in \"Goldfinger\", Ryder does not appear until halfway through the film. She comes out of the ocean singing \"Under the Mango Tree\", Bond startles her when he joins in singing. She pulls her dagger out, wary of Bond's position but grows to trust him. Ryder shows Quarrel and Bond a secret way to escape No's men, while being chased. After they evade No's men, she tells Bond how her father died when on Crab Key, and that she was raped by a local landlord. Ryder relates how she got her revenge by putting a black widow spider in his mosquito net and causing his lingering death. When in a marshy region of the island, Quarrel, Bond and Ryder have a close encounter with No's \"dragon\". Quarrel dies and the remaining two get captured. No's men wash away radiation that Honey and Bond got on their clothes and they get rooms of luxury. The next day, they meet Doctor No. When in conversation, No has Ryder taken away. After Bond kills No, he saves her from the island and they make love in a towed boat.\n\nIn a UK survey conducted in 2003 by Channel 4, the character's entrance in \"Dr. No\" was voted number one in \"the 100 Greatest Sexy Moments\" (BBC 2003). Honey Ryder was voted the best Bond Girl by \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\nAuthor Anthony Horowitz named his James Bond tribute character Alex Rider after Honeychile Rider.\n\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"| On-screen appearances\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"| Status\n"}

It is located at Prinzregentenstraße 1 at the southern edge of the Englischer Garten, Munich's largest park.\n\nThe building was constructed from 1933 to 1937 following plans of architect Paul Ludwig Troost as Nazi Germany's first monumental structure of Nazi architecture and as Nazi propaganda. The museum, then called \"Haus der Deutschen Kunst\" (\"House of German Art\"), was opened on 18 July 1937 as a showcase for what the Nazi Party regarded as Germany's finest art, with celebrations including a historical pageant and a military parade. The inaugural exhibition was the \"Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung\" (\"Great German Art Exhibition\"), which was intended as an edifying contrast to the condemned modern art on display in the concurrent Degenerate Art Exhibition.\n\nOn 15 and 16 July 1939, the \"Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung\" inside the \"Haus der Deutschen Kunst\" was complemented by the monumental \"Tag der Deutschen Kunst\" celebration of \"2,000 years of Germanic culture\" where luxuriously draped floats (one of them carrying a 5 meter tall golden Nazi \"Reichsadler\") and thousands of actors in historical costumes paraded down Prinzregentenstraße for hours in the presence of Adolf Hitler, Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, Albert Speer, Robert Ley, Reinhard Heydrich, and many other high-ranking Nazis, with minor events taking place in the \"Englischer Garten\" nearby. \n\nThe 1939 \"Tag der Deutschen Kunst\" was documented by a group of hobby cinematographers on 16 mm Kodachrome color movie. The resulting 30-minute film is still pristine today due to Kodachrome's unusual archival properties, and is available in a variety of editions on VHS and DVD, such as \"Farben 1939 - Tag der Deutschen Kunst in München\".\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the museum building was first used by the American occupation forces as an officers' mess; in that time, the building came to be known as the \"P1\", a shortening of its street address. The building's original purpose can still be seen in such guises as the swastika-motif mosaics in the ceiling panels of its front portico.\n\nBeginning in 1946, the museum rooms, now partitioned into several smaller exhibition areas, started to be used as temporary exhibition space for trade shows and visiting art exhibitions. Some parts of the museum were also used to showcase works from those of Munich's art galleries that had been destroyed during the war. The original steps at the building's entrance were removed to make way for a road tunnel, which opened in 1972. \n\nIn 2002, the National Collection of Modern and Contemporary Arts moved into the Pinakothek der Moderne. Today, while housing no permanent art exhibition of its own, the museum is still used as a showcase venue for temporary exhibitions and traveling exhibitions, including on Tutankhamun, \"Zeit der Staufer\", Gilbert and George (2007), Andreas Gursky (2007), Anish Kapoor (2007), Ai Weiwei (2009), Ellsworth Kelly (2011), Georg Baselitz (2014), Louise Bourgeois (2015), and Frank Bowling (2017). A 2012 joint venture with the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, \"Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974\" was the first major museum survey of land art worldwide. The museum also drew acclaim for \"Postwar: Art Between the Pacific and the Atlantic, 1945-1965\" in 2016, an effort to tell a global narrative of art in the two decades after World War II. A 2019 retrospective of the Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui became the museum’s best-attended show in 10 years. \n\nIn 2013, London-based architect David Chipperfield was commissioned to submit plans for refurbishing Haus der Kunst; the plans were eventually presented to the public in 2016. For approximately 60 million euros, the planned renovation aims to create space for cinema, performance and musical events. Chipperfield also proposed to open up blocked skylights to allow daylight into the building.\n\nAfter artistic director Okwui Enwezor’s departure for health reasons in 2018, Haus der Kunst appointed an expert commission to oversee programming and strategy between 2019 and 2020. The commission was led by Bice Curiger and also included Achim Hochdörfer of the Museum Brandhorst and the collector Ingvild Goetz. In 2019, a selection committee selected Andrea Lissoni as new artistic director; the committee was chaired by Nina Zimmer and included Daniel Birnbaum, Doryun Chong, Susanne Gaensheimer, and Nicholas Serota. \n\nDespite being a non-collecting institution, Haus der Kunst has over the years received numerous works of art. \n\nIn 2011, Haus der Kunst forged a partnership with the private Goetz Collection to co-curate exhibits of video art. By 2013, it was one of the beneficiaries – along with the Bavarian State Museums and the Neues Museum in Nuremberg – when Ingvild Goetz donated her collection of video art to the state of Bavaria and made the collection as a whole, which includes almost 5,000 works, available on permanent loan.\n\nIn 2017, Jewish artist Mel Bochner donated his piece \"Joys of Yiddish\" (2012-15) to Haus der Kunst. Comprising a list of Yiddish words in yellow on black, it traverses the museum's façade as a reminder of the tragic disappearance of the language from German culture.\n\n\nThe State of Bavaria is the biggest shareholder of Haus der Kunst, and provides the museum with millions of euros every year. Since 1983, the museum building also houses the nightclub P1, Munich's famous high-society destination; the rent is one of the museum's revenue streams.\n\nIn 2011, Dercon left Haus der Kunst with capital of €1.5 million. During his time in office, Enwezor oversaw the initial fundraising for the planned €150 million renovation of Haus der Kunst. In 2018, however, Haus der Kunst cancelled an exhibition of video and performance artist Joan Jonas, citing “a difficult financial situation stemming from management errors of the past.” It also had to postpone a Theaster Gates show until 2019.\n\nIn March 2017, a scandal received international media attention when the director of the Haus der Kunst, Okwui Enwezor, fired a member of the Church of Scientology based on the man's religious affiliation. In Bavaria, employees are required to sign that they are not Scientologists in order to obtain employment if the institution receives financial support from the Bavarian government.\n\n"}

His family was poor, and when he was 10, his father fell sick and Robertino helped the family by delivering bakery products to restaurants. He enjoyed singing folk songs on his way and was noticed by people for his singing voice. After a request to perform at a wedding in a restaurant, Robertino was sought after by other restaurants who competed for his service.\n\nRobertino was singing at Cafe Grand Italia where Neapolitan actor Totò and Danish TV producer Volmer Sørensen noticed him. Sørensen was vacationing in Rome with his wife, singer Grethe Sønck, who noticed the boy. Sørensen persuaded his father to sign a contract, which stated that the boy would sing till age 17, and became his producer. That led to performances on Danish TV shows, tours of Scandinavia and Europe. Robertino would spend months on tour, singing up to three concerts a day, until his voice started to change. He recorded an album while in Copenhagen, and later published several albums and appeared in movies.\n\nHis voice eventually changed and became a baritenor. Loreti still travels through Europe, the US and Russia performing in concerts. In post-Soviet countries, he became friends with singers Muslim Magomayev (died in 2008), Tamara Sinyavskaya and Joseph Kobzon. Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova requested his records played while she was in space. Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko wrote a poem titled \"Robertino Loreti\".\n\nPietro Castelluzzo, 58, was arrested Thursday, February 25, 2010, by members of the Organized Crime Enforcement unit of the Toronto Police Service, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and charged with four counts of counselling to commit three murders, the target of one of which was Roberto Loreti. The suspect had known the singer for decades, and Loreti had stayed at Castelluzo family home in Toronto in the 1980s. It was at that time that Castelluzzo believed Loreti had slept with his wife. The murder was to take place while Loreti had an engagement at the Fallsview Casino, Niagara Falls, Ontario, the following weekend. \n\n"}

He was the second son of Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. Educated at Eton and Oxford, he was rector of Hatfield for 28 years before being appointed bishop. Married in 1887, he had three daughters and four sons, three of whom were killed in the First World War. As bishop he was generally liked, but had a reputation for eccentricity.\n\nWilliam Cecil (as he was generally known) was born at Hatfield House, the second son of Prime Minister Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. He was educated at Eton, where he was bullied and nicknamed \"Fish\", a name that stuck with him among family and friends throughout his life. Following Eton he was educated at University College, Oxford where he gained a third in law. After leaving university, Cecil worked for a few months in London's East End slums.\n\nHe was ordained in 1887, and married Lady Florence (\"Fluffy\") Mary Bootle-Wilbraham, daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom on 16 August of the same year. They had four sons and three daughters. Their eldest son Randle William was born 28 November 1889 and was killed in action during the First World War on 1 December 1917. Their third and fourth sons were also killed in that war: John Arthur (28 March 1893 – 27 August 1918) and Rupert Edward (20 January 1895 – 11 July 1915). Their second son Victor Alexander (21 May 1891 – 17 January 1977) was wounded twice in the war, but survived. Their three daughters were Eve Alice (13 January 1900 – 1994) who married Vice-Admiral Richard Shelley, her twin sister Mary Edith (13 January 1900 – 1994), and Anne (8 October 1906 – 23 October 1924).\n\nCecil's first curacy was in Great Yarmouth, but this lasted for less than a year, because in 1888 his father had him appointed as Rector of Hatfield, which came with a fine rectory some distance from the town. However he persuaded his father to build him a smaller house nearer to the town so he could be closer to his parishioners. He remained in that post for the next 28 years, also becoming Rural Dean of Hertford from 1904; a chaplain to King Edward VII from 1909; and an honorary canon of St Alban's Cathedral from 1910. In 1908 he attended the fifth Lambeth Conference which led him to an interest in China, which country he later visited several times. He tried unsuccessfully to establish a Christian university there and in 1910, with his wife, he wrote a book: \"Changing China\".\n\nIn 1916 the then Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith offered him the post of Bishop of Exeter, and although initially unwilling to move, he finally accepted. Trevor Beeson, in his book \"The Bishops\" (2002), expresses surprise at the appointment, stating that it was \"easily the most extraordinary episcopal appointment of the twentieth century\" because of his total unsuitability \"by aptitude and experience for a bishopric\". Beeson went on to surmise that only a person with a large personal income such as Cecil could have been appointed to the see at the time because one third of its annual income was being paid as a pension to his predecessor, Archibald Robertson who had resigned aged 63 and lived until 1931.\n\nCecil's episcopate was notable for its tolerance. He took the view that the principles of the Church were broad enough to allow wide latitude in the permissible forms of religious service, so he did not try to enforce any particular theological school of thought, and maintained a friendly relationship with the leaders of Nonconformist groups. He did, however, quarrel with his cathedral when he suggested the abolition of the office of the Dean, with the money that would be saved being used to pay for a suffragan bishop to increase pastoral care in the diocese. His proposal did not come to fruition and was put down as one of \"Love in a Mist's\" madcap ideas.\n\nAs bishop, Cecil gained a reputation for eccentricity and the nickname of \"Love in a Mist\" was given to him, according to Beeson, on account of his \"administrative ineptitude and autocratic unwillingness to take advice\", ameliorated by a most loving personality.\n\nBeeson relates several instances of Cecil's eccentric behaviour. On one occasion a guest having tea with him at his home was surprised when he fed pieces of crumpets to two rats that came out of holes in the floor, and threw powdered copper sulphate on the fire to turn the flames green, remarking that he liked the colour. Once, goes another story, while robing in the vestry before a service, he held a handkerchief between his teeth, but forgot to return it to his pocket and proceeded to the altar with it still hanging from his mouth. He had been heard to complain that the Bible was \"an awkward book\", and while travelling around his diocese he would often ring up his wife to ask where he was.\n\nShortly after his death in 1936, he was commemorated in the cathedral by two sculptures, both bearded: one is on the screen of the Speke chapel in which he is depicted as St Martin giving his cloak to a beggar; the other, as St Peter, is high up on the bishop's throne and was created in 1938 by the Exeter woodcarver, Herbert Read. A tablet in the floor by the throne expresses the wish that the statue will \"keep for ever alive the memory\" of Lord William Cecil.\n\n\nBishop Cecil married on 16 August 1887, Lady Florence Mary Bootle Wilbraham, daughter of 1st Earl of Lathom. They had issue:\n\n"}

Spectrum is manned by agents recruited from various military services, who are each assigned colour codenames to hide their true identities. Under the command of Colonel White, Spectrum has become the supreme peacekeeping force, maintaining a fleet of sophisticated vehicles for use by Spectrum field agents.\n\nA mission to locate the source of mysterious signals originating from Mars unleashed the power of the Mysterons, a ruthless alien consciousness. When Spectrum Captains Scarlet and Black discovered the Mysteron city on Mars, Black mistook the intentions of a probe for a hostile offensive and opened fire, completely destroying the city. Using their power of retrometabolism (the ability to recreate matter), the Mysterons rebuilt their city, killed Black, and promised to crush Earth and its destructive people. This has taken the form of a war of nerves, with the Mysterons using their powers to influence people, vehicles and inanimate objects to fall under their control.\n\nThe Mysterons' primary Earth agent is Captain Black, recreated from the body of the original Spectrum agent. Captain Scarlet was also engineered to become an agent of destruction, but the Mysterons' hold over him was broken after he fell through a power conduit in the Skybase engineering section. Retaining the original man's memories, personality and loyalties, the new Captain Scarlet also retains the Mysteron ability to survive injuries that would prove fatal to any other person. Spectrum's personnel and facilities are now mainly mobilised to combat the threat of the Mysterons, with Captain Scarlet as their greatest weapon.\n\nSkybase is a 330 metre long command ship and the operational headquarters of Spectrum. It is permanently stationed above the clouds at 18,288 m. There are six main engines to keep the base positioned in the sky and a further ten engines designed to keep Skybase balanced. Skybase is home to the fleet of high-tech Spectrum vehicles, including the squadron of Falcon aircraft.\n\nThe Falcons are handled on Skybase using a unique magnetic control system. After landing on the magna-strip runway, a circular lift lowers the plane into the hangar. Robotic arms automatically re-fuel, and re-arm guns and missiles. Using this system means that the Falcons are always action ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese craft are either Spectrum vehicles (used off-Earth), or vehicles not associated with Spectrum but used multiple times during the series:\n\n\n\nITV chose to air the series on the Saturday Morning entertainment show \"Ministry of Mayhem\", which disappointed Gerry Anderson. \"They took my half-hour show, cut the titles off and cut it in half. It wasn't even listed so people who watched \"Ministry of Mayhem\" had to wait and watch all the nonsense going on before the first half. When it finished they didn't say there was a second half or when it was going to start. After they had shown all the episodes, legally it had to be cited as a repeat so it never had a premiere. It just broke my heart.\" Episodes were aired in the order they were completed in, meaning that the series finale aired as the penultimate instalment. This is because an alternative episode had to be made after one was abandoned because Gerry Anderson thought it was too scary for younger children. On 29 September 2017 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the original \"Captain Scarlet\" series, \"New Captain Scarlet\" was brought to North America via Amazon Video.\n\nBoth Series 1 and 2 are available on DVD in the UK, the latter being produced under the ITV DVD banner. Individual volumes are available with three or four episodes on each disk and box sets of all volumes from both series are available separately. The DVD case for Series 2 gives a completely inaccurate description of the episode \"Grey Skulls\". The description mentions Scarlet taking a camping holiday with his sister and her son when they are attacked by the Mysterons. They then seek shelter in a house owned by an old toymaker and collector (plans were for him to resemble Gerry Anderson) but the Mysterons then bring to life all the toys in the house with murderous intentions. This episode (called \"House of Dolls\") was originally planned and scripted but eventually scrapped, as it was considered too scary for small children, and may not have been shown by broadcasters, so it was replaced by \"Grey Skulls\". However, the script was given a live performance by the cast at the 2006 Fanderson convention Sector 25 (with a guest appearance by Shane Rimmer as the toymaker). Series 2 is rated 12, due to some rather blunt violence that was not shown in the CITV version. It is also worth noting that the episode in Series 2 known as \"Duel\" has the wrong name on the box for the holiday resort. It is called Serendipity on the episode summaries, but was called Tranquility in the episode itself. Furthermore, the episode order for the last disc of the season 2 DVD is incorrect. The final episode of the series \"Dominion\" and the aforementioned \"Grey Skulls\", which was the penultimate episode, should be watched in reverse order.

The term sometimes also refers, by extension, to the company that operates the store. The store may sell general dry goods, in which case it is a general merchandise retailer (however traditional department stores, as the predecessor format, are generally not classified as \"big box\"), or may be limited to a particular specialty (such establishments are often called \"category killers\") or may also sell groceries, in which case some countries (mostly in Europe) use the term hypermarket, whereas in the U.S. there is no specific term for the format, which both Target and Walmart offer in most branches.\n\nTypical architectural characteristics include the following:\n\nBig box stores are often clustered in shopping centers known as retail parks in the U.K. and, in the United States, when they range in size from to , they are referred to as power centers.\n\nCommercially, big-box stores can be broken down into two categories: general merchandise (examples include Walmart, Kmart and Target), and specialty stores (such as Home Depot, Barnes & Noble, or Best Buy) which specialize in goods within a specific range, such as hardware, books, or consumer electronics respectively. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, many traditional retailers—such as Tesco and Praktiker opened stores in the big-box-store format in an effort to compete with big-box chains, which are expanding internationally as their home markets reach maturity.\n\nBig-box development has at times been opposed by labor unions because the employees of such stores are usually not unionized. Unions such as the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770 and the Joint Labor Management Committee of the Retail Food Industry have expressed concern about the grocery market because stores such as Kmart, Target, and Walmart now sell groceries. Unions and cities are attempting to use land-use ordinances to restrict these businesses.\n\nBecause it is generally inaccessible to pedestrians and often can only be reached by motor vehicles, the big-box store has been criticized as unsustainable and a failure of urban planning.\n\nThe first company in Australia to use the big-box model was IKEA beginning operation in Australia in 1975. Bunnings Warehouse followed in 1995 and Mitre 10 Australia adopted the model with the \"Mitre 10 Mega\" stores first opening at Beenleigh, Queensland in 2004. Costco has since expanded across Australia since opening its first store in 2009.\n\nApart from major American big-box stores such as Walmart Canada and briefly now-defunct Target Canada, there are many retail chains operating exclusively in Canada. These include stores such as (followed after each slash by the owner) Hudson's Bay/Home Outfitters, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, Rona, Winners/HomeSense, Canadian Tire/Mark's/Sport Chek, Shoppers Drug Mart, Chapters/Indigo Books and Music, Sobeys, and many others. The indigenous Loblaw Companies Limited has expanded and multiplied its Real Canadian Superstore (and Maxi & Cie in Quebec) branded outlets to try to fill any genuine big-box market and fend off the damaging competition that a large Walmart penetration would inflict on Canadian-based retailers.\n\nIn the early 21st century, commercial developers in Canada such as RioCan chose to build big-box stores (often grouped together in so-called \"power centres\") in lieu of traditional shopping malls. Examples include Deerfoot Meadows (Calgary), Stonegate Shopping Centre and Preston Crossing (Saskatoon), South Edmonton Common (Edmonton), and Heartland Town Centre (Mississauga).\n\nThere are currently more than 300 power centers, which usually contain multiple big-box stores, located throughout Canada.\n\nMost large grocery stores in China are of the big box variety, selling big screen TVs, computers, mobile phones, bicycles, and clothing. Many foreign names appear, such as Carrefour, Auchan, Tesco, Lotte Mart, and Walmart, as well as dozens of Chinese chains. Most stores are three stories with moving sidewalk-style escalators. Some stores are so large as to have 60 checkout terminals and their own fleet of buses to bring customers to the store at no charge.\n\nTo contend against Carrefour, PARKnSHOP opened the first superstore in 1996 based on the concept of a wet market. Most superstores in Hong Kong emphasizes one-stop shopping, such as providing car park services. Today, PARKnSHOP has more than 50 superstores and megastores, making it the largest superstore network in Hong Kong. The first Wellcome superstore opened in 2000 and it has only 17 superstores. In addition, CRC has four superstores in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, because Hong Kong is a very densely populated city, the sizes of superstores are considerably smaller than those in other countries. Some superstores are running at deficit, such as Chelsea Heights which therefore has stopped selling fresh fish. Furthermore, some PARKnSHOP superstores and megastores, such as Fortress World, belong to the same corporation, Hutchison Whampoa.\n\nMany configurations exist: the hypermarket that sells many kinds of goods under one roof (like French chains Carrefour, Auchan, and E.Leclerc), most of which are integrated within a shopping mall; the supermarket that is a smaller version of a hypermarket; the market located in city centres; the department store, which first appeared in Paris, then opened in other parts of the world; the \"category killer\" superstore that mainly sells goods in a particular domain (automotive, electronics, home furniture, etc.); and the warehouse store.\n\nIndia is going through a retail revolution since the late 1990s, following the introduction of Big Bazaar in 2001.\n\nHowever, even before that, large retail stores were not uncommon in India. Spencer's, a popular hypermart, traces its history as far back as 1863. Likewise Saravana Stores operating as a large independent showroom format since 1969, continue to grow in a mammoth manner. Saravana Stores operating format is said to be the inspiration for Big Bazaar's Kishore Biyani.\n\nSimilarly, conglomerates, such as Raheja's, Future Group, Bharti, Godrej, Reliance, and TATA, have over the last decade ventured into large-format retail chains. However, most of the stores opened in large malls and not as independent big box format stores, even though small and medium enterprises (SMEs) still account for the majority of the daily consumer transaction needs. However, the most successful consumer retail chain that took the market and penetrated also to tier 2 and tier 3 cities was D Mart, owned by Avenue Supermarkets Limited.\n\nAn attempt was made to allow international large format retailers such as Walmart into the country. However, it was successfully opposed by small retailers citing job elimination due to increased efficiency and lowered prices due to fewer losses and lower costs.\nIndia's true Big box format store was opened by IKEA in city of Hyderabad.\n\nIn Ireland, large merchandise stores in the style of U.S. superstores were not a part of the retail sector until the late 20th century. Dunnes Stores have traditionally had a supermarket-plus-household-and-clothes model and now have some large stores. Tesco Ireland now runs upwards of 19 hypermarkets across the country.\n\nThe big-box phenomenon hit New Zealand in the late 1980s, with the introduction of Kmart Australia and later the \"Warehouse\" superstore, a local company. Mitre 10 New Zealand opened their first Mega in 2004 at Hastings, New Zealand six months before the Australian Mega store; it opened to great success with 20 more stores opening within two years. Australian-owned Bunnings Warehouse opened its first store in New Zealand in 2006.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Makro and Costco membership-only warehouse club stores have been around for 3 decades. General merchandise shops along the lines of U.S. superstores are not a large part of the retail sector, but this has been changing in recent years, with the creation of extra-large supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda selling a broader range of non-food goods, typically in out-of-town shopping centres or retail parks. As in the US, such large shops are sometimes called \"anchor tenants\". The growth of online retail and budget retail has led to these chains moving away from the large out-of-town supermarkets which have waned in popularity.\n\nThe term \"big-box store\" is not used in the UK. \"Superstore\" is sometimes used, but with a slightly different meaning: on road signs it means \"large supermarket\"; in self-service shop names it denotes an outlet larger than that particular chain's usual size.\n\nIn the United States, some big-box stores may specialize in categories of merchandise (\"category killer\"), such as Best Buy in electronics and appliances and Kohl's, Burlington, and Nordstrom Rack in apparel and home furnishings.\n\nBig-box general merchandise retailers such as Target and Walmart are similar to the global concept of a hypermarket, although they do not always have a grocery section, and the term \"hypermarket\" is not in common use in the United States. \"Discount store\", \"megastore\", and \"superstore\" are sometimes used in addition to the industry term \"general merchandise retailer\". The category has its origins with Walmart, Kmart and Meijer in the 1960s, which were called \"discount stores\" — still an industry term for this type of store — and which between the 1960s and 1980s started to open larger-format stores called \"megastores\".\n\nWarehouse club stores are another category of big box general merchandise stores, such as Sam's Club, Costco, and BJ's Wholesale Club. They require membership to purchase and often require purchasing larger quantities of goods at once.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1891598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891598", "title": "Ernst Mally", "text": "Ernst Mally\n\nErnst Mally (; ; 11 October 1879 – 8 March 1944) was an Austrian philosopher affiliated with the so-called Graz School of phenomenological psychology. A pupil of Alexius Meinong, he was one of the founders of deontic logic and is mainly known for his contributions in that field of research.\n\nMally was born in the town of Kranj () in the Duchy of Carniola, Austria-Hungary (now in Slovenia). His father was of Slovene origin, but identified himself with Austrian German culture (he also Germanized the orthography of his surname, originally spelled Mali, a common Slovene surname of Upper Carniola). After his death, the family moved to the Carniolan capital of Ljubljana (). There, Ernst attended the prestigious Ljubljana German language Gymnasium. Already at a young age, Mally became a fervent supporter of the Pan-German nationalist movement of Georg von Schönerer. In the same time, he developed an interest in philosophy.\n\nIn 1898, he enrolled in the University of Graz, where he studied philosophy under the supervision of Alexius Meinong, as well as physics and mathematics, specializing in formal logic. He graduated in 1903 with a doctoral thesis entitled \"Untersuchungen zur Gegenstandstheorie des Messens\" (\"Investigations in the Object Theory of Measurement\"). In 1906 he started teaching at a high school in Graz, at the same time collaborating with Adalbert Meingast and working as Meinong's assistant at the university. He also maintained close contacts with the Laboratory for Experimental Psychology, founded by Meinong. In 1912, he wrote his \"habilitation thesis]] entitled \"Gegenstandstheoretische Grundlagen der Logik und Logistik\" (\"Object-theoretic Foundations for Logics and Logistics\") with Meinong as supervisor.\n\nFrom 1915 to 1918 he served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the end of World War I, Mally joined the Greater German People's Party, which called the unification of German Austria with Germany. In the same period, he started teaching at the university and in 1925 he took over Meinong's chair. In 1938, he became a member of the National Socialist Teachers' Association and two months after the \"Anschluss\" he joined the NSDAP. He continued teaching during the Nazi administration of Austria until 1942 when he retired. He died in 1944 in Schwanberg.\n\nMally was the first logician ever to attempt an axiomatization of ethics (Mally 1926). He used five axioms, which are given below. They form a first-order theory that quantifies over propositions, and there are several predicates to understand first. !x means that x ought to be the case. Ux means that x is unconditionally obligatory, i.e. that !x is necessarily true. ∩x means that x is unconditionally forbidden, i.e. U(¬x). A f B is the binary relation A requires B, i.e. A materially implies !B. (All entailment in the axioms is material conditional.) It is defined by axiom III, whereas all other terms are defined as a preliminary.\n\nformula_1\nNote the implied universal quantifiers in the above axioms.\n\nThe fourth axiom has confused some logicians because its formulation is not as they would have expected, since Mally gave each axiom a description in words also, and he said that axiom IV meant \"the unconditionally obligatory is obligatory\", i.e. (as many logicians have insisted) UA → !A. Meanwhile, axiom 5 lacks an object to which the predicates apply, a typo. However, it turns out these are the least of Mally's worries (see below).\n\nTheorem: This axiomatization of deontic logic implies that !x if and only if x is true, OR !x is unsatisfiable. (This makes it useless to deontic logicians.)\nProof: Using axiom III, axiom I may be rewritten as (!(A → B) & (B → C)) → !(A → C). Since B → C holds whenever C holds, one immediate consequence is that (!(A → B) → (C → !(A → C))). In other words, if A requires B, it requires any true statement. In the special case where A is a tautology, the theorem has consequence (!B → (C → !C)). Thus, if at least one statement ought be true, every statement must materially entail it ought be true, and so every true statement ought be true. As for the converse (i.e. if some statement ought be true then all statements that ought be true are true), consider the following logic: ((U → !A) & (A → ∩)) → (U → !∩) is a special case of axiom I, but its consequent contradicts axiom V, and so ¬((U → !A) & (A → ∩)). The result !A → A can be shown to follow from this, since !A implies that U → !A and ¬A implies that A → ∩; and, since these are not both true, we know that !A → A.\n\nMally thought that axiom I was self-evident, but he likely confused it with an alternative in which the implication B → C is \"logical\", which would indeed make the axiom self-evident. The theorem above, however, would then not be demonstrable. The theorem was proven by Karl Menger, the next deontic logician. Neither Mally's original axioms nor a modification that avoids this result remains popular today. Menger did not suggest his own axioms. (See also deontic logic for more on the subsequent development of this subject.)\n\nMally developed a realistic approach to ontology (Mally 1935) and saw himself in opposition to the Vienna Circle and the logical positivists.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1891604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891604", "title": "Aperture priority", "text": "Aperture priority\n\nAperture priority, often abbreviated A or Av (for aperture value) on a camera mode dial, is a setting on some cameras that allows the user to set a specific aperture value (f-number) while the camera selects a shutter speed to match it that will result in proper exposure based on the lighting conditions as measured by the camera's light meter. This is different from manual mode, where the user must decide both values, shutter priority where the user picks a shutter speed with the camera selecting an appropriate aperture, or program mode where the camera selects both.\n\nAs an image's depth of field is inversely proportional to the size of the lens's aperture, aperture priority mode is often used to allow the photographer to control the focus of objects in the frame. Aperture priority is therefore useful in landscape photography, for example, where it may be desired that objects in foreground, middle distance, and background all be rendered crisply, while shutter speed is immaterial. To obtain this large depth of field, a narrow aperture (identified by a \"high\" f-number, e.g. f/16 or f/22) is necessary. Aperture priority mode also finds use in portrait photography, where a wide aperture (identified by a \"low\" number, e.g. f/1.4 or f/2.8) and therefore smaller depth of field may be desired to throw the background out of focus and make it less distracting.\n\nAnother common use of aperture priority mode is to indirectly affect shutter speed for a desired effect. In landscape photography, a user might select a small aperture when photographing a waterfall, so that the camera will select a slow shutter speed (to allow a sufficient amount of light to reach the film or sensor for proper exposure), thereby causing the water to blur through the frame. At the contrary, a larger aperture allows to shorten the shutter speed reducing the hand jitter by taking a picture without a tripod or, in alternative, a lower ISO to enhance the image quality by reducing the noise.\nWhen shooting a portrait in dim lighting, the photographer might choose to open the lens to its maximum aperture in hopes of getting enough light for a good exposure while maintaining the shortest possible shutter speed to reduce blur.\n\n"}

She gave birth to Franklin in 1882, and was a devoted mother to him for the remainder of her life, including home schooling and living close by in adulthood. She had a complex relationship with her daughter-in-law Eleanor, which has led to media portrayals of her as a domineering and fearsome mother-in-law, though these are at odds with other views. She died in 1941, with her son, then the President, at her side.\n\nSara Delano was born at the Delano Estate in the town of Newburgh, New York, to Warren Delano Jr. and Catherine Robbins Lyman. She had ten siblings, two of whom died as small children. Three more died in their twenties.\n\nIn 1862, Sara, her mother Catherine, and six brothers and sisters traveled to Hong Kong on the clipper ship \"Surprise\", where they joined Warren Delano who had resumed his business of trading in opium, then still legal.\nOn board ship, Sara enjoyed spending time in the sailmaker's loft listening to the sailmaker tell sea stories. Her brother Fred discovered Catherine's journal of the voyage many years later, in 1928. In 1865, she moved with her family back to Newburgh. She was educated at home, aside from a brief period in a girls' school in Dresden, Germany in 1876.\n\nDelano was described as 5'10\" (178 cm), and an intelligent debutante beauty in her youth. She was also known for her sense of purpose that many young women of her age and class lacked at the time.\n\nAfter many suitors, Sara married James Roosevelt I in 1880. Two years later, she gave birth to a son, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on January 30, 1882. After the birth of her son, doctors advised Sara not to have any more children, and thus the young Franklin became the focus of her attention. Many wealthy parents of this time period relied on servants to care for their children, but not Sara. She taught Franklin reading and geography, and employed tutors rather than sending him to a conventional school. After the death of her husband in 1900, she temporarily moved to Boston, Massachusetts to be close to her son who was then studying at Harvard University.\n\nSara did not approve of many of the women that her son courted. When Franklin fell in love with his distant cousin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sara was determined to change his mind. She tried to coerce him out of the engagement, but with no luck, she insisted that her son keep his arrangement a secret for over a year. Sara was heavily involved in the lives of Franklin and Eleanor's children. She often offered advice on how to raise them, and frequently undermined the couple's disciplinary skills by spoiling her grandchildren. Eleanor often relied on Sara's direction to make her feel more secure in her role of being a mother.\n\nThough Sara became known popularly as a stereotypical domineering mother-in-law after being portrayed as much in the film \"Sunrise at Campobello\", her actual relationship with Eleanor was much more complex. The pair grew close during the early years of the marriage as Eleanor's mother had died when she was young, and she used Sara as a surrogate mother to discuss issues. She supported Eleanor after she discovered Franklin's affair with Lucy Mercer, which put the marriage close to collapse. However, the relationship began to be more distant after Eleanor became more heavily involved in politics and activism.\n\nFranklin Roosevelt never had a home of his own that was separate from that of his mother's. In 1906, Roosevelt commissioned a pair of houses to be built at E 65 Street, New York City, as a wedding present for Franklin and his wife, Eleanor, on the strict condition that she could move in next to them. She oversaw a series of connecting doors between the houses, allowing her access to the drawing room and children's bedrooms in the neighbouring property. Her son and daughter-in-law moved out after Franklin took office in the White House in 1933.\n\nShe lived to see Franklin elected President of the United States three times, becoming the first Presidential mother to vote for her son. Sara continued to support her son's career, even standing in as First Lady on several occasions. She was always prepared to say something positive about her son, and remained highly protective of him and his family.\n\nSara Delano Roosevelt died on September 7, 1941 with the President at her side, two weeks before her 87th birthday.\n\"Minutes after her death, the largest oak tree at Hyde Park toppled to the ground. It was a clear windless day.\"\n\nThe funeral was held at Springwood. The President can be seen wearing a black mourning band on his arm in photographs of him later signing the declaration of war against Japan. His mother's memory is commemorated with the Sara Delano Roosevelt Park in New York City's Lower East Side, which was dedicated during her lifetime, in 1934. She was buried next to her husband at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park.\n\nIn 2003, the City University of New York announced they would restore Roosevelt's former home, now known as the Sara Delano Roosevelt Memorial House, on 47 East 65th Street, where she lived from 1908 until her death.\n\n\nCitations\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

It consisted of the local branch of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the Malay Union, the local chapters of the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress, and former Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock's Singapore People's Alliance (SPA).\n\nThis alliance was formalized on June 24, 1963 as the Singaporean component of the ruling Alliance Party in Malaya. Its campaign policy during the 1963 elections was similar to what the UMNO used in federal elections in Malaysia, and alleged the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) mistreated the Malays, one of the major races in Singapore. While the Singapore Alliance also supported merger within the Federation of Malaysia and was anti-Communist, it sought to extend the same model of communal politics on the mainland to Singapore. Unlike the then-left-leaning and socialist PAP, it was identified with the political right.\n\nThroughout its history, the Singapore Alliance has only held seven seats with the SPA holding four seats and the Singapore United Malay National Organization occupying three seats in Malay-dominated areas like Geylang Serai, Kampung Kembangan, and the Southern Islands. During the 1963 general election, the Alliance performed poorly and lost all its seats. Its participation in the 1963 election further heightened tensions between UMNO and the PAP as they had earlier agreed neither side would participate in each other's elections until Malaysia, which Singapore was then an autonomous state of, was more mature.\n\nAfter the 1963 elections, the Singapore Alliance was left in the political wilderness. While the coalition was briefly reformed and re-registered as the \"Alliance Party Singapura\" in 1966, it did contest any future elections in Singapore and gradually faded from the political scene. Most of its component parties eventually ceased to operate with the exception of Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura, which subsequently joined the Singapore Democratic Alliance.\n\n"}

{"id": "1891639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1891639", "title": "Salmon isavirus", "text": "Salmon isavirus\n\nInfectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a viral disease of Atlantic salmon (\"Salmo salar\") caused by Salmon isavirus. It affects fish farms in Canada, Norway, Scotland and Chile, causing severe losses to infected farms. ISA has been a World Organisation for Animal Health notifiable disease since 1990. In the EU, it is classified as a non-exotic disease, and is monitored by the European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases.\n\nISA is caused by the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). ISAV, a RNA virus, is the only species in the genus \"Isavirus\" which is in the family Orthomyxoviridae, and therefore related to the influenza viruses.\n\nThe genome encodes at least 10 proteins.\n\nThere are several distinct strains of the virus. The most common are a European strain and a North American strain.\n\nISA virus causes severe anemia in infected fish. Unlike the mature red blood cells of mammals, the mature red blood cells of fish contain DNA, and can become infected by viruses. The fish develop pale gills, and may swim close to the water surface, gulping for air. However, the fish may show no external signs of illness and maintain a normal appetite, until suddenly dying. The disease can progress slowly throughout an infected farm and, in the worst cases, death rates may approach 100%. Post-mortem examination of the fish has shown a wide range of causes of death. The liver and spleen may be swollen, congested or partially already dead. The circulatory system may stop working, and the blood may be contaminated with dead blood cells. Red blood cells still present burst easily, and the numbers of immature and damaged blood cells are increased.\n\nInfectious salmon anemia appears to be most like influenza viruses. Its mode of transfer and the natural reservoirs of infectious salmon anemia virus are not fully understood. Apart from Atlantic salmon, both sea-run Brown trout (\"Salmo trutta\") and Rainbow trout (\"Onchorhyncus mykiss\") can be infected, but do not become sick, so it is thought possible that these species may act as notable carriers and reservoirs of the virus.\n\nResearch shows that while several species of Pacific salmon can be carriers of the virus, even highly pathogenic strains, Pacific salmon currently show high relative resistance and no ISAV-related symptoms. However, the potential for ISAV adaptation to Pacific salmon exists.\n\nIn the autumn of 1984, a new disease was observed in Atlantic salmon being farmed along the southwest coast of Norway. The disease, which was named infectious salmon anemia, spread slowly, but caused the death of up to 80% of salmon stock in some hatcheries. By June 1988 it had become sufficiently widespread and serious to require the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to declare it a notifiable disease.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, a new disease appeared in Atlantic salmon being farmed in New Brunswick, Canada. The death rate of the fish on affected farms was very high and, following extensive scientific examination of the victims, the disease was named \"hemorrhagic kidney syndrome.\" Although the source and distribution of this disease was not known, the results of studies by Norwegian and Canadian scientists showed conclusively that the same virus was responsible for both infectious salmon anemia and hemorrhagic kidney syndrome.\n\nIn May 1998, a salmon farm at Loch Nevis on the west coast of Scotland reported its suspicions of an outbreak of infectious salmon anemia. The suspicions were confirmed, and by the end of the year, the disease had spread to an additional fifteen farms not only on the Scottish mainland but also on Skye and Shetland.\n\nIn 2008, there was an outbreak of ISA in Shetland. ISA was detected in fish from just one site. There is no evidence the disease has spread beyond this site, but two nearby SSF cages are under suspicion of carrying the disease and are also now clear of fish.\n\nIn 2011, two wild Pacific salmon taken from the central coast of British Columbia were suspected to have ISA after preliminary tests showed possible evidence of the virus. However, extensive testing by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to try to amplify and culture the virus were unsuccessful, prompting the agency to conclude that the ISA virus was not present. In February 2012, a confirmed outbreak of ISA in Nova Scotia resulted in the destruction of up to 750,000 salmon. In July 2012, a confirmed outbreak of infectious salmon anemia in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, prompted the destruction of 450,000 farmed salmon by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and an outbreak was also confirmed at another site in late 2012. In mid-2012, another outbreak was identified in Nova Scotia, with the 240,000 fish being allowed by CFIA to mature to market size before being harvested in early 2013 by the operator and processed for the consumer market. After being held by the CFIA, the fish was declared fit for human consumption despite the presence of the virus as the disease \"poses no risk to human health\". In January 2016, it was announced that the virus had been discovered in farmed and wild salmon British Columbia for the first time.\n\nIn Chile, ISA was first isolated from a salmon farm in the 1990s and described for the first time in 2001, although the initial presence never resulted in widespread problems. However, since June 2007, the national industry has been dealing with a serious ISA outbreak which has not yet been completely brought under control and has been responsible for an important decline in the industry, closure of many farms and high unemployment. The virus was detected in an Atlantic salmon farm in Chiloé Archipelago in Los Lagos Region and spread to the fjords and channels of Aysén Region to the south almost immediately.\n\nThe virus is spread by contact with infected fish or their secretions, or contact with equipment or people who have handled infected fish. The virus can survive in seawater, so a major risk factor for any uninfected farm is its proximity to an already infected farm.\n\nThe \"Lepeophtheirus salmonis\" sea louse, a small crustacean parasite that attacks the protective mucus, scales and skin of the salmon, can carry the virus passively on its surface and in its digestive tract. Under laboratory conditions \"Lepeophtheirus salmonis\" can passively transfer ISA. It is not known whether the ISA virus can reproduce itself in the sea louse, although this is a possibility as viruses can use secondary vectors for transmission, for example Arboviruses such as dengue fever, West Nile virus, or African swine fever virus.\n\nClinical signs and pathology may suggest infection. Viral identification is possible using immunofluorescence and PCR.\n\nThere is no treatment once fish are infected.\n\nISA is a major threat to the viability of salmon farming and is now the first of the diseases classified on List One of the European Commission’s fish health regime. Amongst other measures, this requires the total eradication of the entire fish stock should an outbreak of the disease be confirmed on any farm. The economic and social consequences of both the disease and the measures used to control it are thus very far reaching.\n\nInfectious salmon anemia is currently regarded as a serious threat not only to farmed Atlantic salmon, but also to dwindling stocks of wild Atlantic salmon. Recent research involving a multi-year study of wild Atlantic salmon from North America shows that infected salmon that survive infection generate antibodies against the virus. Work is now underway to develop a vaccine against ISA.\n\nThere are several distinct strains of the virus, some are pathogenic and some are not. The most common are a European strain and a North American strain.\n\nGenetic research into the ISA virus shows that the European and North American strains of the virus diverged from each other sometime around 1900. This research points out that starting in 1879 when rainbow trout were first brought to Europe from North America, there were many transfers of fish across the Atlantic ocean which may have carried the ISA virus. Some species were introduced to Europe from North America, and some species were introduced to North America from Europe. Given that the virus did not evolve into two separate strains until around 1900, and given how many transfers of fish there were, according to this research, \"At present it is therefore not possible to suggest a geographical origin of the ISA virus.\"\n\nAnother study suggests that this virus was introduced into Norway between 1932 and 1959 and that the original strain was the European subtype found in North America. The strains found in Chile were transmitted from Norway between 1995 and 2007.\n\n"}

The song was written by Clarkson with its producers Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken. It was released as the fourth and final single from the album, being first serviced to US contemporary hit radio on November 12, 2003. \"The Trouble with Love Is\" is an R&B and soul ballad, with elements of gospel music in its chorus. Lyrically, the song finds Clarkson explaining how love can be joyful and sorrowful at the same time. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised it for being \"soulful\" and \"romantic\", while also praising Clarkson's vocals, comparing them to those of Mariah Carey and Beyoncé.\n\nCommercially, while failing to match \"Miss Independent\" success on the charts in the United States, the song performed considerably better internationally, reaching number eleven and a gold status in Australia, while also reaching significant positions in other three countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom. The song also served to promote the Christmas romantic comedy \"Love Actually\" (2003), being featured in its accompanying soundtrack. The music video for the song was directed by Bryan Barber and released on November 7, 2003. It features scenes from the film, while Clarkson performs the track on a rooftop. Clarkson performed the track during her Independent Tour (2004) and Breakaway World Tour (2005).\n\n\"The Trouble with Love Is\" was written by Kelly Clarkson with its producers Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers. Sturken was also responsible for drum programming and keyboards, while Rogers provided background vocals with Cindy Mizelle. The song was recorded at four different studios: The Hit Factory, New York City; The Record Plant, Los Angeles; The Enterprise, Burbank, California; and The Loft Recording Studio, Bronxville, New York. Its strings were recorded at a different studio: The Studio, Philadelphia. The song features drums, violins, violas, cellos, keyboards and strings in its instrumentation. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Group, the song is written in the key of F major with a tempo of 60 beats per minute in common time. The song follows a chord progression of F – A7 – B – D - B, and Clarkson's vocals span from the low-note of B to the high note of F. \"The Trouble with Love Is\" is an R&B and soul song, with elements of gospel throughout the chorus. Lyrically, it talks about the ups and downs of romance, with Clarkson singing, \"Love may be a many splendored thing ... [But] it can tear you up inside/ Make your heart believe a lie.\"\n\nFollowing the release of \"Low\", which maintained her strong-hold on stateside fans, \"The Trouble with Love Is\" was announced as the album's third and final single, though there were fans who pant for the ballad \"Anytime\" to be released. It was first serviced to US mainstream radio on November 12, 2003 in the United States, and later released as a double A-side single with \"Low\" in the United Kingdom on November 17, 2003. It was released in the remaining countries on January 12, 2004. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 film \"Love Actually\".\n\nThe song received positive reviews from most music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic picked the song as one of the best tracks on the album, while Heather Phares of the same publication praised the track for \"manag[ing] to be romantic, sassy, and empowering all at once, with her vocals reflecting their urban ballad surroundings.\" Chuck Taylor of \"Billboard\" wrote a positive review, noting that Clarkson \"mines her soulful side and riffs like a sista with the gospel-drenched [track].\" Caroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" praised the singer, writing that \"[l]ike her fellow Texan Beyoncé, she has a background in the church, and it shows in the phrasing of the torchy song.\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song a \"durable soul number reminiscent of Mariah Carey's 'Vision of Love'. A writer of the website Sputnikmusic named it a \"swooning, soulful, radiant song, with gospel-esque background vocals in the chorus that stands out amongst most pop music that plagues the music scene today with mediocrity.\" Mike Wass of Idolator described it as \"a bluesy ballad that is an early preview of the diva’s eventual flirtation with roots and blues.\"\n\nWhile failing to match \"Miss Independent\" in the United States, \"The Trouble with Love Is\" performed considerably better internationally. In Australia, the song debuted at number twelve on February 22, 2004, while the next week it reached a peak of number eleven on the ARIA Charts week of February 29, 2004, remaining at the peak position for a further week. It matched the same peak position of the previous single, \"Low\", and ultimately, the song was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 35,000 copies. In Netherlands, the song peaked higher than her previous single, \"Miss Independent\", debuting at number eighty-one, on December 27, 2003, and reaching number twenty-six, on January 24, 2004. In Switzerland, the song became Clarkson's lowest charting-single of her career, peaking at number sixty-two. In the United States, \"The Trouble with Love Is\" did not chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, but made its appearance on three Billboard component charts: the Top 40 Mainstream chart, where it peaked at number twenty-two, the Adult Top 40, reaching number thirty-one, and the Top 40 Tracks, where it reached number thirty-six. On the Canadian Hot 100, the song performed significantly at number twenty-five.\n\nThe music video for the song was directed by Bryan Barber and premiered on November 7, 2003, on \"TRL\". The video features Clarkson performing the track on a rooftop in downtown Los Angeles, with people watching \"Love Actually\" on a rooftop adjacent to the one Clarkson's on. As noted by MTV News' Corey Moss, \"along with the high-altitude shots, Barber also created several vignettes showing kids dealing with troubled relationships, which [were] interspersed with the performance footage. The scenes [took] place in the rooms of the building Kelly is performing on and include[s] a girl fighting for attention from her video-game addict boyfriend and another girl climbing on the fire escape after arguing with her mother.\"\n\nClarkson promoted the song with a handful of live performances, including The Ellen Show, Pop Idol, \"Today\" \"Live on Air\", AOL Music, Smile and Popworld. Clarkson also performed the track on her Independent Tour (2004), Hazel Eyes Tour and last on the \"Breakaway World Tour\" (2005-2006). In 2012, on her Stronger Tour, Clarkson performed the track on a medley with \"Walk Away\", \"How I Feel\" and \"I Want You\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Thankful\", RCA Records.\n"}

He held the IBF junior middleweight title in 2013, and is the first boxer from Las Vegas to become a world champion. During his early career, he participated in the first season of the reality TV show \"The Contender\" in 2005.\n\nSmith grew up in Nevada with his mother and siblings but never knew his father. As an amateur Smith competed on the national stage for years. In 1996 he made it to the finals of the US National Championships, losing a competitive match on points to Héctor Camacho Jr., and semifinals of the U.S. Olympic trials, losing on points to Zab Judah. In 1999, he lost on points in another close bout in the quarterfinals of the US National Championships to Larry Mosley, who went on to win the tournament.\n\nSmith was a strong prospect early in his career, he won his first fourteen fights while facing generally strong opposition. In 2001, he faced Alfonso Gomez in his fourth pro fight (Alfonso's second pro fight). Smith won via a controversial unanimous decision (due to a low-blow penalty against Gomez that was poorly called) in a four-round fight. Later that year, he beat Norberto Bravo by unanimous decision. Most notably, in 2003 he dominated David \"King\" Estrada, a fellow hot prospect at the time, beating him by a wide unanimous decision.\n\nIn 2004, Smith won his first belts (WBC Continental Welterweight title, WBO NABO Welterweight title, and USBA Welterweight title), beating the former world champion Randall Bailey by a controversial unanimous decision. In an economical punching fight, Smith scored a knockdown in the second round and showed better defense, but Bailey was a bit more active throughout, particularly in the last three rounds with an effective jab. There was little to separate the two men in terms of scoring the fight, but Smith won by scores of 116-111, 117-110, and 114-113.\n\nIshe took a chance and signed on to do \"The Contender\" reality show. He was assigned as a roommate to his former adversary Alfonso Gomez. On the show, he was placed on the West Coast team and fought his rival Ahmed Kaddour in the third episode's fight. Smith won by unanimous decision against Kaddour in a tough fight. Smith criticized Anthony Bonsante for fighting Brent Cooper, whom he did not think was an appropriate competitor. Their bout had no bearing on Smith's standing in the competition.\n\nWhen Juan de la Rosa was medically disqualified at the end of the first round fight, certain other boxers bought back Kaddour, a tactic employed to get under Smith's skin. After Brinkley criticized Smith for speaking his mind too often, Brinkley selected the fighter to go against Sergio Mora. Mora won over Smith in a split decision and was the tournament's eventual winner.\n\nSmith faced his nemesis Bonsante in a \"Fan Favorite Fight\". Despite suffering many illegal moves from a desperate Bonsante, Smith won by a wide unanimous decision.\n\nSome of Smith's earlier challengers in the ring also appeared on \"The Contender\", namely, Alfonso Gomez and Norberto Bravo.\n\nSince appearing on \"The Contender\", Smith has criticized the show's management company for trying to force him to fight Jesse Brinkley at a severe weight disadvantage for a relatively small fight purse. A natural welterweight, Smith feels that he should have been allowed to drop back down to a lower weight class and fight more rounds against opponents outside \"The Contender\" in preparation for an eventual title shot, or be allowed out of the show's management contract as \"Contender\" contestants Ahmed Kaddour and Jimmy Lange, among others, have been.\n\nSmith won his arbitration trial. He left the \"Contender\" promotions and signed a contract with Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions. Smith has been under Bernard Hopkins' guidance since joining that company.\n\nSmith was featured on a June 7, 2006 fight card promoted by Bernard Hopkins on ESPN \"Friday Night Fight\", where he dominated his opponent Patrick Thompson through 10 rounds to get a unanimous decision. He fought at 154 lbs, in the junior middleweight division, which is considered a division with many opportunities for young prospects.\n\nSmith fought Sechew Powell, a junior middleweight contender on February 17, 2007, and lost a unanimous decision, potentially halting his hopes of landing a title shot. Smith lost the fight despite scoring a knock down. After the decision was announced, many of Powell's hometown fans booed the decision. The judges gave Powell eight out of ten rounds. The fight was very slow as neither man wanted to let his hands go much, so the booing may have been for the lackluster nature of the fight.\n\nSmith lost a razor-close decision to Joel Julio on April 30, 2008. Julio outworked Smith in the early rounds of the fight, but Smith came on strong in the 2nd half of the fight to make it interesting. Julio went on to lose his next two fights, one by TKO.\n\nSmith returned to the ring on August 1, 2008, winning by unanimous decision over the previously undefeated Pawel Wolak. Describing the bout for him as \"a do or die, must win situation\", he delivered, outboxing the somewhat plodding Wolak in one of his most consistent performances. He followed that with a workmanlike unanimous decision win over Chris Gray in a stay-busy fight.\n\nSmith lost to Danny Jacobs on August 22, 2009, but he had his moments in the fight and was definitely was crowd pleasing. Smith had moved up to Middleweight to challenge Jacobs. Smith vowed to go back to Jr Middleweight and make a run at the title, but his next fight was again at middleweight July 16, 2010 in Memphis, Tennessee against Fernando Guerrero, an explosive southpaw Middleweight prospect.\n\nSmith and Guerrero fought on ShoBox in a ten-round competitive action affair. For the first half of the fight, Guerrero seemed to have a slight edge, as he outlanded and outworked Smith; the latter used many body shots, some being low, resulting in him losing a point. The tide turned heavily in Smith's favor in Round 8; he dropped Guerrero with a strong right hand at the end of the round. Smith had a very strong Round 9 and a good Round 10, though Guerrero had his moments in the final round as well. Though it appeared the scores could have gone either way by the end of the fight and Smith closed strong, Guerrero won 96-93, 95-93, and a surprising score of 97-91. Smith said afterward that he would like to return to Light Middleweight to make a run and/or get a fight with Julio César Chávez, Jr.\n\nSoon after the Guerrero fight, Smith took a stay-busy fight which he easily won. He went on a long layoff, during which he stayed in the news mostly doing various boxing mailbags: commenting on the sport for websites such as BoxingScene and BoxingTalk. He also did sparring work for various camps. After more than a year and a half layoff, Smith returned to the ring in May 2012 against Ayi Bruce, winning easily via 4th round TKO at 154 lbs, and then September 8 won all 10 rounds on 2 cards and 9 of 10 on the 3rd card vs Irving Garcia for his 2nd straight 154 lb division victory, earning him his first world title challenge for Contender Season 2 Bronze medalist Cornelius Bundrage's IBF 154 lb belt scheduled February 23, 2013.\n\nOn February 23, 2013 Ishe Smith won a majority decision victory over Cornelius Bundrage to become the new IBF junior middleweight champion. On September 14, 2013, Smith lost his title to Carlos Molina by split decision. Many commentators rergarded the fight as a humdrum affair lacking any meaningful action, specifically on Smith's part. Two judges scored the bout 116-112 and 117-111 for Molina and one of the judges scored the bout 116-112 for Ishe.\n\nOriginally, Smith was supposed to face Erislandy Lara, but ultimately ended up facing Ryan Davis on May 2, 2014 after Lara elected to instead challenge Saúl \"Canelo\" Álvarez directly. Smith knocked Davis out at the end of the second round.\n"}

Known as the Putumayo in the former three nations, it is called the Içá when it crosses into Brazil. The Putumayo originates in the Andes Mountains east of the city of Pasto, Colombia. It empties into the Solimões (upper Amazon) near the municipality of Santo Antônio do Içá, Brazil. Major tributaries include the Guamués River, San Miguel, Güeppí, Cumpuya, Algodón, Igara-Paraná, Yaguas, Cotuhé, and Paraná de Jacurapá rivers.\nThe river flows through the Solimões-Japurá moist forests ecoregion.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Içá was navigated by the French explorer Jules Crevaux (1847–1882). He ascended it in a steamer drawing of water, and running day and night. He reached Cuembí, above its mouth, without finding a single rapid. Cuembí is only from the Pacific Ocean, in a straight line, passing through the town of Pasto in southern Colombia. Creveaux discovered the river sediments to be free of rock to the base of the Andes; the river banks were of argillaceous earth and the bottom of fine sand.\n\nDuring the Amazon rubber boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the land around the Putumayo became a major rubber-producing region, where Julio César Arana's Peruvian Amazon Company maintained a production network centered on the nearby city of Iquitos. This production network mainly relied on the labor of indigenous Indians, who suffered from widespread human rights abuses. These abuses were first publicized in 1909 within the British press by the American engineer Walter Hardenburg, who had been briefly imprisoned by Arana's private police force in 1907 while visiting the region; Hardenburg later published his book \"The Putumayo: The Devil's Paradise\" in 1913.\n\nIn response to Hardenburg's exposé, the British government sent the consul Roger Casement (who had previously publicized Belgian atrocities in the rubber business of the Congo Free State) to investigate the matter; between 1910 and 1911, Casement subsequently wrote a series of condemnatory reports criticizing the atrocities of the PAC, for which he received a knighthood.\n\nCasement's reports later formed much of the basis for the 1987 book \"Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man\" by the anthropologist Michael Taussig, which analyzed how the acts of terror committed by British capitalists along the Putumayo River in Colombia had created a distinct \"space of death.\"\n\nToday the river is a major transport route. Almost the entire length of the river is navigated by boats.\n\nCattle farming, along with the rubber trade, is also a major industry on the banks of the Içá. Rubber and balatá (a substance very much like gutta-percha, to the point where it is often called gutta-balatá) from the Içá area are shipped to Manaus, Brazil.\n\nOn March 1, 2008, Raúl Reyes and 14 of his fellow Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla companions were killed while on the Ecuadorian side of the border by Colombian military forces.\n\n"}
